										<!--TEXT BEGINS HERE-->	ORE than a quarter century ago the painter Ad Reinhardt declared that his new

black-on-black canvases were the "last pictures which anyone can make." The

critics raved, and many agreed with the "Black Monk" that his masterpieces

would be history's "ultimate" paintings. Unfortunately, other artists refused

to hand in their brushes, so art continued.

Ever since, modern art has resembled a doomsday cult on the day after the

deadline for the end of the world. The true believers awoke one day to find

that the sun had risen, the mad prophet had disappeared, and they all had to

find something to do with the rest of their lives.<p>

<p>

		



	

										

	

This predicament is now called Postmodernism, and if you're confused about it,

that's probably because you're beginning to understand it. If you're an artist,

what follows will be old hat. But as a service to the layman I can define a few

of the basic terms. <p>



<B>Modern Art:</B> In the future "modern art" will mean "the kind of art they did in

the twentieth century." Like "Baroque"or "Romanesque," "modern" will be a term

used to date something.<p>



<B>Cubism:</B> A movement started by Picasso and <A HREF="http://netspot.city.unisa.edu.au/wm/paint/auth/braque/">Braque</A> to distinguish their work

 from

what <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/wm/paint/auth/cezanne/works.html">C&eacute;zanne</A> had already done. Critics named it Cubism. In modern art,

naming your art movement is a must. Cubism is still the most important

modern-art movement, for the same reason that John D. is still the most

important Rockefeller. All the other movements are like downtown Rockefellers,

and you can forget about them unless you expect to encounter an art category on

<i>Jeopardy</i>.<p>



<B>Futurism:</B> This was a movement of intellectuals who wanted to replace

 tradition

with the modern world of machinery, speed, violence, and public relations. It

proves that we should be careful what intellectuals wish for, because we might

get it.<p>



<B>Dada:</B> <A HREF="http://www.mercon.com/mercon/pyramid/edjames/surrdada.html">Dada</A> artists were ironists. Duchamp was their star, and his masterpiece

was a urinal. He ended his life playing chess. He claimed he was making an art

statement. My grandfather was a prankster too, and he ended his life playing

chess. But since he did it to keep from being bored, no one thought it proved

anything. This suggests that Dada artists are exempt from the general rule that

ironists are the biggest victims of their own irony.<p>



<B>Surrealism:</B> An archaic term. Formerly an art movement, no longer distinguishable

from everyday life.<p>



<B>Abstract Expressionism:</B> After the Second World War the United States emerged as

the world's superpower. American companies like Cities Service and Esso, which

had once been regional businesses, became international corporations. They

adopted abstract names like Citgo and Exxon to give themselves world-class

status. Since multinational giants couldn't have little pictures of red barns

or weeping clowns in the lobbies of their Bauhaus buildings, Abstract

Expressionism emerged as the world's most prized  form of interior decoration.

<p>



<B>Pop Art:</B> In aristocratic societies rich people used to commission exquisite

paintings for their walls. Years later cheap imitations would filter down to

calendars in gas stations. In our democratic society this works backward. Here

art begins as the kind of picture you'd find on a matchbook cover. Then in a

few years expensive imitations of it wind up on the walls of plastic surgeons

and Hollywood agents.<p>



<B>New Wave Art:</B> Modern art as it would have been done by the Big Bopper, the

Del-Vikings, or Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs. New Wave art was the rage of the

eighties. Now it's exhibited in oldies-but-goodies museums, usually in

black-and-pink frames.<p>



<B>Graffiti Art:</B> Many people decorate their homes with designer graffiti, even

though most of them would probably have real graffiti scoured off the walls of

their buildings. Personally, I think that graffiti artists should go to the

homes of their patrons with spray cans and make their living rooms look like

subway cars. This would separate serious lovers of graffiti from uptowners

spelunking for art thrills.<p>



<B>Realism:</B> Currently, realistic paintings are valued for their craftsmanship. In

the next century, when art will be packaged as virtual-reality software,

realistic paintings will sell the way Shaker furniture does now. Shaker

furniture will sell the way Van Gogh paintings do. Pop-It Beads owned by Jackie

Onassis will come to market only occasionally.<p>



<B>Commercial Art:</B> Anything done by an artist with a cash register by the door.

Commercial art is traditionally delivered to a client in a brown-paper bag with

an invoice stapled to the outside.<p>



<B>Fine Art:</B> With commercial art you find out how much they're going to pay you,

and you do the work. With fine art it's the other way around. <p>



<B>"That's Not Art, That's Illustration":</B> Almost everybody is an artist these

days. Rock-and-roll singers are artists. So are movie directors, performance

artists, makeup artists, tattoo artists, con artists, and rap artists. Movie

stars are artists. Madonna is an artist because she explores her own sexuality.

Snoop Doggy Dogg is an artist because he explores other people's sexuality.

Victims who express their pain are artists. So are guys in prison who express

themselves on shirt cardboard. Even consumers are artists when they express

themselves in their selection of commodities. The only people left in America

who seem not to be artists are illustrators. <p>



<B>Love Me, Love My Art:</B> Norman Rockwell used to say if a picture is going badly,

put a dog in it. If it is going really badly, put a bandage on the dog's

paw. This is the basic principle behind victim art.<p>



<B>Tattoo Art:</B> I've never liked tattoos, although I think they improve some

people--especially the kind of people who hang around tattoo parlors. <p>



<B>Kitsch:</B> In my lifetime kitsch has progressed from the cynical sentimentality of

Maxfield Parrish calendars to the sentimental cynicism of Batman movies. <p>



<B>Style:</B> Style is the most valuable asset of the modern artist. That's probably

why so many styles are reported lost or stolen each year. <p>



<B>Tradition:</B> There are still some traditionalists, mostly employed by art schools,

who continue to paint like members of the Ash Can School, with earnest First

World War realism. For years it has pleased the avant-garde to keep these Amish

around to portray the art establishment. But for generations the real art

establishment has been made up of earth sculptors, body piercers, and topless

cello players. It's been a long time since a painter of the Ash Can School has

even had a prayer.<p>



<B>The Avant-garde:</B> More than a hundred years ago some French bohemians decreed

that the purpose of art was to shock the middle classes. It may have been a

great idea back then. But these days the middle classes aren't paying

attention. They're all on <i>Jerry Springer</i> or <i>Ricki Lake</i>, talking

about their cross-dressing experiences or sex with the baby-sitter.

Cutting-edge artists have to watch this stuff in despair and complain about the

state of American culture even as they demand more grant money to do their

cutting-edge art. In the future this spectacle of the middle classes shocking

the avant-garde will probably become the textbook definition of Postmodernism.

<p>



<B>"Sometimes You Gotta Break the Rules":</B> One of the things not enough people

appreciate about modern art is that its philosophy can be summed up as a Burger

King commercial. <p>



<B>Craftsmanship:</B> Traditional craftsmen worked within certain conventions.

Occasionally those conventions would be redefined by acts of genius. In modern

art, though, everybody has to redefine art all the time. This might have made

our era another Renaissance, if only there had been a sudden explosion of

geniuses in the world. But since ego is more common than genius, Postmodern art

is destined to be more narcissistic than heroic.<p>



<B>Art Theory:</B> The typical modern artist produces a small body of work wrapped in a

theory. Some even dispense with the work itself and exhibit only their

theories, typed up. To me this seems a sensible economy of style. If the

purpose of art is to redefine art, then words should do the trick. There's no

use cluttering up the world with redundant examples.<p>



<B>Self-expression:</B> The crowbar used by artists to pry open the Pandora's box of

self-indulgence for everybody else in society. Thirty years ago it was the

dream of every bohemian artist to be seen getting out of a limousine wearing

blue jeans and sneakers. Today it's the dream of probably half the people in

the country. <p>



<B>The Miracle of Authenticity:</B> The faith that if we're all authentic and express

ourselves, society will benefit. A charming ideal, but it overlooks the

obvious. There are a lot of authentic jerks and idiots in the world.

Encouraging them to express themselves will never do anybody much good, much

less society.<p>



<B>Instinct:</B> Back in the prehistoric jungle all the animals who trusted other

animals got eaten. The only ones who survived to reproduce were the ones who

instinctively feared everybody and bit their heads off. This explains why so

many people who, like artists, trust their instincts behave like crocodiles. <p>



<B>Consciousness-Raising Art:</B> An all-purpose excuse for the artist to cast himself

as a pearl before the swine of democracy. Whenever I know that an artist is

trying to raise my consciousness, I have flashbacks of Jane Fonda, Sissy Spacek,

and Jessica Lange lecturing Congress about the realities of farm life. <p>



<B>Forever Jung:</B> Postmodernists believe that truth is myth and myth truth. This

equation has its roots in pop psychology. The same people also believe that

emotions are a form of reality. There used to be another name for this state of

mind. It was calledpsychosis. <p>



<B>Multiculturalism:</B> I've never understood why artists, who so often condescend to

the clich&eacute;s of their own culture, are so eager to embrace the

clich&eacute;s of cultures they know nothing about.<p>



<B>Waiting for Van Gogh:</B> In the world in which most of us have grown up, popular

art has inherited and exploded all the forms of art that came before it.

Everything from the primitive art of tribal societies to the fine art of

aristocratic ones has been thrown into the cement mixer of modern culture,

along with its juxtapositions of celebrity and anonymity, poverty and sudden

wealth, and the continuous swooning of the popular media over trends and fads.

The truth about Postmodernism is that we haven't really figured out yet how

artists will thrive in modern mass societies. We're all experiments.

Republican legislators may be enviously looking north this month, as Canada

issues a $2.00 coin and begins phasing out its $2.00 bill: the Republicans'

<A HREF="http://edf.www.media.mit.edu/conttex.html">Contract With America</A> calls for replacing the dollar bill with a coin, but

efforts to this effect in Congress have failed. Estimates of savings to

taxpayers from such a substitution--the life-span of a coin is 20 times that of

a bill--range from $100 million to $400 million a year. Opponents include the

Clinton Administration, which cites public sentiment (three quarters of those

polled last year did not want the dollar bill eliminated, in part because coins

are bulkier); the U.S. Mint (which has a stash of the unpopular Susan B.

Anthony dollar coins, from 1979 and 1980, in its vaults); and the Sierra Club

and the Audubon Society, which object to the added strip-mining a dollar coin

would require.

<i>Manhattan was supposedly sold for $24 worth of trinkets. Where does that

figure come from?</i><p>





				<img src="./trinkets.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>





<i></i>The figure is specious on several counts. The only authentic record of

the sale appears in a 1626 letter by an official of the Dutch West India

Company, who writes of a vessel recently returned from New Netherland with news

that settlers there had made a trade: "they have bought the island Manhattes

from the wild men for the value of sixty guilders. . . ." When the

letter--itself only a secondhand report--was translated into English in the

1870s, 60 guilders was converted to $24 on the basis of nineteenth-century

exchange rates, and this figure has never been adjusted for inflation. Even a

corrected dollar amount would be largely meaningless, however, because the

Dutch paid not in cash or even in trinkets but in manufactured metal goods such

as knives and ax heads--implements that were of little worth to the Dutch but

of immeasurable value to Native Americans who were lacking the technology to

produce such tools themselves.

				<img src="./sugar.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>





This month <A HREF="http://envirolink.org/florida/florida.html">Florida</A> decides whether to try to buy a 32,000-acre sugar plantation

between Lake Okeechobee and <A HREF="http://www.gorp.com/gorp/resource/US_National_Park/fl_everg.HTM">Everglades National Park.</A> If the sale is concluded,

the land will be converted to marsh, thus bolstering the area's natural

water-storage and filtration capacity--a key to preserving the fragile

ecosystem of the Everglades. In addition, the decline in sugar production will

reduce the flow of pollutants into the park. The purchase is a major goal of

<A HREF="http://gurukul.ucc.american.edu/ted/EVER.HTML">Florida's Everglades Forever restoration project</A>; the federal government may

also get involved, by taxing sugar production nationwide to help fund the

purchase. Predictably, the sugar industry--which benefits from a controversial

price-support program and is widely blamed for much of the degradation of the

Everglades--opposes the sale and the tax proposal, citing a potential loss of

jobs on the plantation and the need to compete with heavily subsidized foreign

sugar companies.

Nervous flyers can perhaps take heart this month, as the Federal Aviation

Administration inaugurates a national electronic database for monitoring

air-transportation safety. The Safety Performance Analysis System (SPAS) will

help FAA inspectors quickly detect problems in particular aircraft and airlines

as well as industry-wide. SPAS can compare a given craft's performance with

that of similar-sized planes. It can also examine repair stations, training

programs, and personnel in all organizations under FAA surveillance. The system

was designed in collaboration with the Department of Defense, which hopes to

use it to evaluate its own planes. Also this month, a national toll-free

24-hour hot line to counsel victims of domestic violence is scheduled to begin

operation in Austin, Texas. The hot line is funded by a $1 million federal

grant authorized by the 1994 crime bill.

Some of the nation's museums will get a boost this month, as the Knight

Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts award the first grants from their

jointly run national Museum Loan Network, designed to facilitate the sharing of

museum collections. Some 15 to 20 grants, ranging from $5,000 to $30,000, will

be given this year to help institutions pay for various aspects of the

borrowing and lending process. The network is also planning to establish a

database that will provide all museums with information about objects available

for loan. The escalating costs of mounting exhibits have kept an increasing

number of objects from public view, a situation that the network is hoping to

help remedy: one prominent curator estimates that up to 90 percent of the

country's museum holdings currently languish in storage.

Agnes Repplier, writing in the February, 1921, issue of <i>The Atlantic

Monthly</i>: "There are, indeed, devout Christian communities which expend

their time, money, and energy in extinguishing in the breasts of other

Christians the faith which has sufficed and supported them. The methods of

these propagandists are more genial than were those of the Inquisition; but

their temerity is no less, and their animating principle is the same. They

proffer their competing set of dogmas with absolute assurance, forgetting that

man does not live by fractions of theology, but by the correspondence of his

nature with spiritual influences moulded through the centuries to meet his

needs. To counsel the doubtful is a Christian duty; but to create the doubts we

counsel is nowhere recommended. It savors too closely of omniscience."

It would cost a	lot, but it could be done, and would it not further understanding among men or	at least among transport contractors?<p>	<p>	<p>	Satire apart (though it is sometimes difficult, as a Roman poet said, not to	write satirically), what is it that makes the guardians of our artistic	inheritance so subject to whims and so eager for stunts? Perhaps it is unfair	to blame them too much, for they are driven into this attitude by public	pressure: the pressure of success and the menace of failure. Exhibitions	attract, museums repel. The museum has been denounced for so long as the morgue	of dead art, the vault for mummies, that a museum director can hardly be blamed	if he tries to shout it from the housetops that his own museum is alive, that	it moves with the times and responds like a kaleidoscope to any shake of	fashion.<p>	<p>	<p>	But even these hectic efforts to remove the faintest smell of mustiness and to	keep up with every new trick of display technique are, one suspects, of	comparatively little avail. Parties of schoolchildren and sightseeing tourists	will make the round of the galleries, but what of the citizens who own and	support the collection? We are all guilty here. We know the museum is there, we	are proud to think of its treasures, but it is precisely because we know or	hope that these will always be with us that we let the days slip by--and go to	exhibitions instead. For the exhibition puts the pistol at our heads; it is now	or never that we can see these works assembled at so much cost from all parts	of the globe, and so it has to be now. The museum may own better works, but	they can wait.<p>	<p>	<p>	Moreover, the exhibition has a social incentive that is quite out of reach of	the permanent collection. For the exhibition will always stand high on the list	of likely conversation topics at parties. We can turn to our dumb-looking	neighbor and ask with perfect propriety, "Have you been to the exhibition of	Japanese basketwork?" Even if she says no, we can tell her about it. But social	conventions normally discourage us from asking our fellow citizens whether they	have ever visited their own museum? Even less are we expected to describe the	content of one of its galleries, where, possibly, superior basketwork has been	displayed for many decades. And so the exhibition flourishes, first as a	prospective topic and then as a remembered one. The museum lingers in the	shadows, a place that reproaches us with its very presence and with its	countless showcases which we could and should see and enjoy if only we had the	leisure.<p>	<p>	<p>	What other solution can there be, then, but to transform museums into	exhibitions? To exploit the attraction and the menace of change? To invent	excuses for loans and for impermanent shows? To ask, in other words, "whatever	shall we do next?" because the question is raised by the public?<p>	<p>	<p>	And yet, I think, this drift toward sensationalism must end in disaster.	Physical disaster, possibly, for the transport and shuffle of frail and	precious objects are obviously fraught with danger; psychological disaster	certainly, for works of art should provide more than momentary stimulation. For	good or ill the museum is a resting-place, the treasure-house where the	heirlooms of the past which were cut adrift by the wars of princes and the	greed of collectors found a haven at last. It is restful for us, too, to know	that they are there, that we can seek them out and consult them whenever we	feel like it. Perhaps there are not that many people who desire this	reassurance. But they are the ones whose needs are genuine and should be	respected. It should be possible for them to visit their favorite painting,	statue, or vase for a few minutes without having to search and to learn that it	was removed to the stores or sent to Timbuktu to make room for some circulating	circus. Granted that a museum is, at best, an imperfect setting for a work of	art, it is at least a second home and not a wandering sideshow.<p>	<p>	<p>	Above all, of course, we must rally to protect the works of art that can still	be found where they grew, in the place and setting for which they were created.	How rewarding it is to make the pilgrimage to the little chapel of the cemetery	of Monterchi where Piero della Francesca's majestic Madonna del Parto has	looked down on the worshipers for five hundred years. How grateful we must be	to see Titian's Assumption of the Virgin again on the high altar of the Frari	in Venice for which it was painted and which therefore enhances its meaning and	its splendor.<p>	<p>	<p>	How wonderful it is that there still are the old churches and old palaces in	the towns of Europe, with their wall paintings and their monuments telling of a	mode of life so different from our own--narrow perhaps, and grim, but all the	more intense. If ever the old saying that the whole is more than the sum of its	parts had relevance, it is surely true of these products of a slow and	deliberate growth, with their layers of decoration and their sequence of	donations. Every chapel tells the story of generations: every villa proclaims	the aspirations of men, with their idiosyncrasies, their good luck, and their	follies. And yet even these survivals are threatened, and their number is	dwindling every day. In Italy the murals of the masters are increasingly being	detached from the walls on which they were painted and removed to museums There	may be no choice here. The clouds of fumes raised by the torrent of motor	traffic have begun to eat into the pigment. The frescoes will perish unless	they are removed to air-conditioned rooms. Already we have seen a fabulous show	of detached murals wisely displayed in the Florentine Belvedere far above the	dust and exhaust that fill the street of that once peaceful city. Soon,	perhaps, Giotto's frescoes may follow the Venus de Milo to Japan or the Pieta	to New York.<p>	<p>	<p>	Soon, perhaps, but not yet. So far this is only the nightmare of a worried art	lover. There are still old churches and splendid palaces and villas. And there	are still museums, treasure-houses to which we can return throughout a lifetime	to see old friends and discover new ones. And once we have made such friends we	almost cease to care whether they stand on sacking or on silk, whether we must	look for them in a crowded showcase or find them in a place of honor with a new	spotlight and a springing fountain. Indeed, some perverse souls may prefer the	crowded display because it shows more of the treasures that have been amassed	and offers us a greater opportunity to make our own discoveries.<p>	<p>	<p>	For, the decisive argument against all the techniques that play with works of	art as if they were objects of salesmanship is that there is no substitute for	the pleasures of discovery. Museums may look labyrinthine and uninviting to the	uninitiated, but to those who have discovered their worth they offer the	prospect of a lifetime of explorations. To those of us who have acquired this	taste for the permanent and inexhaustible, the exhibition offers mainly	frustration--here today and gone tomorrow.<p>	<p>	<p>	Needless to say, there are exhibitions which are worth the sacrifice. To see	the whole work of a Poussin or a Delacroix assembled in one spot we may gladly	put up with a sense of inadequacy. But for the rest let the museum return to	its proper function, which was and is to preserve, protect, and make accessible	the relics of the past which have unfortunately lost their original context.	There used to be a real meaning in the designations of conservator, curator,	and keeper. What alternative titles do those who betray this trust propose? The	Venus de Milo was not made for the Louvre. But it has come to reside in it and	it now belongs to Paris, no less than does the Mona Lisa, which the King of	France inherited from Leonardo himself.<p></blockquote><hr><pre></pre><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1964 by Ernst H.Gombrich.

Hollister ran into rough going after his	discharge and wound up in the penitentiary. He is now out on parole, but the	memory of his incarceration is a vivid one, particularly the strong-arm tactics	of the prisoners, not the guards, which he describes in the following article	and which are no doubt in large measure responsible for many prison	outbreaks.</i></font><p>	<p>		<p>	<font size=5>M</font><font size=3>aybe it is time, now that everyone else has had his say on the continuing	problem of prison riots, that a former convict should make some observations on	the subject. A lot of analyses of the problem have been made during the past	couple of years, and a lot of solutions proposed; but most of them have managed	to sound more like the product of laboratory experiments than the result of a	good close look into prison itself. And nowhere does this show up more plainly	than in the unanimity with which the analysts have placed the blame primarily	on external trigger factors--overcrowding, poor food, parole policies,	psychological pressures generally--while almost completely disregarding the	large and obvious part played, first, by what can loosely be called convict	nature and, second, by deep-rooted convict tradition.<p>	<p>	<p>	It seems to be a general assumption that a prison riot springs into existence	either directly, from just grievances, or indirectly, from the tensions	peculiar to prison life which make trifling grievances seem large and	insupportable. Normally, since rational people risk disaster in search of a	better future only when they feel that the present has become intolerable, this	would be a reasonable assumption. But who said convicts were rational people?<p>	<p>	<p>	There is plenty of evidence to show that they aren't--a determining percentage	of them, anyway--and no plan to tackle the problem of prison disorders is	likely to be of much practical value unless it takes this fact into account.	The first and most obvious evidence is simply one of definition. A person of	sound common sense, even if his moral standards should permit such	carryings-on, doesn't clean out the office safe--the combination of which is	known only to his employer and himself--and still report to work the next	morning. He doesn't boast of his thefts to pickup girls or other such doubtful	confidantes, or flash his stolen roll in public, or do any of the braggart,	exhibitionist, nonsensical things that are reported in the crime news of every	daily newspaper. This common inability of smalltime lawbreakers to conduct	their affairs in a manner consistent with their own best interests seems to	ensure that prisons will always be a collecting ground for men of erratic	nature with yawning gaps in their thinking machinery.<p>	<p>	<p>	This is not to quarrel with statistics which place the convict's intelligence	quotient nearly as high as that of his counterpart in free society; it is	merely to say that he lacks the particular quality of mind--call it	clearheadedness and plain common sense--which would let him think in an orderly	manner and arrive at sensible conclusions. Nor is it to say that all convicts,	or even most of them, are positively aberrant. It is only to say that the same	"determining percentage" of them are--and in prison this percentage need not be	large, although in a general, unclassified prison it is likely to be.<p>	<p>	<p>	For eight years I did time in just such a penitentiary, under administrations	representing opposite extremes of penological thought. This period produced a	400 per cent turnover in prison population; half a dozen work stoppages--one of	them an institution-wide six-day hunger strike; numerous sporadic disturbances	of shorter duration; at least two fires of incendiary origin; and one	full-blown riot, with all the attendant violence and destruction.<p>	<p>	<p>	For two of those years prison discipline was almost nonexistent. Never,	probably, were inmates of a general penitentiary granted a standing of greater	dignity and freedom as a matter of policy. Never did they have less cause for	bitterness and resentment. Never did they have more to gain by cooperating with	a truly bold and forward-looking prison program. And never was reason so	lightly overthrown and privileges so joyously abused.<p>	<p>	The details make pretty strident reading. In a single cell block, more than a	hundred window frames were glassless at one time--the panes having been kicked	out in protest against poor reception on the institution radio hookup or to	express some other passing dissatisfaction. Guards, especially "good" guards	with records of mildness and fair dealing, were given a miserably hard time;	and several guards, good and bad, were engaged in bare-knuckle combat by	convicts made brave with home-brewed pruno. Inmate goon-squads, self-appointed	and armed with heavy bunk chains, seized the opportunity to roam the tiers,	squaring accounts with individual inmate enemies.<p>	<p>	<p>	These conditions of limited chaos were the handiwork of a relatively small,	energetic band--perhaps no more than 10 per cent of the inmate body--encouraged	by the approval of the rest of the lunatic fringe and the neutrality of	practically everyone else. Disorder was clearly a minority action--or, more	exactly, a collection of individual actions that only superficially resembled	organized rebellion. Yet the most obvious characteristics here--total	irresponsibility, indifference to consequences, wanton destructiveness--are a	primary ingredient in most collective inmate actions, and they spring from	fundamental aspects of mass convict nature.<p>	<p>	<p>	<font size=4><b>2.</font></b> <font size=3><p>	<p>	If your first experience with prison revolt is of the slow-building, inevitable	sort growing out of general resentment and just indignation, it is easy to	assume that disorder can come no other way; that an uprising cannot mature	without whole-hearted main-line support. But many times a full-scale riot has	taken place when hardly a man participating is genuinely convinced that	violence--or rebellion of any sort--is either right or necessary<p>	<p>	<p>	Except under truly intolerable prison conditions, sensible prisoners oppose a	strike, and still more a riot, for they know that sooner or later rebellion is	almost sure to leave them worse off than before. Violence inevitably brings	restricted privileges, tightened discipline, an uprooting of the routines that	make for doing easy time. As indicative as anything of the "differentness" of	convicts as a social group, therefore, is the nature of the causes for which	they will unite in extreme action. I have known demands to be made, under	threat of strike (and strikes can easily explode into riots), that pepper be	provided for the mainline dining tables; that clean socks be delivered to the	cells daily; that unemployed prisoners be permitted to swim in the stream used	for generating the prison's power. A leader of one action vigorously insisted	that the terms of peace include that "they turn my brother out of the hole,"	where he was doing time for breaking prison rules and getting caught.<p>	<p>	<p>	The closer you look into the matter of prison insurrections, the more of this	demented sort of thing you find. One of the few really justified strikes to	happen during my time in prison was engineered to obtain the release of inmate	committee members who had wound up in the hole after pushing through a good	many reasonable and badly needed reforms. The strike lasted two days and was	successful. Besides granting the main point, the prison administration agreed	to the election of a permanent inmate council. As a member of a pro tem	committee, it fell to me to take the word to the regular committeemen and to	see them released. Four of them accepted the news enthusiastically. The other	two--the committee chairman one of them--refused to quit lockup because, they	complained, it had been their show and we, the main line, had "sold them out."	The proportion here--two to four--seems like a fair one to keep in mind.<p>	<p>	<p>	Later, near the end of a six-day hunger strike, I was named to establish some	sort of liaison among the council members scattered among the three cell	blocks. All of the demands that mattered had by that time been met by the	prison administration and state officials--including the one calling for the	hiring of a new warden. It was a clear cut victory for the main line, and it	was only too apparent that nothing but disaster would come of crowding our	luck. Yet in spite of all this, at least three of the eight-man council, backed	by a whopping percentage of the main line, were for holding out longer--either	in the hope of gaining further concessions or just for the joy of holding	out.<p>	<p>	<p>	With all this advance warning, the spectacle, two years later, of a "causeless"	riot shouldn't have been surprising. The strike began with a demand for better	food, which the administration granted almost at once. It has been conclusively	demonstrated, however, that nothing can so quickly arouse leaders of wildcat	uprisings to full belligerency as the simple granting of demands: the return of	peace always brings to an end their moment in the sun. It worked that way this	time. Nobody was able to advance any plausible grievances, although a score of	not very convincing pretexts were tossed about, to an accompaniment of soapbox	exhortations and flailing arms, during the hours that the project was gaining	momentum. There simply weren't any plausible grievances to be had. In spite of	this, when the administration made a show of force, something like twenty-four	hours after the affair began, the strike turned almost immediately into a riot.	The first building put to the torch was the laundry, containing a fair share of	the main-line wash. Then the canteen was broken into and plundered. Then the	storehouse for inmate recreation and athletic supplies went up in flames. Some	of the rioters attempted to fire the dining room, one floor beneath the prison	hospitals but were dissuaded by cooler heads.<p>	<p>	<p>	It is easy to say that such irrational behavior is an expression of	accumulated, perfectly normal resentment of captivity. But sensible people	don't lodge a protest by pulling their homes down about their ears. Yet upward	of a half dozen times a year, this phenomenon of self-flagellation is repeated	in the nation's prisons.<p>	<p>	<p>	Why is it that no dissenting voices are raised before the pot boils over? Why	is it that the great majority of prison uprisings appear, from beginning to	end, to be an expression of the popular will? It is here that convict tradition	comes into the picture.<p>	<p>	<p>	The troubles lies almost entirely in the fact that there is no loyal opposition	in prison: that opposition, especially to any form of rebellion against	authority, is usually taken as prima-facie evidence of disloyalty. And among	prisoners, nothing is quite so assiduously to be avoided as the suspicion of	selling out to the enemy. Convicts, contrary to the notion popular with	Hollywood producers and novelists, are not quite the hard-riding individualists	that their excursions into outlawry might indicate. Their outcast state has	made them all the hungrier for social approval, even if it must be the approval	of fellow outcasts. The rarest thing in prison is the convict who chooses to	stand against group opinion. Even nonparticipants and nonbelievers decline to	rise up and protest the din that disturbs their peace, or the disorders that	threaten their well-being or even their lives. They prefer to obey the prison	world's First Commandment and ''do their own time." In this light it isn't at	all surprising that an entire inmate body should give at least passive support	to a strike leader who demands that pepper be placed on the dining-room tables	or that his brother be released from legitimate punishment in the hole. There	is really nothing else for them to do.<p>	<p>	<p>	<font size=4><b>3.</font></b><p>	<p>	All this leads to some general conclusions that seem to have escaped most of	the people who are trying to find out how to cure the epidemic of prison	riots.<p>	<p>	<p>	1. Convicts, however many exceptions there may be, are generally not mature,	fully developed people; and it is about time for high-minded idealists to stop	assuming that they will respond to corrective techniques in the same way that	normal adults would. Nothing could be farther from the truth than the notion	that prisoners are a representative cross section of the human population, who,	through mischance or uncharacteristic impulse, happen to land in jail. For the	most part, notwithstanding any number of incidental virtues that may be found	among them, they are truncated personalities--a separate breed whose natural	habitat is prison and who find an outlet for all of their limited facilities in	prison surroundings. From a therapeutic view, the important thing is to find	and to concentrate all corrective efforts on the relatively small percentage	who are complete human beings capable of assuming the responsibilities of free	citizens.<p>	<p>	<p>	2. By all the tests that can be applied, it is perfectly clear that the	greatest threat to prison order always lies in the small group of violently	unstable men, usually at least mildly paranoid, which every prison holds. It is	equally clear that convicts of this sort respond to specific kinds of treatment	in a quite predictable way. They will respect strict discipline and not much	else. And with absolute dependability they will interpret kindliness or a	softening of discipline as a sign of weakness to be exploited. Obviously, then,	the first requirement of prison management is to curb this element--vigorously,	using whatever means are necessary.<p>	<p>	<p>	3. But in a general, all-purpose prison, this isn't as easy as it sounds. The	disciplinary standard of any prison has to be geared to the requirements	imposed by the most troublesome element in the total group--and one man's	discipline, after all, is another man's repression. It is obviously neither	just nor wise, from a morale or security view, to impose on tractable prisoners	the relatively severe disciplinary measures necessary to whittle the paranoiacs	down to size. It doesn't seem enough, then, merely to suppress the	style-setters of anarchy. As soon as they are identified they should be shipped	off, bag and baggage, delusions and pretensions, to a separate,	maximum-discipline institution. And if no such institution exists--as in the	case of all one-prison states--it should be provided.<p>	<p>	<p>	4. This would mean that the old technique of inmate classification would have	to be relied on--but with a difference. Maximum-discipline prisons have always	existed, but they are regarded as a special preserve for escape risks and "bad	men" who for security reasons need closer watching. It is a perfectly safe bet	that there are several prison wardens in the nation today who recognize	(perhaps belatedly) that it is less disastrous that an occasional convict	should escape, if it comes to that, than that his prison should go up in flames	at the hands of a flock of bobby-soxers. And the danger signs are easy to spot.	It is the convict who swaggers in his walk, who shoulders a guard out of his	path, who makes a theatrical production of his contempt for authority and not	the convict who gets caught with a pair of bar-spreaders in his mattress, who	is the real threat to prison security.<p>	<p>	<p>	If the experience of recent years means anything at all, it means that these	are at least some of the principles on which the answer to wildcat riots must	be based. Demonstrations can still be expected to occur, of course, as a	last-resort means of calling a really hopeless state of affairs to attention.<p>	<p>	<p>	Meanwhile it might as well be recognized that the simple fact of revolt doesn't	by a long shot indicate the presence of real grievances, and that an uprising	needn't have any element of good faith or good sense about it. Too often it	hasn't had. The goal of sensible convicts, after all, is to get out of prison,	not to run one.<p>	<p> </blockquote><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1955 by H.W.

N 1925, a decade before his <i>General Theory of Employment, Interest, and 

Money</i> revolutionized thinking about economic policy, <A 

HREF="http://william-king.www.drexel.edu/top/prin/txt/Intro/Keynes.html">John 

Maynard Keynes</A> wrote an essay titled "The Economic Consequences of Mr.  

Churchill." He took the then Chancellor of the Exchequer to task for having 

brought the pound back to the gold standard too soon after the First World 

War and at too high a value.  Keynes predicted dire economic consequences.  

He was right.  The British economy stagnated, resulting in years of 

unemployment above 10 percent even before the Great Depression.  Because 

Britain was still central to world trade, its deflation spread deflation 

around the globe.<p>

Seventy years later the world economy, now led by the United States, is on a

dangerously parallel path. In the 1990s received economic wisdom has

substituted for the gold standard deficit reduction as the central instrument,

with zero inflation as the central goal, of economic policy. <p>



The effects are disturbingly similar to those of the orthodoxy of the 1920s

before Keynes's <i>General Theory </i>suggested that deliberate government

deficits could be used to stimulate employment. In recent years the richest

nations in the world have suffered increasing unemployment (and in the United

States increasing inequality) and social unease even in good times, with worse

to come when the cycle turns down.<p>



Keynes contended that <A 

HREF="http://www.empirenet.com/~rdaeley/authors/churchill.html">Churchill</A> 

had erred because "lacking .  . .  instinctive judgement, he was deafened 

by the clamorous voices of conventional finance; and, most of all, because 

he was gravely misled by his experts." The same is true of Bill Clinton.  

In his first few months as President he surrendered the traditional liberal 

Democratic stress on expanding demand, leaving conventional finance in 

possession of the field.  This not only weakened the government's ability 

to increase the demand for labor but also made impossible more than nominal 

investment in programs to improve the adaptability of job seekers to 

available jobs.  One major reason for the President's defection was that 

his own experts in the ranks of academic economists and in his 

Administration had turned to pre-<i>General Theory</i> orthodoxy.  Therein 

lies an important part of the tale that climaxed but did not end in the 

1994 Republican congressional victory and the great budget battle of 

1995-1996.  A high point was the President's acceptance, in mid-July of 

last year, of the Republican goal of a balanced budget in seven years.  By 

then the only real issue that remained was the rate of federal withdrawal 

from support of the economy and of those left behind by prosperity.  <p>



With balance as the sole criterion for budgeting, and zero inflation as the

sole objective, what used to be called full employment has been forgotten, even

though the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978 still mandates it as a central national

goal. The problem is one of long-term change, not recession. Even the <i>low

</i>unemployment rates of the good times of the 1980s and 1990s almost match

the <i>highs</i> of the 1950s and 1960s. Unemployment of six to seven percent

was severe recession then; now when unemployment dips below six percent, storm

warnings go up: too low an unemployment rate might be inflationary.<p>



At the same time, inequality of earnings and income has been increasing among

wage and salary earners and among American families. The rich have been getting

much richer, the poor significantly poorer. And the future looks bleak to the

insecure middle class, whose fearful members are tempted to blame their ills on

those who are worse off than they are. Economic stimulus is not the cure for

all these problems, but lacking stronger economic growth than we have had, no

remedy is possible.<p>



When the business cycle turns down again, and unemployment rises from its

already high lows, the political and social effects may go beyond grumbling and

petty meanness to expanding extremism in many areas of American life.<br><br><br>

<B><font size=4>Clinton's Case</font></B>



</CENTER>



<font size=5>T</font>O say that the previously Keynesian economists in the 

Clinton Administration have been captured by conservative orthodoxy is not 

to say that they are wrong.  The Keynesian models used through the 1960s 

broke down under the shock of oil-price increases in the 1970s.  

Unemployment went to levels higher than had been seen since the Depression, 

but attempts to reduce it by fiscal stimulus caused inflation to accelerate 

to rates not seen since the aftermath of the Second World War.<p>

 

When the collapse of oil prices in the early 1980s made possible a return 

to both lower unemployment and lower inflation, the Reagan Administration 

tried "supply-side" economics.  The resulting deficits were so huge that 

the Federal Reserve had to raise already high interest rates to 

unprecedented levels to avoid overstimulation of the economy.  

Supply-siders had contended that cutting tax rates would raise tax 

revenues, but <A 

HREF="../../../election/connection/Budget/stockman.htm">David 

Stockman </A> Reagan's budget director, knew better.  He later admitted 

that he had deliberately used the deficits to paralyze government social 

spending and "dismantle" federal programs put in place since 1933.  <p>



Stockman's scheme worked. The Democratic economists of the Clinton

Administration contend that although the deficits are not the fault of the

Democrats, their huge presence must nonetheless dominate the Administration's

fiscal policies. <p>











Their line of argument: <p>



<UL>



<LI> Over the past several decades the increase in U.S. productivity has slowed.

<p>



<LI> Productivity is increased primarily by increasing capital investment, but

investment has been decreasing. <p>



<LI> A major reason for the shortfall in investment is that because deficits must

be financed by borrowing, they compete with private investment for borrowable

funds, thus raising interest rates and crowding out productive investment in

the private sector.

</UL>

<br><br><br>





<CENTER>



<B><font size=4>The Demand-Side Alternative</font></B>



</CENTER>











<font size=5>T</font>HOSE who advocate a return to stimulus counter:<p>



<UL>



<LI> The argument that productivity

increases have slowed ordinarily compares the decades before 1972 with the

decades thereafter. Increases since then have in fact been slower than those of

the 1950s and 1960s, but once the petroleum problems of the 1970s stopped

affecting the system, productivity began to increase significantly

more rapidly.<p>



<LI> The quantity of investment is only one factor in increasing productivity, and

not the strongest one. Technological change, including organizational change,

contributes virtually twice as much, and improving worker education almost as

much. And in any case, business investment in plant and equipment, as a

percentage of GDP, has in fact been relatively high since the end of the oil

shocks. <p>



<LI> The crucial issues have to do with the crowding out of private-sector

investment and with interest rates. In the world of classical economics, in

which involuntary unemployment is by definition impossible, the total

quantities of productive resources available at any time, including borrowable

funds, are fixed. Thus any funds used by government must be taken away from

private uses, and taking them raises interest rates for those wanting to borrow

for private investment. But in the Keynesian (and the real) world, if demand is

so slack as to make most investment expenditures seem risky, low interest rates

may have little effect. Attempts to use monetary policy in such circumstances

have been likened to pushing on a string.

</UL><p>



Economists never have arrived at a satisfactory theory for weighting the

various factors that affect investment. The cost of borrowable funds is

certainly one of them, but only one. Taxation may also have important effects

on investment incentives: if the returns from investment are increased by tax

reduction, investment will increase. That is the central point of supply-side

economics. It is a good point in the abstract, but the relative weight of the

tax effect remains open to debate. <p>



Perhaps the most important determinant of investment, however (so most

economists of the 1950s and 1960s held), is the demand for products produced by

new plant and equipment. If, for example, demand for automobiles is expected to

increase, Ford or Honda may invest in a new plant. Whether Honda will do it in

Honshu or in Ohio is a question that suggests that economic policies

must increasingly be considered on the international level. Regardless, market

demand remains a crucial factor in determining investment. And fiscal policy

contributes directly to market demand. If the economy is operating at less than

full employment, then increased government spending or tax reduction or both

can increase demand for goods and services and consequently increase investment

in capital goods to make products to supply the demand. <p>



Which economic policies will best increase productivity and growth thus remains

an issue much more open than is suggested by current orthodoxy. President

Clinton, Senator Bob Dole, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and

Vice-Chairman Alice Rivlin, point in one direction: balance the budget to

reduce competition for investable funds. Some very respectable economists but

few politicians, in the United States or elsewhere, point the other way:

increase investment by increasing demand. <br><br><br>





<CENTER>



<B><font size=4>The Fallacious Family<br>Analogy</font></B>



</CENTER>



<font size=5>T</font>HE whole story, however, like all policy stories, is 

primarily one of politics, not economics.  Deficit spending has been 

considered politically dishonorable for a long time -- before, during, and 

after the Keynesian heyday.  The reason is expressed in the observation 

that elected officials enjoy the benefits of spending on voters but abhor 

the penalties of imposing taxes -- and thus the political incentives that 

encourage irresponsible deficit spending must be controlled, perhaps even 

by a balanced-budget amendment.<p>



The popular analogy is to a spendthrift family borrowing to live beyond its

means. That analogy is dubious, for three reasons. <p>



First, even thrifty families borrow for long-term purposes, many of

which -- their children's education, for example -- may be expected to increase

future income. A substantial part of federal spending is similar: it is

investment to increase future national income. Indeed, more than half of the

states' constitutions require balanced operating budgets, but they separate out

capital budgets to allow borrowing for long-term investment projects. <p>



Second, some government functions fall outside the family metaphor: if federal

deficits can have major effects on employment and other crucial economic

indicators, then national requirements for growth and stability may supersede

the simple morality of balancing income and outgo. <p>



Third, few families go broke because family members are borrowing from one

another. Most federal borrowing is from citizens or institutions that are part

of the American family; less than a quarter of our national debt is owned by

foreigners. For that reason, although deficits burden our children with debt,

debt also provides a good many of our children with such assets as government

bonds, representing the ownership of that debt. The national debt is now about

two thirds of the GDP. At the end of the Second World War it was greater than

the GDP, but postwar prosperity worked the ratio down. What threatens our

children now is not the debt, most of which they will owe to themselves.

Rather, it is economic policy aimed at achieving slow growth at best, which

will severely constrain their chances of finding good jobs. <p>



Even if the analogy between federal and family budgets is a poor one, however,

controlling spending is a valid and politically compelling goal. Advocates of

fiscal stimulus need to dissociate themselves from any idea that all spending

is good. Any proposed program that questions the current exclusive emphasis on

budget balancing must equally insist on close examination of each government

expenditure. That should include porky public works, entitlements, both

individual and corporate welfare, and "tax expenditures" -- loopholes in personal

and corporate taxes that, for bad reasons or good (for example, low-income

housing), attempt to achieve the same purposes as appropriated expenditures.

The current budget battle shows how difficult it is to do this in the face of

entrenched interests. Both the Administration and the congressional Republicans

have made brazen exceptions for special interests, even as they exchange

rhetoric over budget-balancing purity. <br><br><br>





<CENTER>



<B><font size=4>Reopen the Debate</font></B>



</CENTER>



<font size=5>I</font>N any case, the political reality is that the drive 

toward a perpetually balanced budget is not going to be reversed anytime 

soon.  Even now, however, groundwork for a new direction can be laid.<p>





<UL>





<LI> <i>The debate should be reopened</i>. Economists and political liberals

should challenge the current acceptance of deficit busting as the sine qua non

of economic policy. <p>



<LI> <i>Concepts should be re-examined</i>. Even conservative economists who put

great emphasis on budget balancing agree that the annual balancing of nominal

budget accounts (which imperfectly reflect federal spending) regardless of

economic conditions makes no sense. A recession reduces tax revenues, but

reducing expenditures to match can turn the recession into a depression. That's

what Herbert Hoover tried. Economists should suggest an alternative, such as

the <i>structurally</i> balanced budget -- one that would be balanced if the

economy were performing well. In addition, the case needs to be made vigorously

for a separate capital budget for public investment financed by borrowing. <p>



<LI> <i>The debate should be internationalized</i>. Whatever the United States

tries to do with its own economy it probably can do. The American economy is

strong, and the United States is a large enough market that the country can put

its own economic policy into effect. The same could be true of the European

Union if it were able to act as an actual union. It is still a collection of

nations, however, with the economic power in Bonn and Frankfurt. If the Germans

were willing to relax their anti-inflation constraints, West European economic

policy could still turn the continent away from the instability exemplified by

the strikes that paralyzed France in December of last year. Some French

politicians and economists are beginning to propose movement in that direction,

but France cannot reverse course without Germany. And early this year, as

French unemployment moved to almost 12 percent and German to above 10, the

president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, was giving no ground. Speaking at

a worldwide economics conference in Switzerland, he said that the bank would

not alter its monetary policy for the purpose of lowering unemployment.

Meanwhile, on the other side of Eurasia, Japan's will to pull itself up by its

economic bootstraps remains unclear. Yet coordinated stimulus in all three

centers of the First World would be far more likely to succeed than individual

national or regional efforts.





</UL>

<p>



In the American political dialogue, going beyond the parroted slogans of a

balanced budget is unlikely until the November election. It may also be

unlikely afterward, no matter what the outcome of the election. If so, the

United States can probably continue on the current economic course, at least

for a while. Yes, inequality will increase and insecurity grow. But the economy

will also grow, and if the rising tide is no longer lifting all boats, not many

are being left in the mud.<p>



Sooner or later the tide will go out. The real and deep danger is that if the

economic cycle turns toward sharp recession, and if balanced-budget

deficit-bashing remains the order of the day, either by constitutional

amendment or by rigid budgetary enactment, then we could be back in 1932. <p>



History tested then-prevalent economic theories in the 1920s and 1930s, and

those theories failed their tests. The economic imbalances and orthodoxies of

the 1920s led to the Great Depression, and that in turn opened the door to

Nazism and to war. Economic theorists and, more important, economic

decision-makers ignore such experience at great peril to the world.

	<h4>Health &amp; Safety</h4>

	

	

	

	January <b>1</b>, standards requiring abortion training in

obstetrics-and-gynecology residency programs come into effect today. The

requirements--issued by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical

Education--are the first to mention abortion rather than simply "family

planning." There are alternatives: the ACGME will allow residents and

institutions opposed to abortion to learn and teach only the management of

abortion-related complications, provided that interested residents are allowed

to train elsewhere in the practice of abortion. Programs that refuse to adopt

the new standards could lose their accreditation. The proportion of OB-GYN

residency programs that routinely provide first-trimester abortion training

dropped to 12 percent in 1992--half of what it was in 1985. 

	

	<br clear=all>

	

	<h4>Demographics</h4>

	

				<img src="./passport.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>



	

	January begins the busy season for U.S. passport offices, and this year is

expected to be particularly active, for two reasons. First, a record number of

passports--those issued in 1985--expired last year. Second, the number of new

passports issued has been growing, in large part because of a surge in the

number of naturalization ceremonies. Officials estimate that 35 million U.S.

passports are currently in circulation, and well over 5 million are likely to

be issued or renewed this year. The government is introducing innovative

technology to meet the demand: soon all passports issued domestically will use

digitized photographs, a step that will also make it nearly impossible for

criminals to forge passports.

	

	<br clear=all>

	

	<h4>Food</h4>

	

				<img src="./sherry.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>



	

	January <b>1</b>, starting today the European Union grants vintners in the

Jerez region of southern Spain the exclusive right to call their wine "sherry."

The EU handed down this ruling in 1992 on the grounds that the term derives

from a place-name: "sherry" (originally "sherris") is a transliteration of

Seris, the Arabic name for the Andalusian town now known as Jerez de la

Frontera. Spanish sherry, a fortified white wine made mainly from Palomino Fino

grapes and aged in oak casks, is battling a prissy image and has suffered on

the world market in recent years. The new regulations should boost sales;

impostor sherries made from grape concentrates, such as British ones (which

have outsold Spanish sherries at Christmastime), will have to be renamed.

Enforcement of the law is likely to be difficult outside the EU: French

producers of genuine champagne spend more than $3 million each year to protect

their name but have been unable to prevent some American companies from calling

sparkling wines "champagne."

	

	<br clear=all>



	<h4>Government</h4>

	

	

				<img src="./capitol.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>



	

January <b>23</b>, the first item from the Republicans' Contract With America

to pass the House and Senate takes effect today. The Congressional

Accountability Act removes the exemption from 11 workplace laws (including the

Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,

and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993) which had applied to 23,000

congressional employees. The judiciary is now the only branch of the federal

government that is not covered by these laws. Also this month, a new

spouse-abuse law takes effect in California, replacing regulations that had

made it possible for first-time misdemeanor offenders to avoid a trial or a

guilty plea--and a criminal record--by successfully completing counseling. The

new law requires defendants either to stand trial or to admit guilt; those

convicted or pleading guilty will receive mandatory counseling that will not

clear their records.

	

	<br clear=all>

	

		

	<h4>Environment</h4>

	

				<img src="./eagle.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>



	

	January <b>3</b>, the U.S. Department of the Interior begins its annual

midwinter bald-eagle survey. Numbers should be up; the national bird's status

was upgraded from "endangered" to "threatened" last year. For two weeks bald

eagles will be counted in traditional wintering areas, which include the

Chesapeake Bay, the upper Mississippi, and the Columbia River watershed. In

danger of extinction a generation ago, bald eagles have made a remarkable

comeback, thanks in large part to the 1972 ban on DDTand the Endangered Species

Act of 1973. The number of nesting pairs has reached about 4,500 (not counting

those in Alaska, where bald eagles thrive), up from 417 only 30 years ago. Bald

eagles occupy a shrinking natural habitat, however: people, too, enjoy perching

at the water's edge. Naturalists note that the bird remains on the Endangered

Species List--"threatened" simply means that the risk of extinction is less

immediate.

	

	<br clear=all>

	

	<h4>The Skies</h4>

	

				<img src="./meteor.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>



	

	January <b>4</b>, the Quadrantid meteor shower, which is ordinarily a good

display, is somewhat obscured even at its peak tonight by the gibbous Moon.

<b>5</b>, Full Moon, also known this month as the Wolf Moon and--among the Oto

Sioux--the Little Young Bear Comes Down the Tree Moon. <b>18</b>, in the

predawn southeastern skies, the waning Moon passes close by Jupiter, which is

visible all month long in the early morning. <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>, the

crescent Moon lies close to Venus and Saturn in the early evening.

	

	<br clear=all>

	

	<h4>125 Years Ago</h4>

	

				<img src="./flag.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>



	

	Stuart P. Sherman, writing in the January, 1921, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>:

"Among builders of American civilization, many means are now discussed for

awakening national pride and attaching the affections of the people to the

state; conspicuous among them are, or were, Liberty Bonds, nationalization of

the railroads, and universal military service. Robert Burns and Sir Walter did

the work more simply and cheaply for Scotland. It has never been hard for the

native-born American to hold America 'first' in political affairs; but

musicians as such, painters as such, men of letters as such, cannot, without

straining the meaning of the word, hold her first till her national genius

expresses itself as adequately, as nobly, in music, painting, and literature,

as it has, on the whole, in the great political crises."

		hree years ago, in light of the end of the Cold War, the Clinton 
Administration undertook a "fundamental reassessment" of America's 
national-security requirements. But after six months of analysis 
Administration officials concluded that the defense of U.S. global 
interests still demanded military spending of more than $1.3 trillion over 
the following five years and the permanent commitment of more than 200,000 
U.S. soldiers in East Asia and Europe--in other words, a strategy 
remarkably similar to that which America pursued during the Cold War. 
Moreover, rather than relinquish America's costly and risky 
responsibilities by dissolving Cold War alliances, defense strategists now 
plan to expand NATO's responsibilities eastward. Those who call for a more 
modest plan argue that U.S. strategy seems to be extravagance born of 
paranoia, or of the defense establishment's anxiety to protect its budget. 
In fact, given the way the makers of U.S. foreign policy have defined 
American interests since the late 1940s, these plans are quite prudent. 
And that is the problem. <p>

If many Americans had been asked ten years ago why U.S.  troops were 
deployed in East Asia and Europe, they would have answered, To keep the 
Soviets out.  They may have wondered, however, why the United States 
persisted in its strategy long after Japan, South Korea, and Western Europe 
had become capable of defending themselves.  Now that the USSR itself has 
disappeared, why does Washington continue to insist that U.S.  "leadership" 
in East Asia and Europe is still indispensable?<P> Ask National Security 
Council staff members, think-tank analysts, or State Department policy 
planners about America's globe-girdling security commitments and they will 
deliver very different answers--ones that have not changed in forty-five 
years.  They will justify the Pax Americana by invoking <A HREF="http://ksgwww.harvard.edu/~ksgpress/christop.htm">"the imperative of 
continued U.S.  world leadership,"</A> the need to "shape a favorable 
international environment," "reassurance of allies," and the ongoing need 
for "stability" and "continuing engagement." Even during the Cold War the 
"Soviet threat" might not have been mentioned.<P> The question that all 
this justification ignores is What, exactly, is "leadership," and why has 
it been the mantra of foreign-policy cognoscenti for nearly fifty years?  
What have we been doing around the globe, and why?<P> Most Americans 
misunderstand their country's foreign policy.  It seems to operate only 
when "danger" looms--when Iraq invades Kuwait, when Russian "imperialism" 
threatens to resurface, when China rattles its sabers at Taiwan.  Even 
people who religiously read the newspapers fail to grasp that U.S.  foreign 
policy is far more than simply a series of responses to crises.<P> For 
instance, media coverage of recurring tensions on the Korean Peninsula has 
focused on speculation about North Korea's nuclear program and the prospect 
of a new Korean war.  But when foreign-policy officials and experts discuss 
the Korean crisis among themselves, they rapidly leave the Koreas behind to 
focus on the real players in the region: China and Japan.  As far as 
national-security experts are concerned, almost any immediate crisis is 
subsumed by a larger threat--in this case no less than East Asia's role in 
the potential collapse of the international economy that U.S.  power has 
sustained since the late 1940s.<P> It's now an axiom of the U.S.  
foreign-policy establishment that economic, technological, and demographic 
changes are making East Asia the world's most dynamic arena, a driving 
force--increasingly the dominant force--in the international economy.  The 
Pacific Century, we are told ad nauseam, has dawned.  This transformation 
also means a shift in the international distribution of political and 
military power.  In a typical evaluation of East Asia's strategic future 
the foreign-policy expert <A 
HREF="http://www.wws.princeton.edu/faculty/friedberg.html">Aaron 
Friedberg</A> states darkly in the journal <I>International Security</I>, 
<P><blockquote> In the long run, it is Asia [rather than Europe] that seems 
far more likely to be the cockpit of great power conflict.  The half 
millennium during which Europe was the world's primary generator of war (as 
well as of wealth and knowledge) is coming to a close.  But, for better and 
for worse, Europe's past could be Asia's future.</blockquote><P> 
Friedberg's assertion nicely illustrates the ambivalence with which the 
U.S.  national-security community views East Asia's future.  He both 
prophesies an exhilarating Pacific Century and warns the West that the East 
may once again be up to no good.  <P> East Asia has never been a terribly 
successful field for American diplomacy.  There are undoubtedly many 
reasons for this, and surely that shortcoming for which the United States 
is continually indicted--cultural and historical myopia--has contributed 
enormously to its failures in the region.  Americans have always seen East 
Asia not for what it is but for what it can do to them or for them: the 
region is either danger or opportunity--either a new "ground war in Asia" 
or a new China market.  American understanding of Japan, for instance, is, 
in the words of the historian <A 
HREF="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~ksa/kascon/speakers/bc.htm">Bruce 
Cumings,</A> caught within the conflicting views of Japan as "miracle and 
menace, docile and aggressive, fragile blossom and Tokyo Rose." As 
Friedberg's analysis attests, the U.S.  foreign-policy community worries 
that the fragile blossom may again bloom into a Tokyo Rose.  <P> Pacific 
Century rhetoric usually describes the new era in a "post&#173;Cold War" 
context.  This is misleading, because it starts at the wrong place.  First, 
the shift of economic activity has not been sudden.  Even if East Asia rose 
in the American consciousness just as the Soviet Union receded, to define 
the economic and geopolitical transformation of East Asia as a 
post&#173;Cold War phenomenon Americanizes and trivializes a development in 
international (not American) politics of far greater impact than the Cold 
War itself.  Although Vietnam, China, and North Korea were for forty years 
able to contain America's Cold War ambition to "roll back" communism, they 
are proving utterly unable to contain the juggernaut of East Asia's 
capitalist political economy.  Most important, to imply that the end of the 
Cold War is of primary significance to U.S.  policy in East Asia is to 
wrench that policy out of its most important context and to distort its 
underlying aims and challenges.<P> What we think of as the Cold War was 
merely instrumental in America's larger "Cold War" strategy.  In "scaring 
hell out of the American people," as Senator Arthur Vandenberg said in 
1947, the U.S.-Soviet rivalry helped to secure domestic support for 
Washington's ambition to create a U.S.-dominated world order.  That same 
year one of Vandenberg's colleagues, <A HREF="../../../election/connection/
foreign/asiso.htm">the fervently anti-Communist Senator 
Robert Taft, expressed a strong suspicion that the supposed dangers to the 
nation from the USSR failed to explain America's new foreign policy.</a>  He 
complained that he was "more than a bit tired of having the Russian menace 
invoked as a reason for doing any--and every--thing that might or might not 
be desirable or necessary on its own merits." The former Secretary of State 
Dean Acheson put things in proper perspective: describing how Washington 
overcame domestic opposition to its internationalist policies in 1950, he 
recalled in 1954 that at that critical moment the crisis in Korea "came 
along and saved us."<P>


<br> <CENTER><b>Making the World <br> Safe for 
Capitalism</b><P> </CENTER> 

<font size=5> A</font> FUNDAMENTAL aim of 
America's Cold War strategy was to create and maintain what the former 
Secretary of State James Baker has called "a global liberal economic 
regime"--a capitalist world order. After the Second World War, American 
statesmen believed that the United States, standing alone and strong in a 
world of weary nations, had a remarkable opportunity, as Acheson said, to 
"grab hold of history and make it conform." American statesmen seized that 
opportunity by creating a complex strategy to reify Adam Smith's dream.  
Washington envisioned a world economy in which trade and capital would flow 
across national boundaries in response to the laws of comparative advantage 
and supply and demand--an economy in which production and finance would be 
integrated on a global scale.  The constricted national markets that were 
emerging in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War in Europe and 
East Asia would be combined, eliminating the inefficiencies of statism and 
self-sufficiency.  Large-scale regional economies would in turn be 
integrated into an interdependent world economy.  U.S.  policymakers knew 
that building this multinational capitalist community required the United 
States to provide Western Europe and Japan with enormous amounts of 
economic aid (through such schemes as the <A 
HREF="http://tesuque.cs.sandia.gov/~bbooth/docs/marshallplan.html">Marshall 
Plan,</A> for Europe, and the Dodge Plan, its equivalent for Japan), so 
that those areas would not retreat into closed economies.  They also knew 
that an open world economy demanded an even more ambitious American 
project: transforming international relations.<P> The greatest danger to 
U.S.  democracy and prosperity came, they believed, not from the Soviet 
Union but from Germany and Japan, whose potential strength amounted to a 
sort of Catch-22.  Without a flourishing international economy, Under 
Secretary of State Will Clayton warned in 1947, "our democratic free 
enterprise system" could not function.  As late as 1960 exports accounted 
for only 3.8 percent and imports for 4.8 percent of GDP.  The health of the 
international economy, in this disputable view, depended on Germany's and 
Japan's economic revitalization.  Germany, if its economy was resurrected, 
would once again be Europe's most efficient producer and most avid 
consumer.  Its very economic potential, however, made Germany a threat to 
the other Western European states, which, as the future Secretary of State 
John Foster Dulles explained to a closed Senate panel in 1949, were "afraid 
to bring that strong, powerful, highly concentrated group of people into 
unity with them." Similarly, as Dulles, Acheson, and other policymakers 
understood, a strong Japan was both necessary for a prosperous 
international order and intolerable to its neighbors.  The problem lay in 
the inherent contradiction between capitalism and international 
politics.<P> Capitalist economies prosper most when labor, technology, and 
capital are fluid, so that they are driven toward international integration 
and interdependence.  But whereas all states benefit absolutely in an open 
international economy, some states benefit more than others.  In the normal 
course of world politics, in which states are driven to compete for their 
security, the relative distribution of power is a country's principal 
concern, discouraging economic interdependence.  Thus 250 years ago the 
philosopher <A HREF="http://unix1.utm.edu/departments/phil/hume.html">David Hume</A> bemoaned the lack of economic cooperation among 
countries, blaming the "narrow malignity and envy of nations, which can 
never bear to see their neighbors thriving, but continually repine at any 
new efforts towards industry made by any other nation." In its efforts to 
ensure the distribution of power in its favor and at the expense of actual 
or potential rivals, a state will "nationalize"--that is, pursue autarkic 
policies, practicing capitalism only within its borders or among countries 
in a trading bloc.  This circumscribes both production factors and markets, 
and thereby fragments an international economy.  <P> A truly global economy 
is probably impossible to achieve.  In fact, as the Princeton political 
economist <A HREF="http://www.nbr.org/pub/analysis/vol2no1.htm">Robert Gilpin</A> has said, "what today we call international 
economic interdependence runs so counter to the great bulk of human 
experience that only extraordinary changes and novel circumstances could 
have led to its innovation and triumph over other means of economic 
exchange." Historically, to secure international capitalism a dominant 
power must guarantee the security of other states, so that they need not 
pursue autarkic policies or form trading blocs to improve their relative 
positions.  This suspension of international politics through hegemony has 
been the fundamental aim of U.S.  foreign policy since the 1940s.  The real 
story of that policy is not the thwarting of and triumph over the Soviet 
threat but the effort to impose an ambitious economic vision on a 
recalcitrant world.<P><br> <CENTER><B>Nurturing--and Constraining--<BR> the 
Fragile Blossom</b><P> </CENTER> <font size=5> T</font>HE overriding 
objective of U.S.  postwar policy toward East Asia was restoring Japanese 
economic power.  To be sure, this would help to immunize the region against 
Communist expansion; but Acheson and the other creators of the American 
Century thought the goal itself vital, regardless of the Soviet threat.  As 
the historians William Borden, Bruce Cumings, Ronald McGlothlen, and 
Michael Schaller have argued, in attempting to create a global economic 
system Washington pursued a course designed in essence to restore the 
Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere--imperial Japan's regional economy, 
which the United States had just destroyed in the Second World War.  If 
Japan was to help fuel the world economy, it would have to be, in Acheson's 
words, "the workshop of Asia." American postwar planners viewed the 
political economy that had developed in Northeast Asia from about 1900 to 
1945 as the region's natural economy--a tripartite system in which Japan, 
given access to continental markets and raw materials, formed the 
industrial core and its neighbors formed the economic semi-periphery and 
periphery.  As Japan advanced in the product cycle, climbing up the 
technological ladder, it spun off its low-technology and low-wage 
industries to its neighbors.  <P> In the late 1940s and the 1950s the 
United States essentially restored this system; but the machine could not 
run by itself.  Washington had to ensure that Japan's neighbors would feel 
secure politically in the regional hierarchy atop which Japan stood.  
Washington also had to ensure that the hierarchy did not develop--as it had 
in the past--into a Japanese-led closed economic bloc, which would threaten 
the world economy. <A HREF="http://www.worldmedia.com/archive/year/year-c02-s02.html">NSC 48,</A> the National Security Council's 1949 blueprint 
for America's Cold War strategy in East Asia, summed up the chief 
difficulty facing Washington's economic goals in the region--and around the 
globe.  Starting with the premise that "the economic life of the modern 
world is geared to expansion," requiring "the establishment of conditions 
favorable to the export of technology and capital and to a liberal trade 
policy throughout the world," NSC 48's authors went on to warn that "the 
complexity of international trade makes it well to bear in mind that such 
ephemeral matters as national pride and ambition can inhibit or prevent the 
necessary degree of international cooperation, or the development of a 
favorable atmosphere and conditions to promote economic expansion." <P> The 
distinguished historian and diplomat George Kennan, then the head of the 
State Department's policy-planning staff, saw only one solution to what he 
described as the "terrible dilemma" confronting U.S.  ambitions in East 
Asia.  Forty-seven years later Washington continues to pursue that 
course.<P><blockquote> You have the terrific problem of how then the 
Japanese are going to get along unless they reopen some sort of Empire 
toward the South.  Clearly we have got .  .  .  to achieve opening up of 
trade possibilities, commercial possibilities for Japan on a scale very far 
greater than anything Japan knew before.  It is a formidable task.  On the 
other hand, it seems to me absolutely inevitable that we must keep 
completely the maritime and air controls as a means .  .  .  of keeping 
control of the situation with respect to [the] Japanese in all 
eventualities.  .  .  .  [It is] all the more imperative that we retain the 
ability to control their situation by controlling the overseas sources of 
supply and the naval power and air power without which [Japan] cannot 
become again aggressive.  .  .  .<P> If we really in the Western world 
could work out controls, I suppose, adept enough and foolproof enough and 
cleverly enough exercised really to have power over what Japan imports in 
the way of oil and such other things as she has got to get from overseas, 
we would have veto power on what she does need in the military and 
industrial field.</blockquote><P> By providing for Japan's security and by 
enmeshing its foreign and military policies in a U.S.-controlled alliance, 
Americans have contained their erstwhile enemy, preventing their "partner" 
from embarking upon independent--and, so the thinking goes, 
dangerous--political and military policies.  <A HREF="http://www2.gol.com/users/johnrach/Chap2-1.html">By restraining its powerful 
ally,</A> Washington has, to use a euphemism favored in policymaking circles, 
"reassured" Japan's neighbors and stabilized relations among the states of 
East Asia.  The United States played the decisive role in promoting Tokyo's 
integration with its former colonies in Japan-centered regional trade 
networks that have been the foundation of East Asia's economic "miracle." 
South Korea and Taiwan, for example, overcame their fear and resentment of 
Japan and opened their doors to Japanese investment and trade.  <P> In a 
series of revealing interviews published in 1970 the former undersecretary 
of state Eugene Rostow was pressed to explain the motivations underlying 
U.S.  foreign policy generally and U.S.  policy toward Vietnam 
specifically.  In doing so he betrayed the lingering and profound distrust 
that U.S.  policymakers feel toward any powerful state that could play a 
role in world politics more independent than the one the United States has 
assigned to it.  At a time when America was involved in Southeast Asia 
ostensibly to draw a line against international communism, Rostow admitted, 
"I think the major concern--at least my major concern--in this miserable 
affair is the long-range impact a [U.S.] withdrawal would have on Japanese 
policy." He explained, "After the Japanese lost the war they reached 
certain conclusions, the principal one being that it was infinitely better 
to cooperate with the United States than to follow a hostile, militaristic 
line.  Now, it's greatly to our interest to have that judgment proved 
correct." If the United States abruptly pulled out of Vietnam, Rostow went 
on, "I think the Japanese will draw certain conclusions.  And I think their 
policy will take on a much more nationalistic cast.  .  .  .  I think the 
first thing that would happen would be that they wouldn't ratify the 
nuclear-non-proliferation treaty.  They would feel compelled to become a 
nuclear power." This would endanger the imperative that America preserve "a 
world of wide horizons in which we can move around and trade and travel on 
a large scale."<P><br> <CENTER><b>America as<BR> "Adult Supervisor"</b><P> 
</CENTER> <font size=5>A</font>MERICA'S Cold War policy is best understood 
not by its communism-containing words but by its ally-containing deeds.  
Washington committed itself to building and maintaining an international 
economic and political order based on what officials at the time termed a 
U.S.  "preponderance of power." By banishing power politics and nationalist 
rivalries, America's Cold War alliances in East Asia and Europe in effect 
protected the states of those regions from themselves.  <P> The United 
States has not subjugated colonies but, like Great Britain in the 
nineteenth century, has built and benefited economically from a stable 
international political order.  In this way Lenin was right: imperialism 
is, or allows for, "the highest stage of capitalism"--an open economy among 
the industrialized nations.<P> By building this global economy the United 
States has realized what Lenin called "[the German socialist Karl] 
Kautsky's silly little fable about ultraimperialism." In the celebrated 
debate between Lenin and Kautsky, Lenin held that any international 
capitalist order was inherently temporary, since the political order among 
competing states would shift over time.  Whereas Lenin argued that 
international capitalism thus could not transcend the Hobbesian reality of 
international politics, Kautsky maintained that capitalists were much too 
rational to destroy themselves in internecine conflicts.  An international 
class of enlightened capitalists, recognizing that international political 
and military competition would upset the orderly processes of world finance 
and trade, would instead seek peace, free trade, and the cooperative 
development of backward areas.<P> But Lenin and Kautsky were talking past 
each other, since Kautsky believed that the common interest of what he 
called the "inter-capitalist class" determined international relations, 
whereas in Lenin's analysis international relations were founded not in 
social classes but in competition among states.  Lenin argued that there 
was an irreconcilable contradiction between capitalism and the 
international system; Kautsky didn't recognize the division in the first 
place.<P> America's foreign policy has been based on a hybrid of Lenin's 
and Kautsky's analyses.  It has aimed at the unified, liberalized 
international capitalist community Kautsky envisioned.  But the global role 
that the United States has undertaken to sustain that community is 
determined by a worldview very close to Lenin's.  To Washington, Baker's 
"global liberal economic regime" cannot be maintained simply by an 
internationalized economic elite's desire for it to exist; it can be 
maintained only by American power.  Thus, in explaining its global strategy 
in 1993, in its "post&#173;Cold War" defense strategy, the Pentagon defined 
the creation of "a prosperous, largely democratic, market-oriented zone of 
peace and prosperity that encompasses more than two-thirds of the world's 
economy" as "perhaps our nation's most significant achievement since the 
Second World War"--not the victory over Moscow.  And it declared that this 
global capitalist order required the "stability" that only American 
"leadership" could provide.  Ultimately, of course, U.S.  policymakers and 
Lenin diverge.  Although Lenin recognized that any given international 
political order was by its nature impermanent, America's foreign-policy 
strategists have hoped to keep the reality of international politics 
permanently at bay.<P> Although the Cold War has ended, what National 
Security Advisor Anthony Lake calls the "imperative of continued U.S.  
world leadership"--as exercised, for instance, in America's dominance of 
its alliances in East Asia and of NATO--remains necessary to maintain a 
global economy.  The now-infamous draft of the Pentagon's defense plan, or 
the Defense Planning Guidance, which was leaked to <I>The New York 
Times</I> in 1992, gave the public an unprecedented glimpse of the thinking 
that informs Washington's security strategy, merely stating in somewhat 
undiplomatic language the logic behind America's Cold War strategy.  The 
United States, it argued, must continue to dominate the international 
system and thus "discourage" the "advanced industrial nations from 
challenging our leadership or .  .  .  even aspiring to a larger regional 
or global role." To accomplish this, America must do nothing less than 
"retain the pre-eminent responsibility for addressing .  .  .  those wrongs 
which threaten not only our interests, but those of our allies or friends, 
or which could seriously unsettle international relations." <P> The United 
States, in other words, must provide what one of the Planning Guidance's 
authors termed "adult supervision." It must not only dominate regions 
composed of wealthy and technologically sophisticated states but also take 
care of such nuisances as Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic, and North 
Korea's dictator Kim Jong Il, to protect the interests of virtually all 
potential great powers so that they need not acquire the capability to 
protect themselves--that is, so that those powers need not act like great 
powers.  Thus, for instance, Washington must protect Germany's and Japan's 
access to Persian Gulf oil, because if these countries were to protect 
their own interests in the Gulf, they would develop military forces capable 
of global "power projection." No wonder the United States must spend more 
on its "national security"than the rest of the world's countries combined.  
This post&#173;Cold War strategy reflects what the historian Melvyn Leffler 
defined as an imperative of America's Cold War national-security policy: 
that "neither an integrated Europe nor a united Germany nor an independent 
Japan must be permitted to emerge as a third force."<P> Only in this 
context can Washington's concerns regarding current developments in East 
Asia be properly understood.  For instance, in 1993 Alberto Coll, then a 
deputy assistant secretary of defense, clarified U.S.  aims in East Asia.  
"In the future," Coll declared in the <I>Washington Quarterly</I>, <P> the 
stability of the Pacific Basin and a strong US-Japanese relationship will 
be more important to the United States than ever before.  The US economy 
needs the vast markets of the Pacific Rim, and it benefits enormously from 
Japanese investment capital and technology and the impetus toward greater 
productivity provided by Japanese competition.  <P> All these benefits 
would be lost, according to Coll, if the "traditional rivalries among Asian 
powers .  .  .  unravel into unrestrained military competition, conflict 
and aggression." In the same vein the author of the Clinton 
Administration's security strategy for East Asia, Joseph Nye, then the 
assistant secretary of defense, asserted last year that the U.S.  military 
protectorate is "the basis for stability and prosperity in the region"; if 
the United States were to forsake its "leadership role" in East Asia, "the 
stable expectations of entrepreneurs and investors [would] be subverted." 
Although the United States committed forces to Japan ostensibly to protect 
it from the Soviets, and to South Korea to protect it from the North, in 
1993 the deputy defense secretary, William Perry (now the Secretary of 
Defense), declared that America would continue to reassure and stabilize 
East Asia by maintaining troops "permanently" in Japan and even in a future 
unified Korea.  <P><br> <CENTER><b>The Domino<br> Theory Revived</b><P> 
</CENTER> <font size=5>T</font>O Washington, East Asia is still composed of 
dominoes ready to fall.  "Renationalization," a term used by the 
cognoscenti to mean the resumption of international politics, could start 
virtually anywhere and spread rapidly.  In one of Aaron Friedberg's many 
nightmare scenarios one can almost hear the click of the falling dominoes: 
<P><blockquote> The nuclearization of Korea (North, South, or whether 
through reunification or competitive arms programs both together) could 
lead to a similar development in Japan, which might cause China to 
accelerate and expand its nuclear programs, which could then have an impact 
on the defense policies of Taiwan, India (and through it, Pakistan) and 
Russia (which would also be affected by events in Japan and Korea).  .  .  
.  similar shock waves could also travel through the system in different 
directions (for example, from India to China to Japan to 
Korea).</blockquote><P> Friedberg and other national-security analysts 
paint a similarly gloomy picture in Southeast Asia if, for example, Japan 
should undertake a military buildup in response to Korean reunification.  
Japan's reaction would alarm China--the emerging colossus, which U.S.  
defense planners now regard as the most serious potential long-term threat 
to America's global position.  China would speed up the development of its 
"power projection" forces.  This would alarm Korea, Taiwan, and Japan--and 
also Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam.  Their defensive response 
would further alarm China.  <P> Such developments, from Washington's 
perspective, would have one of two results, either of which would shatter 
the global economy: international anarchy, or regional dominance by China 
or Japan, which policymakers believe would lead inevitably to a regional 
trading bloc.  Arguing in 1992 for the maintenance of America's leadership 
of its Cold War alliances, a high-ranking Pentagon official asked, "If we 
pull out, who knows what nervousness will result?" The problem, of course, 
is that America can never know.  According to this logic, it must always 
stay.  <P> To the United States, the best change in East Asia is no change 
at all, because any alteration in the status quo could start the dominoes 
falling.  And if there is to be change, Washington--not Tokyo or 
Beijing--must manage it.  To permit otherwise would send a dangerous signal 
about America's diminishing ability to regulate, calibrate, and manipulate 
international politics in East Asia.  Of course, Washington appreciates 
that change is inevitable, and its frustration comes from being unable to 
square the circle--to manage an increasingly unmanageable world.<P> 
Although the United States remains committed to preserving the Pax 
Americana in East Asia, the states in the region see U.S.  influence 
inexorably declining, and they are planning accordingly.  South Korea, for 
example, is reorienting its military away from an emphasis on the threat 
from the North and toward projecting power against a future threat from 
Japan by means of naval and air forces, submarines, spy planes, and 
satellites.  The problem is that in prudently preparing for similar 
eventualities the East Asian states may indeed, as Washington fears, 
precipitate renationalization.<P> At a loss for what to do, U.S.  
policymakers propose two contradictory solutions.  On the assumption that 
democracies are inherently peaceful toward one another, one solution goes, 
the United States should tranquilize East Asia by democratizing it.  At the 
same time, the second solution has it, because only American dominance can 
ensure stability in the region (as in Europe), the United States should 
maintain its hegemony indefinitely.  Leaving aside the question of whether 
either goal can be achieved, it should be clear that proposing these 
solutions is as inconsistent as simultaneously asserting, as do most in the 
U.S.  national-security community, that although democracies pose no danger 
to other democracies, America must continue to contain Germany and 
Japan.<P> The hope and fear with which policymakers view economic change in 
East Asia illustrates the contradictory convictions that animate U.S.  
policy.  Washington both heralds the economic dynamism of the Pacific Rim, 
hoping it will bring democracy and peace and worldwide economic growth, and 
dreads the Asian miracle.  It knows that just as economic change engenders 
a shift in political and military power, so a particular economic order is 
jeopardized as the foundation upon which it rests--U.S.  hegemony--weakens.  
In the oxymoronic vocabulary of U.S.  diplomacy, strong "partners" are 
economically welcome and indeed necessary, but U.S.  "leadership" is 
indispensable.  Zbigniew Brzezinski, who developed the idea of a trilateral 
division of responsibility among the United States, Japan, and Europe, 
calls for Washington to develop "a more cooperative partnership" with Tokyo 
even as he asserts that America must continue to control Japan militarily.  
<P><br> <CENTER><b>Losing Ground</b> </CENTER><p> <font size=5>T</font>HERE 
is something at once poignant and obtuse in James Baker's comment that 
because President Clinton's foreign policy lacks consistency and firmness, 
"for the first time since the Second World War, Japan is not delivering an 
automatic vote for the US position." Sticking his head in the sand, the 
former Secretary of State claimed that such problems could be obviated "as 
long as America leads.  .  .  .  We have to lead." Japan's actions are 
certainly related to a decline in U.S.  leadership, but that decline is not 
the fault of what Baker would characterize as Clinton's weak foreign 
policy.  No matter who is in charge of U.S.  foreign policy, America is 
less and less able to lead.  Baker seems to have forgotten that America's 
leadership in the Gulf War was possible only because its allies agreed to 
pick up the tab.  Given such leadership, it is no surprise that 
once-subservient "partners" are increasingly going their own way.  
Preponderance cannot simply be asserted; it must reflect a position based 
on power.  When that position shifts enough, 
preponderance--"leadership"--is lost.  <P> Lenin argued seventy-eight years 
ago that international capitalism would be economically successful but, by 
growing in a world of competitive states, would plant the seeds of its own 
destruction.  Ironically, the worldwide economic system that the United 
States has fostered has itself largely determined America's relative 
decline even as it has contributed to the country's economic growth.  
Through trade, foreign investment, and the spread of technology and 
managerial expertise, economic power has diffused from the United States to 
new centers of growth, thus undermining American hegemony and ultimately 
jeopardizing the world economy.  <P> Nearly everyone applauds today's 
complex web of global trade, production, and finance as the highest stage 
of capitalism.  But international capitalism may be approaching a crisis 
just as it is reaching its fullest flower.  A genuinely interdependent 
world market is extraordinarily fragile.  The emergent high-technology 
industries, for instance, are the most powerful engines of world economic 
growth, but they require a level of specialization and a breadth of markets 
that are possible only in an integrated global economy.  As U.S.  hegemony 
continues to weaken, renationalized foreign and economic policies among the 
industrialized powers could fragment that economy.  <P> The future of a 
foreign policy designed to strengthen what the United States must contain 
and, at the same time, to maintain an economic order that weakens the very 
foundation of that order seems evident: it will collapse under the weight 
of its own contradictions.  The United States remains caught in the dilemma 
Kennan discerned more than forty years ago: "To what end 'security'?  For 
the continuation of our economic expansion?  But our economic expansion .  
.  .  cannot proceed much further without .  .  .  creating new problems of 
national security much more rapidly than we can ever hope to solve them." 
To escape this dilemma, Americans will have to understand the foreign 
policy that is conducted in their name and re-examine the requirements for 
their own security and prosperity.  </blockquote>

<font size=5>T</font>HE forts of folly we have in mind are those represented

by supply-side economics and the unprecedented structural budget deficit that

resulted from, to quote the former senator Howard H. Baker, a Republican, that

"riverboat gamble" with the economy. The effects of this largest peacetime

deficit in America's history are still being debated, but there is general

agreement on its two main causes: Ronald Reagan's tax cuts and his defense

buildup. Throughout the 1980s <i>The Atlantic </i>examined the evidence for and

against each of these policies. In a series of articles, beginning with William

Greider's 1981 <A HREF="../../../atlweb/flashbks/classics/stockman.htm">"The

Education of David Stockman,"</A> the magazine found that tax cuts were stimulating consumption at the expense of saving and investment, and

worsening social inequality at a time when the international economy was moving

in the same baneful direction. We judged the defense buildup, which doubled

Pentagon spending, to be a reckless gamble to break the Soviet Union at the risk

of breaking the U.S. budget. The Soviet Union was broken, though just how much

the buildup contributed we leave to the historians. But, coupled with the tax

cuts, the buildup did indeed break the budget.<p>



The point of this look back at the past fifteen years? When the deficit is at

last brought under control, and the budget at last balanced, as President Bill

Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich now both pledge will happen--as this fort of

folly falls, in 2002 or 2005--Americans of that more solvent future will find

<i>The Atlantic</i>'s body by the wall. On the deficit we have fought the good

fight.<p>



That gives us standing to complain about Clinton's embrace of Gingrich's drive to

balance the budget. We approve the melody but not the lyrics. To repeat, the

deficit had two causes: tax cuts, directed chiefly at the most affluent

Americans, and the defense buildup. Yet neither tax increases nor defense cuts

figure in the Clinton deficit-reduction scenario. Absent tax increases to help

balance the budget, Clinton will almost certainly have to make socially

irresponsible cuts in the safety net for the poor and the health-security system

for the elderly. Absent the reorientation of U.S. defense strategy that was made

possible by the end of the Cold War, Clinton will be unable to address the second

of what in the 1992 campaign he termed "twin deficits."<p>



This is the "investment deficit." The phrase refers to the investments in

physical infrastructure and human capital that were not made in the 1980s because

the tax cuts and the defense buildup did not leave sufficient resources and

because Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush did not believe government

should make them. These forgone domestic investments are to tomorrow's economy

what the interstate highway system and the GI Bill were to today's--the necessary





conditions of future prosperity. While America went into deficit to give tax cuts

to the affluent and to win the Cold War, its trading partners were going into

deficit to make these kinds of domestic investments. Yet, through NATO and

through the Far Eastern forward deployment, America continues to pay for the

defense of these trading partners, against a threat that, at least in Europe, is

all but extinct. There has to be a new reckoning here. We wish Clinton had begun

it--we wish he had shown the historical imagination to grasp the possibility of

this hour.<p>



That possibility is to begin at once a return to the template of prosperity that

America abandoned in 1917 in order to save Europe from the Kaiser, humanity from

Hitler, and the free world from Stalin. Until then the United States was, in Jane

Jacobs's distinction, a trading nation; since then it has been a raiding

nation--dispatching fleets and garrisoning soldiers around the world. Raiding has

generated its own prosperity, but it is a hectic and unstable one, founded on a

mutable threat. Historians may look back on the Reagan years as America's hour of

triumph against that threat. Or they may look back on those years as the time

when the United States became the world's leading raiding nation--ironically,

just when what Paul Kennedy called (in these pages) "the metric of power" was

changing in international relations, shifting from military might to economic

power, from raiding nations like the United States to trading nations like Japan.

As long as Americans continued to tolerate huge budget deficits, it was at least

logically possible to imagine that we could combine guns and butter, NATO and

domestic investment, raiding and trading. All that was needed was the right set

of budgetary priorities. But a balanced budget that allows for an $80 billion

annual subvention to NATO, the capacity to fight two full-scale wars

simultaneously, and a strategic nuclear force freezes this country into the

outmoded posture of a raiding nation as the metric of power shifts inexorably.<p>



"To govern is to choose," President John F. Kennedy said. We wish President

Clinton had made different choices. This is a rare plastic moment in history, if

only this country's leaders would realize it.

G. (Pat) Robertson, thefounder of the <A HREF="http://www.cbn.org/">Christian Broadcasting Network</A>, fulfilled a long-standing dream.He opened a new graduate-level educational institution in Virginia Beach,Virginia, whose purpose, as Robertson describes it, was to "train mature youngmen and women for the challenge of representing Christ in their professions."<p></font>The entering class in the makeshift rented facilities of what was then calledthe Christian Broadcasting Network University consisted of seventy-sevenstudents--hardly a blip on the screen of American higher education. When Ivisited earlier this year, the school had grown into a graduate university,enrolling more than 1,400 students; it now includes faculties of law, divinity,business, education, counseling, government, and communication, composed ofprofessors with doctoral degrees from Yale, Emory, Oxford, and Cornell, amongother institutions. Faculty members of Regent's law school now prepare draftsof legislation and constitutional amendments that are introduced in Congress.Cinema majors make films for the Special Olympics. Students from the school ofeducation do fieldwork with at-risk children in the black ghetto of nearbyChesapeake. <A HREF="http://www.Regent.edu/">Regent</A> is no longer merely a blip.<p><A HREF="./religind.htm"><img src="../../../images/shorsera.gif" align=leftvspace=10 hspace=10 border=0></A>But just what is it? More than half a century ago Kemper Fullerton wrote anarticle about Oberlin College, in Ohio, which was founded by zealous NewEngland abolitionists, titled "Oberlin, Cause or College?" Similar questionshave been raised about Regent University, which was given its present name in1990, because its board thought that "CBN University" no longer described itaccurately. A "regent," the catalogue explains, is one who represents thesovereign in his absence, and "for us at Regent University, a regent is one whorepresents Christ, our Sovereign, in whatever sphere of life he or she may becalled to serve Him."<p>This is just what gives many people the jitters. Pat Robertson is both founderand chancellor of Regent, and both founder and president of the1.7-million-member <a HREF="http://cc.org/cc/welcome/welcpage.html">Christian Coalition</A>; so it is understandable that the ideaof a university designed to dispatch waves of ardent young graduates into allprofessional spheres might sound ominous to those who harbor reservations aboutthe coalition's potent mixture of old-time religion and up-to-date conservativepolitics. <p>The concept behind Regent is hardly a new one. The idea of preparing an eliteof religiously trained professionals to exert a spiritual influence on thesecular realm has a venerable lineage. Shortly after the founding of the <A HREF="http://maple.lemoyne.edu/~bucko/jesuit.html">Catholic Society of Jesus</A>, in 1540, its members began to study theology incombination with law, literature, history, and the natural sciences. Jesuitsquickly became advisers to kings and tutors to princes, and they foundeduniversities all over the world. Many Jesuits achieved an impressive degree ofeminence in various secular fields. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, for example,was widely respected for his research in paleontology before his theologicalwritings made any impact. Protestants employed the same strategy. The originalpurpose of Harvard College was to steep young men in Puritan theology and theclassical disciplines so that they could steer the new Massachusetts Bay Colonyin a godly direction. Today the debate in universities about how to reintroduce"moral values" into professional education, after many decades of almostexclusive emphasis on technical competence, recalls an earlier age in which thetheological, ethical, and professional disciplines were not so separate as theyusually are at present.<p><center>	<A HREF="./relright.htm"><img src="../art/relright.gif" border=0 alt="(Art)"></A></center>Given my reputation as a liberal Protestant theologian, and given the widepublicity devoted to the political clout of the Christian Coalition, I was bothsurprised and curious when Vinson Synan, the dean of Regent University's Schoolof Divinity, invited me to deliver a lecture about my recent work on theworldwide Pentecostal movement. <A HREF="http://www.harvard.edu/divinity_school/public_html/">Harvard Divinity School</A>, where I have taughttheology for thirty years, might be thought to epitomize the opposite end ofthe theological spectrum. The two universities' schools of law and ofgovernment are widely depicted as representing comparably polar perspectives onmany issues. But that only piqued my curiosity. I may also have been tempted bywhat Thomas Aquinas called the sin of vainglory. My colleagues at Harvard areused to giving guest lectures, so to remark at lunch that one has just returnedfrom speaking at Bologna or the Sorbonne or Cairo hardly elicits a murmur. ButI knew that a casual mention at sherry hour of my visit to Regent, which hasbeen called the Harvard of the Religious Right, was sure to elicit at least aflicker of interest from even the most jaded of my faculty-club associates. Itwas an invitation I could not refuse.<p><p><!--SPACER-->	<p>	<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" vspace=3>	<p><strong>ACADEMIC FREEDOM</strong><p><font size=5>I </font><font size=3>arrived on a balmy day in April. The students I saw wandering among thecolonial buildings of brick and white clapboard, wearing cutoffs, T-shirts, andTeva sandals and carrying canvas book bags, could very well have been the onesI had just left behind in Harvard Yard. I was greeted warmly by several facultymembers, shown my comfortable room (one of 233) at The Founders Inn, and aftera short rest conducted to the law school's elegant mock courtroom to give mylecture. Here the first notable difference between the two Harvards appeared.As I sat reading over my notes and waiting to be introduced, a quartet equippedwith a keyboard and an amplified guitar led the audience in singing livelygospel choruses. Some people clapped and swayed as they sang. I found it hardto imagine this happening in the mock courtroom of Harvard Law School. In mylecture I attributed the astonishing global growth of <A HREF="http://www.prairienet.org/community/religion/fire/upc.html">Pentecostalism</A> to itsemphasis on experience rather than doctrine and to its capacity to absorb suchlocal spiritual practices as ancestor veneration in Africa, folk healing inSouth America, and shamanic trance in Korea. After I spoke, both J. RodmanWilliams, a professor of theology, who proudly told me that he had once studiedat Union Theological Seminary with Reinhold Niebuhr, and Peter Prosser, who hasa Ph.D. in history from the University of Montreal, responded briefly. Theirremarks were critical but thoughtful, appropriate, and collegial. Severalpeople in the largely white audience asked questions. Everyone expressedenthusiasm about the value of this kind of dialogue between liberal andconservative Christians. <p>As I chatted with people at punch hour (no sherry), strolled the campus, andate dinner with some faculty members, it became evident that the atmosphere atRegent University is not that of a backwater fundamentalist Bible school.Regent is proud of its accreditation by the Southern Association of Collegesand Schools, which also certifies schools like William and Mary and theUniversity of Virginia. "We do not want to be another Bob Jones University,"one faculty member told me, referring to the famous fundamentalist college,which shuns accreditation as a sign of compromise with a sinful world. Regent'scatalogue includes a passage describing its philosophy of education, which isphrased in conventional evangelical language. It speaks of the "authority" ofthe <A HREF="http://www.jubilee.org/bible/index.html>Bible</A> (not of its literal truth). It then goes on to mention original sin,the Trinity, and the eventual return of Christ to earth "in power andglory"--not much different from the <A HREF="http://www.mit.edu:8001/afs/athena.mit.edu/activity/l/lem/www/nicene-creed.html">Nicene Creed</A> that <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/web/people/spok/catholic.html">Catholics</A>, <A HREF="http://www.elca.org/">Lutherans</A>, and<A HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/mib/anglican/anglican.html">Episcopalians</A> repeat every week. Immediately following in the catalogue is a"Statement of Academic Freedom," which says that every faculty member "is freeto pursue truth within his or her discipline by research, discussion and otherforms of inquiry," and has a responsibility to "truth [and] scholarlyintegrity." The faculty members I talked with uniformly insisted that they werenot fundamentalists, and some made a decided effort--even when I had notasked--to dissociate themselves from various items on the agenda of theChristian Coalition. But I was still not sure whether Regent was a cause or acollege or a little of both.<p>Regent, it appears, is not so much a boot camp for rightist cadres as amicrocosm of the theological and intellectual turbulence within what is oftenmistakenly seen as a monolithic "religious right" in America. Regent'senergetic young president, Terry Lindvall, likes to compare the student body tothe "motley collection of pilgrims in Chaucer's <em>Canterbury Tales</em>." Ithink he is right, up to a point. For example, although "born-again"Christians, evangelicals, fundamentalists, and Pentecostals are often lumpedtogether in media reports, they represent distinct (though sometimesoverlapping) tendencies that are frequently at odds with one another. Someexplanation of these terms might be helpful. All of them designate Christianswho take their religion seriously--but in different ways.<p><li>"Born-again" is the broadest category. It includes the 39 percent of theAmerican population who claim they have had a personal experience of Christ.Their political ideas span the spectrum, and Jimmy Carter is not the onlyborn-again political liberal.<p><li>"Evangelical" describes a theological position, one recognizing not only theneed for such a personal experience with God but also the unique religiousauthority of Scripture and an obligation to share one's faith with others.<A HREF="http://www.asheville.com/cove.html">Billy Graham</A> is the paradigmatic evangelical.<p><li>"Fundamentalists," though they share many of the evangelicals' beliefs, alsofiercely insist on the "verbal inerrancy" of the Bible, and this has led theminto noisy conflicts over creation and evolution. William Jennings Bryan, whodefended a literal reading of Genesis at the famous Scopes "monkey trial" in1925, was a classic fundamentalist.<p><li>Pentecostals, by far the fastest-growing wing of Christianity today, sharemost evangelical beliefs, but for them all theology is secondary. What is mostimportant is an immediate encounter with the Holy Spirit in a style of worshipthat is exuberant and even ecstatic. Aimee Semple McPherson was the firstPentecostal preacher to achieve celebrity status in America.<p><li>"Charismatics" (the word's root means "gift of grace") are people who practicea Pentecostal form of worship but remain in their own Catholic or Protestantchurches.<p>Someone at Regent told me that more than half its students are eitherPentecostals or charismatics. As such, they bridle at being subsumed under theumbrella of evangelicalism, which some consider cold, rigid, and insufficientlyspontaneous. Theologically conservative evangelicals, on the other hand, whotake their Calvin straight, are leery of the sometimes chaotic andunpredictable spirituality of Pentecostals and of their belief in directrevelation--through dreams and visions--from God.<p>Politically, too, the students and faculty members I met represented a somewhatwider spectrum than I had anticipated. There are some boundaries, of course. Idoubt that a pro-choice bumper sticker would go unremarked in the parking lot,or that a gay-pride demonstration would draw many marchers. But the Regentstudent newspaper carried an opinion piece by the well-known politicallyliberal evangelical (and "friend of Bill") Tony Campolo, a professor at EasternCollege, who has publicly confronted Jerry Falwell about his attacks onPresident Clinton. Ralph Reed, of the Christian Coalition, has persuadedstudents at the school of government to run for office. But one student told mewith obvious satisfaction that he had worked hard to defeat Oliver North in theVirginia senatorial contest last fall. If there is a "line" at Regent, whichwould presumably be a mirror image of the political correctness that isallegedly enforced at elite liberal universities, it is not easy to locate.<p><p><!--SPACER-->	<p>	<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" vspace=3><br>	<strong>CUDDLINGUP TOTHE POPE?</strong><p> <font size=5>A<font size=3>mong the many issues that roil the waters at Regent is thequestion of relations with Roman Catholics. The debate is both political andtheological, and there is much to argue about. Two years ago the archdiocese ofNew York, under Cardinal John O'Connor's leadership, in an unusualdemonstration of Catholic-evangelical cooperation, distributed hundreds ofthousands of Christian Coalition voters' guides in Catholic parishes justbefore the school-board elections. Then, in March of last year, a group offorty evangelical and Roman Catholic leaders issued a public statement,<A HREF="http://saturn.colorado.edu:8080/Christian/EvangAndCath.html">"Evangelicals and Catholics Together: The Christian Mission in the ThirdMillennium."</A> The document was initiated by Father Richard John Neuhaus, aneoconservative writer who had joined the Catholic Church after serving formany years as a Lutheran pastor, and the former White House aide <A HREF="http://wxweb.msu.edu/~zik/colson.html">CharlesColson</A>, now a widely read evangelical columnist. Pat Robertson was one of thesigners. When the statement was issued, news of it, under a banner headline,dominated the front page of the Regent student newspaper. Nationally thedocument came under attack almost immediately from various quarters.Theologically conservative evangelicals claimed that it blurred the legacy ofthe Reformation by not insisting on the Reformation's central doctrinalbequest:justification by grace alone. Politically liberal evangelicals andCatholics contended that it was merely a Trojan horse for right-wing politics. <p>	<a href="./relart2.htm"><img src="./relart2.gif" border=0 alt="" align=left></a>The letters-to-the-editor page of the Regent student newspaper illustrates theuneasiness many conservative Protestants still feel about cuddling up too closeto the Pope, whom their parents' generation identified as the beast of theapocalypse. Student letter writers argue with impressive theologicalearnestness about whether the doctrinal "deviations" of the Catholic Church aresufficiently serious to prevent cooperation and dialogue. One studentcomplained about the "errors" she had been taught in Catholic catechism classbefore becoming a born-again Christian. Others responded that her experiencewas not typical but a "perversion of Catholicism." Catholics are welcomed atRegent, but I wondered what the faculty or the Bible Belt financial supportersof the university might make of a letter from another Regent student, whoinsisted that the teaching she was receiving in a Catholic instruction class"has not been theologically off-base," and that she would soon leaveProtestantism "to enter into the fullness of Truth found in the CatholicChurch." I was astonished to find that the only book review--albeit a verycritical one--in that same issue of the paper was of a controversial booktitled <i>Dancing Alone</i>, by Frank Schaeffer. Once a prominent evangelicalwriter, Schaeffer has recently joined the <A HREF="http://www.maceast.com/usr/om/greek_orthodox_church">Greek Orthodox Church</A>, complainingthat Protestantism is spiritually bankrupt and unable to make a significantimpact on modern society because, he says, it has become "a hybrid composed offragments of the ancient Christian faith and thoroughly modern,anti-traditional, materialist, and often utopian ideas."<p>I did not meet Chancellor Robertson himself at Regent, although he maintains ahandsome residence there. Faculty members told me they rarely see him--that hedoes not "hover," and has delegated the leadership of the university to thepresident. Still, I wondered how much the criticism recently directed atRobertson for his alleged anti-Semitism, especially in his book <i>The NewWorld Order</i> (1991), was being discussed among the faculty. It turned outthat it was being talked about quite a bit, but in a way that I had hardlyexpected. "Pat's no anti-Semite," one faculty member told me. "The problem ishe doesn't write all his own books, and the guys he gets to ghost them are justnot that dependable." <p>But the issue still rankles, and not only at Regent. Since the American Jewishcommunity is itself severely divided between its neoconservative and liberalwings over how to respond to the religious right, any hint of anti-Semitismbecomes particularly poisonous and volatile. Robertson has repeatedly pointedto his unswerving support of Israel as proof positive that he is notanti-Semitic. But the problem goes deeper. There has always been a large wingof conservative Protestant Christianity that vigorously supports the state ofIsrael. However, much of the support is based on an end-time theologicalscenario according to which the return of the Jews to the Holy Land is aprelude to the Battle of Armageddon, the Second Coming, and the subsequentconversion of Jews to Christ. No wonder this all elicits such confusion andalarm in the Jewish community.<p><!--SPACER-->	<p>	<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" vspace=3>	<p><br>		<strong>THE SCIENCE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS</strong><p><font size=5>I</font><font size=3>n visiting other universities, I have often found that snack-bar gossip,casual conversations, and notices on kiosks provide more useful hints about thecampus atmosphere than official publications do. Regent University is noexception. It was clear to me that despite the differences among them, Regentstudents tend to think of themselves as a distinct, sometimes set-uponminority, very much at odds with what they believe is the current misdirectionof American life. Saint Paul's advice to "come ye out and be ye separate" seemsto obtain. Special "Christian-oriented" counseling and twelve-step programs areoffered. In the student newspaper a real-estate dealer advertises, "If you needto buy or sell, I would be blessed to serve you." In ads or on posted notices Isaw Christian CDs, a Christian coffeehouse, a pro-life walkathon, a Christiansingles dance, and a Christian aerobics class. One can even buy a Christianscreen-saver for a computer. Religion-oriented musical groups, such as TheWalter Eugenes and Justo Almario and Abraham Laboriel, get rave notices fromthe paper's music critic, who commends the band called Glad because even thoughthey have "a polished pop sound," they "don't compromise their message toappeal to the mainstream." <p>This constant focus on Christian distinctives could give the impression of awalled and moated subculture. Yet law-school faculty members are busilyconferring with congressional aides a few hours north in Washington. And, asRobertson says, Regent is designed to "sharpen your skills and prepare you totransform the world through Christian leadership." President Lindvall, who cameto his office from the film-studies division of the university, believes thatthe real frontier today is not politics but the arts. Still, it seemed evidentto me that the recurrent historical tension in evangelical Protestantismbetween storming the bastions of the secular world and leaving it to sink inits own sinfulness has not been completely resolved even at Regent.<p>The underlying sources of this and many other tensions at Regent University,and in the conservative Christian community it so accurately reflects, aretheological. To these people, theology matters. It is neither a quaint heirloomof the past nor a mere epiphenomenon of underlying economic and social forces.It is the Science of the Big Questions, mining the past in order to shape thefuture. Part of the ambivalence they feel about to what extent Christiansshould enter the seductive corridors of worldly power stems from continuingdisputes about eschatology. Eschatology is that branch of theology that treatsthe "last things"--the question of how history will end. This subject continuesto fascinate even the most secular minds, but secular culture has handed itover to Trekkies and deep ecologists.<p>Still, beliefs about how it will all come out in the end continue to beintegral to religion. Any churchgoer who recites the Nicene Creed (and millionsdo every week) must wonder on occasion just what the words "And he shall comeagain, with glory, to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shallhave no end" are really supposed to mean. Most theologically conservativeChristians not only accept this doctrine but believe it quite literally. Thisis where the hottest debate begins, for when this return will occur and whatChristians who anticipate it should be doing in the meantime are matters ofsharp disagreement. <p>Since the rise of fundamentalism, in the early years of the twentieth century,the favored eschatology among its adherents has been that Jesus Christ willactually return before the establishment of his millennial Kingdom, and in themeantime things will get progressively worse on earth. There will be wars andrumors of wars as we spiral downward. This is the so-called pre-millennialview, popularized in Hal Lindsey's paperback broadside <i>The Late Great PlanetEarth </i>(1970), which has sold more than 12 million copies. In that bookLindsey analyzed the Cold War, the role of Israel, and the moral decline ofAmerica in the light of his own inventive reading of the Books of <A HREF="http://www.jubilee.org/bible/27.daniel.html">Daniel</A> and<A HREF="http://www.jubilee.org/bible/66.revelation.html">Revelation</A>, and announced that the final great battle of Armageddon was aboutto begin.<p>This somewhat overheated "living-in-the-last-days" mentality is, however,vociferously opposed by another school of conservative Christian eschatology,which is called postmillennialism. A considerably more upbeat view, it holdsthat through the faithfulness of individuals and the influence they bring tobear on societies, righteousness and justice will gradually spread andincrease. Consequently, when Christ comes again, the earth will be prepared forhis appearance. The postmillennial idea reigned virtually uncontested inAmerican Protestantism from the time of Jonathan Edwards until the appearanceof fundamentalism, around 1900. Since then the two parties have been feuding,but in the past decade the postmillennial view has staged a comeback. It isclearly dominant at Regent.<p>Pre-millennial and postmillennial eschatologies generate opposing visions ofwhat believers should be doing in a fallen world. If conditions are inevitablyto degenerate until the return of Christ (as in Lindsey's view), there islittle point to political activism. But if the persistent efforts of thefaithful can help to hasten the coming of the reign of God, there is somereason to lobby Congress or run for office.<p>Pat Robertson apparently started out in his earlier years with thepre-millennial view about the imminent approach of the last days that then heldsway among most fundamentalists. It seems, however, that he has since alteredhis opinions. He now subscribes to a postmillennial eschatology in whichChristians--at least the ones who share his views--are called upon to try toassume positions of power wherever they can in order to build a more righteousand God-fearing society. <p><!--SPACER-->	<p>	<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" vspace=3>	<p><strong> THE DOMINION CONTROVERSY</strong><p><font size=5>B</font><font size=3>ut just how are Christians to exert influence? This brings up what hasundoubtedly been the most contentious issue at Regent. It has to do withsomething called "dominion theology." A subset within postmillennial theology,the dominion school holds that Christians (and, some would add, religious Jews)have inherited all the Old Testament mandates, one of the most fundamental ofwhich is in <A HREF="http://www.jubilee.org/bible/01.genesis.html">Genesis 1:28</A>, where God says to Adam and Eve, "Be fruitful, andmultiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over thefish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over <i>every living thingthat moveth upon the earth</i>" (emphasis added). Dominion theologiansinterpret this passage to mean that believers are entitled to "dominion" overall the world's major institutions. They should rule the earth until Christcomes again, no matter what the duration of their interim reign. Some ofRobertson's critics believe that such a vision--an entire nation run at alllevels by the faithful--is what inspired Robertson to rename his university"Regent," and they find this frightening.<p>Their concerns, it would seem, are not entirely groundless. At times Robertsonhas written, in what gives a strong impression of being a dominion-theologyvoice, that Regent is to be a "Kingdom institution," in which people will betaught how to "enter into the privilege they have as God's representatives onearth." In <i>The New World Order</i>, the book that brought the issue ofpossible anti-Semitism freshly to the fore, Robertson presents a summary of hispolitical theology, writing that only those "who believe the Judeo-Christianvalues" are qualified to rule, and then goes on to spell out this doctrine. <blockquote>There will never be world peace until God's house and God's peopleare given their rightful place of leadership at the top of the world. How canthere be peace when drunkards,communists, atheists, New Age worshipers of Satan, secular humanists,oppressive dictators, greedy moneychangers, revolutionary assassins,adulterers, and homosexuals are on top?</blockquote><p>It is not surprising that someone who falls into one of the categories listed should feel somedisquietude about the political positions staked out here. But if--as strictdominion theology holds--all Old Testament laws are currently applicable, andnot only to so-called Christian nations but to all nations and to everyinstitution within those nations, then such ideas emerge naturally.<p><p><!--SPACER-->	<p>	<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" vspace=3><br><strong>PAT ROBERTSON: A MODERATING INFLUENCE?</strong><p><font size=5>I </font><font size=3>thought it was important, if awkward, to bring up these questions with Regentfaculty members. And I did so. The answer was very clear. Regent, theyinsisted, is absolutely not a dominion-theology school, and Robertson himselfhad demonstrated this recently by getting rid of the dean of the law school,Herbert Titus, because Titus was leaning in the dominion direction. (Titus, whowas a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union before his conversion toevangelical Christianity, is currently suing the school for about $70 million.)I did not wave quotations from Robertson's books in front of anyone, because bythis time I thought I might hear once again that he just doesn't choose hisghostwriters carefully enough. Also, Terry Lindvall sounded persuasive when hetold me that whatever might have been the case in the past, the battle overHerbert Titus had really been a "struggle for the soul of the university" inwhich the dominion-theology party had decisively lost. "This is no Masada," hesaid. "We just want the evangelical voice to be heard and to make a positivecontribution." In his mind, the matter was settled once and for all.<p>By the time I left Virginia Beach, I was somewhat--but notcompletely--satisfied by the answers the faculty had given me. I had to puttogether those reassurances with what Ihad previously learned in <em>Heaven onEarth?</em>, an excellent book on the subject of dominion theology by theAmerican historian Bruce Barron. As I have pointed out in my book <em>Fire FromHeaven</em>, Barron suggests that the faculty members of Regent University are amoderating influence in the dominion-theology movement. They are pragmatistswho accept religious pluralism and do not insist on the universal applicabilityof Old Testament law. They prefer to be called "constitutionalists," a labelthat refers to their belief that current legal practice has drifted away fromthe principles outlined in the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration ofIndependence--principles they believe are deeply rooted in biblical law.<p>Still, my doubts remained. Not only did I suffer momentary cognitive dissonancein thinking of Pat Robertson as a moderating influence but I found myselfdisturbed by the influential ideas of another figure in the postmillennialmovement: <A HREF="http://www.wavefront.com/~contra_m/cm/interviews/cm13_interview.html">Rousas John Rushdoony</A>. Rushdoony is a theologian who writesprolifically, albeit for a somewhat small audience, and his 1,124-page <i>TheRoots of Reconstruction</i> includes a proposal that the death penalty beenforced today for adulterers, homosexuals, blasphemers, astrologers, witches,and teachers of false doctrine. The thought of Rushdoony's disciples gaininggovernmental power qualifies as the real nightmare scenario presented by thereligious right. What surprised me, however, was that his ideas have gainedacceptance among some Pentecostals, because Rushdoony clearly does not care forPentecostals. He takes a jab at them in another of his books, <i>The Institutesof Biblical Law</i>, when, in repeatedly making the case for the presentvalidity of Old Testament law, he says, "If the law is denied as the means ofsanctification, then, logically, the only alternative [for believers] isPentecostalism, with its antinomian and unbiblical doctrine of the Spirit."Somehow I did not think that Rushdoony would have enjoyed the warm-upsing-along in the Regent mock courtroom.<p>When I reflected on my visit to Regent, it occurred to me that given thepresent uncontested global hegemony of the market mentality and consumervalues, Regent may in fact be an even more intriguing place to visit thanCairo. In a sometimes confused and internally conflicted way it represents analternative world view in an age when such alternatives are hard to come by. Ialso had a sense of historical d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. When the visionaries whofounded Harvard and the Massachusetts Bay Colony tried to prepare young men toshape the values of the new commonwealth, the principal difficulty they raninto was religious pluralism. Baptists like Roger Williams were exiled to the"cesspool of New England," in Rhode Island. Quakers were whipped or hanged.Unwilling to sort through the thicket of conflicting theologies, Harvardeventually solved the problem by discarding the explicitly religious basis ofits mission. But now, as it, along with other universities, seeks to reinstatemoral values in the curriculum, questions about where such values come from andabout the spiritual traditions that have nourished them over the millennia willhave to be engaged. As this happens, it will no longer be sufficient simply tostudy religion from the comparative and historical perspectives. Values arerooted in narrative; so the historical religious traditions, includingChristianity and Judaism, along with secular philosophies of life, will have tobe studied as viable life options. Without roots, disembodied "values" becomemere preferences and eventually dissolve into the ether.<p>Like the people I met at Regent, I look forward to continuing this vitaldialogue. I also agree that for too long evangelicals and more-liberalProtestants, Catholics, Pentecostals, and people of other religious traditionshave huddled in compounds of their own making rather than asking what they cando together to encourage the spiritual renaissance they all believe Americaneeds. And I think we need to remember the past in order to shape the future.At the same time, I harbor some deep reservations about both the theologicaland the political motifs I encountered at Regent. If Colonial Harvard could nothandle Baptists and Quakers, can Regent's theology speak to an America that hasmore Buddhist and Muslim and Hindu citizens every day? How diverse could Regentbecome? Could the "motley collection of pilgrims" on the way to Canterbury everinclude gay Christians who also want to be part of the procession? After all,the Wife of Bath and her ribald traveling companions were hardly models offamily values. <p><p><!--SPACER-->	<p>	<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" vspace=3>	<p><br>	<strong>THELIBERATION-THEOLOGYPARALLEL</strong><p><font size=5>B</font><font size=3>y far the most striking discovery I made at Regent was the remarkablesimilarity between the rhetoric I encountered there and that of liberationtheology. Both focus on continuing the ministry and work of Jesus. Both placethe concept of the Kingdom of God, albeit interpreted quite differently, at thecenter of their respective theologies. And both stress the importance of<i>institutional</i> change rather than simple individual conversion. But why,then, does liberation theology usually produce a more progressive expression ofreligious activism, while Regent's theology usually engenders conservativepublic policy? Why does so much evangelical social theology slide so easilyover Jesus' harsh warnings to the rich and the powerful, so that one rarelyhears any criticism of corporations that close their factories to help thebottom line, or of congressmen who pour more money into the military than thePentagon itself asks for? <p>The crucial difference is the "preferential option for the poor" thatliberation theology has so eloquently championed and that was so central to theministry of Jesus. Liberation theology aims to work for institutions that areresponsive to the poor and disinherited of any society, and placing Christiansin positions of power is not among its goals. That said, however, it can stillbe unsettling to hear Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Pat Robertson both employinga political rhetoric that is rich in "Kingdom principles" and the applicationof biblical values to society.<p>What understandably flusters liberal Christians about Regent University's (andPat Robertson's) ambitious project, which is now quite possibly on the verge ofsome actual political success, is that for years the so-called mainlinechurches have chided Pentecostals and evangelicals for promising people pie inthe sky while turning their backs on the suffering and injustice of the presentworld. But now this is no longer the case. Since movements like the ChristianCoalition have swung into energetic participation in the political realm,religious liberals seem to be hoist on their own petard. They can hardlycriticize Robertson or the jurists and theologians at Regent for jumping intopolitics. But if they differ as to goals and methods, they will have to arguethe case on theological grounds, and come up with a different but equallyconvincing interpretation of the Bible and of Christian history. There are manyhistorical sources they could draw on--not just liberation theology but alsosuch traditions as British Christian socialism (which the Labour Party leader,Tony Blair, now espouses), the American Social Gospel, and Reinhold Niebuhr.The problem is that many politically liberal Christian theologians have becomeso enchanted by deconstruction, postmodernism, and secular politicalphilosophies that they find it hard to engage people like the Regent facultymembers at the theological level on which the argument has to proceed. <p>When I asked Terry Lindvall about his personal hopes for Regent, he told methat he is still a film maker at heart, and that he believes the next centurywill be shaped by the people who can tell the best stories. Later I rememberedthat <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> itself is about a traveling storytellingcontest, in which the Wife of Bath, the Friar, the Merchant, the Monk, and theKnight all have a go, and nobody censors anybody else. It could be afascinating journey. </blockquote><hr><pre></pre><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

black-on-black canvases were the "last pictures which anyone can make." The

critics raved, and many agreed with the "Black Monk" that his masterpieces

would be history's "ultimate" paintings. Unfortunately, other artists refused

to hand in their brushes, so art continued.

Ever since, modern art has resembled a doomsday cult on the day after the

deadline for the end of the world. The true believers awoke one day to find

that the sun had risen, the mad prophet had disappeared, and they all had to

find something to do with the rest of their lives.<p>

This predicament is now called Postmodernism, and if you're confused about it,

that's probably because you're beginning to understand it. If you're an artist,

what follows will be old hat. But as a service to the layman I can define a few

of the basic terms. <p>



<B>Modern Art:</B> In the future "modern art" will mean "the kind of art they did in

the twentieth century." Like "Baroque"or "Romanesque," "modern" will be a term

used to date something.<p>



<B>Cubism:</B> A movement started by Picasso and <A HREF="http://netspot.city.unisa.edu.au/wm/paint/auth/braque/">Braque</A> to distinguish their work

 from

what <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/wm/paint/auth/cezanne/works.html">C&eacute;zanne</A> had already done. Critics named it Cubism. In modern art,

naming your art movement is a must. Cubism is still the most important

modern-art movement, for the same reason that John D. is still the most

important Rockefeller. All the other movements are like downtown Rockefellers,

and you can forget about them unless you expect to encounter an art category on

<i>Jeopardy</i>.<p>



<B>Futurism:</B> This was a movement of intellectuals who wanted to replace

 tradition

with the modern world of machinery, speed, violence, and public relations. It

proves that we should be careful what intellectuals wish for, because we might

get it.<p>



<B>Dada:</B> <A HREF="http://www.mercon.com/mercon/pyramid/edjames/surrdada.html">Dada</A> artists were ironists. Duchamp was their star, and his masterpiece

was a urinal. He ended his life playing chess. He claimed he was making an art

statement. My grandfather was a prankster too, and he ended his life playing

chess. But since he did it to keep from being bored, no one thought it proved

anything. This suggests that Dada artists are exempt from the general rule that

ironists are the biggest victims of their own irony.<p>



<B>Surrealism:</B> An archaic term. Formerly an art movement, no longer distinguishable

from everyday life.<p>



<B>Abstract Expressionism:</B> After the Second World War the United States emerged as

the world's superpower. American companies like Cities Service and Esso, which

had once been regional businesses, became international corporations. They

adopted abstract names like Citgo and Exxon to give themselves world-class

status. Since multinational giants couldn't have little pictures of red barns

or weeping clowns in the lobbies of their Bauhaus buildings, Abstract

Expressionism emerged as the world's most prized  form of interior decoration.

<p>



<B>Pop Art:</B> In aristocratic societies rich people used to commission exquisite

paintings for their walls. Years later cheap imitations would filter down to

calendars in gas stations. In our democratic society this works backward. Here

art begins as the kind of picture you'd find on a matchbook cover. Then in a

few years expensive imitations of it wind up on the walls of plastic surgeons

and Hollywood agents.<p>



<B>New Wave Art:</B> Modern art as it would have been done by the Big Bopper, the

Del-Vikings, or Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs. New Wave art was the rage of the

eighties. Now it's exhibited in oldies-but-goodies museums, usually in

black-and-pink frames.<p>



<B>Graffiti Art:</B> Many people decorate their homes with designer graffiti, even

though most of them would probably have real graffiti scoured off the walls of

their buildings. Personally, I think that graffiti artists should go to the

homes of their patrons with spray cans and make their living rooms look like

subway cars. This would separate serious lovers of graffiti from uptowners

spelunking for art thrills.<p>



<B>Realism:</B> Currently, realistic paintings are valued for their craftsmanship. In

the next century, when art will be packaged as virtual-reality software,

realistic paintings will sell the way Shaker furniture does now. Shaker

furniture will sell the way Van Gogh paintings do. Pop-It Beads owned by Jackie

Onassis will come to market only occasionally.<p>



<B>Commercial Art:</B> Anything done by an artist with a cash register by the door.

Commercial art is traditionally delivered to a client in a brown-paper bag with

an invoice stapled to the outside.<p>



<B>Fine Art:</B> With commercial art you find out how much they're going to pay you,

and you do the work. With fine art it's the other way around. <p>



<B>"That's Not Art, That's Illustration":</B> Almost everybody is an artist these

days. Rock-and-roll singers are artists. So are movie directors, performance

artists, makeup artists, tattoo artists, con artists, and rap artists. Movie

stars are artists. Madonna is an artist because she explores her own sexuality.

Snoop Doggy Dogg is an artist because he explores other people's sexuality.

Victims who express their pain are artists. So are guys in prison who express

themselves on shirt cardboard. Even consumers are artists when they express

themselves in their selection of commodities. The only people left in America

who seem not to be artists are illustrators. <p>



<B>Love Me, Love My Art:</B> Norman Rockwell used to say if a picture is going badly,

put a dog in it. If it is going really badly, put a bandage on the dog's

paw. This is the basic principle behind victim art.<p>



<B>Tattoo Art:</B> I've never liked tattoos, although I think they improve some

people--especially the kind of people who hang around tattoo parlors. <p>



<B>Kitsch:</B> In my lifetime kitsch has progressed from the cynical sentimentality of

Maxfield Parrish calendars to the sentimental cynicism of Batman movies. <p>



<B>Style:</B> Style is the most valuable asset of the modern artist. That's probably

why so many styles are reported lost or stolen each year. <p>



<B>Tradition:</B> There are still some traditionalists, mostly employed by art schools,

who continue to paint like members of the Ash Can School, with earnest First

World War realism. For years it has pleased the avant-garde to keep these Amish

around to portray the art establishment. But for generations the real art

establishment has been made up of earth sculptors, body piercers, and topless

cello players. It's been a long time since a painter of the Ash Can School has

even had a prayer.<p>



<B>The Avant-garde:</B> More than a hundred years ago some French bohemians decreed

that the purpose of art was to shock the middle classes. It may have been a

great idea back then. But these days the middle classes aren't paying

attention. They're all on <i>Jerry Springer</i> or <i>Ricki Lake</i>, talking

about their cross-dressing experiences or sex with the baby-sitter.

Cutting-edge artists have to watch this stuff in despair and complain about the

state of American culture even as they demand more grant money to do their

cutting-edge art. In the future this spectacle of the middle classes shocking

the avant-garde will probably become the textbook definition of Postmodernism.

<p>



<B>"Sometimes You Gotta Break the Rules":</B> One of the things not enough people

appreciate about modern art is that its philosophy can be summed up as a Burger

King commercial. <p>



<B>Craftsmanship:</B> Traditional craftsmen worked within certain conventions.

Occasionally those conventions would be redefined by acts of genius. In modern

art, though, everybody has to redefine art all the time. This might have made

our era another Renaissance, if only there had been a sudden explosion of

geniuses in the world. But since ego is more common than genius, Postmodern art

is destined to be more narcissistic than heroic.<p>



<B>Art Theory:</B> The typical modern artist produces a small body of work wrapped in a

theory. Some even dispense with the work itself and exhibit only their

theories, typed up. To me this seems a sensible economy of style. If the

purpose of art is to redefine art, then words should do the trick. There's no

use cluttering up the world with redundant examples.<p>



<B>Self-expression:</B> The crowbar used by artists to pry open the Pandora's box of

self-indulgence for everybody else in society. Thirty years ago it was the

dream of every bohemian artist to be seen getting out of a limousine wearing

blue jeans and sneakers. Today it's the dream of probably half the people in

the country. <p>



<B>The Miracle of Authenticity:</B> The faith that if we're all authentic and express

ourselves, society will benefit. A charming ideal, but it overlooks the

obvious. There are a lot of authentic jerks and idiots in the world.

Encouraging them to express themselves will never do anybody much good, much

less society.<p>



<B>Instinct:</B> Back in the prehistoric jungle all the animals who trusted other

animals got eaten. The only ones who survived to reproduce were the ones who

instinctively feared everybody and bit their heads off. This explains why so

many people who, like artists, trust their instincts behave like crocodiles. <p>



<B>Consciousness-Raising Art:</B> An all-purpose excuse for the artist to cast himself

as a pearl before the swine of democracy. Whenever I know that an artist is

trying to raise my consciousness, I have flashbacks of Jane Fonda, Sissy Spacek,

and Jessica Lange lecturing Congress about the realities of farm life. <p>



<B>Forever Jung:</B> Postmodernists believe that truth is myth and myth truth. This

equation has its roots in pop psychology. The same people also believe that

emotions are a form of reality. There used to be another name for this state of

mind. It was calledpsychosis. <p>



<B>Multiculturalism:</B> I've never understood why artists, who so often condescend to

the clich&eacute;s of their own culture, are so eager to embrace the

clich&eacute;s of cultures they know nothing about.<p>



<B>Waiting for Van Gogh:</B> In the world in which most of us have grown up, popular

art has inherited and exploded all the forms of art that came before it.

Everything from the primitive art of tribal societies to the fine art of

aristocratic ones has been thrown into the cement mixer of modern culture,

along with its juxtapositions of celebrity and anonymity, poverty and sudden

wealth, and the continuous swooning of the popular media over trends and fads.

The truth about Postmodernism is that we haven't really figured out yet how

artists will thrive in modern mass societies. We're all experiments.

<font size=5>W</font>ITHIN the confined universe of commercial literature it is not uncommon to

recognize in the writing of one author an allusion or event recalling the work

of another. References are a natural way for writers to pay tribute to peers

and predecessors. One well-known tribute in American literature comes near the

end of <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>, when Holden Caulfield finds and erases an

obscenity scrawled in a school stairwell, an obvious tip of the literary cap by

J. D. Salinger to F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose Nick Carraway, twenty years

earlier, was dismayed to find an epithet in the same spirit etched on Jay

Gatsby's steps in <i>The Great Gatsby</i>.<p>



Occasionally, however, a work comes along in which the motivation for literary

cap-tipping seems less straightforward. In such a work references and passages

found in a previously published volume are echoed so insistently as to leave

the reader wondering whether the similarities constitute a deliberate though

unacknowledged homage--or not.<p>



Jay McInerney's ambitious new novel of the American South is such a work: it

contains such an uncanny series of likenesses to Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer

Prize-winning novel <a href="http://www.lacollege.edu/classes/en446/profiles

/warren/project.html"><i>All the King's Men </i></a>(1946) that to attempt a

comparison of the two novels becomes almost irresistible.<p>



In <i>The Last of the Savages</i>, McInerney relates the rise to power, and the

eventual decay, of Will Savage, an idealistic, mercurial southerner bent on

creating an empire in the name of an oppressed people--in this case, the

ceaselessly exploited black blues musicians of the South. Narrating the story

is Patrick Keane, Savage's best friend and sometime confidant, a passive,

self-effacing bystander to the chaos who nevertheless remains close enough to

his subject to report from the insider's point of view, yet is just far enough

outside the circle of corruption to avoid the mammon that ultimately leads to

his friend's collapse. <p>



Many readers will recall roughly the same story line in <i>King's Men</i>.

Those who do not can simply repeat the paragraph above, substitute the name

Willie Stark for Will Savage, poor white southern taxpayers for poor black

southern blues musicians, and Jack Burden for Patrick Keane, and come up with a

pretty fair summation of that book's plot. The alliterative similarity of the

protagonists' names aside, however, such a story line, or device by which to

tell it, is not in and of itself necessarily remarkable--Fitzgerald, for one,

employed the same innocent-witness-relates-tale-of-American-Dream-and-demise in

<i>Gatsby</i>. But the parallels between <i>Savages</i> and <i>King's Men</i>

do not flower at the surface only to wither in the subtext. In fact, they

sprout sturdy roots that plunge continually deeper as the novel passes through

its seasons.<p>



Strikingly similar casts of characters surround Savage and Stark. Each hires a

gun-wielding flunky to serve as bodyguard and sycophant (Stubblefield in

Savage's case, Sugar-Boy in Stark's). Both men tomcat with a string of bimbos,

floozies, and otherwise available women while remaining technically married but

separated from their wives, and both eventually return to their wives. Both are

labeled "nigger-lovers" by enemies.<p>



Plot details in the two books seem scripted by parallel minds. An early scene

in each book presents duck hunting as the narrator's rite of passage into

southern manhood. Both narrators receive instruction from tough-as-nails but

paternal southern gentlemen. Keane's mentor is Cordell Savage, Will's father

("On an incoming bird, just try to put the bead below its beak"); Burden's is

Judge Montague Irwin ("You got to lead a duck, son"). Symbolic relevance of the

hunting episodes to subsequent events is later revealed. <p>



Both narrators also find themselves betrayed by their friend-subject. Savage

winds up sleeping with Lollie Baker, the object of Keane's adolescent desire,

Stark with Anne Stanton, Jack Burden's onetime girlfriend. These women occupy

like positions in the narrators' sexual development: Keane finds himself on the

brink of losing his virginity to Baker when a surprise appearance by his school

housemaster thwarts the proceedings. Keane hides in the closet to avoid

scandal. In a similar sequence of events the virginal and near-naked Burden and

Stanton are nearly discovered by Burden's mother. Stanton hides in the

bathroom, and honor is preserved.<p>



<font size=5>H</font>OLLYWOOD could not have dreamed up a coincidence more improbable than the one

that introduces subplots in both books in the form of Civil War-era diaries and

letters used by the respective narrators as the centerpiece of a university

history thesis. In <i>Savages</i> history major Keane uses excerpts from the

1861 diary of Binnie Pilcher Savage as a jumping-off point for research into a

tragic plantation saga that began with the sale of the wife of a slave. In

<i>King's Men</i> history doctoral candidate Burden bases his dissertation on

the 1850s and 1860s papers of Cass Mastern, which tell the story of a

plantation disaster following the sale of a slave wife. Both projects conclude

unsatisfactorily--Keane's work is rejected for publication; Burden simply gives

up on his before graduation.<p>



Paternal confusion and Oedipal conflict grow in fertile soil. Keane is the

biological father of Savage's son, through artificial insemination, though his

own wife doesn't know it. Burden ultimately discovers that his true father is

Judge Irwin. Part of Cordell Savage's reputation is based on a legend that he

killed his abusive father to protect his mother. Burden confesses that "by

killing my father I had saved my mother's soul."<p>



In <i>Savages</i>, McInerney uses the same vehicle of redemption that Warren

used in <i>King's Men</i>. In the latter Willie Stark tries to reclaim his

once-pure soul by building a gargantuan hospital for the South's common folk, a

place where "any man or woman or child who is sick or in pain" may receive free

treatment. Stark becomes obsessed by the project, which he intends to keep

unsoiled by the rotten politics and dirty money that have corrupted him.

McInerney bestows on his hero the same altruistic plan as recompense for a

wanton past. After selling his interest in a record label, Savage immediately

pours $20 million "into a free clinic and hospital in the Mississippi Delta."

Savage's wife, Taleesha, says later, "The free clinic was a wonderful idea, but

if he doesn't stop giving away money . . . I think that's what he wants, you

know, to give it all away, to wash his hands."<p>



And though in the end Stark dies and Savage lives, their lives, along with the

lives of their biographers, are summed up in similar style. On the last page of

his book McInerney writes, "If this has been the story of Will's life, more

than my own, that is because he has lived." Fifty years earlier, four pages

from the end of his book, Warren wrote, "This has been the story of Willie

Stark, but it is my story, too. For I have a story. It is the story of a man

who lived. . . ."<p>



McInerney makes fleeting references to previously published material. In

Chapter 14 he writes, "I think it was Faulkner--usually a safe bet in these

matters--who said the Mississippi Delta originated in the lobby of the

Peabody." He mentions favorite books, poets, and authors, and as many southern

icons as possible: Robert E. Lee, Elvis Presley, Medgar Evers, Tennessee

Williams, <i>Gone With the Wind</i>, Alabama sharecroppers, Shilo, Chickamauga,

Martin Luther King Jr., Huck Finn, Robert Johnson, Colonel Tom Parker, James

Earl Ray, Jimmy Carter, Civil War re-enactors, Stonewall Jackson, Jeb Stuart,

the Ku Klux Klan, Otis Redding, Sam Phillips, and Henry Clay, among others. But

he does not mention <i>All the King's Men</i>, Robert Penn Warren, or even Huey

Long, the famed southern politician upon whose life <i>King's Men</i> is widely

believed to be based, although Long is never mentioned in that book. The

closest McInerney gets to any acknowledgment of inspiration from <i>King's

Men</i> comes in a cast-off line from Will Savage: "All you need to know is

that it's about as venal and corrupt as Louisiana politics."<p>



What is one to make of all this? Four questions come to mind. Was everyone

expected to notice all these parallels (as one notices the parallels between

<i>Roger's Version</i> and <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, or between <i>West Side

Story</i> and <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>)? Was nobody supposed to notice?Are the

parallels a matter of sheer coincidence--just one of those things?And finally,

what does McInerney do with the rich lode of material he is working--what kind

of a novel is this, what are its aspirations, and to what extent does it

succeed?Unfortunately, the book itself, the book jacket, and the accompanying

publicity materials are mute on the first three questions, and so we must

suspend inquiry and turn to the fourth.<p>



McInerney has a reputation as a stylist, but in <i>Savages</i> his prose has

all the sparkle of a parking ticket. Set-piece descriptions end in lines like

"What can I say--we were all very young at the time." Some of the dialogue sags

under the weight of generic exposition. For example, here is Cordell Savage on

his son's involvement with a black woman:



<BLOCKQUOTE>

"It may be up here [at Yale] . . . there's nothing wrong with it. . . . But I'm

telling you that down south this is a very grave matter. We have a heritage. We

live in the world that was given to us. Even if I wanted to give my blessings,

the fact is Will would have to contend with the judgment of an entire society.

. . . And I don't think I have to tell you, Patrick, it would kill his poor

mother."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



That is boilerplate southern. If you heard it in a movie you'd hoot. Here is

boilerplate New York City:



<BLOCKQUOTE>

They dropped me off at the Yale Club,  and I watched the cab pull away, feeling

the bittersweet loneliness of the city as the champagne faded from the sooty

canyon of Vanderbilt Avenue. . . . Someday these would be my streets.

Meanwhile, I found myself on Fifth Avenue, moving with a crowd admiring the

lavish windows of Saks. . . .

</BLOCKQUOTE>



Saks gets fresher stuff from its billing department. "Bittersweet loneliness"

is the equivalent of George Bush's "Message: I care." It's stage direction for

a bad play.<p>



Whatever McInerney's rank among modern novelists, he has yet to produce a work

of real stature. The poet <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/atlantic/about/

people/phdbio.htm"> Peter Davison</a> once remarked, unkindly, that if in

McInerney's first novel, <i>Bright Lights, Big City</i>, one replaced every use

of the word "cocaine" with the word "chocolate," it would be a children's book.

<p>



"There is always something," Willie Stark keeps saying to the naive Jack

Burden: there are human flaws to be found everywhere, if you look for them hard

enough. And Will Savage, ever the watchdog for cultural raids on his southern

turf, gives Patrick Keane an early lesson on the right and wrong ways (to

paraphrase Isaac Newton) to stand upon the shoulders of giants, so that one

might see farther. In the first meeting between the two, after playing several

blues records, Savage berates Keane for his naivet&eacute;. "When, after the

song ended, I ventured that I liked the Beatles, [Will] sneered. 'This is the

real thing,' he said. 'At least the Stones acknowledge their sources.'"

(a political term going back to the 1920s, and a pre-Swing Era example of <I>cat</I> meaning 
"person") and endorsements from political <I>bigwigs.</I> <I>Bigwig</I> began in metonymy (the use 
of a word as a name for something else, with which it is associated), doubtless 
prompted by the fashionable oversized perukes sported by British aristocrats in the 
seventeenth century and later. (Big wigs--some might call them <I>rugs</I> today--became 
traditional on the heads of English jurists before 1700, and they are still going 
strong.) <p>

In politics or out, no <I>bigwig</I> wants to be referred to as a <I>high</I> (or <I>big</I>) 
<I>muckamuck</I> (or <I>muckymuck</I> or <I>mucketymuck.</I>) Nobody likes muck, but there is none in 
<I>muckamuck</I> 's origin: among the Nootka of Vancouver Island <I>mak(a)mak</I> 
means "food," and in the Chinook jargon of traders in the Northwest <I>hayo makamak</I> 
meant "lots to eat." Consider the superficial resemblance of <I>hayo</I> 
to "high." Chinook-speakers offering guests a lavish meal on windy frontier coasts might 
be thought of as the <I>bigwigs</I> of local society. In surfer idiom a synonymous term would be 
<I>big kahunas,</I> from the native Hawaiian word for an island priest, sorcerer, or healer.<p>

<IMG SRC="./tacohead.gif" alt="" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="258" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10">


The remarkable <I>mugwump,</I> which attained a high profile in the Cleveland-Blaine 
presidential race of 1884, isn't usually associated with the meaning "political 
grandee," but in fact that's how it started out. The <I>New York Sun</I> had ridiculed some 
prominent Republicans for bolting the party to support Grover Cleveland: the phrase 
used was "the Little <I>Mugwumps;</I>" a month later Thomas Nast drew a <I>mugwump</I>
 cartoon for 
<I>Harper's Weekly.</I> <I>Mugwump</I> thus became a term for a political turncoat. Originally, 
though, <I>mugwump</I> was a word roughly equivalent to <I>bigwig.</I> In the Algonquian
 dialect of 
the Natick Indians of Massachusetts, <I>mugquomp</I> meant "great man." The Puritan missionary
John Eliot even used it for the English words "duke" and "centurion" in his 1661-1663 
translation of the Bible into Algonquian, the first Bible published in the Colonies. The
popular etymology of <I>mugwump</I>--which explains the word by reference to 
the phrase "his mug's on one side of the fence and his wump's on the 
other"--is spurious. <p>

And then there's <I>big enchilada</I>--one of the newest <I>bigwig</I> terms. 
On Richard Nixon's White House tape of March 27, 1973, the presidential aide John Erlichman 
can be heard calling Attorney General John Mitchell "the <I>big enchilada"</I>--the biggest 
<I>bigwig</I> yet linked by investigators to the mess of scandals known as Watergate. Four years 
later, after the tapes had made <I>big enchilada</I> a slang fixture, Erlichman, an enchilada 
aficionado, told William Safire that he had cooked up the new meaning himself. Had the tape not 
been running, our food-allusive slang for <I>big shot</I> might still be limited to <I>big cheese</I>. 
<I>Big cheese</I> preceded <I>big shot</I> itself, which burst onto the scene in the 1920s, frequently
in discussions of crime. Conjecture is inevitable: <I>big shot</I> may have been based on <I>big 
gun</I>, with a little help from the once popular <I>big noise</I>. Erlichman mused that he might 
as easily have called Mitchell "the <I>big fish,</I>" a metaphor from at least the 1830s which 
probably made its debut in American literature in James Fenimore Cooper's <I>The Redskins</I> 
(1846). Unlike a <I>big cheese</I>, a <I>big fish</I> (most often some kind of ringleader) is usually 
somebody to be <I>hooked</I> by law-enforcement officials rather than to be envied for his 
power and success.<p>

Doing the hooking could be <I>the man</I>--a term for anybody in authority, male or female, from
the cop on the beat all the way up. This is an idiom long applied in the South to any 
man whose role is obvious in conversational context ("The washing machine's on the blink
again." "Better not fool with it--call the man"). The civil-rights movement broadcast the
specific sense "policeman." <I>The Man</I> (usually capitalized) soon 
personified "the System," especially as conceived in neo-Marxist doctrine.<p>

<blockquote>



	<font size=5>A</font>SK a man who owns one:

Andr&eacute; Emmerich, the author of "Abloom With Art" in this issue, about

America's sculpture parks, is himself the proprietor of a renowned sculpture

park. Top Gallant, as it is called, sprawls across 150 acres, most of which

once made up a Quaker dairy farm, in rural New York State. Presenting an

ever-changing selection of 100 to 130 works by leading modernist sculptors, Top

Gallant is an adjunct to the Andr&eacute; Emmerich Gallery, in New York City,

which Emmerich has owned and run since 1954, and which has recently entered

into an association with Sotheby's.<p>



The sculpture at Top Gallant is--if this is possible--even more lovingly 

installed than are the works on exhibit in the gallery.  Here on the shore 

of a pond that Emmerich arranged to have dug are four geometric, immensely 

tall, brightly colored marvels by the California sculptor Fletcher Benton.  

There at the top of a hill sits Donald Lipski's eleven-foot-high ball of 

rope with leather fittings, which was featured in the 1991 <A 

HREF="http://www.echonyc.com/~whitney/WMAA/mainmenu/mainmenu.html">Whitney</A> 

Biennial.  <p>



In hindsight, it seems unimaginable that Emmerich could have become 

anything but an art dealer.  His aunt and uncle, and before them his 

granduncle and grandfather, were art dealers in Paris; indeed, his 

grandfather sold J. P. Morgan much of his art collection, portions of which 

were ultimately received with gratitude by <A 

HREF="http://www.metmuseum.org/">New York's Metropolitan Museum.</A> In the 

1880s the granduncle and the grandfather decided to have a leading artist 

paint portraits of their daughters for posterity.  They considered 

commissioning Renoir, but settled on the then-eminent, staunchly 

respectable Louis Picard instead.  Emmerich, who spent much time in the 

house where the portraits hung, says, "I didn't want to make that mistake.  

I wanted to know the best art of my time."<p>



And yet his article for <i>The Atlantic Monthly </i>represents the continuation

of a second career: in his twenties Emmerich flirted with journalism, working

for <i>Time</i>, <i>Life</i>, the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>, and the

French magazine <i>R&eacute;alit&eacute;s </i>before returning to his roots. "I

consider myself a very lucky man," Emmerich says now. "Being an art dealer is a

wonderful combination of a business, a hobby, and a calling, all in one. When I

travel, of course I visit the museums and the galleries. And I always run into

other art dealers whom I know from other places, doing just what I'm doing.

None of us ever want to stop looking at art."   <p>--THE EDITORS<p>

		hree years ago, in light of the end of the Cold War, the Clinton 
Administration undertook a "fundamental reassessment" of America's 
national-security requirements. But after six months of analysis 
Administration officials concluded that the defense of U.S. global 
interests still demanded military spending of more than $1.3 trillion over 
the following five years and the permanent commitment of more than 200,000 
U.S. soldiers in East Asia and Europe--in other words, a strategy 
remarkably similar to that which America pursued during the Cold War. 
Moreover, rather than relinquish America's costly and risky 
responsibilities by dissolving Cold War alliances, defense strategists now 
plan to expand NATO's responsibilities eastward. Those who call for a more 
modest plan argue that U.S. strategy seems to be extravagance born of 
paranoia, or of the defense establishment's anxiety to protect its budget. 
In fact, given the way the makers of U.S. foreign policy have defined 
American interests since the late 1940s, these plans are quite prudent. 
And that is the problem. <p>

If many Americans had been asked ten years ago why U.S.  troops were 
deployed in East Asia and Europe, they would have answered, To keep the 
Soviets out.  They may have wondered, however, why the United States 
persisted in its strategy long after Japan, South Korea, and Western Europe 
had become capable of defending themselves.  Now that the USSR itself has 
disappeared, why does Washington continue to insist that U.S.  "leadership" 
in East Asia and Europe is still indispensable?<P> Ask National Security 
Council staff members, think-tank analysts, or State Department policy 
planners about America's globe-girdling security commitments and they will 
deliver very different answers--ones that have not changed in forty-five 
years.  They will justify the Pax Americana by invoking <A HREF="http://ksgwww.harvard.edu/~ksgpress/christop.htm">"the imperative of 
continued U.S.  world leadership,"</A> the need to "shape a favorable 
international environment," "reassurance of allies," and the ongoing need 
for "stability" and "continuing engagement." Even during the Cold War the 
"Soviet threat" might not have been mentioned.<P> The question that all 
this justification ignores is What, exactly, is "leadership," and why has 
it been the mantra of foreign-policy cognoscenti for nearly fifty years?  
What have we been doing around the globe, and why?<P> Most Americans 
misunderstand their country's foreign policy.  It seems to operate only 
when "danger" looms--when Iraq invades Kuwait, when Russian "imperialism" 
threatens to resurface, when China rattles its sabers at Taiwan.  Even 
people who religiously read the newspapers fail to grasp that U.S.  foreign 
policy is far more than simply a series of responses to crises.<P> For 
instance, media coverage of recurring tensions on the Korean Peninsula has 
focused on speculation about North Korea's nuclear program and the prospect 
of a new Korean war.  But when foreign-policy officials and experts discuss 
the Korean crisis among themselves, they rapidly leave the Koreas behind to 
focus on the real players in the region: China and Japan.  As far as 
national-security experts are concerned, almost any immediate crisis is 
subsumed by a larger threat--in this case no less than East Asia's role in 
the potential collapse of the international economy that U.S.  power has 
sustained since the late 1940s.<P> It's now an axiom of the U.S.  
foreign-policy establishment that economic, technological, and demographic 
changes are making East Asia the world's most dynamic arena, a driving 
force--increasingly the dominant force--in the international economy.  The 
Pacific Century, we are told ad nauseam, has dawned.  This transformation 
also means a shift in the international distribution of political and 
military power.  In a typical evaluation of East Asia's strategic future 
the foreign-policy expert <A 
HREF="http://www.wws.princeton.edu/faculty/friedberg.html">Aaron 
Friedberg</A> states darkly in the journal <I>International Security</I>, 
<P><blockquote> In the long run, it is Asia [rather than Europe] that seems 
far more likely to be the cockpit of great power conflict.  The half 
millennium during which Europe was the world's primary generator of war (as 
well as of wealth and knowledge) is coming to a close.  But, for better and 
for worse, Europe's past could be Asia's future.</blockquote><P> 
Friedberg's assertion nicely illustrates the ambivalence with which the 
U.S.  national-security community views East Asia's future.  He both 
prophesies an exhilarating Pacific Century and warns the West that the East 
may once again be up to no good.  <P> East Asia has never been a terribly 
successful field for American diplomacy.  There are undoubtedly many 
reasons for this, and surely that shortcoming for which the United States 
is continually indicted--cultural and historical myopia--has contributed 
enormously to its failures in the region.  Americans have always seen East 
Asia not for what it is but for what it can do to them or for them: the 
region is either danger or opportunity--either a new "ground war in Asia" 
or a new China market.  American understanding of Japan, for instance, is, 
in the words of the historian <A 
HREF="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~ksa/kascon/speakers/bc.htm">Bruce 
Cumings,</A> caught within the conflicting views of Japan as "miracle and 
menace, docile and aggressive, fragile blossom and Tokyo Rose." As 
Friedberg's analysis attests, the U.S.  foreign-policy community worries 
that the fragile blossom may again bloom into a Tokyo Rose.  <P> Pacific 
Century rhetoric usually describes the new era in a "post&#173;Cold War" 
context.  This is misleading, because it starts at the wrong place.  First, 
the shift of economic activity has not been sudden.  Even if East Asia rose 
in the American consciousness just as the Soviet Union receded, to define 
the economic and geopolitical transformation of East Asia as a 
post&#173;Cold War phenomenon Americanizes and trivializes a development in 
international (not American) politics of far greater impact than the Cold 
War itself.  Although Vietnam, China, and North Korea were for forty years 
able to contain America's Cold War ambition to "roll back" communism, they 
are proving utterly unable to contain the juggernaut of East Asia's 
capitalist political economy.  Most important, to imply that the end of the 
Cold War is of primary significance to U.S.  policy in East Asia is to 
wrench that policy out of its most important context and to distort its 
underlying aims and challenges.<P> What we think of as the Cold War was 
merely instrumental in America's larger "Cold War" strategy.  In "scaring 
hell out of the American people," as Senator Arthur Vandenberg said in 
1947, the U.S.-Soviet rivalry helped to secure domestic support for 
Washington's ambition to create a U.S.-dominated world order.  That same 
year one of Vandenberg's colleagues, <A HREF="../../../election/connection/
foreign/asiso.htm">the fervently anti-Communist Senator 
Robert Taft, expressed a strong suspicion that the supposed dangers to the 
nation from the USSR failed to explain America's new foreign policy.</a>  He 
complained that he was "more than a bit tired of having the Russian menace 
invoked as a reason for doing any--and every--thing that might or might not 
be desirable or necessary on its own merits." The former Secretary of State 
Dean Acheson put things in proper perspective: describing how Washington 
overcame domestic opposition to its internationalist policies in 1950, he 
recalled in 1954 that at that critical moment the crisis in Korea "came 
along and saved us."<P>


<br> <CENTER><b>Making the World <br> Safe for 
Capitalism</b><P> </CENTER> 

<font size=5> A</font> FUNDAMENTAL aim of 
America's Cold War strategy was to create and maintain what the former 
Secretary of State James Baker has called "a global liberal economic 
regime"--a capitalist world order. After the Second World War, American 
statesmen believed that the United States, standing alone and strong in a 
world of weary nations, had a remarkable opportunity, as Acheson said, to 
"grab hold of history and make it conform." American statesmen seized that 
opportunity by creating a complex strategy to reify Adam Smith's dream.  
Washington envisioned a world economy in which trade and capital would flow 
across national boundaries in response to the laws of comparative advantage 
and supply and demand--an economy in which production and finance would be 
integrated on a global scale.  The constricted national markets that were 
emerging in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War in Europe and 
East Asia would be combined, eliminating the inefficiencies of statism and 
self-sufficiency.  Large-scale regional economies would in turn be 
integrated into an interdependent world economy.  U.S.  policymakers knew 
that building this multinational capitalist community required the United 
States to provide Western Europe and Japan with enormous amounts of 
economic aid (through such schemes as the <A 
HREF="http://tesuque.cs.sandia.gov/~bbooth/docs/marshallplan.html">Marshall 
Plan,</A> for Europe, and the Dodge Plan, its equivalent for Japan), so 
that those areas would not retreat into closed economies.  They also knew 
that an open world economy demanded an even more ambitious American 
project: transforming international relations.<P> The greatest danger to 
U.S.  democracy and prosperity came, they believed, not from the Soviet 
Union but from Germany and Japan, whose potential strength amounted to a 
sort of Catch-22.  Without a flourishing international economy, Under 
Secretary of State Will Clayton warned in 1947, "our democratic free 
enterprise system" could not function.  As late as 1960 exports accounted 
for only 3.8 percent and imports for 4.8 percent of GDP.  The health of the 
international economy, in this disputable view, depended on Germany's and 
Japan's economic revitalization.  Germany, if its economy was resurrected, 
would once again be Europe's most efficient producer and most avid 
consumer.  Its very economic potential, however, made Germany a threat to 
the other Western European states, which, as the future Secretary of State 
John Foster Dulles explained to a closed Senate panel in 1949, were "afraid 
to bring that strong, powerful, highly concentrated group of people into 
unity with them." Similarly, as Dulles, Acheson, and other policymakers 
understood, a strong Japan was both necessary for a prosperous 
international order and intolerable to its neighbors.  The problem lay in 
the inherent contradiction between capitalism and international 
politics.<P> Capitalist economies prosper most when labor, technology, and 
capital are fluid, so that they are driven toward international integration 
and interdependence.  But whereas all states benefit absolutely in an open 
international economy, some states benefit more than others.  In the normal 
course of world politics, in which states are driven to compete for their 
security, the relative distribution of power is a country's principal 
concern, discouraging economic interdependence.  Thus 250 years ago the 
philosopher <A HREF="http://unix1.utm.edu/departments/phil/hume.html">David Hume</A> bemoaned the lack of economic cooperation among 
countries, blaming the "narrow malignity and envy of nations, which can 
never bear to see their neighbors thriving, but continually repine at any 
new efforts towards industry made by any other nation." In its efforts to 
ensure the distribution of power in its favor and at the expense of actual 
or potential rivals, a state will "nationalize"--that is, pursue autarkic 
policies, practicing capitalism only within its borders or among countries 
in a trading bloc.  This circumscribes both production factors and markets, 
and thereby fragments an international economy.  <P> A truly global economy 
is probably impossible to achieve.  In fact, as the Princeton political 
economist <A HREF="http://www.nbr.org/pub/analysis/vol2no1.htm">Robert Gilpin</A> has said, "what today we call international 
economic interdependence runs so counter to the great bulk of human 
experience that only extraordinary changes and novel circumstances could 
have led to its innovation and triumph over other means of economic 
exchange." Historically, to secure international capitalism a dominant 
power must guarantee the security of other states, so that they need not 
pursue autarkic policies or form trading blocs to improve their relative 
positions.  This suspension of international politics through hegemony has 
been the fundamental aim of U.S.  foreign policy since the 1940s.  The real 
story of that policy is not the thwarting of and triumph over the Soviet 
threat but the effort to impose an ambitious economic vision on a 
recalcitrant world.<P><br> <CENTER><B>Nurturing--and Constraining--<BR> the 
Fragile Blossom</b><P> </CENTER> <font size=5> T</font>HE overriding 
objective of U.S.  postwar policy toward East Asia was restoring Japanese 
economic power.  To be sure, this would help to immunize the region against 
Communist expansion; but Acheson and the other creators of the American 
Century thought the goal itself vital, regardless of the Soviet threat.  As 
the historians William Borden, Bruce Cumings, Ronald McGlothlen, and 
Michael Schaller have argued, in attempting to create a global economic 
system Washington pursued a course designed in essence to restore the 
Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere--imperial Japan's regional economy, 
which the United States had just destroyed in the Second World War.  If 
Japan was to help fuel the world economy, it would have to be, in Acheson's 
words, "the workshop of Asia." American postwar planners viewed the 
political economy that had developed in Northeast Asia from about 1900 to 
1945 as the region's natural economy--a tripartite system in which Japan, 
given access to continental markets and raw materials, formed the 
industrial core and its neighbors formed the economic semi-periphery and 
periphery.  As Japan advanced in the product cycle, climbing up the 
technological ladder, it spun off its low-technology and low-wage 
industries to its neighbors.  <P> In the late 1940s and the 1950s the 
United States essentially restored this system; but the machine could not 
run by itself.  Washington had to ensure that Japan's neighbors would feel 
secure politically in the regional hierarchy atop which Japan stood.  
Washington also had to ensure that the hierarchy did not develop--as it had 
in the past--into a Japanese-led closed economic bloc, which would threaten 
the world economy. <A HREF="http://www.worldmedia.com/archive/year/year-c02-s02.html">NSC 48,</A> the National Security Council's 1949 blueprint 
for America's Cold War strategy in East Asia, summed up the chief 
difficulty facing Washington's economic goals in the region--and around the 
globe.  Starting with the premise that "the economic life of the modern 
world is geared to expansion," requiring "the establishment of conditions 
favorable to the export of technology and capital and to a liberal trade 
policy throughout the world," NSC 48's authors went on to warn that "the 
complexity of international trade makes it well to bear in mind that such 
ephemeral matters as national pride and ambition can inhibit or prevent the 
necessary degree of international cooperation, or the development of a 
favorable atmosphere and conditions to promote economic expansion." <P> The 
distinguished historian and diplomat George Kennan, then the head of the 
State Department's policy-planning staff, saw only one solution to what he 
described as the "terrible dilemma" confronting U.S.  ambitions in East 
Asia.  Forty-seven years later Washington continues to pursue that 
course.<P><blockquote> You have the terrific problem of how then the 
Japanese are going to get along unless they reopen some sort of Empire 
toward the South.  Clearly we have got .  .  .  to achieve opening up of 
trade possibilities, commercial possibilities for Japan on a scale very far 
greater than anything Japan knew before.  It is a formidable task.  On the 
other hand, it seems to me absolutely inevitable that we must keep 
completely the maritime and air controls as a means .  .  .  of keeping 
control of the situation with respect to [the] Japanese in all 
eventualities.  .  .  .  [It is] all the more imperative that we retain the 
ability to control their situation by controlling the overseas sources of 
supply and the naval power and air power without which [Japan] cannot 
become again aggressive.  .  .  .<P> If we really in the Western world 
could work out controls, I suppose, adept enough and foolproof enough and 
cleverly enough exercised really to have power over what Japan imports in 
the way of oil and such other things as she has got to get from overseas, 
we would have veto power on what she does need in the military and 
industrial field.</blockquote><P> By providing for Japan's security and by 
enmeshing its foreign and military policies in a U.S.-controlled alliance, 
Americans have contained their erstwhile enemy, preventing their "partner" 
from embarking upon independent--and, so the thinking goes, 
dangerous--political and military policies.  <A HREF="http://www2.gol.com/users/johnrach/Chap2-1.html">By restraining its powerful 
ally,</A> Washington has, to use a euphemism favored in policymaking circles, 
"reassured" Japan's neighbors and stabilized relations among the states of 
East Asia.  The United States played the decisive role in promoting Tokyo's 
integration with its former colonies in Japan-centered regional trade 
networks that have been the foundation of East Asia's economic "miracle." 
South Korea and Taiwan, for example, overcame their fear and resentment of 
Japan and opened their doors to Japanese investment and trade.  <P> In a 
series of revealing interviews published in 1970 the former undersecretary 
of state Eugene Rostow was pressed to explain the motivations underlying 
U.S.  foreign policy generally and U.S.  policy toward Vietnam 
specifically.  In doing so he betrayed the lingering and profound distrust 
that U.S.  policymakers feel toward any powerful state that could play a 
role in world politics more independent than the one the United States has 
assigned to it.  At a time when America was involved in Southeast Asia 
ostensibly to draw a line against international communism, Rostow admitted, 
"I think the major concern--at least my major concern--in this miserable 
affair is the long-range impact a [U.S.] withdrawal would have on Japanese 
policy." He explained, "After the Japanese lost the war they reached 
certain conclusions, the principal one being that it was infinitely better 
to cooperate with the United States than to follow a hostile, militaristic 
line.  Now, it's greatly to our interest to have that judgment proved 
correct." If the United States abruptly pulled out of Vietnam, Rostow went 
on, "I think the Japanese will draw certain conclusions.  And I think their 
policy will take on a much more nationalistic cast.  .  .  .  I think the 
first thing that would happen would be that they wouldn't ratify the 
nuclear-non-proliferation treaty.  They would feel compelled to become a 
nuclear power." This would endanger the imperative that America preserve "a 
world of wide horizons in which we can move around and trade and travel on 
a large scale."<P><br> <CENTER><b>America as<BR> "Adult Supervisor"</b><P> 
</CENTER> <font size=5>A</font>MERICA'S Cold War policy is best understood 
not by its communism-containing words but by its ally-containing deeds.  
Washington committed itself to building and maintaining an international 
economic and political order based on what officials at the time termed a 
U.S.  "preponderance of power." By banishing power politics and nationalist 
rivalries, America's Cold War alliances in East Asia and Europe in effect 
protected the states of those regions from themselves.  <P> The United 
States has not subjugated colonies but, like Great Britain in the 
nineteenth century, has built and benefited economically from a stable 
international political order.  In this way Lenin was right: imperialism 
is, or allows for, "the highest stage of capitalism"--an open economy among 
the industrialized nations.<P> By building this global economy the United 
States has realized what Lenin called "[the German socialist Karl] 
Kautsky's silly little fable about ultraimperialism." In the celebrated 
debate between Lenin and Kautsky, Lenin held that any international 
capitalist order was inherently temporary, since the political order among 
competing states would shift over time.  Whereas Lenin argued that 
international capitalism thus could not transcend the Hobbesian reality of 
international politics, Kautsky maintained that capitalists were much too 
rational to destroy themselves in internecine conflicts.  An international 
class of enlightened capitalists, recognizing that international political 
and military competition would upset the orderly processes of world finance 
and trade, would instead seek peace, free trade, and the cooperative 
development of backward areas.<P> But Lenin and Kautsky were talking past 
each other, since Kautsky believed that the common interest of what he 
called the "inter-capitalist class" determined international relations, 
whereas in Lenin's analysis international relations were founded not in 
social classes but in competition among states.  Lenin argued that there 
was an irreconcilable contradiction between capitalism and the 
international system; Kautsky didn't recognize the division in the first 
place.<P> America's foreign policy has been based on a hybrid of Lenin's 
and Kautsky's analyses.  It has aimed at the unified, liberalized 
international capitalist community Kautsky envisioned.  But the global role 
that the United States has undertaken to sustain that community is 
determined by a worldview very close to Lenin's.  To Washington, Baker's 
"global liberal economic regime" cannot be maintained simply by an 
internationalized economic elite's desire for it to exist; it can be 
maintained only by American power.  Thus, in explaining its global strategy 
in 1993, in its "post&#173;Cold War" defense strategy, the Pentagon defined 
the creation of "a prosperous, largely democratic, market-oriented zone of 
peace and prosperity that encompasses more than two-thirds of the world's 
economy" as "perhaps our nation's most significant achievement since the 
Second World War"--not the victory over Moscow.  And it declared that this 
global capitalist order required the "stability" that only American 
"leadership" could provide.  Ultimately, of course, U.S.  policymakers and 
Lenin diverge.  Although Lenin recognized that any given international 
political order was by its nature impermanent, America's foreign-policy 
strategists have hoped to keep the reality of international politics 
permanently at bay.<P> Although the Cold War has ended, what National 
Security Advisor Anthony Lake calls the "imperative of continued U.S.  
world leadership"--as exercised, for instance, in America's dominance of 
its alliances in East Asia and of NATO--remains necessary to maintain a 
global economy.  The now-infamous draft of the Pentagon's defense plan, or 
the Defense Planning Guidance, which was leaked to <I>The New York 
Times</I> in 1992, gave the public an unprecedented glimpse of the thinking 
that informs Washington's security strategy, merely stating in somewhat 
undiplomatic language the logic behind America's Cold War strategy.  The 
United States, it argued, must continue to dominate the international 
system and thus "discourage" the "advanced industrial nations from 
challenging our leadership or .  .  .  even aspiring to a larger regional 
or global role." To accomplish this, America must do nothing less than 
"retain the pre-eminent responsibility for addressing .  .  .  those wrongs 
which threaten not only our interests, but those of our allies or friends, 
or which could seriously unsettle international relations." <P> The United 
States, in other words, must provide what one of the Planning Guidance's 
authors termed "adult supervision." It must not only dominate regions 
composed of wealthy and technologically sophisticated states but also take 
care of such nuisances as Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic, and North 
Korea's dictator Kim Jong Il, to protect the interests of virtually all 
potential great powers so that they need not acquire the capability to 
protect themselves--that is, so that those powers need not act like great 
powers.  Thus, for instance, Washington must protect Germany's and Japan's 
access to Persian Gulf oil, because if these countries were to protect 
their own interests in the Gulf, they would develop military forces capable 
of global "power projection." No wonder the United States must spend more 
on its "national security"than the rest of the world's countries combined.  
This post&#173;Cold War strategy reflects what the historian Melvyn Leffler 
defined as an imperative of America's Cold War national-security policy: 
that "neither an integrated Europe nor a united Germany nor an independent 
Japan must be permitted to emerge as a third force."<P> Only in this 
context can Washington's concerns regarding current developments in East 
Asia be properly understood.  For instance, in 1993 Alberto Coll, then a 
deputy assistant secretary of defense, clarified U.S.  aims in East Asia.  
"In the future," Coll declared in the <I>Washington Quarterly</I>, <P> the 
stability of the Pacific Basin and a strong US-Japanese relationship will 
be more important to the United States than ever before.  The US economy 
needs the vast markets of the Pacific Rim, and it benefits enormously from 
Japanese investment capital and technology and the impetus toward greater 
productivity provided by Japanese competition.  <P> All these benefits 
would be lost, according to Coll, if the "traditional rivalries among Asian 
powers .  .  .  unravel into unrestrained military competition, conflict 
and aggression." In the same vein the author of the Clinton 
Administration's security strategy for East Asia, Joseph Nye, then the 
assistant secretary of defense, asserted last year that the U.S.  military 
protectorate is "the basis for stability and prosperity in the region"; if 
the United States were to forsake its "leadership role" in East Asia, "the 
stable expectations of entrepreneurs and investors [would] be subverted." 
Although the United States committed forces to Japan ostensibly to protect 
it from the Soviets, and to South Korea to protect it from the North, in 
1993 the deputy defense secretary, William Perry (now the Secretary of 
Defense), declared that America would continue to reassure and stabilize 
East Asia by maintaining troops "permanently" in Japan and even in a future 
unified Korea.  <P><br> <CENTER><b>The Domino<br> Theory Revived</b><P> 
</CENTER> <font size=5>T</font>O Washington, East Asia is still composed of 
dominoes ready to fall.  "Renationalization," a term used by the 
cognoscenti to mean the resumption of international politics, could start 
virtually anywhere and spread rapidly.  In one of Aaron Friedberg's many 
nightmare scenarios one can almost hear the click of the falling dominoes: 
<P><blockquote> The nuclearization of Korea (North, South, or whether 
through reunification or competitive arms programs both together) could 
lead to a similar development in Japan, which might cause China to 
accelerate and expand its nuclear programs, which could then have an impact 
on the defense policies of Taiwan, India (and through it, Pakistan) and 
Russia (which would also be affected by events in Japan and Korea).  .  .  
.  similar shock waves could also travel through the system in different 
directions (for example, from India to China to Japan to 
Korea).</blockquote><P> Friedberg and other national-security analysts 
paint a similarly gloomy picture in Southeast Asia if, for example, Japan 
should undertake a military buildup in response to Korean reunification.  
Japan's reaction would alarm China--the emerging colossus, which U.S.  
defense planners now regard as the most serious potential long-term threat 
to America's global position.  China would speed up the development of its 
"power projection" forces.  This would alarm Korea, Taiwan, and Japan--and 
also Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam.  Their defensive response 
would further alarm China.  <P> Such developments, from Washington's 
perspective, would have one of two results, either of which would shatter 
the global economy: international anarchy, or regional dominance by China 
or Japan, which policymakers believe would lead inevitably to a regional 
trading bloc.  Arguing in 1992 for the maintenance of America's leadership 
of its Cold War alliances, a high-ranking Pentagon official asked, "If we 
pull out, who knows what nervousness will result?" The problem, of course, 
is that America can never know.  According to this logic, it must always 
stay.  <P> To the United States, the best change in East Asia is no change 
at all, because any alteration in the status quo could start the dominoes 
falling.  And if there is to be change, Washington--not Tokyo or 
Beijing--must manage it.  To permit otherwise would send a dangerous signal 
about America's diminishing ability to regulate, calibrate, and manipulate 
international politics in East Asia.  Of course, Washington appreciates 
that change is inevitable, and its frustration comes from being unable to 
square the circle--to manage an increasingly unmanageable world.<P> 
Although the United States remains committed to preserving the Pax 
Americana in East Asia, the states in the region see U.S.  influence 
inexorably declining, and they are planning accordingly.  South Korea, for 
example, is reorienting its military away from an emphasis on the threat 
from the North and toward projecting power against a future threat from 
Japan by means of naval and air forces, submarines, spy planes, and 
satellites.  The problem is that in prudently preparing for similar 
eventualities the East Asian states may indeed, as Washington fears, 
precipitate renationalization.<P> At a loss for what to do, U.S.  
policymakers propose two contradictory solutions.  On the assumption that 
democracies are inherently peaceful toward one another, one solution goes, 
the United States should tranquilize East Asia by democratizing it.  At the 
same time, the second solution has it, because only American dominance can 
ensure stability in the region (as in Europe), the United States should 
maintain its hegemony indefinitely.  Leaving aside the question of whether 
either goal can be achieved, it should be clear that proposing these 
solutions is as inconsistent as simultaneously asserting, as do most in the 
U.S.  national-security community, that although democracies pose no danger 
to other democracies, America must continue to contain Germany and 
Japan.<P> The hope and fear with which policymakers view economic change in 
East Asia illustrates the contradictory convictions that animate U.S.  
policy.  Washington both heralds the economic dynamism of the Pacific Rim, 
hoping it will bring democracy and peace and worldwide economic growth, and 
dreads the Asian miracle.  It knows that just as economic change engenders 
a shift in political and military power, so a particular economic order is 
jeopardized as the foundation upon which it rests--U.S.  hegemony--weakens.  
In the oxymoronic vocabulary of U.S.  diplomacy, strong "partners" are 
economically welcome and indeed necessary, but U.S.  "leadership" is 
indispensable.  Zbigniew Brzezinski, who developed the idea of a trilateral 
division of responsibility among the United States, Japan, and Europe, 
calls for Washington to develop "a more cooperative partnership" with Tokyo 
even as he asserts that America must continue to control Japan militarily.  
<P><br> <CENTER><b>Losing Ground</b> </CENTER><p> <font size=5>T</font>HERE 
is something at once poignant and obtuse in James Baker's comment that 
because President Clinton's foreign policy lacks consistency and firmness, 
"for the first time since the Second World War, Japan is not delivering an 
automatic vote for the US position." Sticking his head in the sand, the 
former Secretary of State claimed that such problems could be obviated "as 
long as America leads.  .  .  .  We have to lead." Japan's actions are 
certainly related to a decline in U.S.  leadership, but that decline is not 
the fault of what Baker would characterize as Clinton's weak foreign 
policy.  No matter who is in charge of U.S.  foreign policy, America is 
less and less able to lead.  Baker seems to have forgotten that America's 
leadership in the Gulf War was possible only because its allies agreed to 
pick up the tab.  Given such leadership, it is no surprise that 
once-subservient "partners" are increasingly going their own way.  
Preponderance cannot simply be asserted; it must reflect a position based 
on power.  When that position shifts enough, 
preponderance--"leadership"--is lost.  <P> Lenin argued seventy-eight years 
ago that international capitalism would be economically successful but, by 
growing in a world of competitive states, would plant the seeds of its own 
destruction.  Ironically, the worldwide economic system that the United 
States has fostered has itself largely determined America's relative 
decline even as it has contributed to the country's economic growth.  
Through trade, foreign investment, and the spread of technology and 
managerial expertise, economic power has diffused from the United States to 
new centers of growth, thus undermining American hegemony and ultimately 
jeopardizing the world economy.  <P> Nearly everyone applauds today's 
complex web of global trade, production, and finance as the highest stage 
of capitalism.  But international capitalism may be approaching a crisis 
just as it is reaching its fullest flower.  A genuinely interdependent 
world market is extraordinarily fragile.  The emergent high-technology 
industries, for instance, are the most powerful engines of world economic 
growth, but they require a level of specialization and a breadth of markets 
that are possible only in an integrated global economy.  As U.S.  hegemony 
continues to weaken, renationalized foreign and economic policies among the 
industrialized powers could fragment that economy.  <P> The future of a 
foreign policy designed to strengthen what the United States must contain 
and, at the same time, to maintain an economic order that weakens the very 
foundation of that order seems evident: it will collapse under the weight 
of its own contradictions.  The United States remains caught in the dilemma 
Kennan discerned more than forty years ago: "To what end 'security'?  For 
the continuation of our economic expansion?  But our economic expansion .  
.  .  cannot proceed much further without .  .  .  creating new problems of 
national security much more rapidly than we can ever hope to solve them." 
To escape this dilemma, Americans will have to understand the foreign 
policy that is conducted in their name and re-examine the requirements for 
their own security and prosperity.  </blockquote>

<blockquote>
	
	<font size=5>F</font>EBRUARY 1, 1979, was the most important day in the life of Mohsen Rafiqdoost.
On that day the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned to Iran by plane from a
fourteen-year exile imposed by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had left two
weeks earlier. Khomeini's plane arrived from Paris. The route from the airport
to downtown Tehran was lined with adoring millions. Rafiqdoost pulled his car
up to the plane. He was to be Khomeini's driver and the chief of Khomeini's
personal-security detail.<p>

"What kind of car was it?" I asked.<p>

Rafiqdoost's eyes flashed. His face exploded in a self-satisfied
grin. "A Chevy Blazer," he said. <p>

I met Rafiqdoost during a visit to Iran not long ago, and we spent more than
two hours talking in his <A HREF="http://tehran.stanford.edu/imagemap/tehran.html">Tehran</A> office. He seemed every bit the bodyguard.
Energy and aggression rippled from his compact, slightly stocky physique as he
sat on the edge of his chair, tapping his foot and banging his thigh with his
fist, and nodding his head whenever he had a point to make. Rafiqdoost has a
short salt-and-pepper beard and thin straight hair that is only now, in his mid-fifties, showing signs of receding. His profile is vaguely feral, in a way that 
makes him look menacing without making him ugly. His small, beetle-shell eyes 
radiate a playful dangerousness.<p>

During our meeting Rafiqdoost straddled the line between suave and sleazy. He
could almost have passed for a nightclub bouncer. He wore a designer-quality
striped shirt, a well-tailored black sports jacket, and gray slacks. His beard 
was neatly clipped. On his feet, though, were rubber beach thongs--a high-quality
brand like the kind sold in L. L. Bean catalogues. Rafiqdoost apologized for the 
thongs. "I forgot that a visitor was expected. They are more comfortable to work 
in."<p>

He was quite serious about the work. Around his desktop computer was a clutter
of notes and documents, upon which lay a pair of reading glasses with
fashionable frames. Iran, somewhat like Turkey, and unlike most places in the
Third World, is a place where office desks are used for real work rather than
merely for the display of petty bureaucratic power. The desk and the office
managed to be impressive nonetheless, with fashionable olive-gray chairs and a 
Sony television set.<p>

<br>
Rafiqdoost is definitely a man of parts, and a dynamic one at that--as talented
and dangerous with his computer as he is with his fists. That is why I wanted
to see him. For Rafiqdoost had not only been Khomeini's chief bodyguard. He
also played a key role in forming the Revolutionary Guards that brutally
crushed secular moderates and members of the leftist <A HREF="http://vislab-www.nps.navy.mil/~gmgoncal/mek.htm">Mojahedin-e Khalq</A>
(People's Holy Warriors), among other supposed enemies of the Islamic
Revolution. Rafiqdoost now controls something called the Bonyad-e Mostazafan
(Foundation of the Oppressed), Iran's largest holding company. The Bonyad is
made up of some 1,200 firms, and was established with money confiscated from
the Shah's family and from prominent industrialists who fled the revolution.
One Iranian, no fan of Rafiqdoost's, calls this foundation--ostensibly an
operation to help the poor--"the greatest cartel in history." Rafiqdoost is, in
all probability, worth tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.<p>

When I entered his office, he offered me his hand as if from a podium. He had
little modesty. He knew his importance.<p>
<pre>
</pre>

<font size=5>H</font>OW Rafiqdoost happened to be behind the wheel of that Chevy Blazer the day
Khomeini returned to Iran, how he took control of a substantial part of the
Shah's fortune, and how he converted that fortune into an even bigger financial
empire--these are things for which a Marxist would have a ready answer: they
are the result of Rafiqdoost's socio-economic class. In this case the Marxist 
would be right. Rafiqdoost is a <i>bazaari</i>, a member of the class of people 
who helped make the Iranian Revolution.<p>

Ironically, the Marxist probably never 
would have identified the <i>bazaaris</i> as a social class in the first place. 
This is because Marxists see classes only as they relate to the means of 
production, not as they actually function. As Nikki R. Keddi has pointed out, in 
<A HREF="http://tehran.stanford.edu/Iran_Lib/Literature/Book_Reviews/roots_of_revolution"><i>Roots of Revolution</i></A>, <i>bazaaris </i>don't fall into any of the usual 
categories.The worker in a hole-in-the-wall shop in the bazaar is certainly in a 
position different from that of a big moneylender in the bazaar. But both the 
laborer and the moneylender are <i>bazaaris</i>. They are both involved in petty 
trade of a traditional, or nearly traditional, kind, centered on the bazaar and 
its Islamic culture. At least, that has been the usual definition of <i>bazaari</i>. <p>

<i>Bazaar</i> is a Persian word that means "market." Westerners often use it
interchangeably with the Arabic word <i>souk</i> for markets throughout Muslim
North Africa and the Near East. The bazaar is often the first place tourists
head for, in order to lose themselves in serpentine alleys lined with shops,
sometimes built under picturesque archways--as in Tunis or Jerusalem--conjuring
up the clich&eacute; of the "fabulous East." Although Western goods are sold in
the bazaar, and <i>bazaaris</i> sell souvenirs to Western tourists and smile
before their cameras, real Westernization--supermarkets, department stores,
machine-made goods, large banks--threatens the <i>bazaari</i>'s livelihood. The smile
before the camera, therefore, is often a deceptive one.<p>

But <i>bazaaris</i> are not simply the men behind the stalls in the picturesque
Oriental market. According to a relatively new definition that has taken hold
among academics and journalists in the past few decades, <i>bazaaris</i> as a
social class can exist only in places where the society is in the midst of an
awkward modernization; where the bazaar is in some stage of transition between
the world of <A HREF="gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/56/1"><i>A Thousand and One Nights</i></A> and that of the suburban shopping
mall; where the welder's sparks singe the classic image of turbaned men
inhaling tobacco smoke from hubble-bubbles.<p>

<i>Bazaaris</i>, therefore, though age-old in the historical sense, are
relatively new in the political sense. The Muslim Brotherhood--the Ikhwan--in
Egypt is heavily backed by <i>bazaari </i>types. Although that organization, so
dangerous to pro-Western regimes in the Near East, consists largely of narrowly 
educated men of peasant background, it is the better-educated sons of traditional<i> 
bazaaris</i>, like Rafiqdoost, being a slight step up on the social ladder, who 
often lead the narrowly educated men in trying to topple an established order.<p>

In other words, <i>bazaaris</i> constitute a sort of newly established Islamic
petty bourgeoisie. They must compete with more-experienced Christian and Jewish
merchants, both in and outside the bazaar. This competition quickens the
<i>bazaaris'</i> resentments, which are often similar to those that were in
evidence among the petty bourgeoisie in Europe during the age of
industrialization.<p>

The Near East at the end of the twentieth century is, of course, a region in
great social turmoil and economic transition, as Europe was throughout the
nineteenth century and in the twentieth until the Second World War. <i>Bazaari
</i>types<i> </i>are increasingly significant politically, as the case of the
Muslim Brotherhood suggests. "Rafiqdoost," an Iranian friend explained, "is an
absolute <i>bazaari </i>through and through": a boy of the streets who learned
math with a scratch pad at his father's fruit stand. In the Muslim Near East,
especially in Iran, only a <i>bazaari</i> could assume the roles of both
bodyguard and financier.<p>

<pre>
</pre>

<font size=5>W</font>HAT has distinguished Iranian <i>bazaaris</i> from those in other
fast-changing societies in the Islamic world is their close links with the
clergy, or <i>ulama</i>, a relationship that developed during the nineteenth
century under the rule of the Qajar shahs. As Nikki Keddie writes,<p>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
Ulama and bazaaris often belonged to the same families; much ulama income came
from levies paid mainly by bazaaris; the guilds often celebrated religious or
partly religious ceremonies for which the services of ulama were needed; and
piety and religious observance were among the signs of bazaar standing or
leadership. (Even today respectable bazaar shopkeepers and moneylenders are
often addressed as "Hajji," whether or not the speaker knows if the addressee
has made a pilgrimage justifying this form of address.) Entry into the ulama
through study was an avenue of upward social mobility and entailed more respect
than entry into Qajar service. Mosques and shrines [located close to the
bazaar] were a major area of <i>bast</i> (refuge) for individuals and groups
that feared governmental arrest or harassment.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

But the <i>bazaari</i> looks at religion from a businessman's point of view. As
one Iranian acquaintance explained, "The <i>bazaari</i> is willing to bend the
rules of religion for the sake of finance." The so-called hypocrisy and corruption 
of the Iranian clergy sometimes stem from the <i>bazaari </i>backgrounds of many 
of the mullahs.<p>

"Describe a stereotypical <i>bazaari</i>," I asked a longtime foreign resident
of Tehran who speaks Persian. He answered, putting it in the form of a
caricature, "A <i>bazaari</i> is a fat guy with meaty hands and fingers like
kebabs, with gold rings on them. He sits in his shop and sips tea. He trades.
He makes a lot of money and he prays several times a day. He comes home at
night to a big, expensive house with nothing of taste in it, where he has a
wife who slaves for him."<p>

"Yes, I am a <i>bazaari </i> ," a vendor in the Tehran bazaar told me. "I buy and sell 
things."<p>

"In other words, you are a thief," interjected the vendor next to him,
laughing.<p>

Vahid, the son of a mullah in Tehran, told me, "A <i>bazaari</i> will say to
himself, 'I am a man of God who prays very often, so if I say that such and
such a carpet that I wish to sell to you is worth so-many rials, that is the true worth 
of the carpet, since a religious man like me would never lie.' Because the <i>bazaari</i>
is religious, he believes that he is always right." He went on, "The word 
for 'beard' in
Persian can be <i>pashm</i>, which also means 'wool.' The <i>bazaari</i>, while stroking 
his beard, will say to a customer regarding a carpet for sale, 'Yes, this is made
of very good wool.'"<p>

The bazaar where Rafiqdoost grew up is the quintessential bazaar in transition:
a labyrinthine world of corrugated iron roofs, brick archways, and plate glass
in the midst of a poor working-class region of South Tehran. It lacks any trace
of beauty--save for the eighteenth-century Imam Khomeini Mosque (formerly the
Shah Mosque) at its center--and is filled with every manner of goods, from
<i>chadors</i> and carpets to pots and pans to radios and television sets to
American candy bars.<p>

Rafiqdoost grew up as not just a <i>bazaari</i> but, more specifically, a
<i>meydani</i> ("person of the square"): someone who worked in the
fruit-and-vegetable market and therefore had few business connections with
Westerners or their companies--of the sort that, for example, a seller of
expensive carpets or electronic goods would have had. Yet Rafiqdoost's clan is
not unsophisticated: members of his extended family include doctors and
engineers. Rafiqdoost's brother used to run another of the handful of large
revolutionary foundations established with money confiscated from the Shah. <p>

"I was born in South Tehran, near the bazaar, to a very religious family close
to the Imam," Rafiqdoost told me. "I was always pro-Imam. I am a self-made
man. I was not allowed to enter university, because I was expelled from high
school in 1953, when I was thirteen, for pro-Mosaddeq activities. [Mohammad Mosaddeq 
was the Iranian Prime Minister who nationalized Western oil companies in 1951 and was 
subsequently overthrown in a 1953 coup organized, in part, by the Central Intelligence 
Agency.] Anti-Shah sentiment was something I learned in my home growing up. In 1976 I 
was jailed for political reasons. Four months before the revolution, in 1978, I was
released when the people stormed the prisons [as part of the series of
demonstrations that culminated in the Shah's downfall]. Immediately after
leaving prison I became a contact point for anti-regime people, and for distributing 
the Imam's decrees from Paris. I was also hiding people from the Shah's police. When 
the Imam decided to return to Iran, a revolutionary council was organized. I was given 
the task of logistics and personal security for the Imam. That's when I decided that I 
myself would be the Imam's driver." Though Rafiqdoost is not now known for violence, his 
past leadership of the violent Revolutionary Guards demonstrates to all in Iran his
capacity for it. <p>

I asked Rafiqdoost about the financial particulars of the Bonyad, the
Foundation of the Oppressed, whose 1,200 companies are involved in mining,
housing construction, transportation, hotels, and tourism. In 1993, Rafiqdoost
said, the Bonyad made a profit of 250 billion rials, or, in 1993 terms, roughly
$100 million. "The first part of our profits go for the victims of the Shah and
the wounded in the eight-year war with Iraq. The second part is for high schools in 
poor areas, for public-health clinics, for clothes for five hundred thousand needy 
students. The third part is for reinvesting."<p>

I did not doubt the foundation's commitment to the needy and the war wounded.
The amputee who operated the elevator that took me up to Rafiqdoost's office
was only one of a number of handicapped young men I saw working there. But the
Foundation of the Oppressed, as the largest holding company in an oil-producing
country of about 65 million people, has gargantuan amounts of real estate,
cash, and other assets. It is a state within a state. The foundation's
headquarters, where I met with Rafiqdoost, consists of three new office towers
of polished white stone; I had to pass through two heavily guarded checkpoints
in order to enter the complex. It was more impressive than any government
ministry I saw in Tehran.<p>

Were the amputees who were employed inside, along with the charity work and the
whole aura of do-goodism exemplified by the foundation's very name, merely 
fa&ccedil;ades--like the milk factory that was thought to be a cover for a 
chemical-weapons facility in Iraq? Was the foundation's emphasis on helping the 
"oppressed" the tactical equivalent of putting a terrorists' training facility near 
a school or hospital, as was done in Lebanon?<p>

I asked myself such cynical questions because the Foundation of the Oppressed
and other revolutionary foundations established with the Shah's money are
answerable only to the "Supreme Leader" of Iran, the Ayatollah Ali Khameneh'i,
to whose home Rafiqdoost says he goes to pray. Iran's elected President, Ali
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, has little control over the foundation's activities.
The ability of the Central Bank of Iran to tax the foundation, or to monitor
its foreign-currency flows--let alone audit its activities--is close to nil. In
the view of a Washington-based analyst, "Rafiqdoost is a New Age
<i>bazaari</i>, with few of the redeeming virtues of his forefathers. He is a
mobster-trader: a dark, rootless master monopolist." Who can say to what groups
in the Middle East and elsewhere Rafiqdoost may be sending checks? Rafiqdoost
and Khameneh'i can. Khameneh'i's photograph hangs in a large and ornate gold
frame in Rafiqdoost's office, next to a similarly framed photograph of Imam
Khomeini. Conspicuous by its absence is a picture of President Rafsanjani,
whose cabinet includes American-educated technocrats who for years have tried 
unsuccessfully, because of insufficient political clout, to move Iran closer to the 
West.<p>

But the possibility that Rafiqdoost is operating a financial and logistical
clearinghouse for international terrorism was less intriguing to me than the
possibility that the Foundation of the Oppressed represents a new kind of
economic organization in a new kind of emerging state. Such a state will be
well suited to the porous borders and the political chaos of the region. The
empire to Iran's north, the Soviet Union, has collapsed, bringing into
existence a collection of weakly governed fiefdoms in Central Asia; the state
to the east, Afghanistan, has disintegrated into landlocked emirates based on
drug trafficking; the state to the west, Iraq, an artificial construct of
European colonialism, is a veritable penitentiary facing eventual explosion and
possible collapse; and the state to the northwest, Turkey, is engaged in a
violent struggle between Turks and Kurds over the ethnic duality of its
Anatolian land mass.<p>

<pre>
</pre>

<font size=5>M</font>IGHT the most enduring legacy of the Islamic Revolution be the <i>bazaari
</i>nature of the Iranian economy? The <i>bazaaris</i> have created a political
and economic system that is a larger version of the South Tehran bazaar. The
Bonyad and the other foundations are expanded versions of the wholesalers and
retailers with whom small shopkeepers are not in a position to compete, because
they can't afford the bribes and don't have the connections. The alliance
between <i>bazaaris</i> and clergy now exists at a higher level too. As in the
bazaar, the rules are far more flexible and contradictory than those that any
nation-state system familiar to a Westerner would ever tolerate. Some
enterprises may import and export dollars; some may not. Some can do it at this
rate of exchange; others must do it at that rate of exchange.<p>
 
The ancient and informal roadside-banking system in Iran is often more reliable
than the official banking system, where one might deposit money today and find
that it can't be withdrawn tomorrow, unless the teller is bribed. Huge profits
are being hidden and spent on who knows what. But that doesn't mean the poor
have been forgotten. Like traditional <i>bazaaris</i>, all the corporate
<i>bazaaris</i> give alms. (I didn't see more than a few beggars during an
entire month in Iran.) Rafiqdoost, I mean to suggest, is still the fruit
seller. He goes over his books with a computer rather than a scratch pad. As a
devout Muslim, he gives a generous portion of his proceeds to the needy. He
deals with the authorities on an informal after-hours basis. Here is a murky cosmos 
of deals and mutual favors for which written laws have yet to be drafted.<p>

The bazaar isn't so much filling a void in post-revolutionary Iran as it is defining 
the chaos. The most telling fact about the Iran of the mid-1990s is that the system 
of competing power centers bequeathed by the revolution is breaking down, and yet 
nothing, and no one, is even remotely on the horizon to serve as a replacement. The 
monarchy, an institution with which Iranians had a troubled history long before the Shah,
has been discredited. The military is possibly too deeply divided to take back power. 
As for democracy, the freely elected parliament is merely a venue for factionalism and 
attacks against the government. True, the present ruling coalition of radical mullahs 
and the security services could fissure, leaving the parliament and the presidential
cabinet in control. Such a development would hardly bring stability. And if, as
is more likely in the short run, the power of the mullahs under Ali Khameneh'i
increases, then so will the influence of the <i>bazaaris</i>, and of their way
of doing things. But there are limits to how much even this regime can get away
with. If any recent event demonstrates the fragility of Iran's quickly
ossifying revolutionary system, it is the conviction late last year of eight
businessmen closely connected with the ruling clerics, including Rafiqdoost's
brother, Morteza, on charges of stealing and embezzling as much as $400
million. The public outcry made it impossible for the regime to protect even
its own moneymen. One of the eight was hanged, and Rafiqdoost's brother got a
life sentence. Rafiqdoost himself was sufficiently threatened that Ali
Khameneh'i had to reaffirm him publicly as the head of the Foundation of the
Oppressed.<p>

Nevertheless, while observing and listening to Rafiqdoost, I wondered, Might
this be normality? Might this be <i>it </i> ? Might <A HREF="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~naghsh/iran.html">Iran</A> constitute a culture
that is too urbane and sophisticated for a one-man thugocracy like the ones that 
obtain next door in Iraq and Syria, yet not sophisticated enough for a reasonably 
functioning and stable democracy? Is Iran--like so many other entities in the 
Middle East and Central Asia--evolving into something neither authoritarian nor 
democratic nor even organized the way a state is ordinarily thought to be? I could not 
escape the conviction that the twenty-first century will see the implosion of political 
Islam and the rise of the Islamic bazaar state.

<blockquote>

	

	<font size=5>W</font>ITH its gentle, misty climate, Britain has been welcoming

	 gardeners for many centuries. Although the island has only a narrow range of

	  native flora (the Ice Age left it quite barren), it's famous for pampering vegetative invaders. In

the first century A.D. the Romans planted vineyards, avenues of chestnut trees,

and rows of cabbages (who would have thought cabbage had ever been anything but

English?). The transplants thrived. Every era since has added to a history rich

in horticulture, with medieval monastic herb gardens, with exotic plants

brought home in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries from expeditions to

all parts of the globe, with the latest sweetly scented, disease-resistant

hybrids from the contemporary rose breeder David Austin.<p>

 

Gardening is the national art form, you might say. Whether in window boxes or

on the back forty, more than 80 percent of all British households scratch the

earth. Because the English understand, perhaps better than any other

nationality, that lovely gardens deserve audiences, they are the creators of

the National Gardens Scheme, in which some 3,500 private English and Welsh

gardens are opened to the public each year, on given days or by appointment.

Descriptions of the gardens, open dates, and directions are given in the NGS's

Yellow Book, a paperback guide that regularly sells clean off bookstore shelves

within a few weeks of its annual publication, in March. The Yellow Book can be

ordered from the NGS, Hatchlands Park, East Clandon, Guildford, Surrey GU4 7RT,

United Kingdom (send a check for $18). Entrance fees are around &#163 1.50 ($2.30) per garden; the proceeds benefit various charities;

tea is usually served.<p>



What better way to get to know another people, I thought, than to join them at

their favorite pastime? (I'd already visited many of the historic English

estates, often a diminishing experience for the heritage-challenged American.)

So last summer I made a tour of more than two dozen Yellow Book gardens, seeing

some by myself and others with my friend Hope, a fellow New England gardener.

On a blustery day last March, with a map of the UK spread out on my kitchen

table, Hope and I charted a wide circular course through the Home Counties--the

ones bordering greater London.<p>



To pore over the Yellow Book in the chill of winter is to wallow in temptation.

Each garden listed has been vetted by the NGS County Organizers and is said to

offer at least forty-five minutes' worth of green interest. How were we to

choose among "Tudor house with pond and cottage garden, Gertrude Jekyll water

garden, pergola," "connections with Jane Austen who stayed here," "original

Lutyens' design, herbaceous borders, ilex walk, avenues of limes," and

"sub-tropical garden containing gingers, cannas, tree ferns, bananas, bamboos,

on urban plot 40 by 20 feet"?<p>



Coordinating the limited and seemingly random open days required studious

cross-checking and slavish scrutiny of the map ("Are we looking for the Old

Rectory near Maidstone, Kent, or the one near Maidenhead, Berkshire?" "Never

mind--they're both closed in late June"). Fortunately, there's also the "By

appointment" option for many gardens. To book rooms for each night, we flipped

through Elizabeth and Walter Gundrey's <i>Staying Off the Beaten Track</i> and

the current Wolsey Lodges brochure. (Wolsey Lodges are private homes belonging

to gentry who take in paying guests--in order, one assumes, to offset Lloyd's

losses or contribute to boarding-school tuitions.) The brochure is available

from Wolsey Lodges, 17 Chapel Street, Bildeston, Suffolk IP7 7EP. Ultimately we

wrote to or telephoned a dozen garden owners to ask permission to visit on days

that coincided with open days for other gardens in the area. <p>

<pre>



</pre>







<font size=5>W</font>E were welcomed warmly by all--although cautioned by Lady Heald. The

ninety-year-old widow of Sir Lionel, Winston Churchill's attorney general in

the fifties, warned us that her fields would be dreadfully trampled by the

annual convention of Shelties that weekend. Did we mind? No. Not at all.<p>



When the June afternoon arrived, Lady Heald escorted us personally along the

walled terraces of Chilworth Manor; these had been laid out in 1720 by Sarah,

Duchess of Marlborough. Regiments of tall scarlet penstemons with long tubular

flowers filled the borders, a few blowzy pink peonies nodding and flirting

within the ranks. These formal beds were clearly the hired gardener's domain,

as were the lush plantings around eleventh-century stewponds, where monks once

fattened fish for their table. But Lady Heald herself hadn't been able to

resist domesticating the banks of a brook trickling through a boggy woodland

below the garden. "Do come see my lovely ferns," she urged, and then she

identified each filigreed one of them for us.<p>



Snowy-haired and erect, our hostess tapped her cane against the trunk of a

forty-three-year-old catalpa, the handsome Indian bean tree with skinny pods

and heart-shaped leaves. "After the coronation and reception," she told us, "my

husband and I toasted the young Queen's health, and then buried the champagne

bottles right here with the program and menu rolled inside. Years from now,

when the tree dies, I daresay those bottles will be auctioned off at

Christie's."<p>



Did we know, incidentally, of any American film companies that might want to

lease a manor house or a garden in Surrey for a movie set? When she inquired

hopefully about our Hollywood connections, Lady Heald was cutting thick slices

of sweet, sticky cake for tea. Alas, we were useless. Eyeing us suspiciously,

James, the half-blind fourteen-year-old Jack Russell terrier, waited for his

own generous hunk of cake, which Lady Heald dumped unceremoniously on the

bottom shelf of the tea cart.<p>



Many of the more ancient properties we saw appeared to be struggling, albeit

imaginatively, under the burden of Britain's whopping inheritance taxes. The

aura of decay hangs especially heavily on the houses and outbuildings. We saw

orangeries in ruins and Edwardian greenhouses empty because of the high cost of

heat. But where the kitchen gardens had been abandoned and the elaborate

planting schemes scaled back, the charm of fraying grandeur still beguiled

us.<p>



Somehow our &#163 4 donation to the National Gardens Scheme felt measly

in comparison with the gracious introduction we were given to Chilworth Manor.

The &#163 1.6 million that the scheme netted last year was divided among

seven national causes and numerous pet charities named by individual garden

owners, including the Horses and Ponies Protection Association, the West

Berkshire Marriage Guidance Trust, and the Church Fabric Fund. What a sensible

arrangement--you have a look around a garden you would not ordinarily have

access to, and your money goes to a good cause. <p>



Actually, my visit to St. Paul's Walden Bury, a formal woodland landscape

designed in 1730, left me wondering where my money would end up. On the morning

I visited (Hope had not yet joined me), a mist was rising from the beech-lined

avenues that fan out into the Hertfordshire countryside, twenty-five miles

north of London. From the imposing eighteenth-century brick house, which has

belonged to the Bowes Lyon family for 250 years, long all&eacute;es run north,

one centered on the village church in the far distance and two others

highlighting impressive statues of legendary Greeks: the goddess Diana with her

quiver of arrows and a curly-haired Hercules.<p>



At the time St. Paul's Walden Bury was designed, fashion dictated symmetry,

rigid patterns, intersecting straight lines, perfectly circular pools. By the

second half of the eighteenth century, however, these ideals were being edged

out by a growing passion for wilderness, the renowned landscape architect

Capability Brown being the great proponent of informal, natural-looking

landscapes. With its towering wild oak woods littered with classical elements,

St. Paul's Walden Bury refuses to fit neatly into a single school of landscape

design and happily embraces both strict geometry and nature at its freest.<p>



Not another visitor tramped the long grassy walks between clipped twelve-foot

hedges, the stately avenue of lime trees, or the shady paths winding through

rhododendron glens. Without a plan of the forty-acre property, I came upon each

garden feature with surprise: a small octagonal pavilion; a Greek temple; stone

sphinxes with faces that, I later learned, were modeled after the mistresses of

Louis XV. On the bank of a neglected pond a duck had nested on a stone cherub

riding a swan. Deeper in the woods a flock of startled white pigeons flapped up

frantically from the trees.<p>



The house, too, seemed deserted. Mildly interested in finding the honesty box

for my admission fee ("Just make your own change, dearie," I'd been told on the

phone), I paused to peer through a high, intricate wrought-iron gate off the

main entrance. An elderly woman dressed in a flowered shirt, pedal pushers, and

sneakers was leaning out of a golf cart to yank weeds from a flower bed. Then

she moved to another spot, jabbed her cane in the dirt, and began yanking weeds

again. Catching sight of me, she shouted over the din of three tiny yapping

dogs, "Come in--come right in. What a pretty skirt. Now, can you tell me what

this is, this pale apricot one just unfolding? A friend from Northumberland

gave it to me, and it's never bloomed before."<p>



It was a poppy (I didn't know what kind), the delicate crepe-paper petals

almost transparent in the sun. A cloak of pink roses clung to the garden walls.

Blue mounds of hardy geraniums, violets, twitching mauve poppy heads, spikes of

purple salvia, spires of creamy foxglove, and the messy froth of lady's

mantles' tiny lime-yellow flowers all crowded one another amiably--long, bright

borders that the woman insisted I survey.<p>



Reading the family history later, I realized that the spirited gardener in the

golf cart was the Dowager Lady Bowes Lyon, the Queen's aunt. And it was she who

breezily relieved me of my entrance fee and then some. I gave her a &#163 10 note and never did get any change.<p>



<pre>



</pre>

<font size=5>L</font>ONDON imposed challenges in getting to Yellow Book gardens. Because it was

summer, many Londoners were out of town, their garden gates locked.

Furthermore, having given up our rental car, Hope and I were making our way

around the city on foot. It was, in fact, geography that led us to discover

Shirley and David Nicholson's tiny colorful haven, just north of Holland Park.

With twenty gardens in our wake, we needed to jump-start our enthusiasm on that

first, scorching day of July. "Let's see, phlox are the specialty [we read from

the book]--hmm, didn't even know there were more than twenty-five varieties.

Well, it's only two blocks away."<p>



The garden is approached through the French doors of the dining room; these

open onto a wrought-iron balcony, from which a circular staircase winds

gracefully down to a narrow band of paved terrace. A venerable old pear tree

reaching for the sun creates a green canopy above a small round table and four

white chairs. From here the trellised and brick-walled garden extends back like

a shoe box overflowing with lush vines and lovely masses of blossoms. <p>



Clearly, this was a plantsman's garden, in which every vigorous leaf and fat

bud was delighted with its lot in life. And there was another aesthetic at work

too. We were not only drawn into this welcoming space but also immediately

hooked by a lively color-and-light show. From a throw rug of grass next to the

terrace we took in the tangle of deep-pink clematis and roses strangling the

wall, inky-blue monkshood standing tall in the back border, cushions of silver

hosta tucked farther away in deep shade, and magenta cranesbill flopping over

the retaining wall at our feet. Each visual dance through the garden revealed a

dozen new plants, a master's hand manipulating our attention. It came as no

surprise to learn that Shirley Nicholson, our soft-spoken, Latin-spewing

hostess and guide, had been trained as an architect and is the author of a

National Trust garden book.<p>



It seemed appropriate that the exquisite little plot should reflect, in

miniature, the organizing principles that the architect Edwin Lutyens and the

garden designer Gertrude Jekyll established in their gardens. For those grand

affairs, created before the First World War, Lutyens laid out formal

foundations and then Jekyll ran over them with galloping arrangements of

plants. The Nicholsons' flowers, too, spilled from raised beds edged severely

in stone. Honeysuckle, passionflower, and climbing nightshade draped themselves

luxuriantly on trellises to mask the rigidity of tall parallel walls. Even the

architectural lines of an outbuilding were blurred under a patched quilt of

grape, clematis, and ivy.<p>



Prowling through beautiful gardens is more fun if the people who shape them are

on the scene, Hope and I concluded. But even when the owners weren't there to

introduce us to Venus' fishing rod, dipping its blue-violet flowers, or to

explain the mechanics of a homemade sweet-pea frame, we thought we could detect

something of their personalities; the Yellow Book gardens feel lived in.

Regrettably, the geniuses behind Sissinghurst Castle, Hixdcote Manor, and

Hampton Court Palace are long gone. Those gardens are, nevertheless, not to be

missed. But if you're longing for an intimate look at living art, pick up a

Yellow Book. Wander among the English in their most sensible shoes and

comfortable clothes.

	<font size=5>T</font>HE best response to a story being another story, I

can't resist the temptation to begin talking about this anthology by telling a

few tales of my own.<p>



Once upon a time my father, a less than modestly successful businessman, came

home from work. That's it. That's the end of the first story. He lost his job

and did not go back to work for a long time, no matter how hard he tried to

find another job. What sometimes happens happened next: he declared bankruptcy,

and eventually he and my mother divorced. There's no moral at the end of that

story either--only my life, which continued unpredictably and incalculably (as

did my parents' lives).<p>



I'd always been a reader, but at around the time my father became unemployed,

when I was sixteen, I turned more purposefully to books--especially fiction,

poetry, and drama. That good, bad, glad, sad, mad Hamlet; helpless, murderous

Raskolnikov; Cordelia, so absolutely right and so absolutely wrong; haughty,

vulnerable Darcy; monstrous, pathetic Ahab; poor, weak, stupid, heartbreaking

Hurstwood! Unlike my father's bankruptcy and my parents' divorce, the incidents

in those characters' lives never stood humiliatingly alone, trapped behind the

bars of monotone facts. I read about situations and personalities, words and

gestures, that rose up into the imagination on layers of meaning--so many

layers that all these overlapping meanings could cushion a guy when he bounced

off the hard rock of social reality and started falling. Art imprismed me in

its extenuating colors, and the multiplicity of truth--of morals to be

drawn--set me free.  <p>



I went off to college after that, and the first semester there I found myself

in a course on nineteenth-century European philosophy, taught by a Professor

Bridges. There were mostly working-class kids at this school, kids who, like

me, wore their best clothes self-consciously and glowingly to class. Bridges

himself strode into the room on the first day in a flannel shirt, jeans, and

work boots, and delivered the news (this took place fifteen years ago) that he

stood for radical change, in the tradition of Marx and Engels, Lenin and

Trotsky. That was fine with me. So long as the revolution had room for people

in nice shirts and pants, I would be there. I excitedly prepared to listen to

Professor Bridges blow a hole in the hard social facts, the way my favorite

authors did. <p>



But that's not what happened. Professor Bridges just kept bouncing our heads

off the hard social facts. Bourgeois art--and he considered all "high" art

bourgeois art--lied, deceived, oppressed, and betrayed. It offered a way out as

a way of keeping us in the system. It did not accurately reflect the forces

that crush, as art must always do; rather, its multiple meanings smothered the

impulse toward concrete collective action. Bridges was cruder (and more

casually dressed) than other supposedly radical professors I encountered when,

years later, I attended graduate school in a tonier academic setting. But his

crudeness was just the thing to overrun my defenses. I began to hate my bookish

ambitions, and to hate the telltale formality of my clothes. He stripped me

bare inside and out, and I sat there shaking with the shame and anger I'd felt

when my father lost his job. <p>



Since then, as American politics has moved to the right, I've dug in my heels

left of center. And as the culture has moved to the left, I've . . . well,

let's just say that I've stuck to "high" art and to its saving

complexities--those complexities that are neither liberal nor conservative. Two

years ago I reviewed William Bennett's <i>The Book of Virtues</i> for <i>The

Nation</i> and tried to give Bennett a good taste of his own scourge. My

father's experience led me to respond caustically to all that cruel blather

about lack of character being a more fundamental social reality than social

arrangements themselves. And yet no one had screwed things up like my father.

Thus, entangled like Laoco&ouml;n in those layers of meaning, I read through

this new moral anthology, edited by the progressive educators Colin Greer and

Herbert Kohl--a volume described by its publisher as the "liberal alternative

to the bestseller <i>The Book of Virtues</i>"--and began to recall Professor

Bridges. <p>

<pre>



</pre>

<font size=5>I</font>N purpose the two anthologies are decidedly similar. Both contain stories,

poems, and essays meant to be read aloud by parents, so as to facilitate the

moral education of children during their pre-adolescent years--though Bennett

thoughtfully adds that he has included some difficult material for children to

read as they grow older. Bennett's goal is "to help children achieve . . .

moral literacy." Greer and Kohl aim to "encourage young people to read, talk

and think about moral issues." In both books editorial commentary highlights

the various moral messages that the authors intend their selections to

illuminate.<p>

Open these two big books to their tables of contents, however, and they begin

to split apart like the primal elements. Bennett divides his anthology into ten

sections that cover the moral "field," as he puts it, from self-discipline to

faith. Greer and Kohl weigh in with sixteen sections, from courage to love, the

sections themselves sorted under four main headings: "Values That Relate to

One's Self," "Values That Relate to People One Knows," "Values That Relate to

People One Doesn't Know and Nature," "Values That Relate to Love." The two

anthologies share six values: self-discipline, compassion, responsibility,

courage, loyalty, and honesty. Bennett has four that didn't make it into Greer

and Kohl's volume: friendship, work, perseverance, and faith. Greer and Kohl

have a whopping ten that Bennett never thought of: integrity, creativity,

playfulness, generosity, empathy, adaptability, idealism, balance, fairness,

and love. <p>



You know that when you have "work" in a volume without "playfulness," and

"playfulness" in a volume without "work," you're looking at a genuine

difference of opinion. But the gulf between <i>The Book of Virtues</i> and <i>A

Call to Character</i> is at its widest when it comes to the values they share.

Take the booming introduction to "responsibility" in Bennett: "Responsible

persons are mature people who have taken charge of themselves and their

conduct, who <i>own</i> their actions and <i>own up</i> to them--who

<i>answer</i> for them." Here are the multiculturally sensitive Greer and Kohl

on responsibility--after having specified that they compiled this anthology for

children aged eight to thirteen:<p>

<blockquote>

Responsibility is . . . a readiness to step forward as needed, a capacity to

make sound preparations for certain and uncertain prospects. . . . This means

paying attention, because it is inattention to the hurt, which can be caused by

thoughtless habit and ill-considered convention, that produces so much ill will

and conflict between people. </blockquote>



In the former you hear the deadly yin of defunct entitlements, in the latter

the pedantic yang of the condescending group leader. Both visions of character

are essentially public visions with public aims--character as a vehicle for

social change. <p>

<pre>



</pre>



<font size=5>O</font>NE person's concept of responsibility has often been another person's

burden, and fine sentiments won't pay your health insurance. God loves the poor

and helps the rich, as my paternal grandmother told me when I once asked her

why she didn't lend my father money. But I marvel at how there can be such a

chasm in this country over the idea of <I>character</I>, with

liberals on one side and conservatives on the other. It speaks of an

intellectual hatred between the two sides, and as Yeats wrote in "A Prayer for

My Daughter," "An intellectual hatred is the worst."<p>

I don't think of character as a public issue. The public issues that rend

America are, for the most part, insoluble conflicts, beyond the art of

compromise. You can't have capital punishment and not have capital punishment,

have gun control and not have gun control; a fetus cannot be a little bit

aborted. In public conflicts one side or the other always gains the upper hand.

But civil society depends on people who, once outside the political realm, know

how to abstain from demanding victory, how to embrace contradictions with

Whitmanesque ardor. Unlike the capacity to choose sides in a conflict, the

ability to live amid contradictions requires character. And the first step

toward character is the capacity to build solitude out of loneliness, to learn

how to be alone with yourself.  <p>



Greer and Kohl stand for what used to be proudly called the liberal agenda. If

I were a parent--and my wife and I hope to be parents someday--I would want my

children to learn the importance of taking and acting on a public stand, and on

most issues I'd want them to stand beside Greer and Kohl. But when the rally

was over, the chanting done, the sun setting, and my children all alone, I

would want them to have good old-fashioned inner resources--for their sake, and

for the sake of their society. I would want them to know and accept life's

crepuscularity. I would not give them treats or favors or hugs or kisses unless

they repeated after me, every morning and every night: Life is not this thing

or that thing, or one thing or another thing! Life, to put it not so simply, is

life. <p>



So I would want my children to be able to pull themselves up by their own

bootstraps, but never to assume that everyone else is able to do the same. I

would want them to see truth sometimes as social handiwork but sometimes as an

absolute. I would want them seldom to spare themselves the rod, but to go ahead

and spoil the poor and the vulnerable. I would want them to care deeply,

creatively, playfully, generously, empathetically, idealistically, about the

people and the wider world around them, but I would want them to survive. And I

would want them to flourish. But above all, I would want them to know that the

future offers more than two opposing courses of possible public conduct; I

would want them to live intensely through life's paradoxes and ambiguities. "If

goodnesse leade him not," George Herbert has God concluding about his volatile

creation, "yet wearinesse may tosse him to my breast." <p>



Among other things, art and literature humanize us into enduring life's

paradoxes and ambiguities, its setbacks, calamities, and disappointments. They

teach us to be alone with ourselves, so that we might grasp our "own inborn

strength," as Conrad called it, which enables us to endure what we have to

endure without sacrificing identity to survival. That is character. Yet--irony

of ironies--here are Bennett, Greer, and Kohl screwing a utilitarian handle

onto the imagination, abusing the very faculty that most makes character

possible. <p>



No child is going to nourish character out of life's twilit nooks and crannies

from reading either the conservative anthology of virtue or this recent liberal

one. If these two books were all they had, kids would have to choose between

Chaucer on the one hand and Langston Hughes on the other. They would find John

Donne and Lord Tennyson facing off with Derek Walcott and Seamus Heaney; Plato,

Aristotle, and Emerson versus Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and Gandhi; the Grimm

brothers' tales versus E. Nesbit's enchanting dragon stories; Goethe and

Tolstoy versus Denise Levertov and Luisa Valenzuela; the Book of Exodus versus

Lewis Carroll. It's as if in the deepest, most luscious and mysterious folds of

the imagination, children were to find an administrative aide insisting that

they sign up for either Mr. Bennett's homeroom ("Wow, what's his problem?") or

Mr. Greerkohl's ("Yuck, he's always smiling"). <p>



Greer and Kohl are paragons of character; they know the pitfalls of their

enterprise, yet they press on. One of the many worthwhile books that Kohl has

written, <i>Thirty-Six Children</i>, is a marvelous, impassioned account of his

experience teaching in a Harlem public school in the sixties, and I suspect

that much of the passion and the commitment in this anthology come from him.

<i>A Call to Character</i> cautions wisely and sincerely about respecting

children's "complex inner lives," carefully emphasizes how "wonderful and

complicated" children are, and talks about the importance of avoiding

"preaching or didactic teaching" when raising "issues of concern" with

children.  <p>



But the authors do protest too much. Once you start using stories to discuss

"issues of concern," you begin taking the edge off that wonderfully complex

inwardness--especially when you know exactly where you're headed: "A grounded

understanding of social character values such as loyalty, honesty, and empathy

can evolve through the conversations that reading stories makes possible." But

what if a kid doesn't want to have a moral talk about what she's read? What if

she reads a story chosen to illustrate empathy but remains stubbornly convinced

that it's about the complicated inner life of a hedgehog named Georgina? Does

she get a dunce cap? A show-and-tell trial?   <p>



Because Kohl and Greer are sensitive to the potential for impertinent readings,

they've taken no chances. And because they take no chances, a better title for

their anthology would have been <i>Thirty-Six Robots</i>. Like Bennett, they

introduce their selections with little prefaces meant to isolate the moral

meaning under consideration. And like Bennett's, these prefaces rarely have

anything to do with the literary works they precede. Typical is the preface

introducing an excerpt from <i>Death of a Salesman</i>, which warns, "If, like

those of Willy Loman's sons, our unexamined prejudices get in the way, we can

end up disconnected from others." Yet Arthur Miller's heart-wrenching play

<i>is not about unexamined prejudices</i>. And Willy Loman's epitaph is not

"Here Lies a Man Who Was Disconnected." But all that is moot, since Greer and

Kohl's excerpt is from the scene where Willy begs his former boss's son to keep

him on the job--a scene that doesn't even have Willy's sons in it. Throughout

the anthology the contrast between the authors' prefaces and the selections

themselves is nerve-wracking: it's the difference between a more perfectly

ordered world as shiny as a new pair of shoes, and that precious, dirty,

fraying old pair of sneakers (one of which lies hidden in shadows under the

bed) that poets call the human heart.<p>

<pre>



</pre>



<font size=5>B</font>AD as this is, what is most surprising is <i>A Call to Character</i>'s deep

disrespect for the act of storytelling itself. Greer and Kohl speak

impressively about "the power of stories to bind adults and children and teach

in depth and with love." But they are so zealously open to their vision of

stories as vessels of social change that they are closed to their stories' and

poems' openness. Gouging brief selections out of longer works, they succeed in

destroying any magic or charm that might shield their choices from their

intentions. Excerpts begin bewilderingly, without any adaptation or background

explanation, and stop the reader dead in his tracks. <p>



What is anyone, let alone a child, to make of a single page from <i>Northanger

Abbey</i>? Eight paragraphs from the complicated finale of <i>Invisible

Man</i>? Three paragraphs from <i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i> (moral: "Deep

pleasure can come in prized pursuits")? The answer is that readers are not

supposed to make any sense of these selections. They are there because Jane

Austen was a woman, Ralph Ellison an African-American, and Victor Hugo a

chronicler of social injustice. For Greer and Kohl, female, African-American,

and poor children don't have imaginations, only wounds. Thus stories can

"heal," but whether or not they give pleasure is irrelevant.<p>

 

Some don't even aspire to healing. Instead they teach children how ruthless

life can be. Barry Lopez's pointless tale "Coyote and the Skunk Kill Game" has

a dishonest skunk who blinds, and a rapacious coyote who clubs to death, some

good-natured and very poignant prairie dogs and rabbits. The two murderers dig

a mass grave for their victims and cook them; the skunk then eats the corpses

after getting rid of the coyote on a ruse. Moral: "Calculated dishonesty can

also be a form of group or clique identity, making people fear to be left out."

If you're going to choose this as a bedtime story for your kids, you might as

well read them the Contract With America</A>. <p>



Or better yet, simply listen to Henry James. He's just right for liberals

(cosmopolitan, ambivalent), and perfect for conservatives, too (a classic, good

manners). "We work in the dark," James wrote. "We do what we can--we give what

we have." And after we have given our children all the love, protection, and

guidance we are able to, the best thing we can do for them is to leave them

alone in a lamplit room with Henry James--or Langston Hughes or Chaucer or

Plato or Denise Levertov or the Book of Exodus or Lewis Carroll--and close the

door gently behind us.

<font size=5>S</font>OMETIME IN 1912, before Robert Frost made his famous leap to "live under 

thatch" in England, where he would become known as a poet, he sent some of 

his poems to Ellery Sedgwick, the editor of <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>, 

and in due course received a personal reply that read, "We are sorry that 

we have no place in <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I> for your vigorous verse." 

Frost's submission included some of his finest early poems--"Reluctance," 

for example. <p>



     Sedgwick's ambiguous snub rankled in Frost's memory. During the 

two and a half years he lived in England his first two books of poetry, 

<I>A Boy's Will</I> (1913) and <I>North of Boston</I> (1914), were 

published there, though not yet in the United States. Thanks partly to 

Ezra Pound, Amy Lowell, and Harriet Monroe's <I>Poetry</I> magazine, 

Frost's poems were hailed in advance of U.S. publication as representing a 

new American voice. In February, 1915, <I>North of Boston</I> was 

published in New York, just as the Frost family set foot back in the 

United States.<p>



     Response to this new book of poems about New England was nearly 

immediate, and Frost was quickly in demand for public appearances. On May 

5, 1915, he came to Boston from his new home in Franconia, New Hampshire, 

to be heard at Tufts University, where he read three of his as yet 

unpublished poems: "Birches," "The Road Not Taken," and "The Sound of 

Trees." The day after his Tufts appearance, he called on Ellery Sedgwick 

at the <I>Atlantic</I> offices, which the magazine shared with Houghton 

Mifflin Company at 4 Park Street. Sedgwick had just received a letter from 

the noted English editor and critic Edward Garnett (also the discoverer of 

Joseph Conrad and D. H. Lawrence), in which Garnett wrote that "since 

Whitman's death, no American poet has appeared, of so <I>unique a 

quality</I>, as Mr. Frost." It's not surprising that Sedgwick received 

Frost with a warm welcome and began by asking if Frost had any new poems 

for <I>The Atlantic</I>.<p>



     Pretending to be taken aback, Frost asked Sedgwick if he were sure he 

wanted to publish Frost's poems. "Yes," said Sedgwick. "Sight unseen?" 

asked Frost. "Sight unseen," said Sedgwick. Pulling from his pocket the 

three poems he had read at Tufts only the night before, Frost waved them 

under Sedgwick's nose, while, according to Frost, Sedgwick made little 

grabs for them. "Are you <I>sure</I> that you want to buy these poems?" 

Frost inquired. Sedgwick said of course he was. "Then," Frost said, 

releasing the papers to Sedgwick, "They are yours."<p>



And so, in the August, 1915, issue of <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>, there 

appeared <A HREF="RFpoems.htm">"A Group of Poems by Robert Frost."</A> 

These three famous poems--"Birches," "The Road Not Taken," and 

"The Sound of Trees,"--were the first new poems by Frost to be published in 

the United States since the publication of <I>North of Boston</I>.  

They were accompanied by Edward Garnett's critical essay <A 

HREF="garnett.htm">"A New American Poet,"</A> in which he wrote, "it is 

precisely its quiet passion and spiritual tenderness that betray this to be 

poetry of a rare order, [quoting Goethe] 'the poetry of a true real natural 

vision of life.'" Here also is <A 

HREF="reluctan.htm">"Reluctance,"</A> the great poem Sedgwick declined.  <p>



A footnote: Frost went on, until his death in 1963, to publish 

twenty-eight more poems in <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>. But it is amusing 

to note that the flirtatious relationship between Frost and Sedgwick 

proved uneasy. Only two more Frost poems appeared while Sedgwick was 

editor; all the rest came at the behest and during the editorship of 

Edward Weeks.<P>

<B>A Note on the Recordings and the Text:</B><br> 



Peter Davison made these recordings at <I>The Atlantic 

Monthly</I>'s offices in Boston on February 29, 1996.  The text we are 

using here is that of the original versions of the poems as they appeared 

in the August, 1915, issue of <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>.  There are some 

differences between this text and the text of the poems as they appeared in 

later editions of Frost's poetry.  We have indicated significant differences in 

footnotes.  For the authoritative version of the text we are using <I>Robert 

Frost: Collected Poems, Prose, & Plays</I> (Library of America, 1995).  <p>







<B>A Note About the Audio:</B><br>

	<font size=5>A</font><font size=3>pproaching McKean, the

federal correctional institution in Bradford, Pennsylvania, one is

not likely to think of a prison. The buildings, low and modern, display a

pseudo-Navajo motif in soft gray and salmon colors. In the air-conditioned

entryway there are carpets over an immaculate tile floor, the glimmer of

polished glass, the green tint of tropical plants. Tasteful couches sit in the

corners. Well-dressed employees walk up and down the stairs, speaking in

hushed, respectful tones. Beyond, on the prison grounds, are a broad expanse of

well-tended lawn and distant athletic fields. Inmates walk alone or in pairs

along the concrete pathways, offering greetings as they pass. Across the

compound inmates sit quietly in classrooms, learning everything from basic

reading skills to masonry, carpentry, horticulture, barbering, cooking, and

catering. Next door is a multi-denominational chapel. The cellblocks are

cramped but clean and orderly, with a weekly inspection score posted on the

wall. "With visitors, it's like a joke, to see how long before they compare

this place to a college campus," one prison staff member says.<p>



<A HREF="./prisind.htm"><img src="../../../images/shorsera.gif" align=left vspace=10 hspace=10 border=0>

This prison and others like it are the targets of a fierce campaign that is

changing the shape of the U.S. criminal-justice system. For several years

journalists and politicians all over the country have spoken and written

angrily about such prisons as "resorts" or "country clubs." They have railed

against a philosophy of rehabilitation that "coddles" inmates with too many

amenities. Punishment is in vogue, along with hard labor and "no frills"

prisons, stripped of weight rooms, TVs, and computers. Republicans in Congress

have added a <A HREF="file://nofrills.htm">no-frills-prison section</A> to the Contract With America's "Take Back

Our Streets Act," and they have passed it as an amendment to the <A HREF="http://gopher.usdoj.gov/crime/crime.html">1994 crime

bill</A>. Massachusetts Governor William F. Weld has argued that prisons should be

"a tour through the circles of hell," where inmates should learn only "the joys

of busting rocks." Alabama has already reinstituted the chain gang, forcing

inmates to do hard labor in leg irons for up to ten hours a day. State

administrators and sheriffs, sniffing the political wind, have begun to crack

down, cutting educational and treatment programs, making prison life as harsh

as possible.<p>



Yet McKean, by several measures, may well be the most successful

medium-security prison in the country. Badly overcrowded, housing a growing

number of violent criminals, it costs taxpayers approximately $15,370 a year

for each inmate. That is below the average for prisons of its type, and far

below the overall federal average of $21,350. It is about two thirds of what

many state prisons cost. And the incident record since McKean opened, in 1989,

reads like a blank slate: No escapes. No homicides. No sexual assaults. No

suicides. In six years there have been three serious assaults on staff members

and six recorded assaults on inmates. State prisons of comparable size often

see that many assaults in a single week. The American Correctional Society has

given McKean one of its highest possible ratings. No recidivism studies have

been conducted on its former inmates, but senior staff members claim that

McKean parolees return to prison far less often than those from other

institutions, and a local parole officer agrees. According to the Princeton

University criminologist John DiIulio, "McKean is probably the best-managed

prison in the country. And that has everything to do with a warden named Dennis

Luther."<p>





	<img src="./prisons.gif" align=left width=200 height=133 hspace=10 vspace=10>



Dennis Luther is a slim man of fifty with thinning brown hair and wide, curious

eyes. He retired last July, after sixteen years as a warden. He dresses neatly

in a jacket, a tie, and tasseled loafers, more like an English professor than a

prison administrator. His movements are slow and deliberate, and his voice has

an uncanny steadiness to it. He is not a large man, but it is easy to imagine

him walking unarmed into the center of a prison riot and asking calmly to speak

to the leaders. As a young man, Luther considered going into the ministry. He

chose corrections instead, and soon came to believe that American prisons were

unnecessarily brutal places, more likely to teach hatred and violence than

remorse. But, he says, that insight did not lead him to a liberal philosophy of

inmate rehabilitation. Instead he read up on business management. He saw no

reason why ideas that had worked in the private sector could not be applied to

prisons, to make them more cost-effective and more humane. What he came up with

was a systematic approach to building something he calls "prison culture." All

prisons, according to Luther, have a culture of some sort, but it is generally

violent and abusive, based on gangs. Prison staffs are aware of this culture,

but they are helpless to change it.<p>



The root of Luther's approach is an unconditional respect for the inmates as

people. "If you want people to behave responsibly, and treat you with respect,

then you treat other people that way," Luther says. McKean is literally

decorated with this conviction. Plaques all over the prison remind staff

members and inmates alike of their responsibilities; one of these plaques is

titled "Beliefs About the Treatment of Inmates." There are twenty-eight

beliefs, the product of Luther's many years as a warden, and they begin like

this:<br><p>



1.	Inmates are sent to prison <i>as</i> punishment and not <i>for

</i>punishment.<p>



2.	Correctional workers have a <i>responsibility </i>to ensure that inmates are

returned to the community no more angry or hostile than when they were

committed. <p>



3.	Inmates are <i>entitled </i>to a safe and humane environment while in

prison.<p>



4.	You must believe in man's <i>capacity </i>to change his behavior.<p>



5.	Normalize the environment to the extent possible by providing programs,

amenities, and services. The denial of such must be related to maintaining

order and security rather than punishment.<p>



6.	Most inmates will respond favorably to a clean and aesthetically pleasing

physical environment and will not vandalize or destroy it.<p>

To a visitor, McKean's "clean and aesthetically pleasing" environment is its

most striking feature. Impressions gleaned from <i>Midnight Express, Judge

Dredd</i>, or an ordinary state prison are out of place here. Luther insists

that these physical details help to maintain order, just as the programs do.

During my visit, as he led me past the special housing unit that is known in

most prisons as "the hole" to the recreation area, a group of inmates appeared

in the distance, jogging on a circular track around an athletic field. "Some of

the staff think there's too much recreation here," he told me. "Most think it's

important. On a summer evening you've got three to five hundred men in this rec

yard, with three staff. If you had less recreation, you'd need more staff.

There's a clear economic advantage. You'd <i>definitely </i>have more fights.

We do surveys every year, and they show that as inmates get more involved in

the rec program, they get in less trouble. Also, they tend to have less health

trouble, and that saves money."<p>



Even without recreation programs most of the inmates at McKean would keep busy,

with work assignments or training programs. Forty-seven percent are enrolled in

classes, which is one of the highest rates in the federal system. Many inmates

earn licenses that help them to get jobs when they are released. They also have

opportunities to teach one another--a mentors' group, for instance, and the "I

Care" group, which holds discussions about issues of prison life. Many inmates

teach Adult Continuing Education as well. These programs are not mere frills,

Luther claims, because they help to keep the prison running smoothly. "The

older guys see some young guy who's got forty years to do," one staff member

told me. "They think, He's angry, and he's scared of me, and I've got to do

time with this guy. So they see it as a challenge to get some of the younger

guys involved in the ed program; they see that as the only hope. They do it a

lot of different ways--mentoring, whether formally or informally--to somehow

expand the resources of this younger population coming in. Wherever the staff

leave that challenge, the older inmates pick it up." <p>



Education may be the most effective way to lower prison costs. DiIulio, who is

well known in Washington for his pessimism about rehabilitation, claims, "In

some prison systems cost-effective management is possible only because programs

keep prisoners busy, with less supervision than you'd need otherwise.

Especially with respect to certain types of prison educational programs, you

save money by hiring fewer officers in the short run <i>and </i>reducing

recidivism in the long run." The Corrections Corporation of America, a publicly

traded company that was founded on the principle of cost-effective management,

takes the same line on the value of educational programs.<p>



In some respects McKean is stricter than other prisons, because inmates are

held to higher standards. Three years ago, after a few minor incidents, Luther

imposed a condition known as "closed" movement, restricting inmates' activity

during evening hours. The condition was meant to be permanent. A group of

inmates asked him if he would restore "open" movement if the prison was

incident-free for a period of ninety days. He agreed, and the prison has run on

open movement ever since. Many McKean inmates will also say that they do not

carry "shanks"--homemade knives or blades--because they don't need them. The

McKean staff takes weapons very seriously, and inmates found with them will be

prosecuted and put in isolation.<p>



Luther successfully transformed every aspect of prison life into a management

tool. Each cellblock has a weekly inspection, and the inmates of those that

score high enough are allowed to use the TV and phone rooms at night. They can

also earn their way to the "honor unit," which almost always passes inspection

and is especially quiet. Inmates who show consistently good behavior are

allowed to attend supervised picnics on Family Day, so that they can start

adjusting to life on the outside. Even the staff is involved in McKean's system

of incentives. Any suggestion from a staff member will receive a response

within twenty-four hours, and if it is adopted, the staff member earns a star

next to his or her office plaque, redeemable for $25.00. This system may sound

patronizing, but it enhances morale. "It's all in the culture the warden has

established here," one staff member says. "It's a culture of responsiveness."<p>





<font size=4>N</font><font size=3>onetheless, Dennis Luther achieved his successes against the will of <A HREF="http://gopher.usdoj.gov/bop/bop.html">Bureau of

Prisons</A> senior management. The bureau declined to comment, but Luther claims

that officials there saw him as "a maverick, as someone who violates bureau

policy flagrantly." Some of the more successful programs at McKean --the Inmate

Benefit Fund, for instance (which raised $50,000 a year, much of it for local

charities)--have been cut by the bureau, whose director serves at the

discretion of the Attorney General. Inmates' access to computers and other

amenities has been reduced in the past year, and now, with Luther retired, the

trend may continue. Education also suffered at McKean--and at all other

prisons--when the 1994 crime bill denied prisoners the right to apply for <A HREF="http://www.ed.gov/prog_info/SFA/StudentGuide/fpg.html">Pell

grants</A>. Grants to prisoners, according to congressional logic, were unfair to

those hardworking citizens who cannot afford to pay for a college education. In

fact, no eligible applicant for a Pell grant ever lost out to an inmate,

because the grants are awarded on a merit basis, with any  costs above the

yearly appropriation coming out of the next year's budget. Less than one

percent of all Pell-grant funds went to prisoners during the 1993- 1994 award

year. With the loss of the grants, prison college programs are virtually

extinct.<p>

But the Pell-grant controversy is only a small part of a huge and largely

undocumented trend. The increase in prison violence over the past few years has

coincided with big cuts in educational and vocational programming at all

levels. College-aid programs like one administered by New York State's Tuition

Assistance Program have died, and allocations for basic literacy and GED

programs have been scaled back drastically. At least twenty-five states have

made cuts in vocational and technical training, the areas most likely to

provide inmates with an alternative career when they leave prison. Most states

now have long waiting lists for classes of any kind. Even in states where

programs have not been cut, prison overcrowding has often rendered them almost

useless. Class sizes have increased so rapidly that the standard approach for

elementary-level courses, according to one prison teacher, is "throw them the

GED handbook and say `Let me know when you're finished.' You can't learn that

way." In New Jersey the ratio of inmates to prison programs rose from 32 to 1

in 1984 to 83 to 1 at the beginning of last year. <p>



Numerous studies have shown a correspondence between educational programs and

reduced recidivism rates. There is no question that college-level programs at

Roosevelt University, in Chicago; Boston University; and Ball State, in

Indiana, have had remarkable success with inmates, many of whom have gone on to

work in social services and treatment programs themselves. And federal surveys

have found a significant difference between those prisoners who participated in

classes and those who did not. The trouble with all these studies is that they

do not distinguish between inmates for whom education made a real difference

and those who were already unlikely to be sent back to prison. The best way to

eliminate this problem of self-selection would be to offer education to

prisoners at random, retain an identical control group that did not receive it,

and then monitor the progress of the two groups after parole. <p>



Whatever its effect on recidivism rates, education clearly makes prisons easier

and less expensive to run. Prison costs are rapidly spinning out of control. In

the past decade state and federal prison expenses have risen from approximately

$12 billion to $24.6 billion. That estimate is low, because some costs are

invariably left out in the process of reporting and because prisons put fiscal

pressure on other government agencies as well. For instance, the costs of

lawsuits that are brought by federal prisoners are borne by the Attorney

General's Office, not the Bureau of Prisons. And state attorneys general bear

the costs of constitutional challenges to their prison systems. Prison costs

are continuing to rise with the implementation of the 1994 crime bill, which

puts financial pressure on states to adopt harsher sentencing guidelines, and

which includes a "three strikes" mandatory life-sentence provision for

three-time violent offenders. These measures will swell the ranks of prisons

that are already bursting with nonviolent offenders. By the turn of the century

corrections are likely to be the largest item in many state budgets. Already

California is spending more on its prisons than on its universities, and the

state correctional officers' union has lobbied hard for tougher sentencing

laws. <p>



Within a decade a baby boomlet will  add another million boys in the fourteen-to-seventeen-year-old range to our population. According to James Q. Wilson, of

the University of California at Los Angeles, at least six percent of those will

commit violent crimes. That means 30,000 more young killers, rapists, and

thieves. Some of them will be what DiIulio calls "super-predators"--a new

variety of young criminal who has no adults in his life and no apparent

capacity for remorse. With today's long sentences and high rates of

incarceration, many of these younger criminals will be spending their lives in

prison, at taxpayer expense. "There's a tornado coming," DiIulio claims. "We

can't stop it; we have to prepare for it."<p>

Intelligent prison policy is necessary now more than ever before. Yet

politicians have been unwilling to forsake the popular fixation with "getting

tough on crime" by getting tough on prisoners. The 1994 crime bill authorized

$7.9 billion for prison construction, and House Republicans have added another

$2.3 billion to that. Some of the new prisons are necessary, but they will be

counterproductive if they are run on the no-frills principle, with no

vocational programs, no drug treatment, no education. "It's easy for

politicians to advertise building more prisons, because up-front costs are

negligible," according to Norman Carlson, who directed the Federal Bureau of

Prisons from 1970 to 1987. "Construction costs are just the tip of the

iceberg." Some politicians appear to recognize the gravity of the problem. New

Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman now pays lip service to the idea that

more prison educational programs could reduce recidivism. But she will not fund

them. As one teacher at East Jersey State Prison put it, "If this place blows

up, they'll blame the lack of education. But they're cutting back."

Dennis Luther is still convinced that his methods would work in any prison,

even those most plagued with violence, overcrowding, and gangs. He had inmates

in transfer who were violent in other prisons, he says, and when they reached

McKean, they tended to calm down. But he has no illusions about the future of

crime policy. "If the trend continues, prisons are going to become very

different places to work in," he told me. "It's hard enough now to recruit a

qualified staff for a prison. And I don't think we've seen anything yet."

McKean staff members who worked under Luther feel the same way. Many have

worked in other prisons, both state and federal, and they consider McKean a

shining example of the difference good management can make. They don't expect

it to last. Nor do the inmates, one of whom has written an M.A. thesis arguing

that prisoners should have the opportunity to earn back the cost of their

incarceration and <i>then </i>get an education. This is similar to arguments

from inmates throughout the country: providing a long-term goal helps them to

stay sane and makes them less prone to violence. It also makes the entire

prison easier and less expensive to manage. But prisoners know very well that

the current political trend is in the opposite direction. And none of them have

any doubt about what the result will be. As one inmate serving a life term at

East Jersey State Prison puts it, "You create Spartan conditions, you're gonna

get gladiators."

<font size=5><img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="T"></font>HE United States is on the verge of another great debate over immigration.
Thus far the focus of this still-inchoate debate has been on illegal
immigration or welfare benefits to legal immigrants, not on the larger issue of
the character and consequences of the current high levels of legal immigration.
Economic factors by themselves should not and will not decide the outcome of
this debate. But they will play an important role. Economics helps us to frame
answerable questions about immigration: Who gains by it? Who loses? And in
light of the answers to these questions, what should U.S. immigration policy 
be?<p>

There have been two major shifts in immigration policy in this century. In the
twenties the United States began to limit the number of immigrants admitted and
established the national-origins quota system, an allocation scheme that
awarded entry visas mainly on the basis of national origin and that favored
Germany and the United Kingdom. This system was repealed in 1965, and family
reunification became the central goal of immigration policy, with entry visas
being awarded mainly to applicants who had relatives already residing in the
United States.<p>

The social, demographic, and economic changes initiated by the <a 
href="http://www.fairus.org/history/03101603.htm">1965 legislation</a>
have been truly historic. The number of immigrants began to rise rapidly. As
recently as the 1950s only about 250,000 immigrants entered the country
annually; by the 1990s the United States was admitting more than 800,000 legal
immigrants a year, and some 300,000 aliens entered and stayed in the country
illegally. The 1965 legislation also led to a momentous shift in the ethnic
composition of the population. Although people of European origin dominated the
immigrant flow from the country's founding until the 1950s, only about 10
percent of those admitted in the 1980s were of European origin. It is now
estimated that non-Hispanic whites may form a minority of the population soon
after 2050. More troubling is that immigration has been linked to the increase
in income inequality observed since the 1980s, and to an increase in the costs
of maintaining the programs that make up the welfare state.<p>

These economic and demographic changes have fueled the incipient debate over
immigration policy. For the most part, the weapons of choice in this debate are
statistics produced by economic research, with all sides marshaling facts and
evidence that support particular policy goals. In this essay I ask a simple
question: What does economic research imply about the kind of immigration
policy that the United States should pursue?<p><br>


<h3>
<center><a name="RTFToC1">A
Formula for Admission
</a></center>
</h3>
<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/E-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="E"></font>VERY immigration policy must resolve two distinct issues: how many immigrants
the country should admit, and what kinds of people they should be.<p>

It is useful to view immigration policy as a formula that gives points to visa
applicants on the basis of various characteristics and then sets a passing
grade. The variables in the formula determine what kinds of people will be let
into the country, and the passing grade determines how many will be let into
the country. Current policy uses a formula that has one overriding variable:
whether the visa applicant has a family member already residing in the United
States. An applicant who has a relative in the country gets 100 points, passes
the test, and is admitted. An applicant who does not gets 0 points, fails the
test, and cannot immigrate legally.<p>

Of course, this is a simplistic summary of current policy. There are a lot of
bells and whistles in the immigration statutes (which are said to be only
slightly less complex than the tax code). In fact the number of points a person
gets may depend on whether the sponsor is a U.S. citizen or a permanent
resident, and whether the family connection is a close one (such as a parent, a
spouse, or a child) or a more distant one (a sibling). Such nuances help to
determine the speed with which the visa is granted. A limited number of visas
are given to refugees. Some are also distributed on the basis of skill
characteristics, but these go to only seven percent of immigrants. <p>

Although the United States does not officially admit to using a point system in
awarding entry visas, other countries proudly display their formulas on the
Internet. A comparison of these point systems reveals that the United States is
exceptional in using essentially one variable. Canada, Australia, and New
Zealand have more-complex formulas that include an applicant's educational
background, occupation, English-language proficiency, and age along with family
connections.<p>

Sometimes a host country awards points to people who are willing to pay the
visa's stated price. Canada, for example, has granted entry to virtually anyone
who would invest at least $250,000 in a Canadian business. Although this
"visas-for-sale" policy is a favorite proposal of economists (if we have a
market for butter, why not also a market for visas?), it is not taken very
seriously in the political debate, perhaps because policymakers feel a
repugnance against what may be perceived as a market for human beings. I will
therefore discuss the implications of economic research only for policies in
which points are awarded on the basis of socioeconomic characteristics, not
exchanged for dollars.<p><br>

<h3>
<center>
<a name="RTFToC2">What Have We Learned?
</a></center>
</h3>
<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="T"></font>HE academic literature investigating the economic impact of immigration on the
United States has grown rapidly in the past decade. The assumptions that long
dominated discussion of the costs and benefits of immigration were replaced
during the 1980s by a number of new questions, issues, and perceptions.<p>

Consider the received wisdom of the early 1980s. The studies available
suggested that even though immigrants arrived at an economic disadvantage,
their opportunities improved rapidly over time. Within a decade or two of
immigrants' arrival their earnings would overtake the earnings of natives of
comparable socioeconomic background. The evidence also suggested that
immigrants did no harm to native employment opportunities, and were less likely
to receive welfare assistance than natives. Finally, the children of immigrants
were even more successful than their parents. The empirical evidence,
therefore, painted a very optimistic picture of the contribution that
immigrants made to the American economy.<p>

In the past ten years this picture has altered radically. New research has
established a number of points.<p>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<li> The relative skills of successive immigrant waves have declined over much of
the postwar period. In 1970, for example, the latest immigrant arrivals on
average had 0.4 fewer years of schooling and earned 17 percent less than
natives. By 1990 the most recently arrived immigrants had 1.3 fewer years of
schooling and earned 32 percent less than natives.<p>

<li> Because the newest immigrant waves start out at such an economic
disadvantage, and because the rate of economic assimilation is not very rapid,
the earnings of the newest arrivals may never reach parity with the earnings of
natives. Recent arrivals will probably earn 20 percent less than natives
throughout much of their working lives.<p>

<li> The large-scale migration of less-skilled workers has done harm to the
economic opportunities of less-skilled natives. Immigration may account for
perhaps a third of the recent decline in the relative wages of less-educated
native workers.<p>

<li> The new immigrants are more likely to receive welfare assistance than earlier
immigrants, and also more likely to do so than natives: 21 percent of immigrant
households participate in some means-tested social-assistance program (such as
cash benefits, <a 
href="http://www.blueworld.com/milliman/publications/reports/understanding_medicaid/introduction.html">
Medicaid</a>, or food stamps), as compared with 14 percent of native
households.<p>

<li> The increasing welfare dependency in the immigrant population suggests that
immigration may create a substantial fiscal burden on the most-affected
localities and states.<p>

<li> There are economic benefits to be gained from immigration. These arise
because certain skills that immigrants bring into the country complement those
of the native population. However, these economic benefits are small -- perhaps
on the order of $7 billion annually.<p>

<li> There exists a strong correlation between the skills of immigrants and the
skills of their American-born children, so that the huge skill differentials
observed among today's foreign-born groups will almost certainly become
tomorrow's differences among American-born ethnic groups. In effect,
immigration has set the stage for sizable ethnic differences in skills and
socioeconomic outcomes, which are sure to be the focus of intense attention in
the next century.<p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


The United States is only beginning to observe the economic consequences of the
historic changes in the numbers, national origins, and skills of immigrants
admitted over the past three decades. Regardless of how immigration policy
changes in the near future, we have already set in motion circumstances that
will surely alter the economic prospects of native workers and the costs of
social-insurance programs not only in our generation but for our children and
grandchildren as well.<p><br>

<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/I-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="I"></font>F economic research is to play a productive role in the immigration debate,
research findings should help us to devise the formula that determines
admission into the United States. We need to decide what variables are to be
used to award points to applicants, and what is to be the passing grade. Before
we can resolve these issues, however, we have to address a difficult
philosophical question: What should the United States try to accomplish with
its immigration policy?<p>

The answer to this question is far from obvious, even when the question is
posed in purely economic terms. We can think of the world as composed of three
distinct groups: people born in the United States (natives), immigrants, and
people who remain in other countries. Whose economic welfare should the United
States try to improve when setting policy -- that of natives, of immigrants, of
the rest of the world, or of some combination of the three? The formula implied
by economic research depends on whose interests the United States cares most
about.<p>

Different political, economic, and moral arguments can be made in favor of each
of the three groups. I think that most participants in the U.S. policy debate
attach the greatest (and perhaps the only) weight to the well-being of natives.
This is not surprising. Natives dominate the market for political ideas in the
United States, and most proposals for immigration reform will unavoidably
reflect the self-interest and concerns of native voters.<p>

Immigration almost always improves the well-being of the immigrants. If they
don't find themselves better off after they enter the United States, they are
free to go back or to try their luck elsewhere -- and, indeed, some do. A few
observers attach great weight to the fact that many of the "huddled masses" now
live in relative comfort.<p>

As for the vast populations that remain in the source countries, they are
affected by U.S. immigration policy in a number of ways. Most directly, the
policy choices made by the United States may drain particular skills and
abilities from the labor markets of source countries. A brain drain slows
economic growth in the source countries, as the entrepreneurs and skilled
workers who are most likely to spur growth move to greener pastures. Similarly,
the principles of free trade suggest that world output would be largest if
there were no national borders to interfere with the free movement of people. A
policy that restricts workers from moving across borders unavoidably leads to a
smaller world economy, to the detriment of many source countries.<p>

The three groups may therefore have conflicting interests, and economics cannot
tell us whose interests matter most. The weight that we attach to each of the
three groups depends on our values and ideology. For the sake of argument I
will assume a political consensus that the objective of immigration policy is
to improve the economic well-being of the native population.<p>

Beyond that, we have to specify which dimension of native economic well-being
we care most about: per capita income or distribution of income. As we shall
see, immigration raises per capita income in the native population, but this
does not mean that all natives gain equally. In fact some natives are likely to
see their incomes greatly reduced. We must therefore be able to judge an
immigration policy in terms of its impact on two different economic dimensions:
the size of the economic pie (which economists call "efficiency") and how the
pie is sliced ("distribution"). The relative weights that we attach to
efficiency and distribution again depend on our values and ideology, and
economics provides no guidance on how to rank the two.<p>

For the most part, economists take a very narrow approach: policies that
increase the size of the pie are typically considered to be better policies,
regardless of their impact on the distribution of wealth in society. We shall
begin our construction of an immigration policy by taking this narrow approach.
In other words, let's assume that immigration policy has a single and
well-defined purpose: to maximize the size of the economic pie available to the
native population of the United States. We shall return to the distributional
issues raised by immigration policy later on.<p><br>

<a name="RTFToC1">The
Economic Case </a><a name="RTFToC2">for
Immigration
</a></center>
</h3>
<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="T"></font>O see how natives gain from immigration, let's first think about how the
United States gains from foreign trade. When we import toys made by cheap
Chinese labor, workers in the American toy industry undoubtedly suffer wage
cuts and perhaps even lose their jobs. These losses, however, are more than
offset by the benefits accruing to consumers, who enjoy the lower prices
induced by additional competition. An important lesson from this exercise,
worth remembering when we look at the gains from immigration, is that for there
to be gains from foreign trade for the economy as a whole, some sectors of the
economy must lose.<p>

Consider the analogous argument for immigration. Immigrants increase the number
of workers in the economy. Because they create additional competition in the
labor market, the wages of native workers fall. At the same time, however,
native-owned firms gain, because they can hire workers at lower wages; and many
native consumers gain because lower labor costs lead to cheaper goods and
services. The gains accruing to those who consume immigrants' services exceed
the losses suffered by native workers, and hence society as a whole is better
off. <p>

Immigration therefore has two distinct consequences. The size of the economic
pie increases. And a redistribution of income is induced, from native workers
who compete with immigrant labor to those who use immigrants' services.<p>

The standard economic model of the labor market suggests that the net gain from
immigration is small. The United States now has more than 20 million
foreign-born residents, making up slightly less than 10 percent of the
population. I have estimated that native workers lose about $133 billion a year
as a result of this immigration (or 1.9 percent of the gross domestic product
in a $7 trillion economy), mainly because immigrants drive down wages. However,
employers -- from the owners of large agricultural enterprises to people who hire
household help -- gain on the order of $140 billion (or 2.0 percent of GDP). The
net gain, which I call the immigration surplus, is only about $7 billion. Thus
the increase in the per capita income of natives is small -- less than $30 a
year. But the small size of this increase masks a substantial redistribution of
wealth.<p>

My calculation used the textbook model of a competitive labor market: wages and
employment are determined in a free market that balances the desires of people
looking for work with the needs of firms looking for workers. In this framework
an increase in the number of workers reduces wages in the economy -- immigrants
join natives in the competition for jobs and bid down wages in the process.
There is a lot of disagreement over how much native wages fall when immigrants
enter the labor market. Nevertheless, a great deal of empirical research in
economics, often unrelated to the question of immigration, concludes that a 10
percent increase in the number of workers lowers wages by about three
percent.<p>

If we accept this finding, we can argue as follows: We know that about 70
percent of GDP accrues to workers (with the rest going to the owners of
companies), and that natives make up slightly more than 90 percent of the
population. Therefore, native workers take home about 63 percent of GDP in the
form of wages and salaries. If the 10 percent increase in the number of workers
due to immigration has lowered wages by three percent, the share of GDP
accruing to native workers has fallen by 1.9 percentage points (or 0.63 x
0.03). Thus my conclusion that in a $7 trillion economy native earnings drop by
$133 billion.<p>

Those lost earnings do not vanish into thin air. They represent an income
transfer from workers to users of immigrants' services -- the employers of
immigrants and the consumers who buy the goods and services produced by
immigrants. These winners get to pocket the $133 billion -- and then some,
because the goods produced by immigrant workers generate additional profits for
employers. Under the assumption that a 10 percent increase in the number of
workers reduces wages by three percent, it turns out that the winners get a
windfall totaling $140 billion. Hence the $7 billion immigration surplus.<p>

We can quibble about assumptions, but the rigor of economic theory suggests
that this nitpicking may not alter our conclusions much. For example, one could
argue -- and many do -- that immigrants do not reduce the earnings of native
workers. If we wished to believe this, however, we would also be forced to
conclude that natives do not benefit from immigration at all. If wages do not
fall, there are no savings in employers' payrolls and no cost savings to be
passed on to native consumers. Remember the lesson from the foreign-trade
example: no pain, no gain.<p>

One could also argue that immigration has reduced the earnings of natives
very substantially -- by, say, 10 percent. The immigration surplus would then be
about $25 billion annually. The net gain from immigration, therefore, remains
small even with an unrealistically high estimate of the impact of immigration
on native earnings. Imagine what U.S. policy would look like today if our
earnings had fallen by 10 percent as a result of past immigration.<p>

The immigration surplus has to be balanced against the cost of providing
services to the immigrant population. Immigrants have high rates of welfare
recipiency. Estimates of the fiscal impact of immigration (that is, of the
difference between the taxes paid by immigrants and the cost of services
provided to them) vary widely. Some studies claim that immigrants pay $25-$30
billion more in taxes than they take out of the system, while other studies
blame them for a fiscal burden of more than $40 billion on natives.<p>

It is doubtful that either of these statistics accurately reflects the gap
between taxes paid and the cost of services provided. Studies that claim a
beneficial fiscal impact tend to assume that immigrants do not increase the
cost of most government programs other than education and welfare. Even though
we do not know by how much immigrants increase the cost of police protection,
maintaining roads and national parks, and so forth, we do know that it costs
more to provide these services to an ever larger population. However, studies
that claim a large fiscal burden often overstate the costs of immigration and
understate the taxes paid. As a result, estimates of the fiscal impact of
immigration should be viewed with suspicion. Nevertheless, because the
immigration surplus is around $7 billion, the net benefit from immigration
after accounting for the fiscal impact is very small, and could conceivably be
a net loss.<p><br>

</h3>
<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/I-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="I"></font>N principle, we should admit immigrants whenever their economic contribution
(to native well-being) will exceed the costs of providing social services to
them. We are not, though, in a position to make this calculation with any
reasonable degree of confidence. In fact, no mainstream study has ever
attempted to suggest, purely on the basis of the empirical evidence, how many
immigrants should be admitted.<p>

This unfortunate lack of guidance from economic research has, I believe, led to
sudden and remarkable swings in policy proposals. As recently as 1990 Congress
legislated an increase in the number of legal immigrants of about 175,000
people annually. Last year the <a 
href="http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/uscir/">Commission on Immigration 
Reform</a>, headed by Barbara Jordan, recommended that legal immigration be 
cut by about 240,000
people a year -- a proposal that was immediately supported by President Clinton.
(The Clinton Administration, however, successfully resisted congressional
efforts to follow up on the commission's recommendations.)<p>

Although we do not know how many immigrants to admit, simple economics and
common sense suggest that the magic number should not be an immutable constant
regardless of economic conditions in the United States. A good case can be made
for linking immigration to the business cycle: admit more immigrants when the
economy is strong and the unemployment rate is low, and cut back on immigration
when the economy is weak and the unemployment rate is high.<p>

Economic research also suggests that the United States may be better off if its
policy of awarding entry visas favors skilled workers. Skilled immigrants earn
more than less-skilled immigrants, and hence pay more in taxes, and they are
less likely to use welfare and other social services.<p>

Depending on how the skills of immigrants compare with the skills of natives,
immigrants also affect the productivity of the native work force and of
native-owned companies. Skilled native workers, for example, have much to gain
when less-skilled workers enter the United States: they can devote all their
efforts to jobs that use their skills effectively while immigrants provide
cheap labor for service jobs. These gains, however, come at a cost. The jobs of
less-skilled natives are now at risk, and these natives will suffer a reduction
in their earnings. Nonetheless, it does not seem far-fetched to assume that the
American work force, particularly in comparison with the work forces of many
source countries, is composed primarily of skilled workers. Thus the typical
American worker would seem to gain from unskilled immigration.<p>

How does immigration affect companies' profits? Companies that use less-skilled
workers on the production line gain from the immigration of the less-skilled,
who reduce the earnings of less-skilled workers in favor of increasing profits.
However, other companies -- perhaps even most -- might be better off with skilled
immigrants. Many studies in economics suggest that skilled labor is better
suited to the machines that are now used widely in the production process. Most
companies would therefore gain more if the immigrant flow were composed of
skilled workers.<p>

Most workers prefer unskilled immigrants, whereas most companies prefer skilled
immigrants. This conflict can be resolved only by measuring how much native
workers gain from unskilled immigration and how much companies gain from
skilled immigration, and comparing the two. Although there is a lot of
uncertainty in the academic literature, we do know that the productivity of
capital is very responsive to an influx of skilled workers. The large increase
in the profits of the typical company, and the corresponding reduction in the
cost of goods produced by skilled workers, suggest that the United States might
be better off with a policy favoring skilled immigrants.<p>

The gains from skilled immigration will be even larger if immigrants have
"external effects" on the productivity of natives. One could argue, for
example, that immigrants may bring knowledge, skills, and abilities that
natives lack, and that natives might somehow pick up this know-how by
interacting with immigrants. It seems reasonable to suspect that the value of
these external effects would be greater if natives interact with highly skilled
immigrants. This increase in the human capital of natives might offset -- and
perhaps even reverse -- the harm that immigration does to the wages of competing
workers.<p>

Although such effects now play a popular role in economic theory, there is
little empirical evidence supporting their existence, let alone measuring their
magnitude. I find it difficult to imagine that interaction with immigrants
entering an economy as large as that of the United States could have a
measurable effect. Nevertheless, if external effects exist, they reinforce the
argument that the United States would gain most from skilled 
immigrants.<p><br>

most important contributions of this research are the insights that immigration
entails both gains and losses for the native population, that the winners and
the losers are typically different groups, and that policy parameters can be
set in ways that attempt to maximize gains and minimize losses. If the
objective of immigration policy is to increase the per capita income of the
native population, the evidence suggests that immigration policy should
encourage the entry of skilled workers. It is important to remember, however,
that even though the immigration of skilled workers would be beneficial for the
United States as a whole, the gains and losses would be concentrated in
particular subgroups of the population.<p>
 
As we have seen, the net gains from current immigration are small, so it is
unlikely that these gains can play a crucial role in the policy debate.
Economic research teaches a very valuable lesson: the economic impact of
immigration is essentially distributional. Current immigration redistributes
wealth from unskilled workers, whose wages are lowered by immigrants, to
skilled workers and owners of companies that buy immigrants' services, and from
taxpayers who bear the burden of paying for the social services used by
immigrants to consumers who use the goods and services produced by immigrants.
<p>

Distributional issues drive the political debate over many social policies, and
immigration policy is no exception. The debate over immigration policy is not a
debate over whether the entire country is made better off by immigration -- the
gains from immigration seem much too small, and could even be outweighed by the
costs of providing increased social services. Immigration changes how the
economic pie is sliced up -- and this fact goes a long way toward explaining why
the debate over how many and what kinds of immigrants to admit is best viewed
as a tug-of-war between those who gain from immigration and those who lose from
it.<p>

History has taught us that immigration policy changes rarely, but when it does,
it changes drastically. Can economic research play a role in finding a better
policy? I believe it can, but there are dangers ahead. Although the pendulum
seems to be swinging to the restrictionist side (with ever louder calls for a
complete closing of our borders), a greater danger to the national interest may
be the few economic groups that gain much from immigration. They seem
indifferent to the costs that immigration imposes on other segments of society,
and they have considerable financial incentives to keep the current policy in
place. The harmful effects of immigration will not go away simply because some
people do not wish to see them. In the short run these groups may simply delay
the day of reckoning. Their potential long-run impact, however, is much more
perilous: the longer the delay, the greater the chances that when immigration
policy finally changes, it will undergo a seismic shift -- one that, as in the
twenties, may come close to shutting down the border and preventing Americans
from enjoying the benefits that a well-designed immigration policy can bestow
on the United States.

	<font size=5>T</font>HE foothills of southeastern Vermont were once dairy country, although by the
time I arrived, twenty years ago, dairying was mostly finished. One farm in the
neighborhood still kept a few milkers, though, and it was there that I became
acquainted with a particular local custom that is, I find, rarely celebrated in
articles on endearing rural ways through the seasons. Their authors will tell
you how to tap a maple in March, mow hay in June, and make cider in October,
but by failing to touch on the subject I refer to, they neglect a passage in the
turning year that is as venerable as these but darker and more pointed.
One morning in November, looking into my neighbor's pasture, I observed an
uncanny thing: on the nearest of his animals the word COW had been painted with
whitewash in letters two feet high. A further look revealed that the entire
herd had been painted the same way. What was this? Was the herd's owner perhaps
expecting a visit from city people in need of rural education? Was his tractor
painted TRACTOR, his barn BARN? I asked him.<p>

"Well, you know what tomorrow is," my neighbor said.<p>

"Saturday?" I said.<p>

"You're new around here," he said. "You'll see."<p>

I saw, all right. More precisely, I heard. The next morning Vermont's two-week
<a href="http://www.tiac.net/users/dstein/nw376.html>deer-hunting </a> season began. 
Just before dawn the slumbering woods erupted with
the fell echo of small arms. Single gunshots, doubles, volleys of three or
four, came from all points of the compass, some far off, others seemingly in
the living room. By eleven the fire had mounted to a fusillade worthy of
Antietam. Across the road, however, my neighbor's cows survived. They hugged
the earth fearfully, like Tommies at the Somme, but they were alive. After all,
no deer hunter who could read would shoot a COW.<p>

<center>
*  *  *
</center><p>


Since then I have become a close student of the lengths to which people go each
year on the eve of deer season to provide a margin of safety for themselves,
their loved ones, their livestock, their pets. This is the season when dogs
wear brightly colored bandannas around their necks, like John Wayne and
Montgomery Clift in <i>Red River</i>. Cats and smaller dogs, as far as I can
tell, have to take their chances along with the deer, although I don't know why
the kind of elegant dog vest to be seen on the Pekingeses of Park Avenue
shouldn't be produced in hunter orange for the greater safety of their country
cousins.<p>

That same hunter orange, a hideous toxic color, suddenly appears everywhere in
mid-November, like the untimely bloom of an evil flower. <a href="http://dialin.ind.net/~dburton/hunting.html">
Hunters</a> themselves, of course, wear hunter orange to make it less likely that 
they'll be shot by their peers. But civilians, too, turn up in hunter-orange caps, 
vests, sweaters, and jackets, as they go about their business outdoors during 
this uneasy fortnight in the year.<p>

Uneasy indeed. Are you a hiker, a birder, an idle tramper through the woods? In
deer season you think twice before setting out--think twice and then stay home.
If you're a nonhunter, it's painful to avoid the woods and fields as though
they were a deserted street in the South Bronx. There is also the trouble of
preparing for deer season. It's not as though you don't have enough to do to
get the place ready for winter without having to find time to paint the cow,
flag the dog, pray for the cat, and plan two weeks' worth of useful projects to
do in the cellar.<p>

The heaviest demands that deer season makes on the nonhunter, however, it makes
not on his time but on his mind. You have to reflect. You have to collect your
thoughts. You don't want to move into deer season without having examined your
responses, your beliefs.<p>

I don't object to deer hunting: let everyone have his sport, I say. I don't for
a moment doubt the value, importance, and dignity of hunting for those who do
it. Deer hunting teaches skill, discipline, and patience. More than that, it
teaches the moral lesson of seriousness--that certain things must be entered
into advisedly, done with care, and done right. That hunting provides an
education I am very willing to believe. And yet deer season is for me a sad
couple of weeks. Because with all its profound advantages for the hunter, the
fact remains that deer season is a little tough on the deer.<p>

Suddenly deer turn up in strange places: thrown down in the backs of pickup
trucks; roped on top of cars; hanging in front of barns; flopped in blood
across platform scales in front of country stores and gas stations. It's hard
to recognize in those abject, inert cadavers the agile creatures you surprise
along the roads at night or see sometimes in the woods picking their way on
slender legs and then bounding off, the most graceful animals in North America.
It's hard to see them so defeated, so dead.<p>

It's particularly hard for children, those instinctive animal lovers, to see
deer season's bloody harvest hauled out of the woods. It's especially hard to
explain to them why it isn't wrong to kill deer--or, if it is wrong, why nobody
can stop it, and how it is that the hunters themselves, who are also your
friends and neighbors, are otherwise such familiar, decent, innocent people.
It's a lesson in ambiguity, I guess--a lesson in tolerance.<p>

I had a number of conversations along these lines with my children when they
were young, inconclusive conversations with on their side conviction and
passion, and on my own . . . nothing satisfactory. What do you tolerate, why,
and how? How do you separate the act from the friend, and condemn the one but
not the other? Not an easy matter at any age, in any season.<p>

We don't have those talks anymore. The children are older now. They know that
with some things all you can do is figure out how you will conduct your own
life and let others do the same. Perhaps they have learned this in part from
deer season. If so, I'm content. Let the gunners fire at will--and as for the
nonhunters, good luck to them, too. It's not only hunters who can learn from
hunting.<p>

<font size=5><img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="T"></font>HE United States is on the verge of another great debate over immigration.
Thus far the focus of this still-inchoate debate has been on illegal
immigration or welfare benefits to legal immigrants, not on the larger issue of
the character and consequences of the current high levels of legal immigration.
Economic factors by themselves should not and will not decide the outcome of
this debate. But they will play an important role. Economics helps us to frame
answerable questions about immigration: Who gains by it? Who loses? And in
light of the answers to these questions, what should U.S. immigration policy 
be?<p>

There have been two major shifts in immigration policy in this century. In the
twenties the United States began to limit the number of immigrants admitted and
established the national-origins quota system, an allocation scheme that
awarded entry visas mainly on the basis of national origin and that favored
Germany and the United Kingdom. This system was repealed in 1965, and family
reunification became the central goal of immigration policy, with entry visas
being awarded mainly to applicants who had relatives already residing in the
United States.<p>

The social, demographic, and economic changes initiated by the <a 
href="http://www.fairus.org/history/03101603.htm">1965 legislation</a>
have been truly historic. The number of immigrants began to rise rapidly. As
recently as the 1950s only about 250,000 immigrants entered the country
annually; by the 1990s the United States was admitting more than 800,000 legal
immigrants a year, and some 300,000 aliens entered and stayed in the country
illegally. The 1965 legislation also led to a momentous shift in the ethnic
composition of the population. Although people of European origin dominated the
immigrant flow from the country's founding until the 1950s, only about 10
percent of those admitted in the 1980s were of European origin. It is now
estimated that non-Hispanic whites may form a minority of the population soon
after 2050. More troubling is that immigration has been linked to the increase
in income inequality observed since the 1980s, and to an increase in the costs
of maintaining the programs that make up the welfare state.<p>

These economic and demographic changes have fueled the incipient debate over
immigration policy. For the most part, the weapons of choice in this debate are
statistics produced by economic research, with all sides marshaling facts and
evidence that support particular policy goals. In this essay I ask a simple
question: What does economic research imply about the kind of immigration
policy that the United States should pursue?<p><br>


<h3>
<center><a name="RTFToC1">A
Formula for Admission
</a></center>
</h3>
<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/E-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="E"></font>VERY immigration policy must resolve two distinct issues: how many immigrants
the country should admit, and what kinds of people they should be.<p>

It is useful to view immigration policy as a formula that gives points to visa
applicants on the basis of various characteristics and then sets a passing
grade. The variables in the formula determine what kinds of people will be let
into the country, and the passing grade determines how many will be let into
the country. Current policy uses a formula that has one overriding variable:
whether the visa applicant has a family member already residing in the United
States. An applicant who has a relative in the country gets 100 points, passes
the test, and is admitted. An applicant who does not gets 0 points, fails the
test, and cannot immigrate legally.<p>

Of course, this is a simplistic summary of current policy. There are a lot of
bells and whistles in the immigration statutes (which are said to be only
slightly less complex than the tax code). In fact the number of points a person
gets may depend on whether the sponsor is a U.S. citizen or a permanent
resident, and whether the family connection is a close one (such as a parent, a
spouse, or a child) or a more distant one (a sibling). Such nuances help to
determine the speed with which the visa is granted. A limited number of visas
are given to refugees. Some are also distributed on the basis of skill
characteristics, but these go to only seven percent of immigrants. <p>

Although the United States does not officially admit to using a point system in
awarding entry visas, other countries proudly display their formulas on the
Internet. A comparison of these point systems reveals that the United States is
exceptional in using essentially one variable. Canada, Australia, and New
Zealand have more-complex formulas that include an applicant's educational
background, occupation, English-language proficiency, and age along with family
connections.<p>

Sometimes a host country awards points to people who are willing to pay the
visa's stated price. Canada, for example, has granted entry to virtually anyone
who would invest at least $250,000 in a Canadian business. Although this
"visas-for-sale" policy is a favorite proposal of economists (if we have a
market for butter, why not also a market for visas?), it is not taken very
seriously in the political debate, perhaps because policymakers feel a
repugnance against what may be perceived as a market for human beings. I will
therefore discuss the implications of economic research only for policies in
which points are awarded on the basis of socioeconomic characteristics, not
exchanged for dollars.<p><br>

<h3>
<center>
<a name="RTFToC2">What Have We Learned?
</a></center>
</h3>
<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="T"></font>HE academic literature investigating the economic impact of immigration on the
United States has grown rapidly in the past decade. The assumptions that long
dominated discussion of the costs and benefits of immigration were replaced
during the 1980s by a number of new questions, issues, and perceptions.<p>

Consider the received wisdom of the early 1980s. The studies available
suggested that even though immigrants arrived at an economic disadvantage,
their opportunities improved rapidly over time. Within a decade or two of
immigrants' arrival their earnings would overtake the earnings of natives of
comparable socioeconomic background. The evidence also suggested that
immigrants did no harm to native employment opportunities, and were less likely
to receive welfare assistance than natives. Finally, the children of immigrants
were even more successful than their parents. The empirical evidence,
therefore, painted a very optimistic picture of the contribution that
immigrants made to the American economy.<p>

In the past ten years this picture has altered radically. New research has
established a number of points.<p>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<li> The relative skills of successive immigrant waves have declined over much of
the postwar period. In 1970, for example, the latest immigrant arrivals on
average had 0.4 fewer years of schooling and earned 17 percent less than
natives. By 1990 the most recently arrived immigrants had 1.3 fewer years of
schooling and earned 32 percent less than natives.<p>

<li> Because the newest immigrant waves start out at such an economic
disadvantage, and because the rate of economic assimilation is not very rapid,
the earnings of the newest arrivals may never reach parity with the earnings of
natives. Recent arrivals will probably earn 20 percent less than natives
throughout much of their working lives.<p>

<li> The large-scale migration of less-skilled workers has done harm to the
economic opportunities of less-skilled natives. Immigration may account for
perhaps a third of the recent decline in the relative wages of less-educated
native workers.<p>

<li> The new immigrants are more likely to receive welfare assistance than earlier
immigrants, and also more likely to do so than natives: 21 percent of immigrant
households participate in some means-tested social-assistance program (such as
cash benefits, <a 
href="http://www.blueworld.com/milliman/publications/reports/understanding_medicaid/introduction.html">
Medicaid</a>, or food stamps), as compared with 14 percent of native
households.<p>

<li> The increasing welfare dependency in the immigrant population suggests that
immigration may create a substantial fiscal burden on the most-affected
localities and states.<p>

<li> There are economic benefits to be gained from immigration. These arise
because certain skills that immigrants bring into the country complement those
of the native population. However, these economic benefits are small -- perhaps
on the order of $7 billion annually.<p>

<li> There exists a strong correlation between the skills of immigrants and the
skills of their American-born children, so that the huge skill differentials
observed among today's foreign-born groups will almost certainly become
tomorrow's differences among American-born ethnic groups. In effect,
immigration has set the stage for sizable ethnic differences in skills and
socioeconomic outcomes, which are sure to be the focus of intense attention in
the next century.<p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


The United States is only beginning to observe the economic consequences of the
historic changes in the numbers, national origins, and skills of immigrants
admitted over the past three decades. Regardless of how immigration policy
changes in the near future, we have already set in motion circumstances that
will surely alter the economic prospects of native workers and the costs of
social-insurance programs not only in our generation but for our children and
grandchildren as well.<p><br>


<h3><center>
<a name="RTFToC3">Whose
Interests Will <a name="RTFToC4">We
Serve?
</a></center>
</h3>
<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/I-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="I"></font>F economic research is to play a productive role in the immigration debate,
research findings should help us to devise the formula that determines
admission into the United States. We need to decide what variables are to be
used to award points to applicants, and what is to be the passing grade. Before
we can resolve these issues, however, we have to address a difficult
philosophical question: What should the United States try to accomplish with
its immigration policy?<p>

The answer to this question is far from obvious, even when the question is
posed in purely economic terms. We can think of the world as composed of three
distinct groups: people born in the United States (natives), immigrants, and
people who remain in other countries. Whose economic welfare should the United
States try to improve when setting policy -- that of natives, of immigrants, of
the rest of the world, or of some combination of the three? The formula implied
by economic research depends on whose interests the United States cares most
about.<p>

Different political, economic, and moral arguments can be made in favor of each
of the three groups. I think that most participants in the U.S. policy debate
attach the greatest (and perhaps the only) weight to the well-being of natives.
This is not surprising. Natives dominate the market for political ideas in the
United States, and most proposals for immigration reform will unavoidably
reflect the self-interest and concerns of native voters.<p>

Immigration almost always improves the well-being of the immigrants. If they
don't find themselves better off after they enter the United States, they are
free to go back or to try their luck elsewhere -- and, indeed, some do. A few
observers attach great weight to the fact that many of the "huddled masses" now
live in relative comfort.<p>

As for the vast populations that remain in the source countries, they are
affected by U.S. immigration policy in a number of ways. Most directly, the
policy choices made by the United States may drain particular skills and
abilities from the labor markets of source countries. A brain drain slows
economic growth in the source countries, as the entrepreneurs and skilled
workers who are most likely to spur growth move to greener pastures. Similarly,
the principles of free trade suggest that world output would be largest if
there were no national borders to interfere with the free movement of people. A
policy that restricts workers from moving across borders unavoidably leads to a
smaller world economy, to the detriment of many source countries.<p>

The three groups may therefore have conflicting interests, and economics cannot
tell us whose interests matter most. The weight that we attach to each of the
three groups depends on our values and ideology. For the sake of argument I
will assume a political consensus that the objective of immigration policy is
to improve the economic well-being of the native population.<p>

Beyond that, we have to specify which dimension of native economic well-being
we care most about: per capita income or distribution of income. As we shall
see, immigration raises per capita income in the native population, but this
does not mean that all natives gain equally. In fact some natives are likely to
see their incomes greatly reduced. We must therefore be able to judge an
immigration policy in terms of its impact on two different economic dimensions:
the size of the economic pie (which economists call "efficiency") and how the
pie is sliced ("distribution"). The relative weights that we attach to
efficiency and distribution again depend on our values and ideology, and
economics provides no guidance on how to rank the two.<p>

For the most part, economists take a very narrow approach: policies that
increase the size of the pie are typically considered to be better policies,
regardless of their impact on the distribution of wealth in society. We shall
begin our construction of an immigration policy by taking this narrow approach.
In other words, let's assume that immigration policy has a single and
well-defined purpose: to maximize the size of the economic pie available to the
native population of the United States. We shall return to the distributional
issues raised by immigration policy later on.<p><br>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="T"></font>O see how natives gain from immigration, let's first think about how the
United States gains from foreign trade. When we import toys made by cheap
Chinese labor, workers in the American toy industry undoubtedly suffer wage
cuts and perhaps even lose their jobs. These losses, however, are more than
offset by the benefits accruing to consumers, who enjoy the lower prices
induced by additional competition. An important lesson from this exercise,
worth remembering when we look at the gains from immigration, is that for there
to be gains from foreign trade for the economy as a whole, some sectors of the
economy must lose.<p>

Consider the analogous argument for immigration. Immigrants increase the number
of workers in the economy. Because they create additional competition in the
labor market, the wages of native workers fall. At the same time, however,
native-owned firms gain, because they can hire workers at lower wages; and many
native consumers gain because lower labor costs lead to cheaper goods and
services. The gains accruing to those who consume immigrants' services exceed
the losses suffered by native workers, and hence society as a whole is better
off. <p>

Immigration therefore has two distinct consequences. The size of the economic
pie increases. And a redistribution of income is induced, from native workers
who compete with immigrant labor to those who use immigrants' services.<p>

The standard economic model of the labor market suggests that the net gain from
immigration is small. The United States now has more than 20 million
foreign-born residents, making up slightly less than 10 percent of the
population. I have estimated that native workers lose about $133 billion a year
as a result of this immigration (or 1.9 percent of the gross domestic product
in a $7 trillion economy), mainly because immigrants drive down wages. However,
employers -- from the owners of large agricultural enterprises to people who hire
household help -- gain on the order of $140 billion (or 2.0 percent of GDP). The
net gain, which I call the immigration surplus, is only about $7 billion. Thus
the increase in the per capita income of natives is small -- less than $30 a
year. But the small size of this increase masks a substantial redistribution of
wealth.<p>

My calculation used the textbook model of a competitive labor market: wages and
employment are determined in a free market that balances the desires of people
looking for work with the needs of firms looking for workers. In this framework
an increase in the number of workers reduces wages in the economy -- immigrants
join natives in the competition for jobs and bid down wages in the process.
There is a lot of disagreement over how much native wages fall when immigrants
enter the labor market. Nevertheless, a great deal of empirical research in
economics, often unrelated to the question of immigration, concludes that a 10
percent increase in the number of workers lowers wages by about three
percent.<p>

If we accept this finding, we can argue as follows: We know that about 70
percent of GDP accrues to workers (with the rest going to the owners of
companies), and that natives make up slightly more than 90 percent of the
population. Therefore, native workers take home about 63 percent of GDP in the
form of wages and salaries. If the 10 percent increase in the number of workers
due to immigration has lowered wages by three percent, the share of GDP
accruing to native workers has fallen by 1.9 percentage points (or 0.63 x
0.03). Thus my conclusion that in a $7 trillion economy native earnings drop by
$133 billion.<p>

Those lost earnings do not vanish into thin air. They represent an income
transfer from workers to users of immigrants' services -- the employers of
immigrants and the consumers who buy the goods and services produced by
immigrants. These winners get to pocket the $133 billion -- and then some,
because the goods produced by immigrant workers generate additional profits for
employers. Under the assumption that a 10 percent increase in the number of
workers reduces wages by three percent, it turns out that the winners get a
windfall totaling $140 billion. Hence the $7 billion immigration surplus.<p>

We can quibble about assumptions, but the rigor of economic theory suggests
that this nitpicking may not alter our conclusions much. For example, one could
argue -- and many do -- that immigrants do not reduce the earnings of native
workers. If we wished to believe this, however, we would also be forced to
conclude that natives do not benefit from immigration at all. If wages do not
fall, there are no savings in employers' payrolls and no cost savings to be
passed on to native consumers. Remember the lesson from the foreign-trade
example: no pain, no gain.<p>

One could also argue that immigration has reduced the earnings of natives
very substantially -- by, say, 10 percent. The immigration surplus would then be
about $25 billion annually. The net gain from immigration, therefore, remains
small even with an unrealistically high estimate of the impact of immigration
on native earnings. Imagine what U.S. policy would look like today if our
earnings had fallen by 10 percent as a result of past immigration.<p>

The immigration surplus has to be balanced against the cost of providing
services to the immigrant population. Immigrants have high rates of welfare
recipiency. Estimates of the fiscal impact of immigration (that is, of the
difference between the taxes paid by immigrants and the cost of services
provided to them) vary widely. Some studies claim that immigrants pay $25-$30
billion more in taxes than they take out of the system, while other studies
blame them for a fiscal burden of more than $40 billion on natives.<p>

It is doubtful that either of these statistics accurately reflects the gap
between taxes paid and the cost of services provided. Studies that claim a
beneficial fiscal impact tend to assume that immigrants do not increase the
cost of most government programs other than education and welfare. Even though
we do not know by how much immigrants increase the cost of police protection,
maintaining roads and national parks, and so forth, we do know that it costs
more to provide these services to an ever larger population. However, studies
that claim a large fiscal burden often overstate the costs of immigration and
understate the taxes paid. As a result, estimates of the fiscal impact of
immigration should be viewed with suspicion. Nevertheless, because the
immigration surplus is around $7 billion, the net benefit from immigration
after accounting for the fiscal impact is very small, and could conceivably be
a net loss.<p><br>

<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/I-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="I"></font>N principle, we should admit immigrants whenever their economic contribution
(to native well-being) will exceed the costs of providing social services to
them. We are not, though, in a position to make this calculation with any
reasonable degree of confidence. In fact, no mainstream study has ever
attempted to suggest, purely on the basis of the empirical evidence, how many
immigrants should be admitted.<p>

This unfortunate lack of guidance from economic research has, I believe, led to
sudden and remarkable swings in policy proposals. As recently as 1990 Congress
legislated an increase in the number of legal immigrants of about 175,000
people annually. Last year the <a 
href="http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/uscir/">Commission on Immigration 
Reform</a>, headed by Barbara Jordan, recommended that legal immigration be 
cut by about 240,000
people a year -- a proposal that was immediately supported by President Clinton.
(The Clinton Administration, however, successfully resisted congressional
efforts to follow up on the commission's recommendations.)<p>

Although we do not know how many immigrants to admit, simple economics and
common sense suggest that the magic number should not be an immutable constant
regardless of economic conditions in the United States. A good case can be made
for linking immigration to the business cycle: admit more immigrants when the
economy is strong and the unemployment rate is low, and cut back on immigration
when the economy is weak and the unemployment rate is high.<p>

Economic research also suggests that the United States may be better off if its
policy of awarding entry visas favors skilled workers. Skilled immigrants earn
more than less-skilled immigrants, and hence pay more in taxes, and they are
less likely to use welfare and other social services.<p>

Depending on how the skills of immigrants compare with the skills of natives,
immigrants also affect the productivity of the native work force and of
native-owned companies. Skilled native workers, for example, have much to gain
when less-skilled workers enter the United States: they can devote all their
efforts to jobs that use their skills effectively while immigrants provide
cheap labor for service jobs. These gains, however, come at a cost. The jobs of
less-skilled natives are now at risk, and these natives will suffer a reduction
in their earnings. Nonetheless, it does not seem far-fetched to assume that the
American work force, particularly in comparison with the work forces of many
source countries, is composed primarily of skilled workers. Thus the typical
American worker would seem to gain from unskilled immigration.<p>

How does immigration affect companies' profits? Companies that use less-skilled
workers on the production line gain from the immigration of the less-skilled,
who reduce the earnings of less-skilled workers in favor of increasing profits.
However, other companies -- perhaps even most -- might be better off with skilled
immigrants. Many studies in economics suggest that skilled labor is better
suited to the machines that are now used widely in the production process. Most
companies would therefore gain more if the immigrant flow were composed of
skilled workers.<p>

Most workers prefer unskilled immigrants, whereas most companies prefer skilled
immigrants. This conflict can be resolved only by measuring how much native
workers gain from unskilled immigration and how much companies gain from
skilled immigration, and comparing the two. Although there is a lot of
uncertainty in the academic literature, we do know that the productivity of
capital is very responsive to an influx of skilled workers. The large increase
in the profits of the typical company, and the corresponding reduction in the
cost of goods produced by skilled workers, suggest that the United States might
be better off with a policy favoring skilled immigrants.<p>

The gains from skilled immigration will be even larger if immigrants have
"external effects" on the productivity of natives. One could argue, for
example, that immigrants may bring knowledge, skills, and abilities that
natives lack, and that natives might somehow pick up this know-how by
interacting with immigrants. It seems reasonable to suspect that the value of
these external effects would be greater if natives interact with highly skilled
immigrants. This increase in the human capital of natives might offset -- and
perhaps even reverse -- the harm that immigration does to the wages of competing
workers.<p>

Although such effects now play a popular role in economic theory, there is
little empirical evidence supporting their existence, let alone measuring their
magnitude. I find it difficult to imagine that interaction with immigrants
entering an economy as large as that of the United States could have a
measurable effect. Nevertheless, if external effects exist, they reinforce the
argument that the United States would gain most from skilled 
immigrants.<p><br>

<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/P-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="P"></font>ARTICIPANTS in the immigration debate routinely use the results of economic
research to frame the discussion and to suggest policy solutions. Perhaps the
most important contributions of this research are the insights that immigration
entails both gains and losses for the native population, that the winners and
the losers are typically different groups, and that policy parameters can be
set in ways that attempt to maximize gains and minimize losses. If the
objective of immigration policy is to increase the per capita income of the
native population, the evidence suggests that immigration policy should
encourage the entry of skilled workers. It is important to remember, however,
that even though the immigration of skilled workers would be beneficial for the
United States as a whole, the gains and losses would be concentrated in
particular subgroups of the population.<p>
 
As we have seen, the net gains from current immigration are small, so it is
unlikely that these gains can play a crucial role in the policy debate.
Economic research teaches a very valuable lesson: the economic impact of
immigration is essentially distributional. Current immigration redistributes
wealth from unskilled workers, whose wages are lowered by immigrants, to
skilled workers and owners of companies that buy immigrants' services, and from
taxpayers who bear the burden of paying for the social services used by
immigrants to consumers who use the goods and services produced by immigrants.
<p>

Distributional issues drive the political debate over many social policies, and
immigration policy is no exception. The debate over immigration policy is not a
debate over whether the entire country is made better off by immigration -- the
gains from immigration seem much too small, and could even be outweighed by the
costs of providing increased social services. Immigration changes how the
economic pie is sliced up -- and this fact goes a long way toward explaining why
the debate over how many and what kinds of immigrants to admit is best viewed
as a tug-of-war between those who gain from immigration and those who lose from
it.<p>

History has taught us that immigration policy changes rarely, but when it does,
it changes drastically. Can economic research play a role in finding a better
policy? I believe it can, but there are dangers ahead. Although the pendulum
seems to be swinging to the restrictionist side (with ever louder calls for a
complete closing of our borders), a greater danger to the national interest may
be the few economic groups that gain much from immigration. They seem
indifferent to the costs that immigration imposes on other segments of society,
and they have considerable financial incentives to keep the current policy in
place. The harmful effects of immigration will not go away simply because some
people do not wish to see them. In the short run these groups may simply delay
the day of reckoning. Their potential long-run impact, however, is much more
perilous: the longer the delay, the greater the chances that when immigration
policy finally changes, it will undergo a seismic shift -- one that, as in the
twenties, may come close to shutting down the border and preventing Americans
from enjoying the benefits that a well-designed immigration policy can bestow
on the United States.

<blockquote>
	
	<font size=5>B</font><font size=3>USES and trucks barrel down Mirpur Road, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, blasting their
horns and leaving trails of black smoke to settle on rickshaws and oxcarts. By
the side of the road a high brick wall encircles four buildings in a compound,
one of which is dominated by a tropical garden that opens to the sky. On many
afternoons rain falls into the garden, and at their desks accountants can pause
to listen to the sound of water slapping leaves. This is the head office of a
bank that does its work in the countryside.<p>
Thousands of visitors have traveled to <A HREF="http://path.upmc.edu/~ahmed/bdpage.html">Bangladesh</A> to learn from this bank, and
many arrive carrying tape recorders and note pads. When they enter the office,
they find no receptionist, no carpets, no elevators, and few telephones. The
rooms are equipped with ceiling fans, manual typewriters, paperweights, and
stacks of ledgers. Only the computer room, on the fifth floor, is
air-conditioned. Here programmers monitor operations and prepare reports, which
they love to fill with wild-looking graphs depicting their organization's
growth. The graphs all look basically the same: like ski hills, rising slowly
at first, and then shooting up at impossibly steep angles toward the sky.<p>

For two decades the <A HREF="http://www.halcyon.com/fkroger/six1l.html">Grameen ("Village") Bank</A> has been extending small loans for
self-employment purposes to some of the poorest people on earth--landless women
in Bangladesh--and its financial performance has never been stronger. The
bank's founder, the Bangladeshi economist Muhammad Yunus, continues to win
international honors--the 1992 King Baudouin Development Prize, the 1993 CARE
Humanitarian Award for Development, the 1994 World Food Prize--but his bank is
hardly a one-man show. Grameen's loans are administered by more than 10,000
university and high school graduates scattered throughout Bangladesh--no small
organizational feat in a country notorious for corruption and mismanagement, a
country that since its birth, in 1971, has absorbed more than $25 billion in
foreign aid and seen the majority of its citizens grow poorer.<p>

			<A HREF="./grameenb.htm"><img src="./grameens.gif" align=right hspace=10 
			vspace=10 alt="" border=0></A>


The Grameen Bank, once dubbed the "barefoot bank," can no longer be described
in quaint terms. With more than 1,050 branch offices that serve 35,000 villages
and two million customers, 94 percent of them women, Grameen is the largest
rural lender in Bangladesh, and the proportion of its loans that are repaid, 97
percent, is comparable to the repayment rate at Chase Manhattan Bank. Last
year, after eighteen years of making small loans, Grameen had disbursed more
than $1 billion; at the present rate the bank will cross the $2 billion mark
sometime next year. "It's like McDonald's," Yunus says. "People know the
quality of our service. Our job at head office is to make sure it doesn't
deteriorate in any corner of the country." <p>

Given that Grameen's banking system is based on trust and mutual
accountability, that is quite a task. To qualify for a loan, a villager must
demonstrate that her family assets fall <i>below</i> the bank's threshold. She
will not be required to put up collateral; instead she must join a five-member
group and a forty-member center and attend a meeting every week, and she must
assume responsibility for the loans of her group's members. This is crucial,
because it is the group--not the bank--that initially evaluates loan proposals.
Defaulters spoil things for everybody else, so group members choose their
partners wisely. If all five repay their loans promptly, each is guaranteed
access to credit for the rest of her life--or as long as she elects to remain a
customer. In this fashion Grameen is faithful to the Latin from which
"credit" derives: <i>credere </i>--"to believe."<p>

"The myth that credit is the privilege of a few fortunate people needs to be
exploded," Yunus explains. "You look at the tiniest village, and the tiniest
person in that village: a very capable person, a very intelligent person. You
have only to create the proper environment to support these people so that they
can change their own lives."<p>

Pure idealism? Well, yes. Nonetheless, these words come from a man who has
designed a bank that forces its borrowers to save money for emergencies,
provides them with benefits in the event of death, and is in the process of
instituting a village-based health-care and insurance program, which will be
self-financing. Today, against the backdrop of two and a half decades of
often-wasted international aid, <A HREF="http://www.tuns.ca/~abidmr/text/grameen.txt">Grameen's entrepreneurial approach</A> stands out
as singularly effective and sustainable. Up to 1994 the bank had revolved its
loan capital more than five times. Along the way it helped millions of
villagers to move from one or two meals a day to three, from one or two sets of
clothing to three or four. Grameen members have borrowed money to pay for their
children's education, to buy medicine, to build houses, to accumulate assets
for old age, and--like the peddler Oirashibala Dhor--to pay for their
daughters' weddings.<p>

<font size=5>I</font><font size=3>NSIDE, the mud walls were smooth to the touch. Above a table hung a framed
birth certificate and a political-campaign poster featuring the party's logo--a
riverboat. Another wall was decorated with yellowed pages from <i>USA
Today</i>.<p> 

Oirashibala Dhor set her basket on the ground beside my translator. She
appeared to be constructed entirely of angles--knees and elbows jutting sharply
from beneath her plain white sari. Her hair was silver, her brow deeply
creased, and she had only half her teeth. She was born, as she put it, "before
the British-Japanese war of 1943."<p>

Whispers could be heard from behind a bamboo screen. Two young sisters and an
older woman emerged, and were joined by several neighbors and their children.
Oirashi, as everyone calls her, took up a red capsule from her basket. "Lip
gloss," she announced. "You put this over lipstick, your lips shine."<p>

"How much is the lip gloss?" a young girl asked. "Give it to me for six
takas."<p>

Another girl, browsing through Oirashi's basket, inquired, "How much is this
hair clip?"<p>

"Don't be so extravagant," her mother said.<p>

The girl dropped the hair clip and picked up a jar of Fair and Lovely beauty
cream, which promised "noticeably fairer" skin in six to eight weeks.<p>

"That's for older people," Oirashi said. She selected a glass bangle, polished
it with her sari, and asked the girl if she liked the color. The girl nodded.
Oirashi requested soap and water. She wet the girl's tiny wrist and then
squeezed and twisted until the bangle slid on. The girl extended her arm to
show her mother. Children at the door pressed forward to see.<p>

"Stop blocking the door," an older woman yelled. "Let the breeze in."<p>

"Nowadays children are so disrespectful."<p>

"Please give me the lip gloss for three takas less," the first girl said, her
final plea.<p>

"Don't kill me," Oirashi replied.<p>

Oirashi has been supporting herself and her two daughters since the death of
her husband, twenty-five years ago. "He died of frozen Satan's gout," she told
me on my recent visit to her village. "Nowadays the doctors call it pneumonia."
Every morning except Sunday, when her Grameen Bank meeting is scheduled, she
gets up with the sun, offers a prayer, places her basket on her head, and sets
out to sell her wares. She walks for miles. Though she sells sandals, she never
wears them. I asked her why.<p>

"I'm just a simple peddler," she replied. "How can I be seen wearing sandals?"
<p>

As Oirashi walked along the narrow partitions separating rice plots, she
drummed on her thighs. I asked about the basket balanced on her head. "It's not
heavy," she replied. We approached a cluster of huts situated atop a mud
plateau that rose four feet above the bristling green field. "Those are all
Grameen Bank house loans," she explained. "All the old houses were washed away
in the [1991] cyclone."<p>

Several women waved. "These women have become a lot braver because of the
Grameen Bank," Oirashi said. "Previously, if any strange man came, they would
go into their houses and sit behind the <A HREF="http://www.idt.unit.no/~isfit/speeches/nasrin.html">purdah</A>" (literally, "veil";
figuratively, the Muslim code of conduct that confines women to their
homesteads). "Now they come out and they talk."<p>

Oirashi passed by one woman who called her over. "I'll only come if you cook me
a hen," Oirashi joked. She had no time to waste with nonbuyers, she said.
"People take a lot of time picking and choosing from my basket. If I could go
to more places, I'd be rich."<p>

Oirashi's overriding concern is finding a husband for her second daughter, who
is in her mid-twenties and still unmarried. In Bangladesh daughters usually
move in with the families of their husbands after marriage. Oirashi's first
daughter lives ten miles away. But Oirashi doesn't want to be left alone in her
old age. This time she is looking for a <i>ghor jamai</i>: a son-in-law who
agrees to live in his mother-in-law's house. Finding one is not easy; most men
look down on the idea. Oirashi knows that if her plan has a hope, she must
sweeten the pot. She will have to come up with a sizable dowry and expand her
house.<p>

"When I have all the jewelry and money," she explained, "then I will tell my
elder daughter and her husband to find a boy. After they have found one, I will
go and see for myself. If I like him, then the wedding will take place."<p>

"Will you ask your daughter's consent?" I asked.<p>

"Of course," Oirashi said. "Is this my marriage?"<p>

The wedding (dowry included) will cost more than 15,000 takas (about $375). For
many villagers such a sum represents two or three years' income. Oirashi has
been working to save it for the better part of a decade. Fortunately, in the
past few years her peddling sales have increased. Oirashi often sells on
credit, but when she buys merchandise in the bazaars, she does better to pay
cash. Cash flow had always been her major business constraint. To overcome it,
Oirashi joined the Grameen Bank. In six years her annual borrowing increased
from about $60.00 to about $260. Each loan was for one year, payable in fifty
equal weekly installments, with annual interest of 20 percent (calculated on a
declining principal) due in the last two weeks. After her house was destroyed
in the cyclone, Oirashi also assumed a $375 long-term mortgage, at eight
percent interest, to rebuild it.<p>

Like all retailers, with cash in hand she found herself in a stronger position.
She could haggle with vendors over price, stock higher-quality merchandise, and
take advantage of volume discounts. Before the Grameen Bank came along, Oirashi
borrowed from moneylenders, whose interest rates ranged from 10 to 20 percent a
month. "Now I always buy with cash," Oirashi explained. "Look--I do my business
for profit."<p>
<pre>

</pre>
<font size=5>F</font><font size=3>OR the thousands of men and women who staff the Grameen Bank, the story of
their organization's birth has the resonance of myth. One afternoon in 1976
Muhammad Yunus was taking a walk in a village a mile from Chittagong
University, where he was the head of the Department of Economics, when he
encountered a woman weaving bamboo stools.<p> 

Yunus had returned to Bangladesh in 1972, after the country had become
independent. Prior to that he had spent seven years in Nashville, Tennessee,
completing a Ph.D. at Vanderbilt University. Yunus had been influenced by the
student activism of the late 1960s, especially the civil-rights movement, and
the message he carried home was that it was possible for young people to change
society. As a professor of economics in Bangladesh, he asked his students if,
for all their knowledge of equations and formulas, they really knew how 90
percent of the people in their country lived. He challenged them to close their
textbooks and get involved with local villagers, and for four years he spent
his afternoons with them in villages, studying the informal economy, organizing
immunization programs, and helping local farmers to grow more food.<p>

Yunus had never met Sufiya Khatun on his many walks through her village.
Sufiya, a widow, was trying to support herself by constructing and selling
bamboo stools. She earned two cents a day. When Yunus asked why her profit was
so low, she explained that the only person who would lend her money to buy
bamboo was the trader who bought her final product--and the price he set barely
covered her costs.<p>

Yunus's instinct was to dig into his pocket. But first he wanted to see if
there were other villagers in similar circumstances. He and a few students
canvassed the village and compiled a list of forty-two people whose capital
requirements, in order to buy materials and work freely, added up to about
$26.00.<p>

Through the years he would recount that story hundreds of times. A decade
later, testifying before the U.S. Congress Select Committee on Hunger in a
hearing devoted to micro-enterprise credit, he recalled what had gone through
his mind: "I felt extremely ashamed of myself being part of a society that
could not provide twenty-six dollars to forty-two able, skilled human beings
who were trying to make a living."<p>

He gave his graduate students the money and instructed them to distribute it to
the villagers. He arranged for the loans to be repaid in small installments at
a local tea stall. A short time later he felt dissatisfied. "They couldn't come
to me every time they needed money," he said. Where should villagers be able to
go when they needed a loan?<p>

Yunus paid a visit to the manager of a local bank. "He gave me a big laugh," he
recalls. "He said the amounts were not worth the paperwork." Most of the
villagers were illiterate, the manager explained, and they had nothing to offer
as collateral. No bank lent money to people without collateral.<p>

Two years later, with his graduate students, Yunus established the first branch
of the Grameen Bank. Conscious of the dismal performance of credit cooperatives
in Bangladesh, he resolved to be different on three counts: First, the loans
were to be repaid, and on time. Second, only the poorest villagers--the
landless--were eligible. Third, he would make an effort to lend money primarily
to women, who were socially, as well as economically, impoverished.<p>

With support from the Bangladesh Bank, the Ford Foundation, and the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), an aid organization
created by the United Nations, Grameen was by 1983 an independent bank
operating eighty-six branches and serving 58,000 clients. As it grew popular
enough to surmount religious opposition, the bank began providing loans almost
exclusively to women. "When a woman brings in income," Yunus explains, "the
immediate beneficiaries are her children."<p>

The following year, after years of development washouts, foreign donors began
taking Yunus very seriously. In 1984-1985 IFAD, Ford, and the governments of
Norway and Sweden stepped in with $38 million in low-cost loans. By 1988
Grameen had 501 branches and 490,000 borrowers. In 1989 Canada and Germany
joined the team of donors, and the bank received an additional $87 million. In
1992 Grameen opened its thousandth branch office. It also raised credit
ceilings and introduced various new kinds of loans intended to boost revenues.
In the past three years disbursements have soared to $40 million a <i>month,
</i>with only a marginal increase in staff. Grameen has moved, as one manager
puts it, "from Mach one to Mach two."
<pre>

</pre>
<font size=5>T</font><font size=3>YPICALLY, Americans are reluctant to look to other countries for help with
their social problems. Think of health care. However, as the current political
debate rages over how big government should be, Grameen's experiences are more
relevant to the United States than ever before. The Grameen Bank has received
praise from U.S. commentators and policymakers on both the left and the right.
Being Bangladeshi, it has the advantage of being seen as a perennial underdog.
And, no doubt, the bank speaks to something at the core of the American ideal:
what Ralph Waldo Emerson called "the heroism and grandeur which belong to acts
of self-reliance." <p>

Grameen is a political chameleon: it has the ability to affirm beliefs that
both conservatives and liberals hold dear. From the right Grameen can be seen
as an entrepreneurial institution that makes the case for less government; from
the left it appears to be an enlightened social-welfare program that argues for
the value of government involvement. Some see Grameen as an example of
reinvented government. Muhammad Yunus disagrees. He sees his bank as an example
of reinvented capitalism. In fact, he calls it a "socially conscious capitalist
enterprise."<p>

Consider: the Grameen Bank charges interest four points above the commercial
rate. It never forgives loans, not even after a flood or a cyclone, although it
restructures them when necessary. It provides no free services to its
borrowers, charging fees even when it distributes such essential items as
water-purification crystals, vegetable seeds, and iodized salt. Although the
bank has received tens of millions of dollars in grants and low-cost loans from
foreign governments, it remains a private enterprise, with 90 percent of its
shares controlled by its two million borrowers. For all its efforts to contain
costs, Grameen remains committed to a clientele that is inherently expensive to
serve--a clientele that in the absence of an ethical imperative would probably
never have been discovered by the free market. <p>

Today Grameen's annual report lists more than 400 different kinds of businesses
initiated by borrowers, who husk rice or make ice-cream sticks, trade in brass
or repair radios, process mustard oil or cultivate jackfruit. For each activity
the bank lists the number and amounts of loans disbursed. It would be a
commercial banker's nightmare.<p>

As a rule, the statistics on which Grameen prides itself most--volume of
customers and disbursements--do not excite bankers. Two million small,
short-term loans are much more expensive to manage than a few big, long-term
loans. Bankers care about the costs and revenues associated with a loan
portfolio. But in this area Grameen is also fast gathering strength. The bank's
operating income jumped from $19 million in 1992 to almost $50 million in 1994,
and is expected to exceed $60 million this year. In five of the past seven
years Grameen has reported small profits, which are reinvested in its revolving
loan fund; however, analysts are quick to point out that those profits are not
"real," because the bank has received its funding at concessionary rates.<p>

But recently Grameen has taken a number of decisions to demonstrate that it is
serious about being seen as a capitalist enterprise: It has declined donor
funds in favor of $150 million in loans at the bank rate from the Bangladesh
Bank, and in the past two years has raised $125 million through bond issues.
Despite much higher interest expenses, Grameen continues to report profits. The
bank has begun providing an early-retirement option for older employees, to cut
salaries; and, to reduce overhead further, it is testing computers in branches
with access to electricity. As borrowers mature, they become more stable and
their demand for credit increases. Down the road, if Grameen can shift from
weekly to, say, biweekly installments and still maintain its rate of loan
repayment, administrative costs will drop by a third without affecting
revenues. <p>

Laissez-faire or interventionist? Either way, Grameen is a performer--which is
why, this past July, the <A HREF="http://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</A> broke with its tradition of financing
primarily large-scale infrastructure-development projects by launching a drive
to raise more than $200 million for Grameen-style lending, and why, over the
past few years, many Americans have attempted to tackle poverty in the United
States in similar ways. Part of a movement some call the "first Third World
technology transfer," the Association for Enterprise Opportunity, a network of
<A HREF="http://www.oneworld.org/beijing/yunus.html">micro-enterprise</A> development organizations established in 1991, lists 400
members across the country. Yunus is excited by the spread of these programs.
"If the United States becomes convinced that poverty can be eliminated," he
told me, "then it can be done."<p>

But given the canyon of cultural and economic differences separating the two
countries, the technology transfer poses difficulties. To begin with,
Bangladesh has a long tradition of self-employment. By comparison, very few
Americans--not even one in ten--work for themselves, and low-income Americans
who wish to be self-employed typically require training, technical assistance,
and, perhaps most important, access to business networks along with credit. <p>

One of the veteran micro-enterprise programs in the United States, begun in
1986, is the Women's Self-Employment Project, in Chicago. WSEP has extended
close to $1 million in loans to more than 300 businesses and has offered
business-counseling services to 5,000 women. Its repayment rate is 93 percent.
Mary Houghton, the president of Shorebank Corporation, which oversees the
project, believes that WSEP has demonstrated that there is "a big market in
Chicago for self-employment among single women who are either very low-income
or on welfare." Micro-bankers have yet to develop a systematic, self-sustaining
methodology for turning low-income Americans into successful businesspeople,
she told me recently, "but they've discovered a fair number of ways by which
people can add to their incomes by two or five or ten thousand dollars a
year."<p>

Because of the high cost of training and the low disbursements, to date no
micro-enterprise lender in the United States has come close to breaking even,
and only a handful have more than a few hundred borrowers. The people running
these programs prefer to avoid comparisons with the Grameen Bank; many have
abandoned the hope of achieving financial self-sufficiency. Instead they defend
their program costs by framing the issue in terms of social justice, arguing
that every American, rich or poor, should be entitled to a limited quantity of
resources on loan, at the commercial rate or higher, provided that he or she
demonstrates commitment, a desire to work, and what appears to be a viable
business plan. <p>

An attractive idea--but is it politically feasible? One of those who think not
is Jeffrey Ashe, the director of Working Capital, based in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. Ashe worked in micro-enterprise in South America, Africa, and
Asia for more than a decade before he founded Working Capital, in late 1990, to
provide group-based support, credit, training, and technical assistance to
low-income people throughout New England. Unlike the Grameen Bank and other
micro-enterprise programs, Working Capital does not target the poorest of the
poor. Its market, best described as "the entrepreneurial poor," is made up of
people already involved in income-generating activities who lack access to
financial resources and other support services. However, like Yunus, Ashe does
not attempt to turn poor people into entrepreneurs; he supports people who are
already entrepreneurs, or at least show promising signs of soon becoming
entrepreneurs. In this sense he is, in his approach, closer to Yunus's
pragmatic spirit than are micro-lenders who target poorer clients. Writing in
the July, 1994, issue of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, Amitai Etzioni argued
that it is "wise policy" for social programs to seek early success by starting
with a "realistic notion of human transformation"--in this case, not expecting
poor people just to go out and start viable businesses. Ashe agrees. In five
years Working Capital has extended $1.5 million in loans, of amounts ranging
from $500 to $5,000, to more than 1,100 businesses; its repayment rate is 98
percent.<p>

Ashe is unique among his colleagues in his determination to demonstrate that it
is possible to be a banker for poor Americans and still cover costs. "Almost
everybody has rejected this out of hand," he told me recently. "But the truth
is, for these programs to reach any appreciable scale, we have to show that
they can be self-sustaining. And if we can prove that, we can blow this whole
movement to another level."<p>

"I figure that micro-enterprise in this country has a window of opportunity for
the next four or five years," he added. "Right now there's interest among
funders, but already major questions about cost-effectiveness are being
raised."<p>

Ashe has plans to franchise his operation, to support as many as 4,000
businesses by the end of 1997, and has started franchises in Delaware and South
Miami. His cost per borrower continues to drop; it is somewhere between 10 and
20 percent of the cost in other programs; and he is looking for new ways to
increase revenues, including raising the loan ceiling to $10,000 and charging
membership fees to groups. He projects that with an investment today of $5
million over five years, Working Capital could generate $60 million in new jobs
by the end of the sixth year and could break even in the seventh year.<p>

"People latch on to the concept of micro-enterprise pretty fast," Ashe said,
"but the trick is actually designing a structure that will produce sustainable
results. More and more, as I slog through this on a day-to-day basis, I
appreciate what Yunus has accomplished."<p>

	<h4>Q&amp;A</h4>

	

	<b><i>Why don't stutterers ever stutter when they sing?</b></i><p>

	

Stutterers have a genetic predisposition to focus tension in their vocal 

cords, which may lock; stuttering is the attempt to unlock them.  A 

singer's vocal cords are in constant motion, without the chance to tense 

up.  In addition, singing, in which syllables are more elongated than in 

speech, moves the vocal cords differently.  The anticipatory stress that 

exacerbates stuttering is less likely to occur during singing, because 

people tend to focus on the music more than on the words.  And finally, 

music originates in the right side of the brain, and speech in the left; 

there may be little neurological connection between speaking and singing.  

At least one well-known figure used music to avert stuttering: <A 

HREF="http://www.empirenet.com/~rdaeley/authors/churchill.html">Winston 

Churchill</A> would hum before making speeches. [Hear a sound clip from 

Churchill's <A

	<h4>Environment</h4>

	

					<img src="./environ.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>



	

	March <b>1</b>, Californians may literally breathe a bit easier after 

	today, the deadline by which the state's oil refineries must produce a 

	cleaner-burning reformulated gasoline (RFG).  By June 1 this will be the 

	only gasoline sold at California's pumps.  The new fuel will reduce 

	emissions of toxic compounds by 30 to 40 percent and emissions of 

	smog-forming compounds by 15 percent, making it twice as clean as an RFG 

	that, owing to an Environmental Protection Agency mandate, has been in use 

	in the nation's most polluted areas since January of last year.  

	<A HREF="http://www.arb.ca.gov/">California's Air Resources Board</A> estimates that introducing the new 

	gasoline will have the same effect as removing 3.5 million vehicles from 

	the state's roads.<p>

	

	<br clear=all>

	

	

	<h4>Food</h4>

	

					<img src="./food.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>



	

	Sea turtles begin nesting along the country's southeast coast this month, 

	which means poachers will be combing the beaches in search of turtle eggs.  

	The <A HREF="http://www.fws.gov/~r9endspp/endspp.html">Endangered Species Act of 1973</A> bans the possession and sale of 

	sea-turtle eggs; nonetheless, a lucrative trade persists.  The eggs, 

	considered a delicacy and believed by some to be an aphrodisiac, sell for 

	up to $3 apiece on the black market; a single nest may contain as many as 

	150.  Sea-turtle eggs have long been part of the Caribbean diet, and some 

	immigrants from the region and from Central America still enjoy eating 

	them; in some Florida bars and restaurants the eggs are served in shot 

	glasses with liquor and Tabasco sauce, or as an off-the-menu special.  They 

	have long been used in southern cooking as well, especially in soups and 

	baked goods.  Poaching is not the only human hazard to threaten sea turtles 

	and their eggs; pollution, shrimp nets, and coastal development also pose 

	problems.<p>

	

	<br clear=all>

	

	

	<h4>Government</h4>

	

					<img src="./gov.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>



	

This year's presidential candidates have a lot at stake this month, when 

some 60 percent of <A HREF="http://www.rnc.org/">Republican</A> delegates and 70 percent of <A 

HREF="http://www.democrats.org/">Democratic</A> ones will be chosen.  

Primaries or caucuses will be held on March <b>2</b> (South Carolina, for 

Republicans only); <b>5</b> (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode 

Island, and Vermont--New England is trying to increase its political 

influence--and also Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, and, for 

Democrats only, Idaho, South Carolina, and Washington); <b>7</b> (New York 

and, for Democrats only, Missouri); <b>9</b> (Alaska, Arizona, and South 

Dakota, all for Democrats only); <b>10</b> (Nevada, for Democrats only); 

<b>12</b> "Super Tuesday" (Florida; for Democrats only, Hawaii and 

Louisiana; Mississippi; Oklahoma; Oregon, which will become the first state 

to conduct its primary by mail; Tennessee; and Texas); <b>16</b> (Michigan, 

for Democrats only); <b>19</b> (Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, and, for 

Republicans only, Michigan); <b>23</b> (Wyoming, for Democrats only); 

<b>25</b> (Utah, for Democrats only); and <b>26</b> (California and, for 

Republicans only, Washington and Nevada; Nevada's primary will also be 

conducted by mail).<p>

	<h4>Health &amp; Safety</h4>

	

					<img src="./health.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>



	

	March ushers in spring and with it an active breeding season for many 

	rabies hosts, including raccoons, foxes, coyotes, and skunks; as a result, 

	the infection rate among these animals begins to surge.  The disease has 

	been rampant in U.S.  wildlife since the late 1970s; however, the number of 

	reported cases dipped by more than 10 percent in 1994, the last year for 

	which figures have been tallied.  State-run rabies-control programs and a 

	new practice of scattering edible rabies vaccinations may be partly 

	responsible for the decline.  Raccoon rabies, the most notorious strain, 

	has been making its way north from Florida for nearly 50 years; it reached 

	Maine in 1994.  However, in the past three years only 13 people in the 

	United States have died of rabies, and most of these deaths have been 

	attributed to bat strains of the virus.<p>

	<h4>The Skies</h4>

	

					<img src="./skies.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>



	

	March <b>5</b>, Full Moon, also known this month as the Lenten, Sap, and 

	Crow Moon.  <b>20</b>, at 3:03 A.M.  EST the Vernal Equinox occurs, marking 

	the start of spring.  Wise gardeners sow their peas.  <b>22</b>, Venus, 

	which appears as the bright evening star all month, lies north of the 

	waxing crescent Moon and to the east of the Pleiades star cluster high in 

	the western skies after sundown.<p>

	<h4>75 Years Ago</h4>

	

					<img src="./75yrs.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>



	

	George M.  Stratton, writing in the March, 1921, issue of <i>The Atlantic 

	Monthly</i>: "For, if there is anything upon which psychologists are 

	agreed, it is that the mind is active; not indifferent, but selective, 

	forever choosing and rejecting.  Even its humblest experiences, the colors 

	and sounds by which the world is known, are not given us, but are the 

	mind's unique and mysterious response to external stimulation.  Hue and 

	tone, the students of physics and of psychology are agreed, do not exist in 

	the external world.  They are our reaction; and with them we create for 

	ourselves a strange counterpart of the reality without.  And for one object 

	awakening enough interest to be noticed, ten have vainly assailed our eyes 

	and ears and have been ignored.  These acts of notice and selection do not 

	seem acts, being without effort, without strain of will.  But action is not 

	always marked by effort: a child at play is as active as a child at some 

	deadening task." <p>

<blockquote>
	
	<font size=5>C</font>APITALISM has been coming in for some scarifying criticism lately. Since the
first of the year National Public Radio has broadcast a thoughtful series on
the causes and human costs of corporate downsizing. <i>The New York Times</i>
has run a <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/downsize/">seven-part series</A> on America under the big knife of downsizing.
<i>Newsweek</i>, on its cover, has called executives who specialize in layoffs
"Corporate Killers." Calling the stock market "un-American," Pat Buchanan has
injected the issue of "corporate butchers," disposable workers, and the
downsized American dream into Republican politics. Picking up on the ideas of
Labor Secretary Robert Reich, congressional Democrats have introduced
legislation to give tax breaks to companies that treat their employees
decently. On college campuses, meanwhile, students are signing up to be union
organizers. The new president of the AFL-CIO, John Sweeney, promises to make
downsizing an issue in collective bargaining and to expand the union's
organizing work, reaching out to janitors, hospital attendants, and
"pink-collar" workers, mostly women, who are employed in the service industries
of the information economy. An effort is even being made to organize southern
poultry workers, off whose limb-threatening labor we grow thin.<p>

"Economic insecurity," "Wall Street greed," "throw-away workers"--the air is
full of the language of radicalism. In the 1890s, as many commentators have
noted, mass movements of Americans used these very words about "the money
power." A century ago the local economies of small-town America were being
overridden by the irresistible imperatives of the first truly national economy.
Agricultural America was dying; industrial America was being born. <p>

<img src="Radical.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

The radicalism of the 1890s failed; the full protections demanded by Populists
and, later, Progressives against the community-destroying effects of the
nationalized corporate-driven economy would not come for decades. Some, notably
universal health insurance, have not yet come. It took the legitimacy crisis of
finance capitalism brought on by the great crash of 1929--the dangers of
unchecked speculation became a national catastrophe--along with the collapse of
the corporate system itself in the Depression for Americans battered by
national economic forces to get, finally, a New Deal. <p>

Must Americans battered by the even vaster and more impersonal forces of
deregulated financial markets--in part driven, cannibalistically, by employee
pension funds--and the new global economy wait as long? Must the real economy,
with its real workers and real families and real communities, yield inexorably
to every electronic burp of the financial economy? Must 80 percent of Americans
accept flat or falling wages while the top one percent continue to amass more
wealth than the bottom 90 percent? Will only one side of Henry Demarest Lloyd's
1894 classic <i>Wealth Against Commonwealth</i> have the upper hand for the
next thirty years? <p>

In a comparison of those nineties to ours, the cardinal difference is one of
vision. The Populists, and their Progressive and Socialist and New Deal
successors, had a coherent response to the national economy. We grope for a
matching response to the world economy. Yet discontent is growing. For the
first time since the New Deal, ordinary Americans are asking what the economy
is for and why they must submit to the transnational lottery of the market and
why self-rule must stop at the economy's edge. A new debate is quickening. It
is not over justice or equality. It is over something much more American--the
meaning and content of freedom.<p>

<b><font size=6>W</font>hat interests you about the Sahara?</b><p>

It is the hottest, driest, and largest of all the deserts -- our planet
in its extreme. The size of the United States, the Sahara is so dry that
cadavers are mummified and so lonely that birds land beside travelers just for
the company. Yet it has also long been inhabited. It is that interplay between
death and life in such a place that draws me there.<p>

<b>How did you travel in the Sahara?</b><p>



In the north, where there are roads, by bus and communal taxis.  Farther
into the roadless desert, by pickup and cargo trucks.  There was a lot of
breaking down, getting stuck, digging out.  In the south I traveled by bus
again, and even by pirogue and river steamer up the Niger River, near Timbuktu.
Altogether on the trip described in <i>Sahara Unveiled</i>, I traveled about
4,000 miles.<p>



<b>What hasn't been portrayed clearly about the Sahara?</b><p>



Our view of the Sahara -- camels riding across the desert -- no longer has
anything to do with the way the real Sahara is.  Most of the Sahara is made up
of gravel plains and high volcanic peaks. The central mountains, where much of
<i>Sahara Unveiled </i>takes place, rise to 11,000 feet. Only about one fifth
of the desert is sand, which forms huge seas of dunes -- some the size of all
of France.  <p>


I found it interesting that we are so far
off-base in our thinking about this  isolated part of the world, but what
became even more interesting to me was the way that this image plays into the
desert itself.  We actually affect the way the people in the Sahara see
themselves -- through our television, tourism, wealth, and political influence.
It's a rather difficult theme to pursue, but in my section on the Tuareg
rebellion -- where this has in fact led to war -- I squarely address it.  What
I'm talking about is the romanticizing of an indigenous people and the
environment in which they live.  They take this romanticism to heart.  I argue
that this leads to reactionary wars.  <p>

<b>Did <i>you </i>ever find yourself romanticizing it?</b><p>


I've thought about that question a lot, and I think the answer is no. I never
have romanticized the people of the Sahara. Why? It's very hard to romanticize
someone whom you really respect.  The desert is a romantic and emotionally
appealing place to me, but the minute you break down the barriers of distance
and stereotype and begin to treat people as equals, you find that indeed they
are our equals.  <p>

<B>For those who have visited places like Death Valley and arid portions of
the American Southwest, can they get a feeling of the terrain and climate of
the Sahara?</B> <p>


I don't think you can at all.  One thing you can get a feeling for in the
American West is the heat.  If you go to Death Valley in the summer and expose
yourself to that heat -- around 115 or 120 degrees -- for more than about five
minutes, you can feel it. You can then use your imagination to put yourself in
a place where this heat extends for hundreds, if not thousands of miles, and
where you don't have air conditioning, airlines, buses, trains or cars.<p>

Another thing is the vastness of the Sahara. There is nothing like that in the
American West. We have a huge desert, of course, but the Sahara is as big as
all of the United States including Alaska,  a state whose size we can't even
imagine.  It's so very, very big.<p>

<img src="sahara.gif" width=279 height=143 border=0 vspace=5 
hspace=10 align=left alt="The Tadart">
The final thing that is very different in the Sahara is the feeling of Africa.
That's something that I've felt twice in my travels for <i>The Atlantic</i>.
The first was in the high mountains of the central Sahara at night, standing
and looking at the stars.  I was looking to the south and thought that we all
came from somewhere way, way down there, across this horizon and underneath
these stars. It was a powerful, almost instinctive, feeling that the desert
gave me. The other place I felt that was  upriver from Khartoum on the Nile.  I
looked at the river and realized how far this water had come; I got a sense of
the depth not only of the Sahara and of Africa but of history and the human
experience in this place as well.<p>

<B>What is life like in the oases?</B><p>

Oases are not waterholes so much as ancient and fortified trading
villages and palm groves located around good wells.  In some places the
underground water lies so close to the surface that there are ordinances
against digging basements because of the threat of uncontrollable flooding.
Life in the oases is incestuous, traditional, turned in on itself, maybe a
little fearful.  It is like life in so many small towns -- only more so because
of the hostility of the surrounding land. I visited one fortified oasis in
Algeria where the city gates are locked against strangers every night.  I think
of the oases as islands in the sea.<p>


<B>You use several parables  and folk tales throughout the book. Why did you
decide to use them and where did you find them?</B><p>

<img src="camel.gif" width=135 height=193 border=0 vspace=5 
hspace=15 align=right alt="Camel">
I wanted to break up the narrative;  I wanted to shake the reader out of one
mood and into another.  I discovered these parables in  libraries, largely in
France. There's an enormous rich literature that results mostly from French
colonial explorations. In reading these parables and folk tales I found the
connections to what I was seeing and experiencing as I moved through the desert
-- and as I moved as a writer through the book. What they show is the
connection between the past and what I'm looking at in an unromantic way. You
see these strands of thought in the local thinking and ways of doing things. <p>

<B>Richard Bernstein, in his <i>New York Times </i> review of your book, says,
"<i>Sahara Unveiled </i> is worth its price for Malika and Ameur alone." In your
interactions with these two Algerians, what did you learn about relationships
between Saharan men and women?</B><p>

I have discovered -- not just in the Sahara but in my other work for <i>The
Atlantic</i> -- that it is possible to be a feminist and an Islamic radical at
the same time.  The argument used by the Islamic feminists is that the real
exploitation of women is the sexual exploitation that occurs in the West.
Having true respect for women means that you fight against this. Now, there are
big problems with this viewpoint, and I certainly don't support it. But I can
understand it in the context. It's very hard for Westerners to understand
because the context is so alien.  <p>

What I found in the case of Malika and Ameur was a rare entr&eacute;e into the
dynamics of an Algerian relationship. Ameur was a "fixer" in the Third World
sense and lived in an oasis in the Sahara. His beautiful wife Malika was not
veiled when I met her in her house, which in itself was quite an exceptional
sign of friendship on Ameur's part. Slowly -- after Ameur had a car accident
that temporarily put him in a coma -- an intimacy developed between Malika and
me. What I discovered was her very difficult and tortured existence. She was
probably more representative than any political model of what the experience of
women is really like in the Sahara, and maybe  the Islamic world, right now. <p>

Malika fell in love with Ameur in Algiers.  He was a modern man who wanted to
make a good life for himself and saw an opportunity in the Sahara. He moved
away and she went with him. Then something happened: the Sahara surrounded
them.  Ameur began to close himself off and  eventually he came to mistrust and
despise Malika. He kept her pregnant, insisted that she veil herself, and even
beat her. He treated her very badly, and in the end he left her with nothing.
It's a difficult story.<p>


<img src="well.gif" width=176 height=129 border=0 vspace=5 
hspace=15 align=left alt="Well">

<B>The importance of water and the inescapable experience of thirst pervade
<i>Sahara Unveiled. </i>Has your appreciation for water changed?</B><p>

It did right away.  Water is life. Now when it rains, I often turn my face up
and open my mouth to let the raindrops fall in.  Rain is the gift of nature.
It's an amazing phenomenon that this <i>life </i>falls from the sky. <p>

<B>What does the average Saharan's diet consist of?</B><p>

Since there are very poor people in the Sahara who eat very little,  it's
difficult to know what to say about diet in an average sense.  However if you
take the core of the Sahara and talk about what people would like to eat if
they could eat anything they want, their diets would consist largely of
couscous, rice, and palm dates.  Saharans are crazy about dates, and as a
result they have very bad teeth. Aside from that Saharans eat a range of foods
-- from vegetables to dairy products to meat. There's also great bread that's
cooked in the sand. After traveling all day in the desert you build a small
fire and put the dough under the sand, and after several hours out comes a
brick of unleavened bread. It's very good. <p>


<B>The third section of <i>Sahara Unveiled</i>,  "The Edge Is A Desert Too,"
describes the populations you encountered in the cities and on the river boats
in Niger, Mali, and Senegal. What do you see as some of the parallels between
the Sahara and sub-Saharan Africa?</B><p>

I think there are many forms of desert. There is the strictly meteorological
desert -- less than three inches of rainfall a year -- and there is the
functional desert, where there is simply not enough rain for agriculture,
vegetables, or goats. Finally, some say the desert is a place where people
simply don't have enough. You can carry it as far as you want.  I think that to
be realistic you have to define the southern edge of the desert, the grassland,
the Sahel, and the savanna as being essentially part of the desert.  In the
beginning of the third section, I wrote, "The Sahel is a band of dry grassland,
a savanna with no independent identity, the Sahara's southern shore. The
Africans who inhabit it are a desert people. They do not contemplate the
tropics to their south, but face instead toward the barren north from which
every few years the Sahara surges across them." The focus is very much on the
desert even if the land is not itself technically the desert. <p>

<B>How has your understanding of Islam changed from your time spent in the
Sahara?</B><p>

That's difficult for me to answer because I've spent so much time in the Sahara
now. I don't even know what my feeling about Islam was before I went there. I
would assume that I was a standard American, with a relatively open mind toward
all different ideologies, but with a sense that Islam had dragged down a large
number of people across history through its insistence on conservative
interpretations of the past. This is probably true, but since my time in the
Sahara my feelings toward Islam have softened and become more complex.  I now
recognize another powerful and positive side to Islam -- the ideology of
equality.  Islam has a strong egalitarian quality that is very appealing.<p>

<B>Can you think of an instance where this positive nature comes
through?</B><p>

It comes through all the time. It comes through in the way people treat the
poor in the streets. It comes through in race relations,  for instance in the
acceptance of black Africans in the middle of the Saharan culture. It is quite
different from our race relations.  Christianity is also very accepting, but I
would say that most people in the Sahara have not strayed as far from their
religion and ideology as we have from ours. That may be the real difference.
I'm not an apologist for the excess,  but I want to recognize the full range of
Islam.  <p>

<B>Do you have a desire to return to the Sahara?</B> <p>

I don't want take any trips that I've taken before. But I would love to see my
friends in the Sahara, and  I would love to take my children.  It's a wonderful
part of the world but it's simply not a safe place now. There are safe and
easily accessible parts of the Sahara -- I've spent a lot of time in both
Morocco and Tunisia -- but they're not my favorite. Their accessibility has
distorted the experience of the Sahara. There are a lot of resort hotels that
Europeans appear at in the tens of thousands wearing Bedouin outfits from Saudi
Arabia.  I tried to write about it but it became uninteresting.<p>

<B>Can you envision the Sahara in a hundred years? How about in a
thousand?</B><p>

<img src="rockart3.gif" width=226 height=144 border=0 vspace=5 
hspace=15 align=right alt="Rock Art">

The basic fact of the Sahara is that there is no water. I do not think that is
going to change -- at least not in a hundred years.  The hyper-arid core, where
there is not only no vegetation but no bacteria, is expanding.  Because of
this, it seems likely that the Sahara will stay pretty much the way it is.  A
thousand years from now it's hard to say. The Sahara has gone through many
cycles of dryness and wetness and at times has even been forested with  lakes
and rivers.  On the southern edge people are now affecting that cycle, through
overgrazing and deforestation. <p>

Culturally of course it will change, just as the whole world will change.
There's nothing to regret about that. Just as we embrace change in our own
society and welcome it as healthy, we need to be very careful not to treat
other cultures as museum pieces. <p>

<B>What other areas of the world intrigue you?</B><p>

The entire world fascinates me.  I also think the entire world is
underreported. The United States and Europe,  especially since the demise of
the Soviet Union,  have been laboring under a set of illusions that are
distorting our world view. My job, as I see it, is to break through those
illusions and allow people to see clearly. I think this can be applied with
great interest almost anywhere. I have a feeling that when I finish my current
project, which is a book on aviation, I will be heading for Central Asia and
the Himalayas.<p>

	<font size=5>I</font>n Latin America, where Rub&eacute;n Dar&iacute;o, Gabriela Mistral, Miguel

Angel Asturias, Pablo Neruda, Octavio Paz, Alejo Carpentier, and Carlos Fuentes

have served as diplomats, and where the poet Ernesto Cardenal was the

Nicaraguan Minister of Culture under the Sandinistas, a compelling metaphor is

not always the limit of a writer's power. In 1990 Mario Vargas Llosa, the only

contemporary Peruvian with an international literary reputation, ran for

President of his country. He garnered a plurality of 29 percent in the first

round of balloting but lost the runoff to an obscure agronomist named Alberto

Fujimori, who received 57 percent of the final vote. In <i>A Fish in the

Water</i>, the memoir that Vargas Llosa published in Spanish in 1993, he

recalled the arguments with which Paz tried to dissuade him from entering

politics: "incompatibility with intellectual work, loss of independence, being

manipulated by professional politicians, and, in the long run, frustration and

the feeling of years of one's life wasted." Nevertheless "the decadence, the

impoverishment, the terrorism, and the multiple crises of Peruvian society," as

Vargas Llosa explained it, drew him to the challenge of seeking "the most

dangerous job in the world." The author of ten novels, including <i>The Green

House</i> (1968), <i>Conversation in The Cathedral </i>(1975), <i>Aunt Julia

and the Scriptwriter </i> (1982), <i>The War of the End of the World </i> (1984),

and <i>In Praise of the Stepmother </i> (1990), by running for President of his

poor, embattled nation, pursued the grandiose illusion "of writing the great

novel in real life." <p>



Living now in London, Vargas Llosa is again trying to write the great novel

through more conventional means. At the age of fifty he outlined a five-year

plan for fresh projects that would include "a novel, something between a

detective story and a fictional fantasy, about cataclysms, human sacrifices,

and political crimes in a village in the Andes." <i>Death in the Andes </i> is

that novel. Originally published in 1993 in Barcelona, as <i>Lituma en los

Andes </i>, the new book is Vargas Llosa's first work of fiction since his

political adventure. It is the work of a man who, even in exile from the nation

that repudiated him and in retirement from the public life he grew to despise,

is as obsessed with his native land as was James Joyce, who physically

abandoned Ireland but wrote about nothing else. "It's a country nobody can

understand," says Paul Stormsson, a Danish professor in the new novel, trying

to explain his prolonged fascination with Peru. "And for people from clear,

transparent countries like mine, nothing is more attractive than an

indecipherable mystery." <p> 



<font size=5>D</font><i>EATH in the Andes </i> begins with a mystery: What happened to three

men--a mute, an albino, and a construction foreman--who suddenly vanished from

Naccos, a remote mining town in the Peruvian Andes? It concludes with an

enigma: How slender is the boundary between civilization and tenebrous horror?

The novel's indecipherable mystery is exquisitely attractive to the clear,

transparent country that is a genial reader's mind. <p>



The protagonist, Lituma, is a native of Piura, in the northern coastal plain;

to him, alpine Naccos is a madhouse where he is the only sane inmate. A

corporal in the Civil Guard, posted to Naccos--with only one subordinate--to

protect 200 workers who are trying to build a highway, Lituma is determined to

solve the disappearances. Were the missing men victims of Sendero Luminoso, or

Shining Path--guerrillas who are ruthlessly bent on eradicating all traces of

urban industrial capitalism? Or has some atavistic savagery surfaced, a

reversion to the ritual sacrifices and cannibalism practiced by the region's

early Chanca and Huanca cultures? In Lituma, Vargas Llosa (who spent some of

his childhood in Piura, which, he recalls fondly in <i>A Fish in the Water</i>,

"is more immediately real in what I have written than anywhere else in the

world") offers a surrogate for himself and for the civilized reader. Through

the exasperated corporal we confront a murky, mountainous universe unamenable

to the rule of reason. In founding and leading Libertad, a civic movement

designed to cleanse Peruvian politics of its venality and violence, Vargas

Llosa presented himself as a champion of enlightenment in a sad, benighted

land. He explains in his memoir:

"Although I was born in <A HREF="http://www.odci.gov.cia/publications/95fact/pe.html">Peru</A> ("through an accident of geography," as the head of

the Peruvian Army, General Nicol&aacute;s de Bari Hermoza, put it, thinking

that he was insulting me), my vocation is that of a cosmopolitan and an

expatriate who has always detested nationalism, which strikes me as one of the

human aberrations that has made the most blood flow."

<p>

In

Vargas Llosa's account of his campaign for the presidency, the bloody, aberrant

forces of fear, resentment, and obscurantism triumphed over urbane reason.

<i>Death in the Andes</i> re-enacts that national and personal failure. The decent

corporal, who represents authority, is isolated and helpless in Naccos.<p>



The novel offers vivid demonstrations of why Peru, which the nineteenth-century

naturalist Antonio Raimondi called "a beggar sitting on a bench made of gold,"

has become an international symbol of self-destruction. Like the Cambodian

Khmer Rouge, Sendero Luminoso--before President Fujimori displayed its

legendary leader, Abimael Guzm&aacute;n, captive in a cage--was world-renowned

for savagery in the service of ideological zeal. In <i>Death in the Andes

</i>terrorists stone to death two young French tourists who gaze in awe at the

Peruvian landscape and whose only crime is ignorance of Spanish. They also

execute Hortensia D'Harcourt, an elderly naturalist who naively believes that

someone whose life has been spent studying and protecting the country's

environmental and cultural resources will be spared by fanatics. "Our concern

is nature, the environment, the animals and plants," she informs her accusers.

"We don't work for the government; we work for Peru. All of Peru." But,

categorizing her as "the intellectual who serves bourgeois power and the ruling

class," the terrorists are deaf to her appeals to common ideals or common

humanity. When they murder her, they are as impassive as when they slaughter a

herd of vicu&ntilde;as.<p>



However, <i>Death in the Andes</i> offers horrors even more harrowing than

Shining Path. The <i>serruchos</i>--mountain people--believe that their rugged

terrain is haunted by <i>apus</i>, tutelary spirits of the local summits who

must periodically be propitiated with ritual slaughter and cannibalism.

<i>Pishtacos</i>, demons who suck the fat out of living human bodies, are said

to wander the mountainside. "In civilized places, nobody believes things like

that anymore," Lituma says. But the corporal is not in Piura anymore, and many

in Naccos believe that the <i>huayco</i>, the Andean avalanche that defeats the

efforts to build a highway and nearly kills Lituma, has supernatural origins.

Lituma interrogates Dionisio, the proprietor of the town's only cantina and the

impresario of nightly Dionysian revelries. But neither he nor his wife,

Adriana, a devotee of witchcraft, can satisfy a civilized man seeking a lucid

explanation for the mysterious disappearances in Naccos. <p>



Neither can the lonely corporal find sexual satisfaction. Lituma's only

companion is his adjutant, Tom&aacute;s Carre&ntilde;o, a young Civil Guardsman

assigned to this forlorn post as penance for a violent infraction. Every night,

as they prepare for sleep on their Spartan cots, Tom&aacute;s recounts an

installment of his own love story, and Vargas Llosa's text cuts deftly from the

bleak stint in Naccos to a droll romantic fantasy of passion, murder, courage,

and devotion. An Andean Scheherazade, Tom&aacute;s keeps his listener awake

long into the night with a tale that arouses Lituma's curiosity and his

frustrated lust. Assigned to serve as a bodyguard to a gangster called Hog,

Tom&aacute;s killed Hog after he observed him bedding and beating a pretty

prostitute. A twenty-three-year-old virgin, Tom&aacute;s fell desperately in

love with the prostitute, Mercedes Trelles, who was indifferent and even

hostile to her presumed benefactor. In fact by murdering Hog, Tom&aacute;s

endangered them both. (The vanity of benefaction is something the lovestruck

young bodyguard shares with his quixotic politician-author.) Tom&aacute;s and

Mercedes flee across Peru, and amid a series of outlandish escapades

Tom&aacute;s loses his virginity and $4,000. When, at the end of the novel, the

beautiful Mercedes materializes in Naccos, Vargas Llosa confounds two realms,

along with the skeptical reader who would not credit the power of love.<p>



	<font size=5>I</font>N  the Andean fastness of Vargas Llosa's new book passion is as indecipherable

a mystery as violence. Both defy and defeat the logical mind. One intoxicating

evening Lituma listens to a couple of mining engineers tell chilling stories

about the pre-Columbian peoples who inhabited Peru: "Sacrificing children, men,

women to the river they were going to divert, the road they were going to open,

the temple or fortress they were building--that's not what we call civilized."

Corporal Lituma is a civilized man who has strayed into the heart of darkness,

and the hypothesis of atavism seems the only rational response to the

horror--the horror of humanity. "Two cultures, one Western and modern, the

other aboriginal and archaic, badly coexist, separated from each other because

of the exploitation and discrimination that the former exercises over the

latter," Vargas Llosa wrote about <i>The Green House</i>. But he might just as

well have been describing the figure in the carpet of his entire career,

including his failed presidential bid. <p>



Lituma meets a mining engineer who wonders "if what's going on in Peru isn't a

resurrection of all that buried violence. As if it had been hidden somewhere,

and suddenly, for some reason, it all surfaced again." The traumas of a

political campaign marked by irrationality, violence, and disappointment

surface again in <i>Death in the Andes</i>. A vocal critic of President

Fujimori, who subdued the terrorists but also arrogated to himself

extra-constitutional powers, Vargas Llosa apparently considers it imprudent to

return to Peru. Yet even after spurning him at the polls, Peruvians remain

proud of their most famous novelist. A visitor to Lima is often taken to the

affluent suburb of Barranco to gaze at the house that Vargas Llosa left behind.

In <i>Death in the Andes</i> the author returns to his most successful medium,

in an account of cosmic failure that explains why he abandoned politics but

cannot leave home. <p>



In a lecture on his own fiction, delivered at Syracuse University in 1988,

Vargas Llosa identified <i>The War of the End of the World</i> as his favorite,

"because I think it is the most ambitious project I have ever undertaken." At a

mere 271 pages, <i>Death in the Andes</i> lacks the heft of that 568-page tome,

a complex account of a mid-1890s rebellion in the Bahia region of Brazil. But

it is the author's most immediately and thoroughly engaging book since <i>Aunt

Julia and the Scriptwriter</i>. In his five-year plan for literary production

Vargas Llosa outlined ideas for other Peruvian fictions: "a play about a little

old Quixote-like man who, in the Lima of the 1950s, embarks on a crusade to

save the city's colonial-era balconies threatened with demolition" and "a

historical novel inspired by Flora Tristan, the Franco-Peruvian revolutionary,

ideologist, and feminist, who lived in the first third of the nineteenth

century." "<i>I dont hate it! I dont hate it! </i>" Faulkner's Quentin Compson,

in remote Massachusetts, insists about his native South. A ghostly exercise in

personal exorcism, <i>Death in the Andes</i> enables its exiled author to

return to his natural calling and to the native landscapes of a fertile

imagination.

<blockquote>
	
	<font size=5>O</font>NE morning a few years ago an envelope arrived from my
parents containing the bill from New Rochelle Hospital for my delivery, in
1952. The contents of a basement or attic were being culled, and the bill had
turned up in one of the many cardboard reliquaries that have long lent a kind
of ballast to my childhood home. The hospital's total charge for a five-day
stay, including drugs and phone calls, came to $187.86. I was amazed at the
cost, to be sure. But I was also struck by something else: that among all those
decades' worth of family documents my parents had looked through, the delivery
bill was the only thing they thought of sufficient interest to pass along. 
<p>
This episode came to mind last fall when the U.S. National Archives and Records
Administration announced its decision about whether, in addition to the vast
numbers of government documents that it was already required to store, it would
keep copies, paper or electronic, of all the government's E-mail. The decision
came after years of debate among historians, public-interest groups, and
government officials over a question that individual American households also
ask themselves: How much stuff is worth saving? Opponents of E-mail storage
argued that it would preserve at great expense a lot of useless clutter.
Proponents noted that these days E-mail is sometimes the only "paper" trail
that survives, and pointed to the role it played in the case of Oliver North
and the Iran-contra arms-for-hostages deal. <p>

Last fall the proponents won: the government's E-mail is now being saved.<p>
<center>
* * *<p>
</center>
At some point most of us realize that having a personal archival strategy is an
inescapable aspect of modern life: one has to draw the line somewhere. What
should the policy be toward children's drawings and report cards? Toward
personal letters and canceled checks? Toward family photographs and wedding
mementos? Toward favorite but no longer usable articles of clothing? People
work out ad hoc answers to such questions, usually erring, I suspect, on the
side of over-accrual. My father, who is an artist, still has all his art-school
sketchbooks from when he was in his early teens, and he has some 10,000
Polaroid photographs of himself that he took over the years in order to capture
details of lighting and drapery. He has a file of newspaper clippings about
Fordham football games from the 1930s. Almost everyone seems to save--or
"curate," as archaeologists say--issues of <i>National Geographic</i>. That is
why in garbage landfills copies of that magazine are rarely found in isolation;
rather, they are found in herds, when an entire collection has been discarded
after an owner has died or moved.<p>

	<img src="./Note.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>	
	I happen to be an admirer of the archiving impulse and an inveterate archivist
at the household level. Though not quite one of those people whom public-health
authorities seem to run across every few years, with a house in which neatly
bundled stacks of newspaper occupy all but narrow aisles, I do tend to save
almost everything that is personal and familial, and even to supplement this
private hoard with oddities of a more public nature--a calling card of Thomas
Nast's, for instance, and a baseball bat of Luis Aparicio's, and Kim Philby's
copy of <i>The Joy of Cooking</i>. <p>

I cannot help wondering, though, whether as a nation we are compiling archives
at a rate that will exceed anyone's ability ever to make sense of them. A
number of observers have cited the problem of "information overload" as if it
were a recent development, largely the consequence of computers. In truth, the
archive backlog has been a problem for millennia. The excavation of thousands
of cuneiform tablets in the ancient archives of Ebla, in what is now Syria, was
hugely important, but it will be many decades before the tablets are fully
translated, and by then further discoveries will no doubt have dug scholars
more deeply, as it were, into a hole. A few years ago a Vatican official spent
a morning taking me through the rich labyrinths and frescoed recesses of the
Vatican Library. "Do you even know what you have?" I asked at one point. He
shrugged, and said that although the name of every item probably existed in the
records somewhere--"Here, like this," he said, pulling out an
eighteenth-century ledger and pointing to an entry in an elegant hand--he
guessed that no one had actually opened up and looked at two thirds of the
collection. <p>

Writing's great advantage over memory has ever been that it allows one to
"remember" what one can then forget about--an invitation to warehousing. The
process keeps speeding up, and Roy Williams, a researcher at the California
Institute of Technology's Center for Advanced Computing Research, has attempted
to calculate how fast. He notes that the amount of information now stored in
all printed sources everywhere in the world is roughly equivalent to 200
"petabytes," a petabyte being a quadrillion bytes. In contrast, Williams has
calculated,  the amount of information that will have accumulated in online
media alone by the year 2000--that is, in the course of a mere couple of
decades--is expected to be two and a half times as much as that, and he
concedes that this figure may be a gross underestimation. <p>
<center>
* * *<p>
</center>

Historians obviously have problems when information is scarce, but it's not
hard to see a very different problem emerging as source material becomes
spectacularly overabundant. The great historian R. G. Collingwood addressed
this issue in 1926 in his <i>Lectures on the Philosophy of History</i>,
pointing out why historians at the time approached ancient Greece differently
from ancient Rome. For example, he wrote,

Greek history in the fifth century B.C. is a valuable study for the beginner in
historical work because there are so few sources for it that the beginner can
grasp them as a whole, and proceed to the work of interpreting them for
himself. . . . When, on the other hand, he deals with Roman history of the
early Empire, he is embarrassed by the immense mass of the available sources,
especially those derived from epigraphy; here, therefore, he is confronted with
the opposite problem, the problem of acquiring a sound scholarship or
acquaintance with the sources, and the work of interpreting them falls
comparatively into the background.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
Imagine how much more daunting the work of interpretation becomes with the
development of modern national bureaucracies and the national archives they
have supplied. The historian Derek Beales, writing recently about the immense
task facing any chronicler of the nearly sixty-eight-year reign of the Emperor
Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary, observed, "What remains of the remorseless
bureaucratic record is far too large for any one person to master." Leave aside
the task of assessing an entire epoch and consider what is required in purely
physical terms to preserve even a single prominent person's lifetime
documentary output. Benjamin Disraeli's correspondence survives down to the
level of what today would be an E-mail message: "My darling, I shall be home
for dinner at 1/2 pt 7. In haste, Your, Dis." Woodrow Wilson left so much
behind that the historian Arthur S. Link spent his entire career at Princeton
University annotating and publishing Wilson's personal papers, in sixty-nine
volumes. <p>

The National Archives in Washington now has about five billion documents in
storage. Nationwide, federal repositories have another 19 million cubic feet of
them, which in boxes set end to end would stretch from coast to coast. (Thirty
years ago the boxes would have reached only from Washington to Wichita.) There
are thousands of other data hoards, public and private, all around the country.
Electronic storage, despite its incomparable vastness, may eventually make
finding some specific things easier, if one knows what one is looking for, and
the Library of Congress and the National Archives have ambitious projects under
way. But electronic storage also has some major drawbacks, such as the fact
that deterioration and technological obsolescence will require that all
electronic data be copied onto new systems every ten years. In any event, the
cadre of people available to look into all this material is not getting much
larger. The number of professors of American history, for instance, has been
relatively constant for years. (There are currently about 6,000.) <p>

Is it preposterous to begin thinking of some of our archives as the new tels?
Tels are the mounds that layer upon layer of former cities make; they are
everywhere in the Middle East, harboring the archaeological record of thousands
of years of human history. But there are too many of them for more than a few
ever to be excavated systematically, and understanding what's in even those few
takes decades if not centuries. For the rest, the occasional exploratory shaft
or trench must suffice. I thought of those shafts and trenches recently when a
historian friend mentioned that some of his colleagues, confronted with too
great a bulk of sources, resign themselves to "sampling," and others
increasingly narrow the focus of their academic inquiries until they find
something manageable.<p>

Don't get me wrong: I am not proposing that we discard anything at all. One
rarely knows in advance what will turn out to be of interest or importance and
what should have gone directly into the oubliette. It is always delightful when
something is discovered unexpectedly, as the biblical city Urkesh of the
Horites was just a few months ago (inside a tel). But information does have its
natural predators, and it may be that sometimes natural processes work out for
the best. <p>

A professor of mine once said that the only thing enabling him to complete his
study of medieval France was that so many of the records he would otherwise
have had to look at were destroyed during the Wars of Religion and the French
Revolution. I called him up recently to ask if I remembered his remark
correctly. He said yes, I did. And he recalled with particular gratitude a
certain bonfire in Carcassonne.<p>

	<font size=5>I</font>n 1969, Kevin Phillips sagely analyzed the backlash against permissiveness,

the breaking of the shackles tying southerners to the Democratic Party, and the

result of these two developments an "emerging Republican majority," which has

dominated national politics for more than twenty years. In his new book he

espies the rise of a new populist spirit in the land in the "Reagan aftermath."

He offers a high-velocity account of the "math"--the politics and policies that

made greed a 1980s art form--but little on the shape or texture of the

"after."<p>



<p>



Phillips identifies the Reagan years as the nation's third period of "heyday

capitalism," following the Gilded Age and the Roaring Twenties. He finds a

score of parallels between those periods and the decade just past. As reformist

movements followed those earlier eras of excess, so, he believes, the nineties

may see a new populist spirit.<p>



<p>



But the political logic underlying what Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., has called

"the cycles of American history," the alternations of periods of reaction with

periods of reform, has lost its old social and cultural bases. Anyone waiting

for a new populist revolt in contemporary America is kidding himself. The

forces in the popular culture which tend to dampen our resentment of

accumulations of wealth are probably stronger now than at any time in our

history. We are wedded to the life-styles of the rich and famous. We may

despise Leona Helmsley today and Donald Trump tomorrow, but we remain a society

transfixed by celebrity. Earlier generations loved to hate Jay Gould and Samuel

Insull, but it would have been substantially harder to abhor them had they been

humanized on the covers of People magazine. Once upon a time men got rich by

developing a product or a service that someone wanted to buy. Now, more than

ever before, wealth itself is a product, used to enhance stature and

profitability. Lee Iacocca is famous not for rescuing Chrysler but for being

Lee Iacocca, and because he's famous maybe we'll buy his car. High-style

fashions may be sold to the rich and famous, but the marketing of high-style

fashion is now aimed at us. Hardly a month passes that a new magazine does not

hit the racks whose dominant content is fashion advertising. Smart, L.A. Style,

Egg, Details, Interview. Pick your perfume. Can Trump be far behind? We pay

money to see what the rich pay money to buy. How can we resent them for buying

what we ourselves pay just to look at?<p>



<p>



If Phillips were right and there were latent resentment over the increasing

accumulations and concentrations of wealth--which are largely the result not of

nature but of government policy, as Phillips amply demonstrates--how would the

word get out, and how would we organize to take the collective action necessary

to reverse the tide? Our politicians and the television news are themselves

largely in the thrall of the very forces of glitz that such a reformist

insurgency would undermine. American politics is a form of entertainment in

which a good line--"Read my lips"--is about all we can recall from a

presidential campaign. It is not that we just don't remember those thoughtful

speeches that George Bush and Michael Dukakis made in 1988 about

Soviet-American relations in the age of Gorbachev; they never made them. Raised

on Sesame Street and now MTV--a celebration of commercials between rock videos

that are themselves merely commercials for celebrities--we demand production

values, not social values, in our politics. Kiku Adatto, a fellow at the

Shorenstein Barone Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy, at Harvard

University, reported in The New York Times that from 1968 to 1988 the average

sound bite in television newscasts fell from 42.3 seconds to 9.8 seconds.

Docudramas and re-creations make better politics than politics itself. For the

President to declare war on drugs is not enough, his advisers decide. We need a

drug buy in Lafayette Park the night before to give the President a dramatic

prop and his speech sufficient entertainment value to grab our attention.

Charts on changing income distribution? Boring!<p>



<p>



More troubling yet, even if we had the information on which to act, we lack the

means to take reasoned collective political action. The national political

parties, which once had the ability to formulate comprehensive, coherent

agendas and to bind their candidates to them, are moribund; the Democrats, who

presumably would spur a reformist move, have passed beyond death to ashes.

Candidates themselves run as celebrity free-lancers. It may be that no

incumbent is a hero to his valet, but most--judging by the success rate of

incumbents--are beloved by their constituents. Many, like Hollywood stars,

beckon us into their personal lives and encourage us to "share" their personal

struggles. Prurience, not politics, seems the art of the possible.<p>



<p>



As political structures have collapsed, social institutions that might provide

forums for the development of collective political action--or at least the

building of political wisdom--have faltered and lost credibility. The Catholic

Church cannot sell its message on abortion, let alone on the necessity for

social action, to its members; unions, struggling to survive, have all but

abandoned political activity More and more, we practice our politics alone.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



It was not always thus. Lawrence Goodwyn, a historian of the Populist movement,

describes a meeting, in Winfield, Kansas, on July 4, 1890.<p>



<p>



"The farmers had assembled in their wagons at their suballiances [chapters] and

the trains of wagons from different suballiances merged at the county line

enroute to Winfield. As they neared the city, these trains fell in with similar

ones from other county alliances. The caravan entering Cowley County from one

direction alone stretched for miles. One can well imagine what this spectacle

must have brought home to the participants. The Alliance was the people. And

the people were together."<p>



<p>



We have come a long way in a hundred years.<p>



<p>



More and more, the dwindling numbers of us that bother to vote leave our

political decisions to an elite--an elite that is itself a beneficiary of

trickle-up politics, that leans on the super-rich to finance its campaigns, and

that yearns for the support of celebrities to give its activities some

visibility. We get most of our political news alone, staring at the tube after

dinner or before we go to bed. Much of what we hear or see from our political

leaders, appearing at staged events and speaking in sound bites neatly crafted

by consultants, is a playback of what we ourselves told them as we sat alone

just nights earlier talking on the phone to a researcher for a public opinion

pollster. (As others have noted, such surveys might better be called

private-opinion polls.) Even those of us who take an "active" interest in

politics most often do so by sending our $70 annual membership fee to a

national organization that rarely, if ever, holds membership meetings and whose

policies are crafted and compromised by an elite in state capitals or in

Washington.<p>



<p>



Many in that elite were, of course, beneficiaries of the upward redistribution

of wealth and income in the 1980s. Phillips writes:<p>



<p>



"As the decade closed, the distortion of American wealth raised questions not

just about polarization but also about trivialization. Less and less of the

nation's wealth was going to people who produced manufactures or commodities.

Services were ascendant....The concentration of wealth in the services

industries, however, raised another problem. It was one thing for new

technologies to reduce demand for farmers, steelworkers and typists, enabling

society to concentrate more resources on health, money management and leisure.

But the distortion lay in the disproportionate rewards to society's economic,

legal and cultural manipulators--from lawyers and investment advisers to

advertising executives, merchandisers, consumer finance specialists, fashion

designers, communicators, media magnates and entertainment promoters."<p>



<p>



It is hardly surprising that such people went along with the Reaganesque

policies, detailed by Phillips, that enhanced their advantages and widened the

income gulf in the land: whopping tax cuts for the rich, increasing Social

Security taxes that fell heavily on middle-class America, rising defense

spending that benefited certain segments of the economy and sections of the

country, high real rates of interest that accrued to those who held debt,

deregulation that proved a boon to certain industries, and decreased social

spending that cut the buying power of the poor. Millions of jobs may have been

created, but they were by and large at the lower end of the service economy.

Billions of dollars were invested, but not so much in economically productive

enterprises as in the gigantic crap shoot known as leveraged buyouts. And when

it was all over, America found itself a debtor nation, many of whose most

important assets were in the hands of the Japanese.<p>



<p>



"Accumulation and concentration [of wealth] would be the simultaneous hallmarks

of the Nineteen Eighties," Phillips writes, and he provides--in a collection of

effective charts and tables--reams of data to buttress his case. The top half

of one percent of U.S. households controls more than a quarter of the nation's

wealth. During the Reagan era the income share taken by the top 20 percent of

the nation's households increased from 41.6 percent to 44 percent, the highest

percentage since the Census Bureau began keeping the statistics, and the top

one percent got most of it. Phillips cites one study concluding that from 1977

to 1987 the average income of the top one percent of families rose from

$174,498 to $303,900. Millionaires, at least as measured by assets, were a

commonplace. And President Reagan, given his tilt toward states' rights, was

doubtless pleased to find at the end of his tenure that if the geographic

spread had worked out, each state and Washington, D.C., could have had its own

resident billionaire. These fifty-one billionaires were at the vanguard of the

"plutographics" revolution of the 1980s. At the other end of the spectrum, many

of the very poor got poorer, as the income supports they needed to subsist were

cut. More and more minority members found themselves living in poverty. America

may have been back, but 20 percent of its children didn't get the word; they

resided in households officially designated impoverished. As to how those in

the middle fared during the Reagan presidency, the data are mixed; depending on

the precise measurement used, there's a set of statistics for everyone. Yet

there can be no doubt that the households whose incomes place them in the

middle of our economic order saw, at best, only marginal gains during the

Reagan era and nothing approaching the glory days of their better-off

countrymen. The situation of this group was well articulated by Frank Levy, a

public-policy analyst quoted by Phillips:<p>



<p>



"We knew that something was wrong....It was an inequality of prospects in which

many people who had attained the middle-class dream could ride out the period

while people who aspired to the dream--people who were banking on rising living

standards--saw the future shrink."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



So the nineties are finally here, and the average American, mad as hell, isn't

going to take it any more, right? Well, not so you could tell. Phillips himself

acknowledges that there is scant evidence that his populist revolt is brewing.

So far, widespread resentment over growing inequality is--a kinder, gentler

word--"unfocused." Nor does he suggest in any concrete way what, exactly, we

should be expecting. Goodwyn, the historian of the Populist movement, has

written that "in its twentieth-century usage, the word 'Populism' has come to

imply--simply and inaccurately--a mass popular movement unencumbered by serious

intellectual content." Phillips's book will not cause Goodwyn to rethink that

definition.<p>



<p>



But the data on economic maldistribution that Phillips assembles so adroitly,

his discussion of the Reagan-era soak-the-poor policies and our quiescence in

the face of them, give us reason to reexamine our political institutions and

the social structures that ought to give life to them. Already, invidious

comparisons between our malaise and the political vibrancy of Eastern Europe

are becoming tiring. We are nodding off to avoid making a clear-eyed assessment

of our reality.<p>



<p>



As a nation, we have lost the capacity to ponder events, reflect on their

meaning, and act. Half of us may show up and vote, but we barely know what

we're voting for. We have almost no experience in the richest form of popular

governance--deliberative democracy. It is from such collective deliberation,

formal and informal, in the temples of power and the taverns of the common

people, that the wisest democratic decisions emerge. But that very word

"tavern" conjures an idea of community that is alien to most of us. As the

sociologist Ray Oldenburg writes in his recent lament for vanishing public

spaces, The Great Good Place, our taverns have lost their former "democratic

potential." Now the monoculture of the national media reaches into every tavern

and bar, the ubiquitous wide-screen TV muffling discussion with its noise.

According to Lawrence Goodwyn, the 1890s Populists had to develop a culture

apart from the monoculture of the cities to preserve their fragile solidarity

and to steel their indignant political perceptions against derision. But the

difficulties of sustaining a culture apart from, and to a certain extent

against, the environment of TV are all but insuperable today, when nothing is

safe from derision.<p>



<p>



The ostentatious accumulation of riches in the 1980s, the growing poverty and

human suffering, cry out for our attention. In some subliminal fashion our

government may get that message, and the pendulum swing that Phillips projects

may occur. Already the overheated calls for the dismantling of the welfare

state--a commonplace five years ago--have abated. A representative of old

money, George Bush has given us the noblesse if not the oblige. But the

celebration of privilege seems as firmly rooted in our culture as ever, our

capacity to nurture a collective spirit is negligible, and our ability to

generate something even vaguely in the tradition of the Populist movement seems

poignantly distant.<p>



<p>



Thus, the last, sad word to historian Goodwyn:<p>



<p>



"Older aspirations--dreams of achieving a civic culture grounded in generous

social relations and in a celebration of the vitality of human cooperation and

the diversity of human aspiration itself--have come to seem so out of

place...that the mere recitation of such longings, however authentic they have

always been, now constitutes a social embarrassment."

<blockquote>

	

	<font size=5>R</font>ECENTLY I went around a small western city looking at used cars for sale. I

needed a four-wheel-drive vehicle with room enough to sleep in. When I told the

sellers this, they always said, "Yeah, I've slept in this," or "I've spent many

a night in this." Then they would open up the back of the vehicle and we would

stand with our hands in our pockets and contemplate its interior space--the

fold-down seats, the carpet on the wheel wells--in companionable silence.

Sometimes we would talk about what various cars are like to sleep in--about the

relative comfort of a Chevy Blazer, say, where you can stretch out in the back,

versus a Ford Bronco, where you have to lie diagonally. All the sellers were

male and over twenty-one years old. In my experience, anyone in that category

out west has spent a certain amount of time living in a car.<p>



<IMG SRC="./PerFile.GIF" ALT=" " ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="151" BORDER="0" hspace=10 vspace=10>



For me, the first time was in a blue Chevy van. The year I turned thirty,

something came over me and I left my apartment in New York City and flew to

northern Michigan and walked and hitchhiked to a small town and bought a used

van and paid a local mechanic who said he specialized in van conversions to put

a bed and a fold-down desk in it. The pattern he chose for the back-window

curtains exactly duplicated the tread mark of a heavy-duty tire. I lived in the

van at a public campground for nine weeks or so, in the spring and early

summer. During the days I read the middle volumes of <i>Remembrance of Things

Past</i> on a hill above my campsite, and in the evenings I fished a nearby

trout stream. One evening on the stream I met a good fisherman named Neal, and

after we had talked a while, he asked where I lived. I told him I lived in my

van. "It's tough living out of your vehicle," he said, flicking his Marlboro

butt into the current. Until then I hadn't considered whether living in a van

was difficult or easy or anything at all. At night when I got up to go to the

bathroom, I would turn on the overhead light dangling from its two wires, put

on my shoes, climb over the front seat, open the driver's-side door, climb out,

and close it with a sound that was singular and lonesome in the stillness.

Sunrise in midsummer at that latitude was at about six o'clock, and as soon as

the light hit the van's metal it started to tick, and the air inside got

stuffy, and the sleeping flies awoke and headed for my nostrils. I would climb

out unwillingly at six-fifteen with nothing to do but sit at the picnic table

and yawn: a tough way to live, as I now saw.<p>



I owned the van for four years and drove it all over the country--to both

coasts, and to Canada and southern Texas. I had a real place to live, a house

or an apartment, during that time, but the van was my second address. Living in

it on the road was different from living in it at a campsite. At a campsite you

get used to your surroundings over time, but on the road each new place you

stop for the night has a strangeness that makes for fitful sleep. Ideally I

wanted to stop before dark, so that I could take a wide-range view of the

surroundings and dispel a recurring fear that I had accidentally parked on an

airplane runway. But in practice I usually stopped after sunset and could judge

my sleeping spot only by what showed in the headlights. I wanted places that

were quiet but not scarily remote. I learned to identify and avoid lovers'

lanes, which would crowd up with cars later on and draw cruising cops, and teen

party spots, full of shouts and breaking glass and engine roar. Any

edge-of-town place I stopped I always checked for cigarette-butt heaps and sacks

of empty beer cans.<p>



<font size=5>I</font>F you spend a lot of time in your vehicle with the motor off, you will find

that it has a consciousness like any quick thing. Just as a horse is aware of

other horses, a car is aware of other cars. If you are parked by the side of

the road and another car goes speeding by, your car will shiver in longing and

sympathy. When a big truck passes, your car will flutter in awed excitement for

minutes afterward. Even passing airplanes cause it to prick up its ears.

Sleeping in a car is harder to do if the car is not itself asleep. For its

comfort I always tried to park near other sleeping vehicles. Idling trucks

snoring at a truck stop provided a good neighborhood. Once, not in the van but

in a vehicle that succeeded it, I found myself in a western Nebraska town on

the Saturday night after an important school football game, perhaps the

liveliest night the town would see all year. Parking on the streets was out of

the question, police were high-beaming the town park, and no truck stops

happened to be close by. Passing a used-car lot, I noticed an empty space in

the back row. I pulled into it, shut down my lights and engine, and climbed

into the back. Among the sleeping used cars my car and I spent as peaceful a

night as we ever had.<p>



<font size=5>W</font>HEN you first get under your blankets or into your sleeping bag in your car,

usually you lie quietly and just watch for a while. Your mind naturally will

parse the lights and shadows filling the car's interior, will assign to each

shadow its corresponding streetlight and to each moving plane of light the

traffic pattern from which it comes. What you don't want at all is to have

parked in a place where passing headlights fall right on your face. Also, for a

while you listen--to engines near and farther away, to tires bumping over

cattle guards, to wind. My van had leaky skylights, which I was always patching

with sealant and waterproof tape, so in even the lightest rain I listened for

drips. At the side of untraveled county roads I have tensed to the sound of my

own stomach rumbling, so similar to the quiet crunch of gravel under the wheels

of a car with headlights turned off, sneaking up to do me harm. But from a

supine position inside a car you will never detect approaching people as easily

as they will detect you. Once, parked in the parking lot of a railroad station,

I woke to see a bearded man in multiple layers of clothes peering through the

driver's-side window. For some reason I quickly grabbed a road map and became

intent over it, as if I were a traveler who had paused only a moment to get his

bearings. The bearded man rapped on the window and I reached across and rolled

it down. "I seen you last night," he said reprovingly. "You sleep here, same as

me."<p>



Because your car is your main companion, your transportation, and your shelter

twenty-four hours a day, you can develop a relationship with it that edges at

times into the unhealthy. An early symptom is the anxiety that comes over you

at the thought of being parted from your car for any duration. This makes

engine breakdown and even simple tuneups events of greater stress than they

would be for an average motorist. Once, near Canyon, Texas, my van developed

trouble in the solenoid. At unpredictable moments it wouldn't start. I took it

to a service station, where it refused to start at all. A mechanic named Harry

Buster examined it and told me what part I needed and that it would take a few

days for him to get one. We rolled the van to his small lot out back and got to

talking. Harry Buster was a descendant of the famous pioneer cattleman Oliver

Loving, and knew many details of a battle Oliver Loving had with the Comanche

which I had never read anywhere. At some point I offhandedly mentioned that of

course I would be living in my van in his lot until the van was repaired. I have

suppressed the memory of Mr. Buster's reaction to this news. I do know that I

walked with my suitcase to the cheapest motel in Canyon and waited out the

operation there.<p>



<font size=5>W</font>HEN I was little, my parents could drive great distances without tiring. They

would load my brothers and sisters and me into the back of the station wagon

and drive from our house in Ohio straight through until we were way out west.

My father liked to drive at night; often we would go to sleep in one landscape

and wake to find another, completely different, in its place. On our way back

from Arizona one winter we went to bed with windows down in spring weather in

the Ozarks and woke in a snowstorm someplace in Illinois. During the night Dad

had rigged a long tubular duct out of a bedsheet and safety pins and attached

it to a vent under the dashboard, to bring warm air to the back. I remember the

ingenuity of this device, and us kids warm in our blankets, and the

snow-covered farmland outside. I suppose that happy moments like that are what

I hoped to reproduce as a grown-up spending the night in my car.<p>



And, despite the frequent lonesomeness and strangeness of the experience, I

sometimes succeeded. Falling asleep by a side road, I could feel as if I were a

tiny part of something big, a corpuscle in a bloodstream. Though waking up in a

motel room is always more or less the same, waking up in a car is different

every time. The sunlight, the windshield vista, the morning sense of renewal,

the thought of the forty dollars saved on a motel--all can combine to create an

unexpected burst of exhilaration. Once, after spending a week with a person I

was writing about in San Antonio, I got in my van and drove 400 miles at night

through the Texas Hill Country and onto the high plains. I pulled over, slept,

woke at dawn, got out. The land was vast and flat, and the day empty of

obligation. Sun streamed from the eastern horizon and the wind carried the

smell of dust and cured hay. I drove to a caf&eacute; and ordered a big

breakfast and began to eat. The waitress came to ask how everything was, and I

said, "Great! Just great!" and she backed away from me cautiously, eyes wide.<p>



Now the sight of junk cars makes me think of the hours people spent in them,

driving and waking and sleeping. At a monster-truck car-crushing competition I

went to--an event where souped-up pickup trucks with tires six feet across try

to crush as many junk cars as they can--I looked through binoculars at an

about-to-be-crushed sedan. Someone had left a magazine on the ledge behind the

back seat, under the rear window. On the back cover of the magazine was an ad

for a premium Scotch. The monster truck roared onto the sedan's trunk, all the

sedan's tires went flat, its window imploded, and the forgotten magazine

disappeared under shattered glass.<p>



The time people spend in houses, the sense of life lived there, stays with the

houses even as they fall apart. Lived-in houses, no matter how ramshackle,

somehow remain animate, storied. But the time people spend in their cars seems

to have no dignifying effect on the cars at all.<p>



After I had driven my van for about 80,000 miles, I returned to New York for a

while and left the van in a paid parking lot on a pier by the Hudson River. One

day I came to check on it and saw that the doors were open. Thieves had broken

in, and had cut parts from the engine. They had cranked open the skylights,

too; the time of year was early summer, and I knew that they, like me, had

found out how stuffy the van could get in the sun. I called a wrecker to come

for the corpse. I imagined welding long steel spikes to the van's roof, so that

it could never be used in a monster-truck car-crushing show. But I didn't

actually do that, of course. I watched the van recede up the West Side Highway,

tilted at that woeful angle behind the tow truck. I walked back to my

apartment, surprised to discover that although my van was gone, apparently I

was still in this world.<p>

<blockquote>
	<i><font size=4>In this second of a two-part series on ghetto schools,
the author, a thirty-year-old Harvard graduate and novelist, describes the
sequence of events that led to his dismissal from one of Boston's Roxbury
schools--for bringing into his classroom reading materials he felt bridged the
gap between the ghetto environment of his pupils and the prejudices and
irrelevancies of their antiquated textbooks. The following article is taken
from Mr. Kozol's book entitled DEATH AT AN EARLY AGE, to be published this
month by Houghton Mifflin.</i></font><p>
	
	
	<pre>
	
	</pre>
	
	<font size=5>T</font>here has been so much recent talk of progress in the areas of curriculum
innovation and textbook revision that few people outside the field of teaching
understand how bad most of our elementary school materials still are. In
isolated suburban school districts children play ingenious Monopoly games
revised to impart an immediate and first-person understanding of economic
problems in the colonial period. In private schools, kindergarten children
begin to learn about numbers with brightly colored sticks known as cuisenaire
rods, and second-grade children are introduced to mathematics through the
ingenuity of a package of odd-shaped figures known as Attribute Games. But in
the majority of schools in Roxbury and Harlem and dozens of other slum
districts stretching west across the country, teaching techniques, textbooks,
and other teaching aids are hopelessly antique, largely obsolete, and often
insulting or psychologically oppressive for many thousands of Negro and other
minority schoolchildren.<p>

<p>

I once made a check of all books in my fourth-grade classroom. Of the slightly
more than six hundred books, almost one quarter had been published prior to the
bombing of Hiroshima; 60 percent were either ten years old or older. Of
thirty-two different book series standing in rows within the cupboard, only six
were published as recently as five years ago, and seven series were twenty to
thirty-five years old. These figures put into perspective some of the lofty
considerations and expensive research projects sponsored by even the best of
the curriculum development organizations, for they suggest that educational
progress and innovation are reaching chiefly the children of rich people rather
than the children of the urban poor.<p>

<p>

Obsolescence, however, was not the only problem in our textbooks. Direct and
indirect forms of discrimination were another. The geography book given to my
pupils, first published eighteen years ago and only modestly updated since,
traced a cross-country journey in which there was not one mention, hint, or
image of a dark-skinned face. The chapter on the South described an idyllic
landscape in the heart of Dixie: pastoral home of hardworking white citizens,
contented white children, and untroubled white adults.<p>

<p>

While the history book mentioned Negroes--in its discussion of slavery and the
Civil War--the tone of these sections was ambiguous. "Men treasure freedom
above all else," the narrative conceded at one point, but it also pointed out
that slavery was not an altogether dreadful institution: "Most Southern people
treated their slaves kindly," it related, and then quoted a stereotyped
plantation owner as saying: "Our slaves have good homes and plenty to eat. When
they are sick, we take care of them...."<p>

<p>

While the author favored emancipation, he found it necessary to grant to
arguments on the other side a patriotic legitimacy: "No one can truly say, 'The
North was right' or 'The Southern cause was better.' Remember, each side fought
for the ideals it believed in. For in Our America all of us have the right to
our beliefs."<p>

<p>

When my class had progressed to the cotton chapter in our geography book, I
decided to alter the scheduled reading. Since I was required to make use of the
textbook, and since its use, I believed, was certain to be damaging, I decided
to supply the class with extra material in the form of a mimeographed sheet. I
did not propose to tell the children any tales about lynchings, beatings, or
the Ku Klux Klan. I merely wanted to add to the study of cotton-growing some
information about the connection between the discovery of Eli Whitney's cotton
gin and the greater growth of slavery.<p>

<p>

I had to submit this material to my immediate superior in the school, a lady
whom I will call the Reading Teacher. The Reading Teacher was a
well-intentioned woman who had spent several years in ghetto classrooms, but
who, like many other teachers, had some curiously ambivalent attitudes toward
the children she was teaching. I recall the moment after I had handed her that
sheet of paper. Looking over the page, she agreed with me immediately that it
was accurate. Nobody, she said, was going to quibble with the idea that cotton,
the cotton gin, and slavery were all intertwined. But it was the question of
the "advisability of any mention of slavery to the children at this time,"
which, she said, she was presently turning over in her mind. "Would it," she
asked me frankly, "truly serve the advantage of the children at this stage to
confuse and complicate the study of simple geography with socioeconomic
factors?" Why expose the children, she was asking essentially, to unpleasant
facts about their heritage?<p>

<p>

Then, with an expression of the most honest and intense affection for the
children in the class, she added: "I don't want these children to have to think
back on this year later on and to remember that we were the ones who told them
they were Negro." This remark seemed to take one step further the attitude of
the textbook writers. Behind the statement lay the unspoken assumption that to
be Negro was a shameful condition. The longer this knowledge could be kept from
the innocent young, the better off they would be.<p>

<p>

After the journey across America, the class was to study the life of the desert
Arab. Before we began, the Reading Teacher urged upon me a book which she said
she had used with her own classes for a great many years. It was not the same
book the children had. She told me she preferred it, but that it was too old to
be in regular use. I took the book home that night and opened it up to a
section on the Arabs:<p>

<p>

"The Bedouin father is tall and straight. He wears a robe that falls to his
ankles and his bare feet are shod in sandals of camel's leather....Behind the
Bedouin father walk his wife and his children....<p>

<p>

These people are fine looking. Their black eyes are bright and intelligent.
Their features are much like our own, and, although their skin is brown, they
belong to the white race, as we do. It is scorching desert sun that has tanned
the skin of the Arabs to such a dark brown color."<p>

<p>

Turning to a section on Europe, I read the following description:<p>

<p>

"Two Swiss children live in a farmhouse on the edge of town....These children
are handsome. Their eyes are blue. Their hair is golden yellow. Their white
skins are clear, and their cheeks are as red as ripe, red apples."<p>

<p>

Curious after this to see how the African Negroes would be treated, I turned to
a section on the Congo Valley:<p>

<p>

"The black people who live on this great continent of Africa were afraid of the
first white men who came to explore their land. They ran and hid from them in
the dark jungle. They shot poisoned arrows from behind the thick bushes. They
were savage and uncivilized....<p>

<p>

Yumbo and Minko are a black boy and a black girl who live in this jungle
village. Their skins are of so dark a color that they look almost black. Their
noses are large and flat. Their lips are thick. Their eyes are black and
shining, and their hair is so curly that it seems like wool. They are Negroes
and belong to the black race."<p>

<p>

Perhaps without being conscious of it, the Reading Teacher had her own way of
telling the children what it meant to be Negro.<p>

<p>

Not all books used in a school system, merely by the law of averages, are going
to be consistently and blatantly poor. A large number of the books we had in
Boston were only mildly distorted or else devastatingly bad only in one part.
One such book, not used in my school but at the junior high level, was entitled
*Our World Today*. Right and wrong, good and bad alternate in this book from
sentence to sentence and from page to page:<p>

<p>

"The people of the British Isles are, like our own, a mixed people. Their
ancestors were the sturdy races of northern Europe, such as Celts, Angles,
Saxons, Danes and Normans, whose energy and abilities still appear in their
descendant. With such a splendid inheritance what could be more natural than
that the British should explore and settle many parts of the world and in time
build up the world's greatest colonial empire?...<p>

<p>

The people of South Africa have one of the most democratic governments now in
existence in any country...<p>

<p>

Africa needs more capitalists....White managers are needed...to show the
Negroes how to work and to manage their plantations....<p>

<p>

In our study of the nations of the world, we should try to understand the
people and their problems from their point of view. We ought to have a
sympathetic attitude towards them, rather than condemn them through ignorance
because they do not happen always to have our ways....<p>

<p>

The Negro is very quick to imitate and follow the white man's way of living and
dressing....<p>

<p>

The white man may remain for short periods and direct the work, but he
cannot...do the work himself. He must depend on the natives to do the
work....<p>

<p>

The white men who have entered Africa are teaching the natives how to
live...."<p>

<p>

<p>

Sooner or later books like these will be put to pasture. Either that, or they
will be carefully doctored and rewritten. But the problem they represent is not
going to be resolved in any important way by their removal or revision. Too
many teachers admire and depend on such textbooks, and prefer to teach from
them. The attitudes of these teachers are likely to remain long after the books
have been replaced.<p>

<p>

<p>

Plenty of good books are available, of course, that give an honest picture of
the lives of black Americans. The tutorial programs in Boston have been using
them, and so have many of the more enlightened private schools. In the public
schools of this city, however, it is difficult to make use of books that depart
from the prescribed curriculum. When I made a tentative effort to introduce
such materials into my classroom, I encountered firm resistance.<p>

<p>

Earlier in the year I had brought to school a book of poetry by the Negro
author Langston Hughes. I had not used it in the classroom, but it did at least
make its way onto a display board in the auditorium as part of an exhibit on
important American Negroes, set up to pay lip service to "Negro History
Week."<p>

<p>

To put a book by a Negro poet on display is one thing. To open the book and
attempt to read something from it is quite another. In the last weeks of the
spring I discovered the difference when I began to read a few of the poems to
the children in my class. It was during a period in which I also was reading
them some poems of John Crowe Ransom, Robert Frost, and W. B. Yeats.<p>

<p>

Hughes, I have come to learn, holds an extraordinary appeal for many children.
I knew this from some earlier experiences in other classes, and I remembered,
in particular, the reaction of a group of young teen-agers in a junior high the
first time I ever had brought his work into a public school. On the book's
cover, the children could see the picture of the dark-skinned author, and they
did not fail to comment. Their comments concentrated on that single, obvious,
overriding fact:<p>

<p>

"Look--that man's colored."<p>

<p>

The same reaction was evident here, too, among my fourth-grade students: the
same gratification and the same very vivid sense of recognition. It seemed a
revelation to them that a man could have black skin and be a famous author.<p>

<p>

Of all the poems of Langston Hughes that we read, the one the children liked
the best was a poem entitled "Ballad of the Landlord." The reason, I think,
that this piece of writing had so much meaning for them was not only that it
seemed moving in an obvious and immediate human way, but also that it found its
emotion in something ordinary. It is a poem which allows both heroism and
pathos to poor people, sees strength in awkwardness, and attributes to a poor
person standing on the stoop of his slum house every bit as much significance
as William Wordsworth saw in daffodils, waterfalls, and clouds. At the request
of the children, I mimeographed some copies of that poem, and although nobody
in the classroom was asked to do this, several of the children took it home and
memorized it on their own. I did not assign it for memory, because I do not
think that memorizing a poem has any special value. Some of the children just
came in and asked if they could recite it. Before long, almost every child in
the room had asked to have a turn.<p>

<p>

One day a week later, shortly before lunchtime, I was standing in front of my
class playing a record of French children's songs I had brought in. A
message-signal on the wall began to buzz. I left the room and hurried to the
principal's office. A white man whom I had never seen before was sitting by her
desk. This man, bristling and clearly hostile to me, as was the principal,
instantly attacked me for having read to my class and distributed at their wish
the poem entitled "Ballad of the Landlord." It turned out that he was the
father of one of the few white boys in the class. He was also a police
officer.<p>

<p>

The mimeograph of the poem, in my handwriting, was waved before my eyes. The
principal demanded to know what right I had to allow such a poem--not in the
official course of study--to be read and memorized by children. I said I had
not asked anyone to memorize it, but that I would defend the poem and its use
on the basis that it was a good poem. The principal became incensed with my
answer and blurted out that she did not consider it a work of art.<p>

<p>

The parent was angry as well, it turned out, about a book having to do with the
United Nations. I had brought a book to class, one of sixty or more volumes,
that told about the UN and its Human Rights Commission. The man, I believe, had
mistaken "human rights" for "civil rights" and was consequently in a patriotic
rage. The principal, in fairness, made the point that she did not think there
was anything wrong with the United Nations, although in the report later filed
on the matter, she denied this, and said, instead, "I then spoke and said that
I felt there was no need for this material in the classroom." The principal's
report went on to say that she assured the parent, after I had left the room,
that "there was not another teacher in the district who would have used this
poem or any material like it. I assured him that his children would be very
safe from such incidents."<p>

<p>

I returned to my class, as requested, and a little before two o'clock the
principal called me back to tell me I was fired. She forbade me to say good-bye
to the children in the class or to indicate in any way that I was leaving. She
said that I was to close up my records, leave the school, and report to School
Department headquarters the next morning.<p>

<p>

The next day an official who had charge of my case at the School Department
took a much harder line on curriculum innovation than I had ever heard before.
No literature, she said, which is not in the course of study could *ever* be
read by a Boston teacher without permission of someone higher up. She said
further that no poem by any Negro author could be considered permissible if it
involved suffering. I asked her whether there would be many good poems left to
read by such a standard. Wouldn't it rule out almost all great Negro
literature? Her answer evaded the issue. No poetry that described suffering was
felt to be suitable. The only Negro poetry that could be read in the Boston
schools, she indicated, must fit a certain kind of standard. The kind of poem
she meant, she said by way of example might be a poem that accentuates the
positive or "describes nature" or "tells of something hopeful."<p>

<p>

The same official went on a few minutes later to tell me that any complaint
from a parent meant automatic dismissal. "You're out," she said. "You cannot
teach in the Boston schools again. If you want to teach, why don't you try a
private school someday?"<p>

<p>

Other Boston officials backed up these assertions in statements released during
the following hectic days. The deputy superintendent, who wielded considerable
authority over these matters, pointed out that although Langston Hughes "has
written much beautiful poetry, we cannot give directives to the teacher to use
literature written in native dialects." She explained: "We are trying to break
the speech patterns of these children, trying to get them to speak properly.
This poem does not present correct grammatical expression and would just
entrench the speech patterns we want to break."<p>

<p>

A couple of weeks later, winding up an investigation into the matter, School
Committee member Thomas Eisenstadt concluded that school officials had handled
things correctly. Explaining in his statement that teachers are dismissed
frequently when found lacking in either "training, personality or character,"
he went on to say that "Mr. Kozol, or anyone else who lacks the personal
discipline to abide by rules and regulations, as we all must in our civilized
society, is obviously unsuited for the highly responsible profession of
teaching."<p>

<p>

In thinking back upon my year within the Boston system, I am often reminded of
a kind of sad-keyed epilogue that the Reading Teacher used to bring forward
sometimes at the end of a discussion: "Things are changing," she used to say
with feeling; "I am changing too--but everything cannot happen just like
that."<p>

<p>

Perhaps by the time another, generation comes around a certain modest number of
these things will have begun to be corrected. But if I were the parent of a
Negro child, I know that I would not willingly accept a calendar of
improvements scaled so slowly. The anger of the mother whose child's years in
elementary school have been squandered may seem inexplicable to a person like
the Reading Teacher. To that mother, it is the complacency and hypocrisy of a
society that could sustain and foster so many thousands of people like the
Reading Teacher that seem extraordinary. The comfortable people who don't know
and don't see the ghettos deliberate in their committee rooms. Meanwhile, the
children whose lives their decisions are either going to save or ruin are
expected to sit quietly, fold their hands patiently, recite their lessons, draw
their margins, bite their tongues, swallow their dignities, and smile and
wait.

<blockquote>
	<i><font size=4>In this second of a two-part series on ghetto schools,
the author, a thirty-year-old Harvard graduate and novelist, describes the
sequence of events that led to his dismissal from one of Boston's Roxbury
schools--for bringing into his classroom reading materials he felt bridged the
gap between the ghetto environment of his pupils and the prejudices and
irrelevancies of their antiquated textbooks. The following article is taken
from Mr. Kozol's book entitled DEATH AT AN EARLY AGE, to be published this
month by Houghton Mifflin.</i></font><p>
	
	
	<pre>
	
	</pre>
	
	<font size=5>T</font>here has been so much recent talk of progress in the areas of curriculum
innovation and textbook revision that few people outside the field of teaching
understand how bad most of our elementary school materials still are. In
isolated suburban school districts children play ingenious Monopoly games
revised to impart an immediate and first-person understanding of economic
problems in the colonial period. In private schools, kindergarten children
begin to learn about numbers with brightly colored sticks known as cuisenaire
rods, and second-grade children are introduced to mathematics through the
ingenuity of a package of odd-shaped figures known as Attribute Games. But in
the majority of schools in Roxbury and Harlem and dozens of other slum
districts stretching west across the country, teaching techniques, textbooks,
and other teaching aids are hopelessly antique, largely obsolete, and often
insulting or psychologically oppressive for many thousands of Negro and other
minority schoolchildren.<p>

<p>

I once made a check of all books in my fourth-grade classroom. Of the slightly
more than six hundred books, almost one quarter had been published prior to the
bombing of Hiroshima; 60 percent were either ten years old or older. Of
thirty-two different book series standing in rows within the cupboard, only six
were published as recently as five years ago, and seven series were twenty to
thirty-five years old. These figures put into perspective some of the lofty
considerations and expensive research projects sponsored by even the best of
the curriculum development organizations, for they suggest that educational
progress and innovation are reaching chiefly the children of rich people rather
than the children of the urban poor.<p>

<p>

Obsolescence, however, was not the only problem in our textbooks. Direct and
indirect forms of discrimination were another. The geography book given to my
pupils, first published eighteen years ago and only modestly updated since,
traced a cross-country journey in which there was not one mention, hint, or
image of a dark-skinned face. The chapter on the South described an idyllic
landscape in the heart of Dixie: pastoral home of hardworking white citizens,
contented white children, and untroubled white adults.<p>

<p>

While the history book mentioned Negroes--in its discussion of slavery and the
Civil War--the tone of these sections was ambiguous. "Men treasure freedom
above all else," the narrative conceded at one point, but it also pointed out
that slavery was not an altogether dreadful institution: "Most Southern people
treated their slaves kindly," it related, and then quoted a stereotyped
plantation owner as saying: "Our slaves have good homes and plenty to eat. When
they are sick, we take care of them...."<p>

<p>

While the author favored emancipation, he found it necessary to grant to
arguments on the other side a patriotic legitimacy: "No one can truly say, 'The
North was right' or 'The Southern cause was better.' Remember, each side fought
for the ideals it believed in. For in Our America all of us have the right to
our beliefs."<p>

<p>

When my class had progressed to the cotton chapter in our geography book, I
decided to alter the scheduled reading. Since I was required to make use of the
textbook, and since its use, I believed, was certain to be damaging, I decided
to supply the class with extra material in the form of a mimeographed sheet. I
did not propose to tell the children any tales about lynchings, beatings, or
the Ku Klux Klan. I merely wanted to add to the study of cotton-growing some
information about the connection between the discovery of Eli Whitney's cotton
gin and the greater growth of slavery.<p>

<p>

I had to submit this material to my immediate superior in the school, a lady
whom I will call the Reading Teacher. The Reading Teacher was a
well-intentioned woman who had spent several years in ghetto classrooms, but
who, like many other teachers, had some curiously ambivalent attitudes toward
the children she was teaching. I recall the moment after I had handed her that
sheet of paper. Looking over the page, she agreed with me immediately that it
was accurate. Nobody, she said, was going to quibble with the idea that cotton,
the cotton gin, and slavery were all intertwined. But it was the question of
the "advisability of any mention of slavery to the children at this time,"
which, she said, she was presently turning over in her mind. "Would it," she
asked me frankly, "truly serve the advantage of the children at this stage to
confuse and complicate the study of simple geography with socioeconomic
factors?" Why expose the children, she was asking essentially, to unpleasant
facts about their heritage?<p>

<p>

Then, with an expression of the most honest and intense affection for the
children in the class, she added: "I don't want these children to have to think
back on this year later on and to remember that we were the ones who told them
they were Negro." This remark seemed to take one step further the attitude of
the textbook writers. Behind the statement lay the unspoken assumption that to
be Negro was a shameful condition. The longer this knowledge could be kept from
the innocent young, the better off they would be.<p>

<p>

After the journey across America, the class was to study the life of the desert
Arab. Before we began, the Reading Teacher urged upon me a book which she said
she had used with her own classes for a great many years. It was not the same
book the children had. She told me she preferred it, but that it was too old to
be in regular use. I took the book home that night and opened it up to a
section on the Arabs:<p>

<p>

"The Bedouin father is tall and straight. He wears a robe that falls to his
ankles and his bare feet are shod in sandals of camel's leather....Behind the
Bedouin father walk his wife and his children....<p>

<p>

These people are fine looking. Their black eyes are bright and intelligent.
Their features are much like our own, and, although their skin is brown, they
belong to the white race, as we do. It is scorching desert sun that has tanned
the skin of the Arabs to such a dark brown color."<p>

<p>

Turning to a section on Europe, I read the following description:<p>

<p>

"Two Swiss children live in a farmhouse on the edge of town....These children
are handsome. Their eyes are blue. Their hair is golden yellow. Their white
skins are clear, and their cheeks are as red as ripe, red apples."<p>

<p>

Curious after this to see how the African Negroes would be treated, I turned to
a section on the Congo Valley:<p>

<p>

"The black people who live on this great continent of Africa were afraid of the
first white men who came to explore their land. They ran and hid from them in
the dark jungle. They shot poisoned arrows from behind the thick bushes. They
were savage and uncivilized....<p>

<p>

Yumbo and Minko are a black boy and a black girl who live in this jungle
village. Their skins are of so dark a color that they look almost black. Their
noses are large and flat. Their lips are thick. Their eyes are black and
shining, and their hair is so curly that it seems like wool. They are Negroes
and belong to the black race."<p>

<p>

Perhaps without being conscious of it, the Reading Teacher had her own way of
telling the children what it meant to be Negro.<p>

<p>

Not all books used in a school system, merely by the law of averages, are going
to be consistently and blatantly poor. A large number of the books we had in
Boston were only mildly distorted or else devastatingly bad only in one part.
One such book, not used in my school but at the junior high level, was entitled
*Our World Today*. Right and wrong, good and bad alternate in this book from
sentence to sentence and from page to page:<p>

<p>

"The people of the British Isles are, like our own, a mixed people. Their
ancestors were the sturdy races of northern Europe, such as Celts, Angles,
Saxons, Danes and Normans, whose energy and abilities still appear in their
descendant. With such a splendid inheritance what could be more natural than
that the British should explore and settle many parts of the world and in time
build up the world's greatest colonial empire?...<p>

<p>

The people of South Africa have one of the most democratic governments now in
existence in any country...<p>

<p>

Africa needs more capitalists....White managers are needed...to show the
Negroes how to work and to manage their plantations....<p>

<p>

In our study of the nations of the world, we should try to understand the
people and their problems from their point of view. We ought to have a
sympathetic attitude towards them, rather than condemn them through ignorance
because they do not happen always to have our ways....<p>

<p>

The Negro is very quick to imitate and follow the white man's way of living and
dressing....<p>

<p>

The white man may remain for short periods and direct the work, but he
cannot...do the work himself. He must depend on the natives to do the
work....<p>

<p>

The white men who have entered Africa are teaching the natives how to
live...."<p>

<p>

<p>

Sooner or later books like these will be put to pasture. Either that, or they
will be carefully doctored and rewritten. But the problem they represent is not
going to be resolved in any important way by their removal or revision. Too
many teachers admire and depend on such textbooks, and prefer to teach from
them. The attitudes of these teachers are likely to remain long after the books
have been replaced.<p>

<p>

<p>

Plenty of good books are available, of course, that give an honest picture of
the lives of black Americans. The tutorial programs in Boston have been using
them, and so have many of the more enlightened private schools. In the public
schools of this city, however, it is difficult to make use of books that depart
from the prescribed curriculum. When I made a tentative effort to introduce
such materials into my classroom, I encountered firm resistance.<p>

<p>

Earlier in the year I had brought to school a book of poetry by the Negro
author Langston Hughes. I had not used it in the classroom, but it did at least
make its way onto a display board in the auditorium as part of an exhibit on
important American Negroes, set up to pay lip service to "Negro History
Week."<p>

<p>

To put a book by a Negro poet on display is one thing. To open the book and
attempt to read something from it is quite another. In the last weeks of the
spring I discovered the difference when I began to read a few of the poems to
the children in my class. It was during a period in which I also was reading
them some poems of John Crowe Ransom, Robert Frost, and W. B. Yeats.<p>

<p>

Hughes, I have come to learn, holds an extraordinary appeal for many children.
I knew this from some earlier experiences in other classes, and I remembered,
in particular, the reaction of a group of young teen-agers in a junior high the
first time I ever had brought his work into a public school. On the book's
cover, the children could see the picture of the dark-skinned author, and they
did not fail to comment. Their comments concentrated on that single, obvious,
overriding fact:<p>

<p>

"Look--that man's colored."<p>

<p>

The same reaction was evident here, too, among my fourth-grade students: the
same gratification and the same very vivid sense of recognition. It seemed a
revelation to them that a man could have black skin and be a famous author.<p>

<p>

Of all the poems of Langston Hughes that we read, the one the children liked
the best was a poem entitled "Ballad of the Landlord." The reason, I think,
that this piece of writing had so much meaning for them was not only that it
seemed moving in an obvious and immediate human way, but also that it found its
emotion in something ordinary. It is a poem which allows both heroism and
pathos to poor people, sees strength in awkwardness, and attributes to a poor
person standing on the stoop of his slum house every bit as much significance
as William Wordsworth saw in daffodils, waterfalls, and clouds. At the request
of the children, I mimeographed some copies of that poem, and although nobody
in the classroom was asked to do this, several of the children took it home and
memorized it on their own. I did not assign it for memory, because I do not
think that memorizing a poem has any special value. Some of the children just
came in and asked if they could recite it. Before long, almost every child in
the room had asked to have a turn.<p>

<p>

One day a week later, shortly before lunchtime, I was standing in front of my
class playing a record of French children's songs I had brought in. A
message-signal on the wall began to buzz. I left the room and hurried to the
principal's office. A white man whom I had never seen before was sitting by her
desk. This man, bristling and clearly hostile to me, as was the principal,
instantly attacked me for having read to my class and distributed at their wish
the poem entitled "Ballad of the Landlord." It turned out that he was the
father of one of the few white boys in the class. He was also a police
officer.<p>

<p>

The mimeograph of the poem, in my handwriting, was waved before my eyes. The
principal demanded to know what right I had to allow such a poem--not in the
official course of study--to be read and memorized by children. I said I had
not asked anyone to memorize it, but that I would defend the poem and its use
on the basis that it was a good poem. The principal became incensed with my
answer and blurted out that she did not consider it a work of art.<p>

<p>

The parent was angry as well, it turned out, about a book having to do with the
United Nations. I had brought a book to class, one of sixty or more volumes,
that told about the UN and its Human Rights Commission. The man, I believe, had
mistaken "human rights" for "civil rights" and was consequently in a patriotic
rage. The principal, in fairness, made the point that she did not think there
was anything wrong with the United Nations, although in the report later filed
on the matter, she denied this, and said, instead, "I then spoke and said that
I felt there was no need for this material in the classroom." The principal's
report went on to say that she assured the parent, after I had left the room,
that "there was not another teacher in the district who would have used this
poem or any material like it. I assured him that his children would be very
safe from such incidents."<p>

<p>

I returned to my class, as requested, and a little before two o'clock the
principal called me back to tell me I was fired. She forbade me to say good-bye
to the children in the class or to indicate in any way that I was leaving. She
said that I was to close up my records, leave the school, and report to School
Department headquarters the next morning.<p>

<p>

The next day an official who had charge of my case at the School Department
took a much harder line on curriculum innovation than I had ever heard before.
No literature, she said, which is not in the course of study could *ever* be
read by a Boston teacher without permission of someone higher up. She said
further that no poem by any Negro author could be considered permissible if it
involved suffering. I asked her whether there would be many good poems left to
read by such a standard. Wouldn't it rule out almost all great Negro
literature? Her answer evaded the issue. No poetry that described suffering was
felt to be suitable. The only Negro poetry that could be read in the Boston
schools, she indicated, must fit a certain kind of standard. The kind of poem
she meant, she said by way of example might be a poem that accentuates the
positive or "describes nature" or "tells of something hopeful."<p>

<p>

The same official went on a few minutes later to tell me that any complaint
from a parent meant automatic dismissal. "You're out," she said. "You cannot
teach in the Boston schools again. If you want to teach, why don't you try a
private school someday?"<p>

<p>

Other Boston officials backed up these assertions in statements released during
the following hectic days. The deputy superintendent, who wielded considerable
authority over these matters, pointed out that although Langston Hughes "has
written much beautiful poetry, we cannot give directives to the teacher to use
literature written in native dialects." She explained: "We are trying to break
the speech patterns of these children, trying to get them to speak properly.
This poem does not present correct grammatical expression and would just
entrench the speech patterns we want to break."<p>

<p>

A couple of weeks later, winding up an investigation into the matter, School
Committee member Thomas Eisenstadt concluded that school officials had handled
things correctly. Explaining in his statement that teachers are dismissed
frequently when found lacking in either "training, personality or character,"
he went on to say that "Mr. Kozol, or anyone else who lacks the personal
discipline to abide by rules and regulations, as we all must in our civilized
society, is obviously unsuited for the highly responsible profession of
teaching."<p>

<p>

In thinking back upon my year within the Boston system, I am often reminded of
a kind of sad-keyed epilogue that the Reading Teacher used to bring forward
sometimes at the end of a discussion: "Things are changing," she used to say
with feeling; "I am changing too--but everything cannot happen just like
that."<p>

<p>

Perhaps by the time another, generation comes around a certain modest number of
these things will have begun to be corrected. But if I were the parent of a
Negro child, I know that I would not willingly accept a calendar of
improvements scaled so slowly. The anger of the mother whose child's years in
elementary school have been squandered may seem inexplicable to a person like
the Reading Teacher. To that mother, it is the complacency and hypocrisy of a
society that could sustain and foster so many thousands of people like the
Reading Teacher that seem extraordinary. The comfortable people who don't know
and don't see the ghettos deliberate in their committee rooms. Meanwhile, the
children whose lives their decisions are either going to save or ruin are
expected to sit quietly, fold their hands patiently, recite their lessons, draw
their margins, bite their tongues, swallow their dignities, and smile and
wait.

<font size=5>I</font>F you wanted the book on Karl, the official version 
of his creative life, it went something like this: As a very young man he'd achieved minor fame by
writing a suite of chamber works that bounded harmoniously away from the atonal
bog where serious music was shrieking and splashing like a sinking dinosaur.
Karl's sunny compositions had the sound of a new time beyond great world
wars -- the innocent, optimistic 1950s. They won a major prize, were recorded by
a first-rate quartet, and, for music from the hand of a boy, were surprisingly
influential: most experts still listed Karl among the originators of the
epochal return to consonance. But Karl himself, it was said, seduced by false
muses and beatnik foolishness, abandoned his original inspirations to devote
the rest of his career to inferior experiments in chance and randomness.<p>

<p>

The critics who made these judgments, he felt, had no talent or imagination,
and no respect, and they had utterly missed the significance of Karl's later
work. They didn't even know what "chance" and "randomness" meant. Nevertheless,
their opinions had shaped his destiny. He was fifty-eight years old, and those
precocious chamber pieces were still the only compositions of his that were
performed regularly. When he wrote them, only a few players in the world could
do them right; today they were played passably well by conservatory
students -- who were often surprised to learn that Karl was still alive.<p>

<p>

One of his own former students, Jennifer, was up in his barn studio as Karl's
car crunched down the long gravel driveway through the woods; lights were
burning in the barn's second story, and Jennifer's beat-up Japanese sedan was
parked in the cul-de-sac. Karl had been on campus the entire day, teaching in
the flourishing summer arts program invented by his wife, and he hadn't seen
Jennifer since their fight the night before -- their third or fourth fight in a
week. Jennifer was now Karl's assistant at school, though she hadn't bothered
showing up today. She copied parts for him at his studio too, and in her free
time she did her own work up there. He pulled his Land Rover into the spot
between her car and his wife's Volvo wagon. He was amazed by the realization
that he'd been famous when he was not much older than this young woman in his
work space right now. He had been the youngest professor ever to hold an
endowed chair at his college, back when the trustees were convinced they had
the next Charles Ives on their hands.<p>

<p>

Lights were burning in his house as well. He saw the shadows that Gloria cast
on the walls as she moved around preparing dinner. When he stepped out of his
vehicle, he caught the rich scent of a roast coming through the kitchen's
screened windows. He smelled freshly mown grass, too, and looked through the
barn doorway to see it on the rubber tires of the tractor. On its ground level
the barn still housed heavy equipment for the farmer who worked some of Karl's
land and mowed the meadows. The vast former hayloft was Karl's music studio. He
climbed the stairway up to it.<p>

<p>

"And what's this my nose detects?" he called out in his fairy-tale woodsman's
voice, flaring his nostrils and sniffing loudly as he entered the cavernous
place. "Methinks my nose smells blood."<p>

<p>

"Boil and bubble," Jennifer said, her back to him at the distant kitchen
counter. "Toil and trouble."<p>

<p>

Karl's studio was bigger and better-appointed than the homes of most professors
at the college, though he'd kept it, except for the bathroom, one large
unbroken space. He stood in front, where picture windows looked into the woods
from the walls framing his majestic grand piano, which rested on glossy
floorboards beneath the skylight-studded ceiling. In the year since he'd begun
his masterpiece, Karl had worked in the barn much of every night, sleeping on
the sofa bed for a few hours before dawn. He needed very little sleep these
days.<p>

<p>

"More blood, my darling?" he said, switching to the voice of a soap-opera
husband. "But sweetheart, you've made so much blood already."<p>

<p>

"<I>I need more blood,</I>" Jennifer replied, doing the vampire voice.<p>

<p>

He strode across the gleaming floor to join her at the stove. Three large pots
of blood were simmering there, Jennifer stirring them with a wooden spoon. Karl
tried to bite her neck like Dracula, but she wouldn't let him. He used to bite
her neck all the time. In the blood's bubbling turbulence he saw the chaos that
wasn't chaotic, the randomness that wasn't chance. But he saw that in almost
everything. Jennifer liked her blood fairly thick, with plenty of clots. She
seemed especially pleased with this batch. She had discovered recently that if
she reserved some cornstarch until the blood was good and hot, it produced
numerous misshapen lumps that looked grotesque sliding down her arms and
face.<p>

<p>

Jennifer was a performance artist. The blood was a prop in her act. Jennifer's
act required many props, but blood was the unifying device. She concealed
plastic sacks of the homemade blood in various articles she had with her
onstage -- a child's fluffy teddy bear, a pearl-encrusted evening bag, the bodice
of a white bridal gown. For an hour she paraded about to her own synthesizer
score, acting out dysfunctional family relationships and decrying bankrupt,
oppressive governments while the Barbie-doll world hemorrhaged around her.
Everything she touched turned to blood. For her finale she decorated a wedding
cake with a bleeding pastry bag.<p>

<p>

In Karl's opinion, her act was an embarrassing, juvenile cliche. It was also a
fraud. Jennifer did not genuinely have the elemental fixation on blood that she
portrayed herself as having. An obsession with blood was a serious thing. No,
it was merely that bodily fluids were good for one's career in the performance
game -- itself the most depraved development Karl had witnessed in his many years
in the arts. He had assumed she would grow out of it, but she was doing quite
the reverse, and now people in New York City were participating in her
delusion.<p>

<p>

"Why don't you stay for dinner?" Karl said. "Gloria's making a roast. Rare, the
way you like it."<p>

<p>

Jennifer deigned to chuckle over this, and then turned off the burners on the
stove. Her blood was finished boiling. "I was going to clean up in here."<p>

<p>

"You can do it later." He pinched her waist. "I'll help."<p>

<p>

She created her blood in his studio because her own apartment had a useless
kitchenette, and Karl, in his prosperity, had a full set of professional pots
and pans, not to mention a six-burner Viking restaurant range -- and that was
just in the barn.<p>

<p>

"Karl, I don't really feel like having dinner with you and Gloria."<p>

<p>

"You've had dinner with me and Gloria before."<p>

<p>

"I'm trying to concentrate. I don't feel like feeling stress."<p>

<p>

This batch of blood was for Jennifer's biggest engagement to date -- opening for
some famous fake in a New York performance space this weekend. She had written
new material for this occasion, and she was nervous about it. Karl blamed their
fighting on this.<p>

<p>

"I didn't get to see you at all today. I'd like you to stay."<p>

<p>

She sighed. "Fine, if you insist. Let me change."<p>
<br>

<font size=5>H</font>E came down the barn stairs into the late New Hampshire day and smelled again
his wife's cooking emanating from the house. <I>A man enjoys a nice roast in the
evening,</I> he thought, to cheer himself up, and at that instant his heart thing
happened again -- starting like a bird trying to fly in his chest and then
escalating into a vibrating punching bag that made him sit on the steps,
holding the railing and panting to ride it out. This happened to him two or
three times a week, yet his asinine doctors said that nothing was seriously
wrong with him. Their diagnosis was garden-variety arrhythmia -- an irregular
heartbeat -- and they weren't inclined to do much about it. At Karl's insistence
they had rigged wires all over his chest for twenty-four hours at a time, the
results of this surveillance pouring into a recorder clipped to a canvas belt.
Later they plotted his data on long paper scrolls. The black bursts on the
green graph paper looked like the Reaper's palm prints to Karl, the Reaper
advancing on hands and knees like a cannibal, yet one doctor after another
insisted that this was a well-known nonfatal phenomenon. They told him to cut
out coffee and booze, and to stop worrying.<p>

<p>

But Karl was more up on these things than the doctors were. For years he'd been
studying the phenomenon of chaos, of which an arrhythmic heartbeat was a
perfect example. Chaos was not nothing. It was not the absence of purpose and
structure. Chaos might even <I>be</I> structure -- what human beings called
structure -- or maybe it was structure seen from the other side. Chaos was
reality's essential ingredient. Everything had chaos in it. But chaos could
amplify and feed back, propagating until it destroyed any system it was in.
Scientists had lately discovered these things about chaos, but Karl had
intuited the truth decades ago. Had he been a scientist, he'd have won the
Nobel Prize by now. In his music he had explored chaos when it was ridiculed
and reviled. Now chaos was respectable, but Karl wasn't. Most of the
fundamental properties of reality that Karl believed in -- mind over matter, to
take an obvious example -- would eventually be discovered too, and presented to
the world on television shows, but Karl wouldn't be around to see them.<p>

<p>

The devils stopped playing their bongos in his rib cage; they were finished
laughing at him for the moment. He looked up the steps, half expecting to find
Jennifer staring down at him, but the landing was empty. He rose and walked
gingerly across the gravel drive, as though in his stocking feet. No one except
Jennifer knew this, but the masterpiece he was composing was about his erratic
heart. That was the genius of it, its beauty and raw, flawed life. That was
even its title: <I>Heart Chaos 1.</I> It literally began with the anti-rhythms of his
own mortal pump going berserk, captured one day when he held a tape recorder to
his chest despite his mortal terror. Later he transcribed the pattern beat by
beat into his overture. When it was done, <I>Heart Chaos 1</I> was going to express
perfectly what chaos really was -- the music of the world.<p>

<p>

His attack left him shaky and weak and craving a slice of roast. He entered the
kitchen and joined Gloria at the range, where she was stirring a broad saute
pan of creamy sauce with vegetables in it. A large kettle of water boiled on a
back burner.<p>

<p>

"This isn't a roast," he said. <p>

<p>

"Who said it was?" Gloria replied.<p>

<p>

"It smelled exactly like a roast. I smelled it."<p>

<p>

She turned to face him. "Karl, this smells like a roast to you?"<p>

<p>

He bent over the sauce and inhaled. "No, it doesn't. Not anymore." The aroma
dispelled most of his disappointment. He loved creamy sauces for pasta, though
they were too rich and he had no business eating them. He had brought home bad
cholesterol numbers a year before. He had no business eating roasts either, but
a person tired of broiled eggplant slices with lemon juice. "Trying to kill me
again," he said.<p>

<p>

"Out to get you," Gloria said, stirring green peas into the simmering cream.<p>

<p>

She was twelve years younger than Karl, his first student affair from his first
year at the college. Thanks largely to her, the small, pretty campus of
brownstone buildings was still a college and not some ashram or corporate
retreat. The place had been in serious trouble when Gloria left admissions six
years ago to take over the development office. Now the college had the
beginnings of a well-invested endowment, the hiring freeze was lifted,
applications were up. In meetings with the trustees the provost tried to take
credit for the school's salvation, but everybody knew Gloria was the brains
behind it.<p>

<p>

"Jennifer would like to stay for dinner," Karl said.<p>

<p>

"Fine. There's plenty to go around."<p>

<p>

A bottle of white wine was already standing open on the kitchen island. He
poured himself some and refreshed Gloria's glass. "Fair warning, though. She's
in a stinker of a mood. I think she's terrified that she doesn't have her new
lines memorized or something, that her big act isn't going to go over in New
York. She's been quite unpleasant lately."<p>

<p>

"Well, we'll have to stay off that subject then."<p>

<p>

"Or we could get on that subject. We could quiz her. Give her a test, try to
trip her up."<p>

<p>

"Karl."<p>

<p>

He looked out the window to see Jennifer crossing the cul-de-sac between the
barn and the house. She'd changed out of her blood-spattered clothes into clean
jeans and a T-shirt that said America has a reality problem.<p>

<p>

She pushed open the kitchen's screen door and stuck her head inside. "Hi. It's
me."<p>

<p>

"Hello, Jennifer," Gloria said.<p>

<p>

"We're not having a roast after all," Karl said, sipping his wine beneath the
massive oval rack of hanging pots. "We're having pasta Alfredo."<p>

<p>

"Primavera," Gloria said.<p>

<p>

"Excuse me, primavera."<p>

<p>

"Great," Jennifer said.<p>

<p>

"Karl was positive he smelled a roast," Gloria told Jennifer.<p>

<p>

"Maybe you were smelling a roast in your brain," Jennifer said. "A roast from
your past that once made you happy."<p>

<p>

Gloria laughed. "That's very funny," she said.<p>

<p>

Karl didn't think it was all that funny. It was exactly the kind of thing
Jennifer was always saying, the prototypical Jennifer statement. She would
float around New York City saying things like this, and soon some people would
be having a lot of fun with her. "You could put that in your skit," Karl said.
She disliked having her act called a skit. She didn't care for "act" either.<p>

<p>

"Maybe I will," Jennifer said. "A roast in the brain. I like it."<p>

<p>

Karl caught Gloria glaring at him over her shoulder. "Wine?" he asked Jennifer.
"Or would it fog your mind?"<p>

<p>

Jennifer laughed. "Nothing could fog my mind more than it's fogged already."<p>

<p>

The girl was the most amazing fount of truth sometimes. Karl poured a glass and
handed it to her.<p>

<p>

Gloria slid coiled noodles into the boiling kettle and stirred them around, and
then turned to bestow a gracious smile upon Jennifer. "What's your mind so
fogged about?" she asked.<p>

<p>

Whenever Karl watched Gloria socialize, he understood how she could put on her
handsome tailored ladies' suits, fly around the country with her computer, and
come home with her briefcase full of money for the college. Karl couldn't get a
Rotary Club to give him twenty cents. Gloria had "people skills" in spades. She
made people feel good about themselves. Somebody had to do it.<p>

<p>

"I'm fogged from working on my show," Jennifer said. "I've been rewriting my
script and rewriting my music and trying to memorize everything and stay calm
about it."<p>

<p>

"Plus doing your work for Karl."<p>

<p>

"Yeah, that too."<p>

<p>

"Plus making lots of blood," Karl added.<p>

<p>

"Right, let's not forget the blood," Jennifer said, and laughed.<p>

<p>

"Are you excited about performing in New York?" Gloria asked.<p>

<p>

"Of course! I'm psyched. I'm nervous, too."<p>

<p>

"Working there is really important, I guess? As opposed to in other cities?"<p>

<p>

"Oh, totally," Jennifer said. "I mean, people do performance in, like, Seattle,
and <I>Minneapolis,</I> and stuff, but it's not the same thing. People in New York
recognize only two or three area codes, and if you don't have one of them, they
don't even call you. To tell you the truth, even living up here is becoming an
impediment to me."<p>

<p>

"I'm not surprised," Gloria said. "We're sort of in the middle of nowhere here.
Aren't we?"<p>

<p>

"Living here is an impediment?" Karl said. "Since when?"<p>

<p>

"Maybe Jennifer is just realizing it," Gloria said.<p>

<p>

"That's it exactly," Jennifer said. "It's just dawning on me. All the work for
this show has made me realize how much harder it is not to be there."<p>

<p>

"Makes perfect sense," Gloria said.<p>

<p>

"Are you saying you're thinking about moving to New York?" Karl said.<p>

<p>

"I've thought about it, yeah."<p>

<p>

He stepped out from behind the kitchen island. Gloria had her eye on him.
"When?"<p>

<p>

"If I did it, I'd probably do it pretty soon."<p>

<p>

"Jennifer, school starts in two months. You're supposed to teach sections of
the intro course. You wanted an instructor appointment. I got you one."<p>

<p>

The blood had rushed to Jennifer's face. She stood, looking mortified, her
wineglass quavering and her free hand stuck in a back pocket of her jeans.<p>

<p>

"Karl," Gloria said, "they can easily find a replacement for Survey of Western
Music."<p>

<p>

"That's not the point, Gloria."<p>

<p>

"Then what's the point?"<p>

<p>

He looked at Jennifer and squeezed an exasperated laugh out of himself. "I
guess the point is, when were you planning to tell the department?"<p>

<p>

"I wanted to get this performance behind me and then figure it out."<p>

<p>

Gloria put her hand on Jennifer's shoulder. "I know more about this college
than he does. Take your opportunities. Somebody else will cover the course."
Suddenly the noodles foamed and boiled over on the stove. "You two are making
me forget what I'm doing! Go sit down! Both of you!"<p>

<p>

When they were all at the table with portions of dinner before them, Gloria
poured more wine and proposed a toast. "To Jennifer's success in New York. I'm
sure you'll be great."<p>

<p>

"Thank you," Jennifer said.<p>

<p>

Karl was fuming in his chair. "Here's wishing you minor fame," he said, and
smiled witheringly before sipping his wine.<p>

<p>

"Thanks, but I think I already have that," Jennifer said.<p>

<p>

Karl heard this like a schizophrenic hearing voices. He looked to see if Gloria
had heard it too, but he couldn't tell. "You don't say," he said.<p>

<p>

"Yeah, I think you could say I'm kind of minor famous." She turned to Gloria.
"Some pretty important critics in New York are talking about my work."<p>

<p>

"Karl's been telling me," Gloria said. "Congratulations."<p>

<p>

Jennifer shrugged her shoulders. "I mean, you know it's not real," she added.
"You don't let yourself believe in it. You don't think about it when you're
working. But as long as you don't, it's not a bad thing. It helps."<p>

<p>

"That sounds like a very wise attitude," Gloria said, smiling and touching
Jennifer's arm. "For someone so wonderfully young."<p>

<p>

Karl sat like a man who had been turned to stone. "Indeed," he said. He had
told Jennifer those very things, in those words exactly.<p>
<br>

<font size=5>H</font>E didn't pretend to be jolly at dinner, though Jennifer and Gloria did, and
when dinner was over, Jennifer announced that she was going out to the barn to
clean up her blood, and then she was going home to get ready for her trip to
New York. Karl remained at the table with the second bottle of wine while
Gloria cleaned the kitchen. For some time he'd felt that he was living in a bad
knockoff of the world, or that the world itself had taken a fall on the head
and was suffering from amnesia. Nobody remembered anything. Everything Karl saw
in the arts was a watery reflection of something he'd seen firsthand decades
before, but nobody was saying that. Nobody seemed to recall that all the
currently fashionable gestures had been made before, and made better, by better
people in a better time. But the most galling thing was Karl's feeling,
something he could not really pin down, that Jennifer had stolen the whole
blood business from him.<p>

<p>

Gloria finished in the kitchen and came into the dining room. "Hey, how about
that America with the reality problem?" she said, and laughed, but Karl didn't
laugh back. "Oh, Karl, cheer up, will you?" <p>

<p>

Karl poured the last of the wine into his glass. Cheering up, promoting good
cheer, was actually Gloria's profession, for what was fund-raising if not
leading the crowd in a cheer? Institutional-endowment people were really
brilliant con artists, but he didn't see how she could stand the life. Once in
a while he attended some college event with her, and watched in horror as
hundreds of people cheered one another.<p>

<p>

"I'm disappointed to see how little I taught someone who seemed to be a gifted
student," he said. "The syndrome is a common one that we professors suffer
from. Jennifer turns out to believe that if she doesn't get opportunities for
exhibitionism in New York, her creative life isn't worth living."<p>

<p>

"Well, for what she wants to do, that's true, isn't it?"<p>

<p>

"And what's that? What she wants to do?"<p>

<p>

"Her theater stuff. Whatever it is."<p>

<p>

"She's not doing 'theater stuff,' Gloria. She's perpetrating a hoax on the
public. It's the same thing in music and painting -- kids getting lionized for
discovering their belly buttons."<p>

<p>

"You were lionized as a kid," she said.<p>

<p>

"For discovering my belly button?" he cried out.<p>

<p>

"For having something new to say."<p>

<p>

"These kids do not have something new to say. But that's not even the point.
The point is, she'll be eaten alive down there. Devoured like prey."<p>

<p>

"Lots of kids go to New York to do art and don't get devoured like prey."<p>

<p>

"Jennifer will be devoured. She puts out a certain vibration. She invites it."
And then, as though one thing followed from the other, he said, "I don't like
helping people and then being treated with disrespect."<p>

<p>

"She's young, Karl."<p>

<p>

"I wasn't like that when <I>I</I> was young. Were you like that?"<p>

<p>

"I don't know. You tell me. You knew me then."<p>

<p>

"No, you were not like that. You were infinitely better than that. Kids today
are off the map. This whole fucking civilization is out the window." He stood
up from the table. "I'm asking her to leave right now. I'll clean up her mess
myself. I have work to do tonight."<p>

<p>

He kicked across the driveway, splashing gravel against the cars. In his
twenty-five years at the college plenty of pretty girls had thrown themselves
at him, and he'd slept with a number of them. True, girls threw themselves at
other professors, too, and some of those professors practiced restraint. But
none of those professors had lived through the experience of minor fame.<p>

<p>

He stomped up the studio stairs, stood beside his grand piano, and called
across the high-ceilinged space, "You expected me to leave her for you, didn't
you? That's what this is all about."<p>

<p>

Jennifer swung around at the sink. "Are you kidding me? I think <I>she</I> should
leave <I>you</I>."<p>

<p>

"You think you should have dumped this news on me in front of my wife?"<p>

<p>

"Karl, don't talk to me like the big father, okay?"<p>

<p>

He barked a bitter laugh. This was the major theme of their recent
fighting -- Karl's being the big, controlling father. When she had studied with
him at the college, his being the big father was the thing she'd loved; he
happened to know that, even if she wouldn't admit it now. "All right, Jennifer,
fine. But I hope you're planning to be careful what you say. Some people would
assume I took advantage of you."<p>

<p>

She snorted. "Who do you think seduced who, anyway?"<p>

<p>

He was going schizo again, hearing things. "What?"<p>

<p>

"I said, Who do you think started this? I seduced you, not the other way
around."<p>

<p>

He must have drunk more wine than he realized. He was going in slow motion and
Jennifer was in normal time. He stood there saying nothing.<p>

<p>

"I decided to have an affair with you, and I initiated it," Jennifer went on.
"Think back."<p>

<p>

"And now you've initiated another one with some boy in New York."<p>

<p>

"That would be none of your business."<p>

<p>

He looked around the studio for her red milk jugs. "Jennifer, I don't see your
blood."<p>

<p>

"It's in the car."<p>

<p>

"Then why don't you go join it?"<p>

<p>

When she passed him on her way to the stairs, he said, "You know, something
occurred to me tonight. You never did your blood thing until I told you about
my heart symphony."<p>

<p>

"You're paranoid, Karl. You're sick. I have my own ideas."<p>

<p>

"Do you? I think I've had a pretty big influence on you."<p>

<p>

"Influence? I <I>hate</I> your music."<p>

<br>

<font size=5>O</font>N one of his bookshelves he had a few excellent cigars in a humidor, cigars
he'd been saving for the right visitor or some special excuse to celebrate. He
loved cigars, but he wasn't allowed to smoke them anymore. He snipped one and
lit it, and squirted a volume of blue smoke into the air -- a textbook example of
chaos, swirling smoke, along with the weather and the flight of butterflies.<p>

<p>

He was a first-rate composer, the real goddamn lifelong thing, and he was going
to put his feelings into his music and have a good night of work no matter
what. He was not throwing away his discipline because he'd crossed paths with a
self-deceived suburban girl. He was coming out of this just fine. But first he
had to clean the studio kitchen; he couldn't write with Jennifer's bloody mess
staring back at him from across the room. He clamped his cigar in his teeth and
started washing one of the pots covered with congealed stage gore. It was even
more realistic dry than wet, and when it did get wet, it dissolved and got all
over his hands, and upset him. He started to succumb to nasty Charles Manson
imagery and graphic imaginings of the bloody metronome throbbing away behind
his breastbone. He threw the pot back in the sink and pulled a folding Japanese
screen in front of the whole affair.<p>

<p>

He paced the floor, hazing the big studio with blue smoke. The realization came
to him, in that sickeningly palpable way you can't endure for more than a
second or two, that he was going to die. <I>What an abomination,</I> he thought,
almost out loud. <I>That a man like me should return to dust.</I><p>

<p>

He stood at the piano and looked at his messy score. It didn't tell him
anything. Nothing transcendental was clamoring to get out of him at the moment.
He sat on the bench, opened a manila folder, and unfurled a length of green
paper portraying his monitored heart. He'd gotten some sections of these graphs
from the clinic, and he'd been consulting them while composing <I>Heart Chaos 1.</I>
They'd proved surprisingly inspirational -- the physical shapes on the paper
suggesting sound and structure to him, telling him what to write. Now he found
a burst of heart static he liked, and played something on the keys to go with
it, but what came out was the most pointlessly ugly music he'd ever heard in
his life.<p>

<p>

He got up and walked to one of his big picture windows. Beyond his reflection
small lights were flashing like the eyes of night spirits. It was July, and
fireflies were floating around by the hundreds, tails lighting and then fading
to black, here and there, you never knew where, their movements looking
perfectly random to human beings not privy to the secrets of firefly love. A
three-quarters moon washed its ghost light over the mown meadow beneath the
window, and when Karl raised his eyes to look deeper into the pasture, his
heart gave a huge, terrifying lurch. Someone was out there in the meadow,
lurking around his secluded house in the middle of the night. He moved down the
stairway, opened the door quietly, and stepped out onto the landing. The
intruder was hiding something in the underbrush, or looking for something
hidden there. After a few seconds he saw that it was his wife, hovering at the
tangle of brambles that lined the edge of the meadow. "Gloria!" he called out
to her.<p>

<p>

She spun around in the moonlight. "You scared me!" she cried.<p>

<p>

"<I>I</I> scared <I>you!</I>" he answered, thinking, <I>I, who might never 
come back from a scare like that.</I> He walked toward Gloria through the 
lightning bugs, ducking their lethargic flashing bodies.  "What are you 
doing?" he asked from afar.<p>

<p>

"Picking raspberries," she replied, speaking into the bushes.<p>

<p>

"For what?"<p>

<p>

"Because they're feeding the birds out here, or just falling on the ground and
rotting."<p>

<p>

Deep thickets of raspberries bordered the meadow in back of the house. In years
past Karl and Gloria had made pies from the fruit of these bushes, but they
hadn't done it this year or last, or maybe not for a few years. Fresh raspberry
pie seemed almost a dream thing to Karl now, a creation tasted on vacation in
some exotic place and not available in ordinary life at home.<p>

<p>

He reached his wife beneath the moon. "Are you planning to make a pie?" he
asked.<p>

<p>

"I don't know what I'm planning to do," she said. She had a large plastic tub
from the kitchen, big enough to hold berries for at least two pies. She had a
snifter of brandy, too, glinting on the freshly mown grass, completely out of
character for Gloria. Karl was the late-night-brandy type, not she.<p>

<p>

"Can I have a sip of your drink?" he asked, and when she didn't answer, he
picked it up from the ground and had one.<p>

<p>

She took it back from him and had a sip herself. "You smell like a cigar," she
said.<p>

<p>

He looked down at his left hand. The cigar was hanging between his fingers.
He'd forgotten it was there. "I was in the mood for one."<p>

<p>

"Having a party?"<p>

<p>

"No more than you, apparently."<p>

<p>

"We're both having a party," Gloria said. "But not the same party."<p>

<p>

"You're not really the party type."<p>

<p>

"I'm not a fun person?"<p>

<p>

"I meant the type for that kind of party."<p>

<p>

"What kind?"<p>

<p>

"Never mind. I'm losing track of this conversation." He took a puff on the
cigar, but it was no longer lit. Some utterance evidently needed to be made,
some accounting of himself to his wife. "Listen," he said. "I've been wanting
to talk to you. I'm sorry I've had to work so hard lately."<p>

<p>

"But you've always worked hard," Gloria said. "Is there something unusual about
your working hard now?"<p>

<p>

"I feel especially under pressure. I feel I have a lot of work to do in a
limited time."<p>

<p>

"We all have limited time, Karl, including you. But not because there's
anything wrong with your heart." She put down her brandy snifter and continued
to pluck the biggest berries out of the tangled, moonlit leaves. "But you <I>have</I>
been especially passionate about your work this year -- sleeping out in the barn
all those nights and everything. You've been especially intense about whatever
you're doing out there."<p>

<p>

"What I'm doing out there is creating a masterpiece," Karl said.<p>

<p>

"Aren't you always?"<p>

<p>

"I don't know what you're saying, Gloria."<p>

<p>

"You told me once that in order to be able to create anything at all, you had
to feel you were creating a masterpiece. You said that was the only possible
attitude toward work. Didn't you tell me that?"<p>

<p>

He had, in fact, told her that, and it was true, but he made a mental note to
stop telling people things. "Except that this time I'm really doing that."<p>

<p>

"Really? Are you worried to be so sure? You told me that artists are never sure
they're creating a masterpiece but that's a good thing, because being sure is
bad. The point is not to be sure and to do it anyway, on faith."<p>

<p>

Life chose this instant to reveal to Karl that the "1" in <I>Heart Chaos 1</I> would
be one of his little jokes, because there would be no <I>Heart Chaos 2.</I> After
<I>Heart Chaos 1</I> he would write no more music. He would fall silent. He just
couldn't take it anymore. He was feeling surprisingly good and righteous about
this decision when, out of the blue, he remembered the radical black student
from the 1960s who, in some curriculum dispute, had become briefly famous for
calling Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms "old dead punks." Karl hadn't thought about
this in years, and the memory of it cheered him out of all proportion to its
real significance. He actually broke into a grin. "I guess I've told you just
about everything, haven't I?"<p>

<p>

Gloria laughed the way people laugh sometimes when the doctor touches a place
that hurts. "No, not quite everything," she said, and held out her plastic tub
for the few berries he'd picked.<p>

<p>

When he opened his hand above her container, she pulled it away and his berries
fell on the ground. He stared at their dark bodies on the matted grass
mowings.<p>

<p>

"Young Jennifer stopped in to see me as she was leaving," Gloria said.<p>

<p>

Karl stopped breathing and waited for his heart to self-destruct, but the
perverse vital organ beat on like a clock. "Oh? And what did she have to
say?"<p>

<p>

"The part I can't get over," Gloria continued, "is that you disliked her so
much. You thought she was silly. You ridiculed her all the time."<p>

<p>

"I did not ridicule her all the time."<p>

<p>

"Yes, you did, in all sorts of little ways."<p>

<p>

The situation was getting completely out of hand, and he was not going to allow
that to happen. No person living on earth understood self-discipline better
than Karl did. He stood up straight and composed himself. "Did Jennifer tell
you how much she hated my work?"<p>

<p>

"No."<p>

<p>

"Well, she told me. She didn't spare me one speck of nasty truth tonight. But
back when she wanted me to do things for her, my work was the greatest. You
want the topper? She shamelessly stole her whole blood idea from the symphony
I'm working on."<p>

<p>

"You're writing a symphony about blood?" Gloria said, with a look of
disbelief.<p>

<p>

"It's not about blood as such."<p>

<p>

"Then how could Jennifer steal it?"<p>

<p>

Karl thought back to the experience of waking up this morning and wondered
where he'd missed the sign. There had to have been one. A day like this would
not arrive unannounced. "I don't deny that I made a mistake with Jennifer."<p>

<p>

"Really," said his wife, wafting the brandy snifter beneath her nose.<p>

<p>

"I should never have kept her here after she graduated. I thought she was ready
for responsibility, but it only prolonged her adolescence. I thought she was a
mature person, but you were right, Gloria: she's young. She didn't even show up
on campus to do her duties today. She left me to do the things she gets paid to
do, but let me ask you this: Who does the things I get paid to do? Jennifer has
a serious problem. It's going to hold her back in life."<p>

<p>

"Is it a reality problem, do you think?"<p>

<p>

"Yes, it is. She thinks she's the center of the world."<p>

<p>

Gloria sipped her brandy, and when Karl reached for the snifter to have some
too, she pulled it away to keep it to herself. "The center of the world," she
said. "That's a crowded place."<p>

He had served one term in Congress, where his	record had not found favor with his Illinois constituents; now the door of	patronage had been slammed in his face, so Lincoln settled back into the	routine of a country lawyer riding circuit spring and fall, pleading cases at	court sessions in seven county towns. What he learned from this experience and	what it was that sprung him from this rut constitute a turning point in his	life.</i></font><p>		<p>		<p><br><p><br>		<font size=5>T</font><font size=3>he Illinois prairies were thrusting forth new life in early April, 1854, as	Abraham Lincoln hitched "Old Buck" to his buggy and prepared to set forth on	his customary round of the Eighth Judicial circuit. Bidding good-by to his wife	and their three boys--Robert, aged ten; Willie, three; and "Tad," the baby,	born just a year before --Lincoln tossed a threadbare carpetbag containing	shirts, underwear, a homemade yellow flannel nightgown, and other necessities	into the buggy, swung his long body after it, "cluck-clucked" to his horse, and	turned northward through Springfield's more prosperous residential section	toward the open country. Ahead of him lay a journey of some four hundred miles	that would keep him away from home almost ten weeks, with stops for court	sessions at seven county towns.<p>		<p>		<p>		Lincoln loved the life of the circuit--the excitement of court week in the	small country towns, the camaraderie of judge and lawyers, the speechmaking and	sociability in the evenings, and the esteem in which the simple country people	held the members of the bar. He had not expected to follow the circuit this	long, however; and if his thoughts turned inward on this first leg of his	journey, he could look back on a quick rise in life followed by a	disillusionment that held him to circuit practice. For Lincoln, pulling himself	loose from the poverty and aimlessness that marked his background, had learned	to use his brain instead of brawn as a means of livelihood; then, employing the	law as a springboard, he had rapidly advanced in politics. After serving four	terms in the state legislature, he had aspired to go to Congress. Whig party	rivalries stood in his way at first; but after he had waited for two other	zealous young Whigs to satisfy a similar ambition, his turn had come at last.	In December, 1847, he had stepped forth on the national stage.<p>		<p>		<p>		Thus, in Lincoln's early manhood, while the law provided bread and butter,	politics became his life. For fifteen years he had spent hour after hour	attending caucuses, conventions, and legislative sessions, writing party	circulars and delivering party speeches, formulating party policy and directing	party strategy. Then, during his term in Congress, had come discomfiture: he	lost step with the people of his district by opposing the Mexican War.<p>		<p>		<p>		When war with Mexico began, during Lincoln's campaign for Congress, a fervid	martial spirit swept the prairies; and if he harbored any feelings that his	country might be wrong he had kept them to himself. By the time he reached	Washington, the fighting had stopped. But peace terms were yet to be agreed on,	and he found that his fellow Whigs in Congress, looking to the election of	1848, were intent upon making political capital by accusing President Polk of	bringing on an unjust war against a feeble neighbor.<p>		<p>		<p>		Lincoln fell in with this policy and joined the clamor against Polk. He	introduced a series of resolutions designed to convict Polk of falsehood in his	claim that Mexico had started hostilities by "invading our territory and	shedding American blood on American soil." This was not so, Lincoln asserted;	Mexico, not the United States, exercised jurisdiction over the "spot" where the	first blood had been shed. Three weeks later Lincoln took the floor to amplify	his charges and challenge Polk to answer them. Throughout the session he voted	consistently with the Whig minority on all matters designed to put the	President in the wrong. And when the Democrats introduced a resolution of	thanks to General Zachary Taylor for his victory at Buena Vista, Lincoln joined	with other Whigs in amending it to read, "in a war unconstitutionally and	unjustly begun by the President."<p>		<p>		<p>		The letters in which Lincoln tried to justify his actions to his law partner,	William H. Herndon, are forthright with conviction, notwithstanding Lincoln's	silence on the subject before he left for Washington. But Lincoln, the young	Whig politician, had been reared to party discipline; and thrown among the	national stalwarts of his party as a freshman congressman, he may have been	convinced with undue ease.<p>		<p>		<p>		In any event the outcome proved ruinous for Lincoln. Back home, where people's	patriotism and land hunger overrode any moral qualms they may have felt about	the war, he was blasted throughout his district as a disgrace to his state.	Democratic newspapers dubbed him "Spotty" Lincoln, and one even labeled him "a	modern Benedict Arnold."<p>		<p>		<p>		Heretofore Lincoln's district had been accounted such a Whig stronghold that	the Whig nomination was tantamount to election. By reason of an understanding	among certain Whig leaders of the district that they would take a "turn about"	in Congress, he did not stand for re-election. But his course had so	discredited the party that Stephen T. Logan, the Whig candidate to succeed him,	lost to Thomas L. Harris, Democrat. The powerful Whig organization managed to	keep the vote extremely close--7201 for Harris to 7095 for Logan; and Lincoln	tried to explain the defeat on the ground of Logan's unpopularity and Harris's	excellent war record. But the Illinois State Register came nearer to the truth	when it complained: "This will not do, gentlemen, you must put the saddle on	the right horse....Besides his own dead weight, Logan had to carry the votes of	the Whig party, including Lincoln, that the war was unconstitutional and	unnecessary."<p>		<p>		<p>		This congressional election took place in August, 1848, and by the time of the	presidential election, in November, the Whigs, with General Zachary Taylor, a	military hero as their candidate, succeeded in bringing the district	right-side-up again. Lincoln, intent on proving that his course had caused no	change of sentiment in the district, worked harder in this contest than he had	ever worked before, and claimed the chief credit for this local victory. He had	also labored zealously for Taylor's nomination, even at the cost of abandoning	his political idol, Henry Clay. Now, with the Whigs in control of the federal	government, Lincoln, jobless and reluctant to return to the less eventful life	of Springfield, sought the politician's reward.<p>		<p>		<p>		He asked for the commissionership of the General Land Office in Washington, but	it went to a Chicagoan, an indication of the increasing political importance of	the booming city on the lake; and the most that the administration Would offer	him was the governorship or secretaryship of far-off Oregon Territory. Lincoln	had also thought that he and Edward D. Baker, who would be the sole Illinois	Whig in the next Congress, should control the federal patronage in Illinois.	But their recommendations for office were consistently ignored. It was as	though the door to a political future had been slammed shut in Lincoln's face.	By the summer of 1849 he had no choice but to return to Springfield and settle	once again into the routine of a country lawyer.<p>		<p>		<p>		So every spring and fall for the past four years, he had started out on the	circuit, as he was doing now, leaving home and family for nine or ten weeks at	a time, driving over muddy or dusty roads, now under a hot sun and again	through pelting showers or all-day rain, putting up with the scanty comforts	and monotonous fare of cheap hotels and boarding houses, where the lawyers	slept two in a bed and six or eight in a room, and spending long hours in court	for the ten, twenty, or fifty dollar fees, occasionally supplemented by larger	ones, which, along with the more substantial fees he earned in the State	Supreme Court and the Federal Courts in Springfield and the interest he	received from a few notes and mortgages, added up to an annual income of some	$2500.<p>		<p>		<p>		<font size=4><b>2.</font></b><p>		<p>		Many lawyers settled down into contented mediocrity in such a way of life, but	Lincoln, with the avenue of political advancement seemingly closed to him,	resolved to make himself a better lawyer and more enlightened man. So, as "Old	Luck" plodded on from one town to another along the familiar prairie roads,	Lincoln often lolled back in his buggy, his long legs over the dashboard, with	an open book in hand: Robert Burns or Shakespeare, those favorites of his young	manhood, or perhaps some scientific textbook having learned the value of	mathematics as a mental discipline, he mastered the first six books of Euclid;	and he also studied astronomy.<p>		<p>		<p>		Thus Lincoln's ambition, which Herndon, without fully comprehending, compared	to a little engine that knew no rest, and which Lincoln, in his first campaign	for public office, described as a desire "of being truly esteemed of my fellow	men by rendering myself worthy of their esteem," carried over into these years	of political retirement and induced him to continue that process of	self-teaching that had distinguished his earlier years.<p>		<p>		<p>		Though Lincoln appreciated the knowledge to be gained from books, observation	and experience remained his chief instructors, as they had always been. A	fellow lawyer remembered how, when Lincoln encountered a new piece of farm	machinery on his circuit travels, he should examine it in all its parts, first	closely, then at a distance, and finally, coming back to it, he would shake it,	lift it, push it, "sight" it to see whether it was straight or warped, and	stoop, or even lie down if necessary, to look under it in order to ascertain	its every quality and utility. In the lawyers' evening discussions, which	"ranged through the universe of thought and experience," he learned to apply	the same careful process to propositions and ideas.<p>		<p>		<p>		A man of deep emotions, Lincoln craved the power to put his feelings into	words. Of a commonplace poem he had once declared: "I would give all I am worth	and go in debt, to be able to write so fine a piece as I think that is"; and,	unsatisfied with the clarity and fluency that are the lawyer's tools, he had	attempted to write poems of his own.<p>		<p>		<p>		Some notes for a law lecture, which Lincoln drew up at this season of his life	but never used, reveal not only his attitude toward his profession but also	something of the man himself. "I am not an accomplished lawyer," he wrote. "I	find quite as much material for a lecture in those points wherein I have	failed, as in those wherein I have been moderately successful. The leading rule	for the lawyer, as for the man in every other calling, is diligence. Leaving	nothing for tomorrow which can be done today. Never let your correspondence	fall behind. Whatever piece of business you have in hand, before stopping, do	all the labor pertaining to it which can then be done....Extemporaneous	speaking should be practiced and cultivated. It is the lawyer's avenue to the	public....<p>		<p>		<p>		"There is a vague popular belief that lawyers are necessarily dishonest....Let	no young man choosing the law for a calling for a moment yield to the popular	belief--resolve to be honest at all events; and if in your own judgment you	cannot be an honest lawyer, resolve to be honest without being a lawyer. Choose	some other occupation, rather than one in the choosing of which you do, in	advance, consent to be a knave."<p>		<p>		<p>		Honesty became Lincoln's best-known attribute around the circuit, and next to	that his gift of storytelling. "Lord, wasn't he funny," one friend later wrote;	while another with the free-wheeling exaggeration of the frontiersman recalled:	"In the role of story teller I never knew his equal. His power of mimicry was	very great. He could perfectly mimic a Dutchman, Irishman or Negro....I have	heard men say that they had laughed at his stories until they had almost shaken	their ribs loose." Lincoln's humor often served a useful purpose. Abstruse	points became clear to the slowest minds on a jury when Lincoln explained them	with a story; and his quick perception of the ludicrous and the ridiculous	enabled him to unmask pretense and vanity and hold things in true	perspective.<p>		<p>		<p>		Notwithstanding Lincoln's geniality he was a lonely man; for there was a	remoteness and innate dignity about him that kept acquaintances at arm's	length. Most people addressed him as "Mr. Lincoln" or ''Lincoln.'' Not even	stout, jovial Judge David Davis or any of his other intimates felt sufficiently	free and easy with him to call him "Abe."<p>		<p>		<p>		He neither smoked nor drank, and seldom swore; yet he never moralized of those	who did, and he had jokingly applied to himself the saying that a man with no	vices is likely also to lack virtues.<p>		<p>		<p>		<font size=4><b>3.</font></b><p>		<p>		Something of Lincoln's life struggle might be discerned in his face. The early	death of his mother in the Indiana wilderness, a rude upbringing verging on the	uncouth, the batterings of rough-and-tumble frontier politics, a mental	breakdown resulting from uncertainty about love, the hurts of a not altogether	happy marriage, the loss of an infant son--all these had added their tracings	to the toil marks that seamed his features. Yet his face was kindly for all	that: for the buffetings of life had sensitized instead of hardening him, and	patience, tolerance, forbearance, and forgiveness were becoming the very	texture of his heart.<p>		<p>		<p>		Also a part of Lincoln's very being was a faith in the worth and fundamental	goodness of plain people, like those whom he grew up with, those at the little	village of New Salem who helped him get a start in life, and those he knew now	on the circuit. Still vivid in his memory was a time when, as a boy in	backwoods Indiana, he had lain at full length on the cabin floor before the	open fire, reading Parson Weems's life of George Washington. But what moved	him, even more than the deeds and character of Washington, was the heroism of	the Revolutionary soldiers, and he could remember thinking, "boy even though I	was, that there must have been something more than common that those men	struggled for."<p>		<p>		<p>		And as he overcame the obstacles of poverty and grew in mind and character, the	story of America took on rich meaning for him. In no other country of the	world, he thought, were ordinary people so much the masters of their destiny.	Nowhere else were they offered such a chance to rise through their own efforts.	As he carved out his own career in law and politics, all about him, at home and	on the circuit, he saw men who, starting life as laborers, mechanics, mill	hands, and flatboatmen, or in other lowly walks of life, had become lawyers,	merchants, doctors, farmers, editors, successful politicians. And he saw these	people come together in equality and mutual respect, not only in the state	legislature and in Congress, but also at the grass-roots level, in private	homes and crossroads meetinghouses, to make their own decisions and work out	their own problems under a political system "conducing more essentially to	civil and religious liberty," he thought, "than any of which the history of	former times tells us." As the years passed, he had arrived at the conviction	that the Founding Fathers of the new republic had embodied its true meaning in	the document that gave it birth, and that in the assertion of the Declaration	of Independence that all men are created equal and are alike entitled to life,	liberty, and the pursuit of happiness was a promise "not only to the people of	this country, but hope for the world to all future time."<p>		<p>		<p>		Religion and the Bible had been important in Lincoln's upbringing but he had	known skepticism too. During his campaign for Congress, when pressed to define	his faith, he had declared: "That I am not a member of any Christian church is	true; but I have never denied the truth of the Scriptures." This is not the	same as saying that he accepted the Scriptures fully; and, having trained his	mind to demand proof, he had not yet gained that broader understanding of how	the incomprehensible may still be true. Yet his very goodness bespoke a latent	spirituality, which, if awakened and motivated, might widen his horizon and	make his life more purposeful. Those who failed to penetrate his surface	qualities saw only the old melancholy that could change so quickly to	boisterous laughter, the rustic mannerisms that had clung to him since boyhood,	and the shambling gait of the man whose feet have been accustomed to plowed	ground. The tall hat with the well-rubbed nap, the long coat bulging at the	elbows, the ill-fitting trousers and unblacked boots might have passed for the	same toggery he first wore around the circuit.<p>		<p>		<p>		Though Lincoln's complex and sometimes contradictory personality made him	difficult to understand, his warm human qualities drew people to him, and he	could count a host of friends. In fact, his first stop on this trip around the	circuit would be at Lincoln, the newly founded county seat of Logan County, a	town named in his honor.<p>		<p>		<p>		These friends could muster an impressive tally if he cared to have another try	at politics; and his experience, his enlarged humanitarianism, and his maturing	wisdom all qualified him for a larger field of usefulness in public service.	But his once compelling political ambition seemed to have simmered out. Two	years before, When friends tried to induce him to run again for the state	legislature, he had declared that his profession demanded all his time. A move	to make him governor died from his own lack of interest. During the	presidential campaign of 1854, when the Whigs again nominated a military hero,	General Winfield Scott, he had served as a national committeeman and delivered	a few speeches. But they flashed little of the old fire. Looking back later on	this period of his life, he stated that "by 1854 his profession had almost	superseded the thought of politics in his mind."<p>		<p>		<p>		<font size=4><b>4.</font></b><p>		<p>		Lincoln might have lost interest entirely except for what was taking place in	Washington. But the news from the nation's capital carried portentous overtones	as Stephen A. Douglas, Lincoln's rival of bygone political contests, now a	United States Senator and chairman of the powerful committee on territories,	fostered a policy which, as Lincoln saw it, threatened the very ideals the	nation stood for.<p>		<p>		<p>		Early in January, Douglas had reported out of his committee a bill to organize	the territory of Nebraska with the stipulation that the people living there	might admit or exclude slavery as they chose--a provision contrary to that	clause of the Missouri Compromise which prohibited slavery in all the area of	the Louisiana Purchase north of Missouri and the western extension of its	southern boundary. Political maneuvering sent the bill back to committee; but	Douglas speedily reported it out again, this time in a form which divided the	affected area into two territories, Kansas and Nebraska, and expressly repealed	the slavery interdiction of the Missouri Compromise. The storm of protest that	broke in Congress spread rapidly through the North. Douglas was able to make	his principle of "popular sovereignty" the new Democratic faith, however, and	on March 3, after weeks of heated argument, he had jammed the measure through	the Senate.<p>		<p>		<p>		With that the battle shifted to the House of Representatives, and now, as	Lincoln made his way from one county town to another, he conned the newspapers	with more than his usual thoroughness. By the time he reached the town of	Lincoln he could read of protest meetings all over northern Illinois. At	Bloomington he learned that Richard Yates, Whig congressman from his district,	had spoken out against "the opening of this dangerous agitation, fraught with	such imminent peril to the existence of the Union itself." His home town Whig	paper, the Illinois State Journal, which came to Bloomington by train, was	condemning "the violation of the plighted faith and compacts of the nation."<p>		<p>		<p>		Newspapers available to Lincoln at Metamora predicted that Douglas's policy	would "lead to interminable broils." At Pekin, papers from near-by Peoria told	of Illinois congressmen Jesse Norton and Elihu Washburne joining Yates in	denouncing "this great wrong," of Chicago and New England clergymen petitioning	Congress to defeat the measure, and of veteran Senator Thomas Hart Benton of	Missouri, now a member of the House, lashing out at popular sovereignty as "a	bone given to the people to quarrel and fight over at every election and at	every meeting of the legislature until they become a state government." The	Missouri Compromise was intended to be perpetual, Benton had declared; it was	as sacred and inviolable as a human instrument can be. He recalled Douglas's	own assertion of less than four years before, that the Missouri Compromise had	"become canonized in the hearts of the American people as a sacred thing, which	no ruthless hand would ever be reckless enough to disturb."<p>		<p>		<p>		By the time Lincoln reached Clinton, the administration organs, rallying behind	Douglas's bill, were pursuing Benton in full cry. Fist swinging had been	narrowly averted in the House of Representatives. Papers throughout central	Illinois were condemning Douglas as a more dangerous fomenter of national	strife and hatred than the detested abolitionists. As feeling mounted to this	frenzied pitch, Lincoln's fellow lawyers noticed that he kept more and more to	himself. Often he was still awake when all the others went to bed. Rising early	in the morning, they sometimes found him sitting hunched in thought, staring at	the dead embers in the bedroom fireplace.<p>		<p>		<p>		For as long as Lincoln could remember he had reasoned, "If slavery is not	wrong, nothing is wrong." Yet, recognizing the virulence of slavery as a	political issue, he had been loath to touch it, believing, as he had declared	in the state legislature, that the promulgation of abolition doctrine tended to	increase rather than abate the evil of it. In this issue, as in so many others,	he had looked for wisdom to the Founding Fathers, and if he correctly	understood their attitude toward slavery, they had sought to restrict it to the	area where it had become engrafted, in the belief that, if so restricted, it	would die for lack of growth. So their policy became Lincoln's policy, too,	even though toleration of human bondage did violence to that concept of America	as the land of freedom and equality that he had cherished since boyhood. But	Douglas would risk opening new areas where slavery might feed anew, and thus	prolong its life. To Lincoln's mind this constituted a rejection of the policy	of ridding the nation of a hypocrisy at the earliest practicable time.<p>		<p>		<p>		It is not our concern here that Douglas looked at the matter from a drastically	different point of view, and regarded his policy as an application of the	principle of self-government which, by reason of climatic and economic factors,	would restrict slavery no less effectively than would a geographical line. The	important fact for us, and for history, is the energizing impact on Lincoln of	what seemed to him a repudiation of a national ideal. As he drove into Urbana,	far over toward the eastern border of Illinois, he felt oppressed and troubled;	for the struggle in the House of Representatives had reached the crisis stage.	May 23, the second day of the court term, became a fateful day for him. For	sometime during that day the telegraph chattered out the news he had hoped	would never come: the House had passed the Kansas-Nebraska Bill by a majority	of thirteen votes. Where and when Lincoln received the news we do not know, but	we have his own assertion that "it aroused him as he had never been before."<p>		<p>		<p>		Three months later he was back in politics, campaigning for the state	legislature as a spokesman for the anti-Nebraska forces in Illinois, and his	real career had begun. Unknowingly, he had set his feet in the path to the	presidency. For Lincoln will emerge now as a man of vision, who speaks with a	new authority and a new eloquence born of moral earnestness. That little engine	of ambition will throb more urgently than ever, but hereafter its energy will	be directed to the advancement of a cause. And Lincoln's desire "of being truly	esteemed of my fellow men" will find fulfillment in the revitalization of the	ideals of human freedom and equality in the hearts of his countrymen.<p>		<p>		<p>		No less compelling than the sunburst which appeared to Saul of Tarsus on the	Damascus road was the seeming renunciation of the national aspiration to	genuine democracy in bringing Abraham Lincoln back into political life, and in	transforming an honest, capable, but essentially self-centered small-town	politician of self-developed but largely unsuspected talents into democracy's	foremost spokesman.<p>		<p>		<p>		In Lincoln's first major speech after re-entering politics, he pleaded: "Let us	re-adopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it the practices, and	policy, which harmonize with it....If we do this we shall not only have saved	the Union; but we shall have so saved it as to make it, and to keep it, forever	worthy of the saving. We shall have so saved it, that the succeeding millions	of free happy people, the world over, shall rise up, and call us blessed, to	the latest generations."<p>		<p>		<p>		This was the theme that Lincoln stressed in his great debates with Douglas four	years later, and in his speech at Cooper Union early in 1860. And when war came	and he found himself in the very vortex of it, he explained in his first	message to Congress: "This is essentially a people's contest. On the side of	the Union it is a struggle for maintaining in the world that form and substance	of government whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men--to lift	artificial weights from all shoulders; to clear the paths of laudable pursuit	for all; to afford all an unfettered start, and a fair chance in the race of	life."<p>		<p>		<p>		Throughout the war, in state papers, in conversations, in private letters, in	informal talks to soldiers, he restated this idea in variant words. Identifying	the fate of the Union with the fate of world democracy, he defined the cause of	the nation in terms of human betterment throughout the world.<p>		<p>		<p>		When Lincoln was asked to make "a few appropriate remarks" at the dedication of	the soldiers' cemetery on the battlefield at Gettysburg, it was inevitable that	his thoughts should go back to the Founding Fathers, then forward, into the far	reach of time, and that he should plead for increased devotion to the ideals	the nation's sons were dying for, so that government of the people, by the	people, for the people might not perish from the earth.<p>		<p>		<p>		A nearer realization of the American dream became the aim of Lincoln's life.	Yet he was no mere dreamer. He realized that the struggle for human freedom is	eternal; he had no illusions of its ending in his lifetime or in ours. He	understood that the antagonisms between man's better nature and his selfishness	endure, and that it would be the fate of every generation of Americans to	defend democracy from its enemies of greed, intolerance, and despotism.<p>		<p></blockquote><p><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../index.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1954 by Benjamin P.

	<font size=5>T</font>he federal census for 1990 confirms something that some of us had suspected:
families with school-aged children make up a surprisingly small percentage of
the U.S. population.<p>

<p>

In 1950, five years after the end of the Second World War, 46.3 percent of
American households had children under eighteen. Ten years later the historic
Baby Boom was at full crest, and families with children were a remarkable 48.4
percent of all American households, just short of a majority.<p>

<p>

But then by 1970 the proportion of households with children was down to 44
percent, and in 1980 it was down to 37.5 percent. In 1990, after a full decade
in which Baby Boomers had had babies themselves, and were joined in the
endeavor by record numbers of new immigrants of childbearing age, the
proportion was down again, to 34.6 percent. Elementary school enrollments have
begun picking up during the past few years, but in most parts of the country
they will not achieve the peak numbers of the past.<p>

<p>

It's in the old industrial states of the Northeast and the Midwest that the new
demographics are most apparent. In New York, households with children were 44.5
percent of the total in 1960, 41.2 percent in 1970, 35.2 percent in 1980, and
31.1 percent in 1990. The figures for Massachusetts were 46.4 percent, 42.4
percent, 35.1 percent, and 32.3 percent; for Illinois 46.3 percent, 43.4
percent, 37.4 percent, and 33.4 percent; and for Michigan 51.4 percent,47.6
percent, 37.7 percent, and 34.9 percent.<p>

<p>

Surprisingly, the Sun Belt states do not rack up the countervailing numbers
that the popular impression might suggest. These places are seeing the
migration of young people from other parts of the country and immigration from
Asia and Latin America--but they also attract senior citizens. The net result:
large overall declines in the proportion of young families from 1960 to 1970
and from 1970 to 1980, with only minor rebounds from 1980 to 1990.<p>

<p>

Numbers like these are not rigidly predictive, but they provide a way of
thinking about the downward-tending fortunes of public education in many
communities. Heads of households with children under eighteen are, after all,
the core constituency for education in this country--not because they are more
enlightened or civic-minded than anybody else but precisely because they are
like everybody else: they think first about their own welfare and that of their
immediate families. When they vote or meet with or talk to their neighbors,
they are likely to have the schools in mind. And when their numbers begin to
decline substantially, the schools will likely suffer.<p>

<p>

The baby dearth has hit the schools of the American suburb hard. The very
community that was such a good place to raise a family in the 1960s is the most
likely to have a large complement of empty-nesters in the 1990s, many of whom
will be less interested in the schools than they once were.<p>

<p>

The district I represent in the Massachusetts state senate includes Belmont, a
middle-class and upper-middle-class suburb of 24,720. Belmont is a wonderful
town, home to many people, once blue-collar, who have moved out over the years
from the urban environs of Cambridge and Boston, and to others who hail from
around the country and have been drawn to professional opportunities in the
nearby cities or along the Route 128 technology belt.<p>

<p>

Belmont takes great pride in both the reputation and the appearance of its
gracefully landscaped high school, complete with duck pond, which lies near the
town center. More than 90 percent of the school's juniors and seniors take the
SATs, the average combined verbal and mathematics score is over a thousand, and
87 percent of the graduating class at least begin a four-year college
education.<p>

<p>

But the Belmont schools are caught in the demographic squeeze. In 1960, the
postwar influx having supplied a stream of young settlers, 42.0 percent of the
households had children under eighteen. Ten years later the figure had declined
to 35.7 percent. It was down to 28.7 percent by 1980 and 26.4 percent by 1990.
Outside observers would hardly call Belmont a retirement community, yet
sometime around 1975 it reached a watershed for an American town: the
proportion of its households containing people over sixty-five exceeded the
proportion of its households with children under eighteen.<p>

<p>

The effects of such a demographic squeeze are manifested subtly, and only over
time. In the twelve years that have passed since Proposition 2 1/2, the
Massachusetts property-tax limitation law, took effect, Belmont town meeting
has never placed a proposal on the ballot to exempt the operating budget of the
schools from the tax cap. Such a proposal, termed an override, would require
the approval of the townspeople in an open election, and the risk of rejection
has always seemed too high.<p>

<p>

As fiscal year 1991 approached, and Belmont town finances began to be very
tight, it was deemed the wiser course to mount an override campaign on the more
unifying issue of funding trash collection, in the knowledge that an exemption
for trash would have the effect of freeing up money for the schools. Even this
question passed by a scant 439 votes out of 5,585 votes cast, after an arduous
effort by proponents of town services. "We'll never do it again," a member of
the League of Women Voters told me with a groan.<p>

<p>

Belmont is a healthy, thriving place, and it may well be that the citizenry
will rally behind its tradition of fine education. But the going will be tough,
because the problem remains: in cities and towns across the country a
demographic bulge once operated to keep the schools at the center of community
life, and now it is gone. Today the presence of kids in every other house on
the street is something out of the past, and the parents of schoolchildren,
middle-class and poor alike, are the country's newest minority group. At a
historic moment when the schools need to be better than ever, they are instead
treading water, even slipping back a bit, and by world standards genuine
excellence is a long way off.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

One has to wonder, then: Will communities like Belmont, composed of growing
proportions of nonparents and empty nesters--people more likely to insist on
quality health care than on quality education--continue to support their
schools? To put the matter simply, will the votes be there? And if they are
not, what does American democracy do then?<p>

<p>

There is an answer, one as old as the republic. In 1787, as the people of the
liberated colonies wrestled with the question of a Constitution for their new
country James Madison wrote "The Advantages of Union," the famous Federalist
Paper in which he proposed to control the effects of faction and the resulting
risk to individuals of mistreatment by local majorities. His recourse was the
intelligent design of government. Madison wrote,<p>

<p>

"The smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller
the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and
execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater
variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of
the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other
citizens...."<p>

<p>

Applying Madison's idea to education by extending state and national
responsibility for the protection of parental minorities might be expected to
stir up a fuss. There is, after all, a long-standing tradition of local control
over the schools. But no one means to abolish the local function; balance is
the issue here--an artful recalibration of roles among the local, state, and
national spheres of American democracy. The vexing question of school finance
cries out for Madisonian thinking. As a modest step toward escaping the tyranny
of local majorities, federal funding for public education should be returned
over time to the level at which it was in 1980--9.8 percent of school
expenditures. This would amount to about $23 billion a year: a good start to
reinvigorating the federal role, especially if the commitment spurred matching
efforts on the part of the states.<p>

<p>

As sensibly Madisonian as it may be, increasing federal spending on education
is not the only option. Why not a federalism swap? If Washington were to divide
its savings from defense cuts and other sources into essentially three
accounts, deficit reduction, economic stimulus, and health care, and adopt a
funding schedule for the third which picked up the state and local portions of
Medicaid as part of a national health insurance scheme, the other tiers of
government would have more than enough money to fund education
reform--including special aid to poor districts--on their own. This would
neatly apportion responsibility: health-care finance at the federal level,
school finance at the state and local levels.<p>

<p>

The deepening political isolation of families with children imperils the aims
of excellence and equity both. A Madisonian solution, its roots deep in the
soil of traditional American thinking, offers us a way out. The Clinton
Administration and Congress should take it.

I'm editing a special issue of the school ofeducation journal on standards. <p><p><b>How did this article come about?</b><p><b></b><p>This article came out of my research and my experience as the director at theU.S. Department of Education in Washington, which funded the national standardsproject.<p><p><b>Are we in an education crisis right now?</b><p><b></b><p>Yes. I think that the standards strategy which is being used and has been usedby foreign systems gives us a chance--whether we apply it on a nation scale ora state scale--to bring an equal curriculum to kids. I was particularlyconcerned and still am that not enough people understand how the strategy issupposed to work and how it works in other countries so that we don't lose thechance to bring some equity into the schools. Since the founding of theRepublic, the academic curriculum has been for the minority and this is ademocratic system. I think that what the standards strategy is supposed to dois lay out common and high academic expectations and leave how you reach themto the local and state schools.<p><p><b>What countries have employed this strategy well?</b><p><b></b><p>Japan, France, Denmark, Holland, Germany, Belgium. The European countriesimposed standards after World War II. Since the French Revolution there hadbeen people who demanded equal schooling for all kids regardless of what theywere expected to do with their life--to prepare them as people and as citizens.They've been arguing it for a long time. For the most part, the high schools inWestern Europe were open to all kids and made obligatory only after W.W.II, butas they were being opened the political parties insisted that it be the samecurriculum for all. In other words children of the lower classes would be giventhe same chances in schools. Whereas when we opened our high schools in the1920s and 1930s, we tracked students from the start; academics were reallyreserved for the top 15-20%. And that was the case pretty much through the1980s. It is only with the publication of <i>A Nation at Risk</i> in 1983 thatthe standards movement started. It has been vigorously opposed by people whosay, all these poor kids, minorities, and immigrants will drop out if you givethem an academic core. Teaching poorer kids an academic core exposes to whatthe humanities and the social sciences can offer to people's lives. Close tohalf of the kids who are graduating in France today are graduating frompre-technical high schools, but their core curriculum is liberal arts and tothat core they add other technical and vocational stuff. They don't cut thecore out of this.<p><p><b>Is there a problem with funding for schools?</b><p><b></b><p>The resources that have been given to schools have been so uneven for so long.Some schools are really starved. My argument is that this is harder to do incountries where the standards are equal for all kids. I think the issue offunding and support will depend on adopting common and high academic standards.<p><p><b>What do think of the push to make English a national language in theU.S.?</b><p><b></b><p>I think it is beside the point. I think there is a problem in some schooldistricts in which the bilingual programs have become a lobby and vestedinterest and often keep kids in those programs longer than they have to be. Butpolls taken by the American Federation of Teachers in New York and other statesshow that the parents are determined that their kids should learn English. Ithink it will happen and common standards in English will help it happen. <p><p><b>What do think of The Atlantic's tradition in publishing on education?</b><p><b></b><p>Well, I think it's been helpfully eclectic. It's been open to all strains. I'mconcerned mainly that people get a clear view of what the standards strategyis. How it connects to school spending and school experiments. How it works inother places and it's really not a mysterious thing at all. I think theeducation industry thrives on making things seem more complicated than theyare. <p><p><p><p><i>Interview by Marty Hergert</i><p>	</blockquote><hr><pre></pre><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a><a href="../contents.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-toc.gif" width=72 height=23 border=0 alt="Contents"></a><a href="http://vws.agtnet.com/atl_find.html"><img src="../../../images/bt-find.gif" width=61 height=23 border=0 alt="Search"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; (1995) by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

<blockquote>
	
	<font size=5>F</font>ew events in American literary history have been more curious than the sudden
rise of Emily Dickinson into a posthumous fame only more accentuated by the
utterly recluse character of her life and by her aversion to even a literary
publicity. The lines which form a prelude to the published volume of her poems
are the only ones that have come to light indicating even a temporary desire to
come in contact with the great world of readers; she seems to have had no
reference, in all the rest, to anything but her own thought and a few friends.
But for her only sister it is very doubtful if her poems would ever have been
printed at all; and when published, they were launched quietly and without any
expectation of a wide audience; yet the outcome of it is that six editions of
the volume have been sold within six months, a suddenness of success almost
without a parallel in American literature.<p>

<p>

One result of this glare of publicity has been a constant and earnest demand by
her readers for further information in regard to her; and I have decided with
much reluctance to give some extracts from her early correspondence with one
whom she always persisted in regarding--with very little ground for it--as a
literary counselor and confidant.<p>

<p>

It seems to be the opinion of those who have examined her accessible
correspondence most widely, that no other letters bring us quite so intimately
near to the peculiar quality and aroma of her nature; and it has been urged
upon me very strongly that her readers have the right to know something more of
this gifted and most interesting woman.<p>

<p>

On April 16, 1862, I took from the post office in Worcester, Mass., where I was
then living, the following letter:--<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
MR. HIGGINSON,--Are you too deeply occupied to say if my verse is alive?<p>

The mind is so near itself it cannot see distinctly, and I have none to 
ask.<p>

Should you think it breathed, and had you the leisure to tell me, I should feel
quick gratitude.<p>

If I make the mistake, that you dared to tell me would give me sincerer honor
toward you.<p>

I inclose my name, asking you, if you please, sir, to tell me what is 
true?<p>

That you will not betray me it is needless to ask, since honor is its own
pawn.<p></blockquote>

The letter was postmarked "Amherst," and it was in a handwriting so peculiar
that it seemed as if the writer might have taken her first lessons by studying
the famous fossil bird-tracks in the museum of that college town. Yet it was
not in the slightest degree illiterate, but cultivated, quaint, and wholly
unique. Of punctuation there was little; she used chiefly dashes, and it has
been thought better, in printing these letters, as with her poems, to give them
the benefit in this respect of the ordinary usages; and so with her habit as to
capitalization, as the printers call it, in which she followed the Old English
and present German method of thus distinguishing every noun substantive. But
the most curious thing about the letter was the total absence of a signature.
It proved, however, that she had written her name on a card, and put it under
the shelter of a smaller envelope inclosed in the larger; and even this name
was written--as if the shy writer wished to recede as far as possible from
view--in pencil, not in ink. The name was Emily Dickinson. Inclosed with the
letter were four poems, two of which have been already printed,--"Safe in their
alabaster chambers" and "I'll tell you how the sun rose," together with the two
that here follow. The first comprises in its eight lines a truth so searching
that it seems a condensed summary of the whole experience of a long life:--

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre>We play at paste 
Till qualified for pearl;
Then drop the paste
And deem ourself a fool.

The shapes, though, were similar
And our new hands
Learned gem-tactics,
Practicing sands.
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

Then came one which I have always classed among the most exquisite of her
productions, with a singular felicity of phrase and an aerial lift that bears
the ear upward with the bee it traces:--

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre>The nearest dream recedes unrealized.
     The heaven we chase,
     Like the June bee
     Before the schoolboy,
     Invites the race,
     Stoops to an easy clover,
Dips--evades--teases--deploys--
Then to the royal clouds
     Lifts his light pinnace,
     Heedless of the boy
Staring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.

     Homesick for steadfast honey,--
     Ah! the bee flies not
Which brews that rare variety.
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>


The impression of a wholly new and original poetic genius was as distinct on my
mind at the first reading of these four poems as it is now, after thirty years
of further knowledge; and with it came the problem never yet solved, what place
ought to be assigned in literature to what is so remarkable, yet so elusive of
criticism. The bee himself did not evade the schoolboy more than she evaded me;
and even at this day I still stand somewhat bewildered, like the boy.<p>

<p>

Circumstances, however, soon brought me in contact with an uncle of Emily
Dickinson, a gentleman not now living; a prominent citizen of Worcester, a man
of integrity and character, who shared her abruptness and impulsiveness but
certainly not her poetic temperament, from which he was indeed singularly
remote. He could tell but little of her, she being evidently an enigma to him,
as to me. It is hard to tell what answer was made by me, under these
circumstances, to this letter. It is probable that the adviser sought to gain
time a little and find out with what strange creature he was dealing. I
remember to have ventured on some criticism which she afterwards called
"surgery," and on some questions, part of which she evaded, as will be seen,
with a naive skill such as the most experienced and worldly coquette might
envy. Her second letter (received April 26, 1862), was as follows:--<p>

<blockquote>
MR. HIGGINSON,--Your kindness claimed earlier gratitude, but I was ill, and
write to-day from my pillow.<p>

Thank you for the surgery; it was not so painful as I supposed. I bring you
others, as you ask, though they might not differ. While my thought is
undressed, I can make the distinction; but when I put them in the gown, they
look alike and numb.<p>

You asked how old I was? I made no verse, but one or two, until this winter,
sir.<p>

I had a terror since September, I could tell to none; and so I sing, as the boy
does of the burying ground, because I am afraid.<p>

You inquire my books. For poets, I have Keats, and Mr. and Mrs. Browning. For
prose, Mr. Ruskin, Sir Thomas Browne, and the Revelations. I went to school,
but in your manner of the phrase had no education. When a little girl, I had a
friend who taught me Immortality; but venturing too near, himself, he never
returned. Soon after my tutor died, and for several years my lexicon was my
only companion. Then I found one more, but he was not contented I be his
scholar, so he left the land.<p>

You ask of my companions. Hills, sir, and the sundown, and a dog large as
myself, that my father bought me. They are better than beings because they
know, but do not tell; and the noise in the pool at noon excels my 
piano.<p>

I have a brother and sister; my mother does not care for thought, and father,
too busy with his briefs to notice what we do. He buys me many books, but begs
me not to read them, because he fears they joggle the mind. They are religious,
except me, and address an eclipse, every morning, whom they call their
"Father."<p>

But I fear my story fatigues you. I would like to learn. Could you tell me how
to grow, or is it unconveyed, like melody or witchcraft?<p>

You speak of Mr. Whitman. I never read his book, but was told that it was
disgraceful.<p>

I read Miss Prescott's Circumstance, but it followed me in the dark, so I
avoided her.<p>

Two editors of journals came to my father's house this winter, and asked me for
my mind, and when I asked them "why" they said I was penurious, and they would
use it for the world.<p>

I could not weigh myself, myself. My size felt small to me. I read your
chapters in the Atlantic, and experienced honor for you. I was sure you would
not reject a confiding question.<p>

Is this, sir, what you asked me to tell you? Your friend,<p>

E. DICKINSON.</blockquote>

It will be seen that she had now drawn a step nearer, signing her name, and as
my "friend." It will also be noticed that I had sounded her about certain
American authors, then much read; and that she knew how to put her own
criticisms in a very trenchant way. With this letter came some more verses,
still in the same birdlike script, as for instance the following:--

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre>Your riches taught me poverty,
     Myself a millionaire
In little wealths, as girls could boast,
     Till, broad as Buenos Ayre,
You drifted your dominions
     A different Peru,
And I esteemed all poverty
     For life's estate, with you.

Of mines, I little know, myself, 
     But just the names of gems,
The colors of the commonest,
     And scarce of diadems
So much that, did I meet the queen
     Her glory I should know;
But this must be a different wealth,
     To miss it, beggars so.

I'm sure 't is India, all day,
     To those who look on you
Without a stint, without a blame,
     Might I but be the Jew!
I'm sure it is Golconda
     Beyond my power to deem,
To have a smile for mine, each day,
     How better than a gem!

At least, it solaces to know
     That there exists a gold
Although I prove it just in time
     Its distance to behold;
Its far, far treasure to surmise
     And estimate the pearl
That slipped my simple fingers through
     While just a girl at school!
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

Here was already manifest that defiance of form, never through carelessness,
and never precisely from whim, which so marked her. The slightest change in the
order of word--thus, "While yet at school, a girl"--would have given her a
rhyme for this last line; but no; she was intent upon her thought, and it would
not have satisfied her to make the change. The other poem further showed, what
had already been visible, a rare and delicate sympathy with the life of
nature:--

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre>A bird came down the walk; 
He did not know I saw;
He bit an angle-worm in halves
And ate the fellow raw.

And then he drank a dew
From a convenient grass,
And then hopped sidewise to a wall,
To let a beetle pass.

He glanced with rapid eyes
That hurried all around; 
They looked like frightened beads, I thought;
He stirred his velvet head

Like one in danger; cautious.
I offered him a crumb,
And he unrolled his feathers
And rowed him softer home

Than oars divide the ocean,
Too silver for a seam--
Or butterflies, off banks of noon,
Leap, plashless as they swim.
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>


It is possible that in a second letter I gave more of distinct praise or
encouragement, for her third is in a different mood. This was received June 8,
1862. There is something startling in its opening image; and in the yet
stranger phrase that follows, where she apparently uses "mob" in the sense of
chaos or bewilderment:--<p>

<blockquote>
DEAR FRIEND,--Your letter gave no drunkenness, because I tasted rum before.
Domingo comes but once; yet I have had few pleasures so deep as your opinion,
and if I tried to thank you, my tears would block my tongue.<p>

My dying tutor told me that he would like to live till I had been a poet, but
Death was much of mob as I could master, then. And when, far afterward, a
sudden light on orchards, or a new fashion in the wind troubled my attention, I
felt a palsy, here, the verses just relieve.<p>

Your second letter surprised me, and for a moment, swung. I had not supposed
it. Your first gave no dishonor, because the true are not ashamed. I thanked
you for your justice, but could not drip the bells whose jingling cooled my
tramp. Perhaps the balm seemed better, because you bled me first. I smile when
you suggest that I delay "to publish," that being foreign to my thought as
firmament to fin.<p>

If fame belonged to me, I could not escape her; if she did not, the longest day
would pass me on the chase, and the approbation of my dog would forsake me
then. My barefoot rank is better.<p>

You think my gait "spasmodic." I am in danger, sir. You think me
"uncontrolled." I have no tribunal.<p>

Would you have time to be the "friend" you should think I need? I have a little
shape: it would not crowd your desk, nor make much racket as the mouse that
dents your galleries. <p>

If I might bring you what I do--not so frequent to trouble you--and ask you if
I told it clear, 't would be control to me. The sailor cannot see the North,
but knows the needle can. The "hand you stretch me in the dark" I put mine in,
and turn away. I have no Saxon now:--

<blockquote>
<pre>As if I asked a common alms,
And in my wondering hand
A stranger pressed a kingdom,
And I, bewildered, stand;
As if I asked the Orient
Had it for me a morn,
And it should lift its purple dikes
And shatter me with dawn!
</pre>
</blockquote>

But, will you be my preceptor, Mr. Higginson?</blockquote>

With this came the poem already published in her volume and entitled
Renunciation; and also that beginning "Of all the sounds dispatched abroad,"
thus fixing approximately the date of those two. I must soon have written to
ask her for her picture, that I might form some impression of my enigmatical
correspondent. To this came the following reply, in July, 1862:--

<p>
<blockquote>
Could you believe me without? I had no portrait, now, but am small, like the
wren; and my hair is bold, like the chestnut bur; and my eyes, like the sherry
in the glass, that the guest leaves. Would this do just as well?<p>

<p>

It often alarms father. He says death might occur, and he has moulds of all the
rest, but has no mould of me; but I noticed the quick wore off those things, in
a few days, and forestall the dishonor. You will think no caprice of me.<p>

<p>

You said "Dark." I know the butterfly, and the lizard, and the orchis. Are not
those your countrymen?<p>

<p>

I am happy to be your scholar, and will deserve the kindness I cannot repay.<p>

<p>

If you truly consent, I recite now. Will you tell me my fault, frankly as to
yourself, for I had rather wince than die. Men do not call the surgeon to
commend the bone, but to set it, sir, and fracture within is more critical. And
for this, preceptor, I shall bring you obedience, the blossom from my garden,
and every gratitude I know.<p>

<p>

Perhaps you smile at me. I could not stop for that. My business is
circumference. An ignorance, not of customs, but if caught with the dawn, or
the sunset see me, myself the only kangaroo among the beauty, sir, if you
please, it afflicts me, and I thought that instruction would take it away.<p>

<p>

Because you have much business, beside the growth of me, you will appoint,
yourself, how often I shall come, without your inconvenience.<p>

<p>

And if at any time you regret you received me, or I prove a different fabric to
that you supposed, you must banish me.<p>

<p>

When I state myself, as the representative of the verse, it does not mean me,
but a supposed person.<p>

<p>

You are true about the "perfection." To-day makes Yesterday mean.<p>

<p>

You spoke of Pippa Passes. I never heard anybody speak of Pippa Passes before.
You see my posture is benighted.<p>

<p>

To thank you baffles me. Are you perfectly powerful? Had I a pleasure you had
not, I could delight to bring it.<p>

<p>

YOUR SCHOLAR.</blockquote>

<p>

This was accompanied by this strong poem, with its breathless conclusion. The
title is of my own giving:--

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre>THE SAINTS' REST.

Of tribulation, these are they,
     Denoted by the white;
The spangled gowns, a lesser rank
     Of victors designate.

All these did conquer; but the ones
     Who overcame most times,
Wear nothing commoner than snow,
     No ornaments but palms.

"Surrender" is a sort unknown
     On this superior soil;
"Defeat" an outgrown anguish,
     Remembered as the mile

Our panting ancle barely passed
     When night devoured the road;
But we stood whispering in the house,
     And all we said, was "Saved!"
</pre>
</blockquote>

[Note by the writer of the verses.] I spelled ankle wrong.
</blockquote>

<p>

It would seem that at first I tried a little,--a very little--to lead her in
the direction of rules and traditions; but I fear it was only perfunctory, and
that she interested me more in her--so to speak--unregenerate condition. Still,
she recognizes the endeavor. In this case, as will be seen, I called her
attention to the fact that while she took pains to correct the spelling of a
word, she was utterly careless of greater irregularities. It will be seen by
her answer that with her usual naive adroitness she turns my point:--<p>

<blockquote>

DEAR FRIEND,--Are these more orderly? I thank you for the truth.<p>

<p>

I had no monarch in my life, and cannot rule myself; and when I try to
organize, my little force explodes and leaves me bare and charred.<p>

<p>

I think you called me "wayward." Will you help me improve?<p>

<p>

I suppose the pride that stops the breath, in the core of woods, is not of
ourself.<p>

<p>

You say I confess the little mistake, and omit the large. Because I can see
orthography; but the ignorance out of sight is my preceptor's charge.<p>

<p>

Of "shunning men and women," they talk of hallowed things, aloud, and embarrass
my dog. He and I don't object to them, if they'll exist their side. I think
Carl would please you. He is dumb, and brave. I think you would like the
chestnut tree I met in my walk. It hit my notice suddenly, and I thought the
skies were in blossom.<p>

<p>

Then there's a noiseless noise in the orchard that I let persons hear.<p>

<p>

You told me in one letter you could not come to see me "now," and I made no
answer; not because I had none, but did not think myself the price that you
should come so far.<p>

<p>

I do not ask so large a pleasure, lest you might deny me. <p>

<p>

You say, "Beyond your knowledge." You would not jest with me, because I believe
you; but, preceptor, you cannot mean it?<p>

<p>

All men say "What" to me, but I thought it a fashion.<p>

<p>

When much in the woods, as a little girl, I was told that the snake would bite
me, that I might pick a poisonous flower, or goblins kidnap me; but I went
along and met no one but angels, who were far shyer of me than I could be of
them, so I have n't that confidence in fraud which many exercise.<p>

<p>

I shall observe your precept, though I don't understand, always.<p>

<p>

I marked a line in one verse, because I met it after I made it, and never
consciously touch a paint mixed by another person.<p>

<p>

I did not let go it, because it is mine. Have you the portrait of Mrs.
Browning?<p>

<p>

Persons sent me three. If you had none, will you have mine?<p>

<p>

YOUR SCHOLAR.</blockquote>

<p>

A month or two after this I entered the volunteer army of the civil war, and
must have written to her during the winter of 1862-3 from South Carolina or
Florida, for the following reached me in camp:--<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
AMHERST<p>

<p>

DEAR FRIEND,--I did not deem that planetary forces annulled, but suffered an
exchange of territory, or world. <p>

<p>

I should have liked to see you before you became improbable. War feels to me an
oblique place. Should there be other summers, would you perhaps come?<p>

<p>

I found you were gone, by accident, as I find systems are, or seasons of the
year, and obtain no cause, but suppose it a treason of progress that dissolves
as it goes. Carlo still remained, and I told him

<blockquote>
<pre>Best gains must have the losses' test,
To constitute them gains.
</pre>
</blockquote>

My shaggy ally assented.<p>

<p>

Perhaps death gave me awe for friends, striking sharp and early, for I held
them since in a brittle love, of more alarm than peace. I trust you may pass
the limit of war; and though not reared to prayer, when service is had in
church for our arms, I include yourself. . . . I was thinking to-day, as I
noticed, that the "Supernatural" was only the Natural disclosed.

<blockquote>
<pre>Not "Revelation" 't is that waits,
But our unfurnished eyes.
</pre>
</blockquote>

But I fear I detain you. Should you, before this reaches you, experience
immortality, who will inform me of the exchange? Could you, with honor, avoid
death, I entreat you sir. It would bereave <br>YOUR GNOME.<p>

<p>

I trust the "Procession of Flowers" was not a premonition.<p>

</blockquote>

I cannot explain this extraordinary signature, substituted for the now
customary "Your Scholar," unless she imagined her friend to be in some
incredible and remote condition, imparting its strangeness to her. Mr. Howells
reminds me that Swedenborg somewhere has an image akin to her "oblique place,"
where he symbolizes evil as simply an oblique angle. With this letter came
verses, most refreshing in that clime of jasmines and mocking-birds, on the
familiar robin:--

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre>THE ROBIN.

The robin is the one
That interrupts the morn
With hurried, few, express reports
When March is scarcely on.

The robin is the one
That overflows the noon
With her cherubic quantity,
An April but begun.

The robin is the one
That, speechless from her nest,
Submits that home and certainty
And sanctity are best.
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

In the summer of 1863 I was wounded, and in hospital for a time, during which
came this letter in pencil, written from what was practically a hospital for
her, though only for weak eyes:--<p>

<blockquote>

DEAR FRIEND,--Are you in danger? I did not know that you were hurt. Will you
tell me more? Mr. Hawthorne died.<p>

<p>

I was ill since September, and since April in Boston for a physician's care. He
does not let me go, yet I work in my prison, and make guests for myself.<p>

<p>

Carlo did not come, because that he would die in jail; and the mountains I
could not hold now, so I brought but the Gods.<p>

<p>

I wish to see you more than before I failed. Will you tell me your health? I am
surprised and anxious since receiving your note.

<blockquote>
<pre>The only news I know
Is bulletins all day
From Immortality.
</pre>
</blockquote>


Can you render my pencil? The physician has taken away my pen.<p>

<p>

I inclose the address from a letter, lest my figures fail.<p>

<p>

Knowledge of your recovery would excel my own.<p>     
E. DICKINSON.<p>
</blockquote>
<p>

Later this arrived:--<p>

<blockquote>

DEAR FRIEND,--I think of you so wholly that I cannot resist to write again, to
ask if you are safe? Danger is not at first, for then we are unconscious, but
in the after, slower days.<p>

<p>

Do not try to be saved, but let redemption find you, as it certainly will. Love
is its own rescue; for we, at our supremest, are but its trembling 
emblems.<p>
YOUR SCHOLAR.<p>

</blockquote>

These were my earliest letters from Emily Dickinson, in their order. From this
time and up to her death (May 15, 1886) we corresponded at varying intervals,
she always persistently keeping up this attitude of "Scholar," and assuming on
my part a preceptorship which it is almost needless to say did not exist.
Always glad to hear her "recite," as she called it , I soon abandoned all
attempt to guide in the slightest degree this extraordinary nature, and simply
accepted her confidences, giving as much as I could of what might interest her
in return.<p>

<p>

Sometimes there would be a long pause, on my part, after which would come a
plaintive letter, always terse, like this:--<p>

<blockquote>

"Did I displease you? But won't you tell me how?"</blockquote>

<p>

Or perhaps the announcement of some event, vast to her small sphere, as this:<p>

<blockquote>

AMHERST.<p>

<p>

Carlo died. <p>         E. DICKINSON.<p>



Would you instruct me now?<p>
</blockquote>
<p>

Or sometimes there would arrive an exquisite little detached strain, every word
a picture, like this:--

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre>THE HUMMING-BIRD.

A route of evanescence
With a revolving wheel;
A resonance of emerald;
A rush of cochineal.
And every blossom on her bush
Adjusts its tumbled head;--
The mail from Tunis, probably,
An easy morning's ride.
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

Nothing in literature, I am sure, so condenses into a few words that gorgeous
atom of life and fire of which she here attempts the description. It is,
however, needless to conceal that many of her brilliant fragments were less
satisfying. She almost always grasped whatever she sought, but with some
fracture of grammar and dictionary on the way. Often, too, she was obscure and
sometimes inscrutable; and though obscurity is sometimes, in Coleridge's
phrase, a compliment to the reader, yet it is never safe to press this
compliment too hard.<p>

Sometimes, on the other hand, her verses found too much favor for her comfort,
and she was urged to publish. In such cases I was sometimes put forward as a
defense; and the following letter was the fruit of some such occasion:--<p>

<blockquote>
DEAR FRIEND,--Thank you for the advice. I shall implicitly follow it.<p>

<p>

The one who asked me for the lines I had never seen.<p>

<p>

He spoke of "a charity." I refused, but did not inquire. He again earnestly
urged, on the ground that in that way I might "aid unfortunate children." The
name of "child" was a snare to me, and I hesitated, choosing my most
rudimentary, and without criterion.<p>

<p>

I inquired of you. You can scarcely estimate the opinion to one utterly
guideless. Again thank you.<p>

<p>

YOUR SCHOLAR.<p>

</blockquote>

Again came this, on a similar theme:<p>

<blockquote>

DEAR FRIEND,--Are you willing to tell me what is right? Mrs. Jackson, of
Colorado ["H.H.," her early schoolmate], was with me a few moments this week,
and wished me to write for this. [A circular of the "No Name Series" was
inclosed.] I told her I was unwilling, and she asked me why? I said I was
incapable, and she seemed not to believe me and asked me not to decide for a
few days. Meantime, she would write me. She was so sweetly noble, I would
regret to estrange her, and if you would be willing to give me a note saying
you disapproved it, and thought me unfit, she would believe you. I am sorry to
flee so often to my safest friend, but hope he permits me.<p>

</blockquote>

In all this time--nearly eight years--we had never met, but she had sent
invitations like the following:--<p>

<blockquote>

AMHERST.<p>

<p>

DEAR FRIEND,--Whom my dog understood could not elude others.<p>

<p>

I should be so glad to see you, but think it an apparitional pleasure, not to
be fulfilled. I am uncertain of Boston.<p>

<p>

I had promised to visit my physician for a few days in May, but father objects
because he is in the habit of me.<p>

<p>

Is it more far to Amherst?<p>

<p>

You will find a minute host, but a spacious welcome. . . . <p>

<p>

If I still entreat you to teach me, are you much displeased? I will be patient,
constant, never reject your knife, and should my slowness goad you, you knew
before myself that

<blockquote>
<pre>Except the smaller size
No lives are round.
These hurry to a sphere
And show and end.
The larger slower grow
And later hang;
The summers of Hesperides
Are long.
</pre>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
Afterwards, came this:--<p>

<blockquote>

AMHERST.<p>

<p>

DEAR FRIEND,--<p>

<p>

A letter always feels to me like immortality because it is the mind alone
without corporeal friend. Indebted in our talk to attitude and accent, there
seems a spectral power in thought that walks alone. I would like to thank you
for your great kindness, but never try to lift the words which I cannot hold.<p>

<p>

Should you come to Amherst, I might then succeed, though gratitude is the timid
wealth of those who have nothing. I am sure that you speak the truth, because
the noble do, but your letters always surprise me.<p>

<p>

My life has been too simple and stern to embarrass any. "Seen of Angels,"
scarcely my responsibility.<p>

<p>

It is difficult not to be fictitious in so fair a place, but tests' severe
repairs are permitted all.<p>

<p>

When a little girl I remember hearing that remarkable passage and preferring
the "Power," not knowing at the time that "Kingdom" and "Glory" were
included.<p>

<p>

You noticed my dwelling alone. To an emigrant, country is idle except it be his
own. You speak kindly of seeing me; could it please your convenience to come so
far as Amherst, I should be very glad, but I do not cross my father's ground to
any house or town.<p>

<p>

Of our greatest acts we are ignorant. You were not aware that you saved my
life. To thank you in person has been since then one of my few requests. . . .
You will excuse each that I say, because no one taught me.<p>

</blockquote>

At last, after many postponements, on August 16, 1870, I found myself face to
face with my hitherto unseen correspondent. It was at her father's house, one
of those large, square, brick mansions so familiar in our older New England
towns, surrounded by trees and blossoming shrubs without, and within
exquisitely neat, cool, spacious, and fragrant with flowers. After a little
delay, I heard an extremely faint and pattering footstep like that of a child,
in the hall, and in glided, almost noiselessly, a plain, shy little person, the
face without a single good feature, but with eyes, as she herself said, "like
the sherry the guest leaves in the glass," and with smooth bands of reddish
chestnut hair. She had a quaint and nun-like look, as if she might be a German
canoness of some religious order, whose prescribed garb was white pique, with a
blue net worsted shawl. She came toward me with two day-lilies, which she put
in a childlike way into my hand, saying softly, under her breath, "These are my
introduction," and adding, also, under her breath, in childlike fashion,
"Forgive me if I am frightened; I never see strangers, and hardly know what I
say." But soon she began to talk, and thenceforward continued almost
constantly; pausing sometimes to beg that I would talk instead, but readily
recommencing when I evaded. There was not a trace of affectation in all this;
she seemed to speak absolutely for her own relief, and wholly without watching
its effect on her hearer. Led on by me, she told much about her early life, in
which her father was always the chief figure,--evidently a man of the old type,
la vieille roche of Puritanism--a man who, as she said, read on Sunday "lonely
and rigorous books;" and who had from childhood inspired her with such awe,
that she never learned to tell time by the clock till she was fifteen, simply
because he had tried to explain it to her when she was a little child, and she
had been afraid to tell him that she did not understand, and also afraid to ask
any one else lest he should hear of it. Yet she had never heard him speak a
harsh word, and it needed only a glance at his photograph to see how truly the
Puritan tradition was preserved in him. He did not wish his children, when
little, to read anything but the Bible; and when, one day, her brother brought
her home Longfellow's Kavanagh, he put it secretly under the pianoforte cover,
made signs to her, and they both afterwards read it. It may have been before
this, however, that a student of her father's was amazed to find that she and
her brother had never heard of Lydia Maria Child, then much read, and he
brought Letters from New York, and hid it in the great bush of old-fashioned
tree-box beside the front door. After the first book she thought in ecstasy,
"This, then, is a book, and there are more of them." But she did not find so
many as she expected, for she afterwards said to me, "When I lost the use of my
eyes, it was a comfort to think that there were so few real books that I could
easily find one to read me all of them." Afterwards, when she regained her
eyes, she read Shakespeare, and thought to herself, "Why is any other book
needed?"<p>

<p>

She went on talking constantly and saying, in the midst of narrative, things
quaint and aphoristic. "Is it oblivion or absorption when things pass from our
minds?" "Truth is such a rare thing, it is delightful to tell it." "I find
ecstacy in living; the mere sense of living is joy enough." When I asked her if
she never felt any want of employment, not going off the grounds and rarely
seeing a visitor, she answered, "I never thought of conceiving that I could
ever have the slightest approach to such a want in all future time;" and then
added, after a pause, "I feel that I have not expressed myself strongly
enough," although it seemed to me that she had. She told me of her household
occupations, that she made all their bread, because her father liked only hers;
then saying shyly, "And people must have puddings," this very timidly and
suggestively, as if they were meteors or comets. Interspersed with these
confidences came phrases so emphasized as to seem the very wantonness of
over-statement, as if she pleased herself with putting into words what the most
extravagant might possibly think without saying, as thus: "How do most people
live without any thought? There are many people in the world,--you must have
noticed them in the street,--how do they live? How do they get strength to put
on their clothes in the morning?" Or this crowning extravaganza: "If I read a
book and it makes my whole body so cold no fire can ever warm me, I know that
is poetry. If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know
that is poetry. These are the only ways I know it. Is there any other way?"<p>

<p>

I have tried to describe her just as she was, with the aid of notes taken at
the time; but this interview left our relation very much what it was
before;--on my side an interest that was strong and even affectionate, but not
based on any thorough comprehension; and on her side a hope, always rather
baffled, that I should afford some aid in solving her abstruse problem of
life.<p>

<p>

The impression undoubtedly made on me was that of an excess of tension, and of
an abnormal life. Perhaps in time I could have got beyond that somewhat
overstrained relation which not my will, but her needs, had forced upon us.
Certainly I should have been most glad to bring it down to the level of simple
truth and every-day comradeship; but it was not altogether easy. She was much
too enigmatical a being for me to solve in an hour's interview, and an instinct
told me that the slightest attempt at direct cross-examination would make her
withdraw into her shell; I could only sit still and watch, as one does in the
woods; I must name my bird without a gun, as recommended by Emerson. Under this
necessity I had not opportunity to see that human and humorous side of her
which is strongly emphasized by her nearer friends, and which shows itself in
her quaint and unique description of a rural burglary, contained in the volume
of her poems. Hence, even her letters to me show her mainly on her exaltee
side; and should a volume of her correspondence ever be printed, it is very
desirable that it should contain some of her letters to friends of closer and
more familiar intimacy.<p>

<p>

After my visit came this letter:--<p>

<blockquote>

Enough is so vast a sweetness, I suppose it never occurs, only pathetic
counterfeits.<p>

<p>

Fabulous to me as the men of the Revelations who "shall not hunger any more."
Even the possible has its insoluble particle.<p>

<p>

After you went, I took Macbeth and turned to "Birnam Wood." Came twice "To
Dunsinane." I thought and went about my work. . . .<p>

<p>

The vein cannot thank the artery, but her solemn indebtedness to him, even the
stolidest admit, and so of me who try, whose effort leaves no sound.<p>

<p>

You ask great questions accidentally. To answer them would be events. I trust
that you are safe.<p>

<p>

I ask you to forgive me for all the ignorance I had. I find no nomination sweet
as your low opinion.<p>

<p>

Speak, if but to blame your obedient child.<p>

<p>

You told me of Mrs. Lowell's poems. Would you tell me where I could find them,
or are they not for sight? An article of yours, too, perhaps the only one you
wrote that I never knew. It was about a "Latch." Are you willing to tell me?
[Perhaps "A Sketch."]<p>

<p>

If I ask too much, you could please refuse. Shortness to live has made me
bold.<p>

<p>

Abroad is close to-night and I have but to lift my hands to touch the "Heights
of Abraham."<p>                     DICKINSON.<p>

</blockquote>

When I said, at parting, that I would come again sometime, she replied, "Say,
in a long time; that will be nearer. Some time is no time." We met only once
again, and I  have no express record of the visit. We corresponded for years,
at long intervals, her side of the intercourse being, I fear, better sustained;
and she sometimes wrote also to my wife, inclosing flowers or fragrant leaves
with a verse or two. Once she sent her one of George Eliot's books, I think
Middlemarch, and wrote, "I am bringing you a little granite book for you to
lean upon." At other times she would send a single poem, such as these: --

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre>THE BLUE JAY.

No brigadier throughout the year
So civic as the jay.
A neighbor and a warrior too, 
With shrill felicity
Pursuing winds that censure us
A February Day, 
The brother of the universe
Was never blown away. 
The snow and he are intimate;
I've often seen them play
When heaven looked upon us all
With such severity
I felt apology were due
To an insulted sky
Whose pompous frown was nutriment
To their temerity.
The pillow of this daring head
Is pungent evergreens;
His larder--terse and militant--
Unknown, refreshing things;
His character--a tonic;
His future--a dispute;
Unfair an immortality
That leaves this neighbor out.


THE WHITE HEAT.

Dare you see a soul at the white heat?
     Then crouch within the door;
Red is the fire's common tint, 
     But when the vivid ore

Has sated flame's conditions, 
     Its quivering substance plays
Without a color, but the light
     Of unanointed blaze.

Least village boasts its blacksmith, 
     Whose anvil's even din
Stands symbol for the finer forge
     That soundless tugs within,

Refining these impatient ores
     With hammer and with blaze, 
Until the designated light
     Repudiated the forge.
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

Then came the death of her father, that strong Puritan father who had
communicated to her so much of the vigor of his own nature, and who bought her
many books, but begged her not to read them. Mr. Edward Dickinson, after
service in the national House of Representatives and other public positions,
had become a member of the lower house of the Massachusetts legislature. The
session was unusually prolonged, and he was making a speech upon some railway
question at noon, one very hot day (July 16, 1874), when he became suddenly
faint and sat down. The house adjourned, and a friend walked with him to his
lodgings at the Tremont House; where he began to pack his bag for home, after
sending for a physician, but died within three hours. Soon afterwards, I
received the following letter:--<p>

<blockquote>

That last afternoon that my father lived, though with no premonition, I
preferred to be with him, and invented an absence for mother, Vinnie [her
sister] being asleep. He seemed peculiarly pleased, as I oftenest stayed with
myself; and remarked, as the afternoon withdrew, he "would like it not to end."
<p>

<p>

His pleasure almost embarrassed me, and my brother coming, I suggested they
walk. Next morning I woke him for the train, and saw him no more. <p>

<p>

His heart was pure and terrible, and I think no other like it exists. <p>

<p>

I am glad there is immortality, but would have tested it myself, before
entrusting him. Mr. Bowles was with us. With that exception, I saw none. I have
wished for you, since my father died, and had you an hour unengrossed, it would
be almost priceless. Thank you for your kindness...<p>

</blockquote>

Later she wrote:--<p>

<blockquote>

When I think of my father's lonely life and lonelier death, there is this
redress--

<blockquote>
<pre>Take all away;
The only thing worth larceny
Is left--the immortality.
</pre>
</blockquote>

My earliest friend wrote me the week before he died, "If I live, I will go to
Amherst; if I die, I certainly will."<p>

<p>

Is your house deeper off?<p>

<p>

YOUR SCHOLAR.<p>

</blockquote>

A year afterward came this;--<p>

<blockquote>

DEAR FRIEND,--Mother was paralyzed Tuesday, a year from the evening father
died. I thought perhaps you would care. <p>               YOUR SCHOLAR.<p>

</blockquote>

With this came the following verse, having a curious seventeenth-century
flavor:--

<blockquote>
<pre>A death-blow is a life-blow to some, 
Who, till they died, did not alive become;
Who, had they lived, had died, but when
They died, vitality begun.
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>

And later came this kindred memorial of one of the oldest and most faithful
friends of the family, Mr. Samuel Bowles of the Springfield Republican:--<p>

<blockquote>

DEAR FRIEND,--I felt it shelter to speak to you. <p>

<p>

My brother and sister are with Mr. Bowles, who is buried this afternoon. <p>

<p>

The last song that I heard--that was, since the birds--was "He leadeth me, he
leadeth me; yea though I walk"--then the voices stooped, the arch was so low.
</blockquote>

<p>

After this added bereavement the inward life of the diminished household became
only more concentrated, and the world was held farther and farther away. Yet to
this period belongs the following letter, written about 1880, which has more of
what is commonly called the objective or external quality then any she ever
wrote me; and shows how close might have been her observation and her sympathy,
had her rare qualities taken a somewhat different channel:--<p>

<blockquote>

DEAR FRIEND,--I was touchingly reminded of [a child who had died] this morning
by an Indian woman with gay baskets and a dazzling baby, at the kitchen door.
Her little boy "once died" she said, death to her dispelling him. I asked her
what the baby liked, and she said "to step." The prairie before the door was
gay with flowers of hay, and I led her in. She argued with the birds, she
leaned on clover walls and they fell, and dropped her. With jargon sweater than
a bell, she grappled buttercups, and they sank together, the buttercups the
heaviest. What sweetest use of days! 'T was noting some such scene made Vaughan
humbly say, "My days that are at best but dim and hoary." I think it was
Vaughan.... </blockquote>

<p>

And these few fragmentary memorials--closing, like every human biography, with
funerals, yet with such as were to Emily Dickinson only the stately
introduction to a higher life--may well end with her description of the death
of the summer she so loved.
<blockquote><blockquote><pre>
As imperceptibly as grief
The summer lapsed away, 
Too imperceptibly to last
To feel like perfidy.

A quietness distilled, 
As twilight long begun,
Or Nature spending with herself
Sequestered afternoon.

The dusk drew earlier in, 
The morning foreign shone, 
A courteous yet harrowing grace
As guests that would be gone. 

And thus without a wing
Or service of a keel
Our summer made her light escape
Into the Beautiful.</pre></blockquote></blockquote>

They are trusted and treated like other human beings; they come and	go almost as freely as the members of the jailer's own family; so far as	possible whatever suggests punishment or disgrace is banished; and they are	made to feel that their imprisonment is designed to improve them as men, and to	restore them to social life not only with full self-respect but with the	cordial respect of the community.<p>		<p>		<p>		To do all this in defiance of the powerful prejudice against 'criminals' will	be called a large undertaking. Up to a certain point it has been done, and that	point is so advanced that we may almost consider the whole victory gained. In	Montpelier, where this prison stands, the inveterate prejudice against	prisoners has been swept away. So great is the significance of this	achievement, denoting as it does a reversal of popular sentiment toward the	criminal, that only something approaching a revolution in the prison system	itself could have produced it. What was this?<p>		<p>		<p>		I visited the Montpelier jail, where I spent the greater part of a day talking	with the prisoners, first in company with the deputy sheriff and then alone,	with full permission to discover opposition to the management if I could. In	this way I made the personal acquaintance of the men. Later, on the main street	of the city, whom should I meet but five or six of the very prisoners, walking	along with smiling faces and a happy air, no more resembling the conventional	criminal than did the merchants, workingmen and lawyers with whom they mingled.	Here was one of the keys to the mystery. No officer was about, keeping an eye	on them; no peculiarity of clothing indicated who they were; they were free to	walk off if they pleased, and no one at the jail was worrying about them; and,	best of all, the citizens of Montpelier, who knew perfectly well that inmates	of the county prison were at all times of the day and evening at large in their	midst, were worrying no more about it than were the sheriff and the assistants	themselves.<p>		<p>		<p>		And yet, four years ago when the system was first put into operation, a very	decided tremor convulsed these very citizens. They were animated by all the	righteous dread and abhorrence of the inhabitants of jails common to ordinary	mankind. They believed that the men were dangerous, that they would run away,	that it was treating them on wrong principles to give them such freedom, and	that it was a disgrace to good people to have criminals going about unguarded	on the same streets. But if you suggest these ancient and wholesome ideas to a	Montpelier man now, he laughs at you; he is ashamed that four years ago he	entertained such superstitions.<p>		<p>		<p>		Nor was the sheriff himself much more confident when he inaugurated the change.	As late as two or three years ago, when the men did not return promptly to the	jail at the time appointed, he would become nervous and go out to walk the	streets looking for them. That is all past now, not only because of the	unsuspected traits of human nature that experience has unfolded, but because of	the marvelous practical success of the system. During the four years, out of	eight hundred prisoners treated upon the new plan only two attempted to escape,	both of whom were recaptured and sentenced to long terms in the House of	Correction for betraying the trust reposed in them. With such a record as this	the sheriff no longer feels perturbed if his entire corps of prisoners is	scattered in every direction during the day; and he is perfectly assured that	at night they will reappear at the jail.<p>		<p>		<p>		This great innovation in prison practice was made possible by a state law	authorizing all sheriffs to set their prisoners at work either inside or	outside the jails. The text of this law was as follows: ' A male prisoner	imprisoned in a county jail for being found intoxicated, for a breach of the	peace, or for being a tramp, may be required to perform not more than ten hours	of manual labor within or without the walls of such county jail each day of	such imprisonment, except on Sundays or on legal holidays.' To promote the end	in view a prison board was established, composed of the assistant judges, the	sheriff, and county highway supervisor, who 'may require and compel said	prisoners to work on the public highways within the county.'<p>		<p>		<p>		In this law itself there was no particular advance; everything depended on the	execution of it. Commercial and humanitarian motives blended to further the	passage of the law; for on the one hand hundreds of prisoners were sitting idle	in the county jails eating the state into debt, and many were being transported	at great expense from all parts of the state to the House of Correction at	Rutland; and on the other hand young and impressionable offenders were being	carried off to Rutland with more hardened men, there to receive an education in	lawlessness from their experienced associates.<p>		<p>		<p>		It happened that the sheriff of Washington County, in which Montpelier is	located, Frank H. Tracy, was moved to apply the law to large purpose, not	merely to save money for the state, which at first was the best popular appeal,	but to regenerate the prisoners who came under his care. I was interested to	know what motive underneath all others had prompted him to attempt this	innovation, and found it to be the influence of one of his parents, who, though	dead, was now far more alive to him than when living. 'I thought of each	prisoner,' he explained, 'as having a parent with the feelings and hopes for	him that mine had had for me, and reflected that if the prisoners had grown up	in the absence of such an influence they had been defrauded, and deserved only	compassion, not blame, for sinking into the jail.' Such was the creed of a man,	the greater part of whose mature life had been spent in dealing with the	so-called criminal classes. It might seem that one of this sensitive type could	nowhere be more out of place than at the head of a jail, that he would be a	weakling; but it is just this type, and this only, that ought to be at the head	of jails; and as to this sheriff's ability and success, it is enough to say	that no man in Washington County could be elected to the office against him. A	dreamer he is, but one who has dreamed to practical purpose.<p>		<p>		<p>		When the prison-labor law came into effect, his own ideas of what to do with it	were crude. He went about town searching for people to hire the prisoners. No	one would have them; the sane and safe business men were not to be taken in	like that; they comforted him with assurances that he must fail--the same	business men who now send regularly to him for workers when they want help, in	preference to picking up men on the street. Another drawback was that the men	were insufficiently clothed for going out to work in the cold of a Vermont	winter.<p>		<p>		<p>		Since nobody else would trust jailmen to work, the experiment had to begin on	Tracy's own farm, where he set them to cutting bushes and wood, giving the	state fifty cents a day for each and paying the men nothing. He got almost no	return; only when he stood over them constantly could he extort even fifty	cents' worth of work. Later, when a water main was being laid, because of the	scarcity of labor a dollar a day was offered and accepted for the prisoners'	services, all of it as before going to the state. Regular workingmen were	receiving $1.75 daily. Dressed in distinguishing blue trousers and overalls and	attended by guards, the prisoners did worse each day than the day before. The	experiment was a grim failure.<p>		<p>		<p>		One day, much discouraged, the sheriff called one of the group into his office	for a heart-to-heart talk, asking him to say frankly why he did not do more.<p>		<p>		<p>		'I'm doing just as little as I can and not be punished, and I'm going to keep	on. You would do the same,' answered the man.<p>		<p>		<p>		This 'You would do the same' caused Tracy to imagine himself in the prisoner's	place, and to see that the words were true. What incentive had the fellows to	labor? They got nothing out of it.<p>		<p>		<p>		'If you could have seventy-five cents for yourself from your work each day,	what would you do?' asked the sheriff.<p>		<p>		<p>		'Try me,' was the answer; and the next day he went out and worked as well as	any freeman in the entire gang--this incorrigibly obstinate idler while there	was no incentive.<p>		<p>		<p>		Such was the beginning of the system of paying the men all that they earn above	a fixed amount, which goes to the state. One dollar a day is set aside from the	wages of each for the state, while all in excess of that belongs to the earner.	As it works out in figures, every man in ordinary health earns the full	laborer's pay of $1.75 a day, of which seventy-five cents is his, the sheriff	acting as his banker and keeping the accumulation until he leaves the prison,	when it is given to him in a lump sum.<p>		<p>		<p>		The profits accruing to the state from the experiment have steadily increased.	At the end of the first year they were $200; of the second, $500; of the third,	$1000; after having paid for all clothing, tools, and supervision in the form	of keeping the books and other clerical work. At the close of the fourth year,	in the latter part of 1910, the gross earnings for the state were over $1800.	Since an amount equal to three-fourths of this was retained by the men, their	share was more than $1350. Some had been allowed to purchase necessaries for	their families out of their portion, thus lessening the deprivation of their	wives and children due to their imprisonment. During the whole period their	labor earned above $6000, of which a total exceeding $2600 was kept by	themselves. As a rule the men have carefully saved their money, limiting	permitted purchases for themselves, to send it home to those dependent on	them.<p>		<p>		<p>		Since of the thirteen counties in Vermont but three or four have attempted to	follow the example so well worked out for them, in view of the above results it	is not surprising that indignation should be felt in the state at their failure	to do so. In fact, the inertia of county officials is responsible for their	failure to adopt the new system in obedience to the law. Under the Montpelier	system the sheriff has to be a good deal more than the mere old-fashioned	jail-master. He must develop a combined labor bureau and labor exchange, which	means that he cannot sit and wait for people to come after his workmen, but	must go out and solicit places for them, until the habit of hiring them is well	grounded in the community. And we shall see that this is but the beginning of	his new responsibilities if he is a big-enough-minded man for his place.<p>		<p>		<p>		Now, the financial side of the undertaking, brilliant as it has been, is but	the smallest part of the good it accomplishes; its real value is to be measured	by its effect upon the characters and lives of the prisoners. On this point	only one view is possible, and when it is understood, there can be no excuse	for perpetuating the old system anywhere.<p>		<p>		<p>		To begin with, what does it do for the health of the men, on which character is	primarily based? They leave the jail rugged and healthy from the sane and	vigorous existence they have led while there. Their habits have been regular,	they have been daily in the open air when work could be had, their food has	been substantial, the atmosphere in which they lived salutary. We can	understand why many of them should go forth in a great deal better condition	physically than they were when they entered.<p>		<p>		<p>		Through having worked in this manner they have escaped the formation of the	loafing diathesis. Among the many crimes prisons have to answer for, their	creation of chronic loafers is one of the gravest. A prisoner isn't responsible	for becoming a lazy loafer if he isn't allowed to work. He very probably goes	out and remains what the state made him, a loafer; and gets a second term to	punish him for it, and make him a worse loafer. The amazing system of American	justice penalizes him for what it has made of him. But the Vermont plan not	only doesn't produce loafers, but by putting a double premium on good work goes	far toward curing those already manufactured by society; for besides the pay	for work there is the still more enticing reward of getting out of jail and	being a practically free man the whole of each day. Furthermore, who would feel	like physical work if his muscles had been softening for want of exercise in	the stale atmosphere of a prison for from twenty to a hundred days or a year?	The bare thought of enduring it is horrible, apart from its ineradicable	effects.<p>		<p>		<p>		Prison idleness breaks the current between the man and life, so that when he	emerges it is hard for him to form connections again. If he had a job before,	it is now lost. Who wants an ex-prisoner anyway? He must begin to hunt work,	and to hunt under suspicion; his nerve has probably weakened a little too;	therefore, after a series of failures he gets well drunk and goes back to jail	for another term at the public expense. These obstacles to reformation are	swept away when the prisoner preserves his connection with the community by	working in it like any one else. In many cases when liberated he simply keeps	right on at the same job, or his worth as a worker is known and he easily gets	another. If he wants to go elsewhere he has money in his pocket to do it, not	as a shamefaced pauper either; he has a good round sum to go on, an advantage	which preserves many of these prison graduates from vagabondage.<p>		<p>		<p>		And not only do others respect him even though he has slept behind bars, but he	respects himself. Why prisons should be employed to break down men's	self-respect remains for wiser people than exist to-day to explain. Those among	whom and for whom he works see him every day behaving himself, and soon,	practically forgetting that he is a 'criminal' or a 'convict,' treat him as if	he were not one. Nevertheless he does not forget his actual position, and a	state of contrast is created in his mind which stimulates him to reformation.	That state of contrast is this. Having always been accustomed to stand on a	level with his neighbors and associates, the imposition of a jail sentence	brings soreness and humiliation; he believes that others despise him and wish	to shun him; when he finds that they do not, and that they still treat him as a	man, a feeling of mingled surprise, gratitude, elation, and pride awakes in	him; he learns for the first time the value of social esteem and determines to	deserve it. This is the psychology of reformation. It would be still better,	however, if he were certain that no one would scorn him for his lapse.<p>		<p>		<p>		The only adverse feeling justifiable toward a lawbreaker is that he is weak or	deficient; and it is a sufficient humiliation for him to be considered so,	without an accompaniment of aversion or scorn. Would it not be well also to	inquire with some care whether most criminals actually are deficient or weak?	Many people go so far as to think that society imposes such hard conditions on	the under half of the wage-earners that the commission of some of the lesser	offenses is a saving evidence of strength and manhood, being the protest that a	self-respecting man ought to make against the unrighteous conditions,--the only	protest also that some of them have yet learned how to make.<p>		<p>		<p>		In the Montpelier jail I noted a buoyancy and cheerfulness that I had never	seen in any other prison. Other prisons have a sickening pall of gloom upon	them, from which an inmate for even the briefest period takes permanent	soul-poisoning. It is like going to a hospital to be cured of one disease and	catching a worse one there which devitalizes the victim for life. Every	ordinary jail reeks with this moral infection. Its germs pervade the place just	as the most noxious physical germs filled the English prisons of the eighteenth	century, killing the inmates, keepers, and magistrates by wholesale. Now, it is	the deadly spiritual atmosphere corresponding to this that the Vermont system	has conquered and expelled. It is no use to pulverize a man's soul with	punishment; if you would make him better you must show him a better kind of	happiness than he has been accustomed to, you must begin with small doses and	increase them just as rapidly as you find his system can stand more, until he	has contracted the higher-happiness habit so firmly that he cannot throw it	off. That is what our prisons ought to do for men, and can do for them; the	Montpelier prison is doing it as far as its resources allow.<p>		<p>		<p>		It was typical of this revolution in jail method that when a circus visited the	city, Sheriff Tracy purchased tickets for as many of the prisoners as desired	to go, and sent them off, unattended, to enjoy themselves. Eleven went, the	others refusing because they preferred the money they would earn by helping the	farmers, who were then under pressure in the hayfields. It was an excellent	chance to run away, for the circus continued till after dark; yet every one of	them was back at the jail fifteen minutes after the tent closed, although among	the eleven were men with the incentive of a long term to tempt them to	escape.<p>		<p>		<p>		The system has succeeded because of the trust reposed in the prisoners and the	freedom accorded them. Under the old law it was an honor to get out of the cage	into the corridors, while now none are confined in the cage unless for	exceptional reasons.<p>		<p>		<p>		Vermont goes after visible drunkenness with a rod of iron. For the second	offense the law punishes intoxication with ten to fifteen dollars fine and	costs, or an alternative penalty of thirty days in jail, or, if the judge	desires, both. The last of these sentences, the combination of fine and jail,	gives the poor chap who cannot pay his fine ninety-six days in prison--thirty	days of direct penalty, forty-five days to serve out the fifteen-dollar fine,	and twenty-one days more to extinguish costs. It is difficult to see why the	state does not punish itself much more than it punishes the drinker by this	law, except where the labor system is applied.<p>		<p>		<p>		The law is also unjust, for seldom is any one but a poor man caught in its net.	One with money pays his fine and walks gayly off, while one chargeable with the	sinister crime of empty pockets not only loses his liberty but receives a	brand. Of course, this phase of the injustice is not peculiar to Vermont, being	still a widely prevailing barbarism of criminal procedure. The remedy is to let	a man out on probation to earn his fine if he can't pay it, not detaining him	in prison a day.<p>		<p>		<p>		Doubtless the first question to occur to many will be how the working classes	of the region have regarded this form of prison labor. It is a very pertinent	inquiry, because Montpelier and the section about it are the stronghold of	organized labor in Vermont. At first the innovation was viewed with suspicion	in labor ranks, but all that has passed and given place to a feeling of	grateful appreciation of the sheriff's efforts. Thus far the prisoners,	although they may have learned a trade, have only been sent out to common work;	but I was assured by one of the trade-union leaders that there would not be the	slightest objection on the part of the unions to any man with a trade	exercising it, provided he were given union wages, as for doing common labor he	is paid current wages. No objection is made to the part of his earnings that	goes to the state, which is considered a legitimate division.<p>		<p>		<p>		This position is so entirely reasonable that it seems that, if applied at	large, it would solve the prison-labor problem. Apparently, only, does the	prisoner come into competition with the outside worker in a way disadvantageous	to the latter, through the circumstance that the prisoner gets his board and	lodging in the jail while the free man has to pay for his. If some of the	prisoner's wage is withheld toward meeting the state expenses for his	subsistence, however, he is doing the same as the outside laborer, except that	his landlord is the state instead of a private boarding-house keeper. But if,	on the other hand, the prisoner does not work to pay for his jail-keep, who	does foot the bill? The taxpayers, of whom the working-classes are a large	percentage. When prisoners are maintained in idleness the working people	provide their full share of the prisoners' support, if not, through being	unskillful tax-dodgers, a good deal more than their share. The portion of the	prisoner's wage reserved by the state cuts down these taxes, thereby enlarging	outside laborers' incomes; what it sent to the prisoner's family often saves it	from requiring aid from the town, thus again reducing taxes.<p>		<p>		<p>		As to the inmate's competition with other laborers: if he were out of jail he	would be competing just as much and no fault would be found. What element of	difference is added by his being confined for wrong-doing? his being	disciplined for breaking a law has no relation at all to his right and duty to	earn his living exactly as if he were free.<p>		<p>		<p>		Injustice would arise if the prison were to send skilled men out to toil for	less than union wages, for the reason that this would be state discrimination	against the unions in their struggle to improve the standard of life. To avoid	this it will be sound policy for prison authorities to place out at ordinary	work all skilled laborers who are declared incompetent by employers to earn	union rates at their trade. No employer would then be tempted purposely to	cheapen a prisoner's value in the hope of getting his services for less pay.<p>		<p>		<p>		The general prison-labor problem can be met with justice to all parties by	extending this system to all prisons, wholly abolishing the objectionable	contract-labor plan. For men who cannot be trusted to go outside to work on the	terms described, various form of productive labor should be provided within the	jail walls by the state authorities, every species of exploitation being	excluded and the men receiving their proper quota as wages. The product could	be sold on the market at market rates with entire fairness, since the men would	be in every sense precisely like other productive laborers, except that they	would be working inside one walled space instead of another. Men who would	otherwise be working and competing for work in private factories would as	prisoners merely be transferred to another factory, owned by the community. The	work and competition would remain the same as before.<p>		<p>		<p>		There is impropriety in permitting a private firm to conduct a prison shop,	even on the most favorable commercial terms for the state, because for many of	the prisoners the work should be a form of treatment and upbuilding which	necessitates favoring the weak and deficient. To accustom prisoners to think of	themselves as fully reinstated members of industrial society, between whom and	others there is no break, is the best way to cure the criminal habits of most	of them.<p>		<p>		<p>		On the question of applying the honor method to long-term penitentiary men, I	think the conclusion is fair that it could safely be extended to a great	number. Its advantages to them would first need to be made clear to their	minds: they would have to be shown in how many ways their lives would be made	happier if they proved trustworthy, and that most of the hardships commonly	incident to imprisonment would be removed, reducing the gain from escape, even	if successful, to a very small sum.<p>		<p>		<p>		And it seems to me that this is the real secret of the honor system. Jail life	can be made so decent, so humane, so upbuilding, interesting, and even	inspiring, that for the average convict it will be superior to the existence he	leads in the outer world. Why should he run away from it then? What would he	gain? But is this not a negation of the true prison purpose? Isn't it rewarding	a man for crime? Will it not fill up the prisons with men who will commit light	crimes in order to break into jail and enjoy themselves in a secure home?<p>		<p>		<p>		What if it does, if they are evolved into better men there, fitted to live in	general society afterward on their own feet? If that can be done for them by	jails, we ought to found other such institutions for men to reside in for	improvement, free from the ordeal of entrance examinations on the crimes to	their credit, with exclusion as the penalty for having abstained from crime.	They would pay their way by their work. But if they did not pay their way in	immediate cash, in the long run they would remunerate society with compound	interest by becoming better-grade human beings. <p>		<p>		<p>		There is nothing so costly to human society as the criminal. He supports the	policemen, the detectives, the sheriffs, the lawyers, the judges, the	jail-builders, the providers of prisoners' food and clothes. Not, of course,	bearing all these massive fees of 'justice' out of his own pocket, but out of	the pockets of the community, which he forces to pay the bills. Think of the	criminal's power to bleed society, like war and disease, without a scintilla of	gain. Would it not be worth while to plant a few institutions, to be mostly	supported by the criminal himself, to cure the criminal? Would it not be	socially cheaper, in something like the ration of infinity to one? Until these	regenerative institutions are devised, I see no objection to making the jails	so attractive that criminals will voluntarily stay in them until cured.<p>		<p>		<p>		Crime is a disease that usually exists in the body, of different entity from	the person committing the crime. It is a disease of society, which merely	breaks out in open manifestation in this and that individual in whom the social	circulation particularly concentrates the poison. And the jail, properly	understood, is a hospital for these exceptionally infected persons. That is, it	should be so, and it is illegitimate as anything else.<p>		<p>		<p>		In the earlier stages of the honor period, before the convict completely	realizes the benefits of the prison cure, other very potent incentives not to	take flight when trusted can be brought into play. A heavy penalty in the form	of a much lengthened sentence, with deprivation of many privileges, will act as	a strong deterrent; pursuit with such vigor as to render final freedom almost	an impossibility will increase the restraint; and the formation of a prison	public-opinion among the better inmates, resting upon an appreciation of the	treatment accorded them, would erect a barrier to the escape of others which	would be almost equal to complete prevention.<p>		<p>		<p>		These propositions are, happily, not mere theory. The Montpelier experiment	has, in its field, demonstrated them. The inmates enter the lists as	cooperating reformers of their weaker brothers. Or if, as may be, the	rebellious are the more high-spirited and daring, the majority help to curb	them in order to establish firmly a regime in which prison life in its whole	extent will be redeemed from its contaminating sordidness and degradation.<p>		<p>		<p>		There is no reason why this state of mind cannot be generated in the majority	of penitentiary inmates. Convince them that society is not bent upon revenging	itself on them for their crimes, and the work is three-fourths done. If this is	doubted we have only to consider the results of the parole system, which is a	kindred branch of criminal reform. how profoundly prison practice is being	transformed by the growth of parole may be seen from an event which not very	long ago would have dumfounded society. It is related in a dispatch to eastern	newspapers from Los Angeles [See Endnote 1]:--<p>		<p>		<p>		'A murderer, four highwaymen, five burglars, two forgers, and three ordinary	citizens sat down last night at a banquet in a prominent hotel as the guests of	Leonard Mordaunt, himself an ex-convict, who is now at the head of the Prison	Parole fund of the Union Rescue Mission.<p>		<p>		<p>		'It was largely through the efforts of Mordaunt that twelve of the guest were	released from San Quentin on parole, and the particular purpose of the meeting	was to have them meet Frank Mulford, State Parole Officer. The banquet was such	a success that it was decided to hold another, to which all paroled men in Los	Angeles will be invited. There are about forty-five here. Mordaunt believes	such gatherings will serve as a moral support to former criminals.'<p>		<p>		<p>		How far society should press its activities to prove its freedom from motives	of revenge toward the criminal and its will to raise him to the highest level	of manhood, does not fall within the scope of this paper. Sheriff Tracy	believes that each prison should have an officer exempted from all the ordinary	duties of a sheriff, to devote his whole time to developing personal relations	with the men, to studying them individually, to learning what forces have	shaped their lives, and to thinking out ways to counteract the tendencies that	have been produced in each to offend against society. Such work would be	extremely arduous, and would require a man of high intellectual grade and	character. Nevertheless the saving to the people would be great. the deeper	causes of crimes would be unearthed and published in reports to the community,	supplying the first essentials for the prevention of crime. It might be found,	for example, that the chief root of crime is irregular or insufficient	employment, when the first duty of the state, in order to empty the prisons	would be to organize demand for labor so that no one would be idle. Nothing	should be easier to do if society realized its importance. The wealth created	by the labor of the men would support them and pay all the costs of organizing	the work they might do.<p>		<p>		Not to understand the sense of injustice over their imprisonment which rankles	in many of the prison group, would be to fail to grasp one of the principal	threads of reformation. The unfortunate fact, as Sheriff Tracy illustrated from	his own knowledge, is that they are often justified in their resentment. 'The	rich,' said he, 'escape by process of law, because they can buy legal skill.	They press their case farther in the courts than the poor man can do, and get	out on technicalities.'<p>		<p>		<p>		The principle carried so far in Vermont is beginning to work elsewhere. Deputy	Sheriff Richardson, of the jail in Worcester County, Massachusetts, is	introducing music into that institution, for the moral development as well as	the entertainment of the prisoners, believing that the monotony of prison life	has a ruinous effect on the natures of the men.<p>		<p>		<p>		Probation officer James P. Ramsey, of Lowell, Massachusetts, who receives about	twenty-five per cent of all the cases convicted in Middlesex County, affirms	that the records of his work show that 'sixty-seven percent of those he has	helped have reformed permanently and gone back to industrious and respectable	life.'<p>		<p>		<p>		Prisoners in Rhode Island State Prison and in the Providence County jail are	about to be given a share of the profits of those institutions. <p>		<p>		<p>		Another incitement to the adoption of a new penal system is the awakening to	the cruel ravages of consumption in the jails. Dr. J.B. Ransom, of Clinton	Prison, Dannemora, N.Y., finds that from forty to sixty per cent of all deaths	in the prisons of the world are due to tuberculosis, and that at times the	mortality from this cause has reached eighty per cent. "Of the five thousand	prisoners in New York State alone, one thousand are tubercular. 'There is no	greater error,' he declares, 'than to imagine that tuberculosis in prisons,	because of the isolation of the institutions, does not constitute a great	danger to society at large. There are twenty thousand tubercular prisoners in	the penal institutions of the United States, and the overwhelming majority of	these, when let loose, return to the very classes of people--indigent dwellers	in congested districts and stuffy tenements--where the disease is most quickly	and most virulently spread. Tuberculosis is a disease that invariably spreads	from the lower strata of society upward.'<p>		<p>		<p>		Dr. Ransom's proposed remedies are 'a systematic campaign for the treatment of	tubercular inmates of prisons, jails, detention institutions, and charity	institutions, the most important features of such a campaign being the	establishment of special institutions for treatment and the providing of	outdoor work [See Endnote 2].<p>		<p>		<p>		These campaigns would obviously be needless if the prisons were made sanitary	and a healthful regimen of outdoor work were provided before the inmates	contract the disease. The writer was informed that a remarkable improvement in	the health of the prisoners in the Vermont State Prison had followed from the	introduction of a proper ventilating plant by the present management.<p>		<p>		<p>		Finally, a new and just form of prison sentence, is already beginning to find	acceptance. Five thousand dollars was embezzled from a Los Angeles theatre and	dissipated in high living by a man twenty-one years old. He confessed and	received this sentence from the judge:--<p>		<p>		<p>		'You shall stay at home nights. You shall remain within the limits of this	county. You shall not play billiards or pool, frequent cafes or drink	intoxicating liquor, and you shall go immediately to work and keep at it until	you have paid back every dollar you stole. Violate these terms and you go to	prison.'<p>		<p>		<p>		<font size=-1>[Endnote 1: February 5, 1911.]<p>		<p>		[Endnote 2: From the report of an address by Dr. Ransom before the Society of	Medical Jurisprudence, at the New York Academy of Medicine, February 13,	1911.]<p></font>	</blockquote><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly.

<blockquote><i><font size=4>In America "whites once set themselves apart from blacks and claimed privileges

for themselves while denying them to others," the author writes. "Now, on the

basis of race, blacks are claiming special status and reserving for themselves

privileges they deny to others. Isn't one as bad as the other? The answer is

no"</i></font><p>



<p>



<p><br><p><br>



<font size=5>I</font> take my text from George Bush, who, in an address to the United Nations on

September 23, 1991, said this of the UN resolution equating Zionism with

racism: "Zionism . . . is the idea that led to the creation of a home for the

Jewish people. . . . And to equate Zionism with the intolerable sin of racism

is to twist history and forget the terrible plight of Jews in World War II and

indeed throughout history." What happened in the Second World War was that six

million Jews were exterminated by people who regarded them as racially inferior

and a danger to Aryan purity. What happened after the Second World War was that

the survivors of that Holocaust established a Jewish state--that is, a state

centered on Jewish history, Jewish values, and Jewish traditions: in short, a

Jewocentric state. What President Bush objected to was the logical sleight of

hand by which these two actions were declared equivalent because they were both

expressions of racial exclusiveness. Ignored, as Bush said, was the historical

difference between them--the difference between a program of genocide and the

determination of those who escaped it to establish a community in which they

would be the makers, not the victims, of the laws.<p>



Only if racism is thought of as something that occurs principally in the mind,

a falling-away from proper notions of universal equality, can the desire of a

victimized and terrorized people to band together be declared morally identical

to the actions of their would-be executioners. Only when the actions of the two

groups are detached from the historical conditions of their emergence and given

a purely abstract description can they be made interchangeable. Bush was saying

to the United Nations, "Look, the Nazis' conviction of racial superiority

generated a policy of systematic genocide; the Jews' experience of centuries of

persecution in almost every country on earth generated a desire for a homeland

of their own. If you manage somehow to convince yourself that these are the

same, it is you, not the Zionists, who are morally confused, and the reason you

are morally confused is that you have forgotten history."<p>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>A KEY DISTINCTION</B><P>



<font size=5>W</font>HAT I want to say, following Bush's reasoning, is that a similar forgetting of

history has in recent years allowed some people to argue, and argue

persuasively, that affirmative action is reverse racism. The very phrase

"reverse racism" contains the argument in exactly the form to which Bush

objected: In this country whites once set themselves apart from blacks and

claimed privileges for themselves while denying them to others. Now, on the

basis of race, blacks are claiming special status and reserving for themselves

privileges they deny to others. Isn't one as bad as the other? The answer is

no. One can see why by imagining that it is not 1993 but 1955, and that we are

in a town in the South with two more or less distinct communities, one white

and one black. No doubt each community would have a ready store of dismissive

epithets, ridiculing stories, self-serving folk myths, and expressions of plain

hatred, all directed at the other community, and all based in racial hostility.

Yet to regard their respective racisms--if that is the word--as equivalent

would be bizarre, for the hostility of one group stems not from any wrong done

to it but from its wish to protect its ability to deprive citizens of their

voting rights, to limit access to educational institutions, to prevent entry

into the economy except at the lowest and most menial levels, and to force

members of the stigmatized group to ride in the back of the bus. The hostility

of the other group is the result of these actions, and whereas hostility and

racial anger are unhappy facts wherever they are found, a distinction must

surely be made between the ideological hostility of the oppressors and the

experience-based hostility of those who have been oppressed.<p>



Not to make that distinction is, adapting George Bush's words, to twist history

and forget the terrible plight of African-Americans in the more than 200 years

of this country's existence. Moreover, to equate the efforts to remedy that

plight with the actions that produced it is to twist history even further.

Those efforts, designed to redress the imbalances caused by long-standing

discrimination, are called affirmative action; to argue that affirmative

action, which gives preferential treatment to disadvantaged minorities as part

of a plan to achieve social equality, is no different from the policies that

created the disadvantages in the first place is a travesty of reasoning.

"Reverse racism" is a cogent description of affirmative action only if one

considers the cancer of racism to be morally and medically indistinguishable

from the therapy we apply to it. A cancer is an invasion of the body's

equilibrium, and so is chemotherapy; but we do not decline to fight the disease

because the medicine we employ is also disruptive of normal functioning. Strong

illness, strong remedy: the formula is as appropriate to the health of the body

politic as it is to that of the body proper.<p>



At this point someone will always say, "But two wrongs don't make a right; if

it was wrong to treat blacks unfairly, it is wrong to give blacks preference

and thereby treat whites unfairly." This objection is just another version of

the forgetting and rewriting of history. The work is done by the adverb

"unfairly," which suggests two more or less equal parties, one of whom has been

unjustly penalized by an incompetent umpire. But blacks have not simply been

treated unfairly; they have been subjected first to decades of slavery, and

then to decades of second-class citizenship, widespread legalized

discrimination, economic persecution, educational deprivation, and cultural

stigmatization. They have been bought, sold, killed, beaten, raped, excluded,

exploited, shamed, and scorned for a very long time. The word "unfair" is

hardly an adequate description of their experience, and the belated gift of

"fairness" in the form of a resolution no longer to discriminate against them

legally is hardly an adequate remedy for the deep disadvantages that the prior

discrimination has produced. When the deck is stacked against you in more ways

than you can even count, it is small consolation to hear that you are now free

to enter the game and take your chances.<p>

<BR>

<BR>





<B>A TILTED FIELD</B><P>



<font size=5>T</font>HE same insincerity and hollowness of promise infect another formula that is

popular with the anti-affirmative-action crowd: the formula of the level

playing field. Here the argument usually takes the form of saying "It is

undemocratic to give one class of citizens advantages at the expense of other

citizens; the truly democratic way is to have a level playing field to which

everyone has access and where everyone has a fair and equal chance to succeed

on the basis of his or her merit." Fine words--but they conceal the facts of

the situation as it has been given to us by history: the playing field is

already tilted in favor of those by whom and for whom it was constructed in the

first place. If mastery of the requirements for entry depends upon immersion in

the cultural experiences of the mainstream majority, if the skills that make

for success are nurtured by institutions and cultural practices from which the

disadvantaged minority has been systematically excluded, if the language and

ways of comporting oneself that identify a player as "one of us" are alien to

the lives minorities are forced to live, then words like "fair" and "equal" are

cruel jokes, for what they promote and celebrate is an institutionalized

unfairness and a perpetuated inequality. The playing field is already tilted,

and the resistance to altering it by the mechanisms of affirmative action is in

fact a determination to make sure that the present imbalances persist as long

as possible. <p>



One way of tilting the field is the Scholastic Aptitude Test. This test figures

prominently in Dinesh D'Souza's book Illiberal Education (1991), in which one

finds many examples of white or Asian students denied admission to colleges and

universities even though their SAT scores were higher than the scores of some

others--often African-Americans--who were admitted to the same institution.

This, D'Souza says, is evidence that as a result of affirmative-action policies

colleges and universities tend "to depreciate the importance of merit criteria

in admissions." D'Souza's assumption--and it is one that many would share--is

that the test does in fact measure merit, with merit understood as a quality

objectively determined in the same way that body temperature can be objectively

determined.<p>



In fact, however, the test is nothing of the kind. Statistical studies have

suggested that test scores reflect income and socioeconomic status. It has been

demonstrated again and again that scores vary in relation to cultural

background; the test's questions assume a certain uniformity in educational

experience and lifestyle and penalize those who, for whatever reason, have had

a different experience and lived different kinds of lives. In short, what is

being measured by the SAT is not absolutes like native ability and merit but

accidents like birth, social position, access to libraries, and the opportunity

to take vacations or to take SAT prep courses. <p>





Furthermore, as David Owen notes in None of the Above: Behind the Myth of

Scholastic Aptitude (1985), the "correlation between SAT scores and college

grades . . . is lower than the correlation between weight and height; in other

words you would have a better chance of predicting a person's height by looking

at his weight than you would of predicting his freshman grades by looking only

at his SAT scores." Everywhere you look in the SAT story, the claims of

fairness, objectivity, and neutrality fall away, to be replaced by suspicions

of specialized measures and unfair advantages.<p>





Against this background a point that in isolation might have a questionable

force takes on a special and even explanatory resonance: the principal deviser

of the test was an out-and-out racist. In 1923 Carl Campbell Brigham published

a book called A Study of American Intelligence, in which, as Owen notes, he

declared, among other things, that we faced in America "a possibility of racial

admixture . . . infinitely worse than that faced by any European country today,

for we are incorporating the Negro into our racial stock, while all of Europe

is comparatively free of this taint." Brigham had earlier analyzed the Army

Mental Tests using classifications drawn from another racist text, Madison

Grant's The Passing of the Great Race, which divided American society into four

distinct racial strains, with Nordic, blue-eyed, blond people at the pinnacle

and the American Negro at the bottom. Nevertheless, in 1925 Brigham became a

director of testing for the College Board, and developed the SAT. So here is

the great SAT test, devised by a racist in order to confirm racist assumptions,

measuring not native ability but cultural advantage, an uncertain indicator of

performance, an indicator of very little except what money and social privilege

can buy. And it is in the name of this mechanism that we are asked to reject

affirmative action and reaffirm "the importance of merit criteria in

admissions."<p>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>THE REALITY OF DISCRIMINATION</B><P>



<font size=5>N</font>EVERTHELESS, there is at least one more card to play against affirmative

action, and it is a strong one. Granted that the playing field is not level and

that access to it is reserved for an already advantaged elite, the

disadvantages suffered by others are less racial--at least in 1993--than

socioeconomic. Therefore shouldn't, as D'Souza urges, "universities . . .

retain their policies of preferential treatment, but alter their criteria of

application from race to socioeconomic disadvantage," and thus avoid the

unfairness of current policies that reward middle-class or affluent blacks at

the expense of poor whites? One answer to this question is given by D'Souza

himself when he acknowledges that the overlap between minority groups and the

poor is very large--a point underscored by the former Secretary of Education

Lamar Alexander, who said, in response to a question about funds targeted for

black students, "Ninety-eight percent of race-specific scholarships do not

involve constitutional problems." He meant, I take it, that 98 percent of

race-specific scholarships were also scholarships to the economically

disadvantaged.<p>



Still, the other two percent--nonpoor, middle-class, economically favored

blacks--are receiving special attention on the basis of disadvantages they do

not experience. What about them? The force of the question depends on the

assumption that in this day and age race could not possibly be a serious

disadvantage to those who are otherwise well positioned in the society. But the

lie was given dramatically to this assumption in a 1991 broadcast of the ABC

program PrimeTime Live. In a stunning fifteen-minute segment reporters and a

camera crew followed two young men of equal education, cultural sophistication,

level of apparent affluence, and so forth around St. Louis, a city where

neither was known. The two differed in only a single respect: one was white,

the other black. But that small difference turned out to mean everything. In a

series of encounters with shoe salesmen, record-store employees, rental agents,

landlords, employment agencies, taxicab drivers, and ordinary citizens, the

black member of the pair was either ignored or given a special and suspicious

attention. He was asked to pay more for the same goods or come up with a larger

down payment for the same car, was turned away as a prospective tenant, was

rejected as a prospective taxicab fare, was treated with contempt and

irritation by clerks and bureaucrats, and in every way possible was made to

feel inferior and unwanted.<p>



The inescapable conclusion was that alike though they may have been in almost

all respects, one of these young men, because he was black, would lead a

significantly lesser life than his white counterpart: he would be housed less

well and at greater expense; he would pay more for services and products when

and if he was given the opportunity to buy them; he would have difficulty

establishing credit; the first emotions he would inspire on the part of many

people he met would be distrust and fear; his abilities would be discounted

even before he had a chance to display them; and, above all, the treatment he

received from minute to minute would chip away at his self-esteem and

self-confidence with consequences that most of us could not even imagine. As

the young man in question said at the conclusion of the broadcast, "You walk

down the street with a suit and tie and it doesn't matter. Someone will make

determinations about you, determinations that affect the quality of your

life."<p>





Of course, the same determinations are being made quite early on by

kindergarten teachers, grade school principals, high school guidance

counselors, and the like, with results that cut across socioeconomic lines and

place young black men and women in the ranks of the disadvantaged no matter

what the bank accounts of their parents happen to show. Racism is a cultural

fact, and although its effects may to some extent be diminished by

socioeconomic variables, those effects will still be sufficiently great to

warrant the nation's attention and thus the continuation of affirmative-action

policies. This is true even of the field thought to be dominated by blacks and

often cited as evidence of the equal opportunities society now affords them. I

refer, of course, to professional athletics. But national self-congratulation

on this score might pause in the face of a few facts: A minuscule number of

African-Americans ever receive a paycheck from a professional team. Even though

nearly 1,600 daily newspapers report on the exploits of black athletes, they

employ only seven full-time black sports columnists. Despite repeated pledges

and resolutions, major-league teams have managed to put only a handful of

blacks and Hispanics in executive positions. <p>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>WHY ME?</B><P>



<font size=5>W</font>HEN all is said and done, however, one objection to affirmative action is

unanswerable on its own terms, and that is the objection of the individual who

says, "Why me? Sure, discrimination has persisted for many years, and I

acknowledge that the damage done has not been removed by changes in the law.

But why me? I didn't own slaves; I didn't vote to keep people on the back of

the bus; I didn't turn water hoses on civil-rights marchers. Why, then, should

I be the one who doesn't get the job or who doesn't get the scholarship or who

gets bumped back to the waiting list?"<p>



I sympathize with this feeling, if only because in a small way I have had the

experience that produces it. I was recently nominated for an administrative

post at a large university. Early signs were encouraging, but after an interval

I received official notice that I would not be included at the next level of

consideration, and subsequently I was told unofficially that at some point a

decision had been made to look only in the direction of women and minorities.

Although I was disappointed, I did not conclude that the situation was

"unfair," because the policy was obviously not directed at me--at no point in

the proceedings did someone say, "Let's find a way to rule out Stanley Fish."

Nor was it directed even at persons of my race and sex--the policy was not

intended to disenfranchise white males. Rather, the policy was driven by other

considerations, and it was only as a by-product of those considerations--not as

the main goal--that white males like me were rejected. Given that the

institution in question has a high percentage of minority students, a very low

percentage of minority faculty, and an even lower percentage of minority

administrators, it made perfect sense to focus on women and minority

candidates, and within that sense, not as the result of prejudice, my whiteness

and maleness became disqualifications.<p>



I can hear the objection in advance: "What's the difference? Unfair is unfair:

you didn't get the job; you didn't even get on the short list." The difference

is not in the outcome but in the ways of thinking that led up to the outcome.

It is the difference between an unfairness that befalls one as the unintended

effect of a policy rationally conceived and an unfairness that is pursued as an

end in itself. It is the difference between the awful unfairness of Nazi

extermination camps and the unfairness to Palestinian Arabs that arose from,

but was not the chief purpose of, the founding of a Jewish state.<p>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>THE NEW BIGOTRY</B><P>



<font size=5>T</font>HE point is not a difficult one, but it is difficult to see when the

unfairness scenarios are presented as simple contrasts between two

decontextualized persons who emerge from nowhere to contend for a job or a

place in a freshman class. Here is student A; he has a board score of 1,300.

And here is student B; her board score is only 1,200, yet she is admitted and A

is rejected. Is that fair? Given the minimal information provided, the answer

is of course no. But if we expand our horizons and consider fairness in

relation to the cultural and institutional histories that have brought the two

students to this point, histories that weigh on them even if they are not the

histories' authors, then both the question and the answer suddenly grow more

complicated.<p>



The sleight-of-hand logic that first abstracts events from history and then

assesses them from behind a veil of willed ignorance gains some of its

plausibility from another key word in the anti-affirmative-action lexicon. That

word is "individual," as in "The American way is to focus on the rights of

individuals rather than groups." Now, "individual" and "individualism" have

been honorable words in the American political vocabulary, and they have often

been well employed in the fight against various tyrannies. But like any other

word or concept, individualism can be perverted to serve ends the opposite of

those it originally served, and this is what has happened when in the name of

individual rights, millions of individuals are enjoined from redressing

historically documented wrongs. How is this managed? Largely in the same way

that the invocation of fairness is used to legitimize an institutionalized

inequality. First one says, in the most solemn of tones, that the protection of

individual rights is the chief obligation of society. Then one defines

individuals as souls sent into the world with equal entitlements as guaranteed

either by their Creator or by the Constitution. Then one pretends that nothing

has happened to them since they stepped onto the world's stage. And then one

says of these carefully denatured souls that they will all be treated in the

same way, irrespective of any of the differences that history has produced.

Bizarre as it may seem, individualism in this argument turns out to mean that

everyone is or should be the same. This dismissal of individual difference in

the name of the individual would be funny were its consequences not so serious:

it is the mechanism by which imbalances and inequities suffered by millions of

people through no fault of their own can be sanitized and even celebrated as

the natural workings of unfettered democracy.<p>



"Individualism," "fairness," "merit"--these three words are continually

misappropriated by bigots who have learned that they need not put on a white

hood or bar access to the ballot box in order to secure their ends. Rather,

they need only clothe themselves in a vocabulary plucked from its historical

context and made into the justification for attitudes and policies they would

not acknowledge if frankly named.<p>

Sedding, and Forbes Watson'sFlowers and Gardens, the second edition of a book which endeared itself toplant-lovers of thirty years ago. The books are written from widely differingstandpoints, but each reflects the man: the winsomeness of John Sedding's sunnypersonality and the rare sweetness and unworldliness of Forbes Watson'scharacter are alike touched with that indefinable grace wherewith the gardensare ever blessing back those who love them aright. <p><p>To leave the din and clatter of the streets, the clang of the trolley cars, thecries of the venders, and all the jarring noises of this workaday world, andlose one's self in such a book as that of John Sedding's, is indeed a rest untothe soul: to feel the dreamy charm and half-forgotten fragrance of the oldgardens and breathe a Herrick atmosphere<p>"Of brooks, of blossoms, birds and bowers,"<p>a book where it is a matter of course to meet Gower and Andrew Marvell, and asurprise to chance upon a bit of Browning; where Sir William Temple dissertatesupon "The perfectest figure of a Garden I ever saw, either at Home or Abroad,"and Evelyn gives advice on terraces; where Lady Mary Wortley Montagu forgetsher neuralgia and her quarrel with Pope, although he is not two chapters off,and discourses amiably of the Giardino Jiusti, and even crusty Horace Walpoledrops his misanthropy for the moment, and does a service which makes thegarden-lover always his debtor.<p><p>Like these old-time worthies who chat and mingle so congenially in his pages,Sedding was not a gardener by profession: he was an architect, whose work wasblest with both originality and artistic quality, an artist with a passionatelove for studying flower and leaf. For garden-making is the craft of crafts forthe artist-amateur. "Thus, if I make a garden," writes Sedding, "I need notprint a line, nor conjure with the painter's tools to prove myself anartist...Whilst in other spheres of labor the greater part of our life's toiland moil will of a surety end, as the wise man predicted, in vanity andvexation of spirit, here is instant physical refreshment in the work the gardenentails, and, in the end, our labor will be crowned with flowers."<p><p>"A garden is a place where these two whilom foes--Nature and Man--patch up apeace for the nonce. Outside the garden precincts--in the furrowed field, inthe forest, the quarry, the mine, out upon the broad seas--the feud stillprevails that began when our first parents found themselves on the wrong sideof the gate of Paradise."<p><p>"'There be delights,'" quotes Sedding, "'that will fetch the day about from sunto sun and rock the tedious year as in a delightful dream.'...For a garden isArcady brought home. It is man's bit of gaudy make-believe--his well-disguisedfiction of an unvexed Paradise...a world where gayety knows no eclipse andwinter and rough weather are held at bay."<p><p>But this first chapter with its page after page of garden rhapsody is by way ofinvocation. There are quaint designs for formal gardens with their sundials andclipped yew hedges, an admirable historical sketch of English garden-craft, thework of the old masters, Bacon, Evelyn, and Temple; the sad record of the earlyeighteenth century when Mr. Brown, in the name of landscape gardening andnature, demolished the ancient avenues and pleasure grounds with a completenesswhich would have made Spenser's Sir Guyon think of his efforts in Acrasia'sbower and blush for incompetence: not even Sir Walter Raleigh's garden wasspared "unparalleled by anie in these partes," and as an advertising agentblazons his wares on the silent boulders, Mr. Brown's name was writ large forposterity on English gardening. "All in CAPITALS," to quote Dr. Young.<p><p>It is the old-fashioned garden, "that piece of hoarded loveliness" as he callsit, which holds Sedding's allegiance: the garden of the men who wrote andwrought when English poetry and English garden-craft were in their springtime,where contentions had not entered in. He finds excellent poetic backing for hislove of confessed art in a garden, intrenching himself behind two suchnature-lovers and notable gardeners as Wordsworth and Sir Walter Scott.<p><p>Indeed, the kinship between garden-craft and poetry is often overlooked; "wehave only to turn to the old poets and note how the texture of the speech--thegroundwork of the thought--is saturated through and through with gardenimagery," for garden-craft is only another medium of expression for the art ofthe period: even in the Jacobean garden, "we have much the same quips andcranks, the same quaint power of metrical changes, playful fancy of the poetryof Herbert, Vaughan, Herrick, and Donne."<p><p>Perhaps the most potent charm of the book, as of the Canterbury Pilgrimage, isin the goodly company and the pleasure of finding, like Chaucer, <p>     "That I was of hir felawshipe anon,"<p>"to be brought to old Lawson's state of simple ravishment, 'What moredelightsome than an infinite varietie of sweet-smelling flowers? decking withsundry colors the green mantle of the Earth, coloring not onely the earth, butdecking the ayre, and sweetning every breath and spirit;'...to be inoculatedwith old Gerarde of the garden-mania as he bursts forth, 'Go forward in thename of God: graffe, set, plante, nourishe up trees in every corner of yourgrounde.'"<p><p>The landscape architect may look askance at some of Sedding's authorities, notonly such garden-masters as Bacon, Temple, Evelyn, or the later gardeners ofrepute, Gilpin and Repton, or Loudon of the "Gardenesque School," but More, SirJoshua, Sir Walter, Elia, Tennyson, William Morris, and Wordsworth, who wasSedding's ideal gardener. If, as Ruskin says, an architect should be a painterand a sculptor, a landscape architect should be an artist and a poet also, withthe poet's imagination and the gift of seeing "the wonders that may be." "To mymind," writes Sedding, "a garden is the outward and visible sign of a man'sinnate love of loveliness." Now if a man have not this love of loveliness,which is the soul of poetry, his garden-craft profiteth him nothing.<p><p>Although it is of English gardening that Mr. Sedding writes, the Americanlandscape architect will find excellent planting hints if he does not object to"precepts wrapped in a pretty metaphor," and there is this catholic advice forthe amateur, "Put all the beauty and delightsomeness you can into your garden,get all the beauty and delight you can out of your garden, never minding alittle mad want of balance, and think of the proprieties afterwards!" while heturns to the "Other Side," and in his Plea for Savagery makes charming excusefor those of us to whom the wilderness is dearer and better than the best ofgardens, the sweet and blessed country which, however the title deeds run,belongs by birthright to the shy wood folk.<p><p>Very pleasant is the glimpse Mr. Russell gives in his memoir of the man JohnSedding,--the sunshiny, helpful presence among the young art students, theready friendliness which was the outer garment of a deeply religious nature,the earnest work, and after the day's work the delights of gardening, "thehappiest of homes and the sweetest of wives," the grave on the sunny slope ofthe little Kentish churchyard where, under the quiet elms, John Sedding andthis "sweetest of wives" are together:--<p>     "'T is fit One Flesh One House should have<p>     One Tombe, One Epitaph, One Grave;<p>     And they that lived and loved either<p>     Should dye, and Lye and sleep together."<p><p>Unlike Garden-Craft, there is little theory in Flowers and Gardens, and thepoetry of the book lies in the rarely beautiful flower studies, the chapters onVegetation and the Withering of Plants, while the garden papers are ratherdesultory prose. The author, who died in early manhood, was a physician byprofession, a botanist by taste and inheritance, and more than this deeply andintensely a flower-lover, which the botanist does not always nor of necessityinclude. Did not Karshish, who was botanist enough to notice<p>          "on the margin of a pool<p>     Blue-flowering borage, the Aleppo sort,"<p><p>express his astonishment that Lazarus should so love "the very flowers of thefield"? Forbes Watson from his youth up was preeminently and passionately alover of flowers,--not for the lust of the eye, nor for the pride of thecollector, not for gracing the house with their "endearing young charms," norgiving color and fragrance to the gardens,--he loved each for its "own dearloveliness."<p><p>To his mind there was more to be learned of a plant that its physicalstructure,--there was its expression, its peculiar beauty: "What is the dearestand the deepest in the flower," he wrote, "is best seen when that glower isobserved alone." It was of this "dearest and deepest" element that ForbesWatson sought to learn, studying with scrupulous care of the smallest detail,with unwearying patience, one and another of the common every-day flowers,until as Shelley says,--<p><p>     "The soul of its beauty and love lay bare,"<p><p>and he found there is no curve of petal, no line of leaf nor touch of color,that has not only its part to play in the physical life, but is essential tothe attainment of its individual beauty.<p><p>The twelve Studies in Plant Beauty, which comprise the first part of the book,show a rare delicacy of observation, a poetic insight in the <p>     "deeper meanings of what roses say,"<p><p>that not even Ruskin exceeded, and are touched beside with thatother-worldliness one might look to find in writing done during an illnesswhich a man knew to be his last.<p><p>It would be a pleasure to quote his analysis of the Yellow Crocus with its tinymirror-like devices for flashing and holding the sunlight, or the Cowslip, orhis finely delicate study of the Snowdrop, or the poetic interpretation of thePurple Crocus's expression; but these are too long to be given in full, andwithout the complete analysis quotations if not rendered meaningless would besadly marred, and the studies are too beautiful for such spoiling.<p><p>To a man who loved flowers after this manner, dwelt on their beauty with such alingering tenderness, it is easy to understand that the gardener's use of themseemed sometimes a desecration; flowers and leaves speckled and spotted whosechief claim to attention was novelty. "Look at that scarlet geranium," hewrites, "whose edges are broadly buttered round with cream color (I can use noother term which will express the vulgarity of the effect); consider first theharshness of the leaf coloring in itself, then its want of relation to theform, and finally, what a degradation this is of the clear, beautiful, andrestful contrast which we find in the plain scarlet geranium; and then you askyourself what this taste can be where this is not only tolerated, butadmired."<p><p>It was because of his love of the individual flower that Forbes Watson fought agood fight against the carpet beds that thirty years ago were in their glory,and considered the acme of garden perfection,--the greatest blare of color, thegreatest excellence (which suggests the ideal of the Vicar's family in anotherart, when Olivia declares admiringly that the Squire can sing "louder than hermaster").<p><p>"Our flower beds," he wrote indignantly, "are considered mere masses of colorinstead of an assemblage of living beings,--the plant is never old, neveryoung, it degenerates into a colored ornament."<p><p>The carpet beds, it is to be hoped, have passed away with that other carpetwork of an earlier generation which Mr. Jameson declared so immoral; still,that popular feminine adornment, the huge bunch of violets is only another formof the same barbarism; nothing could be more utterly alien to the character andindividuality of this dear, shadow-loving, poet's flower, and here is alandscape architect whose advertisement in one of the current magazines runs inthis fashion: "There is no more useful garden material than the so-called Dutchbulbs, hyacinths, crocuses, narcissi," and the like, none which yield a largerreturn "for so small an expenditure of time and money!" Alas for theflowers!--the narcissi that Shelley loved--the dainty crocuses that lift theirfaces to the doubtful sun with such a childlike confidence; they have falleninto the hands of the Philistines; how they must sigh for Content in a Gardenof Mrs. Wheeler's making, where the flowers have their preferences consulted,are loved and petted and praised as flowers should be, make room for oneanother in the garden beds with gracious courtesy, and are given delightfulintroduction to the world in the charming pages of her little volume where thesense of green things creeps into the very pages.<p><p>"None," Forbes Watson declares,-- "none can have a healthy love for flowersunless he loves the wild ones." It is on this study of the wild flowers that heinsists, not only for their own sake, although they give ample recompense, butbecause it is only in this way that the eye may be kept single, that one canknow the true beauty from the false, nor go after strange gods and sacrificefor more size and sensuousness the rarer, finer qualities of harmony and purityof form. <p><p>If Forbes Watson thought of the hurrying, restless generation, the men andwomen nerve-distracted, careful and troubled about many things, or wearied withpleasures "daubed with cost," as Bacon says,--the things which make for "stateand magnificence, but are nothing to the true pleasure of a garden,"--who haveeyes, but not for the flowers, he might have felt with the prophet when hisservant was anxious and distressed because he saw not the heavenly vision.<p><p>"My master how shall we do?" and Elisha prayed unto the Lord and said, "Lord, Ipray thee, open his eyes."<p>						<!--DROPCAP-->													<!--INSERT TEXT UP TO													HERE--></blockquote>												<!-- end article --><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br>			<!--NAVIGATION BUTTONS--><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

Jay Monaghan's' *Lincoln Bibliography* requires 1,079 pages merely tolist the books and pamphlets published before 1939, when even the experts lostcount. On library shelves the multi-volumed biographies by Nicolay and Hay,Sandburg, and Randall and Current stand cover to cover with *Lincoln NeverSmoked a Cigarette* and *Abraham Lincoln on the Coming of the CaterpillarTractor*. Every February sees a fresh flood of Lincoln Day oratory and verse.<p><p><p>This extraordinary interest in the details of Lincoln's life seems the moreastonishing in light of his low contemporary standing. His associates were surethere were greater figures in their era; usually they had at least one suchperson in mind--and close at home at that. Lincoln they thought a simple Susan,a baboon, an aimless punster, a smutty joker. He left the highway of principleto pursue the devious paths of expediency. A "huckster in politics," sneeredWendell Phillips, "a first-rate second-rate man." A Springfield neighbor calledhim "The craftiest and most dishonest politician that ever disgraced an officein America." "If I wanted to paint a despot, a man perfectly regardless ofevery constitutional right of the people," cried Saulsbury of Delaware in theSenate, "I would paint the hideous form of Abraham Lincoln...."<p><p><p>Not even assassination at once translated Lincoln into sainthood. "The deceaseof Mr. Lincoln is a great national bereavement," conceded Representative J. M.Ashley of Ohio, "but I am not so sure it is so much of a national loss." Withineight hours of his murder Republican Congressmen in secret caucus agreed that"his death is a godsend to our cause." Andrew Johnson, they believed, wouldcarry through the proposed social revolution in the South which theconciliatory Lincoln had blocked. Now, crowed Ben Wade, "there will be notrouble running the government."<p><p><p>But politicians of all parties were apparently startled by the extent of thenational grief over Lincoln, and, politician-like, they decided to capitalizeupon it. Democrats were, of course, under a handicap, but a surprising numberof them now discovered that they had really heartily endorsed the Lincolnprogram. That vicious Copperhead sheet the Chicago *Times* discerned"indications of the last few days of [Lincoln's] life that he might command[Democratic] support on the close of the war," and Clement L. Vallandighamreported that even the peace men had begun "to turn toward Lincoln fordeliverance."<p><p><p>The Republicans' claim to Lincoln was surely somewhat more plausible, and,being in a majority in Congress, they were able to make it good by staging athree-week funeral procession, witnessed by millions of persons, in whichLincoln's body was dragged by special train, to the accompaniment of mourningbells and wailing choirs, through the principal cities of the North. DemocratCharles Mason of Iowa thought the whole affair a political trick, like the"crafty skill of Mark Anthony [sic] in displaying to the Roman people thebloody mantle of Caesar." Republican Radicals, he felt, in seeking a vindictivepeace and a new social order for the South, wanted "to make...political capitalout of the murder. They wish to strengthen their hands and brutalize the heartsof the Northern people till there shall be general concurrence in all measuresof confiscation and extermination...."<p><p><p>That was precisely what the Radicals intended and did. Their Lincoln eulogieswere carefully directed toward proving that Democrats had been in partresponsible for Lincoln's death and toward demonstrating that Negro suffragewas necessary in order to prevent the traitors from returning to power. In hisLincoln oration in Boston, Charles Sumner, theorist for the Radical faction,carefully interjected a strong plea for Negro enfranchisement, which his partyfriends found "very cunning."<p><p><p>Meanwhile, a third contender for the Lincolnian mantle appeared in the personof Andrew Johnson, the new President. After a momentary aberration in which heseemed more radical than the Radicals, Johnson adopted a conciliatory policytoward the South, granting general amnesty and exacting neither confiscation ofproperty nor Negro suffrage. All this in the eyes of the Radicals was badenough, but he did it all in the name of Lincoln. William H. Seward, whocontinued as Secretary of State, assured all comers that the Johnsonreconstruction plans "grew during the administration of Mr. Lincoln," and inhis proclamations setting up provisional governments in the South, thePresident specifically referred to Lincoln's earlier actions as hisprecedents.<p><p><p>Republican Radicals were furious. Johnson they considered a traitor, all themore dangerous because he threatened to divert the idolization of Lincoln, socarefully fostered by the Radicals, into support of an anti-radical program."Is there no way to arrest the insane course of the President...?" groanedThaddeus Stevens.<p><p><p>There was a way, and it is not too much of an oversimplification to regard theensuing struggle between President and Congress as a ghoulish tugging atLincoln's shroud; both parties needed to identify Lincoln with their respectivereconstruction programs. It was a vindictive quarrel, and shrill denunciationby the one faction provoked harsher abuse from the other. Johnson, publiclybranding Sumner, Stevens, and Wendell Phillips as "opposed to the fundamentalprinciples of this government," asked petulantly: "Are [they]...notsatisfied...with one martyr? Does not the blood of Lincoln appease[their]...vengeance and wrath...?" And Ben Butler, speaking for the Radicalsthus accused, replied by impeaching the President before the Senate: "By murdermost foul...[Johnson] succeeded to the Presidency, and is the elect of anassassin to that high office...." In the Republican national convention of 1868it was openly charged that "the treachery of Andrew Johnson...cost us the lifeof Abraham Lincoln."<p><p>The rival parties of the Reconstruction era were not, of course, historiansquibbling over a footnote. They were politicians seeking power, and theyinvoked Lincoln's name to win votes. Among the Negroes of the South they knewthat identification with Lincoln might assure a candidate of victory. InLexington, South Carolina, for instance, the fall elections of 1867 wereexpected to be close, and Radicals felt that they must carry the entire Negrovote. Proudly the ward heeler wrote Charles Sumner of their methods. TheRepublicans secretly printed their own ballots, to be distributed on the day ofthe election, which "were to contain a sign...and by it, we hoped to conquer.""I inclose a ticket," he continued, "and you will see the sign--no less thanAbraham Lincoln, the martyr to Liberty--and no colored man dared refuse it--nordid one single one fail to vote it.... When our ticket distributers...showedtheir tickets with the face of Lincoln, their eyes beamed with gratitude, andone old worn out freedman exclaimed 'Tank God, I tought he would send you tous!'"<p><p><p>In the Northern states Republican use of the Lincoln symbol was somewhat moreliterate but scarcely less emotional. During the campaign of 1868, Edwin M.Stanton, whose conversion to Lincolnian views might be termed posthumous, swepthis Pennsylvania audiences for Grant by reading the Gettysburg address. Then hesaid, tearfully: "That is the voice of God speaking through the lips of AbrahamLincoln...You hear the voice of Father Abraham here tonight. Did he die invain?...Let us here, every one, with uplifted hand, declare before Almighty Godthat the precious gift of this great heritage, consecrated in the blood of oursoldiers, shall never perish from the earth. Now--" and he uplifted his hands"all hands to God. I SWEAR IT!" After which his auditors all presumably wentout and voted Republican.<p><p><p><font size=4><b>II.</b></font><p><p>After Johnson was defeated, it seemed to be Lincoln and the Republican party,one and inseparable. Other parties, of course, could revere and admire Lincolnas a great American, but it was clear to the right-thinking that the GreatMartyr was Republican property. In periodical campaign addresses Republicansinvoked the Great Emancipator to bless the good cause and to smite theunrighteous. To some these terms might need definition, but not to Republicans.Lincoln, they were sure, would favor the high tariff, urge the annexation ofthe Philippines; oppose greenbackism, socialism, populism, and labor unions;fight the income tax; and assail the League of Nations and the World Court.<p><p><p>Every four years Republican hopefuls sought--and presumably secured Lincoln'sendorsement. According to the campaign literature, Lincoln invariably boremarked physical or moral resemblance to the party's candidates, including suchunlikely persons as William McKinley, William Howard Taft, and Calvin Coolidge.Year after year Republican politicos reviewed their party's lineage in LincolnDay addresses that the world has little noted nor long remembered. One oration,however, deserves to be treasured--that of Warren G. Harding, commencing:"Destiny made Lincoln the agency of fulfillment, held the inherited covenantinviolate and gave him to the ages. No words can magnify or worship glorify."As W. S. Gilbert observes, "The meaning doesn't matter if it's only idlechatter of a transcendental kind."<p><p><p>The Lincoln cult in literature was closely connected with this party tradition.The laudatory Lincoln biographies--those of Holland, Nicolay and Hay, and thelike--were written by men who firmly believed that, next to the dog, theRepublican party was man's best friend. Orated George S. Boutwell, somewhatinaccurately: "The Republican Party gave to Mr. Lincoln the opportunity onwhich his fame rests, and his fame is the inheritance of the Republicanparty.... When we set forth the character and services of Mr. Lincoln we setforth as well the claims of the Republican party to the gratitude andconfidence of the country...."<p><p><p>Not until 1887 did the party formally begin holding annual rallies on February12. By that time the outlines of the Lincoln portrait were fading in even themost tenacious Republican memory; and a yearly banquet offered the dualopportunity to retouch the portrait and to refill the party treasury. Thisuseful custom rapidly spread, and today most major Republican congregationshold dinners on Lincoln's birthday. Every year these somewhat grim rites ofearly spring are reported in the newspapers, and drearier reading it would behard to find. Take, for instance, the seventeenth annual Lincoln Day dinner ofthe New York Republican Club, held at the Waldorf-Astoria in 1903. Some fivehundred men attended--their wives were segregated in those happy, bygonedays--and ate the seven-course dinner. As the menu was in French, Lincolnprobably could not have known what was served; and as the food, as is usual atbanquets, was reported atrocious, he perhaps would not have wished to. Laterthe "handsomely gowned" women were permitted to join their spouses, electricityilluminated the figure of an elephant behind the speakers' table, and Lincoln'sspirit was invoked to be present. The presiding officer read regrets fromdignitaries unable to attend--Senators, Supreme Court Justices, party bigwigs.President Theodore Roosevelt wrote: "I feel that not merely the RepublicanParty, but all believers in the country, should do everything in their power tokeep alive the memory of Abraham Lincoln." That was about the only nonpartisannote of the evening.<p><p><p>There followed--as always--addresses. The chief speaker was former GovernorFrank S. Black of New York, chosen for his alleged resemblance to Lincoln."There are subjects," he began, "upon which nothing new can be said"--but thisdid not deter him from continuing. His theme was the advantage of Lincoln'spoverty. "The child may shiver in the fury of the blast which no maternaltenderness can shield him from, but he may feel a helpless tear drop upon hischeek which will keep him warm till the snows of time have covered his hair."His well-clad auditors, safe from the wintry blast, applauded. "It is notwealth that counts in the making of the world, but character....Give me the hutthat is small enough, the poverty that is deep enough, the love that is greatenough, and I will raise from them the best there is in human character." Againhis hearers, who, after all, were considerably poorer for their attendance atthis gathering, applauded the virtues of poverty.<p><p><p>After some minutes--a good many minutes--more of this, a Vermont judge spoke onLincoln and Wendell Phillips. Then Congressman Cushman of Washington followedon "Abraham Lincoln and the Northwest," concluding: "And with no sordid thoughtof gain for myself or for my party, I say that it beats in every throb of myheart tonight that the greatest good, the grandest future, and the mostimmortal destiny of our nation lies [sic] with the Republican Party." AnotherCongressman then talked about "Lincoln's War Secretary," but his remarks havefortunately not been preserved. Late at night, in various stages of numbnessthe guests escaped, clutching their sacred relics of the reincarnation they hadjust witnessed--watch fobs showing Lincoln swinging a woodman's mallet.<p><p><p><font size=4><b>III.</font></b><p><p>For decades the Republican claim to Lincoln so repeatedly asserted wentvirtually unquestioned. Although minor parties from time to time jeered that aMcKinley or a Coolidge had hardly the physique for a rail-splitter, Democratsfor the most part respected the Republican title. Grover Cleveland, forinstance, making a tour of the Middle West in 1887, carefully avoided a stop atSpringfield, Illinois, not because he lacked admiration for Lincoln but becausehe felt that the Lincoln shrines were Republican preserves. Woodrow Wilson didmake Lincoln Day speeches--and to Democrats, at that--but he admitted the priorRepublican claim by beginning: "I sometimes think it a singular circumstancethat the present Republican party should have sprung from Lincoln, but that isone of the mysteries of Providence...."<p><p><p>In 1912, however, Lincoln became a partisan issue. Denying any wish to "treat[Lincoln's] name as a mere party symbol" President Taft claimed Lincoln as aregular who would never ally himself with Theodore Roosevelt's Progressives."Lincoln knew no such word as insurgent," former Congressman Charles F. Scottechoed his chief, "for it never entered his mind to consider himself moreimportant than his principles." But Theodore Roosevelt insisted that Lincolnwas on his side: "The official leaders of the Republican party today are thespiritual heirs of the men who warred against Lincoln, who railed at him as arevolutionist,...who accused him of being a radical, an innovator, an opponentof the Constitution, and an enemy of property." By 1916, however, in Lincoln'sname, Roosevelt urged his Progressive following to return to the regular partyranks; Lincoln had come home.<p><p><p>It was not until 1932 that another serious effort was made to raid theRepublican closet and steal the stovepipe hat. Harassed Herbert Hoover, makingthe traditional pilgrimage to Springfield, likened himself to Lincoln in thedark days of 1864 and found victory over the depression just a matter offighting it out on this line if it took all summer. Traditionally Democrats hadregarded such oratory as an exclusively Republican prerogative, but now a newspirit had entered that party. James A. Farley piously announced himself"shocked" at Hoover's partisan use of the Lincoln symbol, and Gifford Pinchotdeclared that Lincoln in these sad days "would not get to first base" with theRepublican party on "his platform of human rights." It was even suggested thatcampaigning Governor Franklin Roosevelt might make an address at Lincoln'stomb, a report that caused cries of "sacrilege" among Springfield Republicans,one of whom threatened an injunction to stop this Democratic outrage.<p><p><p>Mr. Roosevelt did not then speak as Lincoln's successor, but he was veryshortly to assume the mantle of the Great Emancipator. In fact, he seemed torummage through the clothes closet of American history and take his pick ofgarments. He understood what was meant by "the usable past." The notion thatLincoln was a Republican, President Roosevelt dismissed as an idea as outmodedas the horse and buggy, the balanced budget, and the nine-man Supreme Court.His was the new interpretation of history. "Does anyone maintain that theRepublican party from 1868 to 1938 (with the possible exception of a few yearsunder Theodore Roosevelt) was the party of Abraham Lincoln?" he queried.Lincoln he named along with Jefferson and Jackson and Wilson (Henry Wallace wasto add the prophet Amos and the Boston Tea Party mob) as a father of the NewDeal.<p><p><p>Repeatedly the New Dealers urged their claim to the Lincoln tradition. MayorFiorello La Guardia was positive that present-day Republicans "have nothing incommon" with Lincoln. Quite the contrary. Was it not Lincoln who said "thelegitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whateverthey need to have done, but cannot do for themselves, in their separate andindividual capacities"? Mr. Roosevelt was so taken with this apparentjustification of the New Deal's economic policies that he quoted the statementon at least three occasions. On specific issues Democrats cited Lincoln withdevastating effectiveness. Republicans who reacted with horror to PresidentRoosevelt's denunciation of the Supreme Court were reminded by Attorney GeneralHomer Cummings that Lincoln had attacked the Court's Dred Scott decision, andwhen Mr. Roosevelt defended his court-packing scheme, he observed that Lincolnalso had increased the number of Supreme Court justices.<p><p><p>Not surprisingly, most Republicans were irate at this Democratic effort to getin on their act. Very few would agree with Wendell Willkie, who deplored allpartisan use of national heroes and in effect urged an armistice. "...NeitherMr. Roosevelt nor I myself are great men," he observed, in what was undoubtedlyone of the worst guesses in recent history. "Neither of us has demonstrated anyof the qualities of greatness...[of] Washington or Lincoln....Therefore, in thediscussions of an issue of a campaign,...it will do us no good to draw thesehistorical illusions." (The printer spelled it so--a Democrat, no doubt.) "Thequestion is...What does he believe, and what do I believe?"<p><p><p>But most Republicans were not so willing to surrender their political treasure.The New Deal's claim to Lincoln was a dirty Roosevelt trick, they snarled. Yearafter year, during the dark New Deal days, Republicans continued to rally onLincoln's birthday, and they "sacrificed thousands of banquet chickens to thememory of their patron saint and their speakers said Roosevelt was becoming adictator." In 1939, for instance, Herbert Hoover vas willingly recalled from anunwilling retirement to address the Waldorf Astoria dinner and to rebuke theDemocrats for riding on the Republican range. "Whatever this New Deal systemis," the ex-President snapped, "it is certain that it did not come from AbrahamLincoln." Other Republicans were positive that Lincoln would oppose the highincome tax, social security, the court-reorganization scheme, aid to Britain,and a third term. Lincoln would especially have detested the un-Americanism ofthe New Deal, declared Colonel Robert R. McCormick of the Chicago Tribune."Dictatorship threatens to engulf the liberties of the American people," theColonel darkly warned. "A band of conspirators including one Felix Frankfurter,like Adolf Hitler, born an Austrian, impregnated with the historic doctrine ofAustrian absolutism, plans to inflict this Oriental atrocity upon ourRepublican people. The Congress of the United States has been corrupted withbribes....Four billion eight hundred million dollars...has been appropriated tocorrupt the electors. The unscrupulous...Jim Farley is at work behind thesmiling mask of Franklin Roosevelt to bring the end of self-government in theworld....In this grave moment, I recall to you these words of AbrahamLincoln...."<p><p><p><font size=4><b>IV.</font></b><p><p>Despite these plaintive efforts to reclaim him, Lincoln was by now everybody'sgrandfather. No reputable political organization could omit a reference to theGreat Emancipator, nor could the disreputable ones. The Communist party beganholding Lincoln-Lenin rallies in February, and even today the partyheadquarters in New York is adorned with Lincoln's photographs. Neither the"Republican-Liberty League-Hearst combination" nor the Democratic party "whosemain base is the reactionary Solid South," was the legitimate heir of Lincoln,claimed Earl Browder. "The times call again for a Lincoln, for a new party, fora new program." At the same time that he was a Communist, Lincoln was also avegetarian, a socialist, a prohibitionist, a greenbacker, and a proponent ofUnion Now.<p><p><p>In the 1948 election, everybody was for Lincoln. Dixiecrats remembered thatLincoln, as a fellow Southerner, preferred letting the race problem work itselfout. Henry Wallace's Progressives asserted that they were heirs of Jefferson,Jackson, and Lincoln. Thomas E. Dewey, according to his running-mate, bore astriking resemblance to Lincoln--spiritual rather than physical, onejudges--and President Truman claimed that if Lincoln were alive, he would be aDemocrat. Finally Lincoln has become a nonpartisan, nonsectional hero. Itseems, as Congressman Everett Dirksen solemnly assured his Republicancolleagues, that these days the first task of a politician is "to get rightwith...Lincoln."<p><p><p>Obviously all this ballyhoo has had something to do with the continuallygrowing Lincoln legend, but it alone is not sufficient explanation. Other partygreats have been cited and discarded. It is difficult to imagine anyone in the1950's asking: "What would Charles Sumner do if he were here today?" One reasonis that it is perfectly simple to ascertain what Sumner would do. Perhaps thesecret of Lincoln's continuing vogue is his essential ambiguity. He can becited on all sides of all questions. "My policy," he used to say, "is to haveno policy."<p><p><p>A moralist may deplore Lincoln's noncommittal attitude, but it should beremembered that this fundamental opportunism is characteristic of majorAmerican political leaders from Jefferson to Franklin D. Roosevelt. Our greatPresidents have joyously played the political piano by ear, making up themelody as they went. At only one time have rigid ideologists dominated ournational government--the Sumners of the North, the Jefferson Davises of theSouth--and the result was near disaster. Today badly frightened ifwell-intentioned citizens are calling upon historians and teachers to draw up arigid credo for Americanism, to teach "American values." To do so is to forgetLincoln's nonideological approach. In our age of anxiety it is pertinent toremember that our most enduring political symbolism derives from Lincoln, whoseone dogma was an absence of dogma.<p></blockquote><p><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../index.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1956 by David Donald.

	<font size=5>I</font> am surprised that <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> would print an article written
by U.S. Department of Energy employees advertising DOE programs: "Mideast Oil
Forever?" by Joseph J. Romm and Charles B. Curtis (April <i>Atlantic</i>). I
agree that we are "sleepwalking" into what will become a significant energy
shortage by 2020. However, the reason that we can't plan ahead and make
significant progress on alternative energy sources is that we as a nation
insist on believing that the world is as we wish it were rather than as it
actually is, so we insist that soft energy sources will be sufficient.<p>

Let's take wind power and photovoltaic (solar) cells as examples. The authors
state that with continued public-private partnership in technology advancement,
wind could hit three cents per kilowatt-hour by 2020. Good grief, that's
twenty-four years away! If we can travel to the moon, how is it we can't make a
competitive wind-power machine? How many hundreds of millions of R&amp;D
dollars are we talking about spending on this technology in the next
twenty-five years? What are we basing this prediction on--blades made of
"miraculem" and superconducting generators? Maybe there is a more fundamental
problem.<p>

As for photovoltaic cells, the authors indicate that the amount of power sold
worldwide has grown from four to eighty megawatts over the past sixteen years
and that after 2030 sales could exceed $100 billion. To start with, eighty
megawatts is nothing in the scheme of things, and the year 2030 is so far away
that one can only conclude that PVs simply won't be competitive until the world
goes through a severe oil shock after oil production peaks. This means that the
U.S. consumer will have to suffer a significant increase in his electricity
bill before solar becomes attractive. We could do this tomorrow by placing a
large tax on oil, gas, and coal in accordance with their negative environmental
impacts. Although this might be an appropriate action, I would rather focus on
development in areas that can produce results that will not cause the cost of
electricity to quadruple and the economy to go into a tailspin.<p><p>

	<font size=5>I</font>n your otherwise excellent article about renewable 
	energy technologies we were surprised to find no mention of geothermal 
	heating and cooling technology.  This technology, by taking advantage 
	of the earth's constant moderate temperature just below the surface, 
	efficiently captures heat in winter and deposits it in the summer.  The 
	emerging geothermal industry creates high-skill employment, does not 
	pollute the air, has a short payback period, incurs low operating costs 
	compared with conventional systems, and saves energy dollars.  Richard 
	Stockton College, home of the largest closed-loop geothermal system in 
	the world, has saved more than 25 percent annually on heating and 
	cooling bills for its academic buildings.  Geothermal is one more way 
	to reduce oil dependency and is deserving of short-term economic 
	nurturing by the federal as well as state governments.  In fact, the 
	DOE and the EPA have worked in partnership with the electric-utilities 
	industry and manufacturers to promote geothermal technology, with the 
	hope of investing $100 million to bring this technology into the 
	mainstream by the year 2000.<p>

	<font size=5>I</font>n "Mideast Oil Forever?" Joseph J. Romm and 
	Charles B. Curtis warn that congressional budget-cutters threaten to 
	end America's leadership in new energy technologies that protect the 
	environment and limit dependency on oil from the unstable Persian Gulf 
	region.<p>

Although we agree with the article that environmental protection is crucial and
the risks of growing dependence on foreign oil are real, we disagree with the
article's focus on renewable sources of energy as the solution. Renewables
certainly have a role in America's distant energy future, but the best
near-term solution for bridging energy security and environmental
protection--with economic growth--is clean, economical, and abundant domestic
natural gas.<p>

Natural gas provides about 25 percent of the nation's energy needs today, while
renewables contribute only seven percent. The market share for renewables
cannot and will not change anytime in the next several decades, even with major
increases in government funding, which are required in the Shell scenario cited
in the article. Thus renewables can make very little contribution to reducing
oil imports or improving the environment in our lifetime. However, the American
Gas Association estimates that natural gas could replace one million barrels of
imported oil a day by 2000 and two million barrels a day by 2010, given a
concerted national effort to convert factories, homes, and particularly
vehicles to natural gas--and would simultaneously result in environmental
benefits.<p>

To offer a balanced view of the DOE's valuable research-and-development
program, the article needed to recognize the significant contributions that can
be made by its natural-gas programs, which have been underfunded for years. In
these times of budget constraints, the DOE should focus on research and
technology that show promise for reducing oil imports in the more immediate
future and offer a rapid payback for the American consumer. That means natural
gas.<p>

	<font size=5>S</font>earching for solutions that would allow us to continue to live in
sprawling communities and rely almost solely on single-occupant automobiles
simply perpetuates all the other problems that reliance on automobiles has
brought us. A variety of professionals are beginning to look at different ways
to build our cities, so that people can walk, bicycle, and use public transit,
instead of continuing with  highly wasteful land-use patterns. It is truly
unfortunate that much of the rest of the world is now seeking to emulate our
bad transportation-policy decisions of the past eighty years.<p>

Alternative fuels should be seen not as the ultimate goal but as a partial fix
in our search to move people without emphasizing one person, one vehicle. <p>

<br><br><br>

<font size=5>Y</font>our April cover story on the coming energy crisis was worth the year's
subscription price, if only for its comprehensive evaluation of how much oil
and gas the world will be consuming over the next forty years.<p>

On the supply side, though, the authors did not scratch the surface. The fact
is that the earth has not had its surface really scratched at this point in the
quest for liquid oil and gas. Of the 700,000 exploratory wells drilled on the
planet in the past 140 years, since oil was first discovered in Pennsylvania,
95 percent were drilled in the developed world of North America and Europe, and
almost 75 percent of the total in the United States--not including Alaska.<p>

Only five percent of the total were drilled in Latin America, Asia, or Africa
--which is to say that India and China will indeed be putting great demands on
the world oil supply as they emerge as developing nations. But their people are
sitting on vast oceans of oil and gas that have not been discovered, because
there has been no exploration in these countries.<p>

Why has there been so much exploration and discovery here? The most important
reason is that Americans are the only people on earth who automatically have
mineral rights to the surface property they own. Once the countries of the rest
of the world begin giving their own citizens these rights, instead of hoarding
them for the state, exploration will expand dramatically, and so will
discovery.<p>

	<i>Joseph Romm and Charles Curtis reply:</i><p>

We agree with Michael Baly that natural gas is going to play a key role in
meeting our growing demand for energy. Natural gas is the premier hydrocarbon
in our country's fossil-fuel-based energy portfolio, not only because of the
efficiency and the economic and environmental benefits of natural gas, but also
as part of our effort to reduce our rising national dependence on imported oil.
To use Daniel Yergin's phrase, it has become the recognized "prince of
hydrocarbons."<p>

The Department of Energy has been out front in supporting the increased use of
natural gas in electricity generation, in industrial co-generation and process
systems, in residential and commercial heating and cooling technologies, and in
natural-gas-vehicle markets. As noted in the article, small gas-fired turbines
and fuel cells using natural gas will be essential for the growth of a more
broadly distributed and cleaner global electricity system, which is one reason
that the department supports their development.<p>

Renewable energy will also play an increasingly important role in the next
century. The nation is, however, only slowly recovering from the 90 percent cut
in federal funding for renewable energy that occurred in the 1980s. Charles
Boardman seems to have missed a key point of our article. We can make and have
made a competitive wind-power machine. Rising electricity prices are not
required to achieve significant use of renewable energy in the marketplace.
Rather, we believe that with continued R&amp;D we will see growth in all forms
of renewables even if the price of electricity from traditional sources
declines.<p>

Kenneth Harrison and Lynn Stiles are correct that geothermal energy also holds
great promise. The geothermal heat pump they describe can both improve the
nation's environment and lower our energy bills. It provides exactly the kind
of social and economic benefits that make it perfect for the type of
public-private partnership the department has been pursuing.<p>

The bottom line is that the demand for energy is going to grow rapidly in the
coming decades. A number of fuels and technologies will be used to meet that
demand, because different sectors of the economy have different energy needs
and different parts of the world have different energy resources. The nation
that is the world leader in the development and use of the cleanest and most
efficient energy supply and end-use technologies will create more jobs, have
more competitive industries, and enjoy the highest environmental quality of
life of any nation in the world. Maintaining that leadership is a key role of
the Department of Energy.

	<font size=5>N</font>icholas Lemann's discussion of Robert Putnam's "Bowling Alone" ("Kicking in
Groups," April <i>Atlantic</i>) may have created a new parlor game for those of
us who, like Lemann, are skeptical of Putnam's theory. The game is to identify
counterexamples of the Putnam scenario.<p>

Three that occurred to me almost immediately were the Adopt-a-Highway program,
the banding together of senior citizens for an immense array of activities, and
groups espousing environmental causes.<p>

The Adopt-a-Highway program blankets a large part of the United States today.
Within it groups assume responsibility for removing litter from specified
stretches of roadway, usually two miles each. The roadside signs I have seen
identify service clubs, fraternities, sororities, businesses, and families as
pickup volunteers. The program began in Texas less than twenty years ago and
has spread to every state in the union, without the benefit of a national
association or federal intervention. In Oregon alone more than a thousand
groups pick up litter along 3,000 miles of highway. It is difficult to imagine
a more direct civic activity.<p>

In the increasingly large numbers of retirement communities (all of the Sun
Cities and their clones, for example) residents form groups for all manner of
games, crafts, hobbies, and intellectual interests. On a recent visit to Sun
City Palm Desert, in California, I noted nearly forty clubs that had been
formed by the local population of less than 2,000 people. Whatever it is that
these people are interested in doing, they most certainly appear not to desire
to do it alone.<p>

Environmental groups, from the long-established Sierra Club to splinter groups
of environmental radicals, have grown apace in recent years. The success of The
Nature Conservancy in particular is illustrative, depending as it does not only
on fundraising and the efforts of paid staff but also on the direct involvement
of many volunteers.<p>

Times change. What was important yesterday loses meaning today. The Grange
halls and American Legion posts may be nearly empty, but computer-user-group
meetings overflow. Americans still group together, but they are also pragmatic
to the core, and no longer have the time to spend on ritual and outmoded
causes. Instead of drinking at the Elks Club bar, they attend investment-club
meetings, and have increasingly deserted the bowling alley in favor of the
men's (or women's) association at their local golf course.<p>

I firmly believe, based on Putnam's measure, that America's civic virtue is
still intact.<p>

<font size=5>R.</font> W. Apple Jr. may be a hell of a travel writer, but on the history of the
Weimar Republic he is something less than well-informed ("The Old Made New,"
April <i>Atlantic</i>). Common mistake that it may be, it is not true that the
Weimar Republic, as he states, "flourished briefly between the wars and then
succumbed to hyperinflation." The infamous Weimar hyperinflation occurred in
1923. After the implementation of the Dawes Plan, in 1924, the German economy
did flourish until 1929-1930, when the American-bred Great Depression took hold
of Germany's economy. From then until Hitler usurped power, in 1933-1934 (the
actual demise of the Weimar Republic), Germany's economic crisis was a
depression, or deflation, of the currency along with high unemployment--the
condition opposite to inflation!<p>

Probably disillusionment with the German economy lingered from the inflationary
crisis into the depression, but the direct economic cause of the Weimar's fall
was the latter.<p>

	<font size=5>T</font>he federal census for 1990 confirms something that some of us had suspected:
families with school-aged children make up a surprisingly small percentage of
the U.S. population.<p>

<p>

In 1950, five years after the end of the Second World War, 46.3 percent of
American households had children under eighteen. Ten years later the historic
Baby Boom was at full crest, and families with children were a remarkable 48.4
percent of all American households, just short of a majority.<p>

<p>

But then by 1970 the proportion of households with children was down to 44
percent, and in 1980 it was down to 37.5 percent. In 1990, after a full decade
in which Baby Boomers had had babies themselves, and were joined in the
endeavor by record numbers of new immigrants of childbearing age, the
proportion was down again, to 34.6 percent. Elementary school enrollments have
begun picking up during the past few years, but in most parts of the country
they will not achieve the peak numbers of the past.<p>

<p>

It's in the old industrial states of the Northeast and the Midwest that the new
demographics are most apparent. In New York, households with children were 44.5
percent of the total in 1960, 41.2 percent in 1970, 35.2 percent in 1980, and
31.1 percent in 1990. The figures for Massachusetts were 46.4 percent, 42.4
percent, 35.1 percent, and 32.3 percent; for Illinois 46.3 percent, 43.4
percent, 37.4 percent, and 33.4 percent; and for Michigan 51.4 percent,47.6
percent, 37.7 percent, and 34.9 percent.<p>

<p>

Surprisingly, the Sun Belt states do not rack up the countervailing numbers
that the popular impression might suggest. These places are seeing the
migration of young people from other parts of the country and immigration from
Asia and Latin America--but they also attract senior citizens. The net result:
large overall declines in the proportion of young families from 1960 to 1970
and from 1970 to 1980, with only minor rebounds from 1980 to 1990.<p>

<p>

Numbers like these are not rigidly predictive, but they provide a way of
thinking about the downward-tending fortunes of public education in many
communities. Heads of households with children under eighteen are, after all,
the core constituency for education in this country--not because they are more
enlightened or civic-minded than anybody else but precisely because they are
like everybody else: they think first about their own welfare and that of their
immediate families. When they vote or meet with or talk to their neighbors,
they are likely to have the schools in mind. And when their numbers begin to
decline substantially, the schools will likely suffer.<p>

<p>

The baby dearth has hit the schools of the American suburb hard. The very
community that was such a good place to raise a family in the 1960s is the most
likely to have a large complement of empty-nesters in the 1990s, many of whom
will be less interested in the schools than they once were.<p>

<p>

The district I represent in the Massachusetts state senate includes Belmont, a
middle-class and upper-middle-class suburb of 24,720. Belmont is a wonderful
town, home to many people, once blue-collar, who have moved out over the years
from the urban environs of Cambridge and Boston, and to others who hail from
around the country and have been drawn to professional opportunities in the
nearby cities or along the Route 128 technology belt.<p>

<p>

Belmont takes great pride in both the reputation and the appearance of its
gracefully landscaped high school, complete with duck pond, which lies near the
town center. More than 90 percent of the school's juniors and seniors take the
SATs, the average combined verbal and mathematics score is over a thousand, and
87 percent of the graduating class at least begin a four-year college
education.<p>

<p>

But the Belmont schools are caught in the demographic squeeze. In 1960, the
postwar influx having supplied a stream of young settlers, 42.0 percent of the
households had children under eighteen. Ten years later the figure had declined
to 35.7 percent. It was down to 28.7 percent by 1980 and 26.4 percent by 1990.
Outside observers would hardly call Belmont a retirement community, yet
sometime around 1975 it reached a watershed for an American town: the
proportion of its households containing people over sixty-five exceeded the
proportion of its households with children under eighteen.<p>

<p>

The effects of such a demographic squeeze are manifested subtly, and only over
time. In the twelve years that have passed since Proposition 2 1/2, the
Massachusetts property-tax limitation law, took effect, Belmont town meeting
has never placed a proposal on the ballot to exempt the operating budget of the
schools from the tax cap. Such a proposal, termed an override, would require
the approval of the townspeople in an open election, and the risk of rejection
has always seemed too high.<p>

<p>

As fiscal year 1991 approached, and Belmont town finances began to be very
tight, it was deemed the wiser course to mount an override campaign on the more
unifying issue of funding trash collection, in the knowledge that an exemption
for trash would have the effect of freeing up money for the schools. Even this
question passed by a scant 439 votes out of 5,585 votes cast, after an arduous
effort by proponents of town services. "We'll never do it again," a member of
the League of Women Voters told me with a groan.<p>

<p>

Belmont is a healthy, thriving place, and it may well be that the citizenry
will rally behind its tradition of fine education. But the going will be tough,
because the problem remains: in cities and towns across the country a
demographic bulge once operated to keep the schools at the center of community
life, and now it is gone. Today the presence of kids in every other house on
the street is something out of the past, and the parents of schoolchildren,
middle-class and poor alike, are the country's newest minority group. At a
historic moment when the schools need to be better than ever, they are instead
treading water, even slipping back a bit, and by world standards genuine
excellence is a long way off.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

One has to wonder, then: Will communities like Belmont, composed of growing
proportions of nonparents and empty nesters--people more likely to insist on
quality health care than on quality education--continue to support their
schools? To put the matter simply, will the votes be there? And if they are
not, what does American democracy do then?<p>

<p>

There is an answer, one as old as the republic. In 1787, as the people of the
liberated colonies wrestled with the question of a Constitution for their new
country James Madison wrote "The Advantages of Union," the famous Federalist
Paper in which he proposed to control the effects of faction and the resulting
risk to individuals of mistreatment by local majorities. His recourse was the
intelligent design of government. Madison wrote,<p>

<p>

"The smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller
the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and
execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater
variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of
the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other
citizens...."<p>

<p>

Applying Madison's idea to education by extending state and national
responsibility for the protection of parental minorities might be expected to
stir up a fuss. There is, after all, a long-standing tradition of local control
over the schools. But no one means to abolish the local function; balance is
the issue here--an artful recalibration of roles among the local, state, and
national spheres of American democracy. The vexing question of school finance
cries out for Madisonian thinking. As a modest step toward escaping the tyranny
of local majorities, federal funding for public education should be returned
over time to the level at which it was in 1980--9.8 percent of school
expenditures. This would amount to about $23 billion a year: a good start to
reinvigorating the federal role, especially if the commitment spurred matching
efforts on the part of the states.<p>

<p>

As sensibly Madisonian as it may be, increasing federal spending on education
is not the only option. Why not a federalism swap? If Washington were to divide
its savings from defense cuts and other sources into essentially three
accounts, deficit reduction, economic stimulus, and health care, and adopt a
funding schedule for the third which picked up the state and local portions of
Medicaid as part of a national health insurance scheme, the other tiers of
government would have more than enough money to fund education
reform--including special aid to poor districts--on their own. This would
neatly apportion responsibility: health-care finance at the federal level,
school finance at the state and local levels.<p>

<p>

The deepening political isolation of families with children imperils the aims
of excellence and equity both. A Madisonian solution, its roots deep in the
soil of traditional American thinking, offers us a way out. The Clinton
Administration and Congress should take it.

Garden literature, descriptive, reminiscent, and technical, has blossomed soprofusely among us during the last decade, that he should be an expert indeedwho ventures to add thereto. Gardening is distinctly the fashion, and Americangardens have already begun to form a school of their own. But literature ingeneral is there to prove that, on a worthy subject, or one merely interestingto successive generations, too much, apparently, can never be said. Onlyephemeral matters are over-written. And as a friend of gardens goes about theland he observes that, while they are a good deal the fashion, they are notnearly enough the fashion. They seem chiefly to be the fashion, that is, amongpossessors of many acres, or those who keep up at least two permanent homes.There are still many dwellers in great houses, however, who would ransack fivecontinents to match a curtain and a carpet, but whose grounds show scarcely atrace of human intelligence; while to too many inhabitants of suburbs andvillages a garden means no more than a cabbage-patch. Until such as these,therefore, are turned from the error of their way, until America ceases to bethe most gardenless country in the world, too much cannot be said aboutgardens.<p><p>Let no one conclude that I am about to break into a panegyric of the spade andthe watering-pot, of weeding and early rising, and I know not what othersalutary exercises. These have been sufficiently celebrated. There is no needfor me to mention them, save by way of insinuating how fractional a part of agarden they are. As for vegetables, I do not consider a plot of ground devotedto them worthy of the honorable name of garden. Vegetables are, of course, apart of gardening, but the least, the last,--for those who do not have to raisethem, the most dishonorable part.<p><p>Even the culture of flowers is not the whole of a garden. It is a larger partthan the preceding because it gives play to the rarer, the more trampledinstincts of man,--his sense of color, his feeling for beauty, his reaching outafter something beyond the mere necessity of the instant,--but the cultivationof flowers is only a rudimentary stage of a greater art; and happy are they whopass beyond it into the higher degrees of initiation.<p><p>Having said so much I may, perhaps, be expected, particularly by the outragedallies of the onion and the bean, to state in so many words what I conceive agarden to be. Not at all. I propose to make no such mistake. Has any one yetdefined religion, or virtue, or love, or life? Only by experience may these,and gardens, be known, and by study of the great examples. Garden masterpiecesare to be found in almost every part of the world where travelers go. TheArabs, the Persians, and the Japanese, among remoter peoples, have in theirseveral ways carried the art to great perfection. Those of our own stock whohave best understood a garden seem to have been the Italians of theRenaissance, after whom the French and the English worked with the happiestresults. It is not for me to commemorate the magic and the melancholy of thosegreat villas that hold half of the wonder of Italy. Yet it is something to mypurpose to recall one or two nameless gardens, perhaps even more characteristicof a country where no piece of ground is considered too small or too dark forits decorative treatment.<p><p>One of the earliest with which I formed personal ties was in Asolo, whither Ifirst went in a youthful enthusiasm for Browning, but which I found so muchmore poetic than the poet that my enthusiasm cooled to a disconcerting degree.What to me were bells and pomegranates of the printed page, when growingpomegranates and distantly-sounding bells might be enjoyed so much more vividlyin a certain narrow riva--as the local dialect has it--overhanging the vastplain of the Po?<p><p>On one side of this little garden a grassy walk followed the edge of adeclivity where grapes sunned themselves, to a clump of laurel trees. There asmall white god stood against the sacred green, and there it was good to take abook in the morning--or tea in the afternoon. Across a dip of the town youcould see the Queen Cornaro's tower printed against the sky, and the pillars ofa colonnade, and the sharpness of a cypress tree; and beyond it all the longscroll of the Dolomites sank into the plain. On the other side, a charmille ofclipped beech made a cool green tunnel under the wall. That was for sun or forrain, and it led to an arbor of roses. Here, too, the ground dropped away,falling from garden to garden, from vineyard to vineyard, from chestnut glen tochestnut glen, until the great green plain spread out its wonderful web thatfaded into a blue haze like the sea. Out of the plain rose, like the AmberIsles that Strabo called them, the strange cones of the Euganean Hills. Beyondthem, to the left, you sometimes caught under a clear sun, or a high moon, theglint of the Adriatic.<p><p>For certain gardens, swimming bodily in that sea, I came to have a fantasticweakness. By nothing am I more easily undone than by the association of growingthings with water. Then the crowded islands of Venice have so little room tospare that the flowers and vines and trees prospering there in so manyinhospitable crannies prove again how deep-rooted in the Italian nature is theneed of beauty, and the instinct to create it. There are, to be sure, reallybig gardens in the place, some hidden away where no outsider would guess. Notthe least delightful, though, are the numberless closes, each with its owningenuities for privacy or pleasure, so small that I used to wonder how springever found them out. Most of them, of course, I never visited except inimagination, although to not a few I vulgarly obtained entrance under a falsepretense of house-hunting. But the one with a long red wall above a canal in anout-of-the-way part of town, through the grill work of whose open arches pouredsuch a sense of green seclusion--who would have violated it?  And while I wouldhave sold my soul to possess the giardinetto with a Gothic water-gate and abalcony jutting out from the top of the wall, where seats were set in theshadow of a huge acacia, it was better, since that might not be, never topenetrate it.<p><p>I cannot forbear mentioning, however, one into which I penetrated so often thatmy affections took root beyond any possibility of transplanting. I have neverforgiven D'Annunzio and Mrs. Temple Thurston for afterwards putting it intobooks without so much as changing its name. If they had known it as well as I,they could not have made out of it such copy as they did. It belonged to apalazzo of the Renaissance, in whose great lower hall the shimmer of the canalin front met the green light of the garden behind. You entered it by a formalcourt, where battered Roman emperors stood gravely in niches of the wall oneither side, and a low parapet surmounted by a grille of wrought iron sharpenedyour anticipation of joys to come. This grille was also a device to set off thegarden gate, a charming old twisted cancello between high stone posts, whereonnymphs struggled in the arms of satyrs, or Sabines were rapt to Rome.<p><p>And then you were upon enchanted ground. You would never have suspectedyourself to be in the heart of a city. Scarcely even would you have suspectedyourself to be in Venice, for the water was nowhere visible--although the senseof it would sometimes fill the silence at a gondolier's cry or the distantsplash of an oar. A long path led you, if flower-beds and fruit trees and shadytrellises did not beguile you by the way, to a sort of temple set against anivied wall. Therein were celebrated no rites more mysterious than those whichcaused this paradise to bloom from the winter day when the Japanese calycanthusheld out a first spicy hope of spring till the last chrysanthemum of autumnbowed its head. Yet could rites more mysterious have been celebrated?<p><p>Certain miracles that I beheld there have haunted my memory ever since: a grayApril morning of sirocco, when the almond blossoms, the flaming tulips, theyoung green of the vines, hung as if painted on the motionless air; a summernight when the roses had an unearthly pallor under a half-eaten moon, whoseghostliness was somehow one with their perfume and with the phosphorescence ofdew tipping their petals; a day when the trees stood part submerged in fog,into which leaves dropped slowly, slowly, one after another, and sank out ofsight. And there were times when one yielded quite shamelessly to thesentimental. They were more likely to be times of crickets, I think, than ofbirds--when it was impossible not to feel, like another essence of thesunlight, the bittersweet of life that lingers about old houses, and placeswhere men have died, and things that forgotten hands have touched.<p><p>This garden has always remained for me the perfection and pattern of its kind.It was not very big. It had none of the tricks, unless you count the court andthe temple, whereby the old gardeners sometimes sought to catch your fancy. Itdid not even afford the view which contributes so much to the famous places ofItaly. It was merely a small level inclosure behind a house, a larger and moredelightful living-room, where its owners could find quiet and beauty, and theirown portion of the earth. And while the grace of its setting, and some breathof legend that blew about it, were not a little of its charm, the essentialelements of that charm were so simple that I am never through marveling at myfellow countrymen for so often wasting their own opportunities. Is it that theyfail to perceive their opportunities? Or do they live in fear of Mrs. Grundyand the nemesis she has sometimes visited upon a neighbor who dared to call hisground his own? Or are they so sunken in the fallacies of that school ofgardening, so-called of landscape, that they find no beauty save in themonotonous wastes whereby they surround themselves?<p><p>I recognize, of course, that its lawns give a cachet to an American village;and a cachet is never to be scorned. Moreover I would be the last to deny thatan American country street makes a most agreeable perspective in summer, withits arching trees and its park-like fringe of green and its clear-coloredhouses set a little apart from each other and from the public way. And there isnot a little to be said for the confidence and friendliness which carry lifeforward so sociably in the open. Yet I never admire one of these thoroughfareswithout amazement at the householders who can freely throw away half their landand all their privacy in order to make a boulevard of an indifferent highway. Imyself should be totally incapable of such a renunciation. The first thing Ishould do, were I so happy as to own the most infinitesimal fraction of theearth's surface, would be to surround at least a portion of it--possiblysacrificing the 'front lawn' on the altar of public opinion and democracy--witha hedge so thick and so high that my neighbors would have to go to some troublein order to take observations of my affairs. And the next thing I should dowould be to lay out that inclosed space after a design of my own imagining.<p><p>Whistler liked to maintain that Nature is but a clumsy artist, incapable ofproperly harmonizing or arranging her materials. I do not know how far I shouldbe willing to follow Whistler. I have seen works of Nature that I should havebeen very sorry to let any one touch. But such masterpieces, save minutedetails of them, or the great picture of the skies, cannot exist in towns ortheir vicinity. And it is impossible for a strip of grass between aneatly-painted house and an oiled road to produce an illusion of thewild-wood--unless it is so big or so cleverly inclosed by trees as to beoutside the scope of this paper. The open lawn of custom, with its geometricalboundaries and its weekly or bi-weekly shaving, is as frankly artificial as themost elaborate perversities of the Baroque period. A really good lawn,moreover, even, green, and free of weeds, exacts a greater tribute of time andmoney than a garden of the same size.<p><p>Convention for convention, therefore, the more considered lines of a gardenharmonize better with houses and streets than any attempt to domesticate theprairie on a hundred-foot front. And the design of a garden satisfies aninstinct as native to us as any other. There is something in us that lovessymmetry, selection, arrangement, as well as wildness and irregularity. A smallgarden, accordingly, gives its owner a far greater opportunity to expresshimself than a small lawn. The usual lawn expresses nothing so much a vacancyof mind or an impious waste of good material; whereas in a garden any man maybe an artist, may experiment with all the subtleties or simplicities of line,mass, color, and composition, and taste the god-like joys of the creator.<p><p>I hesitate to use the epithet 'formal' with regard to a small garden, for Igenerally find the word to suggest trees clipped into the form of peacocks, orflower-beds imitating carpets and sofa-cushions. How little, indeed, theItalian secret is understood, even by persons who have had opportunity to studyit at first hand, we sometimes see graphically illustrated in this country bythose who tuck a pergola and a few bits of marble into one corner of theirgrounds, and then call upon their friends to admire their Italian garden. Oneis reminded of the mansions that used to abound more self-confidently than theydo now, wherein one was led from an Empire salon to a Japanese room, andfinally brought to rest in a Turkish corner.<p><p>As to pergolas, by the way, I often ask myself where in the world the strangeerections that stalk through an increasing number of American gardens, thateven cover not a few American verandahs, staring-white, bare of foliage, andsolid enough to support a sky-scraper, are supposed to have derived theirorigin. In some of the greatest Italian gardens the pergolas are made ofslender unplaned poles fastened together by withes, which are invisible underthe vines that cover them. The nakedness of the American pergolas has sometimesbeen explained to me by the fact that grape-vines must be cut down every yearin order to bear well. What of it? The vine exists for the pergola, not thepergola for the vine. Even in countries so poor as Greece and Turkey thousandsof vines are grown simply for their shade and beauty. If we called a pergola atrellis, and were done with it, we might be less in danger of disfiguring ourgardens by a species of snow-shed.<p><p>Pergolas, however, or marbles either, do not constitute an Italian garden. Thatis a matter of structure, whose principle will naturally work out differentresults under different conditions. It has already worked out very happyresults in this country--results often bearing no superficial resemblance tothe popular idea of an Italian garden. For the principle is not Italian or ofany other nationality; it is merely a principle of good taste, which any womanwho knows how to dress should, with a little imagination, be able to grasp veryquickly. It consists in treating a piece of ground as if it were at one withthe architecture upon it. Thus the marbles, in Italy, and the occasional whitepergolas, repeat a note of the villa, which always has a good deal of marbleabout it; but they would be absurdly out of place if the villa happened to be acolored timber house.<p><p>The reason why the grounds are formal is that the villa itself is more formalthan most of our country-houses. The degree of elaborateness depends upon thescale of the place, though some formality is the only possible transitionbetween house and country. At the same time the grounds are laid out withreference to whatever view they may command. And they are planned to contain aconstructional beauty of their own, independent of decoration or view. Thus agarden of agreeable design, which is accentuated by evergreens and simplearchitectural features, gives pleasure in winter as in summer, whether it iskept up or not. Its pattern attracts the eye like a picture. Whereas a blanklawn, unmarked by paths or anything else save trees or shrubs set about atrandom, is rarely a pleasant sight during the leafless part of the year.<p><p>The best thing, after all, about an Italian garden is that it is intended to belived in. The paths, the arbors, the terraces, the seats, the pergolas, andother covered walks, are not mere ingenuities of ornament. They are for use.They make it possible to extend the life of the house under the sky, and invarious weathers. The wall, accordingly, is a necessary part of the scheme; forthe garden without an inclosure is a picture without a frame, a room without apartition.<p><p>Here is where I find the lawns of my country most intolerable. That they shouldbe without form and void is less injurious than that they should bear norelation to the lives of their possessors. How pitiable are thousands ofunfortunate persons, of unquestioned title to varying portions of the earth'ssurface, who yet go down to the grave ignorant of their true heritage. For thesums which they expend in maintaining vacancy about them they might create eachhis own Eden. But no; custom forbids them walls, even behind the building line.Their very grass is not their own, for it must be kept wet, and many feet willwear it out. Moreover, its exposure to every eye hedges them more narrowlyabout than privet or masonry. Would they taste that pleasant idleness of theclement season which is to loll with a book under a tree--or without one? Theymust dress for it, if they have the tree, and take thought not to assume tooundignified a posture. Is it theirs to spread the family board in the open?They might as well spread it on the sidewalk. They may not even indulge in sopromiscuous an entertainment as a lawn-party without darkenings of the horizonby the uninvited.<p><p>And as for the more intimate passages of life!--What can there be of intimacyabout a lawn? It is part of the street, at best no more than a part of aneighbor's premises; and the householder must comport himself accordingly. Heshall never really know--I do not speak, of course, of those who are happyenough to live in open country or surrounded by their own acres--what lifeout-of-doors may be. His only ideas of such a thing is to spend an hour at thecountry club, or a holiday in the mountains or by the sea. The notion that hisown ground might be put to any use has never entered his head--unless in therudimentary form represented by a potato patch. But until he and his houseenjoy the freedom of a garden, they will never be more than strangers to thesun.<p><p>There prevails among many of us an actual hostility toward gardens, upon whichI have mused not a little. One would suppose that a people so devoted to thecult of fresh air, so given to piazzas and 'sleeping porches,' would be quickto afford themselves so simple a luxury. I cannot believe the objectionoftenest made to me: that mosquitoes prevent the enjoyment of a garden. True asit is in part, it is true only for certain seasons and for certain hours of theday. Mosquitoes never yet kept any one who really wanted a garden from havingone. Neither do I put much faith in the altruism of those who protest againstwalls because they prevent outsiders from enjoying one's own grounds. It wouldbe entirely possible to make a defense of walls on the highest psychologicalbasis. Nay, what could be more delightful than to take an outraged community bythe hand and point out that a glimpse of green through an open gate, a vinehanging over a coping, a tree peering above a hedge, suggests more to theinquiring mind than the most unobstructed view? But I suspect that the realmilk in that cocoanut is a fear lest the rocker on the piazza be cut off fromthe spectacle of the street and of neighboring rockers.<p><p>Far be it from me to denounce the pleasures of the rocking-chair, or ofcontemplating the human spectacle. They merely afford me a step in aphilosophical inquiry, leading to the conviction that, as a people, we aredistinctly rebellious against the theory of a garden. It is natural enough thatthis should be. The sons of pioneers with all the blood of adventure in theirveins, we are not even yet settled into this huge, half-tamed country of ours.We have a genuine love of wildness and space, which is impatient of what theremay be dainty and confined about a garden. And we are somewhat notoriouslyaverse to anything that resembles idleness. But I think there also must be inus a nerve duller than in other men; a blind spot in our eyes.<p><p>At any rate, as I go about those parts of our land where our fathers had earlyopportunity of expressing themselves, those parts which remain least troubledby foreign ideas, I never fail to be impressed by the unerring instinct withwhich the houses turn their backs to the most desirable view. Being given theirchoice of a happy valley or a dusty road, they invariably prefer the latter.Set down on a spot where it is impossible to avoid some agreeable outlook, theyblock out as much of it as possible by an enormous barn.<p><p>Now a Turk is regarded by the inhabitants of those houses as a bloody andheathenish man, unsusceptible to any of the softer feelings that visit theirown breasts. Yet that heathenish and bloody man has an unerring instinct ofanother kind. He has, uninstructed by any Village Improvement Society, anatural genius for placing his house, and, cut off in a town from wideprospects, the view of trees, the sight and sound of water, it would beinconceivable to him to make his back-yard such an abomination of desolation asmay be seen from the rear windows of any American city.<p><p>The sense of beauty is a sprite of strange whims, visiting those who know hernot, abandoning those who passionately sue her, never dwelling long in one timeor people, and always discovering herself in new forms. If she has yet done nomore than visit our shores furtively, and at rare intervals, that is no reasonfor giving up hope that she may some day reign in our midst. Shall there neverbe a Renaissance or Golden Age again?<p><p>In this small question of gardens, however, there is another element, anothernational idiosyncrasy, related to the rocking-chairs noted above. A largerexpression of it is the house on whose piazza the rocking-chair rocks; a housewhose front door is courteously made of glass in order to deprive the public ofas little as possible of what goes forward within, and whose interiorpartitions have almost totally disappeared. All is the integration of Spencer;there is scarcely any differentiation here between one room and another. In sofar as consciousness may be concerned in these things I have no doubt that theyare ordered for the common good, and on some vague protestant principle of alife to come--as of large entertainments that seldom take place. Yet I seem toconnect them with our somewhat noted American partiality for hotels--forchange, travel, and publicity also, as opposed to rootedness and the individuallife.<p><p>Here I think must lie the seed of that unfriendliness toward gardens which Inot seldom encounter. It is the more curious that any such unfriendlinessshould exist, since individualism is supposed to hold freer sway among us thanamong any other people of the earth. Yet, with all that individualism andvitality, there is lacking a certain sense of life, a sense of the life of themoment, which our bloody and heathenish friend the Turk possesses along withhis sense of beauty. Is it that, like the younger sons we are of all theyounger sons of the world, we must still forage and sow wild oats, theresources of the inner life being a secret of age?<p><p>Separation, after all, is as native and as needful to us as society. Every manbears within him a solitary world which no one else may enter. Nor is thismerely a matter of the sentimental. There is something aloof within us thatwill not be divided or communicated. Our rarest, like our bitterest, momentsare for ourselves alone. And only by being most himself can a man be most forhis kind. It is entirely possible to pay too much for the common good.Dangerous doctrine though this be, double-edged for good or ill, it is provenby great poets; by the great initiators of any breed. Whence it is that agarden wall is no piece of that exclusiveness at which we like to throw ourword 'un-American.' If private life be less American than life of the street,the sooner we naturalize it the better.<p>				<!--DROPCAP-->													<!--INSERT TEXT UP TO													HERE--></blockquote>												<!-- end article --><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br>			<!--NAVIGATION BUTTONS--><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

I was doing in it junior high and high school.<p><p><b>So you always knew that you wanted to be a film critic?</b><p><p>Not really. I always did movie reviews, book reviews, and things like that. Ialways reviewed. I don't know what that means, but I thought I would getinvolved in the making of movies. I left my junior year of high school atCherry Hill High School in West Cherry Hill, New Jersey, to go to NYU filmschool for a year because they didn't require a high school diploma at thattime. I just took the SAT.<p><p><b>How old were you?</b><p><p>I was 17 when I entered NYU. I don't know what it's like now but then it wasimpossible to be an undergraduate major in film. You basically took regularliberal arts courses until you were an upper classman. I thought theundergraduate film courses were kind of stupid. The film history courses I'dalready had. You took a core course called Perception where you had to dothings like take a blindfolded trip down St. Mark's place and invent somethingbased on your experience. I thought that was pretty awful. My classmatesincluded Paul Barnes who is now Ken Burns' film editor, he dropped out of NYUfilm school too. And Franz Litz, the guy who wrote the book <i>Unstrung Heroes</I> wasbased on, he transferred out too. I transferred to Harvard. I figured if I'mgoing to read books then let's really read books. I majored in history andliterature.<p><p><b>Did you go back to high school at all?</b><p><p>No. I got my high school equivalency after about a year at NYU. <p><p><b>You got into Harvard without a high school diploma?</b><p><p>Well, Harvard just looked at my NYU stuff and my SATs. I majored in history andliterature there and wrote reviews for <i>The Crimson.</i> While at NYU I submitted apiece to <i>Film Studies Review</i> on <i>The Wild Bunch</i> and they took it. That was thestart of my serious career. That was <i>Film Society Review,</i> a publication put outby the American Federation of Film Societies. I think that both thoseorganizations are defunct now. It was very socially conscious to the point ofcrippling after a while. Although it was ideological, the intent of thepublication was to focus on a historical and social content which I didn'tthink was bad but had its own sort of distorting effect after a while. I keptwriting for them through college and the year after. After college <i>The Atlantic</i>was one of the places I started free-lancing pieces to. It only took me about15 years to break in.<p><p><b>The Atlantic doesn't run a lot of movie columns. The ones that we run, whatdo you feel is special about them?</b><p><p>The challenge of selling a movie piece to <i>The Atlantic</i> is to try to dosomething that talks about a set of movies at hand and not to go on endlesslyabout theory or trends. Deal with the actual works. Readers like to havecriticism that is connected to the object being criticized. The challenge forsomeone like me is to come up with a particular thing that will open updifferent issues that are important for general consideration. In each of thepieces I've done I've tried to do that. <p><p>It is hard to explain why some things have a deeper resonance than otherthings. And what those are and if they're just in the film world or outside thefilm world. You just try to explore as many of the aspects as possible. Thechallenge with movies coming out so fast is to do something that is mildlytopical and is not being done everywhere else. The first piece I wrote for<i>The Atlantic</i> was on the progression of pop culture superheores fromJames Bond to Rambo in 1985. The hook was this new film in a series which wassupposed to be the new Bond series, which was called <i>Remo Williams,</i> based onabout a fifty book series. Then I did a series of three pieces for <i>TheAtlantic. </i>One was on the restoration of the <i>Bridge Over the River Kwai,</i>which turned into sort of a piece on the difference in the level between whatwas regarded as a blockbuster back in 1950s back when it came out and what is ablockbuster today. Here was a movie that has a very complicated attitude towardthe military and was a huge box office success, so I compared it to <i>TheFugitive</i> that year. The second piece I did was on <i>The Wild Bunch</i> about theratings fight and about movie violence. About the difference between violencethat meant something and didn't mean something in movies. As well as beingabout the particular great movie. A lot of reporting went into why the ratingfights developed and how the rating board operated.<p><p><b>Why did you chose Walter Hill for this piece?</b><p><p>This piece started because I got to see this movie early and I thought it wasWalter Hill's best movie. I could tell already that studio people, though theyknew how good the movie was, were nervous would find any audience out there. Ialso felt watching it that we were at a point to talk about defending the rightof filmmakers to make depictions men of violence and not just violence itself,the whole ambiance of it. We have reached a certain point of decadence in whichit becomes so jokey, so hip and cool to play with violent elements in movieslike the Tarantino films and the Hong Kong films. Here was an attempt, eventhough the violence was done a way that was extremely terse and the opposite ofwhat Hill had done before, to treat those materials seriously and to do otherthings with the type of action movie form that were very complicated. It getsinto the state of mind of a hero who doesn't like to explain himself; throughflashbacks and a fractured narrative the movie maker could explain him withoutviolating his integrity. This was really something worth pointing out topeople. That this kind of character who we're used to apologizing for in termsof revisionist movies and stuff--the western gun fighter who does kill a passelof men sometimes with motives that are somewhat shaky--but seen in his time hecan be justified and stand for certain positive things. So you can take aclear-eyed view and come out with a balanced ledger sheet--another thing donewell in the movie. <p><p><b>Will this movie get a big blockbuster advertising budget?</b><p><p>It's likely not to get that big kind of push. There's no merchandising thingyou can do with it. It is definitely an adult movie. It's about the end of aman's life. There is a twenty-minute stretch at the beginning that is reallyrip-snorting frontier stuff, but if you sell that, people will feel cheatedabout the rest of the movie. <p><p>In general there has been sort of a main-streaming just in term of the moviepress. You have niche audiences and the blockbuster audiences. If you're aniche movie you get a grand prize at Sundance, you get a certain acclaim and acertain push legitimate for that kind of movie. If you're a big mainstream typeof movie and you're starring Tom Hanks then you're given a slice of Americanaor some suitable romantic comedy then you get the other surefire push. Ifyou're in the category of the action movie or the Western--which is even moresuspect now--and you try to do something different with it and it has elementsthat are subtle, ironic, or more downbeat than people expect then it doesn'tnecessarily play to the big numbers. Then not only do you not get the big pushfrom the studio you don't get the push from the rest of the press out therethat you really need.<p><p>Films that are more challenging like this one, if there's a sense that it couldbe a commercial failure, then critics don't want to be attached to it. Ifthere's a box office risk. Critics are like studios today: They don't want tobe associated with a box office risk. <p><br><i>Interview by Marty Hergert</i><p>	</blockquote><hr><pre></pre><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a><a href="../contents.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-toc.gif" width=72 height=23 border=0 alt="Contents"></a><a href="http://vws.agtnet.com/atl_find.html"><img src="../../../images/bt-find.gif" width=61 height=23 border=0 alt="Search"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; (1995) by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

DICKEY, President	of Dartmouth since 1945. "Remember that he is different, faced with graver	issues than we were a generation ago, more responsible in his decisions, and	much more lonely." President Dickey graduated from Dartmouth with the class of	1929 and from the Harvard Law School three years later. He practiced law in	Boston, served in the State Department over an eleven-year period, and taught	foreign affairs before returning to his alma mater. His findings in this	article will be stimulating and reassuring to many parents.</i></font><p>	<p>			<p>		<font size=5>T</font><font size=3>he American male at the peak of his physical powers and appetites, driving a	hundred and sixty big white horses across the scenes of an increasingly open	society, with weekend money in his pocket and with little prior exposure to	trouble and tragedy, personifies an "accident going out to happen." He is not	always a college undergraduate, and not all undergraduates are trouble-prone,	but I am sure that any close observer of the campus will agree that there is no	more vulnerable human combination than an undergraduate.<p>		<p>		<p>		The college undergraduate is a lot of things--many of them as familiar,	predictable, and responsive as the bounce of a basketball, and others as	startling (and occasionally as disastrous) as the bad bounce of a football. But	it is important to keep in mind that he is an undergraduate because he lives	and works within a specific context--the purposes of his college. The focus of	that total experience which we call "going to college" is the day-to-day	relationship between the undergraduate as a person and the college as an	institutional embodiment of other people's purposes. This relationship is not	easily probed.<p>		<p>		<p>		There are those who tell us that the basic trouble with the liberal arts	college is that it really has no purpose. In this suspicious view, such	institutions are guilty of engaging in a gigantic shell game swindle where	"there ain't any pea" under any of the shells.<p>		<p>		<p>		Without attempting here the impossibility of conclusive proof, I suggest that	the American liberal arts college (including the church colleges) can find a	significant, even unique, mission in the duality of its historic purpose: to	see men made whole in both competence and conscience. Is there any other	institution at the highest level of organized educational activity that is	committed explicitly by its history and by its program to these twin goals?<p>		<p>		<p>		This is not to say that our great professional and technical institutions or	the graduate schools of arts and sciences are something less than the liberal	arts college, but rather that they have set themselves a different task--the	mission of developing a special competence. Nor am I unaware that these	institutions and the liberal arts colleges are borrowing more and more from	each other and may be moving toward each other in approaching a closer	integration of all higher education. But my point is that the historic liberal	arts college has had a unique mission and that this mission has reality and	validity today.<p>		<p>		<p>		There is almost no form or field of learning that does not multiply a man's	power economically, socially, politically, or physically. This is commonplace	because the creation of competence at every level of education is commonplace.	We could hardly stop it if we would. The appetite of self-interest will keep	enough of us hungry for ever larger portions of competence. It is the job of	the college to keep competence civilized.<p>		<p>		<p>		There are many problems and shortcomings in the business of educating for	competence. Mostly they are the problems of any dynamic enterprise: how to do	it better, how to do more. These "how to do" problems trouble the liberal arts	colleges as well as the professional and technical schools; and, up to a point,	I am glad they do, although some fear that for a liberal arts college any	concern of this kind is the shortest route to perdition. I have no interest in	seeing the liberal arts college become too precious for the man who hungers for	competence. He greatly needs the tempering of liberal education; and in turn	such an undergraduate, whether he is heading for medicine, law, engineering,	business, or some other field, by the very fact that he is headed somewhere	brings a healthy reality and vigor to the work of the college. Too many men in	a college who think they know just what they want can make liberal education	too narrowly purposeful. But in order to have the abrasiveness that the	"practical" fellows bring to the campus, I am prepared to take my chances on	this danger and the exasperating troubles it breeds.<p>		<p>		<p>		The risk seems to me worth taking because I am increasingly persuaded that the	cause of liberal education will not be overrun by vocationalism if the college	holds to its birthright and remains committed as a matter of purpose to serious	concern with the issues of conscience. A concern for the choice of good and the	rejection of evil in an institution of liberal learning quickens all humanistic	studies and prevents our increasing reliance on the physical and social	sciences from smothering those intuitive insights which both produce and spring	from goodness in a man.<p>		<p>		<p>		A moral purpose exists for its own sake or it is nothing. I have no thought of	propping it up here with extraneous arguments. I merely offer the observation	that there seems to be a significant natural affinity between the liberating	arts and an educational enterprise committed to the dual pursuit of competence	and conscience. You might call it reciprocal invigoration.<p>		<p>		<p>		To create the power of competence without creating a corresponding sense of	moral direction to guide the use of that power is bad education.<p>		<p>	<br>	<p>	<br>		<b>2.</b><p>		<p>		This is the point in the story where most college catalogue statements of high	purpose end, leaving the blissful impression that the undergraduate and the	moral purpose of his college once met will live happily together ever	afterward. There are more reasons why this is not so than I understand; but, in	fairness to the undergraduate and to the task the liberal arts college has set	itself, there are certain things which ought to be taken into account before he	and the modern college are assumed to be hopelessly immoral and faithless.<p>		<p>		<p>		Consider the raw material on which the college seeks to work a moral purpose.	The undergraduate begins as a boy and leaves as a man. Between the ages of	seventeen and twenty-two he crosses the last dramatic threshold of personal	growth. As a freshman he is sure all things are known or knowable; as a senior	he wonders. I have never known a freshman who sensed the humorous ambiguity in	the advice given a city-bound daughter by her mountaineer father: "When in	doubt, Nell, do right." On the other hand, the sophistication of the senior is	wonderfully caught in the reply of one of them to my tirade on respect for	facts: "Sir, the only trouble with facts is that there are so many of them."<p>		<p>		<p>		In adult life there are new adjustments to be made, new troubles to be met, and	wisdom to be learned, but instead of four there are fifty years or more for	learning the ways of goodness and creating the works of love. And to put it	very mildly adult learning is not handicapped by the fact that it takes place	on the ebb tide of a man's physical appetites and power.<p>		<p>		<p>		The undergraduate on the other hand must make his peace with the moral purposes	of an institution during four hectic years when his appetites and powers are at	flood tide and before he has had much, if any, experience with what can happen.	The lack of intimate personal acquaintance with trouble and tragedy is not, of	course, a condition peculiar to modern youth, but it is the impression of many	of us that most undergraduates today have seen far less of these things than	had their grandfathers or even many of their fathers at the same age. Again	there are many reasons--among them the rising standard of living, the lack of	hard times or widespread business failures in the last ten years, and the	growing urbanization, or sub-urbanization, of the population that heavily	patronizes the liberal arts college.<p>		<p>		<p>		The farm or small-town home where the whole family shared the troubles and	uncertainties of life at all three meals, seven days a week, provided an	earlier exposure to the rough edges of life than does a suburban childhood	topped perhaps by years away at boarding school. The fact that life has narrow	margins also comes earlier in the story for most rural boys. This is not a	lament for the good old days and it is not an appraisal of our many	contemporary advantages; but before we apply the standards of yesterday to the	undergraduate of today, we ought to remember that some basic things in his	pre-college experience are very different.<p>		<p>		<p>		I shall forgo here any attempt to compare the pre-college church background of	today's youth with yesterday's, but I do want to mention one more changing	reality that seems to me to have a very sharp bearing on the undergraduate's	readiness for the deep spiritual insights of humility, compassion, and faith.	Today's freshman was only seven at the end of World War II and he was too young	for Korea. He brings to college a very dim and impersonal notion of death.<p>		<p>		<p>		It is increasingly probable that he comes to college without having known the	immeasurable grief which falls on a boy with the death of a parent, a brother,	a sister, or of a grandparent living in the same household. The terror of	diphtheria epidemics is unknown to him; he is rarely wrenched from college by	the death of a father. Modern medicine pushes death further and further up the	years, both for those who go and those who stay. In a time when each young	family goes off to its own home, when hospitalization of the sick increasingly	takes illness and death out of the home, and when the practice of holding	funerals in the home has almost passed, young people know little of shared	suffering and are kept at arm's length from the crush of death. How many boys	now coming to college have lived day in and day out with a grandparent dying on	the parlor sofa?<p>		<p>		<p>		You may well say with me, "Thank God for this." But can we doubt that deep	personal experience with the reality that every life ends and that, with all	our knowing, there are earthly bounds beyond which there is no knowing--can we	doubt that these are the ingredients out of which honest humility, compassion,	and faith become personal to the human self? An undergraduate who has not yet	known these things in his own life can sometimes borrow from the total store of	human woe and joy, and by using the tools of the intellect he can begin to lay	out a pattern of belief for himself, but it will be a sharper etching after the	bite of life's acid is on it.<p>		<p>		<p>		Moreover, one of the very tools he must use can cause an undergraduate to feel	that the liberal arts college is at war with itself, and that there is an	irreconcilable contradiction between its approach to competence and its	approach to conscience. The name of that tool is doubt. The tool of doubt is	simply indispensable to the fashioning of the kind of critical mind that does	the daily intellectual work of the world. Any fact, any assumption, any theory,	that has not been tested by the diamond-pointed drill of doubt is at best a	doubtful thing. Almost every good teacher at some point takes the calculated	risk of pressing this tool into the hands of his undergraduate students. Most	of them learn to handle and respect it as a tool, but there are always some	who, for a time at least, insist on treating doubt as an end in itself.	Likewise, I think, many undergraduates go through a phase of being genuinely	perplexed because the use of doubt does not produce uniformly satisfying	results in all situations.<p>		<p>	<br>	<p>	<br>		<b>3.</b><p>		<p>		Today's undergraduate--and for that matter today's college teacher--is not much	interested in the type of science versus religion wrestling match that drew so	well on many campuses in the twenties. He is quite willing to leave that	argument where it fell of its own futility. You can, of course, hear almost	anything on any campus if you listen long enough, but generally the questions	today seem more manageable: What is science? How far can it reach? Are	different religions compatible? Is religion really livable? Is it "for me"?	And, as always, there is the large, relatively silent sector of opinion which	believes in letting your mind alone about such things. For these fellows the	religious practice or indifference of their fathers is good enough.<p>		<p>		<p>		I am often asked whether there is not greater interest in religion on the	campus today than during the pre-war period. Such judgments are at best	imprecise, but so far as I can judge, the answer is yes. On our campus we see	such intensified interest in the classroom, the chapel, and the Christian	Union. Student attendance and activity in the local churches have sharply	increased. This manifestation of growing religious interest on the campus	undoubtedly reflects in part what is happening throughout American society, but	I am sure there is also in it a factor indigenous to the college.<p>		<p>		<p>		Even though there is no great debate between science and religion as competing	absolutes on the campus today, a goodly percentage of freshmen and sophomores	can be counted on to keep their parents harried about religious matters. It has	ever been thus, and I feel certain that so long as disciplined doubt is one of	the mind's tools it will always be thus--at least until the last apprenticeship	has been served in these workshops of the mind. This seems to me healthy as	well as inevitable, and I commend those who need reassurance to President	William Jewett Tucker, who, after a lifetime of preaching and teaching, wrote:	"The doubting mind always seemed to me a part of the believing mind." The	understanding of such paradox is the fruit of full maturity, rarely, if ever,	within the reach of any undergraduate.<p>		<p>		<p>		Whatever the reason, an undergraduate often hesitates to accept moral and	spiritual commitments that seem to him to limit his free-wheeling	maneuverability of either body or soul. I respect and value this instinct as a	reaction to unexamined dogma. However, I think I also know something of its	perverse possibilities as a subterfuge for an unwillingness to examine, and as	a form of chronic immaturity. These are ancient foes of education; they are	hard to live with even when you are paid to do it, and they are harder to	cure.<p>		<p>		<p>		The undergraduate of the days before yesterday was not quite all that as an	alumnus he now thinks he was, but as a general thing he probably was ready to	commit himself earlier and more rigidly on moral and spiritual issues. He	personally often felt the need of such commitment earlier, and such commitments	fell right into the general pattern of his family and community life. Any	commitment comes easier if everyone is doing it. Whatever the reasons, for some	time now, not everybody is doing it, and as a consequence today's undergraduate	feels very much more on his own in working his way through these things.	Working out such commitments on your own builds self-reliance. It is, however,	difficult, even dangerous, and it certainly takes more time. It is a lonely	business and today's undergraduate is often more lonely than he admits or we	realize.<p>		<p>		<p>		But nothing could be more foolish and unjust than to assume that today's	undergraduate does not respond positively and in distinctive ways to a moral	challenge. Within the reality of his experience he is ready, willing, and able	to come to grips with issues of conscience which in other days were largely	left to his elders. During the past ten years I have watched our post-war	undergraduates face up to problems of conscience in passing hard disciplinary	judgments on fellow students, in taking their own measure on the issues of	racial discrimination and the honor system, and in meeting the easy-to-duck	challenges of such things as the campus community chest, the needs of DP	students, and the unadvertised troubles of some hard-pressed North countryman	in the outlying community. It is no false bravery to say that having watched	both his doing of these things and his contagion for trouble, I am prepared to	take my chances with the kind of world the undergraduate creates when he works	at it.<p>		<p>		<p>		And he does work at it. It is a common thing for our undergraduate committee	handling the investigation and recommendations on disciplinary cases to sit	into the early morning hours of the night. There is no duty on a modern campus	more distasteful to an undergraduate than sitting in judgment on the	shortcomings of his peers. He is keenly aware that "but for the grace of God,	there go I" and he probably still retains a strong trace of the American	schoolboy's loyalty to the group as against the authority of the school. And	yet I have never known an outgoing undergraduate judiciary chairman whose	capacity for both compassion and just judgment was not admired, indeed envied,	by students and faculty alike.<p>		<p>		<p>		Recently this committee sat until 2 A.M. considering whether to recommend the	dismissal from college of a boy who had gotten himself into serious trouble. It	was a hard case all around, and it was only after an independent investigation,	a hearing of the boy, and lengthy deliberation that the committee finally	decided the interests of the college required dismissal of the student. Before	he went to bed that night the undergraduate chairman on his own initiative	called on the boy's parents at the Inn to report the decision and to give them	the kind of explanation he would have wanted his parents to get if he were	being dismissed. This is more than responsibility; this is conscience.<p>		<p>		<p>		It is not the leaders alone who measure up. On things such as racial	discrimination and compulsory military service every man must face himself as	well as the nation and his Maker. Today's undergraduate has no choice about	going or not going into the armed forces. He must go, but his attitude in going	is important. At Dartmouth, we who have worked with all our seniors in the	Great Issues Course know that today's senior goes into the service of his	country understanding far more than did his father or grandfather why he does	so. He knows why it is all so necessary and yet so unnecessary. He puts two or	three years of his life into what he is told needs to be done without becoming	embittered, without retreating either to "know-nothingism" or pacifism, and	with a growing awareness of the role of conscience in all his doing.<p>		<p>		<p>		An undergraduate generation capable of coming to terms with itself and its	elders on the issues of man's brotherhood is surely capable in the course of a	lifetime of coming to terms with the universe as children of God.<p>		<p>	<br>	<p>	<br>		<b>4.</b><p>		<p>		Is today's college as well prepared as it should be to meet these needs of	conscience? When it comes to commitments, the independent college itself has a	problem. It has a long history of fighting clear of doctrinal commitments and	for good reasons. Yet a college cannot take its problems of purpose seriously	without venturing into some form of institutional commitment. The early	American colleges were generally very clear about their commitment to a moral	and religious purpose. For several hundred years the primacy of this purpose	was both attested and served by three constitutional elements in the life of	these colleges: 1) the tradition of preacher presidents, 2) a curriculum heavy	with religion and moral doctrine, and 3) compulsory church and chapel. I refer	to these elements as "constitutional" because for a long period, above and	beyond men, their influence permeated all that these institutions were and did.	But, as with other mortal constitutional forms, they proved susceptible of	amendment and not as permanent as they had seemed to earlier generations.	Certainly it is a rare thing today to find any college, except those	institutions which are integral parts of a church, where the moral purpose of	higher education continues to be attested by this triad of constitutional	witnesses.<p>		<p>		<p>		The time has passed on most campuses for arguing the merits of these changes;	they are done and in the main they were in response to serious weaknesses and	real needs. There is little or no prospect that any of these elements could be	re-established intact today. many do believe that college chapel in some form	still has a future. I hope so and I should personally be sorry to see it	abandoned or weakened on those campuses where it still exists even though in	greatly modified form from the rigors and requirements of yesterday.<p>		<p>		<p>		The deeper significance of these traditions has become apparent only as we	begin to be aware that with the passing of these constitutional elements from	the campus, the college's concern for conscience was left without tangible,	pervasive, and enduring witness. Nothing comparable was substituted for the	outmoded agencies, and this gap in the context of purpose remains an	uncorrected weakness on most undergraduate campuses today. This seems to me to	be clear unless we are ready to say either 1) that the college's historic	commitment to furthering the moral and spiritual growth of an undergraduate	truly ceased with the passing of these particular witnesses, or 2) that in	serving this purpose we can rely exclusively on the ebb and flow of its	awareness in individual teachers and administrators rather than on the more	traditional combination of men plus the prod of institutional form and purpose.	Either of these seem to me bad education.<p>		<p>		<p>		The challenge of this problem is to get beyond words. In an effort to be	concretely responsive we have done three things at Dartmouth:--<p>		<p>		<p>		First, the Board of Trustees has formally affirmed that the College's "moral	and spiritual purpose springs from a belief in the existence of good and evil,	from faith in the ability of men to choose between them and from a sense of	duty to advance the good."<p>		<p>		<p>		Secondly, the Trustees by the same resolution established an independent	endowment within the College to be known as the William Jewett Tucker	Foundation for the specific purpose of supporting and furthering in all ways	and in all areas the moral and spiritual work of the College.<p>		<p>		<p>		Thirdly, the Trustees have created a new position of pervasive scope, to be	known as the Dean of the Tucker Foundation, the occupant of which will have the	campus as well as the chapel for his province.<p>		<p>		<p>		The Tucker Foundation takes its aim and scope from the outlook of Dr. Tucker,	Dartmouth's last preacher president and one of the greatest, who at the turn of	the century spoke thus in the College chapel:--<p>		<p>		"I make no closing plea for any formal religion, but I do plead now as always	for the religious spirit....Seek, I pray you, moral distinction. Be not content	with the commonplace in character any more than with the commonplace in	ambition or intellectual attainment. Do not expect that you will make any	lasting or very strong impression on the world through intellectual power	without the use of an equal amount of conscience and heart."<p>		<p>		<p>		There are no panaceas in education and I claim no patentable novelty for the	individual features of the Tucker Foundation. Taken together, however, I wonder	if they do not add up to an approach that is genuinely responsive to the	problem of keeping conscience to the fore as an indispensable ingredient of an	education that can commit a man to a better life as he liberates himself from a	lesser one.<p>		<p>		<p>		Here on the side of conscience in the broadest and firmest terms is an explicit	commitment of purpose. So long as our society places its bet on the power of	free men to choose their destiny, such a commitment will be relevant. It is	built low to the ground but it looks up, and I should think that it has a good	chance to remain resilient and meaningful under well-nigh any future	circumstance. Here also is a store of material resources which, joined with the	avowal of purpose, will stand as a tangible reminder to the students, teachers,	alumni, presidents, and trustees of tomorrow that they are committed to the	work of righteousness and that it is their task to fashion tools appropriate to	their day. Finally, here in the deanship of the Tucker Foundation is a position	of both scope and prestige which, while rooted in the religious spirit, could	open to its occupant the kind of intimate but wide-ranging relationship to the	campus that our highly departmentalized colleges so badly need. Incidentally,	such a representative-at-large might well accomplish some of the college-wide	missions the preacher presidents were able to perform in their day which a	present-day college president is kept from doing because of his amphibious	existence, half on and half off the campus.<p>		<p>		<p>		Up to now I have spoken of competence and conscience as if they were the twain	that never get closer than the opposite sides of that ubiquitous thing called	"and." This cleavage is not the reality either on or off the campus. It is the	mixture that counts, and among our other blessings I rate very highly the fact	that in the liberal arts college neither competence nor conscience is taken	straight. Rather, it is the human interplay between these two poles of purpose	that gives liberal education its orientation to the light and brings to the	undergraduate grown a man those liberating and civilizing qualities men never	quite define nor ever quite deny. 	</blockquote><hr><pre></pre><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1955 by John Sloan Dickey.

There seems to be no	doubt that the facts bear out the allegation. Occasionally this undoubted	irreligion becomes vocal, as in the case of the man who lately wrote for the	Atlantic Monthly the account of what happened to his faith while he was at	Harvard ['What College Did to My Religion' by Philip E. Wentworth, June, 1932].	But more often religion is simply ignored. It is quite true that students talk	a great deal about it, rather strangely much if it be as dead a thing as they	commonly insist. 'Bull sessions' turn to it as the most usual alternative to	talk about sex. But this chatter is for the most part vague and uninformed, and	gets nowhere. Probably that is why it makes such an excellent subject for those	interminable bickerings which undergraduates substitute for intelligent	conversation.<p>		<p>		<p>		But religion as a subject for serious intellectual concern enjoys no vogue	among the great majority in university halls. It is rarely a subject for	serious study, and the students are conspicuously absent from worship.	Systematic spiritual culture they almost never undertake. Most of them appear	to be ignorant that there is such a thing. Expected attendance at chapel is for	the most part gone, nor has voluntary association with religious bodies taken	its place. University alumni are not commonly to be found among those who	support, by personal activity or otherwise, the religious bodies of America.	These are facts, to be faced by honest men.<p>		<p>		<p>		It is, to be sure, quite possible to maintain that these things are the	necessary result of modern enlightenment; that to believe in God and to adore	Him are incompatible with scientific ways of thinking; that religion is merely	a curious survival of primitive superstition. If anyone desires to explain	things that way, it is permitted him; but to most thinking people such a	contention seems somehow too simple to be quite true. For countless generations	man has sought to approach Truth by way of three experiences: the scientific,	which has to do with what the senses may show; the artistic, which reveals	truth and beauty through creative activity; and the religious, which consists	of intuitions of personality. It seems an odd thing that all of a sudden man	should have found out that the first of these (plus a tolerated, though not	much respected, use of the second) is valid, while the third, equally	instinctive to mankind, equally venerable, and equally a part of racial	experience, has become absurd.<p>		<p>		<p>		There are those who remember, with more than a little distress, how the Middle	Ages ignored one of the modes of experience, the scientific, to its great	deprivation. Bowing religion out, as of no possible validity, seems also a	little supercilious, and dangerous. An experience attested by all the ages	probably has something to it. That it may safely be ignored or laughed at, by	any individual or culture, would seem to need some proving. If it is to be	abandoned, the forsaking of it should be a last resort, not something to be	accepted with nonchalance and gayety, in the typical undergraduate manner.<p>		<p>	<br>	<p>	<br>		<b>II</b><p>		<p>		As a matter of fact, modern scientific thought does not prevent a belief in God	or the practice of religion, not by a very great deal. Nor are the greatest	leaders of science the ones who despise the faith. Newton was a convinced	Christian. Laplace, Laennec, and Pasteur were faithful Roman Catholics. Dalton	was a devout Friend. Galvani was a Franciscan tertiary. Ampere sympathetically	and regularly read Thomas a Kempis. Faraday was a lay preacher, and J.C.	Maxwell a Presbyterian elder. Romanes and Claude Bernard reasoned their way	into Christianity. Lister died a faithful communicant. Fabre was a mystic, who	said that atheism was a mania. Kelvin saw no incompatibility between his	science and a faithful and regular worship of God. One could multiply such	examples. Even Darwin was a theist, as may be seen by anyone who reads the last	paragraph of the Origin of Species.<p>		<p>		<p>		All of these men are now dead; but it is notorious that many of their	successors of the moment are so anxious to promote the consideration of	spiritual values that they all too frequently tumble into print, some of them	exhibiting more zeal than knowledge in profession of faith in that which passes	scientific knowing. As for philosophy, it is not merely such men as Maritain	and Wust and Streeter and Hocking who are in revolt against mechano-morphism.	The thing is clean gone out of fashion, except in American undergraduate	colleges. It will hardly do, in the face of the facts, to explain collegiate	indifference to religion on the ground of intellectual necessity. It is not	modern thought that is to blame.<p>		<p>		<p>		Nor is it, perhaps, the individual undergraduate who is altogether at fault.	Youth is always conformist, more so than childhood or middle age. The	undergraduate hates to be eccentric, or even to seem so. Half of the problems	of college education are conditioned by this undergraduate prejudice against	originality or independence of thought. The college student therefore reflects,	quite naturally and understandably, the current notion that only those things	are important which advance worldly position. Our generation ignores religion	as far as possible, because to do so enables men and women to avoid	interference with impulses engendered by cupidity. Contemporary civilization is	largely built upon the basic idea that the world may become any man's oyster.	It is the Zeitgeist which impels our students to a profound reverence for	acquisitiveness.<p>		<p>		<p>		Not that the universities fail to assist in this. More than a little they help	to debase their undergraduate: by an all too eager surrender to the popular	opinion that an educated man is merely one who can do and get things; by an	overemphasis on expansion in numbers and extravagance in building and ballyhoo	generally; by the making of men into bachelors and masters of arts when they	happen to be merely technicians, and doctors of philosophy for most	unphilosophical achievements; by a fawning upon potential benefactors,	regardless of whether or not they are men and women of any discrimination. The	universities, too, have been swimming with the tide.<p>		<p>		<p>		It is not merely religion from consideration of which undergraduates are	distracted by such unacademic antics. All thought about ultimates suffers	together. Philosophy is disparaged. Even science itself has come to appear to	the student eye not so much a method of arriving at truth as a means to an end,	which end is the larger production of things and the mightier accumulation of	cash. All true scholarship is injured by greed; but religion suffers most.	Science can be exploited, and is therefore to be respected. Religion does not	pay, and therefore may safely be ignored--in fact, had better be ignored. That	is the simple and ugly explanation of a large part of student loss of faith in	God and spiritual culture.<p>		<p>		<p>		For all this let us blame the mores; but let us also fault the universities for	a passive and profitable surrender to the mores. There is something cancerous	in higher education as we have it in America. Perhaps the tissue has become	diseased from too rapid growth and too rich food. Possibly a diet of depression	will not hurt, although one has a slight misgiving that in the course of the	next few years it will be the cultural rather than the applied side of	scholarship that will suffer most. It may be that some major surgery is a bit	overdue.<p>		<p>	<br>	<p>	<br>		<b>III</b><p>		<p>		The degradation of university ideals does not, however, fully explain the	religious indifference of undergraduates. Sometimes it is those very students	who are most in revolt against the current immorality, off campus and on (that	ethics which defines the good life in terms of possessions and pleasure), who	are least concerned with spiritual experience. They know what they hate and	despise, but they are not aware that religion is as rebellious as they. It is	not too much to venture a guess that one thing which is wrong is that American	universities fail to inform their students about the nature of the spiritual	enterprise. Many of them have no faculties of theology at all; and where such	faculties do exist they are commonly isolated from undergraduate teaching and	from vital contact with colleagues in other fields of knowledge. It has come to	pass that theology is looked upon as a professional subject. Nothing could be	more unfortunate for balanced thought.<p>		<p>		<p>		Religion is as basic a discipline as science, and as reputable intellectually.	Yet it is possible for a student in almost any of our leading universities to	read for his primary degree, and his advanced degrees, without gaining even a	suspicion of that fact. Consequently, we have such astonishing attitudes of	mind as that of the young Harvard man to whose Atlantic Monthly article	reference has been made. He seems to be reasonably intelligent, not at all	incapable of understanding religion. The trouble is that he apparently has no	knowledge of what religion is. He has outgrown a crude and semi-magical concept	of God, such as a child may properly hold, with no realization that grown men	mean by religion something both more delicate and more complex. As a lad he was	a Presbyterian. As a man he knows nothing of the profound and penetrating	studies of religion made by the Scottish theologians, or by such American	Presbyterians as Dr. Buttrick and Dr. Coffin and Dr. W. A. Brown, to take only	three outstanding examples. He scorns the devotions conducted at the shrine of	Sainte Anne de Beaupre, which are for persons of childlike mind; but he ignores	the magnificent work of modern Roman Catholic thinkers. The man is	ignorant--and he ought not to be. His university should have brought him into	contact with religious thinkers comparable to those whom he has met within the	fields of science, history, and art.<p>		<p>		<p>		They mystical side of experience and its contribution to an understanding of	the universe are not commonly regarded by American universities as necessary	fields of undergraduate study. Religion has next to no place in their	curricula, or in their other official activities. This is, or ought to be, a	matter of common knowledge, but an instance in point may be cited.<p>		<p>		<p>		In 1925, at Harvard, the Student Council appointed a committee to look into and	report upon certain aspects of education at that university from the	undergraduate point of view. This was done, and the findings of the student	committee were published in the Harvard Advocate for April 1926. Among other	things, the report recommended that a new kind of required course be made	available which would include the study, not merely of philosophy, but also of	religion. It stated: 'It becomes urgently necessary that the college teach the	business of life in all its aspects'; and again: 'The committee recommends the	innovation of including the philosophy of Christianity in the work of the	course. This suggestion is not made in a missionary or crusading spirit, but is	dictated as a remedy for the prevailing ignorance concerning so important a	subject.'<p>		<p>		<p>		The committee of students made many excellent suggestions, and almost all of	them have subsequently been adopted by Harvard College, including the one	mentioned. It is only fair to observe, however, that the college authorities	acted upon this specific recommendation in such a manner as to defeat, in large	measure, what appears to have been the primary object of the Student Council in	sponsoring it. The new course has, indeed, been added to the curriculum, but it	is only a half course, and, instead of being required for a degree, it is	optional and actually limited to two hundred students. Under these conditions	it is obvious that the very students who most need the instruction which the	new course offers will be the last to avail themselves of it.<p>		<p>		<p>		This half-hearted acceptance by the college authorities of the suggestion which	the student committee appears to have considered most important stands in	strange contrast to their complete adoption of other suggestions of far less	moment which were advanced in the same report. The Student Council committee	went on to ask, for example, that the overgrown college be divided into smaller	units, and this has subsequently been effected on a grand scale, at the cost of	more than twelve million dollars. Such is the confusion of values in American	universities.<p>		<p>		<p>		It is unjust, perhaps, to single out Harvard. It is safe to say that most of	our universities have been even less alert to their responsibilities in this	direction, with the exception of parts of Columbia and the University of	Chicago, where Dean Shailer Mathews has persuaded the authorities at least	partially to face this fundamental problem. It is a too common custom in	American universities to expend millions on brick and mortar while, in matters	vitally important in their bearing upon education, faculty action lags behind	common need and student demand.<p>		<p>	<br>	<p>	<br>		<b>IV</b><p>			<p>		Under such circumstances, it is hardly reasonable to expect that students	should know much of anything about religion. This neglect of a great segment of	knowledge is partly due to the example set by our state-supported institutions,	which are compelled by law to eliminate form official consideration any serious	study of the spiritual life; but it is also caused by a feeling on the part of	those who direct our educational policies that religion is a non-intellectual	and relatively unimportant activity of the human race. Such a position, in the	light of human history, is more than a little absurd. The search for God has	always been one of man's chief concerns. The race has known that there were	some things which it could find out only by scientific observation, others	discoverable only by creative activity, and still others--and these the deepest	and most subtle--to be mastered only by that seeking of ultimate Reality in	personal terms which is religion. To ignore any of these basic human	disciplines is dangerous, but to ignore religion is apt to be the most harmful	of all. The cultivation of science without religion will always become pregnant	with the sort of cynicism which once brought Greek thinking to a despairing	close, from which the reintroduction of religion alone revived it. It is this	very sort of cynicism which increasingly characterizes the intellectual life of	the twentieth century. For the health of human thought, religious experience	needs consideration by our universities.<p>		<p>		The words 'religious experience' seem better to use here than the word	'religion,' because that word 'religion' is apt to be divorced from experience	and given a derivative meaning. Religion is not itself a philosophy of	religion, a formulation of religion, an organization of religion. Dogma, while	immensely important, is actually a generalization of religious experience.	Ecclesiastical organization is significant only because it is an attempt to	preserve opportunities for religious experience. Religion is a way of living in	terms of contact with Reality, personally conceived. If we do not give to men a	knowledge of the technique involved in religious experience, we deprive them of	part of their birthright.<p>		<p>		<p>		There are many people to whom such statements as these will have no meaning	whatever. Their minds are closed; they are fantastic and fanatic in their	intellectual lopsidedness. There is no use discussing with such persons the	place of religion in an educational programme. But there are many, increasingly	more, who will realize the truth of what has been said. Among them will be	found not merely church people but many who have no connection with any church;	not merely ecclesiastical enthusiasts, but also poets, philosophers,	non-behavioristic psychologists, and a good many of the most eminent	scientists; people who see life without bias, who realize that religion is not	magic, not merely morality, but rather a seeking for what the mind cannot	otherwise grasp. Perhaps we may hope for a day when such persons may determine	the policies of our American institutions of higher learning.<p>			<p><br><p><br>	<i>Bernard Iddings Bell is	Professor of Religion at Columbia University and Warden of St. Stephen's	College.</i></blockquote><hr>	<pre></pre><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1932 by Bernard Iddings Bell.

The offer of appointment was	cabled to me at Manila, where I was on duty with my troops. The Governor had	not been consulted and, when advised of the appointment, frankly said he did	not approve; but the members of his Board of Control were not politicians and	he bowed to their judgment and confirmed the appointment. That portion of the	press which can think of such jobs only as rewards for the faithful had told	their readers that my army record was that of a harsh, cruel disciplinarian; in	fact, I was a cold-blooded martinet, who would soon require the output of an	iron foundry to supply balls and chains. The inmates would again appear in	striped uniforms, and the rawhide would be worked overtime. <p>		<p>		<p>		No scene of my entire life has left such an impression upon me as that first	meeting with those men who had come under my charge. Those twelve hundred	upturned, pale faces showed so clearly that the souls back of them were again	facing sentence, that I had difficulty in getting started. <p>		<p>		<p>		My talk was along the same lines that I had so frequently employed in	addressing the soldiers of my troop whenever any new work was to undertaken.	Men always perform better when they understand what is to be done, and how,	when, and why. They can act so much more intelligently, and since no manager	can foresee all the details, it renders it so simple for the subordinates to	use the human intelligence, which most of them possess, when anything slips a	cog.<p>		<p>		<p>		Well, it was an experience of a lifetime to watch the general and gradual	change in expression--first confusion, then doubt, then hope, and finally	contentment, as far as that expression can be registered upon the faces of	convicts. <p>		<p>		<p>		I made no promises and offered no threats. I aimed to establish a man-to-man	recognition of a relationship through which future events could be interpreted	and understood. The gratifying response of the men when I finished left no	doubt in my mind that I was understood and would have the cooperation of the	vast majority.<p>		<p>		<p>		I have been referring to an event in the Michigan State Prison, at Jackson, in	December 1916. My predecessor had rendered splendid services, and when I	undertook to succeed him, the prison at Jackson had been improved far beyond	the average American institution in almost every phase of its management and	methods. This made my job doubly difficult; and I was one hundred per cent	novice in penology.<p>		<p>		<p>		The war came; the War Department offered me an assignment, and I returned to	the army after directing the affairs at Jackson Prison for nine months. Those	nine months do not qualify me to speak as an expert; but I can speak with at	least that much more experience than the average man, who is wondering what is	wrong.<p>		<p>		<p>		I relinquished that job at Jackson with the greatest regret. I went there	because I had confidence in the possibility of showing the way to another and	better method, the beneficial effects of which I believed would be felt in	every factory, office, school, and home in America. I left Jackson believing	that great things could be accomplished and with some very definite ideas as to	how it could be done.<p>		<p>		<p>		Fundamentally, I believe it wrong to regard a prison as a place of punishment.	It is absurd for a judge or jury, who probably never saw the accused before his	trial, to fix the period of his incarceration. It is just as ridiculous to	release a thief, pickpocket, forger, robber, burglar, or any other criminal,	just because he has served a fixed number of years, as it would be to release a	raving maniac because he has been in an asylum a certain period of time.<p>		<p>		<p>		I believe that it is not possible to treat a man as a caged animal for months	and years, and then expect him to conduct himself as a normal being after	sudden release, permitting him to circulate freely in society. <p>		<p>		<p>		**No convicted criminal should be set free, regardless of his offense or the	time he has been held in restraint, until he has been prepared to earn a	living, has acquired habits of industry, has the desire to become a useful	member of society, and has proved to the satisfaction of the head of his	institution that he has the will-power to realize that desire; and finally	until suitable employment has been found for him, in a place where he has	opportunities equal to other men.<p>		<p>		<p>		The reputation, success, and worth of the head of a state prison should be	measured by the number of men that he graduates out of his institution who	prove they are qualified to remain outside.<p>		<p>		<p>		The head of a penal institution is more important to the progress of society	than the president of a university. His task is more difficult: he must be more	resourceful; he must have a combination of culture, education, business	ability, and personal character of the highest order; all backed up by a	physique that will carry him through continuous experiences such as will break	the health, vision, and optimism of most men.<p>		<p>		<p>		The time has come to do away with the title of 'warden' and the designations of	'prison,' 'penitentiary,' and the rest, and to start a new and enlightened era	with a 'President of State Industries.'**<p>		<p>		<p>		In 1910 there were 2823 penal institutions in the United States, from which	476,468 persons were discharged. The records indicate that more than sixty per	cent of those discharged soon find their way back into prison. Of course, many	of the remainder repeat their crimes, and do not get caught.<p>		<p>		<p>		Measure the cost if you can. Probably more than sixty per cent of the cost of	our police forces, criminal courts, jails, prisons, losses due to theft,	murder, and so forth, is avoidable.<p>		<p>		<p>		Certainly, this is a subject worthy of the time and effort of our best minds.<p>		<p>		<p>		<font size=4><b>II.</font></b><p>		<p>		I approached my problem at Jackson with a wide-open mind. I knew that I had	been in contact with men all my life, here and there, who had committed crimes,	probably as many and as serious as the men under my charge at Jackson; but they	had not been caught. My first decision, therefore, was to treat the inmates	just as I would any ordinary individuals who had work to do inside the prison,	except that, since it was my sworn duty to keep them inside, I had to enforce	such regulations as would accomplish that result.<p>		<p>		<p>		I knew that a sound and healthy body is essential to mental health and	development, and, naturally, I gave this subject my first attention. I was	shocked by the pale complexions of those faces that I saw the first day. By the	very simple expedients of ventilating the cell blocks, exercising the men out	of doors, and giving them a forty-minute period of complete relaxation in the	open air after the noon meal each day, the great majority, in the course of two	weeks, were so much improved in appearance and cheerfulness, that members of	the Board were surprised on their next visit, and commented upon it.<p>		<p>		<p>		The next effort toward better health, mental and physical, was to give the men	the freedom of the yard on Sundays and holidays, instead of keeping them in	their cells. Then they were encouraged to read all newspapers and magazines,	and restrictions on correspondence were removed, as to volume. Later on, a	scientific diet was provided in the mess hall.<p>		<p>		<p>		As soon as possible, the bathing facilities were increased, so that each man	could have his daily shower bath; and it was so close to his bunk that he could	get there without dressing, put on his night clothing, and get to bed.<p>		<p>		<p>		Later on, a tuberculosis colony was started on a farm about four miles form the	prison, and every man who had that disease was sent to live there. These men	were not guarded, but were on their honor not to run away. Suitable fresh-air	dormitories were provided, and the medical officer visited the colony daily.	The least disabled cared for the farm, live stock, cooking and other necessary	work about the place.<p>		<p>		<p>		The sick report of the inmate population fell to an average of 1.3 per cent of	the whole.<p>		<p>		<p>		When I went to Jackson, the institution was on a self-supporting basis, having	been brought up to that condition by the admirable work of my predecessor. All	inmates who were able to work were paid for their services, the pay ranging	from ten cents to $1.50 per day. Considering that this was in addition to	shelter, bed, heat, light, clothing, food, use of library, entertainment,	schooling, religious services, and medical attention, it was not a poor rate of	payment. But any rate of payment was opposed, and relentlessly fought by	powerful interests from several directions.<p>		<p>		<p>		Approximately half of the inmates attended school regularly five evenings each	week, and I need only say that 363 of the students--more than one fourth of the	entire population of the prison--were enrolled in the first, second, and third	grades, to indicate one cause of crime: ignorance.<p>		<p>		<p>		It was my purpose to continue and perfect the system which I found in	operation, and of which I thoroughly approved.  <p>		<p>		<p>		The prison owned approximately 3000 acres of farm land, and I purchased 2000	more. There were some nine colonies of farmers (convicts) living permanently on	the farms and operating them--an average of 350 men were so employed. The farms	were equipped with modern machinery, and afforded all phases of agricultural	training for the men.<p>		<p>		<p>		We had hundreds of cattle, hogs, chickens, horses, and sheep, and 200 colonies	of honeybees. We operated three dairy barns, of fifty cows each, and bred	excellent strains of horses, cattle, hogs, and chickens.<p>		<p>		<p>		Our farms provided for our mess-hall requirements in the way of eggs, milk,	butter, meat, fruit, and vegetables; and a very fine cannery packed thousands	of cases of peas, beans, beets, corn, kraut, and fruit, all of which was either	used in the prison kitchen or sold to the public at attractive prices.<p>		<p>		<p>		Other industries under the entire ownership of the prison and constituting a	part of the warden's business responsibility were:--<p>		<p>		<p>		A monument works, in which some fifty or sixty men were profitably employed	carving granite monuments, made to order.<p>		<p>		<p>		A brick-and-tile works, where common building-brick and farm-drain tile were	made in large quantities.<p>		<p>		<p>		A tannery, in which the hides from steers butchered for the kitchens were made	into belting and leather, for use in the making of inmates' shoes.<p>		<p>		<p>		Then there was the twine factory, making 14,000,000 lbs. of binder twine each	year, and profitably employing over 300 men.<p>		<p>		<p>		In service departments, necessary to the maintenance of all the above, we had	the laundry, tailor-shop, shoe-shop, machine-shop, creamery, power-house,	planing-mill, and carpenter-shop. The engineer, with his drafting rooms, gave	excellent opportunities to a considerable number of men. The inmates' store,	the factory offices, the general storehouse, and the business offices, were all	largely manned by inmates, and the labor turnover was low.<p>		<p>		<p>		It must be a poor business man who cannot pay expenses under such labor	conditions; and our statement for the fiscal year, ending June 30, 1917, showed	a net profit of $156,000. This after paying ALL the expenses of the	institution, making proper allowances for depreciation of buildings and	machinery, paying wages to all inmates, providing them with food, clothing,	schooling, shelter, medical service, entertainment, and religion, and also	after paying the salaries of all officers employed.<p>		<p>		<p>		The operating profit for July, August, September, and October, 1917, was over	$300,000; and there is no reason whatever why the institution should not make a	good big net profit each year, and give a reasonable part to the inmates, to	add to their stake when they are discharged, or to distribute to their	dependent relatives while they are in prison.<p>		<p>		<p>		<font size=4><b>III.</font></b><p>		<p>		From the above it might seem that the problem of prisoners and prisons had	found its solution.<p>		<p>		<p>		There were no idle men; all were employed at a useful occupation, all	participated in the profits, and had a fair incentive to give an honest effort;	their health was improving; over twenty-five per cent of them were almost free	men, working on farms several miles from the main prison; some 200 men lived in	a dormitory, in large rooms of three or four beds each, had their toilet	facilities in each room, and could talk and play games, as any normal men might	care to do. The spirit of the men was good, and everywhere there was as good a	feeling as we ordinarily find among large numbers living in restraint.<p>		<p>		<p>		But we were a long way from a solution of the prison, or crime, problem.<p>		<p>		<p>		The officers were not very useful in setting examples to the inmates, and it	was extremely difficult to interest the right class of men,--intelligent,	courageous, and strong natural leaders,--to take employment as officers.<p>		<p>		<p>		Every now and then some fellow would get into trouble, just as they do in	churches, colleges, or business houses. He was already in prison; sometimes his	sentence was for life. What are you going to do with a man facing ten years or	more in prison, who sticks his knife in the side of a fellow convict? Or	suppose he only strikes another man with his fist, and he is given a good	talking to, and shown how he can get along better if he attends to his own	business and keeps out of trouble; and within twenty-four hours he is caught	breaking another convict's skull with a brick--what are you going to do? The	only criticism I have to make of Mr. Tannenbaum's article is that he parades	all the punishments before his readers, but he doesn't give any answer to that	question.<p>		<p>		<p>		In my opinion there are but three possible methods of dealing with such	cases:--<p>		<p>		<p>		If the man is sane, healthy, and merely a trouble-maker, he should be paddled	until the impression left upon his memory will be sufficient to deter him when	he is again tempted to take advantage of his superior strength, to injure	another. Sometimes a dark cell, or bread and water, get better results than the	paddle. But that is the only language such fellows understand; and if you want	peace in a prison-yard, and to protect the decent fellows, you have got to talk	the language that the bully understands until he learns a more polite one.<p>		<p>		<p>		Possibly the man is mentally weak and unbalanced. If so, he belongs in a	sanitarium, and should be sent there and not punished.<p>		<p>		<p>		Then we have the hardened, confirmed, deliberate criminal, who has a good mind,	appreciates the gravity of his acts, and, doing so, would kill a man for	twenty-five cents. That sort of a chap, when found out, belongs in a separate	place, from which there is no chance of escape, and in which he cannot	interfere with the great majority of convicts, whose regeneration seems	hopeful.<p>		<p>		<p>		<p>		<p>		This brings me to one of the big steps which I believe must be taken in the	solution of the crime and prison problem:--<p>		<p>		<p>		Under existing laws and customs, our courts convict and sentence with very	little knowledge of the character or mentality of the man. Very little, if	anything, is known of the environment, opportunities, or underlying reasons for	the criminal tendencies of the man. I have seen men convicted of the same	crime, in the same state, by different courts, and sentenced to six months in	one case and two years in another. If there was any difference in the degree of	the offense, the man who got six months was the worse offender.<p>		<p>		<p>		One judge made a specialty of 'soaking them' for that particular crime, and the	other one had no particular feeling about it.<p>		<p>		<p>		One of those convicts might have been a deliberate and hardened criminal, and	the other might very easily have been an accidental offender, who would never	again become involved. The two are thrown into the common hopper, to serve as	many months or years as they might draw from the lottery.<p>		<p>		<p>		It would be difficult to devise a less scientific or more harmful method of	dealing with a vital human problem. Men commit crime from various motives, and	accidentally. All who do so immediately become dangerous to society, and upon	proof of guilt they should be rendered harmless by setting them apart, for the	protection of society. As soon as they are no longer dangerous they should be	returned to society. With crime always increasing, it is not sound reasoning to	discuss the deterrent effect of long sentences. They do not deter, to any great	extent. As stated above, sixty per cent of those who have served sentences go	back to serve other sentences.<p>		<p>		<p>		<font size=4><b>IV.</font></b><p>		<p>		I believe that men convicted of crime should be COMMITTED to a state	institution, just as the insane are committed to an asylum--to remain until	cured.<p>		<p>		<p>		The management of the state institution, charged with the custody and	safe-keeping of criminals, should be of such character as to enjoy the respect	and confidence of the community, and should be capable of developing and	testing the convict, and determining when he may be released without danger to	society. The entire responsibility for the length of time a man should remain	confined should rest with the management, and it should be held responsible for	the conduct of men after release. And, as stated above, the reputation and	success of the management should be made to have a direct relation to the	percentage of men released who become useful members of society.<p>		<p>		<p>		In order to protect against possible unfairness and incompetency on the part of	the management, any man, after serving one year, who believes that he is being	held longer than is proper, and who can convince any state court that there are	good grounds for such belief, should have access to a jury selected for the	purpose, before whom he can present his case and to whom the management must	give its reasons for detaining him. If the jury agree with the applicant, it	should have the power to release him, and by so doing become responsible for	his future behavior.<p>		<p>		<p>		The average pardon board is not fit to perform the functions assigned to it;	and my experience leads me to the belief that it is one of the worst and most	dangerous instrumentalities connected with our present penal system.<p>		<p>		<p>		With the matter of sentences arranged as outlined, I would then like to see all	sane convicts sent to a central receiving station for observation and	segregation.<p>		<p>		<p>		The authorities of such an institution should be qualified experts, capable of	prompt distribution of the men to one of the two following classes of	institutions:<p>		<p>		<p>		A.--Hospitals for detention of mental and physical defectives. This would take	about fifteen per cent of all convicts. As cured in the hospital, the men would	be transferred to the other class of institution.<p>		<p>		<p>		B.--Industrial institutions, equipped with a variety of industries capable of	producing goods and merchandise required by the country.<p>		<p>		<p>		Of those sent to the latter, about twenty per cent will turn out to be	hopeless, hardened, and deliberate criminals. Their presence in the place will	greatly increase the difficulties of developing good results. Their example and	influence will be bad on the other men, some of whom may be wavering between	weakness and strength of will-power.<p>		<p>		<p>		Additional restrictive and disciplinary measures will be necessary to guard	them, and it will be desirable in every way to segregate them, just as our	modern schools segregate the normally bright children from those who are dull	and slow to progress.<p>		<p>		<p>		I would, therefore, send the hopeless, hardened, and deliberate criminals to a	third sort of institution, in which they would be forced to earn their own	living, and from which there would not be the slightest possibility of escape,	except after unquestionable evidence that they had qualified for the B	institutions again. Not many of such fellows would qualify, but all should have	a chance, and be encouraged to try. If they never take advantage of that	opportunity they should remain in the third class for life, regardless of the	sort of crime of which they were convicted.<p>		<p>		<p>		The B institutions should be conducted along lines similar to those followed in	the Service Corps of the army. The men should be housed in dormitories, and	required to assemble for roll-call morning and night. The discipline should be	about the same as that controlling our military organizations. There should be	large farms, and a variety of other industries in which the men could be	employed to learn a trade or other useful occupation, of their own selection.	The employment should result in a profit to themselves and the institution.<p>		<p>		<p>		The population of the B institutions would be composed, in the great majority	of cases, of men who offered good prospects of development to the state where	they could be returned to society with safety and with beneficial results to	all concerned. A pickpocket might be kept there for twenty years, and a highway	robber might be released after two years; the time-limit would depend upon	their real progress toward a condition which would justify their release.<p>		<p>		<p>		All men would be encouraged to do the normal things that men usually do.	Opportunities to go wrong would be confronting them all the time, in	ever-increasing degree. After a time, they would be sent out to the farms; and	later on, they would be tried out where their duties brought them into contact	with the city and all its temptations. Illiterates would have to acquire an	education before release. All would be taught the duties and responsibilities	of citizenship.<p>		<p>		<p>		When there seemed no reasonable doubt as to the man's desire and capacity to go	it alone, he would be paroled for a period of a year or so, after a suitable	position had been secured for him. His conduct while on parole would be	followed, and every encouragement and assistance given him to overcome those	periods of mental depression which come to all men, and which are so often	responsible for crime.<p>		<p>		<p>		All institutions should and could be made entirely self-supporting; and not	only that, but the profits that may result from their operation should go	toward paying the entire criminal expense of the state, including criminal	courts, special officers, and so forth.<p>		<p>		<p>		It has been and will be said that the sale of convict-made products leads to	unfair competition with free labor and private industry. My answer to that is	that at Jackson we had every incentive to get all we could for our products,	and in no case did we under-price the products of private producers; but, in	some cases, we actually sold our goods on their merits, for higher prices than	those of some of the best merchandise in the country.<p>		<p>		<p>		So long as the institutions holding men in confinement are operated under a	plan of self-support, with a profit to employer and employee, there will be	little chance of unfair competition.<p>		<p>		<p>		Contract prison-labor is an abomination, and labor leaders and non-political	manufacturers have had just cause to complain of competition from such sources.	But I never found a situation where, when the facts were known, anyone	complained about competition of the products of the Jackson prison.<p>		<p>		<p>		Of course, we shall never bring our prison system into such a position as I	have outlined under a system of passing the jobs around as political rewards.	Neither shall we ever secure competent men to manage such institutions until	the pioneers in the effort prove to the public that the man in charge--and who	deserves to be in charge--is the mental and social equal of any university	president.<p>		<p>		<p>		Then, if we are to secure men competent to direct great business	enterprises,--and that is the only kind who can keep the average population of	a modern prison busy at useful and profitable work,--we must be willing to pay	the market price for such men.<p>		<p>		<p>		If we are to judge by the present distribution of ability and brains, man	to-day regards financial reward as the great objective, and a business career	as the route to that sort of success. But behind that material reward, the real	fellows will value far greater the self-satisfaction which comes from a	knowledge of having influenced in a helpful way the progress, contentment, and	happiness of others.<p>		<p>		<p>		I have permitted these observations to take the form of a description of what	has been done in one prison, because I believe that such method removes the	discussion from the realm of theory, and that thereby we may eliminate many	doubter and bring the consideration of the subject to the next stage.<p>		<p>		<p>		Such ideas as I have expressed as to what that next step should be are my own;	they have not been tried, but are they not worth a trial? We all know that the	old system is a failure.<p> </blockquote><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1922 by Brice P.

Under the beautiful shadow of the wild cherry trees and maple it has lain for years andis now overgrown with grapevines and honeysuckle, and has sheltered chipmunksand the itinerant skunks that wandered through on summer nights. In thecomparatively small space these logs and crumbling timber cover, an infinite,minute world goes on, almost soundless, often invisible, but continuous,shifting, full of faint scents and changing lights. By early autumn the grapeand honeysuckle are covered by the weightless sprawling vines of the wildcucumber, whose lace-like spires of flowers have changed to prickly clusters offruit, and whose twisting hands, delicate as watch springs, have grabbed on toevery perpendicular stalk they can wrap themselves about. Their mindless,loving spirals circle the Queen Anne's lace, and the handles of the brokenwheelbarrow carry their luminous green fruits, which dangle like spinyhedgehogs under the wide umbrella leaves.<p><p>The various bees of the world, from the great mumbling giants to the smallbrown velvet bees like winged moles, move over the cucumber vines which flowerand fruit at the same time. In the early morning these cucumber leaves arestiff and spread out in the dew like lily pads, but as the sun moves slowlyover the woodpile, they collapse weakly into soft mushy rags, and the path ofthe sun is marked by their fainting shapes. But no matter how closely I watchedI could not detect that mystic moment when the cluster of cucumber pods, silverand sticky as a bunch of burs became one cucumber. Was it chosen to grow of allthe lot, and the rest reluctantly drop away? Oh never mind us, it doesn'tmatter; we'll just wither up here in the grass while you grow big andstrong--or did one secretly devour the rest, spines and all, on some moonlitnight, and emerge. The One next morning? The world of animal and insect clicksalong with such business-like cruelty that the word actually has no meaning anymore in reference to anything but man, and the vegetables doubtless share thisglorious innocence, this immunity from the tribunal god. And there is nospiritual squealing on each other.<p><p>By the summer's end the woodpile is a mass of bindweed vines with their smallwhite flowers, of morning-glories whose delicate seed pods are shaped likewinged buds, and the enormous grape leaves are insect-riddled and some shadowyas lace. In the dark cool recesses under the logs grows the shelf fungus,velvety and soft like white kid gloves, and the swollen body of a brown earthcricket moves along the shelves, preoccupied and withdrawn in its pregnancy,waiting for the signal of its time. Sleek as a chestnut, but not at all ascheerful as a cricket, she steps sullenly around the small white cups of thebird's-nest fungus, some filled with the minute egg spores, waiting for a birdnot larger than a bee, and some empty and white as porcelain.<p><p>The English ivy that grows in a mat outward from the house and never climbs,seeming unable to attach itself to the painted brick, creeps each year nearerto the wild vines of the woodpile; and watching a wasp pick its elegant nervouspath along the sliding and the shining leaves one realizes suddenly the movingfloor that insects tread--the delicately articulated, shifting floor of leaves.The ivy bends and trembles under the wasp's foot, while we clump heavily overthe solid floor of earth.<p><p>While pondering on this I saw a small black spider asleep above a leaf, hishead bowed on his arms (or feet) like a sleeping cat, when suddenly the small,black, toady head jerked up and I looked directly into the creature's eyes.What an overwhelming experience! Those glittering darts of jet seemed theessence of unwinking evil. Refined and crystal evil of such purity that it heldyou frozen to the heart. For a long and horrid moment we stared at each other,and then it disappeared among the ivy leaves. As I thawed slowly back to normalit occurred to me that the encounter may have made some impression the otherway around. What did it think of me in that chilling moment. "My god!" was hesaying to his wife (or do these spiders have wives?--at least to some fellowarachnid), "those great, empty evil pools of green! Cold as autumn algae I sawmyself swimming in them! How shall I ever forget this?" And they would huddletogether like two black, hairy toads, thinking of what incredible situationsone encounters in this world.<p><p>2.<p><p>We had little or no vegetable garden this year. The small rich plot of groundthat our neighbor hopefully plows for us each year with his tractor starts outwith a beautiful rich and chocolate bareness, and stakes are set up to give aprofessional and tidy air. Then comes the selection of vegetables, which isremarkably limited since the children like only beans and carrots andcucumbers, and the rest of us are subject to strange wandering allergies whichrule out tomatoes and Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and cabbage. And potatoes,which our predecessors grew by the bushel, will yield for us nothing butstrange little plants like old Christmas trees stripped of needles and heavywith bright beetle balls. So we planted a few rows of beans and cucumbers and arow of corn.<p><p>Then up through the glistening chocolate soil all around these rows came thenative crop of cockle and wild amaranth, dock and sorrel, and thebindweed--which, given time, would over all the world, including the variousoceans, and the earth would hurtle through space, a globe of green clingingvines like a monstrous ivy ball. This is always a cause of considerable shameand sorrow to us through each summer, but this autumn, wandering through ourseedy jungle, I thought (with that stubborn core of brightness and sunshinewhich is innate in our incurably gloomy souls)--I thought, no, by heaven, thefruits of neglect are many and wonderful, and the harvest, although differentfrom other people's, has richness all its own! It is not that we would notprefer the golden and substantial harvest of the more industrious man, thecellar, freezer, flowing bin; but faced with the wages of sin, the devious soulinclines to polish up the tarnished coin and use it in those darker realmswhere it has a value all its own.<p><p>Well, this harvest of ours is a tide of morning-glory vines, whose leaves haveturned to a gold and dying brown, and some of a polished eggplant color, and inthe tide float blossoms of pure and delicate purple and magenta. Also there aregreen branches of the wormwood weed, delicate and lace-like, branched likecedar trees, with an indescribable aromatic autumn scent, like fir andamaranth, though an ugly and furry weed, has a long ancestry, both as a foodfor ancient people and as the center of religious rites. As Dr. Edgar Andersonpoints out in his book, Plants, Man and Life, the seeds are still used byprimitive people as grain and can be popped--and were by the Aztecs, who mixedthem with human blood, made images and ate them in a sort of communionceremony. They are also devils, and as I look about me in our garden I feel wemay have overdone this devil insurance a bit, and may be at the mercy of ourprotectors, as so often happens in this devious life.<p><p>In the meantime the children had decided this was the day to dig up the antlions and change them into a smaller home. They passed them about for us toinspect their louse-shaped bodies and scimitar-shaped horns, and held out thelions with one hand while they shook the seeds in the frying pan with the otherand talked about their "popping well." The bright black beads of amaranth didbegin popping soon, but though we tried too two batches, one delicately friedin oil, we could not keep them from scorching, and they tasted about asdelicious as burned sand. They may well require that added gastronomical touchof human blood, but the general feeling was to give the amaranth back to theAztecs where it came from.<p><p>In the tangle of the manifold weeds, the praying mantis (a valuable insect andmore effective against the devils them red amaranth, if you have something toprotect) comes each year and builds its spongy nest. One of the strangestsights is the laying of the mantis eggs. These are laid nest and all in onecurious, foamy operation, as though the mantis had become a green tube ofshaving cream, and out of her abdomen foams the gold froth which graduallyhardens in the air like a brittle sponge and clings to the vines or weed stemsthrough the winter, holding the eggs, from which will step briskly minutemantes in the spring.<p><p>I found one enormous female suspended among the buckwheat vines, her thinthorny arms in the ominous posture, not of prayer but of anticipation; and nearher a furry brown-gold caterpillar came crawling along the vines. It camenearer and nearer, and she watched with her pale terrible eyes its nibblingprogress around a leaf. Then the caterpillar came to the end of its leaf andreached out blindly to eat on, its jaws grazing the mantis on her leg. In thatmoment it became suddenly and terribly aware of the pinpoint eyes in their grayorbs watching above it, and retreated, humping, hurrying, actually ripplingwith horror, at the incredible nearness of its death.<p><p>The mantis was probably already satiated and about to bear her nest, becauselater when I brought her a new grasshopper, stump-winged still, with only graylumps where its wings should have been, and unable to do anything but crawl,she regarded it coldly, and did not stir, seeming to be preoccupied inwardlywith herself and the spongy delivery which was to come.<p><p>All around us the land is flat for a mile or so, gashed and white with thegravel quarries, and underlain with ancient limestone and acres of glacialstones. There are old and new quarries and some of the old have filled in tosmall lakes, blue and pure as only a quarry lake can be. And some of the gashesand holes have become small ponds and arroyos, with a willow-rooted,algae-blurred life of their own.<p><p>Toward the end of summer these willow ditches dry down to a mere leaf filleddampness, and along the final margin the algae cling to the hairy willow rootsand dry, white and web-like, like rows of fishermen's nets all up and down thelength of the vanished pool. In the fragrant shadow of the dying willows, inthe bed of ancient black willow leaves from other years, and small whitepebbles, there is a minute world of little, dry, dead things, fragile and ofmyriad shapes--tiny shells like rams' horns, pure white among the black leaves,and the hollow halves of microscopic burs, prickly and brown as porcupines. Thetransparent wing of a cicada is there and the white ghost of a dragonfly. Underthe curled cottonwood leaves whose dry cupped paws are not gray, not brown, butsepia, the color of old faded photographs, are the larger whorled shells of thesnails, abandoned to the winter, and once I found the delicate backbone of abird.<p><p>This small aromatic world of falling golden willow leaves and rounded stones isalmost uninhabited, except for the water thrush and the field sparrows. Thedragon flies have gone and the frogs are sleeping. I have sometimes imagined itpeopled with a small sturdy race of beings, not fairies, God forbid, but littlepersons two inches high with heads about the size and shape of the head of aclothespin, who live industrious pleasant lives, with only small stumpy wings,if any, to overcome the handicap of their size, who have no magic tricks orwands, and who do not indulge in that superior malice or sentimental wipingaway of bunny tears which is the fairies' stock in trade.<p><p>I have loathed fairies ever since the days of Tinker Bell and the mean slynessof the Alcott fairy who gave the bracelet that pricked. Loathed them at firstfurtively and guiltily, knowing them to be somehow the literary disguise ofadult authority, the power and the sermon sneaking in on silly rainbow wingswith thin legs and gauzy dresses, all-wise, all-powerful under its fragility,always beautiful (for the fat and forty love the image of themselves in goldenhair, barefooted on the flowers), insistent as mosquitoes, preaching at thehelpless human child. Well, these little people I have concocted for the willowditches are cheerful, work for their lives and not their souls, are ingeniousin the use of all that grows wild (they know what to do with amaranth seeds),make themselves quilts out of the milkweed down instead of floating around onit on their tiptoes, make themselves thatched cottages in the summer and burrowunder the roots of trees in winter, and are never found tapping innocent freshbabies on the dome with prickly wands.<p><p>This September ended with a long dry wind that seemed to have blown withoutstopping from some western desert. For several days it blew, full of dustscents and the dryness of sagebrush, carrying eastward our own autumn smells offalling maple leaves, green walnut, and the warm lemon odor of quince andyellow apple. With such level blowing all scents must have reached the oceanshores of the Atlantic and, unimpaired, mingled with foam and cooling sands,the smell of salt and fish and marshes. And though, at last, lost there in thesound and smell of breaking water, have sifted downward on the beaches, underthe same autumn moon that saw them starting eastward on their journey.<p>Copyright 1953, Josephine Johnson.<p>						<!--DROPCAP-->													<!--INSERT TEXT UP TO													HERE--></blockquote>												<!-- end article --><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br>			<!--NAVIGATION BUTTONS--><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

I was naturallyinterested in Edison because he was one of the greatest inventors of all time.I come from a family that is divided in its talents--one branch is artistic andone side is scientists, inventors, engineers. I was very fascinated when Iheard the Edison Papers Project was trying to understand the essence oftechnical creativity. I was interested in finding out more about the creativeimpetus in his case and what lessons everyone could derive from it and to whatdegree some of those qualities translate across media to other kinds ofcreative endeavors such as music and painting.<p><p><b>How did you get access to the people and the project?</b><p><p>I was on Rutgers campus doing another article. When I heard about the project Iended up spending about a week touring the beautiful facilities in West Orange.It was exquisite to see hand blown glass and a shop room floor with the oldmachinery that is stunning to view.<p><p><b>What surprised you about Edison?</b><p><p>I didn't realize how wildly enthusiastic Edison would be. I thought he was likethe rest of the public did, a stodgy, nose-to-the-grindstone kind of guy,burning the midnight oil--that is until he invented the light bulb. When youread his notebooks he's so excited by life. He has an incredible curiosity. Atthe least unexpected event, no matter how minor, he duly notes it down and getsso excited over stuff that turns out to be trivia. He had very few Eurekamoments, but if you read his notebooks you get the impression that there arelight bulbs going off in his head every ten seconds. He gets so excited byminutiae. If there's anything exciting or curious that happens while he doingsomething, he immediately stops and follows up on it. He also clearly had afun-loving streak and he clearly loved what he was doing and was going at itfull bore. He was having a marvelous time.<p><p><b>What do you like about science writing?</b><p><p>I think science is the most creative enterprise on earth. I get a tremendousbuzz out of the visual arts, but I don't find writing about them very exciting.Science is lends itself much more to writing, because it is so concept based.The other thing I love is trying to translate concepts that get buried intechnical jargon or in complex data that's difficult to interpret, I like topull out for people the underlying concepts to make them crystal clear so theycan get the same buzz that I do. Because I have a background in science I cansift through this all and get to the essence where for the average layman it'sa lot harder to do.<p><p><b>Why did you choose science writing over science?</b><p><p>I went through a soul-searching period where I decided I preferred sciencewriting to doing basic research because I enjoyed being more of generalist. Thejoke in science is: you learn more and more about less and less until you knoweverything about nothing at all. You really are very pigeon-holed in science,you really do lose sight of the big picture. I had just come out of universityand I had a very broad and excellent background in science and I wanted tobuild on that and I knew that if I became a scientist I was going to let mostof it go by the wayside except for the one specific area that I focus on.<p><p><b></b><p><b></b><p><i>Interview by Marty Hergert</i><p>	</blockquote><hr><pre></pre><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a><a href="../contents.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-toc.gif" width=72 height=23 border=0 alt="Contents"></a><a href="http://vws.agtnet.com/atl_find.html"><img src="../../../images/bt-find.gif" width=61 height=23 border=0 alt="Search"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; (1995) by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

<blockquote>
	
<B>How did you come to write a book on George Washington?</B><p>

<p>

It really goes back to college. When I was a freshman at Yale, in the spring of
1974, I took a course from Garry Wills. He was getting ready to do his big
Jefferson book, <i>Inventing America</i>. A lot of his lecture material ended
up in his book. He also brought Washington into it in a way that was very
compelling and attractive. Wills made me think about Washington. Then when I
was a senior I took another course from a fellow named Ronald Paulson, about
iconography in eighteenth-century art--Hogarth, Blake, James Gillray--and I wrote a
paper for him about Trumbull paintings on the Revolutionary War which hang in
the Yale art gallery. Looking at those paintings was a very visual way of
getting a sense of what Washington's contemporaries thought of him. They make
you think: What were they on to that we've forgotten or obscured over time?
Then the idea slumbered until 1989--the 200th anniversary of his
inauguration--when I wrote an essay for <i>Time.</i> I did the back page of
<i>Time</i>--about 900 words on Washington and what a great guy he was. That
was sort of the 900-word version of my book; the paper I did for Paulson was my
600-word version. Now I have the 63,000-word version. <p>

<p>

<B>If Washington were running for President today, do you think he would get
elected?</B><p>

<p>

Well, yes, of course. Colin Powell has these sky-high popularity ratings and he
didn't beat Iraq. George Washington, with a much dinkier country and a far
crummier army, did beat the British Empire. So if you're comparing the military
achievements of these two guys, it's almost embarrassing for General Powell.
People were also impressed by the fact that Washington stepped down--he
surrendered his commission at the end of the war as Congress directed that he
do. That impressed people all the more.<p>

<p>

<B>Can you make a comparison between Colin Powell and George Washington?</B><p>

<p>

There have been a number of generals who have gotten to be President and also
people who have had military service. They fall into two categories: the people
who have had no political experience--Taylor, Grant, Eisenhower, and Powell;
the people who have had political experience--Washington, Jackson, William
Henry Harrison, and Roosevelt. So there are the novices versus the non-novices,
and I think the big difference between Powell and Washington is that Powell has
no ideas, doesn't see why he should have any, and doesn't care about them. He
has no ideology. He's a smart man but he sees no need to have an ideology. Of
course Washington did see the need. That's one of the things we've forgotten about
Washington. He wasn't just a figurehead tugged about by Jefferson, Hamilton, or
Madison, or whoever could capture the rope, but he read these guys and
understood what they were saying and he chose among their works. Washington was
very much a player in the realm of ideas. Even if he was not himself a writer
or an original theorist. <p>

<p>

<B>You talk a lot about Washington's physical characteristics? Are there any
politicians in our time who carry themselves as well as Washington did?</B><p>

<p>

It is kind of an odd comparison but there is one: Nelson Mendela. You have to
remember that he's royalty. When you see him speaking, he carries himself a
certain way. He has a certain bearing and dignity. I think a lot of this is
background. He's a chief's son or a king's son. He was royalty--he was raised
that way and you can still tell that. Another example of a politician who
carries himself well is Boris Yeltsin. He demonstrated physical courage when he
clamored on top of that tank in '91. Yeltsin is a great disappointment. Like
Colin Powell he had no grasp of ideas and so he sort of let himself drift. He's
gone to hell basically. But at that moment of the coup he was the one who got
up on the tank when the army was circling around. There was sort of a physical
courage about the act that was very impressive.<p>

<p>

<B>Do you think Bob Dole's military heroism will figure in his campaign?</B><p>

<p>

I think it will. It will help him in pursuit of the nomination and if he wins
that it will help his pursuit of the Presidency too.<p>

<p>

<B>Why do you think military experience is still a factor in elections?</B><p>

<p>

It gives them a dimension of seriousness. Both the President and Senator Dole
have endorsed the intervention in Bosnia, but I think people will feel--if
there should be trouble--that Dole knew what he was getting into in a way that
Clinton never did. Dole's military exploits give him an edge. Obviously you
have to have something else. Bush had it too--he was shot down. People were
somewhat impressed with that and rightly so. George Bush did have his moments
but he also succumbed to drift and incoherence. You need other things, of
course, but military experience does help.<p>

<p>

<B>Do you think Bob Dole's injury from his military service is a constant sign to
people?</B><p>

<p>

In a very subtle way. He doesn't make anything of it. His whole strategy for
the last fifty years has been not to conceal it necessarily, but not to make it
evident. He's always holding a pen or a folder. He always holds something so
his arm is doing something. He carries it in such a way that he doesn't make a
thing of it.<p>

<p>

<B>What do you think we can learn from Washington's life that's applicable to the
present?</B><p>

<p>

After I finished the book, I thought of the four-word version--"He really meant
it." Everything that he advocated, everything that he talked about and did as a
public figure, he really meant. It's kind of sobering to realize how serious he
was about all this stuff. He did not sign the Declaration of Independence but
he certainly endorsed it. He had it read to his troops. He really believed in
the rights of man. He wasn't convinced that government according to those
rights would work, but he was going to give it a shot in America. There was a
real willingness to put his money where his mouth was and to put himself on the
line to really do it. That's very impressive. It's not like he had an opinion
on term limits or on the welfare state, or anything specific, but this attitude
of his is what most impresses me.<p>

<p>

<B>Do you think Washington could have handled the media of the present day?</B><p>

<p>

The drastic change is the all-pervasiveness of the media. The frequency and
insatiability of it. It's after you 24-hours-a-day, which wasn't the case in
his day. However, the press was every bit as aggressive and probably worse.
American journalism has gotten far more polite and scrupulous, honest, and
ethical. It was terrible two hundred years ago. Journalists just made stuff up.
They lied. They were scoundrels. The worst of talk radio is far better than
these characters were. So Washington certainly wouldn't be surprised by
modern-day vilification.<p>

<font size=5><img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="T"></font>HE question in my title implies a premise: that 
historically the United States
has well afforded to be a nation of immigrants -- indeed, has benefited
handsomely from its good fortune as an immigrant destination. That proposition
was once so deeply embedded in our national mythology as to be axiomatic. More
than a century ago, for example, in the proclamation that made Thanksgiving Day
a national holiday, Abraham Lincoln gave thanks to God for having "largely
augmented our free population by emancipation and by immigration."<p>

Lincoln spoke those words when there were but 34 million Americans and half 
a continent remained to be settled.  Today, however, the United States is a 
nation of some 264 million souls on a continent developed beyond Lincoln's 
imagination.  It is also a nation experiencing immigration on a scale never 
before seen.  In the past three decades, since the passage of <A 
HREF="http://www.fairus.org/history/03101603.htm">the Immigration and 
Nationality Act Amendments of 1965</A>, the first major revision in 
American immigration statutes since the historic closure of immigration in 
the 1920s, some 20 million immigrants have entered the United States.  To 
put those numbers in perspective: prior to 1965 the period of heaviest 
immigration to the United States was the quarter century preceding the 
First World War, when some 17 million people entered the country -- roughly 
half the total number of Europeans who migrated to the United States in the 
century after 1820 (along with several hundred thousand Asians).  The last 
pre-war census, in 1910, counted about 13.5 million foreign-born people in 
the American population, in contrast to about 22.5 million in 1994.  
Historians know a great deal about those earlier immigrants -- why they 
came, how they ended up, what their impact was on the America of their day.  
Whether America's historical experience with immigration provides a useful 
guide to thinking about the present case is the principal question I want 
to address.  I want not only to explore the substantive issue of 
immigration but also to test the proposition that the discipline of history 
has some value as a way of knowing and thinking about the world.<p>

With respect to immigration itself, I intend to explore two sets of questions.
<p>

<ul>

<li> Why did people migrate to America in the past, and what were the
consequences, for them and for American society, once they landed? <p>

<li> Why are people migrating to America today, and what might be the
consequences, for them and for American society, of their presence in such
numbers?<p><br>

</ul>

<H3>
<center>The Pull of America
</center>

</H3>
<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/A-small.gif" align=left height=44 
alt="A"></font> generation or two ago upbeat answers to the first pair of 
questions so pervaded the culture that they cropped up in the most exotic 
places -- in Tunisia, for example, on July 9, 1943.  The occasion was the 
eve of the invasion of Sicily, and General George S. Patton 
Jr.  was addressing his troops, who were about to embark for the battle.  
He urged, "When we land, we will meet German and Italian soldiers whom it 
is our honor and privilege to attack and destroy.  Many of you have in your 
veins German and Italian blood, but remember that these ancestors of yours 
so loved freedom that they gave up home and country to cross the ocean in 
search of liberty.  The ancestors of the people we shall kill lacked the 
courage to make such a sacrifice and continued as slaves."<p>

In his own inimitable idiom Patton was invoking what for most Americans
was -- and still is -- the standard explanation of who their immigrant forebears
were, why they left their old countries, and what was their effect on American
society. In this explanation immigrants were the main-chance-seeking and most
energetic, entrepreneurial, and freedom-loving members of their Old World
societies. They were drawn out of Europe by the irresistible magnet of American
opportunity and liberty, and their galvanizing influence on American society
made this country the greatest in the world.<p>

A radically different explanation of immigration has also historically been at
work in the American mind. As the noted social scientist Edward Alsworth Ross
put it in 1914:<p>

<blockquote>
Observe immigrants not as they come travel-wan up the gang-plank, nor as they
issue toil-begrimed from pit's mouth or mill-gate, but in their gatherings,
washed, combed, and in their Sunday best. . . . [They] are hirsute, low-browed,
big-faced persons of obviously low mentality. . . . They simply look out of
place in black clothes and stiff collar, since clearly they belong in skins, in
wattled huts at the close of the Great Ice Age. These ox-like men are
descendants of those who always stayed behind.<p>
</blockquote>


Ross was describing in these invidious terms what he and his
turn-of-the-century contemporaries called the "new" immigrants -- new because
they came predominantly from eastern and southern Europe, as distinct from the
"old," early-and-mid-nineteenth-century immigrants, who had come mainly from
northern and western Europe. Ironically, Ross was also talking about the
parents of those very troops (at least the Italian-American troops) whom Patton
addressed in 1943.<p>

Between those two poles of explanation American views of immigration have 
oscillated.  On the one hand, as Patton reminds us, immigrants were judged 
to be noble souls, tugged by the lodestone of American opportunity, whose 
talents and genius and love of liberty account for the magnificent American 
character.  On the other hand, as in Ross's view, especially if they had 
the misfortune to arrive on a more recent boat, immigrants were thought to 
be degraded, freeloading louts, a blight on the national character and a 
drain on the economy -- the kind of people described all too literally, so 
the argument goes, by Emma Lazarus's <A 
HREF="http://www.myhero.com/poets/index.htm"> famous inscription </A> on 
the base of the Statue 
of Liberty: "your tired, your poor .  .  .  the wretched refuse of your 
teeming shore."<p>

Yet for all their differences, the two views have several things in common.
Both explain immigration in terms of the moral character of immigrants. Both
understand immigration as a matter of individual choice. And both implicitly
invoke the American magnet as the irresistible force that put people in motion,
drawing them either to opportunity or to dependency.<p>

Those concepts do not bear close analysis as adequate explanations for the
movement of some 35 million human beings over the course of a century. This was
a historical phenomenon too huge and too specific in time to be sufficiently
accounted for by summing 35 million decisions supposedly stimulated by the
suddenly irresistible gravitational attraction of a far-off 
continent.<p><br>

<H3>
<center>The Push of Europe</center>
</H3>

<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/F-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="F"></font>OR the first three centuries or so after the European discovery of the New
World the principal source of immigrants to the two American continents and the
Caribbean was not Europe but Africa. Only in the early nineteenth century did
the accumulated total of European settlers in the New World exceed the
approximately 10 million Africans who had made the trans-Atlantic voyage in the
years since 1492. To explain the African diaspora by citing entrepreneurial
instincts, the love of democracy, or the freely chosen decisions of migrants to
follow the lodestar of American promise would be a mockery. Clearly, the
involuntary movement of those 10 million Africans is best explained not in
terms of their individual characters and choices but in terms of the
catastrophically disruptive expansion of large-scale plantation agriculture and
its accursed corollary, large-scale commercial slavery.<p>

A comparable -- though, to be sure, not identical -- element of involuntariness
characterized emigration from nineteenth-century Europe. Any generalization
about what prompted a phenomenon as long-lived and complicated as the great
European migration must, of course, be subject to many qualifications. All
discussions of the migration process recognize both push and pull factors. But
at bottom the evidence convincingly supports the argument that disruption is
essential to the movement of people on such a scale. And, as in the African
case, the best, most comprehensive explanation for a process that eventually
put some 35 million people in motion is to be found in two convulsively
disruptive developments that lay far beyond the control of individual
Europeans. Those developments had their historical dynamic within the context
of European, not American, history.<p>

The first of these needs little elaboration. It was, quite simply, population
growth. In the nineteenth century the population of Europe more than doubled,
from some 200 million to more than 400 million, even after about 70 million
people had left Europe altogether. (Only half of these, it should be noted,
went to the United States -- one among many clues that the American-magnet
explanation is inadequate.) That population boom was the indispensable
precondition for Europe to export people on the scale that it did. And the boom
owed little to American stimulus; rather, it was a product of aspects of
European historical evolution, especially improvements in diet, sanitation, and
disease control.<p>

The second development was more complex, but we know it by a familiar name: the
Industrial Revolution.
It includes the closely associated revolution in
agricultural productivity. Wherever it occurred, the Industrial Revolution
shook people loose from traditional ways of life. It made factory workers out
of artisans and, even more dramatically, turned millions of rural farmers into
urban wage-laborers. Most of those migrants from countryside to city, from
agriculture to industry, remained within their country of origin, or at least
within Europe. But in the early stages of industrialization the movement of
people, like the investment of capital during the unbridled early days of
industrialism, was often more than what the market could bear. In time most
European societies reached a kind of equilibrium, absorbing their own workers
into their own wage markets. But in the typical transitional phase some workers
who had left artisanal or agricultural employments could not be reabsorbed
domestically in European cities. They thus migrated overseas.<p>

The large scholarly literature documenting this process might be summarized as
follows: Imagine a map of Europe. Across this map a time line traces the
evolution of the Industrial Revolution. From a point in the British Isles in
the late eighteenth century the line crosses to the Low Countries and Germany
in the early and mid nineteenth century and to eastern and southern Europe in
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Across the same map a second
line traces the chronological evolution of migration to the United States. As
it happens, the two lines are almost precisely congruent -- migration came
principally from the British Isles in the eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries, then mainly from Germany, and finally from the great watersheds of
the Vistula and the Danube and the mountain ranges of the Apennines and
Carpathians to the south and east.<p>

The congruence of those lines is not coincidental. Industrialization, in this
view, is <i>the</i> root cause and the most powerful single variable explaining the
timing, the scale, the geographic evolution, and the composition of the great
European migration.<p>

For another perspective on the importance of understanding the European
migration from a European point of view, consider the lyrics of a
nineteenth-century Italian folk song called "The Wives of the Americans." In
this case, the "Americans" were men who had gone off to America and left their
wives behind in Italy -- specifically, the southern region of Campania. In fact,
men, young men in particular, predominated in the nineteenth-century migratory
stream, and their predominance constitutes a reliable indicator of their
purposes. Many of them never intended to settle permanently elsewhere but hoped
to work abroad for a time and eventually return to the old country.
Repatriation rates for European immigrants averaged nearly 40 percent. Only the
Jews and the Irish did not go home again in significant numbers. For some
later, "new" immigrant groups, especially from the southern Danube regions,
repatriation rates ran as high as 80 percent.<p>

The song describes the wives of the Americans going to church and praying,
"Send money, my husband. Send more money. The money you sent earlier I have
already spent. I spent it on my lover. I spent it with pleasure. Send more
money, you <i>cornuto fottuto</i> [damnable cuckold]." Those lyrics conjure an image
of immigration quite different from the one General Patton urged on his
Italian-American troops in 1943. Together with the figures on repatriation,
they offer a strong corrective to uncritical reliance on the American-magnet
explanation for the past century's European migration.<p><br>

<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/W-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="W"></font>HAT happened to European immigrants, and to American society, once they
arrived? Much historical inquiry on this point focuses on immigrant hardship
and on recurrent episodes of nativism, anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, and
anti-foreign-radicalism, from the <a 
href="http://www.nps.gov/wamo/knownoth.htm">Know-Nothing movement</a> of the 1850s to the
American Protective Association of the late nineteenth century and the revived

Ku Klux Klan of the early twentieth century, culminating in the highly
restrictive immigration legislation of the 1920s. Those are important elements
in the history of American immigration, and we would forget them at our peril.
But getting the question right is the most challenging part of any historical
investigation, and there is an analytically richer question to be asked than
Why did immigrants meet sometimes nasty difficulties?<p>

An even more intriguing question is How did tens of millions of newcomers
manage to accommodate themselves to America, and America to them, without more
social disruption? How can we explain this society's relative success -- and
success I believe it was -- in making space so rapidly for so many people?<p>

The explanation is surely not wise social policy. Beyond minimal monitoring at
the ports of entry, no public policy addressed the condition of immigrants once
they were cleared off Castle 
Garden or <a href="http://www.us.net/upa/guides/insa3.htm">Ellis Island</a>. But three specific
historical circumstances, taken together, go a long way toward composing an
answer to the question.<p>

First, somewhat surprisingly, for all their numbers, immigrants -- even the 17
million who arrived from 1890 to 1914 -- never made up a very large component of
the already enormous society that was turn-of-the-century America. The census
of 1910 records the highest percentage of foreign-born people ever resident in
the United States: 14.7 percent. Now, 14.7 percent is not a trivial proportion,
but it is a decided minority, and relative to other societies that have
received large numbers of immigrants, a small minority. The comparable figures
in Australia and Canada at approximately the same time were 17 percent and more
than 20 percent, and even higher in Argentina. So here is one circumstance
accounting for the relative lack of social conflict surrounding immigration a
century ago: at any given moment immigrants were a relatively small presence in
the larger society.<p>

A second circumstance was economic. Immigrants supplied the labor that a
growing economy urgently demanded. What is more, economic growth allowed the
accommodation of newcomers without forcing thorny questions of
redistribution -- always the occasion for social contest and upheaval. Here, as
so often in American history, especially during the period of heavy immigration
before the First World War, economic growth worked as a pre-emptive solution to
potential social conflict.<p>

The third circumstance was more complicated than sheer numbers or economic
growth. I call this circumstance "pluralism" -- by which I mean simply that the
European immigrant stream was remarkably variegated in its cultural, religious,
national, and linguistic origins. These many subcurrents also distributed
themselves over an enormous geographic region -- virtually the entire
northeastern quadrant of the United States -- and through several political
jurisdictions. By the 1920s immigrants were distributed widely across the great
industrial belt that stretched from New England through New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, and beyond: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and
Minnesota. The states with the most immigrants, not incidentally, also had per
capita incomes higher than the national average -- an important fact pertinent to
understanding the relationship between immigration and economic vitality.<p>

The varied composition and broad dispersal of the immigrant stream carried
certain crucial implications, one being that no immigrant group could
realistically aspire to preserve its Old World culture intact for more than a
few generations at best. To be sure, many groups made strenuous efforts to do
just that. Legend to the contrary, last century's immigrants did not cast their
Old World habits and languages overboard before their ship steamed into New
York Harbor. In fact, many groups heroically exerted themselves to sustain
their religions, tongues, and ways of life. The Catholic school system, which
for a generation or two in some American cities educated nearly as many
students as the public school system, eloquently testified to the commitment of
some immigrant communities to resist assimilation. But circumstances weighed
heavily against the success of such efforts. The virtual extinction of the
parochial school system in the past generation -- the empty schools and
dilapidated parish buildings that litter the inner cores of the old immigrant
cities -- bears mute witness both to the ambition and to the ultimate failure of
those efforts to maintain cultural distinctiveness.<p>

A second and no less important implication of pluralism was that neither any
single immigrant group nor immigrants as a whole could realistically mount any
kind of effective challenge to the existing society's way of doing things. No
single group had sufficient weight in any jurisdiction larger than a
municipality to dictate a new political order. And there was little likelihood
that Polish Jews and Italian Catholics and Orthodox Greeks could find a common
language, much less common ground for political action.<p>

To recapitulate: The most comprehensive explanation of the causes of
immigration a century ago is to be found in the disruptions visited on European
society by population growth and the Industrial Revolution. The United States
was, to use the language of the law, the incidental beneficiary of that
upheaval. The swelling immigrant neighborhoods in turn-of-the-century American
cities were, in effect, by-products of the urbanization of Europe. And once
landed in America, immigrants accommodated themselves to the larger
society -- not always easily assimilating, but at least working out a modus
vivendi -- without the kinds of conflicts that have afflicted other multinational
societies. That mostly peaceful process of accommodation came about because of
the relatively small numbers of immigrants at any given time, because of the
health of the economy, and because of the constraints on alternatives to
accommodation inherent in the plural and dispersed character of the immigrant
stream. <p>

Having lit this little lamp of historical learning, I would like to carry it
forward and see if it can illuminate the present.<p><br>

<H3>
<center>Today's Immigration</center>
</H3>

<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="T"></font>HE biggest apparent novelty in current immigration is its source, or sources.
Well over half of the immigration of the past thirty years has come from just
seven countries: Mexico, the Philippines, China (I am including Taiwan),
Vietnam, Korea, India, and the Dominican Republic. <p>

Not a single European country is on that list. Here, it would seem, is
something new under the historical sun. Europe has dried up as a source of
immigration and been replaced by new sources in Latin America and Asia.<p>

And yet if we remember what caused the great European migration, the novelty of
the current immigration stream is significantly diminished. Though particular
circumstances vary, most of the countries now sending large numbers of
immigrants to the United States are undergoing the same convulsive demographic
and economic disruptions that made migrants out of so many nineteenth-century
Europeans: population growth and the relatively early stages of their own
industrial revolutions.<p>

Mexico, by far the leading supplier of immigrants to the United States,
conforms precisely to that pattern. Since the Second World War the Mexican
population has more than tripled -- a rate of growth that recollects, indeed
exceeds, that of nineteenth-century Europe. And as in Europe a century ago,
population explosion has touched off heavy internal migration, from rural to
urban areas. By some reckonings, Mexico City has become the largest city in the
world, with 20 million inhabitants and an in-migration from the Mexican
countryside estimated at 1,000 people a day.<p>

Also since the Second World War the Mexican economy, despite periodic problems,
has grown at double the average rate of the U.S. economy. Rapid
industrialization has been accompanied by the swift and widespread
commercialization of Mexican agriculture. A Mexican "green revolution," flowing
from improvements in mechanical processing, fertilizers, and insecticides, has
in fact exacerbated the usual disruptions attendant on rapid industrialization:
depopulation of the countryside, urban in-migration, and movement across the
national border. But as in nineteenth-century Europe, most of the movement has
been within Mexico itself. Since 1970 some five million Mexicans have entered
the United States to stay; probably more than 10 million have moved to Mexico
City alone. <p>

Thus we are in the presence of a familiar historical phenomenon, impelled by
developments that are for all practical purposes identical to those that
ignited the great European migration of a century ago.<p><br>

<H3>
<center>What Does the Future Hold?</center>
</H3>
<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/I-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="I"></font>F the causes of present-day immigration are familiar, what will be the
consequences for today's immigrants and tomorrow's America?<p>

I have suggested that three historical circumstances eased the accommodation
between immigrants and the American society of a century ago -- the relatively
small number of immigrants present at any given time, the needs and vitality of
the economy, and the plural and distributed character of the immigrant stream.
How do those factors weigh in an analysis of immigration today?<p>

With respect to numbers, the historical comparison gives a basis for confidence
that the answer to our original question -- Can we still afford to be a nation of
immigrants? -- is yes. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that as of 1994
foreign-born people represented 8.7 percent of the American population, or just
a bit more than half the proportion they made up in the census of 1910.
(Comparable recent numbers for Canada and Australia, incidentally, are
approximately 16 percent and 22 percent.) So, with reference to both American
historical experience and contemporary experience in other countries, the
<i>relative</i> incidence of current immigration to the United States is rather
modest. Surely the United States at the end of the twentieth century is
resourceful enough to deal with an immigrant inflow proportionally half what
American society managed to deal with quite successfully in the early years of
this century.<p>

With reference to the needs and vitality of the economy, the historical
comparison is more complicated. Economic theory suggests that immigration is a
bargain for any receiving society, because it augments the labor supply, one of
the three principal factors of production (along with land and capital),
essentially free of cost. The sending society bears the burden of feeding and
raising a worker to the age when he or she can enter the labor market. If at
that point the person emigrates and finds productive employment elsewhere, the
source society has in effect subsidized the economy of the host society. That
scenario essentially describes the historical American case, in which fresh
supplies of immigrant labor underwrote the nation's phenomenal industrial surge
in the half century after the Civil War.<p>

The theory is subject to many qualifications. Unskilled immigrant workers may
indeed increase gross economic output, as they did from the Pittsburgh blast
furnaces to the Chicago packinghouses a century ago, and as they do today in
garment shops and electronic assembly plants from Los Angeles to Houston. But
as productivity has become more dependent on knowledge and skill, the net value
of unskilled immigrant labor has decreased, a point that informs much of the
current case for restricting immigration. Yet it is important to note that
argument on this point turns on the <i>relative</i> contribution of low-skill workers
to overall output; the theory is still unimpeachable in its insistence on the
<i>absolute</i> value of an additional worker, from whatever source, immigrant or
native. Nevertheless, large numbers of unskilled immigrants may in the long run
retard still higher potential outputs, because the inexpensive labor supply
that they provide diminishes incentives to substitute capital and improved
technology for labor, and thus inhibits productivity gains. On the other hand,
just to complicate the calculation further, insofar as the host society
continues to need a certain amount of low-skill work done, the availability of
unskilled immigrants may <i>increase</i> the economy's overall efficiency by freeing
significant numbers of better-educated native workers to pursue
higher-productivity employment. And overhanging all this part of the
immigration debate is the question of whose ox is gored. Low-skill immigrants
may benefit the economy as a whole, but may at the same time impose substantial
hardships on the low-skill native workers with whom they are in direct
competition for jobs and wages.<p>

Of course, the theory that immigration subsidizes the host economy is true only
insofar as the immigrant in question is indeed a worker, a positive contributor
to the productive apparatus of the destination society. Even the crude American
immigration-control system of the nineteenth century recognized that fact, when
it barred people likely to become social dependents, such as the chronically
ill or known criminals. The issue of dependency is particularly vexatious in
the United States today for two reasons. First, the 1965 legislation contained
generous clauses providing for <a 
href="http://www.wave.net/upg/immigration/family_reunification.html">"family 
reunification,"</a> under the terms of which
a significant portion of current immigrants are admitted not as workers but as
the spouses, children, parents, and siblings of citizens or legally resident
aliens. In 1993, a typical year, fewer than 20 percent of immigrants entered
under "employment-based" criteria.<p>

Because of family-reunification provisions, the current immigrant population
differs from previous immigrant groups in at least two ways: it is no longer
predominantly male and, even more strikingly, it is older. The percentage of
immigrants over sixty-five exceeds the percentage of natives in that age group,
and immigrants over sixty-five are two and a half times as likely as natives to
be dependent on Supplemental 
Security Income, the principal federal program
making cash payments to the indigent elderly. Newspaper accounts suggest that
some families have brought their relatives here under the family-reunification
provisions in the law expressly for the purpose of gaining access to SSI. Thus
it appears that the availability of welfare programs -- programs that did not
exist a century ago -- has combined with the family-reunification provisions to
create new incentives for immigration that complicate comparisons of the
economics of immigration today with that in the nineteenth century.<p>

But on balance, though today's low-skill immigrants may not contribute as
weightily to the economy as did their European counterparts a hundred years
ago, and though some do indeed end up dependent on public assistance, as a
group they make a positive economic contribution nevertheless. It is no
accident that today's immigrants are concentrated in the richest states, among
them California (home to fully one third of the country's immigrant
population), just as those of the 1920s were. And just as in that earlier era,
immigrants are not parasitic on the "native" economy but productive
participants in it. The principal motivation for immigration remains what it
was in the past: the search for productive employment. Most immigrants come in
search of work, and most find it. Among working-age males, immigrant
labor-force-participation rates and unemployment rates are statistically
indistinguishable from those for native workers. The ancient wisdom still
holds: <i>Ubi est pane, ibi est patria</i> ("Where there is bread, there is my
country"). Not simply geography but also that powerful economic logic explains
why Mexico is the principal contributor of immigrants to the United States
today: the income gap between the United States and Mexico is the largest
between any two contiguous countries in the world.<p>

One study, by the Stanford economist Clark W. Reynolds, estimated the future
labor-market characteristics and prospects for economic growth in Mexico and
the United States. For Mexico to absorb all the new potential entrants into its
own labor markets, Reynolds concluded, its economy would have to grow at the
improbably high rate of some seven percent a year. The United States, in
contrast, if its economy is to grow at a rate of three percent a year, must
find somewhere between five million and 15 million more workers than can be
supplied by domestic sources. Reynolds's conclusion was obvious: Mexico and the
United States need each other, the one to ease pressure on its employment
markets, the other to find sufficient labor to sustain acceptable levels of
economic growth. If Reynolds is right, the question with which I began -- Can we
still afford to be a nation of immigrants? -- may be wrongly put. The proper
question may be Can we afford <i>not</i> to be? (For another perspective on this
question see this month's article by <a 
href="./borjas.htm">George J. Borjas</a>.)<p><br>

<H3>
<center>The Reconquista</center>
</H3>
<p>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/B-small.gif" align=left 
height=44 alt="B"></font>UT if economic necessity requires that the United States be a nation of
immigrants into the indefinite future, as it has been for so much of its past,
some important questions remain. Neither men nor societies live by bread alone,
and present-day immigration raises historically unprecedented issues in the
cultural and political realms.<p>

Pluralism -- the variety and dispersal of the immigrant stream -- made it easier
for millions of European immigrants to accommodate themselves to American
society. Today, however, one large immigrant stream is flowing into a defined
region from a single cultural, linguistic, religious, and national source:
Mexico. <a href="http://www.upapubs.com/guides/insa2.htm#intro">Mexican 
immigration</a> is concentrated heavily in the Southwest,
particularly in the two largest and most economically and politically
influential states -- California and Texas. Hispanics, including Central and
South Americans but predominantly Mexicans, today compose 28 percent of the
population of Texas and about 31 percent of the population of California. More
than a million Texans and more than three million Californians were born in
Mexico. California alone holds nearly half of the Hispanic population, and well
over half of the Mexican-origin population, of the entire country.<p>

This Hispanicization of the American Southwest is sometimes called the
Reconquista, a poetic reminder that the territory in question was, after all,
incorporated into the United States in the first place by force of arms, in the
Mexican War of the 1840s. There is a certain charm in this turn of the wheel of
history, with its reminder that in the long term the drama of armed conquest
may be less consequential than the prosaic effects of human migration and birth
rates and wage differentials. But the sobering fact is that the United States
has had no experience comparable to what is now taking shape in the
Southwest.<p>

Mexican-Americans will have open to them possibilities closed to previous
immigrant groups. They will have sufficient coherence and critical mass in a
defined region so that, if they choose, they can preserve their distinctive
culture indefinitely. They could also eventually undertake to do what no
previous immigrant group could have dreamed of doing: challenge the existing
cultural, political, legal, commercial, and educational systems to change
fundamentally not only the language but also the very institutions in which
they do business. They could even precipitate a debate over a "special
relationship" with Mexico that would make the controversy over the North
American Free Trade Agreement look like a college bull session. In the process,
Americans could be pitched into a soul-searching redefinition of fundamental
ideas such as the meaning of citizenship and national identity.<p>

All prognostications about these possibilities are complicated by another
circumstance that has no precedent in American immigration history: the region
of Mexican immigrant settlement in the southwestern United States is contiguous
with Mexico itself. That proximity may continuously replenish the immigrant
community, sustaining its distinctiveness and encouraging its assertiveness.
Alternatively, the nearness of Mexico may weaken the community's coherence and
limit its political and cultural clout by chronically attenuating its members'
permanence in the United States, as the accessibility of the mother country
makes for a kind of perpetual repatriation process. <p>

In any case, there is no precedent in American history for these possibilities.
No previous immigrant group had the size and concentration and easy access to
its original culture that the Mexican immigrant group in the Southwest has
today. If we seek historical guidance, the closest example we have to hand is
in the diagonally opposite corner of the North American continent, in Quebec.
The possibility looms that in the next generation or so we will see a kind of
Chicano Quebec take shape in the American Southwest, as a group emerges with
strong cultural cohesiveness and sufficient economic and political strength to
insist on changes in the overall society's ways of organizing itself and
conducting its affairs.<p>

Public debate over immigration has already registered this prospect, however
faintly. How else to explain the drive in Congress, and in several states, to
make English the "official" language for conducting civil business? In previous
eras no such legislative muscle was thought necessary to expedite the process
of immigrant acculturation, because alternatives to eventual acculturation were
simply unimaginable. Less certain now that the traditional incentives are
likely to do the work of assimilation, we seem bent on trying a <i>ukase</i> -- a
ham-handed and provocative device that may prove to be the opening chapter of a
script for prolonged cultural warfare. Surely our goal should be to help our
newest immigrants, those from Mexico especially, to become as well integrated
in the larger American society as were those European "new" immigrants whom E.
A. Ross scorned but whose children's patriotism George Patton could take for
granted. To reach that goal we will have to be not only more clever than our
ancestors were but also less confrontational, more generous, and more welcoming
than our current anxieties sometimes incline us to be.<p>

The present may echo the past, but will not replicate it. Yet the fact that
events have moved us into <i>terra nova et incognita</i> does not mean that history is
useless as a way of coming to grips with our situation. To the contrary, the
only way we can know with certainty as we move along time's path that we have
come to a genuinely new place is to know something of where we have been.
"What's new in the starry sky, dear Argelander?" Kaiser Wilhelm I is said to
have asked his state astronomer, to which Argelander replied, "And does Your
Majesty already know the old?" Knowing the old is the project of historical
scholarship, and only that knowledge can reliably point us toward the new. As
Lincoln also said, "As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We
must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country."<p>

	<font size=5>I</font>n "America's Search for a New Public Philosophy" (March <i>Atlantic</i>),

Michael J. Sandel makes the argument that Democrats and Republicans both have

"an impoverished vision of citizenship" and that the country cannot articulate

a public philosophy that deals with civic virtue. Sandel is right in his

assessment of the "national 'funk,'" and he points out that both conservatives

and liberals subscribe to a Rawlsian version of neutral liberalism which is at

the root of the problem. But Sandel overlooks contemporary alternatives that

are being generated at the grassroots level--for example, the New Party--to

counter the "threat to self-government" that both big business and the federal

government pose to the republic.<p>



The New Party, which includes the likes of Noam Chomsky and Cornel West, has

won several local elections in Milwaukee, Chicago, and even Missoula, Montana,

and has worked with unions and community organizations in St. Paul and

Milwaukee to pass "living-wage" legislation to increase the minimum wage paid

to employees of firms that receive public money. Truly the heir of the old

Progressive movement, the party supports full employment, democratization of

the banking system, fair (rather than free) trade agreements, and a reduction

in military spending, among other things. The New Party is a localized

phenomenon of regular people doing their civic duty--on a small scale. Its

philosophy is one of civic involvement rather than the special-interest,

individualistic philosophy of the Democrats.<p>

	<font size=5>M</font>ichael J. Sandel did a good job of explaining how political philosophy

in the United States has evolved over time in response to economic and

technological change. He also presents an interesting way of classifying the

political arguments that resonate throughout our national history by

introducing the concepts of civic republicanism and liberal freedom. Sandel is

balanced in his portrayal of the virtues and vices inherent in each system. In

the end, though, he favors civic republicanism, at least at the local level, as

being the bedrock on which the survival of democracy ultimately depends. I

would agree.<p>



But Sandel does not correctly identify the most potent group interested in

restoring civic republicanism to the United States today. In fact, he goes so

far as to single these people out for slanderous depictions uncharacteristic of

his otherwise reasonable article. I am referring to the Christian

conservatives, whom Sandel chooses to condemn as "undesirable" and

"intolerant." The agenda of these groups--for example, to outlaw abortion,

reintroduce prayer in public schools, and return homosexuality to the

closet--is really nothing more than an attempt to restore standard American

civic culture. As recently as 1960 all these civic norms were the

uncontroversial law of the land and enjoyed wide support from citizens of all

ethnic and religious backgrounds along with politicians across the spectrum. If

this is not civic republicanism, what is?<p>

	<br><br><br>

	

	<font size=5>M</font>ichael J. Sandel has brilliantly diagnosed the problem, but his

remedy--even bigger global government--flies in the face of reason. If big

government and big business are the problem, bigger international government

would only add to it.<p>



Sandel writes that Thomas Jefferson worried, with good cause, that "large-scale

manufacturing would create a propertyless class, lacking the independence that

republican citizenship requires." Louis D. Brandeis's remedy of bigger

government to control bigger corporations did nothing to address Jefferson's

concerns. Instead it ratcheted up the race to greater bigness by both.

Brandeis's and Sandel's remedies would leave the individual feeling smaller and

less empowered.<p>



Aristotle was correct in asserting that, in Sandel's words, "self-government

[is] an activity rooted in a particular place, carried out by citizens loyal to

that place and the way of life it embodies." The challenge of our times is to

apply Aristotle's principle to contemporary society.<p>

	<font size=5>"A</font>merica's Search for a New Public Philosophy" is, in my opinion, a

shot straight to the heart of the problem. I would presume to add just one

thought about the principle involved. The members of a complex modern society

are simply not free to "choose their own values and ends." Their presence

within that society implies a commitment to surrender to the "values and ends"

of the majority of their fellow citizens.<p>



The concept of a "New Federalism" was launched by Richard Nixon, not Ronald

Reagan. I can speak with some assurance on this, because I was on the Office of

Management and Budget team that prepared a report for the President, delivered

(fatefully) in May of 1974. The term was rumored to have been suggested to

President Nixon by William Safire, then a White House speechwriter. What

distinguished the Nixon-Roy Ash version from those that followed was the idea

of devolving taxing authority to the states along with responsibility for

decentralized program management. The Reagan staff transformed this

theoretically workable plan into a "dump" of social programs whose objective

was clearly to see them wither on the vine.<p>

	<A NAME="second"><H3>Second Amendment</H3></A>

	

	<font size=5>I</font>n her article "Second Thoughts on the Second Amendment" (March

<i>Atlantic</i>), Wendy Kaminer characterizes the Supreme Court's decision in

<i>Presser </i>v.<i> Illinois</i> (1886) as being based on "now discredited"

reasoning. As her article notes, that case held that a state-law prohibition of

private militias did not violate the Second Amendment, because that amendment

was a limitation on federal, not state, power. However, her characterization of

its reasoning leaves the unfortunate impression that today the Second Amendment

limits a state's power to control firearms to the same (uncertain) extent that

it limits the power of the federal government to control them. This is

emphatically not the case. Although some of the reasoning of <i>Presser </i>may

not have stood the test of time, its conclusion that the Second Amendment does

not apply to the states has been followed by every court to consider the

matter.<p>



Before enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment, in 1868, it was settled

constitutional doctrine that none of the first eight amendments were

limitations on state power, only on federal power (<i>Barron </i>v.

<i>Baltimore</i>, 32 U.S. 243 [1833]). Since ratification of the Fourteenth

Amendment, however, the Supreme Court has gradually come to hold that most of

the rights expressed in the first eight amendments do limit state power--not by

their own force but because they are part and parcel of the "liberty" protected

by the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee that no state shall deprive any person

of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. However, the Supreme

Court has never held that the right to bear arms is one of the liberties

guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Unless it does, <i>Barron </i>v.

<i>Baltimore </i>and <i>Presser </i>v. <i>Illinois </i>must be taken to defeat

any argument that the states may not constitutionally control firearms.<p>



Lower federal courts and state courts that have addressed the question have

uniformly upheld the power of the states to control firearms. When petitions

have been submitted to the Supreme Court to review these decisions, they have

always been denied.<p>

<i>St. Augustine, Fla.</i><p>



     <br><br><br>



<font size=5>W</font><i></i>endy Kaminer misrepresents the views of Jews for the Preservation of

Firearms Ownership. First, "gun control" does not cause genocides: murderous

politicians and government bureaucrats plan and carry out genocides. In the

twentieth century, enforcement of gun-control laws is a necessary pre-condition

for genocide. Rwanda, where as many as 800,000 people were murdered between

April 7, 1994, and the end of June, 1994, enacted a "gun-control" law on

November 21, 1964. This law explains what is otherwise inexplicable: how so

many were murdered so fast by so few.<p>



Second, Kaminer also does not understand the central role that gun control

played in the Nazi genocide against six million Jews and seven million

gentiles. The Nazis inherited lists of all German firearms owners when they

took power in 1933. These lists were compiled under a 1928 law enacted by the

center-right Weimar Republic government. Insecure after winning election with

only 44 percent of the vote, the Nazis quickly seized firearms from those they

did not trust.<p>



Those inherited "gun-control" lists enabled the Nazis to get an iron grip on

Germany quickly. They then replaced most major laws, but they did not replace

the inherited gun-control law until March of 1938. By then two thirds of

Germany's Jews had fled, leaving only 200,000. In the wake of the Kristallnacht

the Nazis forbade Jews to own any weapons. This Nazi law appears to be the

basis for the U.S. Gun Control Act of 1968. <p>



<STRONG>Jay Edward Simkin</STRONG><br>



<i>Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership<br>



Milwaukee, Wis.</i><p>



<br><br><br>





<i>Wendy Kaminer replies:</i><p>



<font size=5>J</font>ay Simkin's letter demonstrates that I did not misrepresent his views

when I cited him for the proposition that gun control causes genocide. He states

that enforcement of gun-control laws is a "necessary precondition for

genocide," that gun control explains recent mass murders in Rwanda, and that

firearms seizures "enabled" the Nazis to consolidate their hold on Germany. In

an article published in <i>Guns and Ammo</i>, Simkin has characterized genocide

as the "downside" of gun control, citing seven major genocides of this century

that have been preceded by gun-control laws; he concludes that "gun-control

laws are the key to genocide. . . . To prevent further genocides, we must

destroy gun control." He complains that since 1945 "the link between gun control

and genocide has gone unrecognized."<p>



It is disingenuous of Simkin to deny that he has tried to persuade his readers

that a causal relationship (or "link") exists between gun control and genocide.

Perhaps he has never used the exact words "gun control causes genocide," but

that is what he leads people to believe.<p>



I am only a little less baffled by Thomas Rutherford's complaint. He suggests

that I have misled readers by pointing out (correctly) that the view of the Bill

of Rights as a limitation on federal but not state power has long been

discredited. As Rutherford notes, in a series of landmark cases decided during

this century the Supreme Court has made clear that the fundamental rights

guaranteed by the first ten amendments to the Constitution are

"incorporated" into the Fourteenth Amendment and govern the individual's

relationship with both state and federal governments. The Court has not ruled

that the right to bear arms is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment simply

because it has not made an underlying ruling about the Second Amendment. If the

Court ever decides that the Second Amendment provides a fundamental individual

right to bear arms, that right will no doubt be incorporated into the

Fourteenth Amendment as well.<p>

<A NAME="berlin"><H3>Irving Berlin</H3></A>



<font size=5>D</font>avid Schiff's tribute to Irving Berlin as a master lyricist as well as

composer ("For Everyman, by Everyman," March </u><cite>Atlantic</cite><u>) is

squarely on target. Unfortunately, two of the "ragged rhyme" examples Schiff

uses are actually revised lyrics dating from decades later than the composition

of the original songs. As such, they are less an example of Berlin's ability to

wed words and music perfectly than they are of a companion skill: wedging new

words into a previously composed melody.</u></b><p>



"I sit alone/With a table and a chair," from "All By Myself,"

probably dates from the 1950s; the original, 1921 lines are "I sit alone/In my

cozy Morris chair." Here one can see clearly Berlin's instinct for the

construction of singable poetry--the assonances (<i>o</i> and <i>s/z</i>) and

alliterations (<i>m</i> and <i>s</i>, the latter continuing with "so" and

"solitaire" in the next two lines). In addition, the juxtaposition of "cozy"

with, in the next line, "unhappy" sets up the overall sense and tension of the

song. "Table" damages all of this; it is hard to believe that Berlin (rather

than Irving Berlin, Inc.) was responsible for the updating.<p>



On the other hand, the "Rockefeller" lyric for "Puttin' on the Ritz," although

it also dates from the 1950s, is ingenious, but not as fluent as the original

"Harlem" lyric written in 1928 for Harry Richman. The revision is an early

example of political correctitude (probably made for Ella Fitzgerald's

<i>Irving Berlin Songbook</i>) rather than--as in "All By Myself"--reflecting

the simple necessity of removing an obsolete reference. The "Rockefeller" lyric

also seems to violate the meaning of "putting on the ritz," which Berlin

understood well. The phrase connotes pretension, and the Rockefellers had no

need to put on the ritz--they <i>were </i>the ritz!<p>

<i>Sussex, N.J.</i><p>

<i>David Schiff replies:</i><p>



I don't know if Maxwell E. Siegel is a musicologist--but he should be.

His comments open a whole new perspective on popular song. It would be

fascinating to trace the ways in which songs written for the fleeting present

become "timeless." As Mr. Siegel's letter indicates, it often is a question not

just of the quality of the song but of the suppression and emendation of dated

elements. I doubt that anyone could update "rotogravure" in "Easter Parade,"

however, even if few people today know what it means. I would hope, though, that

it is not necessary to label all changes in racial sensitivity "political

correctitude."<p>

<A NAME="child labor"><H3>Child Labor</H3></A><p>





<font size=5>W</font>hether by inadvertence or by design, positioning Stephen Carter's "The

Insufficiency of Honesty" immediately before Jonathan Silvers's "Child Labor in

Pakistan" (February <i>Atlantic</i>) was poignant beyond expression. To Carter,

"Integrity . . . requires three steps: discerning what is right and what is

wrong; acting on what you have discerned, even at personal cost; and saying

openly that you are acting on your understanding of right and wrong."<p>



The dimensions of the tragedy in Pakistan are greater than imagined. Thanks for

bringing this to our attention. But how should we respond? Corrective action

can be achieved only through individual action, not through government and

specifically not through U.S. government coercion or involvement. Reflexively,

the idea of foreign aid--or, worse, more foreign aid--is offered as the

solution. But time after time it has been demonstrated that foreign aid rarely

if ever benefits the people of foreign countries; on the contrary, foreign aid

acts as an independent financing source for loathsome foreign governments as an

entity apart from their people, enabling them to perpetuate tyranny upon their

people. In short, foreign aid permits these governments to remain unaccountable

to their people. In Pakistan it's the combination of an oppressive regime

coupled with do-nothing-ness. Laws protecting children are in place; they are

simply ignored.<p>



It is well beyond time that all foreign aid ended--and time for more Americans

to act with <i>individual </i>integrity. Not buying articles made by enslaved

children is a certain step in the right direction.<p>



<STRONG>Paul F. Galvin</STRONG><br>



<i>Dedham, Mass.</i><p>



<br><br><br>



<font size=5>W</font>estern consumers' response to child servitude in the carpet industry is

evidenced by a significant decline in imports. Pakistani carpet exports

suffered a sharp fall from June to December of 1995. Revenues were $48.5

million, down from $97.1 million a year earlier.<p>



Pakistani carpet manufacturers have cause for concern. Their industry is likely

to hit even harder times, given their denial of a child-labor problem and their

failure to establish Rugmark, a South Asian initiative to end child servitude

in the carpet industry. To date, Rugmark Foundations have been established in

India and Nepal.<p>



Establishing Rugmark goes a long way toward assuaging the concerns of consumers

about child labor. Manufacturers who do not use child labor and agree to

unannounced, independent inspections of their looms are certified to use the

Rugmark label on their carpets. The label assures consumers, retailers, and

importers that the hand-knotted carpet was made by adults, not children.<p>



South Asian child-advocacy and human-rights groups have made strong appeals to

U.S. consumers to refuse to buy hand-knotted carpets unless they bear the

Rugmark label. Consumer rejection of carpets not carrying the Rugmark label

will spur more manufacturers to commit to production without children and spur

more countries to adopt Rugmark. For more information about the U.S. Rugmark

Campaign, call the National Consumers League, in Washington, D.C., at

202-835-3323.<p>

<font size=5>J</font>onathan Silvers tries to convey the impression that Pakistan is an

exception to the emerging global trend against child labor and that the

government of Pakistan is responsible for allowing this problem to "assume

epidemic proportions." Child labor does prevail in Pakistan, but it is a

problem in many countries of southern Asia and, indeed, many other

underdeveloped countries.<p>



Since assuming office in October of 1993, the government of Prime Minister

Benazir Bhutto has taken several steps to eliminate bonded labor and to

eradicate the abuse of child labor in Pakistan. These include the strict

implementation of the Bonded Labor (Abolition) Act of 1992 and other relevant

laws, and arrest and prosecution of the culprits; the initiation of a national

survey of child labor in collaboration with the International Labor

Organization (ILO); the launching of a nationwide rehabilitation program for

working children; and the setting up of inspection teams to visit industrial

sites and factories regularly to monitor working conditions and to prevent any

abuse of child labor or use of bonded labor.<p>



Contrary to Silvers's claims, whenever its attention has been drawn to any

instance of bonded labor, the Bhutto government has acted to suppress it. For

instance, when Shakil Pathan, of the Independent Human Rights Commission of

Pakistan, pointed out the existence of a bonded-labor camp in District

Tharparkar in Sindh, the provincial government immediately busted the gang of

criminals involved and secured the release of the laborers.<p>



To discourage the use of child labor in manufacturing carpets exported by

Pakistan, the government has established the Rugmark Foundation with the help

of the ILO and other United Nations agencies. Under this arrangement all rugs

exported from Pakistan must carry this certification. It must also be clarified

that cases of child labor do not generally exist in the formal manufacturing

sectors--an important point that Silvers omitted. The small enterprises of the

informal sector that resort to child-labor practices generally hide them from

law-enforcement agencies because of the restrictive conditions prohibiting the

employment of minors.<p>



The death of Iqbal Masih, the crusader against child labor, was very sad and

unfortunate. According to an investigation conducted by the law-enforcement

authorities and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, the murder was

unrelated to Iqbal Masih's labor activism and did not involve the "carpet

mafia" alluded to by Ehsan Ulla Khan, as Silvers insinuates.<p>



Silvers's description of Islamabad as bristling with "world-class industries"

"staffed . . . by children and adolescents" is inaccurate: there are no

industries in Islamabad or its immediate vicinity, much less any that are

employing "ragged youths entering and exiting the brick factories, steel mills,

and stone-crushing plants at all hours of the day and night."<p>

<i>Jonathan Silvers replies:</i><p>



However admirable the Rugmark Foundation's intentions, some industry critics

suggest that it lacks a reliable monitoring system and cannot ensure that

members (whose looms are scattered across an area of 100,000 square miles) are

in fact complying with the child-free requirement. (I suspect that many are

not.) Worse yet, the Rugmark label, although a trademark, is easily

counterfeited. In Pakistan, at a carpet warehouse outside Islamabad, I watched

a ten-year-old boy sew fake Rugmark tags onto carpets destined for export to

Germany.<p>

Rifaat Hussain's letter represents the most extensive communication I've had to

date from a Pakistani official on the subject of child labor. In the weeks I

spent in Pakistan, my repeated requests for interviews with Benazir Bhutto,

government ministers, and bonded-labor specialists were denied, as were my

requests to observe so-called antislavery personnel in action. When I persisted

in my requests and asked for a child-welfare agent to accompany me to a carpet

factory where twenty children lived and worked (all between the ages of five

and eleven), the National Assembly press office in Islamabad threatened to

revoke my visa and arrest me for illegal entry. <p>



Pakistan's response to the child-labor crisis is a study in half measures. In

the early 1990s the National Assembly passed two landmark bills prohibiting

child and bonded labor, but it failed to make any provision for their

enforcement. The rehabilitation program and field-inspection teams that Dr.

Hussain mentions exist only on the drawing board; they are no closer to reality

than they were when they were first proposed, in 1990. It is true that last

year the national police raided several factories that used bonded labor; but

state prosecutors refused to charge the factory owners--or, for that matter, to

close the factories. As for Iqbal Masih's murder, a number of prominent

human-rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Anti-Slavery

International, believe that the investigation of it was compromised by

incompetence and malfeasance on the part of police investigators.<p>

Nine young men and women out of ten who will receive their	degrees this June would probably admit, if they were called to testify, that	education has acted as a poison to their faith. In many instances the virus	generated by the reasoning processes induces only mild distemper of skepticism,	but in others it works like an acid, eating its way into the bump of credulity	until in the end this estimable organ is completely corroded. Devout parents	and clergymen have frequently observed this phenomenon and deplored it. When	they discuss it, however, as they often do, they betray a common failure to	understand the intellectual chemistry which has produced this wholesale	apostasy of the younger generation.<p>		<p>		<p>		In these pages I propose to show how higher education reacts upon faith by	describing my own religious crisis just as it occurred while I was in college.	At the time, I had good reason to sift my doubts with unusual care. When I	entered Harvard in the fall of 1924, I was not only a Christian, I was also an	avowed candidate for the ministry. Then for four years I underwent a process of	mental readjustment which shook my little world to its foundations. Through it	all only one thing was clear to me: if I could reconcile religion with	intelligence, I knew that I could go on into my chosen career fortified by the	experience; if I could not, every consideration of honor would compel me to	make other plans. In the end I gave up the ministry.<p>		<p>		<p>		Because my crisis was so acute, I know what fundamental questions underlie the	intellectual reorientation which has become an inevitable part of the college	curriculum for every thinking student. From my own experience I can demonstrate	why it is that education so often spells the end of orthodoxy.<p>		<p>	<br>	<p>		<b>I.</b><p>		<p>		The environment in which I grew up was that of the typical middle-class	American home just after the turn of the century. Queen Victoria had been dead	five years when I came into the world, but her spirit lived on and was the	tutelary genius of my childhood and youth.<p>		<p>		<p>		I was born a good Presbyterian, and, fittingly enough, predestination played an	important role in my early life. Both of my parents were gentle, unaffected,	devoted Christians, and my father was an elder in the church. We lived in a	small city of the Middle West, on the fringe of what H.L. Mencken calls 'the	Bible Belt.' Long before I could be aware of it myself, the double accident of	parentage and geography had shaped me for the service of God.<p>		<p>		<p>		Our neighborhood was made up of families like mine. All social life was centred	in the church and its activities. Our minister, who was an intimate friend of	the family, was an upright old Scotsman, a living monument to all the Christian	virtues. He had served our parish almost as long as anybody could remember, and	his never-failing kindliness and charity made him universally beloved. <p>		<p>		<p>		My earliest distinct recollection is of family prayers. This was a regular	feature of our daily life. After supper we would retire to the library, where	my father, with wife and children gathered about him, would read a chapter from	the Scriptures. Psalms and Proverbs were his favorite books, and he repeated	them so often that I soon knew them by heart. After the reading came prayers,	during which each little event of the day would be rehearsed and we would give	thanks to God for all the good things we had enjoyed.<p>		<p>		<p>		It was natural that a child brought up in such a home should early come to	think of the God who ruled over it, whose presence was so imminently felt in	every department of daily life, as one of his most intimate acquaintances. He	was very real, this God of my childhood; as real as my father, and in fact	quite like him. There was nothing sinister about Him, nothing to incite	fear--except, of course, when I disobeyed Him. He was merely the head of the	world as my father was head of our household. The ways of both were often	inscrutable to me, but I never doubted their ultimate wisdom and their concern	for my own good.<p>		<p>		<p>		By the time I came to the age of reason the system under which I had grown up	had implanted in my mind certain clear ideas about the universe and my place in	it. The world was created by God as a laboratory for testing human beings. In	the Bible He had revealed His commandments, which were distinct, direct, and	admitted of no argument. Obedience to these injunctions was virtue,	disobedience sin. The one meant honor and happiness and life everlasting; the	other was the way of shame and disgrace in this world, and led to eternal	torments in the world to come.<p>		<p>		<p>		God, however, was more than a moralist. He was also an engineer. The world	which He had fashioned was not an automatic mechanism. It had been set going in	the beginning by its Creator, and he, like a good mechanic, had been tinkering	with it ever since. The forces that moved it were direct manifestations of His	power. 'The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his	handywork.' If He could save men from their sins, He could also protect them	against accidents, diseases, and the shafts of their enemies. Faith and good	works, then, were not only the way of the soul's salvation, they were also the	best kind of insurance against the stings of fortune while one lived.<p>		<p>		<p>		These religious concepts were laid down in the Scriptures and were supported by	a kind of evidence in everyday life. God was constantly being moved by the	prayers of the just to repeat in our day the miracles He had performed in	ancient times. Everyone who had eyes could see it for himself. Did not our	pastor often intercede for the recovery of the sick, and did they not usually	get well? Did he not pray every Sunday that the President of the United States	would be given wisdom to lead the affairs of the nation, and was not our	prosperity the manifest answer? It was all very simple and all very right, and	surely the way of the transgressor was hard.<p>		<p>		<p>		But, you say, these were the ideas of a child. True, and the child got them	from his parents, who shared them item by item with the neighbors, who held the	same beliefs in common with one hundred million other people in all the	Middletowns of America.<p>		<p>	<br>	<p>		<b>II.</b><p>		<p>		It would hardly be possible to exaggerate the importance of a wonder-working	God in this Christian scheme of things which I took for granted with the air I	breathed. Innumerable stories from the Bible, moreover, indicate that such a	Deity was also taken for granted by every one of the Scriptural heroes from	Adam down to John of Patmos. Through all the centuries of religious history	this idea has persisted, which would seem to indicate that a God who kicks over	the traces of natural law and upsets the normal sequence of cause and effect	occupies an important place--if not, indeed, the central place--in Christian	cosmology.<p>		<p>		<p>		I am well aware that in certain churches to-day even the clergy are disposed to	pass lightly over the miracles. This tendency, however, is wholly confined to	the more liberal churches, whose communicants are sophisticated people. Such	parishes are not really representative of Christianity, for the obvious reason	that their members are not representative of the rank and file of humanity.	Sophisticated folk, if they go to church at all, tend to do it as a matter of	form and fashion; they are moved by no strong convictions.<p>		<p>		<p>		To find the original God of Christianity still resplendent in all His glory,	still hurling His thunderbolts and making no concessions to rationalism, one	should go preferably to a Roman Catholic Church--to the shrine, say, of Saint	Anne de Beaupre or Our Lady of Lourdes. There one comes into the awful presence	of a real God, who heals the sick, gives sight to the blind, makes the crippled	walk, rewards the just, damns the wicked, and in all the vicissitudes of life	is able to give tangible evidence of His power in answer to prayer. And the	same Deity, less colorful, perhaps, but no less real, will be found among the	Baptists, the Lutherans, the Methodists, the Congregationalists, the	Presbyterians, and every other sect of Protestantism.<p>		<p>		<p>		This was the God of my childhood. And He still reigns in undimmed majesty over	the lives of millions, whose supplications continue to move Him just as	effectively as they did in the days of Abraham. Here, for example, is a	testimonial taken from the Chicago Tribune of August 28 last:--<p>		<p>		<p>		"The steeple of the Presbyterian Theological Seminary, at 2330 North Halsted	Street, was struck by lightning and set afire. One hundred and seventy-five	theological students, residents of a near-by dormitory, rushed into the street	in a downpour of rain to help the firemen fight the blaze. Dr. John Timothy	Stone, president of the Seminary, heard the crash when the steeple was struck.	He rushed out into the storm and called upon the students who were helping to	fight the blaze to pray. Dr. Stone and his students knelt on the rain-soaked	grass and offered a prayer for the safety of the building. The firemen were	unable to get into the steeple, and by the time they had raised a fire tower	and trained a hose on the fire an hour later the rain had put out the blaze."<p>		<p>		<p>		It is hardly necessary to point out that Dr. Stone's action was entirely	consistent with his beliefs as a good Presbyterian. In his moment of danger he	did what every religious man or woman does instinctively under similar	circumstances: he appealed to the wonder-working God who presides over the	Christian universe. And I dare say the good Doctor has already used the	incident to point the moral in some stirring sermon.<p>		<p>		<p>		I emphasize the importance of this God of magic because He is the source of	most of the difficulties with which the churches now find themselves beset.	They cannot give Him up and remain Christian; they cannot keep Him and retain	the loyalty of educated people. It is a critical dilemma indeed. I was soon to	face it in my own life, but at the time of which I write I had no suspicion	that it existed.<p>		<p>	<br>	<p>		<b>III.</b><p>		<p>		I arrived at the age of eighteen comfortably adjusted to the Christian universe	in which all things work together for good to them that love God. The example	set by my family, and indeed by the entire community in which we lived,	convinced me of the truth and justice of the divine plan. As I began to think	seriously of what I should do with my life, everything pointed to the ministry	as the ideal solution. Christian living was the way of happiness. And what	better use could any man make of his powers than to devote them to the	propagation of truth, so that others who had been denied it might be led to	share its beneficent effects? The decision hardly called for conscious	effort.<p>		<p>		<p>		So in due course I went before the Presbytery of the church, where, to the	delight of my parents, I was accepted as a candidate for the ministry. The	church to which we belonged published a little quarterly, and the next issue	carried my picture with this word of explanation: 'Philip E. Wentworth, who	came before Presbytery last spring, will start his college work this fall	preparatory to entering the Christian ministry.'<p>		<p>		<p>		The question was: What college? Without going into the detailed considerations	that influenced my judgment in this matter, suffice it to say that I finally	settled upon Harvard. My father was not a college graduate, but he was bent on	giving me the advantages of formal education which he had lacked, and he was	satisfied to leave the choice to me. But I met unexpected resistance when I	sought the advice of our pastor.<p>		<p>		<p>		He was uneasy when he learned that I was thinking of going to Harvard. Of	course it was a fine university, but the Unitarians had smirched it. He	reminded me that the Unitarian Church was the only Protestant denomination from	which transfers of membership were not freely accepted by the Presbyterians.	Before a Unitarian could be welcomed into our communion he had to be closely	examined, for the title of his sect was a denial of the Trinity. Harvard, the	minister said, had been the Sorbonne of Unitarianism, and I should run a grave	risk of learning false doctrine if I went there.<p>		<p>		<p>		Instead of flying in the face of Providence, I should do better, he said, to	consider his own college. It was a small institution in Missouri, founded and	supervised by the synod of our church. It had educated many eminent	Presbyterian ministers. I could go there knowing that I should be safe from all	the insidious temptations of rationalism.<p>		<p>		<p>		He urged me eloquently, but I stood my ground. When I went before Presbytery I	had sworn allegiance to truth and I did not think it would prove to be as frail	a vessel as the good dominie's counsel implied. I suspected that it might turn	out, on closer acquaintance, to be a little too broad to fit into any narrow	creed. I was not primarily interested in dogma anyhow. Sufficient unto the	seminary would be the evils thereof. First, I would widen my general knowledge.	Then, even if it should be necessary to modify some of my doctrines, I felt	certain that the fundamental verities of religion would remain impregnable.<p>		<p>		<p>		So to Harvard I went. On a September evening in 1924, I called to say good-bye	to the old minister, who, throughout his long friendship with the family, had	been almost a second father to me. In the quiet of his study he knelt beside me	and offered up a fervent petition to God to make me diligent in the pursuit of	truth. Dear faithful soul! Within a year he was dead and was spared the pain of	learning that his parting prayer was being answered--in a sense the irony of	which he could never have understood.<p>		<p>	<br>	<p>		<b>IV.</b><p>		<p>		Before I went to college I was thoroughly at home in a universe which revolved	about the central figure of an omnipotent Deity. In Cambridge I was suddenly	plunged into another world. I found myself breathing a wholly different	atmosphere. My teachers spoke a new language; their words were familiar enough,	but the import of them was strange to me. It was essentially a difference in	attitude and point of view.<p>		<p>		<p>		The change was first brought home to me in the study of history. To my mind the	rise of Christianity out of the ashes of imperial Rome had seemed the material	evidence of a transcendental truth--a revelation of the hand of God at work in	the affairs of men. Not so to my professors. All events in history were	manifestations of cause and effect operating upon the natural level. The	institutions of society evolved according to orderly processes. Religion was	itself subject to these processes. I shall never forget one lecture from the	fierce, bloodthirsty Yahweh, tribal Deity of a few Semitic nomads, through	successive stages until He finally emerged in the New Testament as the gentle,	merciful, forgiving Father of all mankind.<p>		<p>		<p>		In the course of time the impact of new knowledge, and especially knowledge of	science and the scientific method, wrought great havoc with my original ideas.	All things, it seemed, were subject to the laws of nature. This concept	supplied my mind with a wholly new pattern into which my religious beliefs	refused to fit. In such an orderly universe there seemed to be no place for a	wonder-working God. He would be an outlaw, unthinkable and impossible. The	bottom dropped out of my world, and I wrestled with myself in a futile attempt	to patch it up.<p>		<p>		<p>		What, then, about morals? Without an omnipotent Deity to reward virtue and	punish evil, was 'the good life' only an illusion? I could not believe it, yet	I could think of no satisfactory answer. Life had lost its meaning. I was	desolate.<p>		<p>		<p>		Perhaps, though, I could still rehabilitate God by setting Him up as the First	Cause--the moving power behind natural law. But there was small comfort in this	thought. A God who had created the world and then left it to govern itself by	natural law had hedged Himself about by barriers through which even He could	not break. Prayers could not move Him. Though He might exist, He could not be	of service to man. Obviously such a God would be too remote, too inaccessible,	for the purposes of religion.<p>		<p>		<p>		I saw, too, that the Modernists were troubled by these same difficulties. In	their haste to strike up a compromise with the intellectuals, they were trying	hard to make a self-respecting Deity out of the nebulous What-Is-It of	Eddington and Millikan. It seemed to me that they had fallen between two	stools. I studied philosophy and read further about this First Cause. Then I	began to marvel at the disingenuousness of the human mind when, unable to	imagine how the world began, but demanding some explanation of the	inexplicable, it can arbitrarily select three letters from the alphabet and	call g-o-d an answer. I preferred to think that we know more about such matters	when we admit we know nothing than when we resort to such palpable	self-deception.<p>		<p>		<p>		While I was debating these problems so basic to my religious beliefs, the	controversy between Fundamentalists and Modernists was coming to a head, and	the impending Scopes trial in Tennessee was shocking the conscience of	thoughtful men everywhere. These events helped to clarify my thinking. I saw	that the battle had been joined between religion and intelligence. Was faith,	then, simply a defense of ignorance, a substitute for thinking?<p>		<p>		<p>		In the summer of 1925, I followed the proceedings at Dayton with intense	interest, and one aspect of the dispute over evolution struck me particularly.	Learned scientists and liberal clergy-men were brought to testify for the	defense. Their evidence was not admitted at the trial, as I recall it, but all	of them gave out statements to the press, and they were unanimous in saying	that there was no real conflict between religion and science. This struck me as	a downright evasion of the issue. The quarrel was not between religion and	science in the abstract. The pious legislators of Tennessee had taken it upon	themselves to protect one specific and clearly stated postulate of Christianity	against the equally concrete and definite theory of evolution. What was the	conflict here?<p>		<p>		<p>		The controversy raged, as everyone knows, over the first chapter of Genesis.	Now why should religious folk set such store by that text? In explaining how	the world was created in six days, the story of Genesis clearly established God	in the central conning tower of the universe and conferred upon Him the	omnipotent powers. He needed to control the mechanism. Thus it affirmed the	first great postulate of Christianity: An all-powerful God rules over the world	of His creation. But that is not all. From this premise is derived a corollary	of the first importance to religion: Man is dependent for his safety in this	world and his salvation in the next upon the God who made him.<p>		<p>		<p>		Here, then, is the religious significance of the Biblical story of creation.	The lawmakers of Tennessee maintained, therefore, that the story was	fundamental to Christianity, and in this it would appear that they were better	theologians (however tenuous their claim to greatness in the law) than the	liberal clergymen who tried to refute them. For the Christian religion rests in	large part upon the foundation of those assumptions laid down in the first	chapter of Genesis. The moral code is directly derived from	the special relationship there established between God and man.<p>		<p>		<p>		Now what happens to this nicely rationalized system of religious beliefs when	scientific notions are superimposed upon them? The God of Christianity becomes	enclosed in a circle of natural law from which He cannot escape. He is deprived	of His freedom to interfere with the normal sequence of cause and effect. He is	no longer able to play the role of Cosmic Policeman, meting out vengeance and	punishment to evildoers and offering protection and rewards to the just. The	elaborate sanctions which religion has built up to enforce its code vanish into	thin air.<p>		<p>		<p>		Thus, in the field of action, a conflict of primary importance is set up	between Christianity and scientific ideas. Mystic rites, sacrifice,	supplication, and prayer are typical modes of religious behavior, and they are	conditioned by religious beliefs. People who have oriented themselves to a	scientific universe go about their affairs in other ways. Dr. John Timothy	Stone and the firemen approached their common problem differently.<p>		<p>		<p>		Having reached these conclusions, I realized that if I was to continue to	believe in the good life I should have to look beyond the teachings of	orthodoxy for my reasons. The supernatural had become meaningless. No longer	able to lean upon the gods, I must learn to stand alone.<p>		<p>	<br>	<p>		<b>V.</b><p>		<p>		It so happened that I stayed in the East each summer vacation and had not been	home since I first entered Harvard as a freshman. Meanwhile, I had written	innumerable letters to my parents, acquainting them with all the successive	changes which my ideas had undergone. They were sorely troubled. At first they	contented themselves with giving me well-intentioned advice to pray and read my	Bible constantly. If I did this, my doubts would surely pass, for God was	testing me and would not desert me if I proved steadfast. When at last, toward	the end of my sophomore year, I wrote them that prayer had lost its meaning,	they concluded that they would have to take heroic measures to save me from	myself. I received a long letter from my father.<p>		<p>		<p>		He was now convinced, he said, that my going to Harvard had been a ghastly	mistake. Two years of it threatened to destroy the faith which had been	instilled into me from birth. If I continued in my present course, he could	never forgive himself for failing to heed the advice of our old pastor, who had	foreseen exactly what had happened to me. 'For what shall it profit a man, if	he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?' He was convinced,	therefore, that it would be best for me to plan on not returning to Cambridge	in the fall. If I preferred, he would be willing to let me do nothing at all	the next year; I could stay at home and get my bearings anew. After that I	could make a fresh start and go on with my studies at the Presbyterian college	in Missouri, which he had now concluded was the proper place for me. Of course	I was no longer a child to be governed wholly by others; I should have to make	my own decisions and take the consequences. But in this important matter he	urged me to consider well and be guided by his maturer judgment. <p>		<p>		<p>		Needless to say, this letter was very disturbing to me. I could understand and	sympathize with my father's feelings. But, much as I regretted to displease	him, I could not ruthlessly suppress my own convictions. I wrote him to this	effect and begged him to allow me to complete the studies which I had begun. I	had seen enough of a progressive university and its methods of stimulating	students to think for themselves to know that I should never be able to bear	the hothouse environment of a denominational college. After the interchange of	several letters my father finally capitulated, although he said it went sorely	against his conscience.<p>		<p>		<p>		That third year at Harvard was much less distressing to my peace of mind than	the first two had been. The uncertainties which new knowledge had bred no	longer paralyzed me. Other certainties began to take form as I set about	building up a tenable philosophy of my own. By the end of my junior year these	ideas had begun to shake down and adjust themselves to the new pattern which my	mind had accepted. <p>		<p>		<p>		It was now out of the question for me to entertain any hope that I might be	able to reconcile my new philosophy of life with those religious assumptions	which I had formerly taken for granted. I could not become a Christian	minister. Instead, I found myself strongly attracted toward an academic career.	But I was still enrolled as a candidate for holy orders, and it was incumbent	upon me to notify Presbytery of my withdrawal.<p>		<p>		<p>		Back home our old pastor was dead, and a younger man who had formerly assisted	him had taken his place. So to him I wrote, in April 1927, outlining the change	in my beliefs just as I have explained it here, and asking him to lay the	matter before Presbytery. Within a few days I received his answer. His letter	was cordial and tolerant, but it demonstrated so conclusively the impotence of	the Church to deal with, or even to understand, the problem of my generation	that I shall quote it in full.<p>		<p><blockquote>			  April 16,1927<p>		<p>		MY DEAR PHILIP,<p>		<p>		Your father had frequently talked with me about your difficulties. I was	therefore not unprepared for your letter, although the Philip who speaks in	these pages is an altogether different Philip from the one who left us less	than three years ago. <p>		<p>		<p>		I need not tell you how sorry I am that you have had to go through this crisis.	Most of us, some time or other in our college lives, have had to face the very	problems that are yours. If a man thinks at all, such questions are bound to	torment him sooner or later. Knowing you as I do, I am sure that you have been	honest in facing them. Still, it is the way a man answers that really matters;	his doubts may always either make him or break him.<p>		<p>		<p>		I shall not attempt to debate the points which you have raised. You ought to	know already how faith can move such mountains of doubt as the unguided reason	may build up. There is only one thought that I should like to place before you.	As you have been looking at the fact of Christianity from the point of view of	a personal God, have you been absolutely fair in seeking the proof on both	sides? By that I mean, have you been reading your Bible, praying, and trying to	believe, or have you just taken the external view that it cannot be so, and	tried to prove <b> that</b> by your thought and reading? Not one of us could keep his	faith in any vital matter if he listened only to those who argue against it.	Religion isn't a question of logic or reason, although there is logic in it and	a man has to have a reason for the faith that is within him.<p>		<p>		<p>		However, I am not going to harass you with a sermon. I want you to know that	whatever you do and wherever you go I still count you one of my true friends.	Whether it means anything to you or not, I am going to pray for Gods' blessing	upon you, that He may lead you out into the fullest life. You are still	numbered here as one of ours, and always will be. If at any time I can serve	you in any way, you have only to let me know. And be assured of this--that with	my hand goes my heart.<p>		<p>		                               Yours faithfully, etc.<p></blockquote>		<p>		<p>		There is something very touching in the manifest sincerity of such an appeal.	But what good is it to urge a man to pray when the whole system of religious	conceptions has lost its validity for him?<p>		<p>	<br>	<p>		<b>VI.</b><p>		<p>		In 1928, I took my degree from Harvard. Four years have now elapsed since then,	and my ideas have undergone no important modification. Subsequent studies have	confirmed me in the point of view which I have indicated here, and I remain	irretrievably lost to religion. This is a source of permanent chagrin to my	family. The years have tended to cover over the wound, to the extent that we	never discuss the difference in our opinions; but underneath the tacit	acceptance of our disagreement I know that my parents nurse a secret hurt too	deep for time to heal. In their prayers and meditations I am sure that while	they live they will not cease to plead with their God for my redemption.<p>		<p>		<p>		Thus it will appear from my little history that we members of the skeptical	younger generation are a problem. It is an inevitable consequence of America's	generous passion for education. Thousands of young men and women go to college	each year from homes more or less like mine, to return changed beyond	recognition in all their ideas. And a few thoughtful appraisers of our social	trends, men like James Truslow Adams and Walter Lippmann, who are not believers	themselves, seem to agree with clergymen and the more devout parents in	thinking that the transformation is not always a change for the better.<p>		<p>		<p>		In this they are probably right. College not only may, but often does, deprive	a student of his religious convictions without giving him anything to take	their place. Christianity, after all, is a composite of two elements: one	purports to explain the nature of the world and man's relationship to the God	who rules over it; the other prescribes a course of conduct the sanctions of	which are derived from this relationship. The really serious dangers of	skepticism become apparent when a student rejects the supernatural part of his	religion and concludes that there are no valid reasons left for decent conduct.	Robbed of standards, he is likely to adopt the easy ethics of business, which	permit a man to do almost anything so long as it leads to success in	money-making. This commercial point of view is rapidly becoming the real	philosophy of the nation, as Mr. Adams brilliantly demonstrates in The Epic of	America.<p>		<p>		<p>		If a life of pure acquisitiveness becomes the ideal of college students they	can find reasons to justify themselves in some of the new theories of	psychology. These doctrines tend to glorify the illimitable expansion of the	ego as 'self-expression,' and create in uncritical minds the notion that it is	foolish, even harmful to health, to try to suppress one's desires--a favorite	dogma of Freud and the psychoanalysts. In this connection it seems to me very	strange that, despite our cult of science, we have not yet grasped the full	import of the new knowledge that has come to us from the laboratory. The	usefulness of the physical sciences is measured by the power they have given	mankind to control the forces of nature. Control is the essence of scientific	purpose. But the new psychology, calling itself a science, has supplemented the	decay of religion to rob us of control over <b>human</b> nature--that is, over our	appetites.<p>		<p>		<p>		One solution of this dilemma may lie in the creation of a philosophy which,	without calling upon the supernatural, will reassert the effectiveness of the	human will as an instrument for governing the desires and impulses. Then it	will be possible to restore to good ordor the essentially <b>human</b> values of life	which lift us above the level of mere animal instinct. The system of ethics	which would be enforced by such a philosophy would not be strikingly different	in many particulars from the moral code of Christianity, but the reasons for	obeying it would be found wholly in the satisfactions of the good life itself,	not in the promise of reward or punishment after death.<p>		<p>		<p>		But only a congenital optimist could bring himself to believe that a mere	system of ethics, however satisfying to the intellect, could ever take the	place of religion among the masses. Most men and women are incapable of	sustained self-control. Greed, pride, lust, are too much for them. They can be	held to the path of duty only by some power outside themselves--some higher	authority which is able to generate repressive fears stronger than their native	passions. Over vast multitudes the Church has for centuries enforced an	external discipline of precisely this kind.<p>		<p>		<p>		When religion begins to lose its hold upon the minds of men, as it is now doing	with us, a peculiar thing happens. The Church is driven by its own weakness to	shift its social responsibilities to other shoulders. Now there is only one	other institution strong enough to take on new burdens in such an emergency,	and it is an institution which, like the Church, has always been engaged in	forcing a measure of parental control upon men who either would not or could	not control themselves. This is the State. As religion becomes inoperative,	governments are overworked.<p>		<p>		<p>		In America at the present moment there is ample evidence that this peculiar	dislocation of function has already reached an acute stage. The ineffectiveness	of Christianity as a social force is revealed, on the one hand, in an outbreak	of crime the seriousness of which is common knowledge; and the government has	not yet been able to devise satisfactory measures for dealing with it. The	Church, on the other hand, aware of its weakness, aware that it can no longer	command obedience to its teaching by the time-honored method of invoking the	wrath of God, is led to lean more and more heavily upon the State, borrowing	secular support for purely religious injunctions. The sad plight of	Christianity in Tennessee, which has had to call upon the law for official	protection against evolution, is a symbol of spiritual decadence. National	prohibition is another sign of the same thing writ large. Thus for some years	the churches have been abdicating in their own field and putting their faith in	legal restraints.<p>		<p>		<p>		It is no accident, then, that the groups which are demanding ever more	stringent laws to regulate our private lives are identical, almost to a man,	with the religious groups in the population. It makes no difference whether	they are Protestants clamoring for stricter enforcement of prohibition or	Catholics agitating for stricter legislation regarding the dissemination of	birth-control information. In both instances increasing pressure is being	brought to bear upon government to take over the practical functions of	religion--and for the obvious reason that religion, in its decay, is no longer	able to do its work in the world.<p>		<p>		<p>		Though I am an apostate, I must admit, therefore, that it gives me no	satisfaction to realize what a large company of young men and women now share	the label with me. But I see no help for it. The Church has lost its power to	move us. Its conceptions seem as unreal to my generation as the gods of ancient	Greece.<p>		<p>		<p>		The breakdown of Christianity is particularly unfortunate in America, where our	educators are so busy building new dormitories and thinking up new systems of	instruction that they do not see how urgently the situation calls upon them to	redefine the purposes for which their pedagogical machinery exists. In so far	as the colleges destroy religious faith without substituting a vital philosophy	to take its place, they are turning loose upon the world young barbarians who	have been freed from the discipline of the Church before they have learned how	to discipline themselves. Perhaps this was what one of my least orthodox	Harvard professors had in mind when he once said: 'There are only a few men in	the world who have earned the right <b>not</b> to be Christians.' </blockquote><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1932 by Philip E.

<blockquote>	

	<font size=5>N</font>ot long ago a distinguished critic, reviewing Father Tabb's poetry, remarked,
'At his most obvious affinity, Emily Dickinson, I can only glance. It seems to
me that he contains in far finer form pretty much everything that is valuable
in her thought.' Are we thus to lose the fine significance of poetic
individuality? A poet is unique, incomparable, and to make these comparisons
between poets is to ignore the primary laws of criticism, which seeks to
discover the essential individuality of writers, not their chance resemblances.
It is as futile as it is unjust to parallel Father Tabb's work with Emily
Dickinson's: his is full of quiet reverie, hers has a sharp stabbing quality
which disturbs and overthrows the spiritual ease of the reader. Emily Dickinson
is one of our most original writers, a force destined to endure in American
letters.<p>

<p>

There is no doubt that critics are justified in complaining that her work is
often cryptic in thought and unmelodious in expression. Almost all of her poems
are written in short measures, in which the effect of curt brevity is increased
by her verbal penuriousness. Compression and epigrammatical ambush are her
aids; she proceeds, without preparation or apology, by sudden, sharp zigzags.
What intelligence a reader has must be exercised in the poetic game of
hare-and-hounds, where ellipses, inversions, and unexpected climaxes mislead
those who pursue sweet reasonableness. Nothing, for instance, could seem less
poetical than this masterpiece of unspeakable sounds and chaotic rhymes:--<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>COCOON

Drab habitation of whom? 
Tabernacle or tomb, 
Or dome of worm, 
Or porch of gnome, 
Or some elf's catacomb.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

If all her poems were of this sort there would be nothing more to say; but such
poems are exceptions. Because we happen to possess full records of her varying
poetic moods, published, not with the purpose of selecting her most artistic
work, but with the intention of revealing very significant human documents, we
are not justified in singling out a few bizarre poems and subjecting these to
skeptical scrutiny. The poems taken in their entirety are a surprising and
impressive revelation of poetic attitude and of poetic method in registering
spiritual experiences. To the general reader many of the poems seem uninspired,
imperfect, crude, while to the student of the psychology of literary art they
offer most stimulating material for examination, because they enable one to
penetrate into poetic origins, into radical, creative energy. However, it is
not with the body of her collected poems but with the selected, representative
work that the general reader is concerned. Assuredly we do not judge an artist
by his worst, but by his best, productions; we endeavor to find the highest
level of his power and thus to discover the typical significance of his work.<p>

<p>

To gratify the aesthetic sense was never Emily Dickinson's desire; she despised
the poppy and mandragora of felicitous phrases which lull the spirit to apathy
and emphasize art for art's sake. Poetry to her was the expression of vital
meanings, the transfer of passionate feeling and of deep conviction. Her work
is essentially lyric; it lacks the slow, retreating harmonies of epic measures,
it does not seek to present leisurely details of any sort; its purpose is to
objectify the swiftly-passing moments and to give them poignant expression .<p>

<p>

Lyric melody finds many forms in her work. Her repressed and austere verses,
inexpansive as they are, have persistent appeal. Slow, serene movement gives
enduring beauty to these elegiac stanzas:--

<blockquote>
<pre>Let down the bars, O Death! 
The tired flocks come in 
Whose bleating ceases to repeat,
Whose wandering is done.

Thine is the stillest night, 
Thine the securest fold; 
Too near thou art for seeking thee, 
Too tender to be told.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

The opposite trait of buoyant alertness is illustrated in the cadences of the
often-quoted lines on the hummingbird:--

<blockquote>
<pre>A route of evanescence
With a revolving wheel; 
A resonance of emerald, 
A rush of cochineal.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

Between these two margins come many wistful, pleading, or triumphant notes. The
essential qualities of her music are simplicity and quivering responsiveness to
emotional moods. Idea and expression are so indissolubly fused in her work that
no analysis of her style and manner can be attempted without realizing that
every one of her phrases, her changing rhythms, is a direct reflection of her
personality. The objective medium is entirely conformable to the inner life, a
life of peculiarly dynamic force which agitates, arouses, spurs the reader.<p>

<p>

The secret of Emily Dickinson's wayward power seems to lie in three special
characteristics, the first of which is her intensity of spiritual experience.
Hers is the record of a soul endowed with unceasing activity in a world not
material, but one where concrete facts are the cherished revelation of divine
significances. Inquisitive always, alert to the inner truths of life, impatient
of the brief destinies of convention, she isolated herself from the petty
demands of social amenity. A sort of tireless, probing energy of mental action
absorbed her, yet there is little speculation of a purely philosophical sort in
her poetry. Her stubborn beliefs, learned in childhood, persisted to the
end,--her conviction that life is beauty, that love explains grief, and that
immortality endures. The quality of her writing is profoundly stirring, because
it betrays, not the intellectual pioneer, but the acutely observant woman,
whose capacity for feeling was profound. The still, small voice of tragic
revelation one hears in these compressed lines:--<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>PARTING

My life closed twice before its close;
     It yet remains to see
If Immortality unveil
     A third event to me,

So huge, so hopeless to conceive,
     As these that twice befell.
Parting is all we know of heaven,
     And all we need of hell.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

For sheer, grim, unrelieved expression of emotional truth there are few
passages which can surpass the personal experience revealed in the following
poem:-- <p>

<blockquote>
<pre>Pain has an element of blank; 
It cannot recollect 
When it began, or if there were 
A day when it was not.

It has no future but itself,
Its infinite realms contain
Its past, enlightened to perceive
New periods of pain.
</pre>
</blockquote>


Her absorption in the world of feeling found some relief in associations with
nature; yet although she loved nature and wrote many nature lyrics, her
interpretations are always more or less swayed by her own state of being. The
colors, the fragrances, the forms of the material world, meant to her a divine
symbolism; but the spectacle of nature had in her eyes a more fugitive glory, a
lesser consolation, than it had for Wordsworth and other true lovers of the
earth.

<p>

Brilliant and beautiful transcripts of bird-life and of flower-life appear
among her poems, although there is in some cases a childish fancifulness that
disappoints the reader. Among the touches of unforgettable vividness there
are:--

<blockquote>
<pre>These are the days when skies put on
The old, old sophistries of June,--
A blue and gold mistake;
</pre>
</blockquote>


and<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>Nature rarer uses yellow
     Than another hue;
Leaves she all of that for sunsets,--
     Prodigal of blue
     </pre>
     </blockquote>

<p>

Never has any poet described the haunting magic of autumnal days with such fine
perception of beauty as marks the opening stanzas of 'My Cricket':--<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>Farther in summer than the birds, 
Pathetic from the grass, 
A minor nation celebrates 
Its unobtrusive mass.

No ordinance is seen,
So gradual the grace,
A pensive custom it becomes,
Enlarging loneliness.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

Most effective, however, are those poems where she describes not mere external
beauty, but, rather, the effect of nature upon a sensitive observer:--<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>There's a certain slant of light, 
On winter afternoons, 
That oppresses, like the weight 
Of cathedral tunes.

Heavenly hurt it gives us;
We can find no scar,
But internal difference
Where the meanings are.

None may teach it anything, 
'T is the seal, despair,-- 
An imperial affliction 
Sent us of the air.

When it comes, the landscape listens,
Shadows hold their breath;
When it goes, 't is like the distance
On the look of death.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

It is essentially in the world of spiritual forces that her depth of poetic
originality is shown. Others may describe nature, but few can describe life as
she does. Human nature, the experiences of the world of souls, was her special
study, to which she brought, in addition to that quality of intensity, a second
characteristic,--keen sensitiveness to irony and paradox. Nearly all her
perceptions are tinged with penetrating sense of the contrasts in human
vicissitude. Controlled, alert, expectant, aware of the perpetual compromise
between clay and spirit, she accepted the inscrutable truths of life in a
fashion which reveals how humor and pathos contend in her. It is this which
gives her style those sudden turns and that startling imagery. Humor is not,
perhaps, a characteristic associated with pure lyric poetry, and yet Emily
Dickinson's transcendental humor is one of the deep sources of her supremacy.
Both in thought and in expression she gains her piercing quality, her
undeniable spiritual thrust, by this gift, stimulating, mystifying, but forever
inspiring her readers to a profound conception of high destinies.<p>

<p>

The most apparent instances of this keen, shrewd delight in challenging
convention, in the effort to establish, through contrast, reconcilement of the
earthly and the eternal, are to be found in her imagery. Although her similes
and metaphors may be devoid of languid aesthetic elegance, they are quivering
to express living ideas, and so they come surprisingly close to what we are
fond of calling the commonplace. She reverses the usual, she hitches her star
to a wagon, transfixing homely daily phrases for poetic purposes. Such an
audacity has seldom invaded poetry with a desire to tell immortal truths
through the medium of a deep sentiment for old habitual things. It is true that
we permit this liberty to the greatest poets, Shakespeare, Keats, Wordsworth,
and some others; but in America our poets have been sharply charged not to
offend in this respect. Here tradition still animates many critics in the
belief that real poetry must have exalted phraseology.<p>

<p>

The poem already quoted, ' Let down the bars, O Death!' has its own rustic
vividness of association. Even more homely is the domestic suggestion wherewith
the poet sets forth an eternally, profoundly significant fact:--<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>The trying on the utmost,
     The morning it is new,
Is terribler than wearing it
     A whole existence through
     </pre>
     </blockquote>

<p>

Surely such a commonplace comparison gives startling vividness to the innate
idea. Many are the poetic uses she makes of practical everyday life:--<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>The soul should always stand ajar;
</pre>
</blockquote>

and<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>The only secret people keep 
Is Immortality;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

and<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>Such dimity convictions,
     A horror so refined,
Of freckled human nature, 
     Of Deity ashamed;
     </pre>
     </blockquote>

<p>

and<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>And kingdoms, like the orchard,
Flit russetly away;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

and<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>If I couldn't thank you,
     Being just asleep,
You will know I'm trying
     With my granite lip.
     </pre>
     </blockquote>

<p>

More significantly, however, than in these epithets and figures, irony and
paradox appear in those analyses of truth where she reveals the deep note of
tragic idealism:--<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>Not one of all the purple host 
Who took the flag to-day
Can tell the definition, 
So clear, of victory,

As he, defeated, dying, 
On whose forbidden ear 
The distant strains of triumph 
Break, agonized and clear;
</pre>
</blockquote>


and<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>Essential oils are wrung
The alter from the rose
Is not expressed by suns alone,
It is the gift of screws.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

She took delight in piquing the curiosity, and often her love of mysterious
challenging symbolism led her to the borderland of obscurity. No other of her
poems has, perhaps, such a union of playfulness and of terrible comment upon
the thwarted aspirations of a suffering soul as has this:--<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>I asked no other thing, 
No other was denied.
I offered Being for it;
The mighty merchant smiled.

Brazil? He twirled a button,
Without a glance my way:
'But, madam, is there nothing else
That we can show to-day?'
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

Since life seemed, to her, seldom to move along wholly simple and direct ways,
she delighted to accentuate the fact that out of apparent contradictions and
discords are wrought the subtlest harmonies:--<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>To learn the transport by the pain, 
As bend men learn the sun;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

and<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>Sufficient truth that we shall rise--
Deposed, at length, the grave-- 
To that new marriage, justified
Through Calvaries of Love;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

and<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>The lightning that preceded it
Struck no one but myself, 
But I would not exchange the bolt 
For all the rest of life.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

The expectation of finding in her work some quick, perverse, illuminating
comment upon eternal truths certainly keeps a reader's interest from flagging,
but passionate intensity and fine irony do not fully explain Emily Dickinson 's
significance. There is a third characteristic trait, a dauntless courage in
accepting life. Existence, to her, was a momentous experience, and she let no
promises of a future life deter her from feeling the throbs of this one. No
false comfort released her from dismay at present anguish. An energy of pain
and joy swept her soul, but did not leave any residue of bitterness or of sharp
innuendo against the ways of the Almighty. Grief was a faith, not a disaster.
She made no effort to smother the recollections of old companionship by that
species of spiritual death to which so many people consent. Her creed was
expressed in these stanzas:--<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>They say that 'time assuages,'-- 
     Time never did assuage;
An actual suffering strengthens, 
     As sinews do, with age.

Time is a test of trouble,
     But not a remedy.
If such it prove, it proves too 
     There was no malady.
     </pre>
     </blockquote>

<p>

The willingness to look with clear directness at the spectacle of life is
observable everywhere in her work. Passionate fortitude was hers, and this is
the greatest contribution her poetry makes to the reading world. It is not
expressed precisely in single poems, but rather is present in all, as key and
interpretation of her meditative scrutiny. Without elaborate philosophy, yet
with irresistible ways of expression, Emily Dickinson's poems have true lyric
appeal, because they make abstractions, such as love, hope, loneliness, death,
and immortality, seem near and intimate and faithful. She looked at existence
with a vision so exalted and secure that the reader is long dominated by that
very excess of spiritual conviction. A poet in the deeper mystic qualities of
feeling rather than in the external merit of precise rhymes and flawless art,
Emily Dickinson's place is among those whose gifts are<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>Too intrinsic for renown.
</pre>

This submerged ocean is themercury backing the sea's glass; this is the culet of a diamond which has forgirdle the earth's immeasurable seashores, and for table the moon's disk. Itsfacets intensify the radiance of moonlight on salt water.<p><p>That our vision shows us but one such nexus to the moon is a disadvantage thatmay be alleviated somewhat by the plan of the garden, which should have acentral path running due north to facilitate the enjoyment of the zenith orlunar noon, a path going eastwards to greet the rising moon, and a thirdtraveling westward toward its setting.<p><p>All dipping finally into the sea, these paths should be proportioned as was aCrusader's sword, the east- and west-going paths cut short, like the cross onthe hilt, the northern path long, like the sword blade. The pommel would givethe hint, dimensionally, for a fourth path, having at its tip the doorway intothe garden; it should have but a little gate.<p><p>A basin to hold the stars should be put where the four pathways meet. Theirdark foliage pitted by the Pleiades, or by wheeling Orion, with tiny sequins oflight, four magnolia trees, placed so that they do not overshadow it, may flankthe basin.<p><p>While the walks in a moonlight garden are best made of light-colored granite(marble, unless it be liberally clouded over with pink, is too white), the starbasin should be lined with malachite or black marble, or some other darksubstance, so that Betelgeuse or Aldebaran lost nothing in the reflecting. Forthis reason the water should be sunk, lest the winds ruffle it, below the rimof the platter. Yet it should not be set down so deep that a hand may not reachthe stars.<p><p>Since lotus buds in the moonlight open so quickly that it is possible to hearthe plop the petals make in sundering,--as if they kissed at parting,--sincethe yellow water lilies of the Euphrates or the dim Asian kinds blossom only atnight, it is a temptation, to some, to mix lilies in with the stars in thebasin. But it is better to limit oneself to the galaxy. For lilies, unlikeviolets, have no legendary association with the sea. White violets may bescattered lightly over the rocks, well above the inrush of spray at high tide.But lilies are landlubbers.<p><p>It is not known how souls are begotten. That they may grow on the humanmind--parasites of experience--gives life but a tame climax. That they are inreality begotten in mystic intercourse with a Divine Consonance,--that thosewho are, in the body, childless may yet be the foremost breeders of souls,--isa theory not without appeal; and as a breeding ground for souls a moonlightgarden may have its uses, particularly if it harbors a crooked acacia, whosetarnished, off-white blossoms may brush the moon with silver, may stir thesenses with exhalations so sweet, so faint, so fleeting, that only souls cancatch them.<p><p>A moon bow, though among the rarest is not the least brilliant of the diademsof night. Snaring within its triple arches humid cerulean, veiled rose,saffron, purple, lime-green smeared with maize, it echoes palely a rainbow'shardier chromatics. A moon bow is never so rare that it may not be hoped for;in rainy weather, with a full moon moving in puffs of light through a piebaldsky, a moonlight gardener may expect to see one.<p><p>It is wisest to let unserried waves of fringed hydrangeas break, whiter thanarctic snows, against the edges of all the granite paths, lines of moonflowers,their milky pendants brilliant as candelabra, linked with them as seventhwaves. Beyond the moonflowers stone pilasters must lift up feathery cascades ofwhite wistarias--some fifty or sixty vines spreading out into fans of ebullientfoam. White azaleas, and acacias, and oleanders must fringe the limits of thegarden, the flash of surf in the shelving bays beneath them always glitteringthrough their exquisite intricacies of branch and bough.<p><p>When in silver flocks the sea birds troop home across this silent, lovelypromontory, some sea eagle or migrant white owl may stay to rest in the acaciaboughs, or some deft osprey fish from the granite steps that dip into the sea,or a white, languid peacock may be cajoled to walk here. But if the moonlightgarden is to be kept, as it should be, primarily as a hatchery for souls, itshould be kept solitary.<p><p>None but sea voices should be heard by those who frequent this garden of themoon and sea; no sound but the hesitant sibilants of the waves, and the whisperof the sea winds.<p>Copyright 1936, Ethel Anderson.<p>						<!--DROPCAP-->													<!--INSERT TEXT UP TO													HERE--></blockquote>												<!-- end article --><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br>			<!--NAVIGATION BUTTONS--><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

	<font size=5>T</font>he fundamental question of statecraft has always been, What are a nation's

vital interests--those for which the nation will go to war? What considerations

of national interest prompted the Bush Administration to believe that the

United States had to wage war in the Persian Gulf? As U.S. policy evolved

during the pre-war crisis, three national-interest justifications emerged as

bases for it: the need to guarantee an uninterrupted flow of Middle East oil

(which entailed defending Saudi Arabia); the need to counter the threat to the

Middle East posed by Iraq's military arsenal, especially its chemical,

biological, and prospective nuclear weapons; and the need to ensure peace and

stability in the Middle East.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>The Oil Argument</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>L</font>AST fall in a campaign speech, George Bush said that the Gulf crisis was about

aggression, not oil. Clearly, aggression was a factor, but, as Bush himself

repeatedly stated, so was oil. Admittedly, oil is important--but not important

enough to justify the Gulf War. Several points need to be made about the oil

argument. First, given the centrality of the Arabian Peninsula's oil reserves,

a case can be made that no hostile power should be allowed to dominate the

region. The need to prevent an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia was, therefore, a

key consideration for Washington, and the Saudis would not have asked for U.S.

assistance unless they had reason to believe that an attack was imminent.

However, this threat could have been--and was--countered without war, through

deterrence, containment, and the economic embargo of Iraq. (Apparently this was

precisely the course of action recommended by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs

of Staff, General Colin Powell.) Moreover, such a strategy could have been

implemented with far fewer than the 200,000 U.S. soldiers initially deployed in

Operation Desert Shield. A limited and temporary U.S. air, naval, and ground

presence would have sufficed to dissuade the Iraqis from further aggression and

to buy time for Saudi Arabia and its regional allies to organize an all-Arab

defense of the desert kingdom.<p>



<p>



Second, the August, 1990, crisis was far different from the situation in 1980

when, in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, U.S. policy-makers

worried that Moscow could seize control of the Persian Gulf and blackmail the

West geopolitically. Nor was the Gulf crisis a replay of 1973, when OPEC tried

to use its monopoly power to extort political concessions from the West.

Interestingly, at that time the United States never seriously considered using

armed force to break OPEC. Whereas OPEC had a monopoly position, Iraq, even

after overrunning Kuwait, controlled a mere seven percent of current world oil

production--far too small a share to have enabled Baghdad to impose a

stranglehold on the world economy. Moreover, the oil argument rested on a shaky

economic foundation. Saddam Hussein's Iraq was no different from any other oil

producer: Iraq needed to sell oil, not withhold it from the market, because oil

was Baghdad's only significant revenue source. Like other producing nations,

Iraq also had every reason to avoid driving oil prices up to a point where

consumers would have had an incentive to switch to alternate energy sources.<p>



<p>



Third, granting Iraq's inability to control the world oil market, the United

States and other affected nations nevertheless were understandably mindful of

the distribution of oil wealth in the Middle East. As others have pointed out,

if Kuwait had been invaded by a less powerful or ambitious nation, the event

might have passed unnoticed. However, alarm bells go off when a nation like

Iraq, with regional geostrategic aspirations, expands its oil revenues through

conquest, because it is likely to use the additional income to augment its

military power. This is a valid concern, especially so with Saddam Hussein's

Iraq, but it is one that can be addressed diplomatically. In Iraq's case, the

embargo against oil exports deprived Baghdad of most of its income; it could

not afford to buy either new weapons systems or spare parts to maintain its

existing military force.<p>



<p>



Fourth, there was always the possibility that Saddam Hussein's Iraq (or some

other OPEC power in the future) could have chosen to behave in an economically

irrational fashion by using its oil resources to achieve political or

ideological objectives rather than wealth. Over time, of course, the

requirements of supply-and-demand equilibrium would force such a rogue oil

producer to return to an economically rational oil-pricing policy. In the

intervening period, however, the U.S. and world economies might suffer

unpleasant dislocations. But this simply illustrates a basic problem: the

Persian Gulf is an endemically turbulent region. Even now, after America's

victory, access to Persian Gulf oil remains precarious. One of the Gulf War's

key lessons is clear: rather than absorbing the costs of preparing for, and

perhaps fighting, future Middle Eastern wars, America would be better off

developing other energy sources and cutting its reliance on imported oil.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>The "Keep Saddam From Getting Nukes" Argument</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>A</font> SECOND national-interest justification for U.S. policy was the threat posed

by the prospect of an Iraq armed with nuclear (and biological and chemical)

weapons. The Bush Administration was slow to employ this rationale, although

its supporters were not. As early as last August conservative and

neoconservative war hawks such as Frank Gaffney, Jr., Henry Kissinger, Richard

Perle, A. M. Rosenthal, William Safire, and <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> claimed

that smashing Iraq's military potential and destroying its capacity to develop

nuclear weapons was America's overriding objective in the Gulf. Liberal

supporters of Bush's policy also embraced the contention that the potential

Iraqi nuclear threat to the United States was, as <I>The New Republic</I> put it, "the

real reason there needs to be war against Iraq." The Administration apparently

discovered the Iraqi nuclear threat when it read the results of a <I>New York

Times</I>/CBS poll last November which suggested that of all the reasons offered as

justification for fighting Iraq, the only one resonating with the American

public was the need to keep Saddam Hussein's finger off the nuclear trigger.

Within days Bush was warning that Iraq was only a few months away from

detonating a crude nuclear device and that the United States itself could be

imperiled.<p>



<p>



The notion that Iraq was a near-term nuclear threat was perhaps contrived to

undercut those who wanted to give economic sanctions an additional twelve to

eighteen months to work before war was considered. Before the war the expert

consensus was that Iraq was five to ten years away from acquiring an

operational nuclear force. Even then Iraq would have posed little direct threat

to the United States, because it would have taken far longer for Baghdad to

have developed the capability to deliver nuclear weapons intercontinentally.

(Moreover, the notion that Iraq would expose itself to certain destruction by

America's overwhelmingly superior nuclear arsenal--unquestionably the outcome

if Baghdad ever attacked the United States with nuclear weapons--is sheer

fantasy.) This is not to say, however, that the problem of nuclear

proliferation is a matter of indifference.<p>



<p>



Within the next thirty years Japan and Germany will almost certainly become

nuclear powers, as a necessary complement to their emerging great-power status.

A host of smaller nations also have the capability to become nuclear powers.

Some of these nations are potential aggressors (North Korea, Libya), others are

situated in already unstable areas (Egypt, Iran, South Africa), and still

others are involved in tense confrontations with neighboring states (Pakistan,

South Korea). Nevertheless, the spread of nuclear weapons need not in itself be

destabilizing. On the contrary, if both of a pair of nuclear-armed rivals have

invulnerable retaliatory forces, both will be deterred from using nuclear

weapons. Under such conditions nuclear weapons have no war-fighting utility,

because using them against an adversary ensures one's own destruction.

Moreover, under such conditions the risk of conventional war is also lowered,

because both sides understand the risks of escalation.<p>



<p>



Nuclear proliferation should nonetheless not be encouraged, and the

international community should attempt to curb the spread of

nuclear-weapons-related technology. But when proliferation does occur, the

proper response is to stabilize emerging regional nuclear balances through

arms-control regimes that promote the acquisition of invulnerable second-strike

retaliatory forces; to disseminate command-and-control technology to ensure

that nuclear weapons are not used inadvertently or accidentally; and to tutor

the new nuclear powers in security safeguards to protect against the theft or

unauthorized use of their nuclear weapons. It is extremely important not to

overreact to the emergence of new nuclear powers. It would be tragic if other

nations (India in relation to Pakistan, for example) used the Gulf War as a

precedent to justify preemptive military action against prospective nuclear

rivals. Even the prospect that an egregious government may acquire nuclear

weapons does not automatically justify a strike against its nuclear

facilities.<p>



<p>



Nuclear weapons incline their possessors to risk-averse rather than risk-taking

behavior. For example, in the 1960s many feared what would happen when China

became a nuclear power. Before China obtained nuclear weapons, its leaders

repeatedly said that among the great powers China alone could fight and win a

nuclear war, because with its huge population it could absorb the casualties

from such a conflict. Once China actually became a nuclear power, however, its

declaratory and strategic politics conformed to the more cautious practices of

the nuclear club's other members. Of course, the world is an unpredictable

place, and there is always the possibility, however remote, that nuclear

weapons could fall into the hands of a "crazy" regime. However, Israel in 1981

and the U.S. air campaign in 1991 demonstrated that such a regime could be

disarmed without incurring the political, diplomatic, and military risks (not

to mention the economic cost) of engaging in a major land war. Moreover, the

risk that the United States would ever have to contemplate such action in the

future could be reduced substantially by deploying a strategic defense

system.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>The Peace-and-Stability Argument</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE third national-interest justification for going to war was the need to

ensure peace and stability in the Middle East. Notwithstanding America's

brilliant military victory, the final verdict on the Gulf War has yet to be

rendered. As President Bush has stated, that verdict will turn on the war's

impact on the region's politics. The prospects for a favorable political and

diplomatic outcome are not good.<p>



<p>



First, there is the matter of Iraq. Who will govern if Saddam Hussein is

overthrown? Traditionally, Iraq's political culture has been marked by violence

and instability, and a happy democratic outcome is not likely. Would a

post-Saddam Hussein government adopt a less threatening foreign policy? It

would in the short run, because postwar reconstruction will absorb Iraqi

energies for some time. Eventually, however, Baghdad will reassert its

long-standing aspirations for regional predominance. Iraq's national

aspirations (including its designs on Kuwait) long pre-date Saddam Hussein, and

they will not disappear just because he does.<p>



<p>



Of course, there is the possibility that Iraq may break up. America's

determination to crush Iraq humiliated Saddam Hussein, thereby making his

ultimate downfall somewhat more possible. The terms of the permanent cease-fire

were also structured to further that goal. At the same time, the U.S. military

campaign weakened Iraq to the point where its dismemberment is a real

likelihood, notwithstanding the insurgents' defeat in what was surely only the

first round of Iraq's civil war. This civil war--which plunged the United

States into a moral and political quagmire--and the plight of the Kurdish and

Shiite rebels and refugees were foreseeable outcomes of Washington's Gulf

policy.<p>



<p>



The big-time use of military power is a blunt instrument, and when bludgeons

are used, the results are messy. Before the Gulf War some foreign-policy

analysts warned that a conflict would have long-term destabilizing effects:

Iran would emerge as the region's dominant power, and a vanquished Iraq would

be prone to internal strife and in danger of disintegrating completely. Since

its creation, after the First World War, Iraq has been a fragile entity, with

its Sunni Muslim elite dominating restless Shiites and Kurds. In the aftermath

of the Gulf War, Syria, Iran, and Turkey--each of which has irredentist claims

on Iraq--have encouraged and abetted turmoil there. Now Iraq faces the prospect

of continuing internal unrest and possible eventual Lebanonization. A power

vacuum there, should it occur, would bode ill for Middle Eastern stability, the

maintenance of which was the Administration's objective in the war.<p>



<p>



Washington's initial realpolitik inclination to stay out of Iraq's civil war

was prudent. But Bush was trapped by his own moralistic new-world-order

rhetoric, and, pressured from both political flanks, the Administration wobbled

into making an open-ended commitment to the Kurds. As a recent Senate Foreign

Relations Committee staff report said, "Unless the United States is prepared to

abandon the Iraqi people, it will be involved in the Iraqi quagmire for a long

time to come." But the Administration cannot be absolved of responsibility for

the horrific Iraqi civil war. If the United States had followed a realistic

policy from the beginning--by avoiding war--these tragic events almost

certainly would not have occurred.<p>



<p>



But the Administration refused to listen to the analysts who said that a war in

the Gulf would trigger upheaval of precisely this kind.

Moreover--inexcusably--Washington did virtually no thinking of its own about

the conflict's predictable consequences. As Robin Wright reported in the<I>Los

Angeles Times</I> on January 14 of this year, only on the eve of hostilities--when

the decision to go to war had already been made--did the Administration finally

set up a high-level interagency study group to think about the Gulf crisis's

end game.<p>



<p>



The Administration compounded its complicity by actively trying to galvanize

the Iraqi people into overthrowing Saddam Hussein. Washington was far more

culpable in its encouragement of the Iraqi rebels than in its role in Hungary

in 1956. Then it was merely the semi-official Radio Free Europe that arguably

helped to incite the anti-Soviet revolution. This time, on February 15, the

President of the United States himself explicitly encouraged Iraqis to revolt.

When the policy chickens finally came home to roost in Iraq, the Administration

engaged in the morally appalling spectacle of wringing its hands over the Kurds

and Shiites while simultaneously washing its hands of any responsibility for

their fate. This was worse than disingenuousness; it was prevarication.<p>



<p>



The Administration has been an innocent abroad in a region where problems are

intractable and politics are Byzantine. The United States has been manipulated

by regional powers--Saudi Arabia, Israel, Syria, Turkey, and Egypt--pursuing

their own agendas. There is a lesson in all of this that many conservatives and

some liberals have overlooked: the United States should avoid overseas

Wilsonian crusades. In some circles the war has produced the intoxicating

belief that American power is unchallenged and that Washington can lay down the

rules for behavior both among nations and within them. But Americans should

beware of the overweening ambition that is born of hubris. The world is not

infinitely malleable. The United States has seldom done well trying to

stage-manage the process of political change in other countries. It is the

people in those countries who pay the price when American experiments in

"nation-building" go awry. There are many problems in the world but few of them

have "Made in America" solutions.<p>



<p>



At this writing the Administration's postwar drive for peace in the region

looks stymied. The Palestinian issue appears as intractable as ever, and it

remains the key to achieving a broader Arab-Israeli accord. Washington wants

Israel to embrace the peace-for-land formula--returning the Golan Heights to

Syria and creating an independent Palestinian state. Syria and Saudi Arabia

will certainly not recognize Israel unless it makes these concessions. For

strategic and ideological reasons, to say nothing of indignation at the

Palestinians' pro-Iraq stance during the war, the Israelis are not likely to be

forthcoming. Failure to resolve the Palestinian question, whether by shuttle

diplomacy or by a U.S.-convened peace conference, would result in diminished

U.S. influence in the Arab world, demonstrating the insubstantiality of the

diplomatic capital that Washington accumulated during the Gulf War. Failure

could fuel tensions in the Arab world that could cause yet another Arab-Israeli

war.<p>



<p>



Wars invariably have unintended consequences for the victors--leaving them to

deal with unforeseen postwar political turmoil (like that in Iraq) and creating

pressures to assume new military commitments (like the expanded, permanent U.S.

military presence in the Gulf which Washington is projecting). In the final

analysis, wars are fought to win political victories, not battlefield

ones--something to which the Administration gave little thought before plunging

into the Gulf. Before going to war statesmen should be confident that their

nation will be better off diplomatically when the conflict ends than when it

began. But now that the Gulf War is over, Washington cannot make this claim.

Even strong backers of the Bush Administration's Gulf policy, like <I>The New

Republic</I>, concede the obvious: "There will be no 'new world order' in the

Middle East. Without Saddam there is merely, perhaps, the chance of less

chronic disorder" (italics added). More likely, the Middle East in the future

will be just as much prone to armed conflicts, rapacious dictators, upheaval,

and instability as it was before the war. Whatever influence America has to

shape events in the Middle East is a rapidly wasting asset. The Soviet Union,

Iran, and the countries of Western Europe have their own views about the

political and security arrangements that should be put in place in the region.

Moreover, Washington is likely to have little leverage over its Middle East

clients, notwithstanding America's wartime exertions on their behalf, on any

regional issues--including the Arab-Israeli problem and a postwar Gulf security

regime. These nations will be resistant to U.S. pressures because the matters

at stake in the Middle East are far more important to them than they are to the

United States.<p>



<p>



Clearly, bringing peace and stability to the region is a goal that is not and

never was within Washington's reach. Other than the dubious satisfaction of

liberating Kuwait and restoring its government--a corrupt, repressive, and

undemocratic regime that, to paraphrase Bismarck's comment about the Balkans,

was not worth the bones of a single American soldier--it is hard to see what

lasting gains the United States has secured from the Gulf War.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>The "New World Order" Argument</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>D</font>URING the national debate leading up to the war, the Bush Administration tried

vainly to articulate a coherent, cogent, and convincing rationale for risking

war with Iraq. The Administration's difficulty, which was widely commented on,

supports the supposition that the mainsprings of America's Gulf policy lay not

in the Middle East but elsewhere: in the American foreign-policy elite's values

and premises, which are encapsulated in the new-world-order concept. This

hypothesis can be tested quite easily. The Bush Administration advanced two

lines of argument to explain its policy. One framed the policy in traditional

national-interest terms. The other placed the Middle East crisis within the

context of Washington's new-world-order objectives. If the former reasons do

not hold up when examined, it can readily be inferred that the latter actually

drove U.S. policy.<p>



<p>



Those who have called the Gulf War the first worldwide crisis of the post-Cold

War era are wrong. U.S. foreign policy is still very much driven by Cold War

thinking--the same vision of world-order politics that has driven American

policy since the end of the Second World War. Rather than weighing its tangible

concerns in the crisis, the United States was dragged into the Gulf by the

deadweight of the Cold War's intellectual baggage. The Bush Administration's

reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was a Pavlovian response right out of the

Cold War. U.S. policy-makers did not stop to ask whether rote Cold War

responses were relevant in a world where the political, military, and economic

balance of forces was shifting dramatically.<p>



<p>



The new world order is the Bush Administration's response to the intellectual

crisis in U.S. foreign policy caused by the Cold War's end. Deprived of the

Cold War as a justification for active global military and diplomatic

engagement, U.S. policy-makers needed to come up with a substitute rationale

for globalism. But in this respect the transition from the Cold War to the new

world order was easy. With the Soviet menace receding, a new justification for

globalism magically appeared--summed up in the Administration's avowal that the

post-Cold War world is characterized by "uncertainty, instability, and danger."

According to Administration officials, in this dangerous and uncertain new

world diminishing Soviet power does not lessen the threat to American

interests. On the contrary, they say, the United States will be even less

secure in the post-Cold War world than it was in the post-Second World War era,

owing to anti-American regimes in the Third World, drug traffickers,

antidemocratic insurgents, terrorism, and the proliferation of weapons of mass

destruction to hostile states. Consequently, the Bush Administration says, the

United States must maintain the same military commitments (Europe, Japan, South

Korea, the Philippines, Latin American, Southwest Asia) and the same mix of

forces (though at a reduced level) that it maintained during the Cold

War--notwithstanding that these alliances and force structures were

specifically tailored to contain the Soviet Union. As Defense Secretary Dick

Cheney told the Senate Budget Committee in February of 1990, "America should

continue to anchor its strategy to the still-valid doctrines of flexible

response, forward defense [and] security alliances . . . . Even the

extraordinary events of 1989 do not mean that America should abandon this

strategic foundation." (One wonders just what would, in the Administration's

view, justify a fundamental shift away from globalism as the basis for

America's national strategy.) The Bush Administration's geopolitical response

to the Cold War's end was succinct: Read our lips--no new thinking.<p>



<p>



To replace the obsolete mission of containing the Soviet Union, American

internationalists have declared that the U.S. role in the post-Cold War world

is nothing less than preserving the "peace and stability of the world" in this

purportedly new, uncertain, and dangerous era. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait

became, for the Administration, "the first assault on the world we seek" and

the test case of whether the post-Cold War world would sink into anarchy or be

governed instead by "an international order--a common code of the rule of law

that promotes cooperation in place of conflict." For the new world order to

work, its architects say, the United States must oppose aggression everywhere

and appease it nowhere. Although the new world order is supposed to be defended

under the principle of collective security, U.S. leadership of the

international community is nevertheless seen as indispensable, because, as the

sole remaining superpower, the United States supposedly bears unique

responsibilities.<p>



<p>



There is in fact nothing new about the Bush Administration's new world order.

Its rhetoric and assumptions have a familiar ring. The same kind of thinking

led the United States into Vietnam. As the former Secretary of State Dean Rusk

stated in his memoirs, As I Saw It, the belief that America was responsible for

stopping aggression everywhere and upholding international law underlay U.S.

policy in Vietnam--another Wilsonian crusade fought primarily by the United

States (as the Gulf War was) in the name of collective security. True, the Gulf

War differed from Vietnam geopolitically, topographically, and in its outcome.

But in one crucial respect the two wars were identical: both were fought in

behalf of, as Bush put it, the "vital issues of principle" associated with

world-order politics. In neither instance did concrete U.S. national interests

necessitate fighting a war.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>Those Hoary "Lessons of the 1930s"</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>L</font>IKE the cold war version politics, Bush's new world order rests on a set of

interconnected premises about the nature of international stability, the

validity of the "1930s analogy," and the efficacy of collective security. These

assumptions cannot withstand close examination.<p>



<p>



To begin with, the new world order's goals are unattainable. War, aggression,

and instability are not exceptional events--they are inherent features of world

politics. Indeed, since 1945 there have been ten major interstate wars

(excluding America's wars, in Korea, Vietnam, and the Gulf), over forty various

other interstate conflicts (again excluding U.S. actions, in Guatemala,

Lebanon, Grenada, Libya, and Panama), some twenty wars of liberation from

occupation or colonial rule, and nearly sixty internal conflicts (civil wars

and struggles for autonomy or secession).<p>



<p>



The future does not promise to be more tranquil. George Bush notwithstanding,

the "day of the dictator" is not over. Many nations are ruled by repressive and

aggressive governments. Because nationalism is rampant in the Soviet Union,

East Central Europe, and the Third World, conflict is likely to be more

prevalent in coming years. Irredentist and ethnic strife could trigger wars in

these areas. The fact that the borders in these regions--largely drawn by the

First World War victors in East Central Europe and by the former colonial

powers in Africa and the Middle East--do not coincide with racial, religious,

and ethnic dividing lines increases the odds for turmoil: turmoil that some of

the participants might regard as entirely justified. Obviously, the United

States cannot be responsible for rectifying every violation of international

behavioral norms, or for punishing, or overthrowing, every evil ruler in the

world. The problem with world-order politics, however, is that it rests on

legal and moral notions that purportedly have universal applicability, and

provides no criteria for determining which overseas conflicts affect vital

American interests and which are of only peripheral concern to the United

States.<p>



<p>



From the outset of the Gulf crisis President Bush compared Saddam Hussein to

Adolf Hitler and equated the Iraqi threat with that posed by Nazi Germany in

the 1930s. This analogy was fanciful, though no doubt presented sincerely.

Saddam Hussein certainly is evil, but he is no Hitler. More important, Iraq was

not another Nazi Germany--as demonstrated by the very ease with which U.S.

forces vanquished it. By Third World standards pre-war Iraq was powerful,

though as the Iran-Iraq war had demonstrated, its offensive capabilities were

limited. But pre-war Iraq was not a world power, and with its limited

population and limited industrial-technological base, it had no prospect of

becoming one. Nazi Germany, on the other hand, was Europe's second most

populous nation (behind the Soviet Union), its most formidable military and

economic power, and a world leader in science and technology. As such, by

gaining control over all of Europe, Nazi Germany could have upended the global

balance of power and ultimately threatened the United States--something Iraq

was utterly incapable of doing.<p>



<p>



Still, Bush's invocation of the 1930s was understandable, because since the

Second World War, U.S. policymakers have viewed international relations through

the prism of Munich. The 1930s analogy rests on the assumption that

"aggression" must be resisted--not "appeased"--wherever it occurs, because it

will snowball unless firmly stopped. As President Bush put it, if the United

States had "not responded to this first provocation [Iraq's invasion of Kuwait]

with clarity of purpose, if we do not continue to demonstrate our

determination, it would be a signal to actual and potential despots around the

world." Many who supported the Administration's policy echoed Bush by arguing

that if the United States had not intervened to stop Saddam Hussein when it

did, it would have had to fight later, when Iraq had increased its strength

through conquest.<p>



<p>



Although deeply ingrained in the American world view, the 1930s analogy is

based on a false idea of how nations behave. As the political scientist Kenneth

Waltz, of the University of California, has pointed out, because nations want

to preserve their independence, they form alliances--"balance"--against

extremely powerful or very threatening regimes. Nations do not, except under

rare circumstances, "bandwagon"--appease or cast their lot with those who

threaten them. The balancing tendency is richly illustrated in European

history. The successive hegemonic bids of Charles V, Louis XIV, Napoleon, the

Kaiser, and Adolf Hitler were all frustrated by anti-hegemonic coalitions. In

his book <I>The Origins of Alliances</I>, Stephen M. Walt, of the University of

Chicago, used the pattern of Middle Eastern strategic alignments from 1955 to

1979 to test Waltz's balancing-bandwagoning hypotheses. Walt found that like

their European great-power counterparts, Middle Eastern nations almost always

balance against threatening neighbors.<p>



<p>



The findings of Middle East experts support these conclusions. As Dankwart

Rustow, a Middle East expert at the City University of New York, observed

several years ago,<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

While many Middle Eastern countries individually nurse expansionist or

hegemonic ambitions, all of them collectively, by their preference for the

weaker side and their readiness to shift alignments regardless of ideology,

offer strong support for the status quo . . . . the pattern of hostility,

interaction and maneuver thus has its self-balancing features.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



If the United States had refused to intervene (or sharply limited its military

involvement) in the Persian Gulf, it is a very good bet that Saudi Arabia,

Egypt, Syria, and probably Iran would have organized a defensive coalition

against Iraq. And though an Arab alliance with Israel was certainly unlikely,

the members of this anti-Iraq group would have winked at any strikes at Iraq's

nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons facilities that Israel made. Those in

Washington whose premise was "We must stop him now or else" got it wrong.

Balancing will occur regardless of what the United States does; nations resist

threatening powers because it is in their own interest to do so, not because

they are doing Washington a favor. The 1930s analogy completely misses the

point: the more threatening a state becomes to its neighbors, the more certain

that nation is to find that they have allied in opposition to its expansionist

goals.<p>



<p>



The Cold War's end has destroyed whatever shreds of plausibility the 1930s

analogy might have had. In a bipolar world it was easy to assume that there

were no geostrategic peripheries and that all U.S. security commitments abroad

were interdependent. Under such conditions it could at least be argued (and

frequently was) that credibility itself was a vital interest worth fighting for

and that America's credibility would be undermined by any failure of U.S.

resolve. But the passing of the Cold War and the emergence of multipolarity

mean that U.S. policy need no longer be driven by a morbid obsession with

establishing credibility in secondary regions in order to demonstrate the

reliability of U.S. security commitments in more vital areas.<p>



<p>



Finally, it should be noted that the 1930s analogy is deeply flawed

historically. Following the Second World War the myth took hold that throughout

the 1930s Britain had been blind to the growing menace of Nazi Germany and had

naively attempted to appease Hitler. Following the opening of the relevant

British archives this myth was exploded by such distinguished scholars as

Corelli Barnett, Brian Bond, Maurice Cowling, David Dilks, Norman Gibbs, Martin

Gilbert, Richard Gott, Keith Middlemas, and G. C. Peden. London was keenly

aware of the rising German threat, but its response was severely constrained by

Britain's economic weakness, the bitter political and class polarization of

British society, widespread domestic opposition to rearmament, the lingering

psychological impact of the First World War, the absence of reliable allies,

the lack of support from the Dominions, and the fact that Britain's worldwide

interests were also menaced by Japan and Italy. While preparing as best they

could for war, British policy-makers were determined to exhaust every

diplomatic avenue, because they believed--correctly, as it turned out--that

another world war would be disastrous for Britain and for Europe.<p>



<p>



Britain refrained from going to war in 1938 because it believed, correctly,

that it and France lacked the military capability to prevent Germany from

overrunning Czechoslovakia and because, up to November of 1938, it still had

reason to believe that its vital security interests in Western Europe could be

maintained through diplomacy and deterrence. When, between November of 1938

(the Kristallnacht pogrom) and March of 1939 (the German occupation of Prague),

it became clear that Germany was seeking European hegemony rather than only

rectification of the Versailles Treaty, a domestically united Britain and

empire moved to resist Berlin. Those who think that Britain waited too long to

act should remember that history turns on narrow margins. If Germany had been

checked in 1940, our collective memory of the 1930s (and America's pre-war

"isolationism") would be quite different. In this regard it is worth recalling

that many German generals were at least as surprised as their Anglo-French

counterparts by their victory in the Battle of France.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>An Overlooked Lesson of the 1930s</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>B</font>UT the second world war might never have happened, and Hitler might never have

come to power, if the victorious First World War Allies had abstained from

imposing a humiliating, one-sided peace settlement on Germany. By the 1930s the

British realized that the Versailles Treaty was poisoning European politics,

and Berlin's demands--the Rhineland, Austria, the Sudetenland, and the Polish

Corridor--were generally perceived in both England and Germany to be just.<p>



<p>



This illustrates a diplomatic conundrum deeply imbedded in world politics.

There is no clear rule that tells statesmen when necessary diplomatic

adjustment becomes dangerous appeasement, but any attempt to establish world

order must come to grips with the tension between those states that wish to

maintain the international status quo and those that wish to change it.<p>



<p>



Because the international system has some of the rudimentary elements of a

society (common norms, values, and institutions), states aspire to a just

order. However, that is not their overriding objective, and indeed in an

anarchic world--lacking a central authority to make and enforce rules--it

cannot be. Because world politics is anarchic and competitive, international

mechanisms for reconciling stability with the need for change are poorly

developed. When diplomacy fails to adjust an unacceptable status quo, an

aggrieved state often uses or threatens to use force, which remains the ultima

ratio in world politics. Nations that seek change in this fashion are

considered aggressors by the status-quo powers. Yet it is historically

commonplace for states to use military power to further their national

objectives and increase their strength at the expense of their weaker

neighbors. America's war against Mexico in 1846, which secured Texas and

California for the United States, is a good example.<p>



<p>



The Persian Gulf crisis therefore actually illustrates a typical pattern in

international relations. Saddam Hussein may have been disingenuous in embracing

the cause of Palestinians and disadvantaged Arabs, but his policy resonated

among Arabs who resent Western dominance and who saw the pre-war Middle East

status quo as unacceptable. These kinds of problems will abound in world

politics regardless of how the Persian Gulf crisis turns out. No "world order"

that fails to provide a means for resolving such issues peacefully is worthy of

the name. But it is the very difficulty of finding pacific answers to

contentious problems that makes world order a perennially elusive goal. At the

same time, as Waltz has noted, a world-order policy contains two dangers to

which the United States must not succumb. First, because "justice" cannot be

objectively defined in world politics, America is often tempted to equate its

policy preferences with the just solution to a problem. Second, it is easy to

forget that in a world teeming with dissension and controversy among nations

ending strife "would require as much wisdom as power," and in U.S. diplomacy,

wisdom is a scarce commodity.<p>



<p>



The belief that collective security can work pervades new-world-order thinking.

The Gulf War has sparked speculation that a multilateral institution like the

United Nations will play an important role in maintaining peace and stability

in the post-Cold War world. However, although the UN played a key role in

legitimating the anti-Iraq coalition, it would be a mistake to read too much

into this.<p>



<p>



The UN was structured by the Second World War Grand Alliance so that it could

intervene effectively only when the interests of the Security Council's five

permanent members coincided. As it happened, in the Gulf crisis the Big Five's

interests did overlap. Nevertheless, although Britain, France, the Soviet

Union, and China backed America's anti-Iraq coalition, each did so for

national-interest reasons that had little, if anything, to do with Saddam

Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. This convergence of great-power interests was

fortuitous and is unlikely to be repeated often in the future. The Gulf War

certainly did not establish a new world-community consensus about an

international code of conduct or a means of enforcing one.<p>



<p>



In fact, the description of the Gulf crisis as a "collective security"

enterprise shows how the definition of that term has grown vaguer during the

post-Second World War era. Americans have always viewed traditional alliances

with some distaste. Collective security, however, has been seen as something

noble and pristine. Accordingly, U.S. policy-makers have learned to describe

all U.S.-led alliances (including NATO) as collective-security instruments.

Washington has believed that U.S. interventions abroad derive legitimacy from

being conducted under the collective-security rubric. President Bush himself

confirmed that in the Gulf the UN was merely a flag of convenience for what was

essentially an American war. As he said, if the UN had refused to back U.S.

policy, "I might have said, To hell with them, it's right and wrong, it's good

and evil; he [Saddam Hussein] is evil, our cause is right, and--without the

United Nations--sent a considerable force to help." Collective security is a

rhetorical smokescreen obscuring the fact that the United States bears a

disproportionate burden when it comes to defending the interests it shares with

other nations.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=5>T</font>HE belief that collective security can work is alluring, but given the nature

of the international political system, it is chimerical. For collective

security to work, all states must view themselves as members of a single

community with an overriding interest in maintaining world order. But whereas

states favor order and justice in the abstract, they frequently disagree about

what these concepts mean when they are applied to concrete situations.

Moreover, a collective-security system requires that nations surrender their

freedom to define their national interests pragmatically, because it rests on

the premise that aggression anywhere is always equally threatening to all

nations. Consequently, adherence to collective-security principles can actually

undermine a nation's vital interests and divert policy-makers' attention from

more serious long-term threats to international security. The 1930s provide an

example: by supporting League of Nations sanctions against Italy for its

invasion of Ethiopia (an event that had no direct impact on the balance of

power in Europe or on important Anglo-French interests), London and Paris

pushed Rome out of the anti-German Stresa Front that had coalesced in early

1935. The loss of Italy as an ally against Hitler weakened the Anglo-French

strategic position in Europe and strengthened the German one.<p>



<p>



Collective security's requirements run counter to the imperatives of

international politics: in a competitive realm states seek to maximize their

autonomy; there is no automatic harmony of interests; each state's survival and

success is ultimately a matter of self-help As Inis Claude has written,

traditional statecraft "does not posit a seamless web of international peace

and order, nor assume as self-evident the proposition that every state has a

stake in preventing war or suppressing aggression wherever it may occur."

Although there may be occasions when U.S. participation in multilateral efforts

is justifiable, Washington should never cede to others its power to determine

when U.S. military action abroad is called for.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>The Dangerous Precedent Set by the Gulf War</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE United States fought and won the Gulf War, but it must break its habit of

fighting wars where its national interests are not involved. Such wars may be

just--and the war against the brutal Saddam Hussein met the criteria for a just

war--but by definition they are not necessary. And unnecessary wars are seldom

wise ones.<p>



<p>



Some analysts have argued that the Gulf War will not be a model for future U.S.

global strategy. Yet in coming years America may be even more actively engaged

abroad than it was during the forty-five years from the Second World War to the

outbreak of the Gulf crisis. Geopolitically, the Cold War's end has removed an

important constraint on U.S. military intervention, because there is no longer

much risk that a regional conflict will escalate into a full-scale superpower

conflict. Ideologically, moreover, new-world-order interventions may have

somewhat broader domestic appeal than the old-style Cold War kind. The old Cold

War liberal-conservative split over the propriety of U.S. intervention against

Communist or Marxist regimes could be transcended on both the left and the

neoconservative right by a resuscitated "anti-fascism" that would commit the

United States to overthrowing tyrannical, totalitarian, well-armed nations that

are unwilling to play by West-mandated rules when it comes to world politics or

to their own internal political structures. Indeed, the new world order--which

is based, according to Bush, on the need for "fighting aggression and

preserving the sovereignty of nations"--is even more all-encompassing than the

Cold War version of world-order politics, which merely sought to contain (or

roll back) communism and Marxism-Leninism.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>The Boer War Analogy</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>N</font>EVERTHELESS, the new world order is not a basis for a sustainable post-Cold

War U.S. foreign policy, not least because there is no consensus for post-Cold

War globalism. Support for the Administration's Gulf policy was largely after

the fact. On the eve of hostilities Americans were evenly divided about the

advisability of using force against Iraq. And as a postwar Newsweek poll

showed, notwithstanding the Gulf triumph an overwhelming majority of Americans

believe that the United States should not be more willing in the future to use

military power to solve international problems.<p>



<p>



Some have suggested that the Gulf War has revived the historical debate between

internationalists and isolationists. But the alternative to the kind of

internationalism embodied in the new world order is not isolationism but

national-interest realism--a concept that, as Hans Morgenthau said, should, by

putting American interests first, save the United States from both "moral

excess and political folly." Realism's essence is that statesmen must be

governed by what Max Weber called the ethic of responsibility: policies must be

judged by their consequences, not by their intentions.<p>



<p>



President Bush nicely illustrated the difference between world-order politics

and realism when he told David Frost that no price is too high to achieve the

new world order. But every realist knows that the means and ends of foreign

policy must be proportionate; the interests at stake must be balanced against

the consequences of pursuing them. Notwithstanding the Administration's

grandiose rhetoric, the United States cannot afford to be a geopolitical Don

Quixote, righting the world's wrongs. This is something that American

internationalists seem not to understand. On the contrary America's triumph in

the Gulf has caused them wildly to exaggerate U.S. power in world politics. In

this sense the Gulf War poses the same question for the United States that the

Boer War (1899-1902) raised for England: Does it confirm global preeminence or

mask an ongoing decline in relation to emerging great powers?<p>



<p>



The British Empire in 1900 sprawled across the globe and seemed to be at the

apogee of power. Most Britons were optimistic about the nation's future, and

there was even hope for a new world order based, in Zara Steiner's words, on

"the vision of arbitration, international law and perpetual peace." In

retrospect, we know that Britain's world dominance was an illusion and that the

First World War was just around the corner. Britain was already suffering from

what Paul Kennedy calls "imperial overstretch"--involving a gap between

strategic commitments and the willingness or ability to pay for them--and its

economic strength was eroding in relation to that of the United States and

Germany.<p>



<p>



Some British leaders, notably Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain, recognized

the predicament and sought, unsuccessfully, to restructure Britain's world

role. The Boer War did cause some changes in Britain's diplomatic policy, and

also led to much-needed military reforms. But after all, Britain won the war,

and because no major setback dramatized the increasing precariousness of the

country's world position, the underlying problems of strategic overextension

and structural economic weakness went fundamentally untreated. This ultimately

led to Britain's strategic nightmares of the 1930s and its rapid eclipse after

the Second World War.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>The Revivalists Get It Wrong</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>U</font>.S. revivalists--those who believe that America is resurgent after the Gulf

War and who reject the thesis that American power has declined from a peak that

occurred at the end of the Second World War--have misperceived America's

geopolitical situation as badly as turn-of-the-century optimists misperceived

Britain's. Addicted to America's post-1945 global leadership role, they have

constructed a number of clever but unconvincing arguments to show that

geopolitical primacy and the world-wide military commitments that go with it do

not contribute to the relative decline of U.S. power. At first they contended

that rather than America's having become weaker since the end of the Second

World War, other nations have gotten stronger--but that is precisely what

relative decline is all about. Then revivalists argued that decline was an

illusion because America was never "hegemonic"--but since power in world

politics is always relative, not absolute, not even the strongest powers get

their way all the time. Revivalists also like to point out that most of

America's relative economic decline occurred from 1945 to 1973, that America's

post-1945 economic predominance was exaggerated by the "Second World War

effect," and that America's present share of world product approximates its

"normal" (1938) share (about 25 percent). Although this is true as far as it

goes, it overlooks the fact that Washington's core global commitments (Western

Europe, Japan, South Korea) were assumed when U.S. power was at its zenith, in

the late 1940s and early 1950s, when America was responsible for half the

world's manufacturing output. Moreover, beginning in the 1980s U.S. strategic

obligations actually expanded (notably in the Persian Gulf), even though

America's relative economic power had already contracted.<p>



<p>



The latest revivalist argument holds that the United States can easily afford

both an ambitious international-security role and extensive social spending,

because defense spending's share of the GNP is declining. It is true that

defense spending is consuming a smaller share of America's GNP, but this misses

two key points.<p>



<p>



First, the United States has consistently invested a far greater share of its

GNP in defense than have economic powerhouses like Germany and Japan (and,

unsurprisingly, there is a strong correlation between low defense spending and

high national-productivity gains). And second, the cumulative effect of

investing resources in defense rather than in the more productive civilian

sector has damaged the U.S. economy. Those who believe that the United States

can, as Joseph S. Nye, Jr., has said, afford both domestic welfare and

international security, fail to acknowledge the tremendous increase in the

overall burdens on the American economy since 1938, the baseline year. Defense

spending was then 1.5 percent of GNP; today it is 5.5 percent. Domestic

spending was then only 5.4 percent of GNP; today it is 14.3 percent.

Revivalists suggest that Americans are undertaxed and should pay more to

preserve global U.S. commitments. But total federal, state, and local receipts

in 1989 amounted to 30.3 percent of GNP, as against 16 percent in 1939.<p>



<p>



Revivalists have turned "decline" into an epithet, and they see the Gulf War as

a confirmation of their triumph over the so-called "declinists." But

revivalists have failed to demonstrate that America enjoys a special exemption

from history. The United States faces the same dilemma that confronted earlier

great powers: the dominant world role is made possible by a thriving economy,

but as the costs of international dominance rise, an increasing share of

national resources must be invested in maintaining world-power status rather

than in economically productive endeavors. The paradoxical effect is that the

pursuit of global primacy undermines the economic foundation upon which primacy

rests.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>The Fleeting "Unipolar Moment"</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>A</font>MERICAN internationalists need to rethink the definition of superpower status

in the post-Cold War world. They should begin by remembering that at the turn

of the century the struggle for world economic leadership--and hence

geopolitical leadership--was, in the words of the military historian Corelli

Barnett, largely "lost in the school yards and quadrangles of Britain." Unless

U.S. imperial overstretch is acknowledged and corrected, the United States may

someday soon find that it has become a Potemkin village superpower--with a

facade of military strength concealing a core of economic weakness. The Persian

Gulf has shown that the transformation may already be occurring. After all,

real superpowers do not have to beg their allies to finance their overseas

military expeditions.<p>



<p>



Nevertheless, revivalists claim that the United States is "bound to lead" in

"organizing collective action," because if it does not, "no one else will." The

Gulf War, they say, proves that the world is not multipolar, because Germany

and Japan have been revealed as "one-dimensional" superpowers (that is,

economic superpowers only). But this "unipolarism" is based on a flawed

revivalist definition that confers superpower status only on nations with

overseas military commitments. The real measure of superpower status is a

nation's combined score on size of population and territory, resource

endowment, economic and technological capability, military strength, and

political stability and competence. By this standard the world is, or soon will

be, fully multipolar, with Germany and Japan joining the United States and the

Soviet Union (or Russia) as great powers.<p>



<p>



When all is said and done, revivalists deny multipolarity's nascent reality

simply because they find distasteful its implications: diminished U.S.

influence (by definition, the only superpower in a unipolar world carries more

weight than one great power among several in a multipolar world) and the risk

that the new great powers might follow independent foreign policies, form rival

trade blocs, or act "irresponsibly." Revivalists think that the United States

can "contain" Germany and Japan while simultaneously using its military power

to extract economic concessions from U.S. allies--notwithstanding that this

tactic has never proved successful. It didn't stop Germany's <I>Ostpolitik</I>, which

began in the 1960s; restrict Western European trade with the Soviet Union and

Eastern Europe during the Cold War; force Japan to open its markets; or prevent

the recent GATT talks from collapsing owing to European intransigence. Now that

the Cold War is over, other nations will be even less willing to pay an

economic price for U.S. military protection, because American security

guarantees are far less important.<p>



<p>



The foreign-policy establishment's belief that America is "bound to lead"

creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. As long as other nations believe that the

United States will do the hard work of defending their interests, they are

tempted to sit back and let it do so. The absence of Germany and Japan from the

Gulf did not mean that the world is not (or is not rapidly becoming)

multipolar; it simply showed that those countries are playing the world

political game more ably than the United States. The logic of a U.S.

world-order policy is clear: other nations get rich by investing their

resources in economically productive activities, but Americans get to risk

death and impoverishment protecting other nations' interests. In this sense

American "leadership" in the Persian Gulf crisis is a damning indictment of the

foreign-policy establishment's failure to adjust to new international

realities, and it shows just how far present-day revivalists have strayed from

America's postwar realist tradition. After all, the long-term goal of men like

George Marshall and George Kennan (and other realists, such as Dwight

Eisenhower, Robert Taft, and Walter Lippmann) was to restore a functioning

multipolar balance of power so that the United States could free itself from

its crushing global responsibilities by devolving them to other great and

regional powers.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>A Balancer Strategy</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>I</font>RONICALLY, the inevitable backlash against America's proclamation of the

"unipolar moment" will hasten the final transformation of the international

system to multipolarity. President Bush may now, after the Gulf War, believe

that the United States "has a new credibility and that what we say goes," but

other nations get very nervous when they hear such talk. With the Soviet Union

on the sidelines geopolitically, other nations will see a unipolar America as

the main threat to their autonomy and interests. As the elder statesman Paul

Nitze has pointed out, the new world order--together with the unipolar notion

from which it is derived--is harmful to American interests, because it will

cause other nations to direct their balancing behavior against the United

States. This should not be a surprise. Since the modern state system emerged,

unipolarity has never been more than momentary; when it seems to be imminent,

nations typically combine to check the power that is striving for predominance.

In world politics, in other words, unipolar moments never last. In the

aftermath of the Gulf crisis fear is already widespread in the Soviet Union,

Europe, Japan, and the Third World that America is now excessively powerful.

And in Germany and Japan serious national debates have begun about the need for

those nations to assume their world responsibilities fully and to acquire such

instruments of national power as will put them on an equal footing with the

United States.<p>



<p>



World politics is never "normal." Unwanted or unanticipated events--war,

aggression, crisis, and instability--are facts of international life. The issue

is how the United States should react to such events. In a balancing world,

modesty in actions and aspirations should be America's foreign-policy

watchword. Because few external events pose an immediate danger to the United

States, it can usually afford to react deliberately to events--to wait and see

if a potential threat becomes a real one. Therefore, in the post-Cold War

world, instead of being the world's policeman the United States should strive

to play the balancer's role--encouraging the formation of anti-hegemonic

coalitions, supporting them financially (which means that<p>



Washington must first clean up its fiscal mess), assisting them logistically

(for example, by transporting an ally's troops to a hot spot), but only rarely

providing them with direct military aid (and then for the most part limiting it

to air and naval support).<p>



<p>



A balancer strategy would turn on a simple truth: other nations have at least

as much interest in secure sea lanes, economic stability access to raw

materials, and regional stability as does the United States--and often more.

The less the United States does militarily, and the less others expect it to

do, the more other nations will do to help themselves. Thus a balancer

strategy--the foundation of Britain's successful eighteenth-and

nineteenth-century diplomacy--aims at burden-shifting, not burden-sharing; that

is, at forcing others to take the primary responsibility for defending common

interests. Cardinal Richelieu, the great French statesman, pointed out to Louis

XIII the inherent advantages of the balancer's role: "A singular prudence" had

enabled Richelieu, acting on the King's behalf, "to occupy the forces of the

enemies of your state by those of your allies, putting your hand to your purse

rather than your arms, and entering into open warfare only when your allies

could no longer subsist alone." The Germans and Japanese clearly understand

what Richelieu was talking about, even if Washington does not.<p>



<p>



America is not bound to lead a new world order. American internationalists have

never understood that because of the interlocking factors of geography, nuclear

weapons, and still-impressive great-power capabilities, the United States has

choices that other nations lack. Since the end of the Second World War, most

recently in the Gulf, the United States has chosen to exaggerate minor threats

to its security (the 1930s analogy) and to equate its safety with the

maintenance of world order. Such a policy is the prerogative of an extremely

powerful nation. But this kind of foreign policy has real costs, and relative

decline means that America's margin for error has narrowed. Nevertheless, U.S.

foreign policy has remained wedded to outdated, faulty assumptions about the

nature of international relations. The real issue facing the U.S.

foreign-policy community, is this: Is the Persian Gulf crisis the Cold War's

final installment, or will Washington continue to be guided by the mythology of

an earlier era? Before American policy can adjust to a changing world, however,

American policy-makers need to adjust the way they think about world 

politics. The Gulf crisis is proof that old ways of thinking die hard.<p>

<h1>Oil and Turmoil</h1>

<pre>

<font size=5>O</font>n June 24, 1996, a truck bomb

exploded just outside a military housing complex in Dhahran, Saudia Arabia,

killing 19 Americans and injuring hundreds more. Though no group has claimed

responsibility for the bombing, and the F.B.I. has not yet identified any

suspects, the incident clearly conveys resentment of the American military

presence in the region. President Clinton has vowed not to be bullied by such

terrorism into decreasing the U.S. military involvement in a country that, as

the world's leading oil-exporter, is vital to Western economic interests. <p>



<p>



The bombing does raise familiar questions, however, about America's 

conflict-ridden relationship with the Middle East.  Several <I>Atlantic</I> 

contributors have turned their attention to the issue in recent years.  In 

the wake of the Gulf War, the political scientist Christopher Layne 

explained <A HREF="Layne.htm">"Why the Gulf War Was Not in the National 

Interest"</A> (July, 1991), arguing that blunt military coercion by an 

external power such as the United States can never adequately resolve the 

subtle complexities of the Persian Gulf's political conflicts: <p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

The Administration has been an innocent abroad in a region where problems are

intractable and politics are Byzantine. The United States has been manipulated

by regional powers -- Saudi Arabia, Israel, Syria, Turkey, and Egypt --

pursuing their own agendas . . . . Americans should beware of the overweening

ambition that is born of hubris. The world is not infinitely malleable. The

United States has seldom done well trying to stage-manage the process of

political change in other countries. It is the people in those countries who

pay the price when American experiments in "nation-building" go awry. There are

many problems in the world but few of them have "Made in America" solutions.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



Two years later, in <A 

HREF="../../../election/connection/foreign/Miredf.htm">"The Persian Gulf: 

Still Mired"</A> (June, 1993) the political scientist Alan Tonelson 

similarly argued that the United States should extricate itself as soon as 

possible from Gulf politics.  The region, he asserted, is vehemently 

anti-Western and hopelessly unstable.  If access to oil is the primary 

incentive for our entanglement there, then we need to push harder for 

energy alternatives:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

To be sure, the Gulf states resemble real countries. They have heads of state,

armies, and postage stamps. They send ambassadors abroad. Underneath, however,

they are something else entirely: some are legal-political fictions, some

family corporations in which the restive immigrant employees greatly outnumber

the indigenous owners, others "tribes with flags." All are under constant

assault by centrifugal forces ranging from ethnic and religious tensions to

Islamic fundamentalism to pan-Arabism. For many regimes, making scapegoats of

foreigners and infidels is the only hope of survival. In other words, the Gulf

countries are either terminally insecure or irremediably bellicose.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



Robert Kaplan's <A HREF="Kaplan.htm">"Tales From the Bazaar"</A> (August, 1992) takes a different

approach to exploring U.S.-Arab relations. He focuses on the Americans who are,

have been, or will in the future be prominently involved in diplomatic

relations with Arab nations. Kaplan points out that U.S. Middle East

specialists are generally considered to be among the most talented members of

the State Department. "These people," he explains, "are a self-assured breed,

for whom the word 'Arabist' implies a tight-knit fraternity within the

diplomatic corps, united by their ability to speak a 'superhard' language and

by a vivid, common experience abroad." Concerned observers, like foreign-policy

expert Peter Rodman, however, worry that the very "breadth, depth, and texture

of the Arabists' knowledge of the Arab world may work to immobilize their

analytical thinking about it." Enamored of the exotic Arab world, Kaplan points

out, the Arabists may, with disastrous consequences, sometimes fail to grasp or

to acknowledge the grim realities of Gulf region politics. He does suggest,

however, that a rising younger generation of Middle East specialists seems

better equipped to address the complexities of the region's problems. <p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<p>



Can expert U.S. statesmanship surmount this region's instability and hostility?

Does a forceful military presence help the situation or hurt it? Should we

focus our resources and efforts more heavily on maintaining favorable relations

with oil-rich Arab governments, or on developing alternative sources of energy?

These perennial questions, freshly raised by the Dhahran bombing, are likely to

persist far into the future.<p>





For more on the search for alternative energy sources, see <A 

HREF="../../../issues/96apr/oil/oil.htm">"Mideast Oil 

Forever?"</A> by Joseph J. Romm and Charles B. Curtis (April, 1996).<p>

	<font size=5>F</font>or Jack McCreary, it was a moment of sweet satisfaction. A self-described

"child of the sixties," who had spent nearly two decades of his life in the

Arab world, McCreary was the U.S. embassy's press and culture officer in Iraq

in January of 1988, when the doors of the new American Cultural Center, on

Mansour Street in Baghdad, opened for the first time. At last, McCreary

thought, there was one place under Saddam Hussein's rule where ordinary Iraqis

and Americans could talk to each other in the same room. "The great thing about

living for long stretches in an awful country," McCreary said during an evening

I spent with him and his wife, Carol, at their home in Virginia, "is the

smallest victory, no matter how pathetic and inconsequential, gives you an

incredibly big boost."<p>



<p>



Life in Baghdad for the McCrearys and their young daughters, Kate and Joanna,

was made up of a number of such boosts. If anyone can squeeze a little water

from an ugly regime's monolithic stone, it is McCreary.<p>



<p>



After graduating from the University of California at Berkeley in 1968,

McCreary entered the Peace Corps, serving in Marrakech, Morocco, where he and

Carol met and were married. At the American University of Cairo, McCreary

perfected his Arabic. He then joined the U.S. Foreign Service, working as a

political officer at American embassies in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. In

Yemen, where I first met him, McCreary was becoming frustrated. Doing his job

properly, he felt, ought to mean immersing himself in Arabic with Arabs. "I

still marvel at the physical beauty of Arabic script. I'm shocked at people who

come to Arab countries and can't read the signs." But Yemen, like Qatar and

Saudi Arabia, was politically closed and sterile. Embassy officers were denied

regular, official contact with Yemenis. McCreary, who has a "4" rating in

Arabic, on a Foreign Service test scale of 5--meaning he speaks and reads

Arabic fluently--was meeting nobody except other diplomats. So he gave up the

job of political officer in order to run the embassy's press and culture

division. As far as his career was concerned, this was an unorthodox move. But

McCreary's life changed. "Suddenly I was with Yemenis all the time."<p>



<p>



Hume Horan, a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia and Sudan, observes, "It's the

embassy cultural officers who get the real internist's-eye view of a difficult

country. They have fewer restrictions placed on their movements. Since Arab

writers and artists are in a terrible financial situation and nobody cares

about their work, they come cheap: for the price of a meal and a bit of

appreciation they'll pour their souls out to you, providing the kind of

psychological clues to the workings of a system that a political officer will

never get from his Foreign Ministry contacts."<p>



<p>



In the summer of 1987, after finishing his assignment in Yemen, McCreary was

posted to Iraq. "On a strictly political level, nothing was happening,"

McCreary explained. "The embassy people knew nobody at the palace. We had no

access to the Baath Party. We'd invite Iraqis to receptions and they were too

frightened to show up. For us to claim we knew Baghdad would have been like a

Third World diplomat claiming to know Washington because there was one desk

officer at the State Department who returned his phone calls. But on the

cultural level in Iraq there was tremendous hope."<p>



<p>



Western secular culture was a bone that Saddam tossed to his affluent urban

subjects. Among other things, Baghdad was the lone Arab capital offering

classical piano and violin recitals and a degree program in European music.

McCreary's daughters took ballet lessons at an Iraqi government school.

McCreary became involved in a jazz club, Al-Ghareeb ("The Stranger"), in

downtown Baghdad, where he played the saxophone and Joseph Wilson, the

embassy's deputy chief of mission, sang, while McCreary's daughter Kate--along

with a crowd of Iraqi artists--made charcoal sketches of the performances. "It

was a marvelous place: jazz at night, me playing, Kate and the Iraqis drawing

away. From the point of view of my job, the Iraqis' interest in classical music

and jazz was certainly to be encouraged."<p>



<p>



The jazz club and his daughters' ballet lessons bought McCreary and his wife

rare entrees to the homes of numerous Iraqi families. "It was an artsy crowd of

ancient regime types and politically neutered intellectuals. Carol and I worked

constantly to give these people a sense of American values, to demonstrate how

free people think and behave: to show them it was possible. But they were

cowed. The big crisis in one family was the teenage daughter, whose beauty had

attracted one of Saddam's Takriti goons." (Takrit is Saddam Hussein's

birthplace, and that of many of his closest associates.)<p>



<p>



The United States Information Agency helped arrange for an American singer,

Billy Stephens, to give a concert in Baghdad. Stephens sang "We Shall Overcome"

and John Lennon's "Imagine." But when the singer asked the crowd of

English-speaking Iraqis to join in, there was silence. "Nobody dared," Carol

McCreary remembered.<p>



<p>



"But there was such hope, things really were getting better," Carol went on.

She described the lifting of internal travel restrictions after the Iran-Iraq

War was over, and the end of rationing. The American diplomatic community in

Baghdad assumed that there was a thin wedge of opportunity it could exploit,

especially after the revolution in Romania. Maybe it could happen here. The

diplomats all knew it wasn't much of a hope, but it was enough to keep them

going.<p>



<p>



Jack McCreary said, "Of course, considering all that has happened, this must

sound silly to you. I'm embarrassed to talk about it. They were building

chemical and nuclear weapons while they let a few diplomats open a library and

play in a jazz club. It all seems so stupid and misguided."<p>



<p>

<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE McCrearys, whom a right-wing observer might be tempted to ridicule as

"liberal, multicultural, Peace Corps types," have in fact tested a canon of

neoconservative interventionism--"the export of democracy"--on a deeply

personal level under the worst possible conditions, and have the emotional

scars to prove it. "The Arab world can be a nasty place," says a key State

Department official currently engaged in Middle East diplomacy. "But the

Arabist is someone who doesn't have the luxury to theorize from the sidelines.

He must actually live there and work solo with this intractable reality."<p>



<p>



McCreary and his colleagues are, of course, aware that "Arabist" is among the

most loaded words in America's political lexicon. In the Middle Ages an Arabist

was a physician who had studied Arab medicine, which was then more advanced

than the kind practiced in Europe. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth

centuries an Arabist was a student of the language, history, and culture. With

the birth of Israel, in 1947, the word gained another meaning. "It became a

pejorative for 'he who intellectually sleeps with Arabs,"' said Richard Murphy,

a former assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs, during a recent

interview. Murphy's wife, Anne, nodded sadly. "If you call yourself an

Arabist," she said, "people may think you're anti-Semitic."<p>



<p>



Along with that suspicion come suspicions of "clientitis" and elitism. I was

told a story about one U.S. diplomat's wife in Cairo during the 1956 Sinai war

who innocently said of the Egyptians, then fighting a British-French-Israeli

alliance: "We're so proud of them." The head of a conservative foundation in

Washington once lectured me along these lines. "Spanish--because of our

intimate contact with the Latin world--connotates a non-elite, drug-lord,

7-Eleven-store culture. Arabic is a distant, difficult, and thus mysterious

language, and fluency in it suggests erudite entry to a ruling class where Jews

and other ethnic Americans are not welcome."<p>



<p>



In the wake of Iraq's August, 1990, invasion of Kuwait, which most Arabists did

not anticipate, the term "Arabist" became even more negative. Francis Fukuyama,

then a Reagan Administration appointee on the State Department's Policy

Planning Staff, and now a consultant for the Rand Corporation, commented after

the invasion, "Arabists are more systemically wrong than other area specialists

in the Foreign Service. They were always sending cables, and coming into the

[Planning Staff] office, saying things about Saddam being a potential moderate

that now they're claiming they never said."<p>



<p>



The more it gained ascendancy as a term of political abuse, the more

indiscriminately "Arabist" came to be applied. During the Gulf crisis the New

York Times columnist William Safire and the Washington Post columnist Jim

Hoagland frequently described John Kelly, who was then the assistant secretary

of state for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, as an Arabist, even though

Kelly, with his limited Middle East experience, was distrusted by real Arabists

as a politically imposed outsider. By war's end anyone who was vaguely

sympathetic toward Arabs was being called an Arabist, even if he or she didn't

speak the language and had never lived in the Arab world. I asked a senior

Arabic-speaking diplomat at the State Department about the word "Arabist," and

he frowned, his chin slumping to his chest, as he muttered, "The word has

become poison; nobody uses it around here anymore."<p>



<p>



But people do. One reason is sheer convenience. Terms like "Arabic-speaking

officers" and "Middle East specialists" are simply too cumbersome. Another

reason is prickly pride. "NEA [Near Eastern Affairs] is the best bureau at

State," says one State Department Arab hand. "It attracts the best people

because Arabists are always exposed to crises." Another NEA type says, "Any

fool can learn Spanish in order to serve in Latin America." "The Eastern Europe

people never had a riot on their hands until 1989," says Carleton Coon Jr., a

former ambassador with wide experience in the Middle East. "They never had an

ambassador killed. Near East hands know what it's like to be shot at and in the

media hot seat." The attacks on Arabists notwithstanding, these people are a

self-assured breed, for whom the word "Arabist" implies a tight-knit fraternity

within the diplomatic corps, united by their ability to speak a "superhard"

language and by a vivid, common experience abroad that, as one Arabist told me,

"we can't even properly explain to our relatives." "We Arabists," says Hume

Horan, in a whimsical, self-mocking tone, "are the Pekinese orchids begot by an

American superpower. I suppose only a rich and powerful nation has a

justification for us."<p>



<p>



Horan knows that that is an overstatement. Arabists, or something like them,

would be needed by the United States in the Arab world even if America were to

abandon the internationalist assumptions of its foreign policy and its

overreaching hopes for a new world order. Leaving the question of Israel aside,

American businesses have economic interests in the Middle East worth many

billions of dollars. It is important to know what is going on in the region.

Then, too, there is the obvious matter of the Middle East's oil, on which much

of the world economy depends. Though it should stop well short of the role of

policeman, the United States clearly needs to maintain a significant presence

of some sort.<p>



<p>



And yet, even during the hottest moments of recent history in the Middle East,

few diplomats have been more anonymous than the Arabists have. With the

exception of April Glaspie, the recent U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Arabists are

just an opaque "them," even to many of their worst enemies. Arabists, I found,

are privately talkative, publicly shy. Like other bureaucrats and civil

servants, they don't call attention to themselves. They don't pontificate on

talk shows or op-ed pages. Peter Rodman, a fellow at the Johns Hopkins Foreign

Policy Institute, who ran the Policy Planning Staff in the Reagan

Administration, believes that the breadth, depth, and texture of the Arabists'

knowledge of the Arab world may work to immobilize their analytical thinking

about it.<p>



<p>



Buffeted by this and other, more sinister judgments about Arabists, I began an

investigation of them warily. In what follows I will describe conversations

with people who are or have been among the leading U.S. Arabists. I will look

at the origins of the calling in the lives and writings of a handful of

adventurers and missionaries. I will examine some of the psychological traits

that one encounters among Arabists--traits that may help to explain U.S.

diplomacy prior to the debacle in Iraq. Finally, I will describe the emergence

in recent years of a newer kind of Arabist, one who is perhaps more suited to

an adjusted view of America's role in the world.<p>

<I>Past and Present</I></b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>H</font>UME Horan speaking: "Here is the dilemma: God spoke Arabic. Oh, he may have

delivered an earlier, flawed message in Hebrew, in the Old Testament, or in

Greek, in the New. But he sure got it right the third time. The Koran is not

history or biography, like the Bible. It is pure revelation. Arabic is

coterminous with God. So, unlike English, which is a compost, a welcoming

cathedral, the most catholic of languages, Arabic is a completely closed

system, resistant to loanwords, a terrifyingly logical, well-oiled piece of

machinery that just clicks, clicks away. Once you've got the infixes and the

prefixes in your head, and the three-consonant root verbs you can construct any

word you want. It's like gene-splicing. And the religious etymology is so

intense, unlike English, where unless you've studied Greek or Latin, you can't

really feel the original meaning of the word. Another problem is that Arabic is

so beautiful to listen to. So you find yourself putting up with all kinds of

crap from these people because of the crystalline way their language lays

itself out in space. Just look at the Koran. The English translations are

incompetent, I know. The first chapters should really be footnotes at the end:

nothing but laundry lists, supplemental legislation--Leviticus. 'The Chapter of

the Cow'--bah how dull! But later on, bang, the revelations come at you with a

muzzle velocity of three thousand feet per second that just knocks you flat on

your can."<p>



<p>



Hume Horan, a boyish and gangly fifty-eight-year-old with close-cropped gray

hair, is edging toward his theme, not pausing for breath. He has recently been

in a bicycle accident, and is slumped back in his living-room chair, gesturing

with his right hand and left crutch. His eyes are drinking light, focusing on

some blank sheet of inner space, the kind a physicist might look at.<p>



<p>



Arabic, Horan goes on, may be no more insulated a language than Chinese.

Chinese, one could argue, is even more inimical to Western thought constructs.

The Arabs are desert monotheists. Averse to graven images, they harbor, in T.

E. Lawrence's words, a "clearness or hardness of belief, almost mathematical in

its limitation." They thus gravitate toward the abstract. Painting, sculpture,

and other plastic arts are not Arab fortes. "The medium in which the aesthetic

feeling of the Arabs is mainly . . . expressed," wrote Horan's mentor, the

Oxford orientalist Sir Hamilton A. R. Gibb (a man fluent in several Near

Eastern tongues), "is that of words and language--the most seductive, it may

be, and certainly the most unstable and even dangerous of all the arts."<p>



<p>



Horan picks up another strand: Islam was revealed in seventh-century Arabia, a

world of political anarchy and social degeneracy. "Mohammed--unlike Jesus,

whose mission could assume an ongoing classical order--had to propagate not

just a religious message but a social and political one. So Mohammed, in

effect, created a supertribe, based not on consanguinity but on a common

belief. This social invention proved more practical than Mohammed's political

one: his political system broke down with the assassination of the fourth

caliph. From then on Arab regimes lacked legitimacy. They had only expediency

to fall back on." Alienated from politics and gravitating for linguistic

reasons toward the ideal and the abstract, the intellectual energies of the

supertribesmen began focusing on religion and on shari'a law, "a universe,"

Horan says, "of splitting hairs and infinite refinements." Politics was

ignored, so there are "no legitimizing precedents for political life as it is

lived in contemporary nation-states." Socially, Mohammed's message "was

progressive in the Middle Ages but not now." So the existence of a supertribe,

stirred by the most idealizing and artistic of languages and employing a

medieval social code, yet operating in a complete political vacuum--a real

Darwinian universe of survival of the fittest--"makes the Middle East a

dangerous place not only for Christians and Jews but for all nondominating

minorities, even Muslim ones like Kurds and Palestinians."<p>



<p>



Horan, who has served the United States in Lebanon, Iraq, Libya, Jordan, Sudan,

and Saudi Arabia, is no romantic. He distrusts "the cultural remittance men and

international groupies who fill out their personalities in exotic backgrounds."

Here are his observations on Libya, where he and his wife, Nancy, lived for

several years:<p>



<p>



"We're dealing with the traumatization of the disadvantaged: the ultimate

vacuity, settled at the last moment by the loser tribes kicked out of Egypt and

Tunisia, who were then colonized by the Italians--rulers as nasty as they come.

In World War Two, battles raged back and forth across the desert and the rape

is complete. Afterward, it is the poorest country in the world, its biggest

export scrap metal from the war. Then, bang, instant wealth and a coup that

brings a true believer to the fore. The wealth goes to their heads, and of

course they hate everybody."<p>



<p>



Horan's maternal great-grandfather was a U.S. diplomat during the Lincoln

Administration. The poet Stephen Vincent Benet was a distant cousin. And his

father was Abdollah Entenzan, a Foreign Minister under the late Shah of Iran.

His parents divorced, and Horan grew up with his mother and stepfather, who was

a journalist and businessman, in Argentina. He returned to the United States to

attend private boarding schools and Harvard, but should not be dismissed as

merely the product of a good education. His fluency in French and German is

self-taught. Hopping around his library, he pulls a German novel off the shelf

with his crutch, turning the pages with it, proudly showing me his old

vocabulary lists. He is a jumping jack of energy and meticulosity. Holed up for

two weeks in the bullet-riddled U.S. embassy in Amman, during King Hussein's

1970 civil war with the Palestinians, Horan was limited to a quart of drinking

water a day, of which he denied himself enough to shave and wash the collar and

cuffs of his shirt. In Lebanon, Horan spent his nights translating an Arab

novel. In Libya he audited courses in shari'a law at an Islamic university. In

Washington he studied biblical Hebrew in order "to read Amos, my favorite

prophet, in the original" and to "understand Israelis as Israelis, to know them

through their own language, a language of boulders tumbling down

mountains--wow, no wonder they can be so tough." Horan races on, his eyes

swimming with enthusiasm and deep sensitivity. If only he had one more life.<p>



<p>



Horan is the Foreign Service's equivalent of a Talmudist. "He's the real thing,

a scholar-Arabist in the classic Bernard Lewis mold," says a former White House

official who has rarely had a good word for Foreign Service officers. "When we

do our job perfectly," says John Collier, of the Foreign Service Institute's

School of Area Studies, "the result is a Hume Horan." Horan is as much revered

inside the State Department as he is obscure outside it. A staple of diplomatic

lore is the fact that he completed a twenty-one-month advanced Arabic course in

twelve months, emerging with the highest language rating ever awarded to a

Foreign Service Arabist.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>A</font> BOOK published in 1837 by John Lloyd Stephens--<I>Incidents of Travel in 

Egypt,

Arabia Petraea, and the Holy Land</I>--helped fire Horan's enthusiam for his field.

Stephens, a New York lawyer, later achieved fame as an explorer of Mayan ruins

in Mexico. But he was also among America's first Arabists. Dressed in native

garb and armed with guns he flew the American flag over his boat on a trip up

the Nile.<p>



<p>



"Stephens was a true Jacksonian," Horan says. "Early America's spirit breathes

throughout his narrative." Horan cites the author's populist enthusiasm for

both Arab and Jew in the Holy Land, his hatred of Turkish despotism and

recognition of the suffering of African slaves, his interest in the practical

improvements recently made in plague-ridden Alexandria, and his complete lack

of paternalism and condescension. Horan was particularly taken with Stephens's

determination to confront a desert sheikh who tried to cheat him.<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

I assured [the sheikh] that . . . I did not believe there was a worse Arab in

all his tribe than himself; and finally, throwing open my trunk, I told him

that I did not fear him or all his tribe . . . and added, turning my pistols in

my belt, that they should not get it while I could defend it.









<p>



Keep cool is a good maxim, generally, in a man's walk through life, and it is

particularly useful with the Bedouins in the desert; but there are times when

it is good to be in a passion, and this was one of them.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>



Horan, too, has found that when dealing with Middle Easterners there are times

when it is good to be in a passion. In late 1984 Horan, as ambassador to Sudan,

played a key role in smuggling thousands of Ethiopian Jews, known as 

<i>falasha</i>,

through Sudan to Israel with the tacit help of the Sudanese government. After

the U.S. embassy's role in the rescue operation became public knowledge in the

Sudanese capital, Khartoum, there was hell to pay. Horan was accused in the

local papers of being an enemy agent, and anti-American sentiment grew in

intensity. Horan found himself living with several Sudanese bodyguards in his

ambassadorial residence. But he decided not to play it "cool and low-key."<p>



<p>



"At every reception I attended in Khartoum I told people I was proud of what we

had done, and that they should be proud too. I told the Sudanese government

that the departure of a few thousand hungry people was not going to alter the

correlation of forces between the Arab world and Israel. I had found an issue

to meet people head on with--so they knew that the United States stood for

something."<p>



<p>



Horan's habit of standing up for principles, combined with the treacherous

nature of Middle East politics, eventually derailed his Foreign Service career.

Saudi Arabia is more than America's principal strategic and financial ally in

the Arab world. Its uncompromising desert is where the foundation stones of

Bedouin culture and Islam were laid. For a State Department Arabist, therefore,

no position is more exalted than the ambassador's post in Riyadh. In late 1987

Horan was just settling into this job when he and his staff, assisted by

national intelligence findings, began to solve the latest riddle of the sands.

In the desert south of Riyadh, Washington learned, Chinese technicians were

installing medium-range ballistic missiles, easily capable of reaching Israel.

The Saudis had secretly broken an understanding with Washington, and Horan was

instructed to make clear to King Fahd just how distressed the United States

was. Horan delivered a formal protest in writing to the King. The shamed King

made it clear that Horan was no longer a viable interlocutor. Horan was

recalled to Washington. He later was elected president of the American Foreign

Service Association.<p>



<p>



"Hume Horan and I belong to an elite club," says Richard B. Parker, a

sixty-nine-year-old former ambassador to Lebanon, Algeria, and Morocco, "the

Awhab Shubak--'Arabists Who Have Been Shit Upon by Arab Kings."' (Parker's

tough reporting on Morocco caused King Hassan to demand his recall.)<p>



<p>



A feeling persists within the Foreign Service community that Horan was done in

not just by the Saudis and their powerful friends in Washington but also by

senior bureaucrats within the State Department, for being too perfect an area

specialist--that is to say, for understanding the Saudis better than they

wanted to be understood. Horan brushes these suspicions aside. "There is a

Kleenex quality to ambassadors. We're policy instruments, not policy-makers,

there to take the blame, to be wiped away so the process can continue." That

brings Horan to the subject of his fellow Arabist ambassadors. Making an arc in

the air with his finger, he says, "You can plot Arabists on a curve, starting

with the old hands and ending with the new generation. But I like to think that

the top of the curve is my generation."<p>



<p>



By his generation he means those who combined the intense interest in Arab

culture and literature evinced by the old-timers with the cool and skeptical

objectivity of the newer analysts. The origins of the profession lie deep in

the nineteenth century, and Arabists today are marked by some of the qualities

of their distant forebears. Their forebears influence as well which parts of

the Arab world are deemed to be of central importance--and that, in and of

itself, can be something of a trap.<p>

<font size=4><b>An Atavistic Relationship</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>ALCOTT Seelye's home, more so than Horan's, holds the material effects of a

lifetime spent in the Arab world: Oriental carpets, miniature paintings,

lithographs of the Holy Land, old books about the Middle East. I remember what

another Arabist told me about his colleagues' affection for exotic carpets:

"Rugs are a form of nomadic furniture that a Foreign Service officer can carry

around the world and that creates its own intimate space."<p>



<p>



"I want to write about Arabists," I begin. Seelye, a lanky and balding

seventy-year-old, smiles and answers with a question: "Have you read <I>The Wilder

Shores of Love</I>?"<p>



<p>



<I>The Wilder Shores of Love</I>, by Lesley Blanch, is a book about four Victorian

women who, as Horan would say, "fill out their personalities in exotic

backgrounds," accepting something that, Blanch wrote, "was vanishing from the

West, something to which they were all subconsciously drawn." The book

continues, "Repose: the Eastern climate of contemplation, of Kif, of

nothingness, brought to its quintessential state of voluptuous, animal

stillness was a state wholly alien to the West." Seelye is no escapist.  But

despite a sometimes stormy career that has brought him into head-on clashes

with supporters of Israel, among others, Seelye seems to have reached his own

state of Kif, and is at any rate willing to display a soft spot for romance.<p>



<p>



Seelye's grandfather and great-grandfather were both Congregationalist

missionaries who spent their entire adult lives in the Middle East. They were

part of an insufficiently studied chapter in U.S. history which saw Americans,

mostly New Englanders, fly the Stars and Stripes over mission outposts in

remote regions of Mesopotamia, Kurdistan, Syria, and Iran as early as 1820--a

time when the American West was still waiting to be settled. William Frederick

Williams, Seelye's great-grandfather, was part of a missionary group that saved

the life of Rabbi Sholoem of Mosul in 1853, after Muslim officials had arrested

the rabbi on trumped-up charges. His grandfather, William Nesbitt Chambers, was

an eyewitness to the Armenian holocaust and wrote a poignant memoir about it.

Seelye's father, Laurens, was a professor at the American University of Beirut,

in the city where Seelye was born.<p>



<p>



As a youth, Seelye returned to the New England of his ancestors and attended

Deerfield Academy and Amherst College. After military service in Iran during

the Second World War, Seelye joined the Foreign Service. Following a tour of

duty in Germany, in 1952, he switched to the Near East bureau, where he

remained for the next twenty-nine years, generally going from one embassy job

in the Arab world to another, ending with ambassadorships in Tunisia and Syria.

Seelye's daughter is continuing the family tradition: not long after graduating

from Amherst she moved to Jordan to teach, and subsequently she went to work as

a staff aide to Queen Noor.<p>



<p>



Seelye talks easily about the time in October of 1973 when, as ambassador to

Tunisia, he sent Secretary of State Henry Kissinger a cable advising him not to

send arms for Israel's defense after the surprise attack by Egypt and Syria. He

was, of course, ignored. Yet Kissinger was well enough aware of Seelye's skill

as a hands-on Arabist to trust him to go to Lebanon as a special emissary in

1976, after the assassination of U.S. Ambassador Francis Meloy Jr. Though

Seelye was criticized for utilizing PLO security men, he did manage to effect a

low-key evacuation of U.S. diplomats and their families from war-torn Beirut.

"I used the PLO simply because they controlled the area we had to pass

through," he explains.<p>



<p>



Later, when he was ambassador to Syria, Seelye's cables to the State

Department's Policy Planning Staff--so seemingly understanding of Syria's

actions--would cause Francis Fukuyama to scrawl in the margins, "Talcott Seelye

is the Syrian Ambassador to Washington, not the American Ambassador to Syria."

In 1981, upon his retirement from the Foreign Service, Seelye called reporters

into his office in Damascus to disparage the Camp David accords and to call on

the United States immediately to open a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation

Organization.<p>



<p>



Seelye insists on making a few things clear. "My boyhood in Lebanon was two

thousand percent American. I resisted learning Arabic and had to learn it like

any other Foreign Service officer. I had mixed feelings about serving in

Germany after the war, on account of what the Nazis did to the Jews. I went

into Arab affairs only because there were too many German-speaking officers and

the Middle East was opening up as a career. But given my family history, I

suppose my relationship with the Arabs is atavistic. In America we've lost the

attribute of the extended family, while the Arabs have this in spades."<p>



<p>



Despite the tenor of some of the high points in Seelye's career, he would

probably describe himself as holding a perfectly balanced view of the

Arab-Israeli conflict. He has visited Israel at least nine times. "Israel," he

says, "is one of our highest priorities in the Middle East. But it's a matter

of where we go from there." That there exists a mutual suspicion between many

Arabists and friends of Israel is as hard to deny as it is easy to understand.

Seelye recalls the time when he and a group of Arabists from the State

Department were invited to a Jewish fund-raising dinner. "At the end of the

evening, though, we [the Arabists] were all back at the same table alone

together. I guess they felt uncomfortable with us and perhaps we with them. It

was sort of a shame."<p>

Seelye says he does not keep up with current literature about the Middle East.

He goes back to "the old books," particularly George Antonius's The Arab

Awakening, published in 1938, "a seminal book that had an impact like no

other." <I>The Arab Awakening</I> is commonly regarded as the first book about the

struggle between Jews and Arabs told from an Arab point of view. But its real

significance, some would say, lies slightly afield. Antonius, a Christian Arab,

was anti-British but poignantly pro-American, describing U.S. missionaries as

the "foster-parents" of modern Arab nationalism. Seelye admits that this

characterization is somewhat of an exaggeration. Yet it is a story that

requires telling if the roots of his and the older generation of

Arabists'--tortured attitude toward Israel are to be properly understood.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>A</font>S Seelye explains, when his missionary forebears came to the Middle East, in

the early nineteenth century, they quickly realized that the Muslim Arabs were

not about to be converted to Christianity. But the missionaries discovered that

they had something else to sell, which the Arabs did want: Western education.

By 1860 American missionaries were operating thirty-three schools in the Middle

East. In 1866 came their crowning achievement--the opening of the Syrian

Protestant College, in Beirut, with a Vermonter, the Reverend Daniel Bliss, as

its president. The school would later evolve into the American University of

Beirut, commonly known as the AUB.<p>



<p>



Whatever official monuments there may be, in truth there has never been a

greater monument to Woodrow Wilson's vision of liberal internationalism--and

the difficulties such a vision faces in the real world--than the AUB. Here we

were in the sunny Levant, educating those less fortunate others who upon

graduation were assuming leadership roles in their own new nations, carved out

of a dying European imperialist order of which we were entirely innocent. And

not only were we openly loved for this activity, but as a very consequence we

were garnering political influence without having to dirty our hands in

realpolitik. "We basked in being disinterested good guys," recalls Arthur

Close, who comes from a Beirut missionary family. In 1945, at the charter

meeting of the United Nations, there were more AUB graduates among the

representatives than graduates of any other university. Eliahu Elath, a former

president of the Hebrew University, and other members of the liberal Jewish

intelligentsia in pre-Israeli Palestine were also AUB alumni. Daniel Bliss's

stirring vision had indeed become a reality:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A man white, black or yellow; Christian, Jew, Mohammedan or heathen, may enter

and enjoy all the advantages of this institution . . . and go out believing in

one God, or in many Gods, or in no God. But it will be impossible for any one

to continue with us long without knowing what we believe to be the truth and

our reasons for that belief.

However, in the wake of the Second World War came the creation of Israel and

the beginning of the superpower rivalry between the United States and the

Soviet Union, with its corresponding turf battle in the Middle East. The

old-time Arabists knew that with the vote on partition going against the Arab

world, and with the United States sworn to uphold Israel, the days of a beloved

American presence and an easy American influence were over. "In some of their

minds," Carleton Coon says, "Israel spoiled it all."<p>



<p>



In the 1950s, according to Terry Prothro, who was a psychology professor at the

AUB from 1951 through the mid-1980s, the university "became a place where the

Arab student body tried out all their political responses" to the challenge

posed by Israel. Some of the American faculty openly sympathized. In an essay

recalling those heady days, the late AUB president Malcolm Kerr wrote of

"heroes," such as "Faisal I of Iraq and Nasser"; "villains," including David

Ben-Gurion; "revered texts," among them <I>The Arab Awakening</I>; and "the problems

of the Arab-Western relationship," including "the usurpation of Palestine by

Zionists." Young Arabists could hardly have been unaffected by this climate.

Prior to the start of the Lebanese civil war, in 1975, the Foreign Service

field school for Arabic instruction was in Beirut (it's now in Tunis), and many

an old Near East hand has idyllic memories of pre-war Lebanon and AUB

friendships. Seelye told me that as a junior Foreign Service officer in Jordan

in the 1950s, he'd had a special relationship with the Jordanian cabinet

because "half of its members were ex-students of my father at the AUB." Horan

observes that the AUB finally emerged as "the translation of a religious and

educational calling into a political one."<p>



<p>



The Vietnam War further radicalized the campus: students and faculty members

saw America's support of Israel as an extension of its mistakes in Southeast

Asia. Israel's capture of Arab lands in the Six-Day War of 1967, Prothro

recalls, sparked the creation of a "pro-Arab, pro-Palestinian group made up

largely of AUB people," called Americans for Justice in the Middle East. But

campus radicals in the United States were never mugged by reality the way those

at the AUB were: the onset of civil war in Lebanon made the faculty and student

complaints of the 1950s and 1960s seem laughable. In the end, as the war

dragged on and Western hostages were taken, and after Malcolm Kerr himself was

murdered by Muslim extremists, "there was no politics among the Americans

anymore on campus," Prothro says. "Staying alive was the only thing that

mattered."<p>



<p>



The violent, drawn-out decline of the AUB was, for those of Seelye's

generation, symbolic of a wider catastrophe. It marked the destruction of what

the Protestant missionaries had lovingly helped, to build over the course of a

hundred and fifty years: an Arab political renaissance founded on American

values that, as fate would have it, collided in the night with another idea

grounded in Western liberalism--the birth of a Jewish state in Palestine.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>S</font>EELYE'S views regarding Israel may grow out of this collision. He belongs to a

post-Second World War breed of U.S. diplomat that Peter Rodman, a longtime

associate of Henry Kissinger's, labels "aggrieved area experts." This breed is

perhaps best understood through the career of the late Loy Henderson.

Henderson, along with George F. Kennan and Charles Bohlen, was a Kremlinologist

whose reports from Moscow before and during the Second World War painted an

extremely gloomy picture of Soviet life and Stalin's long-range intentions--a

picture that ran counter to the rosy image of the Soviet Union entertained by

many Americans back then. As a consequence, Henderson was ejected from the

Soviet bureau at State. He wound up in the division for Near Eastern and

African affairs, where he rose to become director at the time of Israel's

creation--something he was dead set against. Henderson perceived Israel as an

oil-less impediment to good relations with the oil-rich Arab world at a time

when the United States was entering a long, difficult struggle with the Soviet

Union. This was not anti-Semitism but just a cold-blooded exposition of what

Henderson saw as U.S. interests. It happened to be a sentiment that fit snugly

with the life experiences of Arabists of Seelye's generation. Older Arabists

like to compare themselves to the Kennan-Bohlen-Henderson school of

Kremlinologists. They argue that whereas those Soviet experts of yore were

victimized for daring to report the negative aspects of the Russian reality,

Arabists are victimized for daring to report the positive aspects of the Arab

one.<p>



<p>



A case in point: When Anwar Sadat came to power in Egypt, in 1970, Michael

Sterner, one of Seelye's Arabist colleagues with experience in Saudi Arabia,

Yemen, and Egypt, predicted that, as Sterner told me in an interview, "the new

guy will not be a facsimile of Nasser but will take things in a different

direction"--a point of view that at the time was criticized by the Israeli

government and many of its U.S. supporters. Sterner, whose opinion was based on

a personal relationship with Sadat, continues to regret that neither the

Israelis in the early 1970s, prior to the Yom Kippur War, nor, at first, the

Nixon Administration trusted Sadat's overtures. He showed me a montage from a

1971 edition of the Israeli newspaper <I>Ha'aretz</I> (The Land), depicting himself,

Murphy, and a handful of other State Department Arabists in Lawrence of Arabia

costumes. "This is how the Israelis ridiculed us," he said with a laugh.<p>



<p>



"But there really was lots of localitis back then," recalls Richard Parker, who

was a contemporary of Seelye's and Sterner's. Parker admits that he refused an

opportunity in the 1960s to learn Hebrew and serve in Israel, "because it might

have had an adverse effect on my career as an Arabist." Parker is studying

Hebrew now, however--in retirement.<p>

<font size=4><b>Iraq and Syria: A Romance</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HOUGH the American public tends to view the radical states of Iraq and Syria

with disdain, these two ancient lands represent the historical, literary, and

linguistic core area of an Arabist's life work. "Syria is the apogee of

Arabism," Horan says, "because the Syrians have everybody else's number and

nobody has theirs. I always regret that I never got to serve in Syria. Syrian

Arabic is the Arabic I most enjoy listening to. Iraqi Arabic, on the other

hand, is less aesthetically pleasing, because it has a heavy admixture of

Kurdish, Persian, and Turkish." This linguistic fact, however, is evidence of a

different allure: Iraq, in addition to being an Arab urban center second only

to Egypt in importance, is home to the Fertile Crescent's richest overlay of

civilizations. For these reasons, Horan observes, Arabists exhibit "a certain

weakness, a faiblesse," for Syria and Iraq.<p>



<p>



This faiblesse merges with the Arabists' grasp of the modern histories of the

two radical states, which is the result of reading, often in Arabic, and of

actually living in Damascus and Baghdad. "Syria sees itself as the most

mutilated descendant of the Ottoman Empire," says Richard Murphy, who became

America's first ambassador to Syria after President Richard Nixon

re-established relations in 1974. Indeed, when the great British Arabist

Charles M. Doughty traveled in the Middle East in the 1870s, the region was

divided into only two parts: the limestone plateau of the north, called Syria,

and all the rest--a sandstone desert stretching south to Yemen--called Arabia.

Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and the Turkish salient of Alexandretta were then

all part of Syria, and each was taken away. Murphy explains that whereas most

Americans see Syria only as a brutal regime of anti-Western peasant Alawites,

Arabists have lived in Damascus, where the Sunni population is urban and

instinctively pro-Western. Gene Cretz, who was an embassy political officer in

Damascus in the late 1980s, recalls, "Syrians are sophisticated and quite at

ease with Westerners, at least on a personal basis. I don't mean to sound

Pollyanna-ish, but I never had a bad day in Syria. Dealing with my Syrian

friends and acquaintances was as natural as breathing."<p>



<p>



Whereas Syria is a bastard child of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq is the Arabists'

very own Frankenstein creation. It was jerry-built by the British out of the

forlorn Ottoman vilayets ("provinces") of Kurdish Mosul, Sunni Baghdad, and

Shi'ite Basra, for reasons both base and altruistic: first, to have an oil-rich

foothold at the head of the Gulf to buttress British India; and second, in the words of the linguist,

archaeologist, explorer-traveler, and diplomat Gertrude Bell, to "make it a

centre of Arab civilisation and prosperity."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>I</font>RAQ became the experimental plaything for a band of British

scholars-cum-imperial agents. They included a personage as well known as

Lawrence of Arabia and ones as obscure as the Oxford don George Margoliouth.

Their eloquence led H.V.F. Winstone, a biographer of Bell's, to wonder whether

"the world might have been a more peaceful place for future generations if they

and their like had not been such able and persuasive writers." Bell was the

dominant figure of the group. "I read all of her books," says William Eagleton,

who was the top U.S. envoy to Iraq in the early 1980s. "I rate her very high."

Wealthy, well-connected, and passionate about the Orient, Bell once exclaimed,

"When we had made Mesopotamia a model Arab state there was not an Arab of Syria

and Palestine who wouldn't want to be part of it."<p>



<p>



Bell, the most influential British official in Iraq, never did go back to

Britain. She retired to a house in Baghdad and was referred to as Umm

al-Mumminin ("Mother of the Faithful"). "I am an Iraqi," she declared. Before

she died, she admitted that though the arguments she had used to promote Iraq

were political and economic ones, the "keynote" of Iraq "is romance" (her

emphasis).<p>



<p>



Bell was soon followed at the British embassy in Baghdad by another prominent

Arabist, Freya Stark, for whom Eagleton has much less enthusiasm. Stark

combined a gift for romantic travel writing with one for wrong-headed analysis.

A half century ago she saw a great future for democracy in Iraq. She also

believed that pan-Arab unity would prove as easy as "child's play." Stark was

part of a contingent of official Britons that dealt--or, rather, failed to

deal--with a pro-Nazi coup in Baghdad in April of 1941. The British ordered

their troops to stay on the sidelines while an Arab mob carried out a pogrom in

the Jewish quarter--resulting in more than a hundred and fifty deaths--in order

to allow time for King Faisal's soldiers, in Stark's words, "to win their own

fight unaided."<p>



<p>



Among the surviving Jews was a little boy, Elie Kedourie, who would grow up to

write many books and articles critical of the old British Arab hands. Kedourie

sees the 1941 Baghdad pogrom, known locally as the <I>farhoud</I> ("looting"), as the

direct result of decades of amateurish meddling in Iraq by the likes of

Gertrude Bell and Freya Stark, who, having invented a country and a power base

for an Arab Muslim population, should have assumed responsibility for the

minorities henceforth threatened by those Arabs. In <I>The Chatham Horse Version

and Other Middle-Eastern Studies</I>, Kedourie, now a University of London

professor, writes,<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

The right of conquest [the Jews of Baghdad] could cheerfully acknowledge, for

all their history had taught them that there lay safety . . . . It was not by

the help of this experience that they would understand the strange, exquisite

perversions of the western conscience: the genial eccentricity of Mr. Philby,

proposing to make a thug who took his fancy the president of an Iraqi republic;

or the fond foolishness of Miss Bell, thinking to stand godmother to a new

Abbassid empire; or the disoriented fanaticism of Colonel Lawrence ["of

Arabia"], proclaiming that he would be dishonoured if the progeny of the sharif

of Mecca was not forthwith provided with thrones. Yet it was with such people

that [the Jews'] fate rested.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



The Philby mentioned is Harry St. John B. Philby, who converted to Islam in

Saudi Arabia, acquired a slave girl for his earthly pleasures, and became a

Nazi and Communist sympathizer. (His son, Kim Philby, would formally cross the

line into treason, as a Soviet double agent.) In desert Arabia, Philby was

followed in stature by Wilfred Thesiger, another British Arabist and a fearless

explorer of Saudi Arabia's Empty Quarter.<p>



<p>



U.S. Arabists harbor a conflicted attitude toward these "sand-mad" adventurers.

One former U.S. ambassador to several Arab countries remarks that "nobody in

his right mind has nostalgia for these Brits." William Rugh, a former

ambassador to Yemen, argues, however, that "one of the most interesting things

in life is to cross a cultural barrier, and there are just not enough books by

Arabs about themselves." He adds, "I therefore have no problem with Doughty,

Philby, Thesiger. I've read all of Philby's books. I met Thesiger once in

Jiddah--a real eccentric character he was. These books help take you inside

[the Arabs'] heads." Rugh's point is that if you are a diplomat in Iraq or

Saudi Arabia or Yemen and you want basic ethnographic information about such

matters as tribal feuds and how geography has affected local mentalities, you

cannot avoid the books written by the old British hands.<p>



<p>



"Living in the Arab world," Horan says, "it is easy to become cynical if you

just concentrate on the politics. So you need to broaden your base, to become

interested in the local literature of a region." He mentions Charles Doughty,

who traveled alone for two years in northwestern Arabia. Doughty had a "briar

root quality" that even a self-declared nonromantic like Horan can admire.

Doughty wrote, "The sun made me an Arab, but never warped me to Orientalism."

It is the ultimate fine line that every good Arabist aspires to walk, Horan

seems to suggest--and that not every one is able to.<p>

<font size=4><b>PART II<br>



<i>The Iraq Debacle</i></b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE postmortem on the Gulf War has been under way for more than a year. The

indications are that it will continue for some time, as congressional

committees and other investigators reconstruct in fine detail the aims and

mechanisms of the foreign policy of the Bush and Reagan Administraions. There

will no doubt be many revelations. It is unlikely, however, that any of them

will alter the general picture of what occurred: a policy of support for Saddam

Hussein during his war with Iran led, after the war, to a policy of coddling

and drift. Why did this occur? What role, if any, did the Arabists play?<p>



<p>



The answer is not a simple one, but I will lay out some of the elements. First,

for a long time--indeed, during most of the period when Iraq was actively at

war with Iran--the Arabists had very little say in U.S. policy toward Iraq.

Washington did, however, have a well-defined policy of helping the one thuggish

regime against the other thuggish regime, which was openly and viciously

anti-American. That policy may have been imperfect and cynical, but it made

some sort of sense and it was a policy.<p>



<p>



A second element is the following: Arabists by and large were comfortable with

this policy anyway, for reasons, as we shall see, that have everything to do

with the history and psychology of their profession.<p>



<p>



A third element is this: When the Iran-Iraq war ended, U.S. policy entered a

period of ambiguity. Washington had no clear aims with respect to Iraq, except

to permit various financial and military interests in this country to do

business with Saddam Hussein. Secretary of State James Baker, moreover, was

increasingly preoccupied with German reunification and getting Arab-Israeli

peace talks under way. This was the time when Arabists might usefully have

sounded a warning--a warning at the very least to disengage. Instead,

conditioned by their past and by their training, and by their perception of

Iraq as the Arab country of the future, they pushed to maintain the status quo:

a measure of engagement, a measure of appeasement.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>W</font>ILLIAM Eagleton is called by his former colleague Richard Murphy "the last of

the great pashas" in the State Department. "Bill always had time for another

trip to the souk or into the Kurdish mountains, which he thoroughly enjoyed. He

loved getting away from Washington and into the field, which is not a bad

thing." Marisa Lino, the U.S. consul-general in Florence, who served with

Eagleton in both Iraq and Syria, explains that there are two kinds of State

Department Arabists, the Washington policy type and the overseas cultural type,

and that Eagleton was definitely the overseas type. Eagleton ran the U.S.

Interests Section in Baghdad from 1980 through 1984, helping pave the way for

the resumption of diplomatic relations between Iraq and the United States which

occurred following the end of his tenure. He later became the U.S. ambassador

to Syria, and then left the Foreign Service to work for the United Nations in

Vienna in behalf of Palestinian refugees. Eagleton is the only U.S. diplomat

with a working knowledge of both Arabic and Kurdish to have served in Iraq. If

ever someone in the State Department had the mental tools to understand Iraq

and where it was headed, it was--or should have been--William Eagleton.<p>



<p>



Eagleton was born in 1926 in Peoria, Illinois. He attended local public schools

before going to Yale, where he began to master Spanish and French. His first

Foreign Service job was in Madrid. "It was through southern Spain, with its

Moorish element, that I became romantically interested in the Arab world," he

explains. "I requested a Middle East posting and got Damascus in 1951." From

that point onward Eagleton's overseas addresses appear more akin to those of an

adventurer than to those of a diplomat: Kirkuk, in Iraqi Kurdistan; Tabriz, in

northwestern Iran; Tangiers, Morocco; Noukchott, Mauritania; Aden, South Yemen;

Algiers, Algeria; and finally Tripoli, Libya, before he went to live in Baghdad

for four years.<p>



<p>



"Read, travel, read, travel, that's the way to go," Eagleton told me.

"Certainly the old Victorian travel books, but also some of the modern

political stuff. An Arabist is someone interested in getting deep into the

culture and people of the region. Those who aren't interested in the culture

don't deserve the title of Arabist." Along the way Eagleton wrote not only a

political history of the shortlived Kurdish Republic of Mahabad (in post-Second

World War Iran) but also a book on Kurdish carpets. In all those places

Eagleton was his own boss, without even the need for ambassadorial

protocol--running a lonely consulate in a provincial backwater, or an interests

section in a radical Arab capital. When Eagleton was nominated to be ambassador

to Syria, in 1984, his long stints in radical countries raised eyebrows in

Congress. "The State Department didn't help me out much. I had to get Jewish

friends from Cleveland and elsewhere to call [Senators Rudy] Boschwitz and

[Howard] Metzenbaum to tell them--well; you know--that I was okay." Eagleton

felt compelled to tell me this, although I hadn't asked him about his

confirmation troubles. Actually, I found Eagleton's motives for passing his

life in places like South Yemen, Libya, and Iraq quite easy to fathom. At

sixty-five, he has eyes that still appear young and full of enthusiasm: they

are the eyes of a traveler who has retained a youthful disposition by means of

constant adventure, challenge, and cultural stimulation. Eagleton is a true

spiritual descendant of the early missionary-explorers.<p>



<p>



His critics on the State Department's Policy Planning Staff and on the National

Security Council in the early 1980s--Reagan Administration appointees, for the

most part--were never impressed, however. "Eagleton was a classic case," one of

them told me. "He didn't know how to apply his cultural and ethnographic

background knowledge to political analysis. We'd laugh at his cables."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>I</font> FIRST met Eagleton in Baghdad, in March of 1984. It was in the wake of a

horrific incident that the media generally failed to report. In June of 1983

Robert Spurling, an engineer from Illinois who was overseeing operations at the

Novohotel in Baghdad, had arrived at Saddam International Airport with his wife

and three daughters, in order to fly home to the Midwest. At passport control

an Iraqi official informed Spurling that there was a "small problem" with his

exit visa and asked him to wait while the rest of his family proceeded to the

departure lounge. After his wife and daughters passed through the barrier,

Spurling was arrested as a spy. Iraqi officials then ordered Spurling's wife

and children onto the plane without him. Somehow his wife managed to phone the

U.S. mission.<p>



<p>



For three months the Iraqi authorities denied any knowledge of Spurling. Then,

in August, after Eagleton's persistent appeals, Iraq admitted that it was

holding such-and-such a man. Eagleton's own check into Spurling's background

revealed that the Iraqi allegations of espionage were nonsense. In October the

Iraqis delivered Spurling to Eagleton's doorstep. Spurling had been subjected

to electric-shock torture in his genitals and elsewhere. He had been beaten

with weighted fists and wooden bludgeons. His fingernails and toenails had been

ripped out and his fingers and toes crushed. He had been kept in solitary

confinement on a starvation diet.<p>



<p>



A Canadian diplomat in Baghdad first told me the story, all of which Eagleton

confirmed, adding that Spurling had spent several days recovering at Eagleton's

official residence before flying back to the United States. "This is a

completely arbitrary system," Eagleton told me during our conversation in 1984.

"There are no laws, no charges filed; anything can happen. I wish I could

recommend one Iraqi official who would be worth talking to, who might say

something to you meaningful about his country. Unfortunately, there is no one I

can think of. They're simply too scared." Eagleton added that the Iraqi

security apparatus responsible for Spurling's arrest and torture was headed by

Saddam's half-brother, Barzan Ibrahim al-Takriti. Barzan later became Iraq's

human-rights delegate in Geneva.<p>



<p>



Eagleton also spoke about the Kurdish mountains. He indicated that one could

not comprehend the puzzle of Iraq by knowing the Arab pieces alone--an insight

that was less ordinary in 1984, when he expressed it, than it is now. Yet

Eagleton was enthusiastic about the Arab portions, too: "You should read what

the British had to say about Iraq. They loved this place." Though Eagleton

dutifully noted the Spurling incident in his annual human-rights report, he

urged me to see the matter in perspective. Never before had something like that

happened to a U.S. citizen here, and Eagleton implied that he had obtained a

commitment from the Iraqi authorities that it never would again. (So far it

hasn't.) "Saddam is at the tough end of the moderate Arab world," Eagleton

assured me in 1984. "Even when the Iran-Iraq war ends, Saddam could not return

to his radical policies, because Iran will continue to be a threat and Iraq

will need help from the Gulf Arabs."<p>



<p>



When I saw Eagleton again, seven years later in Washington, after the end of

the Gulf War, he defended that last statement. "I don't think I did anything

wrong. Saddam was at the time moving precisely in the direction we wanted him

to go--toward moderation. There was a period of a year back then when we had no

documented evidence of Iraqi involvement in terrorism. So our policy,

encouraged by [King] Fahd and [Hosni] Mubarak, reflected this. But I despised

Saddam. I knew Iraq in the good old days [before the 1958 military coup, which

ended the monarchy]. Now I couldn't even invite my friends from the bazaar to

come to my house and look at my rugs. They would have been arrested."<p>



<p>



Eagleton, who was held in suspicion by some of Saddam Hussein's clique because

of his demonstrated concern for the Kurds, and who deserves credit for

Spurling's release, did not feel in 1983 that the impending resumption of

relations between the United States and Iraq was worth disrupting over a single

incident, however unfortunate. An innocent American had been torn from his wife

and children and tortured in the manner of a dreary bureaucratic procedure,

unconnected to any war or invasion with which the United States was involved.

If appeasement was a force gathering from a variety of particulars, then the

U.S. government's ability to overlook the troubling implications of what

Saddam's half-brother had done to this American seems indeed seminal. But

appeasement does not perfectly describe our tragedy in Iraq. There are other

factors. There is that faiblesse that Hume Horan spoke about, and there is also

that ineradicable impulse among diplomats to find something useful to do in a

country where there may be little useful to be done.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>The Enthusiasm Factor</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>A</font>RCHIE Roosevelt, the grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt and a pioneer

Arabist at the Central Intelligence Agency, writes in his memoir, For Lust of

Knowing, "Baghdad held so many fascinations it was difficult to tear myself

away, but an entire country had yet to be explored and understood." It is the

period of the Second World War he is writing of, and as Roosevelt himself

points out, Baghdad was then a backwater of a backwater: a supply base for the

British in neighboring Iran, who were holding back the Germans and, after a

fashion, the Soviets there. His activities were less a function of the need for

intelligence on Iraq's peoples than of his own fascination with Iraq. David

Newton, another "top-of-the-curve" Horan contemporary, and the U.S. ambassador

to Iraq from 1984 through 1988, brought a similar enthusiasm to his job.<p>



<p>



"If you have a strong historical knowledge of a place," Newton told me, "you

see it through different eyes. And if you really know Baghdad, you can still

get a sense of the Ottoman city. It's hard--sort of like reconstructing Homo

erectus. But I love the souks. I'm a romantic at heart. During my time in

Baghdad, I used to give small groups of embassy personnel guided tours around

the city. One of the appeals of Iraq is that it's so distinctive. Once you're

there, you can't be anywhere else. It's a reality that's not quite Persian, or

Turkish, or even Arabian."<p>



<p>



Like Eagleton before him, Newton had a romantic interest in Iraq that, it must

be said, in no way blinded him to its horrors. These two men were always

willing to talk to the few journalists who happened to show up in Baghdad to

write about the regime's brutalities. When I first met Newton, in the Iraqi

capital in August of 1986, another foreigner--Ian Richter, a British

businessman--had just been arrested by the Iraqis on trumped-up charges. "This

is the most terrified population in the Arab world," Newton told me. "If the

security services somehow get it into their heads that you've done something,

there's not much any of us can do to help." During that same visit I had my own

brush with Iraq's regime-induced paranoia. I had been granted a visa to visit a

group of pro-Saddam Hussein Kurds in the north who held territory over the

border in Iran. But upon introducing me to my Kurdish hosts, Iraqi security men

confiscated my passport. I did not see it again until two weeks later, when, in

a car stuffed with the same morose-looking security men, it was handed back to

me en route to the airport. Last spring I sought Newton out again to discuss

what, exactly, he had thought he was accomplishing in Baghdad.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=5>N</font>EWTON is now the international affairs adviser at the National War College, in

Washington, D.C., his spacious office in a domed brick building that is

bordered by a golf green, the Washington Channel, and the Anacostia River.

These comfortable surroundings made me realize how ridiculous is the notion

that Arabists have fallen on hard times owing to the debacle in Iraq. Newton,

fifty-six, is a dapper man with a trim moustache. He has years of first-hand

experience in five Arab countries, and a "4" language rating not only in Arabic

but also in German. This kind of man, unlike so many of the policy mavens who

crowd Washington, has tangible assets that lose little of their market value

because of this or that failure in prognostication. Arabists are like doctors

and lawyers: you can be angry with them, but you will always have a need for

their skills. During the Gulf War, Newton acted as an adviser to the Pentagon.

Like Horan, Murphy, Eagleton, and other ex-ambassadors in the Arab world, he is

in a way making a sacrifice by staying in the academic and policy fields. All

these people could be earning more money with oil companies or other Middle

East business interests.<p>



<p>



"I was a bookworm as a kid," Newton recalls. "By eleven I wanted to be an

archaeologist, because of a fascination with ancient Egypt. What hooked me

permanently on the Near East was the lectures I attended at Harvard by Sir

Hamilton Gibb, a wonderful orientalist." Gibb, whose writings are replete with

exquisitely subtle criticisms of Arab Islamic civilization, is nevertheless

loathed by Elie Kedourie and other Zionists because of his fundamental

toleration of the existing Arab political order--just as Loy Henderson, though

admired by old State Department hands for his clairvoyance regarding Stalin and

his role in getting the Soviets to withdraw from northern Iran in 1946, is seen

by some friends of Israel as a villain who was opposed to the creation of the

Jewish state. Attitudes like these, refined and hardened over decades, toward

Gibb, Henderson, and innumerable other obscure figures, give the outsider a

sense of how vast is the psychological chasm separating the Arab-oriented and

Israeli-oriented subcultures in Washington.<p>



<p>



Yet it is a Palestinian Arab scholar, Edward Said, who is hardest on Gibb,

claiming in his book Orientalism that "Gibb's inaugural biases remain a

formidable obstacle for anyone hoping to understand modern Islam." Newton

responds, annoyed: "Said did a job on orientalists. You can't judge people of

the 1940s by the standards of the 1980s. There were no Arab scholars back then

on Gibb's level." Not only Newton but also other Arabists, I found, feel

genuinely caught between the animus of friends of Israel on one hand and that

of Arab scholars on the other.<p>



<p>



Prominently displayed in Newton's office are color photographs of himself and

April Glaspie--his successor as the U.S. ambassador to Iraq--in the

presidential palace in Baghdad, both smiling as they introduce Saddam Hussein

and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to a congressional delegation led by

Senators Robert Dole and Alan K. Simpson. This was the occasion, a few months

before the invasion of Kuwait, when Dole and Simpson apologized to Saddam

Hussein for Voice of America broadcasts critical of his regime. "I keep these

photos in the office as a teaching device: they fascinate my students," Newton

told me. He seems to be a man completely at peace with himself, who talks

easily and honestly about his mistakes.<p>



<p>



"Saddam put a lot of emphasis on nation-building and the Westernization of the

economy, which was popular. Because he had everybody scared, one would have

thought that there was no reason for excess brutality. Obviously, the gassing

of the Kurds [in March of 1988] affected my view. We worked on intuition, with

very few sources."<p>



<p>



"After the Kurds were gassed, why didn't you just pull out--close the embassy?"

I asked, alluding to a conversation I had had some years back with Robert

Keeley, a former ambasssdor to Greece who now heads the Middle East Institute,

in Washington. Keeley shut the U.S. embassy in Uganda at the time of Idi Amin's

reign of terror. "You maintain a diplomatic presence as long as you're

effective," Keeley told me. "But in Uganda there came a point when we really

were no longer able to have an effect. To be true to our own values, the only

thing we could do was to leave, and scream about Amin from the outside."<p>



<p>



Newton said, "That made sense for Uganda"--a landlocked country of no strategic

or economic importance to the United States. "But it's naive to think you can

just pull out of a militarily powerful and oil-rich developing country on the

Gulf with which American companies were doing hundreds of millions of dollars

of trade." What might have been accomplished in Iraq, according to Newton, was

that over time, with U.S. help, "Iraq's level of repression could have been

improved to that of Syria."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>A</font>RABIST-bashers could have a lot of fun with that statement, reeking as it

seems to of moral relativism. But it needs explaining. Despite several visits

to Syria, I was shocked the first time I arrived in Iraq. In Damascus, I could

walk into the telex room of the post office and punch out a story unsupervised.

In Baghdad plate glass separated me from the telex machines. My copy was handed

to an Iraqi on the other side of the window, and that was that. I could travel

wherever I wanted to in Syria; in Iraq trying to would have landed me in

prison. Going to Syria from Iraq was like coming up for air. Making a Syria out

of an Iraq would be a minor human-rights miracle. "But appreciating this,"

notes Peter Bechtold, who runs the Middle East area-studies program at the

Foreign Service Institute, "requires a frame of reference based on travel

experience that not only most Americans lack, but so do people on the National

Security Council."<p>



<p>



Frame of reference is the clue to understanding the behavior of Newton and his

colleagues in Iraq. Living in Baghdad lays bare a second reality besides the

one of the prison yard and the torture chamber: the reality of an urban,

essentially middle-class culture crying out silently to the West. In no other

densely populated zone of the Arab world is Islam so downplayed and literacy so

widespread as in Iraq. This urbanization has not come about through the

destabilizing migration of peasants into the big cities, as has occurred in

Iran and Egypt, although it is true that Iraq is unstable: because its

relatively efficient and well-educated people live in crowded conditions and

are riven by tribal and national feuds, extreme levels of repression are

required to hold the country together. Yet the promise of an Arab state

empowered by its middle class, and thus truly modern, has always been there; it

is what attracted the British in the first place. Until 1958, when the military

overthrew the pro-British monarchy, Iraq, in the words of the British Arabist

Peter Mansfield, "was the West's favorite Arab state," considered to have an

industrial and agricultural potential unrivaled in the Middle East. It was this

same ever-present pageant of secular urbanism, so much more visible and dynamic

than the analogous process in other Arab countries, that formed the ground on

which U.S. diplomats placed their hopes, theorizing that whatever the gruesome

brutalities of the regime, the social reality would eventually have to overcome

that which the regime tried to impose on it; one just needed to be patient and

work in the interstices until that day dawned. To be sure, for Newton,

McCreary, and the others, the sheer professional excitement of living and

working in a core Arab country provided a significant motive for investing

one's tour of duty with a high goal. By the time this enthusiasm wore thin, the

tour had expired and a replacement arrived bearing a fresh supply of idealism.

Competition for a posting in Baghdad was always intense.<p>



<p>



Norman Anderson, who served in Morocco, Lebanon, and Tunisia and also as the

ambassador to Sudan, makes this observation relevant to his colleagues in Iraq:

"There is not enough posting continuity in the Mideast, because with so many

embassies in Arabic-speaking countries, it is rare for a diplomat to go to the

same place twice. Kennan and Bohlen were able to be on target regarding Stalin

because they each had several tours of duty in the Soviet Union, the only place

where Russian is spoken." Though the situation was ameliorated somewhat by

"lateral cable traffic," whereby reports from the Baghdad embassy were sent for

review and comment to Arabists with earlier experience in Iraq, one was

nevertheless reminded of something that had occurred in Vietnam: because every

ambitious officer wanted time in a combat zone, they all got twelve-month

tours, and in the process little institutional memory was accumulated on the

battlefield.<p>



<p>



Some Arabists argue that the closed and totalitarian nature of Saddam Hussein's

regime made accurate assessments of it problematic anyway. Chas Freeman, who

has been the ambassador to Saudi Arabia since before the Gulf War, disagrees.

"Area expertise means sufficient understanding of a language and a local

reasoning process to put yourself in the position of a decision-maker in that

society and make a fairly accurate prediction about what he will do. If the

number of decision-makers is limited, then you actually have a better

statistical chance of predicting the future, because all your analytical

energies can be focused on one individual: Saddam."<p>



<p>



But the succession of embassy staffs in Baghdad--impressed, like the British,

by the awesome human and economic potential of Iraq--were not thinking coldly

enough about the bloodstained ruler of the country. Nor were they encouraged

to. Remember, the Arabists in Baghdad contributed to but did not ultimately

formulate U.S. policy. My talk with Eagleton in 1984 came during a period when

CIA Director William Casey was rumored to be striking an intelligence deal with

Iraq as a lever against the Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran.  U.S.-Iraqi trade was

then beginning to boom, and both the non-Arabist commercial element of

Eagleton's staff and the Arabist political one had few qualms about conducting

business as usual.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>A Policy Vacuum</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HROUGH Eagleton's and Newton's tenures in Baghdad the area specialists were at

least operating within a well-defined policy construct. In 1988, however, the

Iran-Iraq war ended, and Saddam Hussein provided a glimpse of his postwar self

by exterminating five thousand Kurdish civilians. That was the time to begin a

vigorous reassessment of the eight-year tilt toward Iraq, especially since a

new Administration was entering the White House and a new ambassador was about

to be dispatched to Baghdad. But the policy review seems never to have taken

place.<p>



<p>



Part of the reason for this was the new Secretary of State, James Baker, and

the way in which he shifted the balance of power inside the State Department.

Baker is the most powerful and interesting Secretary of State since Kissinger.

At the outset both men distrusted the career Foreign Service, particularly the

area specialists. But, according to Freeman, "Kissinger quickly acquired the

talent to dig into the bowels of the bureaucracy while circumventing senior

officials, in order to suck out the bank of information the area experts

represented." Baker is different. One former assistant secretary says, "To a

greater extent than Kissinger, Baker operates alone. He meets with a Middle

Eastern leader, then he tells Dennis Ross [the head of the Policy Planning

Staff] what Ross needs to know, then Ross gives orders to his own subordinate,

and so on. It's a narrow chain of command."<p>



<p>



The only Middle East issue that really energized Baker was the one with a

domestic political payoff: the Arab-Israeli question. That is why one saw the

elevation of people like Ross and Deputy Assistant Secretary Daniel

Kurtzer--people who are not traditional Arabists but, in the words of an

Arabist colleague of theirs, "Arab-Israeli wallahs," with limited interest in

peripheral inter-Arab disputes. This may partly explain why, as critics

observed, by 1990 Iraq was completely "off the radar screen."<p>



<p>



Ambassadors, Horan says, can and should make policy recommendations, but as

Foreign Service professionals they have a duty to reflect, exactly,

Washington's current attitude toward a particular country.  April Glaspie's

fate was to succeed Newton as ambassador to Iraq at a time when there was more

drift than actual policy. And so, as in the days of Her Majesty's colonial

administration--when the British Arab Bureau was a law unto itself--the area

specialists were left to fill the vacuum with their own goals and

justifications for being in the awful country they were in, goals and

justifications not always fully congruent with those of the nation whose

interests they were supposed to serve.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>April Glaspie</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>I</font>RAQ certainly has a way of conferring fame on female Arabists. But let it be

understood that April Glaspie is in a league entirely different from that of

Freya Stark and Gertrude Bell. They, despite their impressive knowledge, were

essentially amateurs whose leisure time, the result of inherited wealth,

allowed for the development of their personalities in exotic climes. Glaspie is

the opposite: a consummate professional and "Washington-type" Arabist, a

workaholic upper-echelon bureaucrat rather than a grand lady.<p>



<p>



Henry Kissinger is said to have been impressed by Glaspie during his shuttle

diplomacy of the mid-1970s, when she was posted to Cairo--and not because, as

has been suggested, she found a quick-service laundry for him but because she

was doing everything from finding the laundry to taking care of consular

matters to analyzing Egyptian political trends (this was before the U.S.

reestablished relations with Egypt, and our diplomatic staff was consequently

still skeletal). Hume Horan, his institutional loyalty flaring, bears witness:

"April's our Joan of Arc, top of the curve, a first-class Arabist. The media

need a villain, so they've painted her as 'the appeaser.' But ambassadors look

only as good or as bad as the policy they represent. I was fortunate in Sudan,

because Washington backed me up to the hilt with a moral and clearcut policy.

That was not the case in Iraq."<p>



<p>



Samuel W. Lewis, the president of the United States Institute of Peace and a

former ambassador to Israel, provided a more exacting interpretation of the

ambassador's role at a recent conference in Washington devoted to diplomacy:

"The responsibility of the ambassador and his staff is to know more about the

country they're in than anyone else and to make policy recommendations to the

government." In the view of Lewis, Horan, and others, the ambassador's

recommendations, if not always approved, should at least serve as the basis for

ongoing policy discussions regarding a particular country.  By this definition

Glaspie may not have been the villain that the scandal- and

personality-obsessed media require in order to simplify the complex question of

why the United States was caught off guard by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. But

more than any other individual in the career State Department, she does bear

responsibility. Therefore, a close look at her record is called for.<p>



<p>



"April has never been involved in any issue where she was not a policy-driver,"

says a former colleague who knows her well. "She was dynamic and aggressive,

and supremely confident. April dominated issues. It was just not in her

character to be a passive ambassador implementing a policy she did not fully

agree with." Indeed, Glaspie's influence on U.S. Middle East policy was

significant even before she became ambassador, when she headed the State

Department's northern Arabian division, which put Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan

within her domain.<p>



<p>



In fact, it was Syria's alleged terrorist activities that may have revealed

Glaspie's policy viewpoint most clearly. In 1986 British and Israeli

intelligence caught an Arab terrorist, Nizar Hindawi, attempting to smuggle a

bomb aboard an El Al jetliner at London's Heathrow Airport in the suitcase of

his unsuspecting, pregnant girlfriend. Electronic eavesdropping revealed that

Hindawi had been receiving orders through the Syrian embassy, whose ambassador

was subsequently expelled. The European Community took the unusual step of

imposing sanctions on Syria before the United States did. "April and Bill

Eagleton were violently opposed to a tough American reaction," says a former

colleague. "I remember violent discussions with them." One source describes the

policy dispute between Glaspie's northern Arabian division and State's

counterterrorism people as a bureaucratic "guerrilla war."<p>



<p>



"April Glaspie was much more protective of radical Arabs than our policy

justified," says a bureaucratic rival at the State Department. With respect to

Iraq, Glaspie advocated everything possible to make the Iraqis feel comfortable

to avoid a disruption in relations.  A Capitol Hill staff member adds, "Her

meeting with Saddam Hussein was the culmination of a failed policy line that

she and [NEA Assistant Secretary John] Kelly had been tirelessly advocating

since 1988." This same person indicates that Dole and Simpson's apology for the

VOA broadcasts calling for democracy in Iraq was the result of a prior briefing

by Glaspie, which "conditioned the senators for the cave-in." A second source,

who accompanied the senators on the trip, is of the same opinion: "I am a

hundred percent sure that the apology was the result of Ambassador Glaspie's

briefing."<p>



<p>



In September of 1987, when the State Department had submitted Glaspie's name to

the White House and Congress for approval as the next ambassador to Iraq, some

members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had not been pleased. True,

her record was impressive. Glaspie had won several State Department awards for

political reporting from Egypt and from Kuwait, and a Superior Honor award for

her work in Damascus. But, as one former Senate staff member told me, Iraq in

1987 was the only Arab country fighting a major war, and it had the most brutal

and difficult regime in the Arab world, and yet the State Department was

"pushing hard" a nominee who had never before been tested as an ambassador--for

a job where, as another staff member now puts it, "one's reporting skills are

less important than one's representing skills."<p>



<p>



Glaspie's reputation--deserved or undeserved--for being too sympathetic to Arab

radicals also did not help her. Another irritating factor, according to both a

Senate staff member and a formerly high-ranking Arabist, was that at roughly

the same time that Glaspie's name was submitted, the State Department had asked

Congress to confirm Robert H. Pelletreau Jr. as ambassador to Tunisia.

Pelletreau has always been popular in Washington. A former ambassador to

Bahrain who had worked at the Defense Department, Pelletreau had firsthand

experience in dealing with Israelis as well as with Arabs, and has a reputation

for being bold, analytical, and tough as nails. "We felt Glaspie should have

gone to Tunisia, a less challenging post, to gain ambassadorial experience,"

says a Senate source, "and Pelletreau should have gone to Iraq. He was the

perfect person for dealing with Saddam." (Pelletreau is now the ambassador to

Egypt.)<p>



<p>



As it turned out, the Senate committee held up Glaspie's nomination for six

months before confirming her. "A few people were uneasy about the choice," a

staff member says. "But there was no smoking gun."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>B</font>UT the truth about a person as talented as Glaspie is complex, and the

foregoing is just one layer of it. Chas Freeman recalls, "The few times I met

her, I got the feeling of a tough woman." Freeman met Glaspie in Bonn in April

of 1990, almost four months before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. They and other

U.S. ambassadors in the Middle East had come to Germany for a conference with

John Kelly. Among the many documents submitted for review at this

chiefs-of-mission conference was a long, three-part telegram crafted by Freeman

and his embassy staff in Riyadh. Freeman thought that the winding-down of the

Cold War would affect theaters beyond Europe. There would be "a collapse in the

Horn of Africa" (which soon took place, with the overthrow of leftist regimes

in Somalia and Ethiopia) and an upsurge in the expression of age-old local

rivalries throughout the Arab world. The telegram specifically warned of the

danger of Iraqi aggression against Kuwait.<p>



<p>



"The telegram flew in the face of Kelly and his staff," one source says. But

one of the few people who spoke up and supported Freeman's thesis about Saddam

Hussein's intentions was Glaspie. "April was certainly not wearing blinkers

regarding the despicable nature of the Iraqi regime and its potential for

troublemaking," said a source who had access to the pre-invasion cables.<p>



<p>



There need not be a contradiction between the April Glaspie whose policy

recommendations were soft on Saddam Hussein and the one who recognized his

potential for wreaking havoc. What her friends and enemies repeatedly mention

about her is that, as one person said, "April is intellectually honest, loves a

good argument, and is always willing to entertain another point of view." In

short, rather than a bureaucratic rubber stamp, she was an exemplary Foreign

Service officer, whose policy recommendations in this case--not to do anything

that would provoke or annoy the Iraqi President, because that would be likely

to feed his paranoia--turned out to be tragically inappropriate.<p>



<p>



"The Seventh Floor"--the Secretary of State and his top advisers--never did act

on Freeman's telegram. Kelly's skepticism may have been only one of the

reasons. Like most bureaucracies, the State Department is bedeviled by

information overload. Foreign Service officers send thousands of cables daily

from more than two hundred embassies and consulates around the world. Many

world crises have doubtless been predicted in one cable or another that never

got the proper attention. One Arabist says, "If George Kennan sent his famous

Long Telegram about Soviet intentions today, nobody high up would get to read

it."<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>Hostages to Idealism</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>N</font>OT only was April Glaspie perhaps the victim of a distracted policy apparatus,

but those signals that Washington did transmit to her could only have been

confusing. The Administration, concentrating on the Baltic States, the

reunification of Germany, and Arab-Israeli issues in early 1990, while

indicating its intention to withdraw from the Gulf those ships that remained

from the l988 Kuwait reflagging operation, seemed to encourage its diplomats in

Baghdad to ignore Iraq's behavior toward Kuwait (even as behind-the-scenes aid

to Iraq continued). To confront a powerful and volatile dictator, an ambassador

needs specific support from Washington. Otherwise--as the Foreign Service

drills into the heads of its career officers--an ambassador is supposed to

ferret out the ruler's intentions, take notes, and report immediately to the

State Department.<p>



<p>



April Glaspie met with Saddam Hussein one week before Iraq invaded Kuwait.

Glaspie saw Hussein without a notetaker, because she had been summoned to the

Iraqi Foreign Ministry on short notice and did not know that she was about to

meet the Iraqi President, with whom she had never had a private meeting during

her two years in Baghdad. She wondered if this could be the beginning of an

"opening," says a colleague of hers, and she obviously wanted the meeting to go

well, especially as there was no time to get special instructions from

Washington.<p>



<p>



Glaspie told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at an open hearing that the

Iraqi transcript of the meeting, which depicts her as acting in a fawning

manner toward Saddam Hussein, and as appearing to indicate that the United

States did not care how Iraq settled its border dispute with Kuwait, was

doctored. But Senate staffers say that the Iraqi transcript and her own cable

of the event "track almost perfectly." Glaspie, they and other observers

conclude, was the ultimate staff person--obsessed with the diplomatic process

to the point where she couldn't accept that sometimes it is better for the

process to collapse than for it to continue.<p>



<p>



Her performance turned out to be emblematic of the policy vacuum in Washington

and of the pathetic political labors of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad in the six

years since relations had been re-established. Only after Iraq invaded Kuwait

did Washington clearly enunciate its position, when George Bush and his

national security advisor, Brent Scowcroft, belatedly decided that Kuwait was

something we cared about.<p>



<p>



Glaspie told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that "by staying [in Iraq]

we could undertake diplomatic activity," such as extracting a promise from the

Iraqis after the Kurds were gassed "that they wouldn't do it again." Listen

again to McCreary: "In an awful country the smallest victory, no matter how

inconsequential, gives you an incredibly big boost." These are not unlike the

rationalizations of hostages, who try to occupy the endless stream of days with

uplifting activity. Rather than appeasers, our Foreign Service officers in

Baghdad--in the absence of responsible guidance from Washington--became

hostages to a professional idealism that blinded them to the obvious: by the

late 1980s having diplomatic relations with Iraq was not an achievement but a

concession.<p>



<p>



But maintaining relations is an entrenched habit of mind, and not just among

Arabists. The State Department's attitude, according to Robert Keeley, is "We

open embassies; we don't close them." In March of 1973, when Keeley sent a

cable advising Washington to "seriously consider" closing its Uganda embassy,

because of security problems arising from the iniquities of Idi Amin, the State

Department sent out an inspector to see if Keeley had taken leave of his

senses. Regarding Iraq, having recently upgraded the interests section in

Baghdad to full embassy status, after a lapse of seventeen years, the idea of

downgrading it to an interests section once again, in order to show displeasure

over the extermination of the Kurds, ran counter to the Foggy Bottom mindset

that Eagleton explains: "Once you downsize re-lations, it's hard to upgrade

again without a pretext, so you can't pull out an ambassador every time you get

mad."<p>



<p>



Richard Parker, Eagleton's longtime friend and Arabist colleague, politely but

strongly disagrees. "We certainly should have lowered relations in 1988. We

shouldn't even have re-established them in 1984. All it did was help massage

Saddam's ego." One of Glaspie's subordinates in Baghdad admits, "We had

absolutely no influence."<p>



<p>



Sustained only by vague hopes, the Americans in Iraq, like the British a half

century before, were destined to watch in disbelief as another farhoud

unleashed its fury. This time Kuwaitis, not Jews, paid the price.<p>



<p>



<p><BR>



<font size=4><b>PART III<br>



<i>A New Breed?</i></b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>A</font> BREAK in diplomatic relations constitutes the worst career nightmare for a

Foreign Service officer. That is why the will to cut relations must come from

the Seventh Floor and the White House. One U.S. diplomat who had been assigned

to a troubled Arab country told me, "If the size of our mission staff had been

cut down, I was next on the list to be sent home to Washington. I desperately,

desperately wanted to stay on post. I'm Jewish. The Six-Day War was one of

those defining moments of my youth, when I really identified with being a Jew.

Radical Arab countries were like the dark side of the moon for me. To learn

Arabic and serve as a diplomat in one of these places was just fascinating. How

could I be expected to want to leave after just arriving?"<p>



<p>



I'll call this diplomat Walter--he is an Arabist who may again serve in a

radical Arab country, and does not want his real name used in connection with

his religion. He has been a political officer in both the Arab world and

Israel. He is distinctly middle-class, with degrees from the State University

of New York at Binghamton and Stony Brook. I interviewed him at his

mother-in-law's townhouse, in an unremarkable New Jersey development, where he

was spending his vacation between assignments.<p>



<p>



Walter is typical of the new generation of Arabists now moving into important

positions. An increasing number of them have ethnic and suburban roots, have

studied Hebrew, and have served in Israel. Molly Williamson, an Asian-American

who speaks both Arabic and Hebrew, was recently named the U.S. consul general

in East Jerusalem--perhaps the most sensitive of Foreign Service assignments,

because of its key role in Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations. Though she

refuses to be quoted, Williamson revealed herself in several recent

conversations with me to be someone who has gone beyond mere objectivity, to a

point where she deeply intuits the angst-ridden thought processes of Arabs and

Jews alike. The elevation of a new-breed Arabist like her not only suggests

that knowledge of both Semitic languages is a likely route to promotion in

today's State Department but also shows how James Baker, despite his grievous

mistake over Iraq, seems to be sharpening NEA into a precision tool for the

years of tortuous peace negotiation ahead.<p>



<p>



Another characteristic of the new Arabists is that many of them have Peace

Corps backgrounds. Walter, for instance, served in the Peace Corps in the

Muslim word before joining the Foreign Service. More than a third of those

Foreign Service officers chosen for last year's Senior Seminar--a prestigious

program for potential ambassadors--were Peace Corps veterans. The Peace Corps

experience, redolent as it is of foreign aid to the Third World, may seem

hopelessly out of date in the current post-Cold War climate. But in terms of

what the Foreign Service needs to improve its analytical skills and to adapt to

this new reality, the Peace Corps has never been more relevant.<p>



<p>



Peace Corps graduates, adept at living and working in the bush on meager

resources, are oriented toward a leaner Foreign Service that gets out onto the

streets--embassy paperwork be damned--to find out what is going on. The growth

of the Peace Corps contingent among Arabists, and in the Foreign Service at

large, runs parallel to the middle-class takeover of the formerly elitist State

Department--a process that has now reached the point of saturation. A Peace

Corps background in today's State Department carries the allure that an Ivy

League education once had.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=5>T</font>HESE new Arabists stand old stereotypes on their heads. Alberto Fernandez, for

instance is a thirty-four-year-old Cuban-American from Miami. A graduate of the

University of Arizona, he came into the Foreign Service by way of the U.S.

Army, where he volunteered for Arabic training at the Defense Language

Institute. "After growing up in an insular and suffocating ethnic society, I

needed something completely different to define myself," he says. Because of

his knowledge of Spanish and Arabic, Fernandez has served in Nicaragua, the

Dominican Republic, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.<p>



<p>



He is critical of the older generation: "It's true Arabists have not liked

Middle Eastern minorities. Arabists have been guilty in the past of loving the

majority and the idea of Uruba, which roughly translates as 'Arabism.' I

remember once going to a Foreign Service party and hearing people refer to the

Maronite Christians in Lebanon as fascists. I love and am fascinated by

minorities: Maronites, Copts, southern Sudanese, Kurds, whatever. I feel less

strongly about the cause of the Palestinians than I used to. There are lots of

injustices in the world, and self-determination is not something the Arabs want

to apply anywhere else in the Middle East."<p>



<p>



Yet Fernandez, like all the Arabists I interviewed, sees the Arab world

embarking on a long and convoluted path toward political modernization. Other

Arabists adumbrate Fernandez's point. Although unable to predict specific

developments a few months down the road, they draw the vague outlines of the

longer-term future more confidently. "The Saudis will, over time, rewrite their

social contract without ever ripping up the old one," Chas Freeman, the

ambassador in Riyadh, says. Jack McCreary says, "There is an enormous widening

gap between the regimes and the people. Arabs see clearly that they are cut off

from their own governments and that their press lies. Arab intellectuals trust

Israel Radio's Arabic service more than their own stations. If Arab governments

want to control their own populations in the future, they're going to have to

tell the truth more often." Dovetailing with such liberalization, some Arabists

say, will be a further breakup in the Arab world itself, with the Mahgreb

states and the Gulf sheikhdoms increasingly consumed by their own regional

problems.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>W</font>HATEVER the destiny of the Palestinian-Israeli relationship, it seems possible

that the coming decades in the Middle East may be less traumatic for the United

States than previous decades. Although Americans are certainly disappointed at

Saddam Hussein's ability to hold on to power in Iraq, the Arabist assumption

that Iraq will undergo a middle-class-driven reform in keeping with its secular

and urban character may yet, given enough years, prove accurate. If history

teaches us anything, it is that nothing is permanent. But the metamorphosis

will be frustratingly slow.<p>



<p>



Peter Rodman, of the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute, wonders whether

the Arabists' best days actually lie ahead. "Since we will no longer have to

look at the Middle East in East-West terms, it might be more appropriate, as

Arabists have always urged, to treat the region on its own terms. But Arabists

may blow their opportunity if they take a sentimental view of the

fundamentalist phenomenon, which is the new strategic danger." In a new

climate, in which various forces impel Arab leaders to focus inward on their

own societies rather than on Israel, the interstices that Arabists operate

within should be wider and remain open for longer periods.<p>



<p>



The importance of exploiting those interstices--pushing matters like food aid,

cultural relations, and hostage negotiations forward before an opening

disappears, and then going back and starting over again--cannot be overstated,

for it is in this way, rather than on the level of grand policy, that Arabists

do their most effective work. Norman Anderson, the former ambassador to Sudan,

observes, "Foreign affairs has become so complicated and multilateral--with

issues like drugs, the environment, and famine, as well as trade and

military--that Washington can't know exactly how its policies are to be carried

out in each individual country in every specific case. That is the job of the

embassies. And it's hard to gather information on a country and do all this

without knowledge of the language." He adds that just as he was the only

Arabic-speaking U.S. diplomat in Sudan when a coup occurred, April Glaspie was

the only Arabic-speaking U.S. diplomat in Iraq on the eve of the invasion of

Kuwait. (McCreary had finished his tour of duty there.) Although around two

dozen U.S. embassies and consulates have multiple job slots requiring a

knowledge of Arabic, Anderson notes that "in the same year in which we

dispatched five hundred thousand troops to the Arab world, the Foreign Service

field school in Tunis could graduate only half a dozen Arabic-speakers." His

implication is clear: if we had produced more of the latter over enough years,

we might not have needed the former.<p>



<p>



During a recent vacation on the Rhode Island shore, Chas Freeman imparted to me

his vision of a smaller and more expert Foreign Service, perhaps along the

lines of European ones, whose officers are all multilingual and

street-wise--again, the Peace Corps model. An affectingly cocky and opinionated

man who speaks Chinese and a half-dozen other languages in addition to Arabic,

and who translated for President Nixon during Nixon's 1972 visit to China,

Freeman gripes about a Foreign Service bureaucracy that now produces too much

paperwork and too few language-proficient officers, and a Washington

foreign-policy establishment that distracts everyone's attention with solecisms

that don't relate to what the United States should or should not do, can or

cannot do, in the field. "To focus more effectively on domestic policy, you've

got to disengage politically from foreign policy while engaging in it at a more

expert level on the ground overseas."<p>



<p>



That is not to say that we need a cadre of independent operators. Even in the

conduct of a diplomacy marked by diminished activism there is no substitute for

clear objectives, clearly spelled out by Washington. But assuming that these

exist, then the expertise and frontiersmanship of the Peace Corps veteran Jack

McCreary--the wiser from his experience in Iraq--are the qualities we should

look for in a post-Cold War Foreign Service.<p>

	<font size=5>D</font>mitri Tymoczko, 

	in <A HREF="../../96may/nitrous/nitrous.htm">"The Nitrous Oxide Philosopher"</A> (May <I>Atlantic</I>), at times qualifies the 

	religious beliefs of William James as "potentially" false. However, the 

	conclusion of the article, where Tymoczko seems to be speaking for himself, is 

	less tentative. There he speaks of "the pleasing illusions of the religious 

	visionary," and "the pleasing illusions of religious belief."<p>

	

As James cautioned in <I>The Will to Believe</I>, "If we are to discuss the question at 

all, it must involve a living option. If for any of you religion be a hypothesis 

that cannot, by any living possibility be true, then you need go no farther." 

Confirmed pragmatist that he was, James did not conceive of truth in absolute terms,

 but he concluded in the final lecture of <I>The Varieties of Religious Experience</I> that

  "that which produces effects within another reality must be termed a reality

   itself, so I feel as if we had no philosophic excuse for calling the unseen or

    mystical world unreal." Without such openness and respect, any consideration 

    of religion risks taking on a condescending tone, even when it has the 

    meritorious object of protecting religion's free expression. I am afraid that 

    this is the way Tymoczko's argument strikes me when he reduces the Native 

    American's peyote-induced religious experience, along with the non-drug-induced

     experiences of great mystics throughout the centuries, to "pleasing illusions."

	<font size=5>D</font>mitri Tymoczko is wrong when he states flatly 

	that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in effect reinstated the

	 Native American Church's right to use drugs in its religious rituals. 

	 The RFRA does no such thing. It simply restores the requirement that 

	 the government demonstrate a "compelling state interest" to legitimize

	  any action that inhibits a religious practice. States wishing to ban

	  ritual drug use may still argue that such a compelling interest--control

	   of dangerous drugs--does exist and validates prohibition.<p>

	   

	   Contrary to the 

	   author's assumption, Justice Antonin Scalia and other 

signers of his majority opinion in the Oregon case (<I>Employment Division v. 

Smith</I>) were not much concerned about the issue of drug use and the "double 

standard." Scalia even hinted in his opinion that he favored states' 

legalizing Native American ritual drug use--as Oregon has now done after 

winning the right not to tolerate it. Scalia was more concerned over the 

general problem of order, which he thought arises if any government action 

that incidentally restricts a religious practice must be considered 

presumptively invalid pending a showing of a compelling state interest.

<I>	Dmitri Tymoczko replies:</I><p> 

It is disturbing to think that religious belief might be useful and yet 

false--even William James, in his later years, backed away from this unsettling 

possibility. Religious believers (and people sympathetic to religion) naturally want 

to believe that religion is at least potentially true; atheists naturally do not like 

imagining that it contributes substantially to human welfare. Yet the disturbing nature

 of this thought should not prevent us from considering it carefully. If we do face a 

 set of difficult choices between pleasing illusions and disappointing truth, we should

  confront the problem, not avoid it for fear of upsetting people.<p>

  

Judging that states had failed to meet the "compelling interest" standard, several 

courts (notably the California Supreme Court, in <I>People v. Woody</I> [1964]) have upheld 

Native Americans' right to use peyote in their religious rituals. The Religious Freedom

 Restoration Act effectively restored this route to legalized drug use. The RFRA has

 also been used (in an Eighth Circuit court decision last February) to overturn 

 Rastafarians' marijuana-possession convictions. Furthermore, in 1994 Congress 

 extended the RFRA's protection of religious freedom, legalizing Native American peyote

  use in all fifty states. <p>

  

  Speculating about judicial motivations is a tricky and 

  potentially unrewarding business. Suffice it to say that the "double standard"

   <I>should</I> be an issue of real concern to all of us, Justice Scalia included. 

   Having recognized religious drug use as legitimate in one particular case, we 

   should think about extending this recognition to others whose claims are similarly 

   strong.<p>

	<font size=5>J</font>oseph J. Romm and Charles B. Curtis assert that 

	fuel-cell technology has the best chance of replacing petroleum in 

	transportation (<A HREF="../../96apr/oil/oil.htm">"Mideast Oil Forever?"</A> April 

	<I>Atlantic</I>).  It is a point well taken, but it deserves some 

	amplification.  First, it could well be that the long-term (whatever 

	that is supposed to mean) context in which they are placing their hopes 

	may shrink considerably.  Romm and Curtis presumably didn't know it 

	when they wrote their piece, but the German car maker Daimler-Benz 

	subsequently announced that it would present its first fuel-cell 

	passenger car, developed in collaboration with the Canadian company 

	Ballard Power Systems, at a press conference in Berlin on May 14.  By 

	comparison, under the Department of Energy's timetable the first 

	American prototype is not expected to be unveiled until some time 

	around the turn of the century and maybe even later.  <P> The 

	Daimler-Benz announcement caught many people by surprise and is 

	regarded as a major milestone in the field.  Although many people 

	believed that Daimler-Benz and Ballard were generally ahead of those 

	American and Japanese car makers that are working on fuel-cell 

	projects, nobody expected that Daimler would go public that soon.<P> 

	Ballard rolled out prototype fuel-cell-powered buses a couple of years 

	ago.  Chicago, Vancouver, and possibly Chula Vista, California, each 

	will put three of them on the road in real-life operations for paying 

	passengers either late this or early next year.  <P>Also relevant in 

	the fuel-cell context is that one American company, ONSI, of South 

	Windsor, Connecticut, a subsidiary of United Technologies by way of 

	International Fuel Cells, is already selling commercial--albeit still 

	expensive on a per-kilowatt basis--small 200-kilowatt fuel-cell power 

	plants for office buildings, hospitals, and similar stationary uses.  

	Other designs by other manufacturers are well under development.  Some 

	are small and unobtrusive, and all are quiet and cleaner and more 

	efficient than conventional power plants.  ONSI has placed about 

	sixty-seven of its designs in various installations around the world, 

	and in April the company reported that the entire fleet had accumulated 

	more than a million operating hours, with availability averaging 95 

	percent.  <P> Finally, it is important to note that fuel cells 

	represent the technological gateway to an intrinsically clean, by 

	definition environmentally benign, zero-emission energy system 

	ultimately independent of any fossil fuel.  Making hydrogen for fuel 

	cells from natural gas or other fossil fuels, as Romm and Curtis state, 

	is really only a transitional step, albeit one that may last several 

	decades.  The ultimate goal is to produce hydrogen by splitting water 

	into its constituents, hydrogen and oxygen, by the well-known process 

	of electrolysis, with electricity derived from renewable solar energy 

	in all its variants--hydropower, wind, photovoltaics, for example--or 

	other biological and chemical processes now under development in many 

	laboratories around the world.  <p>

<font size=5>J</font>oseph J. Romm and Charles B. Curtis are to be congratulated on a 

superb article detailing the ill-advised and potentially disastrous cuts in federal 

funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy. Unfortunately, a similar 

precipitous decline in energy-conservation spending in the private sector promises to 

exacerbate the problems of environmental damage and energy resource depletion.

 Specifically, I am referring to the demise of utility-company energy-conservation 

 programs. <P>

Beginning with the Reagan Administration's cuts in DOE spending in the early 1980s,

 responsibility for providing actual energy-conservation programs (as opposed to R&D) 

 was largely shifted to the nation's utility companies. Until very recently this

  strategy worked quite well, as utility "demand-side management" programs experienced 

  dramatic growth (to more than $3 billion a year by 1994). This strategy appeared so

   successful that in 1993 President Bill Clinton projected utility-company programs 

   to be the single greatest contributor to carbon-dioxide reductions in his Climate 

   Change Action Plan. <P>

Unfortunately, concurrent with the philosophical shift in Congress in 1994, the 

electric industry and most of the state agencies regulating that industry embarked on 

a path toward deregulation. Among its other effects, this change has brought

 utility-sponsored energy-conservation programs--a booming industry in the early 

 1990s--to a virtual standstill this year. In fact, staff members formerly responsible 

 for energy conservation at many utilities have been reassigned to energy sales

  promotion, in an effort to expand profits in the new "competitive" market.

   If the telephone industry is any indication, electricity consumption in the United 

   States is likely to increase substantially if electric deregulation proceeds.<P>

<I>	Joseph J. Romm and Charles B. Curtis reply:</I><p> 

 

	We share Peter Hoffmann's enthusiasm for fuel cells. They will be one of the key 

	technologies of the twenty-first century, because of their very high energy 

	efficiency and extraordinarily low emissions. They are already being used to power 

	buildings and electric utilities, primarily with hydrogen converted from natural

	 gas. In June the Department of Energy dedicated a two-megawatt fuel cell at a

	  municipal electrical station in Santa Clara, California. Daimler-Benz has now

	   demonstrated that fuel cells can fit the space requirements of a car. However,

	    many additional technical and cost hurdles remain. <P>

The Department of Energy has made major advances in automotive fuel cells. 

Sadly, the President's budget request of $42 million for transportation fuel cells in 

fiscal year 1996 was cut in half by Congress and may be cut again this year. While our 

trading competitors demonstrate their commitment to this seminal American technology, 

Congress rejects this investment in our nation's energy, environmental, and economic 

future. <P> Martin Kushler is correct that there are many ominous trends in the funding of

 energy-efficiency efforts. The cuts in utility conservation programs he writes about 

 are just one example. Another is the reduction by many states, including New York and

  Pennsylvania, in their state energy offices. Congress itself has cut not only

   research and development for energy-saving technologies but also federal 

   investments to help get those technologies into the marketplace, such as programs 

   to weatherize low-income homes and to help reduce the federal deficit by 

   retrofitting government buildings. If these trends continue, not only will we 

   abandon technological leadership in the rapidly growing world market for clean

    technologies but also we will be condemning ourselves to inefficiency, with

     negative economic and environmental consequences.<p>

<blockquote>





	<font size=5>T</font>HE midsummer morning before their wedding, in an enchanted forest near Athens,

Shakespeare's Theseus and Hippolyta can think of nothing more romantic than a

hunt with hounds. "We will, fair Queen, up to the mountain's top / And mark the

musical confusion / Of hounds and echo in conjunction," the Duke of Athens

declares. Encouraged by her approving reply, he adds a few words that only a

lover of homely dogs could appreciate: "My hounds are bred out of the Spartan

kind . . . / With ears that sweep away the morning dew; / Crook-knee'd, and

dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls; / Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like

bells, / Each under each."

<p>

Tonight we are thousands of years and thousands of miles from the setting of

<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, but the hounds still roughly resemble the

Duke's description. Their voices hardly bring bells to mind, though. Distorted

by distance and overexertion, their yips and squalls drift toward us in this

midnight dark, rising to a pitch of pure hysteria. As the dogs lose the scent

and circle to rediscover it, their voices lace together and unravel, climbing

and falling through the stunted hardwood forest. Somewhere ahead a raccoon is

scrambling to stay ahead of them, doubling back on his tracks or paddling down

a creek, trying a few desperate tricks before crawling up a tree. For a while

the dogs send reports of their progress. Then, abruptly, their noises fade,

leaving us stranded in these strange woods.<p>



"Which way did he go, George?"<p>



"I can hear the blue bitch, but I think they're all lost."<p>



"They'd get found if they'd come back this way."<p>





		<img src="./dog.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="" border=0>





The occasion is the first round of the Oklahoma State Professional Coonhunters

Championship. Throughout these low-lying hills "casts" of four dogs--one per

coon hunter--are competing to see how many raccoons they can run up trees. In a

competitive coon hunt a judge starts his stopwatch when a cast is released and

stops it when a raccoon has been treed or hunters have given up on a particular

spot, repeating the process until two hours have elapsed on the watch. During

those two hours the dogs try to rack up as many points as possible: the first

dog to strike a trail earns 100 points, the second earns 75, the third 50, and

the fourth 25. The first dog to tree a coon earns 100 points, the next one 75,

and so on. If, as often happens, the treetop is too dense with leaves for a

coon to be spotted, the dogs are awarded provisional points that can be used to

break a tie. Even when they are spotted, the raccoons won't be

touched: competitive coon hunting is a bloodless sport. <p>



No breathless chase, no feats of marksmanship, no cathartic kill: for the dogs'

owners, the thrills are nearly all secondhand. Standing in the dark, listening

to distant baying, coon hunters piece together the story of a hunt, picturing

themselves in their dogs' places, careening through greenbriers in search of a

scent. To score points, a hunter has to hear his or her dog's voice through the

hubbub, understand its every inflection, and tell the judge when the dog

strikes a trail or trees a coon. Mistaken claims are severely

penalized--barking at a false trail or barking at an empty tree can cost up to

100 points--and some dogs are given to ambiguity.<p>



With our headlamps off I can just make out my companions: four coon hunters and

one other observer, their outlines faintly phosphorescent with starlight. To my

left Sondra Beck's sinewy shape is hunched over a cigarette ember. "I don't

know what I'm doing with Sandy out here," she says. "She just had a litter

seven weeks ago." Most hunters still prefer larger, more aggressive male

coonhounds (though that is changing), but Beck has never had anything but

females. They may be out of commission from time to time, she says, but they're

less apt to pick a fight or get distracted. "Some folks say females are in heat

twice a year but males are in it all year round."<p>



In a sport that demands a certain irrational dedication--a willingness to

endure solitude and sleepless nights in pursuit of nocturnal prey--Beck still

rates as something of a fanatic. She began hunting with her brother at the age

of six, and over the ensuing forty-seven years has almost never been without a

dog. In the foothills of the Kiamichi Mountains, where she runs a kennel for a

living, the raccoons are in a constant state of alert: Beck hunts more than 340

nights a year, most of the time in the woods behind her mobile home.<p>



In <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> the Queen of the Amazons claims to have

gone bear hunting with Hercules and Cadmus themselves. But even she might have

been reluctant to climb into a truck full of men in the dead of night, drive

along deserted county roads, and walk into the woods for three to six hours at

a stretch. In all her years of hunting Beck has never had another woman in her

cast, yet she hasn't been daunted by the company or the competition. Over the

past ten years she has placed first in the Oklahoma State Coonhunting

Championship and second in the Texas State Coonhunting Championship, and she

has beaten her own husband--also an accomplished hunter--in the quarterfinals

of the Coonhunting World Championship. Long-limbed and gristly, Beck can

out-hike most of her competitors, and her dogs are impeccably trained. <p>



Good coon hunters can detect uncertainty in a dog's voice through a mile of

forest and the din of other dogs. They can tell when a dog is "runnin'

trash"--ignoring its training to trail a skunk or a bobcat--and when it has

found more than one raccoon in a tree. They are only truly in the dark when

their dogs are quiet--as the dogs tonight have been for a few minutes now.<p>



A sharp, squeaky bark comes from deep in the woods, like the sound of an ax

biting into hickory.<p>



"Tree, K.C.!"<p>



One by one the hounds' voices lift from the same point in the woods, sounding

as hungry, if not quite as harmonious, as those of wolves. A typical dog's

bark, seen on a sound spectrogram, is midway between a whine and a growl--a

confused "come-here-go-away" sound. Domestication, some animal behaviorists

believe, has turned dogs into arrested adolescents, oscillating endlessly

between affection and aggression. But these coonhounds hardly sound confused.

Though they have been bred as carefully as the crops in this once-wild country,

and though their hunting has grown stylized and recreational, their howling

still means meat.<p>



We wait a few more minutes before switching on our lamps. Generations removed

from people who hunted to survive, we can't expect to shed our own

domestication. But in the dark, listening to those ravenous voices, we can

imagine how doing so might feel. <p> <pre> 

</pre>

 <font size=5>C</font>OONHOUNDS, like Bowie knives and Winchester rifles, began as frontier

tools--European designs adapted to the American wilderness. George Washington,

whom one could call the father of coonhound breeding as well as of the country,

received seven Grand Bleu de Gascogne hounds from the Marquis de Lafayette in

1785. Like Theseus, Washington owned dogs capable of a melodious noise--his

stepgrandson compared their voices to the bells of Moscow--but he was less

impressed by their hunting skills. Long-eared and tireless, Gascon hounds were

famous for having the keenest nose of any breed and for having chased France's

wolves to extinction in the Middle Ages. For centuries, however, they had

hunted only things that stayed on the ground: hare, deer, wild boar. Once in

Virginia, they ran into trouble. Raccoons, like bobcats, American gray foxes,

mountain lions, and other native animals, have a penchant for hiding in trees.

A dog without a treeing instinct might charge right past such quarry, or else

abandon it before the owner caught up. Four months after receiving his French

hounds Washington complained that he was still "plagued with the Dogs running

Hogs."<p>

Many American colonists needed all-purpose "varmint" dogs for their survival.

Any hound that could scare animals up trees suited their purpose, so they threw

English foxhounds, Cuban bloodhounds, German boxers, and red Irish hounds into

the canine melting pot. By the early 1800s new American breeds had begun to

emerge. In the Great Smoky Mountains the descendants of a German immigrant

named Johannes Plott used their schweisshunds as the foundation for a breed of

brindle-colored dogs soon famous for hunting bear. In the Ohio Valley a scout

and Indian fighter named Simon Kenton helped to breed the first black-and-tan

coonhounds, known for their magnificent ears and sensitive noses. In the

Louisiana bayous the descendants of French trappers bred bluetick coonhounds

that could nearly pass for Lafayette's pure Gascon hounds. The <A HREF="http://www.zmall.com/pet_talk/dogs-faqs/kennel-clubs/UKC.html"><A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/dogs-faq/kennel-clubs/UKC/faq.html">United Kennel

Club</A></A> now registers six coonhound breeds--English, Plott, bluetick, redbone,

black-and-tan, and Treeing Walker--but the elite <A HREF="http://www.akc.org/akc/">American Kennel Club</A> fully

recognizes only black and tans. One bluetick owner told me, "The AKC would

rather register some strange, furry little animal in China than the dogs that

helped build this country."<p>



Most coonhounds are still proudly plebeian. Loose-jointed and ungainly-looking

when loafing on a porch, they turn sleek with purpose on a hunt. Nose to the

ground, pendulous ears stirring up day-old scents, they howl into the woods

whenever they smell success. Advertisements for dogs in magazines like

<i>American Cooner</i> and <i>Coonhound Bloodlines</i> invariably show them at

the height of their powers: paws high up on a tree, eyes rolling backward, neck

streaked with drool. "My cold-nosed, cat-footed, bawl-mouthed, chop-mouthed,

pressure-tree Grand Nite Champions breed true every time," an advertisement may

say. Loosely translated, this means "Like their parents, the puppies I'm

selling have a good sense of smell and durable feet; they should bawl when they

strike a trail, switch to a bark when they tree a coon, stick by the tree until

the owner comes, and, thanks to all these qualities, win the highest honor

available in the coon-hunting world."<p>



Sandy, Sondra Beck's dog, is the latest model in coonhounds, bred specifically

for competitive hunts. Trim and light on her feet--more foxhound than

bloodhound--Sandy doesn't waste time worrying out cold trails inch by inch, as

a "cold-nosed" dog would. She skims over the terrain to home in on the

freshest, "hottest" scent and run it down as quickly as possible. Some hunters

miss the behemoths they grew up with and the epic hunts those dogs used to

lead, but Beck has no regrets. "Those black and tans, they might pick a trail

three days old and howl and boohoo over it for hours and hours," she told me on

the way to the coon hunt. "I don't have any time for that. I need my dog to

move that track." <p> <pre> </pre>

<font size=5>T</font>WENTY or thirty pickups arrived before us and were gathered in a crooked half

circle in front of a corrugated-aluminum shack. Here and there hunters slouched

against fenders or tugged on their hip waders, killing time as the sun crept

behind the blackjack oaks. Though they looked as ragged as sharecroppers, few

had spent less than $10,000 on coon dogs and hunting gear, and some had spent

much more. Their hounds, tied to tailgates with frayed lengths of rope, could

fetch up to $20,000 apiece from a breeder. Their mud-spattered trucks were

crammed with electronic gear: radio-tracking systems, lamps with interchangeable

lenses, and collars that can give a small shock if a dog barks up the wrong

tree. When competitive coon hunters aren't demonstrating such gizmos, they are

usually discussing their dogs' sperm counts. Many of them regularly send their

champion studs to a place like Galaxie Genetics Reproductive Center, in Ohio.

There employees collect a dog's semen in a plastic vagina, package it in

"straws" chilled by liquid nitrogen, and send it off by courier for next-day

insemination. <p>

As the first fireflies rose to meet the dusk, light streamed from the shack's

open door, drawing a swarm of restless hunters carapaced in crusty overalls.

Inside, a few of their wives and children were serving french fries and chili

dogs from a plywood stand. Beck, as usual, was the only woman in hunting gear.

"A lot of the women, they try to learn to love coon hunting 'cause that's what

their husbands do," she said. "But there ain't no natural reason to like it.

Stumbling out there in the night just to listen to a dog howl--it just don't

make sense." Women who are "born lovin' coon hunting," as Beck says she was,

may be less enamored of the gossip they tend to create. Vickie Lamb-Deal, a

coon hunter from southern Georgia, remembers getting an anonymous letter from

some of the wives of coon hunters in her club. "They told me that I had no

business hunting with men, that I should form my own club with other women,"

she says. If they had just stopped to think about it, Lamb-Deal went on, they

would have realized that the swamp--with the mud and the bugs and the

snakes--is "the last place" you'd choose to flirt with someone's husband.<p>



Beck has never had that kind of trouble. With her pixieish features, cropped

blonde hair, and easy, joshing style, she is a perennial and unrepentant

tomboy--ignored by the girls, adopted by the boys. "My sister was different

from me--feminine and all," she says with a smirk. "She was the type, you'd say

'spider' and she'd run a mile." Beck's own children were "town kids by nature

who just happened to be raised in the country." When Beck took them out on

their first hunt, her son disappeared in the middle of the night. She found him

sitting in a patch of grass, reading a Hardy Boys novel with a penlight. He is

now a computer programmer in Dallas.<p>



A television and a satellite dish are the only signs of technology on Beck's

sixty-acre farm near Antlers, Oklahoma--"eighteen miles from the nearest loaf

of bread." Goats, orphan calves, bobtail cats, and a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig

named Louise wander around her mobile home. Most of them are strays brought in

by the local game warden. In the morning, when Beck leads her puppies into the

woods for a run, the pig and some of the goats usually tag along.<p>



"We're a different breed out here . . . beyond civilization," Beck likes to

say. She can still walk out of her house and hunt for three days and nights

without seeing another house, supplementing her supplies with dewberries, sand

plums, possum grapes, and wild persimmons. She lives a short hike from some of

the state's last virgin bottomland forest, but she knows it won't be long

before the old-time landowners die off or sell out. Within a generation the

land around Antlers may be not so different from the land in central Ohio,

where a coon hunter I know named Berton Oney has sent his English hounds after

coons for the greater part of seventy years. "I'd say we have lost three

quarters of the territory where we used to hunt," Oney says. "Most of our woods

are so small you can only hunt them for an hour before you have to get back in

the pickup."<p>



Longtime hunters like Beck and Oney live in a limbo between two eras. As Oney

puts it, "The sport seems to get bigger all the time and the terrain gets

smaller." Fifteen years ago, when coonskins sold for thirty or forty dollars

apiece, Beck earned her Christmas money coon hunting. (Winter, when raccoon

pelts are thickest, is the official commercial coon-hunting season.) Some of

her poorer neighbors went further, decimating the local raccoon population.

("You couldn't really blame them," Beck says. "A man could work all week for a

hundred dollars and then go out and make as much in two hours in the woods.")

But as anti-fur sentiment has risen and fur prices have plummeted, many have

given up on coon hunting. "I think on the whole coon hunting has probably

declined," says Tom Dooley, a former manager of coonhound field operations at

the United Kennel Club. <p>



At the same time, competitive hunters have embraced coon hunting: the number of

licensed UKC coonhound events grew from 5,428 in 1984 to 6,751 in 1994. A way

of life is evolving into a sport--a wilderness fix for those who can't live

eighteen miles from the nearest loaf of bread. Beck still spends more time

treeing raccoons on her own than in competitions, but these days at

Christmastime she puts out feeders for the raccoons rather than selling their

hides.<p>



In a sense things are coming full circle. As parts of America grow to be as

tame as England, and as coonhounds are bred to look more like foxhounds, so too

has coon hunting begun to resemble fox hunting. Solitary hounds carefully

sniffing out trails are disappearing, replaced by packs of frantic dogs,

expensively equipped, earning points in national competitions. Coon hunters may

never wear scarlet coats and black caps, but twenty years from now their

clothes may share some of their other gear's sophistication, growing as costly

and understated as the Orvis outfits favored by fly-fishermen.<p> <pre> 

</pre>

<font size=5>T</font>HERE is less than half an hour left on the judge's stopwatch, and we have yet

to see a coon. We hoped to surprise a few munching on ripe mulberries in a

nearby grove, but the dogs led us to huge, crooked post oaks instead. We probe

their branches with the beams of our headlamps and blast on whistles designed

to sound like an injured animal (raccoons are inveterate rubberneckers), but

though the dogs bark with real conviction, our lamplight catches no glimmering,

inquisitive eyes.

Slogging back to the road through a marshy meadow, the dogs and their owners

look equally abashed, their shapes stooped and spectral ahead of me.<p>



"Well, Katie, I don't know what the hell you're doin'," one of the hunters

tells his bluetick. "But it's about time you treed a damn coon."<p>



Beck doesn't talk to her dogs much on a hunt, "but I like 'em to talk to me a

little bit more than Sandy's been doin'," she says now. At moments of unseemly

quiet hunters used to comfort themselves with tales of raccoon subterfuge--of

animals jumping from tree to tree or running down gravel roads to hide their

scent--but competitive hunts, with their quick-treeing dogs, have changed the

character of coon legends. Hunters now talk about how tough coons can be in a

fight, how they can whip almost any dog one on one. A week earlier Beck was at

a hunt in Paris, Texas, where four dogs chased a raccoon into a lake. Clumsy in

the water, while the raccoon was in its element, the dogs had to content

themselves with swimming around it and barking. The coon bided its time. When

it noticed that one of the females was tiring, it calmly crawled onto the dog's

head and drowned her. <p>



Halfway back to the trucks the dogs seize upon another trail. As the minutes

tick off on the judge's stopwatch, we listen to them toiling through the

mulberry grove, their voices now exaggerated, trying to convince themselves as

well as their owners. Fireflies drift above the marsh grasses like torches

carried by a distant search party. Then comes a blaring squall from far to our

left, well away from the other dogs. <p>



"Tree, Sandy!"<p>



While the other dogs were wasting time on cold trails, it seems, Beck's dog

peeled off and found a coon on her own. If so, this is a "split tree" in

coon-hunter parlance--the crowning skill of a well-trained coonhound.<p>



But Beck is suspicious. She has a dog named Alf that will bark 135 times a

minute when he trees a raccoon. Sandy isn't usually so exuberant--she averages

eighty or ninety barks a minute--but on this night she is downright taciturn.

We try to follow the sound of her voice, but minutes go by without a bark. When

Sandy starts up again, her voice has a hesitant, faltering quality, like that

of a child who is knowingly telling a lie but can't seem to remember the truth.

<p>



"Please, y'all, don't judge her by tonight," Beck says, scissoring her legs

across a barbed-wire fence. Sandy isn't the quickest dog in her kennel, but she

is usually a "classy" tree dog: up on her hind legs, propped against the trunk,

head thrown back as she barks. By the time we reach her, however, her pose is

hardly self-assured. Cowering against the base of the trunk with the rest of

the dogs, Sandy looks up at Beck, clearly disconcerted. Her only consolation is

that the other dogs don't know what to make of the situation either.<p>



We strafe the branches with our headlamps, hoping for a glimpse of flashing

eyes. Like Sandy before us, we whoop just once at the sight of scuttling forms,

and then realize our mistake. These creatures are too small, too indifferent to

our lights and noise, to be raccoons. The fringe of folded white fur along

their sides eventually gives them away: flying squirrels. We trudge around the

tree, gathering the dogs, dumbfounded. In thousands of hunting hours few in the

cast have seen a flying squirrel before. Beck looks up at the squirrels one

last time, shaking her head. "I know my dog didn't tree those things," she

says. "They don't hardly touch the ground to leave a scent." <p>



No matter: Sandy has won the cast, if only with provisional points. And though

we have seen no raccoons, the dogs at least were convinced that they saw one

earlier. After hours in the dark, with only their voices to guide us through

the forest, we are inclined to believe them. In a sport so dependent on the

imagination, why rob ourselves of a happy ending?

<blockquote>
	
	<font size=5>I</font>N going about my winter business in the country around 
<A HREF="http://www.sover.net/~bratchmb/">Brattleboro, Vermont,</A>
I have gotten stuck in the snow and ice about fifteen times. That is not a lot
for twenty-five winters' worth of driving in Vermont, much of it up and down a
rugged elevation of some local fame called Newfane Hill, on whose side I live
and whose ancient Algonquian name, I am told, means &quot;Oil Trucks Put On 
Chains.&quot;<p> 
No, in these parts hitting the ditch an average of 0.6 times a year isn't bad
at all. But more surprising to me than my relatively untroubled career in
winter driving is the fact that of those fifteen or so mishaps only one has
required a tow truck. One dark night I slid off Route 5 just north of 
<A HREF="http://www.basketville.com/bvlocale.html">Putney</A> to
such good purpose that I had to call the wrecker. But every other time I have
come to grief, I have been put right without benefit of clergy, so to speak.
Why? Because I have been helped by my fellow man. Friends, neighbors, perfect
strangers, have stopped, lent a hand, and gone on their way. <p>

Like every other longtime winter driver in 
<A HREF="http://www.genghis.com/tourism/vermont.htm">Vermont,</A> I have had many
helpers--though to be honest, I should say more helpers than help. Through the
long winters up here the icy mountain roads bring out some of the best, most
altruistic instincts that people can have, but they bring them out by an
elliptical route. For there is something in the sight of a car pathetically
stranded on a snowy shoulder that inspires otherwise sensible men and women
with the spirit of debate, the spirit of controversy. Getting helped out of a
winter ditch by passing Good Samaritans, one finds oneself not only the
grateful recipient of generous aid but also the object of a certain
hill-country ritual of assistance.<p>

A case in point:<P>
<font size=5>O</font>N a bright January morning a couple of years ago I was coming home up the
hill, driving carelessly along trying to remember what, exactly, happened in
the Defenestration of Prague, when suddenly I felt the hindquarters of my wagon
begin to describe a counterclockwise arc--speedily, irresistibly, in a classic
rear-end skid.<p>
In this situation the advice of the experts is unanimous. You remain calm. You
don't brake. You steer deftly in the direction of the skid, so that the
momentum of the car can straighten it out. That is good advice--but I seldom
follow it. I find that what works for me in a skid is to hit the brakes as hard
as I can, shut my eyes, and repeat certain words at increasing volume until I
land wherever I'm going to land.<p>

So it happened that morning in January: the rear went east, the front went
west, and the whole show, with me in it, wound up half on the road, half in the
ditch, pointing back down the hill, and stuck, stuck, stuck.<p>

At this point in any such debacle my procedure is always the same. I turn off
the motor and get out of the car. I then walk around the car, examining it
closely but dispassionately, as though it were no car of mine but one I have
discovered inexplicably abandoned by persons unknown. Doing this introduces an
element of disassociation into the episode which prepares me to receive help
when it arrives.<p>

Help arrived that morning in the form of two fellows in a truck. They stopped,
got out, and joined me in surveying the problem. We agreed that the road was
slick, the car was mine, the car was stuck. (Here and in the next several
paragraphs I reduce a fairly prolonged and complex exchange to its
essentials.)<p>

&quot;Not bad stuck,&quot; one of the men said to his partner. &quot;He's headed downhill. He
ought to start up, straighten his wheels, and just tickle the accelerator. Just
ease it out.&quot;<p>

&quot;He doesn't want to ease it,&quot; the other said. &quot;He wants to punch it. Get in.
Start up. Straighten out. Then punch it. Punch it.&quot;<p>

&quot;He doesn't want to punch it,&quot; said the first. &quot;He punches it, he'll dig in.
He'll never get off. We'll have to pull him.&quot;<p>

<i>Pull him?</i> I thought. <i>Yes</i>.<p>

Another car came up the road and stopped. A young woman got out. She wore a red
woolen hat with a pompon. She came over to the car, got down on her knees and
looked underneath, brushed snow away from the ditched rear wheel, and looked
some more. She stood.<p>

&quot;He ought to ease it,&quot; the first man said.<p>

&quot;He ought to punch it,&quot; the second man said.<p>

&quot;He's only spinning one tire,&quot; the young woman said. &quot;He ought to throw the
wheel hard left, put it in reverse, and back it up. That will make him roll off
the patch he's spinning on. Then he gets into forward and drives right out.
Easy.&quot;<p>

&quot;He doesn't want to reverse,&quot; the first man said. &quot;He reverses, he'll get so
far down in there he'll never get out. We'll have to pull him.&quot;<p>

<i>Pull him?</i> I thought. <i>Why not?</i><p>

&quot;Nobody's going to pull anybody,&quot; the young woman said. &quot;Just do it,&quot; she said
to me.<p>

I did it. It didn't work. We had a storm of flying snow and dirt, and we had
considerable screaming of tires, but I ended up a couple of feet farther down
in the ditch than I had been, with my front end tilted now at a jaunty angle to
the horizon. I got out of the car.<p>

&quot;It was worth a shot,&quot; the young woman said.<p>
&quot;I guess now we'll have to pull it?&quot; I said.<p>
&quot;We can't pull it,&quot; the second man said. &quot;We've got no chain.&quot;<p>

&quot;I've got a chain,&quot; the young woman said.<p>

So the two fellows got her chain and hooked me up to their truck, and with them
in the truck pulling, the young woman beside the car pushing, and me driving,
we got me back in business easily enough. There followed the unhooking, the
stowing of the chain, the thanks, the offer of payment, the offer's refusal,
the return to vehicles, the beep, the wave, the parting. Time elapsed since
help arrived: twenty minutes. Time required for effective help to be applied:
two minutes. Time required for advice: eighteen minutes. Exactly 90 percent of
the transaction, therefore, was occupied not with practical assistance but with
. . . what?<p>

<font size=5>W</font>HAT was served? I'm not sure, but I suspect that these unhurried rural
negotiations of suggestion and advice, assertion and doubt, amount to a kind of
ceremony affirming a principle that many people--including, I'm afraid,
me--prefer to neglect: Nobody does anything alone. Even those people who think
they do--those people especially--need help, get help, take help gratefully,
but never quite on their own terms. When your helpers arrive, they give what
they have, in their own way, in their own time. Your part is to receive, to
accept, and to learn, so that when you come to the same ceremony in the
opposite role, you'll know what offering to bring. Someday the adviser will be
you. What will you say?<p>
I always tell them to punch it. &quot;Punch it,&quot; I say. &quot;Just punch it.&quot;

	<i><font size=4>Two partisans explain and debate the authorship

question.</i></font><p>

	

	

	<pre>

	

	</pre>

	

	<font size=5>D</font>uring the past two centuries doubts about the identity of the author of the

works attributed to William Shakespeare have brought a small cottage industry

into being. To date more than 4,000 books have been written on the authorship

question. Passions and interest have always run high.<p>



<p>



The roots of the enterprise can be traced to the 1780s, when the Reverend James

Wilmot moved to Warwickshire, where Shakespeare had lived, to gather

information for a biography. After covering himself, in the words of one

scholar, "with the dust of every private bookcase within a radius of 50 miles"

of Stratford and finding no books that had been owned by the playwright or

other physical evidence, Wilmot burned his notes for fear of their

implications. Eventually Wilmot revealed to a visitor his belief that the works

of Shakespeare had been written by "some other person," perhaps Sir Francis

Bacon. Because the secondhand account of Wilmot's conclusions did not surface

until 1932, the credit for the opening public salvo in the debate is given to

Delia Bacon (no relation to Francis) and William H. Smith, who each published a

book in 1857 suggesting that William Shakespeare of Stratford could not have

been the author of the works of "Shakespeare." Both writers implicated Francis

Bacon.<p>



<p>



Nathaniel Hawthorne, who wrote the introduction to Delia Bacon's book, in 1863

also wrote an Atlantic article in which he praised her conviction, if not her

conclusion. Bacon's scholarship had a profound effect on Mark Twain, who said

his disbelief in Shakespeare as the true Bard "was born of Delia Bacon's book."

But neither Twain nor any of the other prominent figures who have expressed

"anti-Stratfordian" beliefs--Henry James, Walt Whitman, and Sigmund Freud,

among others--has exempted the doubters from academic scorn (in many cases well

deserved). The Shakespeare scholar Alfred Harbage characterized them in our

pages in 1956 as "eccentrics of the most familiar type--pathetic victims of the

idee fixe, or wealthy old gentlemen safely indulging a latent hunger to be

'radical' about something."<p>



<p>



The anti-Stratfordians are not discouraged, however, and during the past few

decades a solid majority of them have coalesced behind Edward de Vere

(1550-1604), the seventeenth Earl of Oxford, as the "onlie begetter" of the

Shakespeare canon. The Folger Shakespeare Library--a bastion of orthodoxy--last

April went so far as to invite Charles Vere, a descendant of the seventeenth

Earl of Oxford, to present the case for the earl before a packed audience in

the library's Great Hall.<p>



<p>



Because authorship debaters typically talk past one another, we allowed for a

two-stage process. We gave the writers here--each a learned and enthusiastic

partisan, one for the Earl of Oxford and the other for Shakespeare--the

opportunity to make his best case. Then each piece was sent to the opposing

writer for rebuttal. A brief look at computer-assisted investigations of the

authorship question follows this exchange.

	<font size=5>T</font>om Bethell's case for Oxford demonstrates once again that in the thousands of

works on Shakespeare and his plays, something can be found to support any

notion. It also demonstrates that, as usual, Oxfordians must often resort to

outdated scholarship to find support for their notions. Apparently, modern

scholarship is as discouraging to them as the contemporaneous records of

Shakespeare and his theater are treacherous.<p>



<p>



These problems are on display in Bethell's assertion that there is "abundant

evidence" to support the earlier dating of many plays. The dating of plays

after 1604, he writes, is merely a matter of "giving breathing space to

Stratfordian chronology," and he states that "perhaps as many as a dozen plays

were written before the Stratford man reached his thirty-first birthday," in

1595. Well, as Bethell himself notes, the Palladis Tamia of Francis Meres,

published three years later, gives a list of plays by Shakespeare, and the

total is still only a dozen. According to Oxfordians, Hamlet, King Lear, Henry

V, and The Winter's Tale, at the very least, had been written by this time, and

yet they do not appear on Meres's list. Where are they? Even if we give the

Oxfordians the benefit of the doubt and add these four plays to the ones on

Francis Meres's list, and then combine them all with every other Shakespeare

play that scholars acknowledge to have been written before 1598, that still

means that more than half of the thirty-eight plays attributed to Shakespeare

would have to have been written (or "revised") between that year and Oxford's

death six years later, in 1604. By then only twenty-three plays that are

certainly Shakespeare's had appeared in published editions or been mentioned in

printed sources. It doesn't seem like the Oxfordian chronology allows much

breathing room at all.<p>



<p>



It also lacks a logical trajectory. Only two of the works on Meres's list of

early plays--Richard II and Henry IV--are unquestionably works that have the

earmarks of Shakespeare's mature command of drama and dramatic poetry. We know

of references to nine plays written by Shakespeare during the period that ends

in 1604 other than those mentioned by Meres, and again, only one or two are of

high dramatic stature. By the time of Oxford's death, then, none but a handful

of Shakespeare's most accomplished works had been either mentioned in print or

published--quite a suggestive point in itself. But the main point is this: The

traditional Shakespearean chronology, which has the author living until 1616,

and places much of Shakespeare's best work after 1604, takes his artistic

development over time into account. The Oxfordian chronology, in contrast,

really offers nothing more than a confused redating of a scattering of plays.<p>



<p>



Bethell claims that the King's Men were attaching Shakespeare's name to plays

that he didn't write (for example, The London Prodigal and A Yorkshire Tragedy)

in order to sell them to printers--something he is sure that the real

playwright would not have allowed if he was still alive. This assertion is a

reiteration of that unshakable Oxfordian fallacy that the rights of authors

were recognized in Elizabethan-Stuart England. In fact authors had no rights.

And especially not in the eyes of the Stationers, a guild concerned only with

the rights of its printers and publishers. And there is every reason to believe

that some publishers took advantage of this, which is nearly certainly the case

with A Yorkshire Tragedy, registered to Thomas Pavier. He was also involved in

the publication of the falsely dated, falsely attributed Shakespeare volumes

printed in 1619, which possibly played a part in the King's Men's attempt to

have the Lord Chamberlain forbid publication of any of their plays. There is

absolutely nothing to support Bethell's accusation that the acting company was

involved in the printing of the books he mentions. Why should they have been?

At the time, they had at least a dozen unpublished plays that WERE by

Shakespeare.<p>



<p>



Another of the supposed mysteries mentioned by Bethell is the absence of an

author's name in the early quartos, as though this were a condition peculiar to

Shakespeare. Rather, it was so common that it was a major factor in the

attribution of Mucedorus, Fair Em, and The Merry Devil of Edmonton to

Shakespeare. A substantial number of plays were published anonymously, and when

catalogues of plays began to appear, in 1656, the compilers tried to find

authors for orphaned plays. In fact, occasionally they would find an author for

a play even if it already had one. For instance, although Thomas Heywood's name

appears on the title page of The Iron Age (1632), one compiler awarded this

play to Thomas Dekker. Needless to say, their methods weren't very exacting in

attributing anonymous plays. Thus The Revenger's Tragedy was probably assigned

to Cyril Tourneur on grounds no better than that he had written The Atheist's

Tragedy--but the former is now generally accepted as being by Thomas

Middleton.<p>



<p>



What is especially frustrating to Oxfordians, whose fundamental tenet is that a

country bumpkin could not have written the plays in which they perceive a man

of vast learning, is that they cannot find even one of Shakespeare's

contemporaries who agrees with them. Bethell blames Jonson for "spread[ing] the

idea that Shakespeare was nature's child"--but no one seems to have disputed

this. When someone did reply to Jonson's frequent reproaches of Shakespeare for

"want of Learning, and Ignorance of the Ancients," the reply was most

enlightening. The "ever-memorable John Hales is said to have told Jonson that

<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

"if Mr. Shakespear had not read the Ancients, he had likewise not stolen

anything from 'em (a fault the other [Jonson] made no Conscience of), and that

if he would produce any one Topic finely treated by any of them, he would

undertake to show something upon the same Subject at least as well written by

Shakespear."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



Hales's remarks reflect what Shakespeare was most often praised for in his own

age: his mastery of the language. This is heard even in Bethell's quote from

the poet William Barksted: "His song was worthy merit." Of course, Bethell

cites this as evidence that Shakespeare was in the past tense when the poem was

written, in 1607. What, then, of the 1611 epigram "To our English Terence, Mr.

Will. Shake-speare," in which the author, John Davies of Hereford, addressed

the dramatist in the present tense?<p>



<p>



But the epigram holds more of interest. Why should Davies have likened

Shakespeare to Terence? He probably intended to suggest nothing more than that

his contemporary's sense of language and style was akin to that of the Roman

dramatist from the second century B.C. The two men have taken on other

similarities since. Because Oxfordians are certain that a tradesman's son from

a nasty provincial town could not have written the plays of a Shakespeare, it

is worth noting that Terence was brought to Rome as a slave from Carthage, a

very unfashionable city in its age. What is even more striking is that in

Terence's lifetime, because of his lowly origins, it was rumored that his plays

were actually written by noblemen. It appears that Shakespeare's contemporaries

were more democratic-minded than Terence's. Or some of mine.<p>



<p>



Bethell does nothing to rebut Justice Stevens's criticism that "the Oxfordian

case suffers from not having a single, coherent theory." In fact, Bethell

offers still another Oxfordian variant on the role of "William Shakspere, of

Stratford," in the Oxford drama. First there is the familiar version; the

"front man" paid off to "ensure his return to that dreary community," where he

would be kept "out of sight so that his glaring disqualifications for the role

of the dramatist would not queer the game," in the words of Charlton Ogburn.

And now the variant: "Shakspere" endowed with a share in the Chamberlain's Men

and left to put his glaring disqualifications on constant display as a

"factotum and manager." While we anxiously await whatever story Oxfordians

eventually settle on, let's consider that both current versions concede that

Shakespeare was at some time a part of the London theater scene. Isn't it odd

that in an age when even monarchs and (if we are to believe Oxfordians) their

councillors were fair game for satire, there is not a hint that anyone sent up

the fellow who hung around the playhouses as not being the same man who wrote

those plays?<p>



<p>



Of course, Oxfordians are in total agreement that the praise of the earl for

comedy by George or Richard Puttenham, echoed by Meres, is an indication of his

virtuosity. But there is no reason whatsoever to believe that Puttenham or

Meres was referring to anything but the comedies written under Oxford's own

name. It is interesting what company Oxford keeps in The Arte of English

Poesie. He is paired with Richard Edwards in his facility for "Comedy and

Enterlude," just as "the Lord of Buckhurst [Thomas Sackville] and Master Edward

Ferrers...deserve the highest price" for tragedy. Not only are these men not

known to have written anything after 1580, but also they wrote in the highly

formal style that signified refined taste. There is no reason to doubt that

Oxford was right at home among them--and none would have been at home on the

popular stages. Furthermore, if the Oxfordian chronology is right, and his

popular plays were revised versions of court plays, then many of his histories

and tragedies had been written by 1589. But all we hear about from Puttenham is

Oxford's facility for comedy, and that is all we hear about in Palladis Tamia,

nine years later.<p>



<p>



Most of all, the case of the Oxfordians relies on what they perceive to be

stunning parallels between Oxford's life and Shakespeare's plays. Sometimes

this calls to mind nothing so much as Fluellen, the Welsh captain in Henry V,

who finds striking parallels between King Harry and "Alexander the Pig" ("is

not 'pig' great"), especially:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

"There is a river in Macedon, and there is also moreover a river at

Monmouth....'tis all one; 'tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers, and there

is salmons in both."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



For instance, Oxford had been to Italy, and Bethell finds scholarly support for

Shakespeare's familiarity with its topography. But somehow we find nothing of

its people in the plays set in Italy; Shakespeare's characters are always of

contemporary England. But Oxford's character was definitely influenced by his

Italian travels. Therefore, whereas Bethell discerns "Shakespeare's frequent

disgust with court life," it is curious to find the Duke of York in Richard II

complaining of the court's taste for the<p>



<p>



"Report of fashions in proud Italy, <p>



<p>



Whose manners still our tardy apish nation<p>



<p>



Limps after in base imitation."<p>



<p>



Historically, Richard's court aped the fashions of France. It was Elizabeth's

court where Italy was in fashion, and no one, perhaps, was more in this fashion

than the Earl of Oxford. Gabriel Harvey, a supposed admirer of the earl's,

wrote a poem that, according to Virginia F. Stern, in her biography of Harvey

(1979), "depicts with ridicule the attire and mannerisms of an Italianate

Englishman and was probably conceived as a veiled caricature of the Earl of

Oxford." In fact, John Lyly recognized Oxford's image in it and called it to

his patron's attention, purportedly in the hope of damaging Harvey's standing

with the earl.<p>



<p>



Which brings us to another issue that looms large in Oxfordian arguments:

Shakespeare's allegedly privileged knowledge of court life. As a player in an

acting company, Shakespeare was in the service, first, of the Lord Chamberlains

of the Household (who, as their title implies, were actively involved in court

life) and, second, of the King himself. Shakespeare would have been at court

frequently, not only as an actor but also as one of a company whose members,

under James I, were Grooms of the Chamber, attendant at state functions. It

would appear that Shakespeare had ample opportunity to pick up both firsthand

and secondhand knowledge of the court. After all, some of the most extensive

and intimate information we have of the doings in the court of England during

Shakespeare's lifetime is in the letters of John Chamberlain, a commoner with

an uncommonly wide circle of friends.<p>



<p>



Finally, Oxfordians would have us believe that the earl's last years are

shrouded in impenetrable obscurity because he was indulging in his guilty

passion. Those years turn out to be not so impenetrable that there isn't good

reason to believe that literature was by no means "his main interest in life."

What was his obsession from June of 1594, when the Chamberlain's Men was

formed, to March 15, 1595, when we first hear of Shakespeare's association with

the company? On March 20, 1595, Oxford wrote to Lord Burghley, "This last year

past, I have been a suitor to Her Majesty that I might farm her 'tins.'" One

year later tin still seems the subject that excites his Muse. And in June of

1599, when the Globe was just finished, or nearly so, Oxford was still harping

on tin. Curiously, in the enormous Shakespeare lexicon the word "tin" never

once appears.<p>



<p>



As it does not seem that there is much that partisans of Shakespeare and Oxford

can agree on, it is pleasant to close on a note of accord with Tom Bethell when

he calls attention to Sonnet 76 and its declaration<p>



<p>



"That every word doth almost tell my name, <p>



<p>



Showing their birth, and where they did proceed."<p>



<p>



We don't need an Oxfordian decoder (as Sonnet 76 does) to find a secret message

that reveals the author's name. Just turn to Sonnet 135, which begins, <p>



<p>



"Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy WILL,<p>



<p>



And WILL to boot, and WILL in over-plus."<p>



<p>



and ends with a sentiment a Shakespearean can regard fondly:<p>



<p>



"Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill;<p>



<p>



Think all but one, and me in that one WILL."

	<font size=5>T</font>HE great problem of the information age is that 

	there's too much information.

The easier it becomes to store any kind of data on a computer or to dump

material onto the Internet, the harder it can be to find what you are looking

for. As more people have exchanged E-mail, joined "newsgroups" and other online

discussion forums, and set up their own "home pages" on the World Wide Web, the

conventional wisdom has held that the computer age will be a time of

decentralized, truly democratic information flow. According to this theory,

editors and, say, government censors will no longer have the ability to filter,

select, or in other ways distort the news, because any citizen with a computer

and a modem will be able to prowl through the Internet's vast data troves and

find the truth.<p>



	<!--SEAHORSE ICON FOR RELATED ARTICLES-->

	

	<A HREF="compinx.htm"><img src="../../../images/shorsera.gif" align=left vspace=10 hspace=10 border=0 alt="(Related Articles)">

	

	</A>

	

 

Computers are obviously changing the way people communicate, and giving us

online friends and colleagues we have never met. Yet for the time being they

seem to be making editors and other data-winnowers more rather than less

important. Precisely because no one can keep up with all the discussion groups,

all the new Web sites, and all the online libraries, people who will do

preliminary screening and point others toward promising sites have an

increasingly valuable service to sell. Already the Internet teems with

recommendations for "hot lists" and "cool sites" and digests of the best

postings from various bulletin boards. The most popular online discussion

forums tend to be not purely democratic but quasi-authoritarian in spirit, with

an active "Sysop" (systems operator) who both steers and stimulates debate. <p>



The people performing such functions will not be quite like traditional print

editors--mainly because the act of reading on the Internet seems destined to

remain very different from reading a printed page. Reading from even the nicest

computer screen is so unpleasant--and the expectation is so strong that the

computer will always be doing something more active than just displaying

text--that computers will remain better suited to jumping from topic to topic

than to the sustained intellectual, artistic, or emotional experience that

print can provide. People can read books by the hour; it is hard to imagine

anyone's spending even ten minutes straight reading a single document on a

computer screen. Yet while editing standards for the screen may differ from

those for print, the basic editorial functions of selecting, highlighting, and

ordering remain important in the Web world. <p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE natural impulse of the computer culture is to look 

for ways to automate everything.  Software designers are now working on 

systems that might automatically edit the material that is being abundantly 

and automatically propagated.  In an article in last month's issue of this 

magazine ("<A 

HREF="../../96mar/java/java.htm">The 

Java Theory</A>") I discussed two computerized systems that can under 

certain circumstances be tremendously effective in finding data: the 

electronic version of the <i><A HREF="http://www.eb.com/">Encyclopaedia 

Britannica</A></i> and the <A 

HREF="http://lex-nex.openmarket.com/lexis-nexis/">Lexis-Nexis</A> database.  

Each has made the most of an unusual advantage.  The <i>Britannica</i>'s<i> 

</i>edge is its pre-existing <i><A 

HREF="http://www.eb.com/demo/prodemo.html">Propaedia</A></i>, a conceptual 

index to the encyclopedia's full contents.  The <i>Propaedia</i> makes it 

possible for electronic searching programs to look not just for specific 

names or phrases in the <i>Britannica</i> but for discussions of broad 

themes.  Lexis-Nexis has the advantage of standardization.  With 

transcripts of many newspaper and magazine articles, wire-service stories, 

and broadcast news programs that reach back as far as the early 1980s, all 

collected in one computer system, Lexis-Nexis allows researchers to find 

information even when they don't know where it originally appeared.<p>

 

The conditions that allow these two systems to work--a sophisticated index in

the <i>Britannica</i>'s case, a centralized data collection for

Lexis-Nexis--are conspicuously absent elsewhere on the Internet. Last December

the Digital Equipment Corporation unveiled its <A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com">Alta Vista</A> search system (found

at http://www.<br>altavista.digital.com), which searches for Web pages

containing particular phrases or names far more quickly than other search

systems such as <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</A> and <A HREF="http://webcrawler.com/">WebCrawler</A>. But to use even the ultra-high-speed Alta

Vista effectively you must know what you are looking for before you start. The

response to a general query, about an idea or trend, may point toward hundreds

of Web sites with no indication of which really has the data you want. <p>





			<img src="./computer.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 alt=""><p>



Recently, at two laboratories near Boston, I saw projects that were designed to

cope with the Internet's limitations and ultimately to make online data less of

a gimmick and more of a tool. One location was the famed <A HREF="http://www.media.mit.edu/">Media Lab at the

Massachusetts Institute of Technology</A>, founded in the mid-1980s and since then

the object of both admiration and suspicion in the computer business. The

admiration has been for the glamour of the lab's projects and the success of

its director, <A HREF="http://nicholas.www.media.mit.edu/people/nicholas/">Nicholas Negroponte</A>, in attracting both money and press

attention. The suspicion concerns whether the lab's self-consciously

"visionary" projects will turn out to have practical, profitable uses in the

long run--and if they do, where the profits will go. <p>



In the back of everyone's mind is the nightmare example of the <A HREF="http://www.parc.xerox.com/">Xerox PARC</A> lab

in Palo Alto. Through the 1970s Xerox PARC generated some of the most

influential ideas in computing, but almost none of them did Xerox any good. For

example, the concepts of the computer mouse and the graphical interface, now

nearly universal because of their application first in Apple products and then

in Windows, came from the Xerox lab but enriched other companies. <p>



I have no idea whether the tricks I saw when guided around the Media Lab by a

researcher named David Small will ever make it to market. For example, Small

demonstrated a work in progress that could be thought of as a very elaborate

way to avoid carrying business cards, or as an exploration of futuristic ways

to transmit information. This project, directed by MIT's <A HREF="http://physics.www.media.mit.edu/~neilg/">Neil Gershenfeld</A>, uses

shoes as computers and the human body as a network. Data could be stored in

computer chips in your shoes, and could travel to your fingertips through your

body, which can carry a small current. When you shook someone's hand, it would

be like making a modem connection: the computers in people's shoes could swap

basic information--fax number, E-mail address--with one another. Hmmmm. <p>



Small, an MIT graduate student who was wearing a T-shirt reading THINK SMALL,

works much of the time in a warehouselike room lit only by the glow of computer

screens--"to keep up my sallow complexion" (for a glimpse, see his Web site at

<A HREF="http://dsmall.www.media.mit.edu/people/dsmall/">http://www.media.mit. edu/~dsmall</A>). His main work area is a two-by-five-foot

Lego board covered with elaborate Lego structures. When he picked up a <A HREF="http://legowww.homepages.com/">Lego</A>

plane, complete with propeller, and started flying it <i>zoom</i>, <i>zoom</i>,

in the fashion of a four-year-old, my worries about the commercial prospects of

the Media Lab increased. In fact the plane was the housing for an advanced and

expensive position-sensing device, and as Small moved it, a large computer

screen showed the "world" (that is, the Lego structures) as it appeared from

the vantage point of the plane's nose. <p>



To my eye, the most enticing toys at the Media Lab were the products of the

<A HREF="http://vlw.www.media.mit.edu/groups/vlw/">Visible Language Workshop Project</A>, of which Small's Lego apparatus was just one

example. The Visible Language Project was created by Muriel Cooper, an MIT

graphic designer turned computer expert who was highly influential at the lab

until her death in 1994. Under her direction researchers attempted to use

computer graphics not as a substitute for text (the Macintosh-Windows approach)

but as a way of making text more meaningful. This can be seen as merely an

extension of the centuries-old evolution of typography, in which varying fonts

and type sizes enhance the meaning of printed words. Yet the tools of modern

computing can make it look like a major evolutionary leap. <p>



The dozen or so examples Small and his colleague <A HREF="http://ullmer.www.media.mit.edu/people/ullmer/">Brygg Ullmer</A> showed me were

all intriguing, including Small's own project allowing users to cruise through

the complete works of Shakespeare--or the Bible, or other vast texts--as if

they were piloting a spaceship through a galaxy. Two projects in particular

made me wish that I were a venture capitalist who could put them into effect.

One, conceived by <A HREF="http://rennison.www.media.mit.edu/people/rennison/">Earl Rennison</A>, is called the Galaxy of News. It starts out on

the computer screen with what looks like a view of several distant nebulae. As

you use the mouse to move closer to these star clusters, they turn out to be

large subject areas--government, sports, entertainment, and so on. As you near

one of these areas, tiny rays appear, leading to subtopics--local politics,

national politics, foreign affairs, and so on. The farther you move in any

direction, the more refined the topics become, until at last the rays lead to a

variety of headlines from relevant articles. This may sound unendurably

gimmicky --and the whole experience was reminiscent of a <i><A HREF="http://www.htwm.de/%7Emirmisch/star-trek.html">Star Trek</A></i>

scene. But speaking as one who has bragged about being skeptical of graphics

and preferring just words, I found this enhancement powerful and natural--much

quicker to make sense of, for example, than a long list of article titles

produced by a Nexis search. <p>



A less flamboyant but equally appealing system was Highway News, created by a

woman named Yin Yin Wong. As you look at your computer screen, you seem to be

flying at low altitude above a flat midwestern plain marked with billboards

announcing different topics--sports, corporate news, and so on. If you descend

to get a closer look, you can see the names of subtopics behind each billboard,

and then the articles you're looking for. Again, this may sound obtrusive, but

I can imagine using it for research.<p>

 

<font size=5>T</font>HESE and other Visible Language products are all exploring how to display

information. The idea is that some automatic indexing system will sort and link

articles, assigning them to the right galaxy or billboard area. The need for

such a product might seem to bring us back to the original problem of the

Internet--that its information, unlike that of the <i>Encyclopaedia

Britannica</i>, is not already indexed. I prefer to think that it leads instead

to the East Coast laboratories of Sun Microsystems, in Chelmsford,

Massachusetts, where an ambitious project to create an automatic "conceptual

indexer" is under way. <p>



The principal investigator of Sun's indexing project, <A HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/conferences/www95/woods.html">William Woods</A>, has worked

for nearly thirty years in the realm where mathematics, formal logic, and

linguistics intersect. People from each of these disciplines have attempted to

create abstract models of how human language works, along with specific models

of the structural and semantic quirks of specific languages. The goal has

generally been to create "expert systems" that can mimic human understanding in

fields ranging from petroleum geology to the interpretation of x-rays. In

addition, this research has been applied in "natural-language

interfaces"--which would, for example, allow you to ask a computer, "How much

tax do I owe this year?" and have it calculate the answer. <p>



Natural-language systems, as a rule, don't work well. You have to learn to talk

like a computer if you want them to understand you; if you slip into the gappy,

unpredictable style that real people use when they speak, the computer gets

confused. The classic illustration of the tangles of real language is the

<A HREF="http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/~izzo/marx.html">Groucho Marx</A> line "Time flies like an arrow, but fruit flies like a banana."<p>



Rather than attempting to create a full natural-language system, the Sun

indexing project has attempted to develop a computer program "smart" enough to

categorize new information it encounters. One of the project's fundamental

concepts is that the words in the English language (and the things or ideas

they represent) fit together in a "kind of" relationship: a salmon is a kind of

fish, a fish is a kind of animal, and an animal is a kind of living thing.

Therefore, when a computer found the word "salmon" in a passage, it would know

for indexing purposes that the passage concerned not just salmon but also fish,

animals, and living things. <p>



It would take hundreds of thousands of such hierarchical rules to account for

the meanings in the English language, with its notorious ambiguities and

nuances. Yet Woods says that his team at Sun has found that they can produce a

useful indexer with a relatively smaller number of such facts. A recent version

of their system contained 34,000 individual "kind of" relationships. Apart from

tracing the hierarchies themselves, the team's work has involved countless

fine-tuning steps--for instance, helping the indexer to recognize that although

"intend"is related to "mean,"and "mean"is related to "cruel,""intend" and

"cruel" are not related terms. Similarly, the system must be ready to

distinguish between "standard" as an adjective meaning "normal" and "standard"

as a noun meaning "criterion" or even "flag." It has rules for boiling down

words to their root meanings, and for recognizing how those meanings are

changed by prefixes like "un-" and "dis-" or suffixes like "-able" and "-ent."

And on and on. <p>



On and on might seem to stretch toward infinity: the program requires rules to

allow for special cases and then rules to offset the errors those produce.

Indeed, when I tried a working model of the system in Sun's offices, half a

dozen glitches showed up in ten minutes. Several dozen magazine articles and

radio transcripts by one writer had been fed into the machine, which had then

attempted to index individual sentences for their meaning. A few mistakes were

obvious. It indexed several references to South America, but it had never been

taught that Brazil belonged in that category. It listed a number of references

to foodstuffs, with the frequently occurring subcategory "ale." Since I had

written the articles in question and didn't remember ever mentioning ale, I

went to the sentences involved and found that they all contained the word

"reality." The program was smart enough to know that "ale" was a kind of food,

that "re-" was a prefix, and that "-ity" was a suffix for root words ending in

<i>e</i>, but no one had ever told it that "reality" is not something you can

drink. <p>



Still, these were exceptions. I was less impressed by the failures than by how

many sensible judgments the indexing system had made. Unlike computerized

systems for translating one language into another, which often produce

gibberish or ridiculous sentences, when the indexer failed it failed

gracefully. It gave a number of clues for finding information, so that if one

was misleading, the others would get me there. At all times it let me observe

and second-guess the structure of its logic. If I was looking for references to

"aphasia," which it considered a kind of speech problem, it would show me

references to discussions of other kinds of speech problems, in case these had

information I sought. <p>



"When will this be ready?" I asked eagerly after my test drive. Wood and his

associates looked uneasily at one another and said, "Soon, we hope." When I

asked whether I would eventually be able to run the system on my home machine,

they laughed at me. One said, "We can barely make it run on ours"--a

supercruiser-style Sun workstation. Then I realized that this system, like the

Visible Language Workshop entertainments, doesn't have to fit on your home

machine. It was meant to be applied to the data resources of the Internet,

giving us a way to survey, map, and settle that frontier.

	"When I was a child, I spake as a child," Saint Paul wrote. I see no

harm in it if kids use the current kid dialect when talking with other kids, or

even in casual conversation with you, as long as they can also demonstrate a

command of Standard English when, say, lunching with Grandmother. David ought

to be able to manage that relatively minor attainment. Children's capacity for

language is in fact awesome. When Charles Berlitz, of Berlitz Publishing and

what is now known as the Berlitz Language Center, was a small boy, his father

spoke to him in English, his mother in French, his grandfather in German, and

his aunts and cousins in Spanish--and he learned to converse with everyone. All

the same, imagine little Charles's relief, on his first day of school, when he

realized that he wasn't going to have to learn a new language to communicate

with each of the other children in his class. He was also, according to later

reports, surprised and saddened to discover that most of those other children

spoke nothing but English.<p><p>

	Your letter was one of the more polite among many written to, ahem,

inquire about my sentence "Tradition . . . is <i>the</i> only <i>reason why</i>

. . ." There's no doubt that, for example, "Tell me <i>the reason why</i> you

cried, and <i>the reason why</i> you lied to me" would be better the way the

Beatles sang it--with four fewer words. And yet <i>the reason why </i>is no

more redundant than <i>the person who</i> or <i>the place where</i>. In

sentences, therefore, that one is tempted to "correct" by simply substituting

<i>that</i> for <i>why</i>, why bother? Whether <i>the reason why</i> is a

waste of words is always worth thinking about, but sometimes the answer is

no.<p>

	<font size = 5>I</font><i> have asked this question of friends both savvy and otherwise, and have

received nothing but puzzled looks in reply: For how long after a person's

death is he or she referred to in speech and print as "The </i>late . . . <i>"?

<i>President Nixon" and John Fitzgerald Kennedy called "the </i>late<i>

	I can even show you references to "the <i>late</i> George Washington":

"the sort of observance normally set aside to commemorate the birth dates of

the <i>late</i> George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King,

Jr." (<i>American Spectator</i>) and "belatedly paying Alaska's respects to the

<i>late</i> George Washington" (<i>Washington Post</i>). In these contexts

<i>late</i> is silly. We all know that President Washington is dead. In fact,

as is clear from the preponderance of uses of <i>late</i> in the media, what

readers or hearers can be expected to know is the point. <i>Late </i>turns up

where people are likely to need a little nudge to recall that the person in

question has died. Where context, or simply people's pre-existing mental

furnishings, can be relied on to provide the information, <i>late</i> is

pointless; that's why it rarely appears in obituaries. I can, though, imagine

situations in which "the <i>late</i> George Washington" would be apropos.

Here's one: "In 1800 the reputation of the <i>late</i> George Washington was .

. . " Even if we can all be expected to know that Washington is long gone, we

might be grateful for a hint about how early he left.<p>

							<!--SINGLE-SPACE POEMS USING br NOT P-->

	

She heard the nasty scraping of sole and heel<br>

against the clipped turf of the doormat;<br>

then their neighbor rushed in,<br>

just back from the hospital,<br>

where everything was fine, she said.<br>

Fine. Her son had to spend the night<br>

for observation, that was all.<br>

He had been grazed by a delivery van<br>

while crossing the street on his bike.<br>

A few bruises, a superficial wound<br>

above one knee. Incredible luck.<br>

The neighbor was still wearing<br>

her jogging clothes--pale blue<br>

ripstop nylon, the same blue flame<br>

along the instep of her running shoes.<br>

She slid a chair from underneath<br>

the kitchen table and sat down,<br>

her long legs straight in front of her<br>

like a ladder to a different world.<br>

It was when the neighbor answered "yes"<br>

to a question the woman's husband<br>

had not yet asked<br>

that the woman finally understood.<br>

Her husband had not even mentioned eggs,<br>

but the neighbor knew he was going to cook for her.<br>

How many times had they eaten together,<br>

the woman watching wondered. Enough.<br>

Her husband worked slowly,<br>

strolling back and forth between the stove,<br>

the coffee maker, and the table<br>

where his wife and the still-flushed neighbor<br>

leaned on their elbows discussing<br>

the hazards of dusk.<br>

On the counter, the eggs<br>

developed little caps of moisture.<br>

Her husband put lots of butter<br>

in the pan and popped the toaster manually<br>

before the toast could burn.<br>

At long last he broke the eggs.<br>

She had never seen him<br>

do it like this before, two-handed.<br>

He always liked to show off<br>

by breaking the eggs with one hand.<br>

This evening<br>

his hands were trembling<br>

as he cracked the eggs<br>

on the skillet's rim, hurrying to slide<br>

the whole brimming mess into the pan<br>

to quiet the sizzling fat.<p>

</font>O two negotiations for the sale of a child are alike, but all are founded on

the pretense that the parties involved have the best interests of the child at

heart. On this sweltering morning in the Punjab village of Wasan Pura a carpet

master, Sadique, is describing for a thirty-year-old brick worker named Mirza

the advantages his son will enjoy as an apprentice weaver. "I've admired your

boy for several months," Sadique says. "Nadeem is bright and ambitious. He will

learn far more practical skills in six months at the loom than he would in six

years of school. He will be taught by experienced craftsmen, and his pay will

rise as his skills improve. Have no doubt, your son will be thankful for the

opportunity you have given him, and the Lord will bless you for looking so well

after your own." <p>

Sadique has given this speech before. Like many manufacturers, he recruits

children for his workshop almost constantly, and is particularly aggressive in courting boys aged seven to ten.

"They make ideal employees," he says. "Boys at this stage of development are at

the peak of their dexterity and endurance, and they're wonderfully

obedient--they'd work around the clock if I asked them." But when pressed he

admits, "I hire them first and foremost because they're economical. For what

I'd pay one second-class adult weaver I can get three boys, sometimes four, who

can produce first-class rugs in no time."<p>



The low cost of child labor gives Sadique and his fellow manufacturers a

significant advantage in the Western marketplace, where they undersell their

competitors from countries prohibiting child labor, often by improbable

amounts. Not surprisingly, American and European consumers are attracted to

low-price, high-quality products, and imports of child-made carpets from

Pakistan have trebled in the past two decades. Pakistan's carpet makers have

satisfied this surging demand by expanding production at existing factories and

opening new ones wherever they can. To maximize their returns, virtually all

these factories employ children, and an increasing number do so exclusively.

Somewhere between 500,000 and one million Pakistani children aged four to

fourteen now work as full-time carpet weavers. UNICEF believes that they make

up 90 percent of the carpet makers' work force.<p>



Sadique delivers his speech at volume and accompanies it with an assortment of

gestures--nods, waves, raised eyebrows--that are as theatrical as they are out

of place in his shambles of a workshop. He concludes with a smile and, just in

case Mirza does not appreciate his generosity, adds a wistful coda: "I wish my

father had given me such an opportunity." Mirza seems doubtful, perhaps because

his son is seven years old, perhaps because he has seen too many of his

neighbors' children suffer through similar opportunities. But he returns

Sadique's smile and says in a faint voice that he hopes Nadeem will learn

enough to work one day as a journeyman weaver or, better still, to open a

workshop of his own.<p>



Whatever misgivings Mirza has at the moment are overshadowed by his poverty,

which is extreme and worsening. He supports a family of five by working at a

nearby kiln, molding bricks by hand for up to eighty hours a week. The work

pays poorly at the best of times, and on occasion it does not pay at all. Three

weeks earlier a monsoon destroyed several thousand unfired bricks that had been

left drying on factory grounds. The kiln owner held the workers accountable for

the damage and refused to pay them for the two weeks they had spent making the

bricks. The "fine," as the owner called it, proved ruinous. Already months

behind on their rent and in debt to the village merchants, Mirza and his wife

concluded that the only way to avoid eviction was to bond their eldest child to

one of the district's manufacturers. Sadique was their first choice: he was

prosperous, his workshop was near their home, and he was rumored to have an

urgent need for child laborers, which they believed would translate into a high

price for Nadeem.<p>



They were half right. The workshop has a perpetual need for children, but

Sadique is unwilling to pay a premium for them. For that matter, he is

unwilling to pay market rates. Having dispensed with the niceties, he offers

Mirza 5,000 rupees ($146) for five years of his son's labor. It's a paltry

sum--roughly two months' earnings for an adult weaver. Mirza was expecting an

offer at least three times as high. "Business is off this year," Sadique says,

by way of preempting Mirza's objections. "When things improve, I may be able to

give you another two or three hundred. Many fathers would be glad to get half

this amount."<p>



Mirza is distressed. He is a small man, stooped and wasted from his years at

the kiln, his skin and tunic flecked with soot. Like most laborers, he is

acutely aware of his caste, and in the presence of those whom he deems his

betters is deferential to the point of abjectness. Bravely he asks Sadique for

another thousand rupees, though he couches the request in the most

self-deprecating terms he knows. "Sir, my family's survival depends on your

charity. You will always be remembered in our prayers as our savior from

beggary and destitution." To his relief, Sadique agrees at once, extending a

manicured hand with a speed that suggests he was prepared to pay more and got a

bargain. In any event, he can afford to be generous. The money he offers Mirza,

called a <i>peshgi</i>, will be paid in installments, and he will deduct from

it all costs associated with Nadeem's maintenance and training. Many of the

deductions are contrived and inflated. Parents are charged for their children's

food and tools, the raw materials they use, the errors they make, the amount of

time the master spends "educating" them. Throughout Pakistan parents consider

themselves fortunate if at the end of their child's service the master has paid

them one third of the <i>peshgi</i>.<p>



Mirza is unaware of these deductions and, eager to make his escape, does not

ask questions that might complicate the proceedings. He consummates the deal by

shaking Sadique's hand (after wiping his own on his tunic) and accepting from

him a first installment of 200 rupees. The parties are bound only by their

word: no contracts are signed; no witnesses are present. "Your boy now belongs

to me," Sadique says as Mirza pockets the banknotes. "Please understand that so

long as he works under my roof he is answerable only to me. Inform him that the

needs of my shop take priority over those of his family, and he must do all he

can to please me. If he does not, we will all be disappointed, him most of

all." Mirza thanks the master for his kindness, bows low, and runs off to relay

this information to his son.

<h3><B>An Inexhaustible Labor Pool</B>

</h3>

 <font size=5>C</font>HILD labor has assumed epidemic proportions in Pakistan. Statistics are

unreliable, but the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) last year

estimated the number of Pakistani working children to be "realistically in the

region of 11-12 million." At least half these children are under the age of

ten. Despite a recent series of laws prohibiting child labor and indentured

servitude, children make up a quarter of the unskilled work force, and can be

found in virtually every factory, every workshop, every field. They earn on

average a third of the adult wage. Certain industries, notably carpet making

and brick making, cannot survive without them. One World Bank economist

maintains that Pakistan's economic viability correlates with the number of

children in its factories. The child labor pool is all but inexhaustible, owing

in part to a birth rate that is among the world's highest and to an education

system that can accommodate only about a third of the country's school-age

children. Each year millions of children enter the labor force, where they

compete with adults--often even with their parents--for what little work is

available. In many regions the surplus of cheap child labor has depressed the

already inadequate adult wage to the point where a parent and child together

now earn less than the parent alone earned a year ago. As long as children are

put to work, poverty will spread and standards of living will continue to

decline.<p>



To be sure, child labor is an institution throughout the Third World, and its

incidence has been increasing in countries that are usually described as

advanced. The worldwide population of children under fourteen who work

full-time is thought to exceed 200 million. But few countries have done less to

abolish or to contain the practice than Pakistan. And fewer still have a ruling

class that opposes workplace reform and human-rights initiatives as vigorously.

Given its relative prosperity, its constitutional prohibition against child

labor, and its leaders' signatures on every UN human- and child-rights

convention, Pakistan's de facto dependency on child labor is troubling and to

its critics inexcusable.<p>



"Inaction speaks louder than words," says I. A. Rehman, the director of the

HRCP. "This government is in continuous violation of the Convention on the

Rights of the Child, and has consistently refused to enforce those very laws it

enacted to protect its most vulnerable citizens. We have far more in the way of

resources and legal remedies than China, India, and Indonesia, and we do far

less for our young than they. The problem is lack of political will. The

problem is greed."<p>



The median age of children now entering the Pakistani work force is seven. Two

years ago it was eight. Two years from now it may be six. In the lowest castes,

children become laborers almost as soon as they can walk. Much of the nation's

farmland is worked by toddlers, yoked teams of three-, four-, and five-year-olds who plough, seed, and glean fields from dawn to dusk.

On any given morning the canal banks and irrigation ditches in rural villages

are lined with urchins who stand no taller than the piles of laundry they wash

for their wealthier neighbors. Even the world-class industries of Islamabad,

the modern capital, are staffed in large part by children and adolescents;

politicians traveling to the National Assembly can't help noticing the ragged

youths entering and exiting the brick factories, steel mills, and

stone-crushing plants at all hours of the day and night. These children work

with a minimum of adult supervision. An overseer comes by periodically to mark

their progress and to give them instructions or a few encouraging blows, but

for the better part of the workday they are left to themselves. "Children are

cheaper to run than tractors and smarter than oxen," explains one Rawalpindi

landowner. He prefers field hands between seven and ten years old, "because

they have the most energy, although they lack discipline."<p>



In rural areas children are raised without health care, sanitation, or

education; many are as starved for affection as for food. As soon as they're

old enough to have an elementary understanding of their circumstances, their

parents teach them that they are expected to pay their way, to make sacrifices,

and, if necessary, to travel far from home and live with strangers. "When my

children were three, I told them they must be prepared to work for the good of

the family," says Asma, a Sheikhupura villager who bonded her five children to

masters in distant villages. "I told them again and again that they would be

bonded at five. And when the time came for them to go, they were prepared and

went without complaint."<p>



Bonding is common practice among the lower castes, and although the decision to

part with their children is not made lightly, parents do not agonize over it.

Neither, evidently, do the children, who regard bonding as a rite of passage,

the event that transforms them into adults. Many look forward to it in the same

way that American children look forward to a first communion or getting a

driver's license. They are eager to cast off childhood, even if to do so means

taking on adult burdens. Irfana, a twelve-year-old schoolgirl who spent four

years as a brick worker before she was freed by an anti-slavery organization,

remembers feeling relieved when her father handed her over at age six to a kiln

owner. "My friends and I knew that sooner or later we'd be sent off to the

factories or the fields. We were tired of doing chores and minding infants. We

looked forward to the day when we'd be given responsibilities and the chance to

earn money. At the time work seemed glamorous and children who worked seemed

quite important."<p>



She soon learned otherwise. "For the masters, bonded children are a commodity.

My master bought, sold, and traded us like livestock, and sometimes he shipped

us great distances. The boys were beaten frequently to make them work long

hours. The girls were often violated. My best friend got ill after she was

raped, and when she couldn't work, the master sold her to a friend of his in a

village a thousand kilometers away. Her family was never told where she was

sent, and they never saw her again."<p>



Early in this decade the Pakistan National Assembly enacted two labor laws

meant to curb such practices. The first, The Employment of Children Act of

1991, prohibited the use of child labor in hazardous occupations and

environments. The second, The Bonded Labor Act of 1992, abolished indentured

servitude and the <i>peshgi </i>system. As progressive as these laws were, the

government failed to provide for their implementation and enforcement. It also

neglected to inform the millions of working children and indentured servants

that they were free and released from their debts. "We prefer to leave

enforcement to the discretion of the police," says a Ministry of Labor

official. "They understand best the needs of their community. Law is not an

absolute. We must expect a certain flexibility on the part of those who enforce

it. Could this sometimes mean looking the other way? Absolutely."

<h3>

<a name="RTFToC3">A Diminutive Entrepreneur</a></h3>

<font size=5>T</font>HE farther authorities are from a major city in Pakistan, the less likely they

are to pursue violators of the child-labor laws. To leave Lahore, the nation's

intellectual and commercial center, is to enter a land populated and run by

children. The change is as abrupt as it is extreme. The roads just beyond the

city limits are congested with donkey carts, all of them driven by teamsters of

eight or nine. Boys seem to have a monopoly on roadside attractions: gas

stations, auto-repair centers, restaurants. When I pull into the Star Petroleum

station on the Ferozpur Road, five miles from Lahore, three boys rush out of

the garage to service my car. They are twelve, eight, and seven, and wear

uniforms intended for men twice their size. The eldest has rolled up his pants

and sleeves, but his colleagues helplessly trail theirs in the dirt. While the

older boys fill my tank with a rusted hand pump, the youngest climbs onto the

hood and cleans the windshield with a dangling sleeve. When I pull away, the

boys rush back to the garage and to a diesel engine they are attempting to

rebuild between fill-ups. No adults are visible on the premises.<p>



Adults are also in short supply at the crossroads markets that provide

villagers with everything from prayer mats to surgical instruments. Twelve of

the fifteen stands at the Tohkar Road market are managed by children under

fourteen. The fruit stand is run by a tyrannical eight-year-old boy and his

four- and five-year-old sisters. The boy spends his morning slicing melons with

a knife half his size, while behind him the girls sort cartloads of fruit. At

the next stall two eleven-year-old cousins fashion sandals out of discarded

tires. They work from dawn to dusk six days a week, and make more than 1,200

pairs each week. Behind the last stall another boy is struggling to unload a

stack of carpets from his donkey cart. He weighs seventy pounds. The twenty-odd

carpets in his cart weigh sixty pounds apiece, and it takes him ten minutes of

yanking, hefting, and cursing to get each one into the stall. The stall's

proprietor watches him with interest, but his concern is strictly for the

merchandise. He is a tall, heavyset forty-year-old who looks as if he could

unload the entire cart in fifteen minutes without breaking a sweat. But he

makes no move to help the boy, and seems to regard his exertions as routine. So

do the passersby. And, for that matter, so does the boy.<p>



His name is Faiz. A lively nine-year-old, he has been working as a hauler since

he was six. He attended school for two years, but dropped out when an elderly

neighbor offered him an advantageous lease on the cart and donkey. He runs the

business alone, and spends his days scrounging for hauling jobs and shuttling

produce, scrap metal, and crafts around six villages. He averages sixty miles a

week--no easy feat with a donkey that trots at three miles an hour. "The work

is painful and the days are long, but I earn enough to feed myself and tend the

donkey," Faiz says with an entrepreneur's pride. The key to his success is

underbidding the competition; his rates are a tenth of his predecessor's. "It

is reasonable that people should pay me less. My equipment is the same as an

adult's, but I am small and have a fraction of an adult's strength. I take

longer to make deliveries, so I must charge less. My hope is that the more

goods I move, the stronger I will get and the more I can charge."<p>



Soon after I arrived in Pakistan, I arranged a trip to a town whose major

factories were rumored to enslave very young children. I found myself hoping

during the journey there that the children I saw working in fields, on the

roads, at the marketplaces, would prepare me for the worst. They did not. No

amount of preparation could have lessened the shock and revulsion I felt on

entering a sporting-goods factory in the town of Sialkot, seventy miles from

Lahore, where scores of children, most of them aged five to ten, produce soccer

balls by hand for forty rupees, or about $1.20, a day. The children work eighty

hours a week in near-total darkness and total silence. According to the

foreman, the darkness is both an economy and a precautionary measure;

child-rights activists have difficulty taking photographs and gathering

evidence of wrongdoing if the lighting is poor. The silence is to ensure

product quality: "If the children speak, they are not giving their complete

attention to the product and are liable to make errors." The children are

permitted one thirty-minute meal break each day; they are punished if they take

longer. They are also punished if they fall asleep, if their workbenches are

sloppy, if they waste material or miscut a pattern, if they complain of

mistreatment to their parents or speak to strangers outside the factory. A

partial list of "infractions" for which they may be punished is tacked to a

wall near the entrance. It's a document of dubious utility: the children are

illiterate. Punishments are doled out in a storage closet at the rear of the

factory. There, amid bales of wadding and leather, children are hung upside

down by their knees, starved, caned, or lashed. (In the interests of economy

the foreman uses a lash made from scrap soccer-ball leather.) The punishment

room is a standard feature of a Pakistani factory, as common as a lunchroom at

a Detroit assembly plant.<p>



The town's other factories are no better, and many are worse. Here are brick

kilns where five-year-olds work hip-deep in slurry pits, where adolescent girls

stoke furnaces in 160 degree heat. Here are tanneries where nursing mothers mix

vats of chemical dye, textile mills where eight-year-olds tend looms and

breathe air thick with cotton dust.<p>



When confronted with questions from a foreigner about their use of child labor,

industrialists respond in one of two ways: they attack the questioner or they

deliver a lengthy lecture about the role of children in Pakistan's development.

The attacks are not always verbal. Last June a Norwegian trade-union delegation

was attacked at the Sialkot sporting-goods factory by three or four armed men

who were believed to work for the factory's owner. The delegation's guide and

cameraman were severely beaten and the latter required hospitalization. The

police characterized the attackers as "civic-minded" and warned the delegation

against inspecting other area factories and "unnecessarily antagonizing factory

owners."<p>



More common, though, is the industrialist who ushers the foreign investigator

into his office, plies him with coffee and cake, and tells him in his

friendliest manner that child labor is a tradition the West cannot understand

and must not attempt to change. "Our country has historically suffered from a

labor shortage, a deficit of able-bodied men," says Imran Malik, a prominent

Lahore carpet exporter and the vice-chairman of the Pakistan Carpet

Manufacturers and Exporters Association. "Children have compensated for this

shortage. They have worked when adults could not. They have helped construct

Pakistan's infrastructure and advanced its industry. For thousands of years

children have worked alongside their parents in their villages. The work they

now do in factories and workshops is an extension of this tradition, and in

most ways an improvement on it. The children earn more than they would

elsewhere. They contribute significantly to their family's security and raise

their standard of living."<p>



The industrialist's argument is accurate only in its assertion that Pakistani

children have traditionally worked with their families. But children seldom

worked <i>outside </i>the family until the 1960s, when the Islamic Republic

made a dramatic effort to expand its manufacturing base. This led to a

spectacular and disproportionately large increase in the number of children

working outside the home, outside the village, at factories and workshops whose

owners sought to maximize profits by keeping down labor costs. The rise in

child abuse was as meteoric as the rise in child labor. The children working in

these factories were beyond the reach or care of their families and were

increasingly the victims of industrial accidents, kidnapping, and mistreatment.

<h3>

<a name="RTFToC5">A Mixed Curse

</a></h3>

 <font size=5>"I</font>F employers would apply as much ingenuity to their manufacturing processes

as they do to evading labor laws, we'd have no child-labor problem," says

Najanuddin Najmi, the director general of the Workers Education Program, a

government agency. "There's little doubt that inexpensive child labor has

fueled Pakistan's economic growth. Entire industries have relocated to Pakistan

because of the abundance of cheap child labor and our lax labor laws. At the

same time, child labor has hindered our industrial development, especially in

the use of advanced technologies. Why should a manufacturer invest in

labor-saving technology when labor-intensive mechanisms are so much cheaper? We

are discovering more and more factories that have been redesigned and retooled

so that only children can work there."<p>



Child labor has been a mixed curse for all of southern Asia, expanding its

industrial capacity while generating an unprecedented assortment of social

problems. Not surprisingly, Pakistan's leaders are of two minds on the subject.

Speaking officially, they deplore the practice and have nothing but pity for

the roughly 11 million children working in factories, in fields, and on the

streets. Speaking pragmatically, they regard the practice as a distasteful but

unavoidable part of an emerging economy which time and prosperity will end.

They are quick to take offense (and quicker to take the offensive) when

human-rights activists suggest that they have ignored the problem.<p>



"Westerners conveniently forget their own shameful histories when they come

here," says Shabbir Jamal, an adviser to the Ministry of Labor. "Europeans

addressed slavery and child labor only after they became prosperous.

Pakistan has only now entered an era of economic stability that will allow us

to expand our horizons and address social concerns. Just as we are catching up

with the West in industrial development, so we are catching up in workplace and

social reforms. We are accelerating the pace of reform and have resolved to

create viable welfare and educational structures that will eradicate child

labor in the foreseeable future."<p>



Foreseeable may be a long way off. At the moment Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto

seems more interested in outfitting her army than in reforming Pakistani

society; her government has embarked on an ambitious military buildup that has

already imperiled the region. Its first victims have been Pakistan's lower

castes, the working poor who are accustomed to receiving little in the way of

social services and must now make do with less. In 1994 military spending was

240 percent as high as spending on health and education combined; the disparity

is expected to widen in years to come. Spending on education remains among the

world's lowest. Only 37 percent of Pakistan's 25 million school-age children

complete primary school--as compared with a world average of 79 percent and a

South Asian average of approximately 50 percent. By the year 2000 less than a

third of Pakistani children will attend school. The rest will enter the work

force or become beggars.<p>



Behind these statistics lurks an unpleasant truth: despite its modern views on

warfare and industrialization, Pakistan remains a feudal society, committed to

maintaining traditions that over the centuries have served its upper castes

well. The lords--factory owners, exporters, financiers--reflexively oppose any

reforms that might weaken their authority, lower their profit margins, or

enfranchise the workers. "There is room for improvement in any society," the

industrialist Imram Malik says. "But we feel that the present situation is

acceptable the way it is. The National Assembly must not rush through reforms

without first evaluating their impact on productivity and sales. Our position

is that the government must avoid so-called humanitarian measures that harm our

competitive advantages." On those rare occasions when a reform does squeak

through, the backlash is fierce. For example, when the legislature last year

approved a modest tax on bricks to fund an education program, brick-kiln owners

staged a ten-day nationwide protest and threatened to suspend production,

crippling construction, until the tax was repealed. Trade associations have

used similar strong-arm tactics to fight minimum-wage legislation,

occupational-safety regulations, and trade-union activity.<pre>

<h3>

<a name="RTFToC6">"The Charter of Freedom"

</a></h3>

<font size=5>W</font>ITH a government that is at best ambivalent about social issues and an

industrial sector resistant to workplace reform, the task of abolishing child

labor has fallen to the human-rights community</A>. But in a country where

corruption is pervasive and education scarce, social activists are everyone's

natural enemy. The ruling class despises them for assaulting its profitable

traditions. The lower castes suspect them of ulterior motives. (Laborers are

forever asking activists, "Why would an educated man trouble himself with the

poor?") Consequently, activists are frequent targets of slander, police

harassment, and lawsuits. They are beaten just as frequently, and on occasion

they are killed.<p>



Yet they persist, and sometimes they prevail. If human-rights organizations are

judged by the number of people they have helped, the Bonded Labor Liberation

Front is probably the most successful in Pakistan. Since its founding, in 1988,

the BLLF has led the fight against bonded and child labor, liberating 30,000

adults and children--frequently entire families--from brick kilns, carpet

factories, and farms, and placing 11,000 children in its own primary school

system (its motto: "Struggle against slavery through education"). At the same

time, it has won 25,000 high-court cases against abusive and unscrupulous

employers, and helped to push the recent labor legislation through the National

Assembly.<p>



"Our victories amount to a hardship," says Ehsan Ulla Khan, the BLLF's founder

and guiding force. "The state has done nothing to enforce the anti-slavery laws

or even to inform the public that child and bonded labor have been outlawed.

It's evident that if the enslaved workers are to be delivered from bondage,

private citizens will have to do the delivering. That is, we will have to

proclaim the end of slavery, educate workers, monitor employer compliance, and

take legal action when necessary, because the state lacks the will and

resources to do so."<p>



With little funding, the BLLF wages a two-front war against enterprises that

use child and bonded labor. While its legal advisers engage the courts and the

legislature, its field staff shuttles around the country, informing workers of

their recently acquired rights and distributing a pamphlet known as "The

Charter of Freedom," which enumerates those rights in simple language. If a

bonded laborer--child or adult--asks for its help, the BLLF takes whatever legal

action is necessary to secure his or her release. <p>



These days a surprising number of workers are refusing the pamphlet and turning

their backs on BLLF staff members. This is an expression less of ingratitude

than of fear. Employers throughout Pakistan are cautioning their workers

against consorting with reformers who spread "false rumors" about the end of

bonded labor. Many workers have been threatened with dismissal or violence if

they speak with "the abolitionists" or are caught with "illegal communist

propaganda."<p>



So effective is the factory owners' disinformation campaign that workers

literally flee when approached by BLLF staff members. This happened recently

outside a Muridke brick factory to a BLLF leader I'll call Tariq. The fifty-odd

kiln workers leaving the factory at the end of the workday scattered in all

directions when they noticed Tariq lingering outside the factory gate,

pamphlets in hand. One soot-covered girl of eight, left behind in the

confusion, burst into tears when Tariq asked if she needed help. Between sobs

the girl pleaded, "Please, sir, I have nothing to tell you. Please let me

go."<p>



Tariq did, albeit reluctantly. He has witnessed scenes like this countless

times; they happen more and more often. If they discourage him (how could they

not?), he takes care not to let anyone know. He describes his work as "an

outgrowth of my patriotism." "What we do is meant not to shame Pakistan before

the world but to create a Pakistan that respects the rights of all its peoples

and encourages human potential." Tariq is a tall, pensive thirty-nine-year-old, an artist by training and by temperament. He traces his interest in child labor

to an afternoon five years ago when an anti-slavery activist entered his

graphic-design studio in need of a brochure for his struggling organization.

"Ehsan Ulla Khan had little money to spare, and he intimated that he'd rather

not pay at all for the design work,"Tariq told me. "I was just starting out in

business and had no interest in politics or human rights. But I was moved by

his photos of the children and agreed to do the work." Within six months Tariq

was preparing all of the BLLF's documents; within a year he was overseeing its

operations. Today he is its factotum: equal parts tactician, recruiter,

instructor, fundraiser, morale-booster.<p>



Some days he is also part spy. In addition to their assigned duties, the

BLLF's 600 staff members are encouraged to spend their free time scrounging for

leads on factory owners who are especially abusive to children. All rumors are

passed on to the BLLF's Lahore headquarters. Tariq does what he can to

substantiate the worst of them, usually by touring the factories. It's a duty

he dislikes. For one thing, it's exhausting: there are too many leads, too many

rumors to verify. For another, it's dangerous: he's had numerous clashes with

publicity-shy employers and their thugs. He prefers to travel alone, reasoning

that one man is less conspicuous and less of a threat than is a group. And

despite his reservations he is adept at subterfuge, at gaining entry to

factories by masquerading as a laborer, a wholesaler, an exporter. "I do not

misrepresent myself," he says. "But if a foreman mistakes me for a businessman

or a wholesaler, I don't correct him."<p>



His first stop one day last summer was a carpet workshop in a village

twenty-four miles from Lahore. The village amounted to thirty brick huts, and

the workshop was small in proportion--about the size of a subway car, and about

as appealing. The long, narrow room contained a dozen upright looms. On each

rough-hewn workbench between the looms squatted a carpet weaver. The room was

dark and airless. Such light as there was came from a single ceiling fixture,

two of its four bulbs burned out. A thermometer read 105 degrees, and the mud walls

were hot to the touch. A window promised some relief, but it was closed against

fabric-eating insects.<p>



Tariq entered quietly, in slacks, shirt, and patent-leather loafers. This

outfit is uncommon in the provinces; he hoped it marked him as a person with

Western tastes, and his vehicle, a Toyota Land Cruiser (donated to the BLLF by

UNICEF), which he had parked conspicuously close to the entrance, marked him as

a man of means--a buyer, a broker, an exporter. The weavers smiled at him, and

a few bowed, but no one dared speak to him. Tariq took advantage of their

reverence--and the master's absence--by circling the room, noting its

conditions. After two circuits he began guessing the ages of the young weavers:

"Are you twelve?" The boy nodded. Tariq pointed to the next. "Fourteen?"

Another nod and a smile. "Ten?" This time the nod was shy, and someone

mentioned that the day before had been the boy's birthday. Tariq wished him

health and happiness.<p>



Of the twelve weavers, five were eleven to fourteen, and four were under

ten. The two youngest were brothers named Akbar and Ashraf, aged eight and

nine. They had been bonded to the carpet master at age five, and now worked six

days a week at the shop. Their workday started at 6:00 A.M. and ended at 8:00

P.M., except, they said, when the master was behind on his quotas and forced

them to work around the clock. They were small, thin, malnourished, their

spines curved from lack of exercise and from squatting before the loom. Their

hands were covered with calluses and scars, their fingers gnarled from

repetitive work. Their breathing was labored, suggestive of tuberculosis.

Collectively these ailments, which pathologists call captive-child syndrome,

kill half of Pakistan's working children by age twelve.<p>



Tariq and I watched Akbar in silence for some time. A hand-knotted carpet is

made by tying short lengths of fine colored thread to a lattice of heavier

white threads. The process is labor-intensive and tedious: a single

four-by-six-foot carpet contains well over a million knots and takes an

experienced weaver four to six months to complete. The finest, most intricate

carpets have the highest density of knots. The smaller the knot, the more knots

the weaver can cram into his lattice and the more valuable the finished carpet.

Small knots are, of course, made most easily by small hands. Each carpet Akbar

completed would retail in the United States for about $2,000--more than the boy

would earn in ten years.<p>



Observing a child carpet weaver at work generates in an American alternating

currents of admiration and anger. At one moment the boy seems a prodigy, his

carpet a lesson in geometry and colors. His patience is remarkable; his

artistry seems effortless and of the highest order--comparable to, say, that of

a great medieval tapestry master. The next moment he fumbles with his scissors,

and one notices a welt on his forearm. Suddenly the monotony of tying thousands

of threads each hour seems like torture of the worst sort--like a death

sentence, which in a way it is.<p>



After ten minutes Tariq knelt by Akbar's side and said softly, "You're very

good at this. The master must be quite pleased with you." The boy shook his

head and grimaced. "The master says I am slow and clumsy."<p>



Tariq placed a sympathetic hand on the boy's shoulder. "Have you been punished

for poor work?"he asked. The boy shrugged and tied a red knot. Tariq repeated

the question. This time the boy tied a dozen knots before answering him, in a

conspiratorial whisper. "The master screams at us all the time, and sometimes

he beats us," he said. "He is less severe with the younger boys. We're slapped

often. Once or twice he lashed us with a cane. I was beaten ten days ago, after

I made many errors of color in a carpet. He struck me with his fist quite hard

on the face." By way of corroborating this, Akbar lifted a forelock, revealing

a multicolored bruise on his right temple. Evidently the master did not

consider the blow sufficient punishment: "I was fined one thousand rupees and

made to correct the errors by working two days straight." The fine was added to

Akbar's debt, and would extend his "apprenticeship" by several months.<p>



"Do you like working here?"<p>



"Oh, no, sir, staying here longer fills me with dread. I know I must learn a

trade. But my parents are so far away, and all my friends are in school. My

brother and I would like to be with our family. We'd like to play with our

friends. This is not the way children should live."<p>



Tariq listened to this outpouring without emotion. He has cultivated what he

calls a surgeon's insensitivity to ravaged flesh, "because otherwise my heart

would break ten times a day." Neither Akbar nor the others knew that child

labor was illegal, that they were free to leave the workshop whenever they

wished. <p>



Tariq left the factory and, on a whim, headed for the district police

headquarters. As a rule BLLF members are closely observant of legal procedure,

lest they be accused of subversive activity. The organization's legal advisers

typically spend weeks drafting a formal complaint against a factory, based on

members' espionage, before they register it with a high-court magistrate. Right

now, however, Tariq was as interested in testing the responsiveness of the

police as in penalizing the factory owner.<p>



The nearest police station is a colonial relic on the Lahore road in Muridke.

Tariq was caught up in the usual bureaucratic chaos on entering. The foyer was

packed with police officers, soldiers, crime victims, and criminals, half of

them shouting, the other half covering their ears against the noise. Every now

and then the soldiers tried to impose order on the crowd, but with tattered

uniforms and clipless rifles their authority went only so far. Familiar with

such outposts, Tariq took his place in a line and forty minutes later was

face-to-face with the district sergeant. It was ten in the morning. The

sergeant had been at his post for two hours, but it could have been 200 for the

way he looked. Tariq told him about the conditions in the workshop, about the

children. The sergeant was perplexed. "Is this a crime?" he asked. "No one has

ever complained before. What do you want us to do about it?" Tariq suggested

sending officers to investigate, along with a medical-services crew for the

children.<p>



The sergeant left to consult his superior. Two minutes later he returned with

the superintendent, a gracious, mustachioed man of fifty. "We are not

unsympathetic to your complaint," the superintendent informed Tariq. "But the

place you describe is registered as a home enterprise. It is run by a small

landowner, and the workers are his immediate family. Family businesses are

exempt from the labor laws. This enterprise is not illegal." The superintendent

opened a binder and showed Tariq the workshop's registration certificate. Tariq

attempted to correct him, but the superintendent said, "What you say may or may

not be true. Unfortunately, our jurisdiction does not include child labor. I

have no authority to investigate a private workplace. I have no evidence that

the children are working there against their will or that their lives are in

jeopardy. The mechanism for doing what you ask simply does not exist here." <p>



Tariq was not disappointed, nor was he surprised. He expected no better, and

was even pleased that he had rated an audience with the superintendent.

Corruption is pervasive in the justice system: for a small consideration the

police will look the other way when employers misuse their workers. In several

districts the police are notorious for colluding with employers--supplying

factories with children who have been abducted from itinerant poor families,

orphanages, schools. Not long ago a boy of nine escaped from an abusive

landowner and sought help from a police sergeant at this very station. The boy

claimed that he had been held captive and tortured; he begged the police to

return him to his parents. Instead the sergeant ordered the "fugitive" returned

in shackles to the landowner. The sergeant later made the landowner a gift of

the shackles, suggesting that they be used on other disruptive children.

<h3>

<a name="RTFToC8">The Death of Iqbal Masih

</a></h3>

<font size=5>I</font>N 1992 Pakistani carpet exports fell for the first time in two decades. The

fall was slight in absolute terms--no more than three or four percentage

points--but it indicated that Western consumers were shying away from luxury

goods made by Third World children. Carpet makers' fears were confirmed when in

1993 and 1994 sales fell sharply in several of the largest markets for

Pakistani exports. Since carpets were an important source of foreign currency,

the decline sent shock waves throughout the Pakistani economy. At a 1993

conference, officials of the Pakistan Carpet Manufacturers and Exporters

Association blamed the decline on "subversive domestic organizations which are

conducting misleading and false international media campaigns abroad about the

use of child labor in our manufacturing processes." The conference concluded on

an optimistic note: "The memory of Western consumers is brief and our enemies'

meager resources cannot sustain their destructive campaign for much 

longer."<p>



Whatever hopes the carpet makers had for a reversal of their misfortunes were

dashed in 1994, when human-rights organizations around the world acclaimed a

twelve-year-old former slave named Iqbal Masih for his crusade against child

labor. A small, sickly boy, Iqbal had been bonded at age four to a village

carpet maker. He spent much of the next six years chained to a loom, which he

worked fourteen hours a day, six days a week. He was fed just enough to keep

him functioning, and was beaten more often than the other children at the

workshop, because, unlike them, he defied the master time and again, refusing

to work and on occasion attempting to escape. At ten he slipped his chains and

sought the help of the BLLF, which secured him his freedom and a place in a

primary school.<p>



Frail as he was, Iqbal was a child of rare gifts, possessed of an intellectual

maturity beyond his years and a precocious sense of justice. He applied these

gifts to the anti-slavery movement, and achieved results that would be

impressive for a Nobel laureate, let alone a schoolboy. By his twelfth birthday

he had helped to liberate 3,000 children from bondage at textile and brick

factories, tanneries, steelworks--industries at the heart of the Pakistani

economy. He was subsequently honored by the International Labor Organization,

in Sweden; by Reebok, which presented him with its prestigious Human Rights

Youth in Action Award (for "his courage and ingenuity in righting a

centuries-old wrong") in Boston in December of 1994; and by ABC News, which

featured him as its Person of the Week. He used his unlikely celebrity status

to remind consumers that "the world's two hundred million enslaved children are

your responsibility." Subsequent to his travels millions of people in the

United States and Europe searched their souls and decided that they could do

without products of doubtful origin from Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh.<p>



Iqbal attained a corresponding notoriety in Pakistan, particularly among the

politicians and industrialists whose feudal practices he opposed. They

responded with smear campaigns and the occasional threat of violence. Iqbal

dismissed these threats, telling his friends that they encouraged him to work

harder. He reasoned that grown men would harm a child only as a last resort,

when their own position proved vulnerable.<p>



On the evening of April 16, 1995, Easter Sunday, Iqbal Masih was shot dead

while visiting relatives in a rural village. Immediately afterward Ehsan Ulla

Khan declared that the slain youth was the victim of "a mafia conspiracy." In

the days that followed, Khan embellished his conspiracy theory for anyone

willing to listen. "I emphatically say that the carpet mafia is responsible for

this brutal killing . . . Iqbal has become a symbol of our struggle against

slavery and was not afraid to expose the inhuman practices prevailing in the

carpet industry. I have no doubt that the police are also a part of the

conspiracy." However, Khan did not support his fulminations with evidence. "I

do not rely on evidence," he told his critics. "I have my instinct. How else do

you explain how, in a village where no murder has occurred for a decade, the

one child who poses a threat to the carpet owners is gunned down? Coincidence

is never so cruel." To the claim of the local police that Iqbal's murder was an

isolated incident Khan retorts, "The evidence can be found if the police could

be bothered to look." The killing remains unsolved.<p>



Eight hundred mourners crowded into the Muridke cemetery for Iqbal's funeral. A

week later 3,000 protesters, half of them under twelve, marched through the

streets of Lahore demanding an end to child labor. A few days after the funeral

Khan left Pakistan to consult with children's-rights activists in Europe. There

he repeated his accusations to great effect at conferences, on television,

before lawmakers. Iqbal was proclaimed a "martyr for the cause of bonded

labor"; his murder became a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre among the

intelligentsia. Khan called upon the Human Rights Commission of the United

Nations to ban the import and sale of all products made by children, especially

carpets. "I appeal to importers and consumers: say no and only no to child-made

carpets," he said. "This is the last message of Iqbal. It would be an insult to

his blood and memory if people continue to buy child-made products in any part

of the world."<p>



Western consumers have responded to Khan's plea. Sales of imported carpets have

fallen precipitously in recent months. Bowing to public pressure, importers in

the United States, Sweden, Italy, Britain, France, and Germany by last June had

canceled carpet orders collectively valued at $10 million. At the same time,

human-rights groups and individual sympathizers have donated large sums to

support and expand BLLF operations. Ironically, Iqbal's death opened doors and

purses that were previously closed to Khan.<p>



Westerners, who have seen economic weapons used to achieve social reforms,

might expect canceled orders to result in negotiation and, with luck,

accommodation between industrialists and activists. Pakistan's industrialists,

however, have chosen the questionable tactic of denying the existence of bonded

labor in their factories. Shahid Rashid Butt, the president of the Islamabad

Carpet Exporters Association, told his colleagues, "Our industry is the victim

of enemy agents who spread lies and fictions around the world that bonded labor

and child labor are utilized in the production of hand-knotted carpets. They

are not and have never been." He condemned the BLLF and its allies as Jewish

and Indian enemies who had launched a systematic campaign to damage the

reputation of Pakistan's carpet industry for their own profit. His remarks were

enthusiastically endorsed by the Pakistan Carpet Manufacturers and Exporters

Association and echoed in the National Assembly.<p>



"These charges flew in the face not just of reason but also of an extraordinary

amount of evidence," says I. A. Rehman, the director of the Human Rights

Commission of Pakistan. "Anywhere else they would have been laughed at and

dismissed. Here they were accepted as fact and acted on." At the urging of

politicians and industrialists, Javed Mahmood, the assistant director of

Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), last May launched an inquiry

into the BLLF on the strength of information he had received from highly placed

sources suggesting that the organization was supported by "Pakistan's

enemies."He later said, "I consider the information credible and will do all I

can to protect our country's commercial interests from unscrupulous enemies."

At the same time, Pakistan's leading newspapers began running "expos&eacute;s"

of abolitionist leaders, the nicest of which characterized Ehsan Ulla Khan as a

philandering bigamist with "indisputable ties to Jewish and Indian agencies

hostile to Pakistan." The publishers of these newspapers are suspected of

having large financial interests in industries employing child labor.<p>



The FIA is a secret police force, and one of its best-kept secrets is whom it

works for. Nominally an organ of the state, it is not above accepting freelance

assignments from prominent individuals and commercial groups. The extent of its

extralegal activities is anyone's guess, but a highly respected human-rights

investigator believes that "there is close cooperation between carpet

interests, feudal lords, segments of the police force, and the

administration--district commissioners, the courts, and government officials.

Financially resourceful drug barons are also a part of the scene." Whoever the

client, the FIA provides an assortment of services straight out of the KGB

handbook: wiretaps, tails, searches, arrests, harassment, and varying degrees

of corporal punishment.<p>



These services were very much in evidence on a Thursday afternoon in late June,

when the FIA raided the BLLF's Lahore headquarters. The detail consisted of ten

men, all in plain clothes, who scrambled up four flights of stairs to the tiny

office in no time flat. These were not ordinary policemen; this was not the

usual surprise "inspection" (read "intimidation") to which all nongovernment

organizations are periodically subjected. These were professional agents, lithe

and expert, commanded by a severe officer in a freshly pressed safari suit.

After lining the BLLF workers up against a wall, he ordered his troops to

"confiscate anything that may incriminate them." The agents took a liberal view

of "incriminate," and packed up computers, filing cabinets, fax machines,

photocopiers, telephones, stationery, posters, bicycles--and the cashbox

containing the monthly payroll. Their depredations were supervised by a small

man who was distinctly not a policeman. He represented, it turned out, the

Pakistan Carpet Manufacturers and Exporters Association. His purpose, he said,

was "to protect the interests of legitimate businessmen." Every so often he

consulted with the commander.<p>



When one BLLF worker tried to protest, an agent threw her against a wall and

held a rifle butt inches from her face. When another worker demanded to see a

search warrant, the commander informed her that none was necessary, because "we

are acting to prevent terrorism." The association representative nodded in

agreement.<p>



Fifteen minutes later the detail was gone, along with the office equipment and

furnishings. All that remained was a heap of broken furniture, a

workers'-rights poster, and a BLLF flag dangling out an open window. Several

staff workers had been taken away as well, to an FIA holding center, where they

were interrogated for three days.<p>



Two days later another FIA detail raided the BLLF's "Freedom Campus" training

facility in Lahore, along with several of its primary schools around the

country. Once again the agents were undiscriminating. They seized everything

movable ("items used to obstruct valid commercial interests") and mistreated

the staff without respect for position or age. Teachers, drivers, secretaries,

and peasant families seeking refuge from violent employers were interrogated

along with administrators, advocates, attorneys, and fundraisers. <p>



After an earlier raid on BLLF headquarters Fatima Ghulam, the director of the

BLLF's women's-education program, was held for two days. "An officer promised

to release me immediately if I agreed to inform against Ehsan Ulla Khan and

some of the others," Ghulam says. "He wanted me to testify that Khan is a

subversive, an enemy agent, and that the BLLF receives money from foreign

governments. He said he had tapped my telephone conversations and had

recordings of me discussing treasonable acts. If I wanted to avoid prosecution,

I would have to cooperate with the FIA. I refused, and he kept me without food

or water. When I wouldn't speak to him the next day, he slapped me and dragged

me around the room."<p>



Not to be outdone, the Pakistani press stepped up its campaign against the

BLLF. Last summer a number of newspapers whose editorial pages conceded that

they were "troubled by the carpet export crisis" reported the following

"facts": Khan himself had murdered Iqbal Masih to win sympathy for the BLLF;

Khan had misappropriated BLLF funds to support his own decadent lifestyle; Khan

routinely used BLLF schoolchildren as sex partners and house slaves; Iqbal

Masih was a twenty-one-year-old midget whom Khan paid to masquerade as a carpet

child; the BLLF was an outpost of India's intelligence agency; Khan was an

Indian agent working to disgrace the Pakistani carpet trade. These same papers

also "revealed" that carpet workers enjoy a higher standard of living than the

average citizen, along with better working conditions. "The few children

working on carpets," one editorial assured its readers, "do so after school, in

their own homes, under the supervision of loving parents."<p>



In the wake of these attacks BLLF operations--child-welfare programs, schools,

training and education programs--nearly shut down for lack of funds and staff.

Membership has suffered, and many of the legal advisers and support staff,

fearing reprisals, have fallen away. Those who remain are subject to almost

constant harassment: the fortunate ones have their telephones tapped; the less

fortunate are shadowed around the clock. At the same time, the courts have

ignored their complaints about child labor and abusive treatment by

employers.<p>



Just in case the intention of the Federal Investigation Agency was unclear,

Assistant Director Mahmood in early June charged Ehsan Ulla Khan, who was still

abroad, and a BLLF strategist named Zafaryab Ahmad with sedition and economic

treason, capital offenses punishable by death. According to Mahmood, "The

accused men conspired with the Indian espionage agency to exploit the murder of

Iqbal Masih . . . causing a recurring huge financial loss to Pakistan's

business interests abroad and paving the way for India to wage economic warfare

against Pakistan." Ahmad was arrested and taken to a Lahore jail, where, after

repudiating the charges (he called them "foolish and absurd"), he was denied

bail. The FIA has since refused to provide BLLF attorneys with evidence

supporting the charges, although Mahmood assures them that it consists of

"videotapes and recordings of telephone conversations that amount to firm

proof." Mahmood has vowed to arrest Khan "the very moment he returns to

Pakistan, the moment his aircraft touches down."<p>



Ehsan Ulla Khan remains in Europe, an unhappy exile. "They will jail me if I

return to Pakistan," he told me shortly after he left his country. "Our

attorneys tell me I am of greater use to the BLLF here, speaking out against

the authorities, than I would be inside a Lahore cell. I fear for my people.

The police have harassed many of them, and so many more have left us out of

fear. We are demoralized. We cannot pay our bills and our staff. Our schools

may close and our thousands of students may end up in the very factories we

saved them from. Our offices and homes are under surveillance. Our telephones

are tapped. We are fighting for our survival. If the attacks do not stop soon,

it is possible that the BLLF will perish. That would be tragic. What will

become of the children of Pakistan?" <p>

	<font size=5>I</font>rvin Matus has performed a useful service by disposing of some of the weaker

anti-Stratfordian arguments. I agree that the Stratford man was at no time

"packed off" to his home town, that Lord Hunsdon was the patron of the

Chamberlain's Men, and that Elizabethans did not think holograph manuscripts

worth keeping. Philip Henslowe's failure to mention Shakespeare doesn't concern

me. I am pleased to hear that plays were classified as "riffraffs" by literary

folk: this would help to explain the use of a pseudonym by a play-writing

nobleman.<p>



<p>



I agree that Shakespeare's reputation was not by any means the equal of Ben

Jonson's in the seventeenth century. All the easier to believe that his

identity could remain obscured, and all the more surprising that plays he did

not write, such as A Yorkshire Tragedy, should be attributed during his

lifetime to his pen. This never happened with Jonson, Beaumont, or Fletcher.

(Beaumont died a month before Shakspere and--in contrast to the neglected

Stratford man--was buried in Westminster Abbey.) As for Ben Jonson's

"rudimentary schooling," David Riggs writes in his 1989 biography, "By the time

he left Westminster, he had committed substantial portions of Cato, Terence,

Ovid, Virgil, Cicero, and Horace to memory."<p>



<p>



In insisting that the Stratford man was "a man of the theater," Matus is simply

trying to smuggle in the playwright with the actor. What is the warrant for

claiming that there is "an ample supply of references to Shakespeare as a

player and PLAYWRIGHT..."? Except for Greenes Groats-worth of Wit (1592), which

I will discuss in a moment, there are no personal references to the Stratford

man as a playwright that antedate his death. "Shakespeare" appears on quartos

after 1598, but whether the Stratford man wrote them is precisely the point at

issue.<p>



<p>



The dichotomy that Matus is so eager to establish between the stage-writer and

the belletrist depends for its point on the bold claim (inserted

parenthetically) that Oxford was not a man of the theater. Any evidence here?

Oxford's comedies were praised by Meres, and he was the patron of two acting

companies. The praise that Matus heaps on Shakespeare the stage-writer could

apply equally to Oxford.<p>



<p>



Stratfordian dogma has it that once plays were sold, the playwright surrendered

all rights to them. But this claim should be treated with skepticism. By the

time Shakspere joined the company, in 1594, Titus Andronicus was a hit and the

two long poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, were selling well.

Are we really to believe that, having written Othello, Macbeth, and Antony and

Cleopatra, the Stratford man remained in such a weak bargaining position with

his fellow actors that he was reduced in later life to seeking remuneration in

the small-claims courts rather than from publishers? Are we also to believe (as

his will implies) that he remained indifferent to the fate of these

masterpieces, then still unpublished? I don't believe it.<p>



<p>



Curiously, Matus fails to mention the main evidence for Shakspere's claim to

authorship, found in the introductory material to the First Folio. Poems by Ben

Jonson, Leonard Digges, and two others contrive to praise the poet while

failing to provide information about his life. As the Oxfordian scholar Peter

Moore points out, the Folio even omits Shakspere's proudest claim: his hard-won

title of gentleman, his coat of arms and motto. In a society as conscious of

rank as England then was, this was tantamount to failing to give his full

name.<p>



<p>



Jonson does refer to the poet as "Sweet Swan of Avon," however, and Digges

alludes to "thy Stratford Moniment." Those phrases, written after Shakspere's

death, are the strongest links between the playwright and the Stratford man

that we have. Jonson and Digges convey no other biographical information,

however. We don't even know if the frontispiece engraving, by Droeshout,

resembles the Stratford man.<p>



<p>



Certain aspects of the First Folio are more than a little suspect. It opens

with a dedication, supposedly written by Shakspere's fellow actors John Heminge

and Henry Condell, "to the most Noble and Incomparable Paire of Brethren,"

William and Philip Herbert, the Earls of Pembroke and Montgomery. A preface

addressed to "the great Variety of Readers" is also imputed to these players.

In the eighteenth century the Shakespeare scholar Edmond Malone argued that in

all probability Ben Jonson wrote this preface. In parallel columns over several

pages he juxtaposed extracts attributed to Heminge and Condell in the Folio

with corresponding passages in Jonson's works. (In the Folio: "How odde soever

your braines be or your wisdomes...." In Jonson's Discoveries: "How odde soever

mens braines or wisdomes be.") It is likely that Jonson in fact wrote both the

preface and the dedication.<p>



<p>



Some claims attributed to Heminge and Condell are also suspect. In earlier

(quarto) printings the plays had been "maimed and deformed by the frauds and

stealthes of injurious impostors," the Folio notes, but now at last they were

made available "cur'd and perfect of their limbes." In this respect, it was

implied, the author's clean copy had been a help, for "we have scarse received

from him a blot in his papers." Textual scholarship has demonstrated, however,

that for many of the previously published plays the Folio editors used not

manuscripts but the same "maimed and deformed" quartos already cited.<p>



<p>



Thus the testimony of the Folio, at least in part, is suspect. It cannot be

taken at face value. Ogburn quotes James Boswell the younger (1778-1822) as

saying that there is "something fishy" about the whole thing. Some commentators

have noted the sharp contrast between Ben Jonson's earlier lukewarm or

disparaging comments about Shakespeare and his effusive praise in the Folio.

Was this a command performance? The Earl of Pembroke was Jonson's patron, not

to mention the Lord Chamberlain. As Lord Chamberlain he controlled the Revels

Office and the licensing of plays for performance and publication. In the Folio

the Earls of Pembroke and Montgomery are praised for having treated both the

plays "and their Authour living" with "so much favour."<p>



<p>



Who were these literary noblemen? In 1604 the Earl of Montgomery married Susan

Vere, Oxford's youngest daughter. Marriage between Pembroke and Oxford's second

daughter, Bridget, was proposed in 1597, but it fell through. The Folio, then,

was dedicated to Oxford's son-in-law and the son-in-law's brother. The role

they may have played in the publication of the Folio is a matter for

speculation, but the circumstances are suggestive. In the strange 1609 preface

to Troilus and Cressida, incidentally, the author of that play is coyly not

named, and other works by him are referred to as being retained by certain

unnamed "grand possessors."<p>



<p>



Let us turn to Greenes Groats-worth of Wit, a pamphlet originally attributed to

Robert Greene but now thought to have been written by Henry Chettle, and one of

the stronger weapons in the Stratfordian arsenal. The pamphlet alerts

playwrights to an "upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his

Tygers hart wrapt in a Players hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out

a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute Johannes fac totum, is

in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country." Since "Tygers hart wrapt

in a Players hide" is adapted from Henry VI, Part III, and since there is a pun

on Shakespeare's name, the Stratfordians contend that the passage establishes

the Stratford man as a playwright. But does it?<p>



<p>



The reference does seem to be to Shakspere--albeit a Shakspere who is

apparently passing himself off in the "feathers" of a playwright. If the man

really WAS a playwright, of course, this would have made little sense as an

expose.<p>



<p>



Now notice what happened next. Chettle swiftly backtracked. The pamphlet,

written to "divers playmakers," had been "offensively...taken." Two people took

offense, apparently. Chettle was acquainted with neither of them, "and with one

of them I care not if I never be." (Shakspere, I surmise.) Chettle apologized

to the other. "Divers of worship have reported his uprightness of dealing,

which argues his honesty, and his facetious [polished] grace in writing...."

Possibly, then, Chettle found out that the upstart Shakspere, relatively new in

town, was putting on airs as a "playmaker" (that is, fronting for Oxford). Not

realizing that a nobleman had arranged it, Chettle imprudently blew the

whistle. He soon found out that divers of worship could do without

investigative journalism Elizabethan style, and he duly groveled.<p>



<p>



Stratfordians sometimes resemble fundamentalist theologians, who cling

tenaciously to the idea that a sacred text is literally true and must then

ingeniously explain away a mass of subversive evidence that contradicts it.

That evidence is not going away, and it cannot be dismissed with the ad hominen

argument (now frequently heard) that it is propounded by snobs who can't bear

the idea of Shakespeare's being a common man. (Was Looney a snob?) It is the

evidence itself that must be addressed. The many connections between Edward de

Vere and the works of William Shakespeare can no more be explained away by

attacking Oxfordians for their alleged snobbery than the apparent inadequacy of

Shakspere of Stratford can be explained away on grounds of the "essential

incomprehensibility of genius," to use Schoenbaum's phrase.<p>



<p>



There may well be more material yet to be discovered. If the Oxford theory of

authorship is correct, a great deal of the Shakespeare research in the past 200

years has been done in the wrong place. The academy's almost total lack of

interest in the subject over the past seventy years has ensured that only a

relative handful of people have done any Oxford-related research since Looney

wrote his book. Steven May, of Georgetown College, speaks eloquently about the

still unresearched Elizabethan archives in English country houses and record

offices. He mentions in particular Longleat and the National Library of Wales.

"The manuscript materials have not been searched as carefully as everyone

thinks," he says. He is confident that more material on De Vere is out there.<p>



<p>



Oxford's oldest daughter, Elizabeth, married William Stanley, the sixth Earl of

Derby, and their granddaughter married into the Wentworth family in Yorkshire.

Two years ago an unemployed Englishman (on welfare!) researched Wentworth

Woodhouse, one of the largest houses in England. The most valuable portion of

its library had been sold to Sotheby's in 1948. Among the books sold were

Holinshed's Chronicles (1587 edition), The Noble Arte of Venerie or Hunting

(l575), Castiglione's Il Cortegiano (1562), Hakluyt's Voyages, and the Amyot

translation of Plutarch's Lives--signed by Shakespeare's friend, the third Earl

of Southampton. (Sotheby's kept the names of the buyers.)<p>



<p>



Probably nothing to it, Steven May said when I told him about this. And

probably he's right. It's interesting, though. They never did find one book

owned by the Stratford man. Possibly, just possibly, the big Shakespeare find

that so many scholars have looked for in vain for so many years is still out

there in the library or attic of one of those country houses.

    <h4>Government</h4>

	Tax Freedom Day--the day by which the average American would have paid his tax
bill for the year if all income initially went toward taxes--will almost
certainly fall in May, as it has for the past 10 years. The precise date is not
available as of this writing; however, according to the Tax Foundation, the
research organization that calculates the date each year, this could be the
latest Tax Freedom Day yet, because of the country's economic growth: higher
incomes mean higher tax brackets. Tax Freedom Day has gradually slipped from
January 31 (1902) to May 6 (1994 and 1995). Americans seeking consolation might
consider that Canada, Germany, and France usually reach Tax Freedom Day in late
June.

	Deer ticks become active this month; as a result, the risk of contracting
tick-borne diseases rises. The most notorious of these is 
<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/other/case_def/lyme.html">Lyme disease,</A> which
typically manifests itself as a rash and fever and may go on to cause chronic
joint and muscle pain and neurological damage. However, doctors have identified
two other tick-borne diseases, which produce symptoms similar to, but usually
more severe than, those of Lyme disease. There have been some 100 cases of
human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) and more than 400 of human monocytic
ehrlichiosis (HME), with more than 10 fatalities, since the diseases were
recognized, in 1993 and 1985. The overlap in symptoms among the three diseases
can create treatment problems, because they do not all respond to the same
antibiotics.
	
	<br clear=all>
	
	<h4>Environment</h4>
		<img src="./Pineco.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>	
	
	Fires will be burning this month in at least two of the nation's nature
preserves: the Indian Boundary Prairies, in Illinois, and the Albany Pine Bush
Preserve, in New York. <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org/">The Nature Conservancy,</A> a nonprofit organization that
manages the tracts, will be setting the blazes in an effort to limit the risk
of wildfires and to maintain healthy and diverse plant life. Prescribed
burning--the setting of controlled fires--is not a new practice; however, it
may be on the rise. Prompted in large part by the unusually severe wildfire
season of 1994, the <A HREF="http://www.npsc.nbs.gov/resource/tools/burning/burning.htm">U.S. Forest Service</A> is aiming to increase the area it
burns--now some 350,000 acres annually--by 30 percent a year for the next three
years. If it does (weather, among other things, could change its plans), it may
run afoul of the Environmental Protection Agency, which is concerned that the
resulting soot and smoke could violate the 1990 Clean Air Act.

	<h4>Arts &amp; Letters</h4>

	May <b>1</b>, The book publisher Scribner begins reaping the benefits of a
60-year-old option clause today, as <i>Lost Laysen</i>, the only other known
work of fiction by Margaret Mitchell--who wrote <i>Gone With the
Wind</i>--appears in bookstores across the country. <i>Lost Laysen</i>, a love
story set in the South Pacific, was written in 1916, when Mitchell was 16 years
old. It surfaced last year among the papers of one of her friends. The Mitchell
estate had planned to auction the work, but Scribner found that Mitchell's
contract with Macmillan, Scribner's predecessor, gave the company an option on
future books. Although Scribner has released only a few pages from the novel's
preface in advance of publication, certain similarities to <i>Gone With the
Wind</i> are apparent: the protagonists of <i>Lost Laysen</i>, a missionary
woman and a ship's first mate, are "a strong-willed woman who places her honor
above her life" and "a man who desires this woman with all his heart but who
can never obtain her."

	<h4>The Skies</h4>
	<img src="./Moon.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>	
	
	May <b>3</b>, Full Moon, also known this month as the Planting or Milk Moon.
<b>5</b>, Venus reaches its greatest brilliance for the year and its highest
elevation in the sky for the rest of the century. Alert observers may spot it
during daylight hours as well as during the early evening; late in the month it
may even be possible to discern that it is crescent-shaped. <b>13</b>, the
waning Moon lies close to Saturn in the predawn sky.
	
	<br clear=all>
	
	<h4>Food</h4>
	<img src="./Shrimp.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>	
	
	May <b>1</b>, as of today no shrimp may be imported from nations that fail to
use "turtle-safe" shrimping nets--those from which sea turtles can escape. The
ban is the result of a ruling last December by a federal judge who found that
the U.S. Commerce Department, among others, had not fully implemented a 1989
law that required countries that export shrimp to the United States to reduce
accidental sea-turtle deaths. For the past six years the United States has
applied the law only to those countries that fish in the Caribbean and the
western Atlantic. The comprehensive ban will affect 44 additional countries and
imports of shrimp worth more than a billion dollars. Also this month the season
for fiddleheads--the edible shoots of ostrich ferns--begins. Found in the
Northeast and along the Canadian coast, fiddleheads have for centuries been
eaten safely both cooked and raw. However, some recent outbreaks of
gastrointestinal illness following the ingestion of al dente fiddleheads have
led scientists to speculate that a new strain of the ferns may be mildly toxic,
and the Centers for Disease Control now recommends that fiddleheads be boiled
thoroughly for at least 20 minutes.

	<h4>50 Years Ago</h4>
	<img src="./Billb.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>	
	
	Jacques Barzun, writing in the May, 1946, issue of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>:
"Advertisers have much to answer for. No doubt the world will soon forget,
among worse atrocities, that a wartime invention was sold as a 'Black-out
safety luminous gardenia,' but I wonder whether posterity will overlook the
debased verbal instincts that allowed us to turn two admirable
words--collaboration (which means working together) and appeasement (which
means bringing peace into the heart)--into marks of opprobrium. We can blame
the newspapers, but they act on prepared minds, and it is often a step upwards
from billboard vulgarity to journalese."

	<i></i>Historians and linguistic scholars have an assortment of opinions about

what the first decade of the present century was called: it went by <i>the

nineteen hundreds, the aughty-aughts, </i>or simply <i>the new decade </i>and

other non-names, various personages have assured me. <i>The twenty hundreds?

The aughty-aughts? </i>Those precedents don't help us now. Many new coinages

have been put forward over the past decade or so, among them <i>the zilches,

that people seem inclined to take seriously, though, are <i>the ohs, the double

Certain arms of the media have been trying to resolve the issue: <i>The New

York Times</i>, for example, has to date published two editorials in favor of

<i>the ohs</i>. But this isn't something that <i>can </i>be resolved by any

given authority. English is wonderfully democratic: words and phrases enter the

standard vocabulary because large numbers of people like them and find them

useful. In this case we may well fail to settle on one choice, and a hundred

years from now historians and linguistic scholars will have an assortment of

opinions about what we called the first decade of the new millennium. Maybe

precedent is telling us something after all.<p><p><br><p><br>

<i>My grandmother used to illustrate the difference between </i>will <i>and

</i>shall <i>with the following two sentences: "I </i>shall <i>drown; no one

</i>will <i>save me" and "I </i>will <i>drown; no one </i>shall <i>save me."

One sentence denotes intention; the other denotes desperation. But which is

which? </i><p>

													<!--BARBARA"S RESPONSE TEXT-->

	<i></i>You're not the only one who's confused by <i>shall </i>and <i>will </i>.

A few months ago, attempting to hammer out a budget bill, Senator Bob Dole and

Senator Tom Daschle were at a loss for the proper wording. "Holding a

dictionary between them and pouring [sic] through its pages," <i>The New York

Times </i>reported, "the two leaders agreed that the words were synonymous.

They agreed on <i>shall </i> ."<p>





				<img src="./wordct3.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>



I wish they'd called me. The traditional distinction made in England is that in

the first person <i>will </i>has to do with willpower--that is, it denotes

intentionality--and <i>shall </i>with simple futurity, whereas the second and

third persons reverse the pattern. Thus your two sentences mean, respectively,

"I am going to drown, and no one is going to save me" and "I mean to drown, and

no one had better save me." (In fact, the latter of your sentences is the punch

line of an antique joke about a Scotsman whom well-brought-up English folk

mistakenly allowed to drown, because--well, you get the idea.) <p>



There are, however, many traditional exceptions to the traditional rule, and

even the Fowler brothers--admirable watchdogs of traditional English

English--were forced to admit, in their <i>The King's English </i>(1906), that

the idiomatic use of the two words, "while it comes by nature to southern

Englishmen, . . . is so complicated that those who are not to the manner born

can hardly acquire it."<p>



In the United States today, most authorities agree, <i>will </i>does the better

part of the jobs that it once took the two words to do, and what <i>will 

</i>doesn't do is generally taken care of in other ways, such as by <i>is going

to </i>or the cleverly vague<i> 'll</i>. Except in set phrases like

"<i>Shall </i> we dance?" and "We <i>shall </i>overcome," <i>shall </i>now

strikes most Americans as an affectation. When you're in doubt, therefore, use

<i>will </i>. Bob Dole and Tom Daschle notwithstanding, it's the all-American

choice.<p>

<blockquote>
<font size=5>W</font>HEN the <i>Washington Post </i>media reporter Howard
Kurtz needed a title for
his recent book on daytime-television <A
HREF="http://tvnet.com/UTVL/tal_list.html">talk shows</A> (which epitomize,
in his view,
America's increasingly "run-at-the-mouth culture"), a term suggesting a
conflation of airwaves and vaporous blather was ready to hand: <A
HREF="http://www.bookscapes.com/hotair.html"><i>Hot Air </i></A>.
One rule of thumb about slang is that the more prevalent the object, activity,
or behavior being described, and the more intense its psychological salience,
the more numerous and diverse the slang terms available to describe it. The
demand for slang denoting nonsense--or, if you will, <i>applesauce, hogwash,
hokum, hooey, jive, piffle, tommyrot, </i>or <i>twaddle </i>--stems from the
fact that people talk so much of it.<p>

<img src="wordimpr.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

The first reference to <i>hot air</i>, in the sense of boasting or nonsense,
that is cited in historical dictionaries<i> </i>comes from <i>The Gilded Age </i>(1873), by <A HREF="http://web.syr.edu/~fjzwick/twainwww.html">Mark
Twain</A> and Charles Dudley Warner. The book refers to "the
hot air of the capital"--but although the association of <i>hot air </i>and
Washington seems fitting, it is not clear that Twain and Warner meant to do
anything other than refer to the temperature of the atmosphere. (The text is
ambiguous.) The first unequivocal citation comes from the humorist <A
HREF="http://www.spcc.com/ihsw/ade.htm">George Ade</A>'s
<i>Fables in Slang </i>(1900): "He talked what is technically known as Hot
Air." By century's end, then, the slang meaning was well established, as was
the derivative term <A
HREF="http://www.netspace.org/~mrl/projects/writing/slang.html#sec2"><i>ball
oon juice </i></A>(at least at Yale)--no doubt helped
along by the pneumatic ancestors <i>gas </i>and <i>wind</i>. <A
HREF="http://www.italgas.it/archivio/Librone.html"><i>Gas </i>was
coined in its literal sense</A> by the seventeenth-century Dutch chemist J.
B. van
Helmont, who derived it from the Greek word <i>khaos </i>, meaning, well,
"chaos." The slang meaning had developed in English by the late 1700s, and in
the nineteenth century <i>gas </i>was without question a popular word for
"empty talk." <i>Wind </i>led to <i>windies </i>, which in the American
Southwest referred to tall tales. <i>Windbags </i>and <i>gasbags </i>, of
course, are found all over.<p>
If one major class of nonsense-related slang derives, naturally enough, from
the gaseous language of breath and speech, another derives from the world of
organic liquids and solids of dubious value. In the early seventeenth century
<i>balderdash </i>was a mixture of liquors (or even of beer and
buttermilk)--beneath the notice of serious tipplers. Restoration writers
eventually applied the word to worthless rhetoric. <i>Baloney </i>made a
similar transition by 1922, after six decades as simply the name of an
inexpensive sausage made from some of the least choice cuts of meat. For
emphasis nowadays one may say <i>bull-oney </i>, creating a phonetic and
psychological link to the long-popular <i>bull </i>, and to a meadowful of
metaphors we may as well skip here.<p>
But not entirely. Old yearbooks show that cadets at <A
HREF="http://www.usma.edu">West Point</A> called voluble
talk <i>B.S. </i>as early as 1900--evidently a transparent abbreviation even
then. A more recent euphemism is <i>bull hockey</i>, which has nothing to do
with sports; newer still are <i>bull puckey </i>and the mysterious <i>bull
dinky</i>. The dismissive Americanism
 <A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/complife/print/9505/review/doc4.html">
<i>poppycock </i>has scatological
overtones in the original Dutch.</A> Though Americans today associate a curt
outburst of <i>"Poppycock!" </i>with English gentry, in truth the word was once
unfathomable in England; <A
HREF="http://theory.tifr.res.in/bombay/persons/rudyard-kipling.html">Rudyard
Kipling</A>, when recounting for English readers
in 1891 a conversation he had had in California, felt the need to substitute
the word <i>bosh</i>. The origins of the recent British favorite <A
HREF="http://www.dur.ac.uk/~dgl3djb/ukus.html#codswallop"><i>codswallop
</i></A>remain in dispute.<p>
Henry Ford told a reporter in 1916, "History is more or less
<i>bunk </i>"--short for <i>buncombe </i>, often applied to insincere political
speech. (This word is associated with <A
HREF="http://www.openweb.com/wmg/bunc_co/">Buncombe County</A>, in North
Carolina, and
an incident in which Felix Walker, an early-nineteenth-century politician from
that district, droned on and on in Congress despite entreaties from his
colleagues, insisting that he was speaking "for Buncombe.") Ford, with his
offhand remark, presaged the ahistoricism of much contemporary cultural
theory--which itself may contain no small degree of <i>malarkey </i>(origin
unknown).<p>

<blockquote>

<i><font size=4>The case revolves around one white man's claim that he was discriminated

against in favor of blacks, but far more is at stake in the deliberations now

getting under way before the Supreme Court of the United States.  Is America

ever really going to be the Land of Opportunity for all its citizens?</i></font><p>





<pre>



</pre>





<font size=5>T</font>HIS fall the U.S. Supreme Court hears argument in the case of The Regents

of the University of California v. Allan Bakke.  Its response may be fateful

for the future of racial fairness in this country.<p>



     The question immediately presented is whether Alan Bakke, a white man of

evident determination and ability, has been wrongfully denied admission to The

Medical School of the University of California at Davis because sixteen places

out of a hundred in each entering class have been reserved for qualified

members of racial minorities.  The Supreme Court of California has held that

this special admissions program is unconstitutional on the ground that it

violates the rights guaranteed to the majority by the equal protection clause

of the Fourteenth Amendment.<p>



     More broadly, because of the argument by which the California Supreme

Court upheld Mr. Bakke's claim, the question presented is whether any

educational institution whose admissions are selective may consider the race of

any person as an affirmative element in qualification for entry.  What is

directly threatened is the nationwide effort to open our most selective

educational institutions to more than token numbers of those who are not white.

And indirectly but forcefully, the California doctrine threatens the

constitutionality of all forms of affirmative action that are aimed explicitly

at helping racial minorities.<p>



     Right at the outset it is well to report the alarm the California decision

has produced among people who are convinced that the efforts upon which they

are engaged are not merely legitimate, but in some fundamental sense required

by our Constitution, our history, and our intent as a nation to get past our

terrible inheritance of racism.  These efforts have effected a transformation

in the quality and quantity of high-level opportunity for blacks and other

under-represented minorities.  This whole enterprise is now challenged.  No one

knows how far the California doctrine might affect private as well as public

institutions, and colleges as well as professional schools.  But the prospect

of heavy direct and indirect effect throughout the world of selective higher

education and beyond is chilling.  I weigh my words when I report that among

those affected the fate of the appeal from California is increasingly seen to

have an importance not exceeded by any single case from the past, not the Brown

case of 1954, and not the Dartmouth College case itself, in which the

independence of the chartered private college was first upheld.<p>



<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>T</font>HE struggle for racial equality is old, but the constitutional questions

presented by special admissions to colleges and graduate schools are new.

Through the 1930s and 1940s the cases that rose to the Supreme Court were

concerned with the exclusion of blacks from segregated professional schools.

In the 1950s and 1960s the Court was occupied first with its great decision in

Brown, declaring segregation in the public schools unconstitutional, and then

with a long series of cases in which it was presented with one effort after

another to evade the import of that decision.  It did not confront problems

like those of Allan Bakke because programs like the one to which he objects did

not exist.  In the early 1970s, a quite similar case, that of Marco DeFunis

against the Law School of the University of Washington, was never decided

because DeFunis was eventually admitted to the Law School and had almost

finished by the time the Supreme Court was ready.  The DeFunis case had great

consequences in arousing feelings and stirring reflection, but it did nothing

to clarify the constitutional standing of special admissions.<p>



     Large-scale attempts to increase the numbers of minorities in selective

colleges and professional schools have a short history.  In medical schools,

for example, the effort became general less than ten years ago.  These initial

actions were compelled neither by government nor by courts.  They were the

product rather of the recognition, by whites as well as blacks, that the

barriers to educational opportunity did not tumble in a day after the civil

rights victories of the 1950s and early 1960s.  Black demand, white awareness,

riots in the cities, and the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. were all a part

of what brought the change, but its deeper and more durable cause was the

growing conviction that there was a fundamental contradiction between an

asserted opposition to racism and the maintenance, by whatever process of

selection, of essentially all-white colleges and professional schools.  Law

schools, medical schools, graduate schools, and selective colleges all across

the country began to recognize a direct responsibility to find and make room

for larger numbers of qualified nonwhites.<p>



    Many legitimate purposes have animated those engaged in this effort, but

the deepest and most general objective--toward which any one school or college

can do only a little--has been to ensure full and fair access to all parts of

our social, economic, and professional life for nonwhite Americans.  Of course

all kinds of Americans deserve such access, and it is right to remember from

the outset that no past injustice permits us to set any one group above any

other.  But there can be no blinking the enormous and unique set of handicaps

which our whole history, right up to the present, has imposed on those who are

not white.  It is not the fault of today's laws or of the present Supreme Court

that racism should be our most destructive inheritance.  But that reality makes

the effort to overcome it a matter of the most compelling interest.<p>





     The essence of this new enterprise, whether at the college or the graduate

level, has been the making of special attempts to find, attract, enroll, and

support students who are members of disadvantaged racial minorities.  So far

this has meant mainly blacks, and in this discussion I shall often refer to

them alone, simply to shorten matters.  But the programs are directed also at

Hispanic students and native Americans, and often at Americans of Asian origin.

They include one or all of the following elements:  active recruitment, targets

or goals or even quotas for numbers enrolled, high levels of financial aid, and

special courses or other academic arrangements when they are needed to help the

student succeed.  In all these programs attention to race, indeed special

attention because of race, has been essential. <p>



     These new programs, in medical schools and elsewhere, have not yet been

comprehensively and comparatively studied, and even if we knew more about them

than we do, we could not know enough for confident judgment of their effects.

The first medical students to enter by special admissions have not yet had time

to prove themselves as practicing physicians, and in any case the programs of

the medical schools have changed in shape while the number of minority students

admitted has been growing, from less than 300 in 1968 to 1400 in 1976.  Such

evidence as we have--much of it oral and informal--suggests that most medical

schools have had a great deal to learn in this short time about judging

minority candidates, about helping them to come to terms with their own

environment, and about treading the narrow and necessary path between

sympathetic recognition of difficulties and cynical or condescending acceptance

of unsatisfactory performance.  Many minority students have had much to learn

about these same matters.<p>



     These conclusions seem to fit not only medical schools but law schools and

selective colleges, public and private.  In law schools, the number of

minorities has more than trebled in less than ten years.  In selective

colleges, where the general effort began a little earlier, the results over a

fifteen-year period are at least comparable, and the process has grown steadily

more skillful and effective.  The slowest progress so far has been in the area

of graduate education in the arts and sciences, but even here the 1970s have

seen a convincing demonstration that greatly increased numbers of minority

students can succeed if they are energetically recruited and adequately

supported.<p>



     Racial mistrust and misunderstanding have not been exorcised by these

programs, and sensitive observers know that all concerned, white and nonwhite

alike, have a long way to go.  But there is a clear and positive relation

between effort and success in these programs, and much evidence that they are

working better now than when they began.  It is surely not an accident that the

California opinion has aroused affected groups and institutions to the

submission of a wholly unprecedented number of briefs defending the use of

racial considerations as a necessary means of enlarging the enrollment of

nonwhite students in selective institutions.  One of the most important of

these briefs is the one filed by the federal government on September 19 after

intense and prolonged debate, a brief strongly opposing the California

decision.<p>

<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>B</font>UT the California decision also has its passionate supporters, and it is

important to understand the strong and honorable forces, social and legal, that

have brought this situation before the Supreme Court.<p>



     The moral and intellectual standing of those who complain against special

admissions is not in doubt.  When we find on the same side men as different as

Justice Douglas and the late Alexander Bickel of Yale, and when a Court that

has earned respect and even criticism for its liberalism comes down as hard as

has the Supreme Court of California, we must understand what troubles them so

much.<p>



   The first and strongest of their contentions is simply that both in the

law and in common feeling there has developed a heavy suspicion of any program,

whatever its motive, which gives members of one race any advantage over members

of another on account of race alone.  Ironically but understandably, the most

sweeping and eloquent expressions of this sentiment may have come from the

leaders in the battle for black civil rights.<p>



     In 1947 Thurgood Marshall himself, then the director of the Legal Defense

and Educational Fund of the NAACP, denounced the classification by race under

which the laws of Texas deprived Herman Sweatt of admission to law school:

"There is no understandable factual basis for classification by race, and under

a long line of decisions by the Supreme Court, not on the question of Negroes,

but on the Fourteenth Amendment, all courts agree that if there is no rational

basis for the classification, it is flat in the teeth of the Fourteenth

Amendment."  As we shall see, the defenders of special admissions programs

argue strongly today that the use of racial classifications in those programs

is not only rational but necessary for compelling purposes, but what deserves

emphasis first is that it is easy to relate both the logic and the feeling of

Thurgood Marshall's outburst in Texas to the reaction of those who feel that

when it comes to choosing who shall be a doctor, there is no rational basis for

using color as a test.<p>



     A closely related objection to special admissions is that they seem to

many to require the use of racial quotas.  There has been much haggling about

the difference between goals and quotas, and I shall argue that the distinction

is not trivial, but when in fact a fixed number of places is reserved for

qualified minorities (the situation at Davis), it becomes hard to deny that

some spaces that would otherwise be open to all are now closed off to whites.

One cannot miss the fervor in the opinion of Justice Mosk for the California

court:  "No college admission policy in history has been as thoroughly

discredited in contemporary times as the use of racial percentages.  Originated

as a means of exclusion of racial and religious minorities from higher

education, a quota becomes no less offensive when it seems to exclude a racial

majority."  The fervor is underlined, if anything, by the rhetorical excess of

the suggestion that a majority that has a full and open chance at 84 percent of

the places available is "excluded."<p>



     Not surprisingly, it is Professor Bickel who is most eloquent of all.

Nothing in the briefs supporting Mr. Bakke's claim is as strong as the argument

Bickel put forth in DeFunis.  He tells us flatly that it is quite simply

wrong<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

to require the employment or the admission to a school or to any other

position of unqualified or less qualified persons solely on the basis of their

race.  When this is done, a cost is paid in loss of efficiency and in

injustice... [I]n a society in which men and women expect to succeed by hard

work:  and to better themselves by making themselves better, it is no trivial

moral wrong to proceed systematically to defeat this expectation;  the more so

as for some groups that do not now benefit from affirmative action programs

prejudice has only recently been overcome, and the expectation that members of

such groups might rise by merit has just begun to be fully met... [T]o reject

an applicant who meets established, realistic, and unchanged qualifications in

favor of a less qualified candidate is morally wrong, and in the aggregate,

practically disastrous.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



     Driven by convictions like these, Justice Douglas (in a separate opinion

on the merits in DeFunis) reached the conclusion that any admissions program

must fail unless it is handled in a "racially neutral way" (his emphasis).

Sharing this judgment, and quoting liberally from the Douglas opinion, the

California Supreme Court reached the same conclusion:  Whatever the processes

of admission, they must be racially neutral.  Whatever methods and standards

are used, they must be "applied without regard to race."<p>



     To the average reader, all this may seem fair enough. Why then is it so

shocking to the institutions that would be principally affected? The reason is

simple, if also painful:  the gaps in social, economic, educational, and

cultural advantage between racial minorities and the white majority are still

so wide that there is no racially neutral process of choice that will produce

more than a handful of minority students in our competitive colleges and

professional schools.<p>



     Let us stay with medical schools and blacks alone and look back at 1967-

1968, the last year before special admissions began to be significant.  In that

year there were 735 blacks in medical schools, but 71 percent of them had been

admitted by ways that were far from racially neutral:  they were at Howard and

Meharry, then and now the country's two predominantly black medical schools.

Out in the broad white world of a hundred other medical schools, the 211 blacks

enrolled in all four classes were only 0.6 percent of the total, though blacks

are about 12 percent of the total population.  Today, as a consequence of a

nation-wide ten-year effort, there are some 3000 blacks, 5 percent of the

total, in the mainly white medical schools.  It is an extraordinary

transformation.  And what most close observers believe is that if these same

mainly white medical schools were driven back to "racially neutral" admissions,

the number of blacks would slide back close to where it was in 1968.  A

parallel impact would be felt in other professional schools and in selective

colleges. The consequences of such a backsliding, both to the aspirations of

racial minorities and to the honorable efforts of whites, are mildly described

by the word catastrophic.  The message would go out, to something like one

sixth of our nation, that all the words of a generation since Brown are

hollow--that the educational doors are to be neutrally open, but only to an

overcrowded staircase on which nearly all of those with a head start will be

white.<p>



     The reasons for this conclusion are both multiple and simple.  First, we

must agree that selective college and professional schools do want entering

students who are not merely qualified but highly qualified.  They have learned

that when other things are equal, the applicant with the better academic record

and the better test scores is more likely to succeed.  Records and scores must

be handled with care, and it is easy to make too much or too little of them.

It is much less easy to deny the reality they tend to reflect:  that developed

capacity for certain kinds of analysis, familiarity with certain kinds of

knowledge, successful experience of certain kinds of mental effort, and natural

exposure to a social environment in which those things are encouraged are all

strongly relevant to a person's promise.  In America today disadvantaged racial

minorities are still greatly underrepresented among those best qualified on

these criteria alone.  The burden of centuries has not been lifted in the short

and stressful decades since Brown.  Selective colleges and professional schools

admitting students as they admitted them fifteen years ago would soon be nearly

lily-white again.<p>



     This result is not desired by the California Supreme Court, nor indeed by

most of those who have been stirred to the support of DeFunis and Bakke.  The

most zealous of these supporters usually insist that the need to increase

educational opportunities for disadvantaged minority students is a social

imperative.  Both Justice Douglas and the California Supreme Court have shown

such concern, and the latter went so far as to suggest a variety of "racially

neutral" activities which it thought might do the job, from building more

medical schools to general concern for the disadvantaged of all races.  But the

California court offered almost no evidence to buttress its suggestions, and on

this issue the reply of the university, in its brief before the Supreme Court,

is devastating. It demonstrates plainly that at present any method of choice or

recruitment which is racially neutral will produce a disproportionate number of

white candidates.  It shows that as a group whites outnumber nonwhites at all

levels of advantage and disadvantage;  on any criteria that are truly nonracial

they will surely get all but a very few of the places.  Moreover, this

demonstration conforms entirely with the experience of other selective

institutions.<p>



     Among those who have worked hardest and longest on this matter, the

agreement is overwhelming.  If you want to enlarge the numbers of minority

students in selective colleges and professional schools you simply must make

race a factor in your work.  You must target blacks and Hispanics and others in

your recruiting:  you must assess their promise in the light of the specific

disadvantage that their race itself still carries.  If you wish to attract

well-qualified candidates you must earn a reputation for real accessibility;

you must become known as a place that accepts minorities in more than token

numbers.  You must then spend time and money well beyond your normal standards

in helping them survive and succeed.  Precisely because it is not yet "racially

neutral" to be black in America, a racially neutral standard will not lead to

equal opportunity for blacks.<p>



     That race must be one factor in fair admissions does not of itself

determine how that factor should be weighed, or what process would come closest

to fairness at all.  Neither can it be asserted that race is the only form of

disadvantage that needs special attention.  There are whites who deserve

special help and blacks who do not.  Not everyone would endorse as wise the

particular method of affirmative action chosen by the medical faculty at Davis.

The university itself now recognizes that it was misleading to describe the

program at the beginning as open to all disadvantaged applicants, when in fact

its real purpose was to find and enroll the best qualified members of racial

minorities.  And there is a real distinction between quotas and goals which is

worth preserving and which may have been partly obscured at Davis.  Goals are

targets you set out to meet and perhaps exceed by finding genuinely qualified

people, but you are not rigidly bound by them.  Certainly quotas have at times

been invidious ceilings.  They can also be regarded as a number of places open

by right without regard to quality;  there is a hint of that in some of the

pressure-group politics of some blacks and Chicanos in California.  The notion

of a fixed quota also carries with it a flavor of the absolute that may be

inappropriate in a process which otherwise seeks to emphasize the wide variety

of considerations taken into account, and to make decisions candidate by

candidate, at least when the issue is close. (Indeed, the more one thinks about

selective admissions the more one wonders whether it is not due process, rather

than equal protection, that should be the final test of fairness.)<p>



     But the fact that a distinction is important on other grounds may not make

it useful for judges.  The word "quota" is offensive because it was animated

originally by a desire to exclude.  "Goal" is a good word, implying an effort

to attract and enroll a needed kind of person.  Yet both operationally and

constitutionally the distinction between them may be too fine for the Court.<p>



This year Professor Gordon Sabine of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute has

reviewed successful programs of special admissions in five selective colleges

(public and private, eastern and midwestern).  Over a dozen years these

institutions together have increased their nonwhite enrollments from about 225

to nearly 2700.  Mr. Sabine found that while none of them had rigid quotas

either as ceilings or floors, all of them had used broad targets and believed

that such targets were essential to their success--to ensure the necessary

administrative effort, to permit planning for financial aid budgets, and to

produce a sense of real opportunity among applicants.  And targets that are met

do result in the reduction of the opportunities of other candidates, just as

surely as quotas.  It is not surprising that Bakke's friends at court appear in

the end to be as hostile to one as to the other.  Indeed it is not hard to

imagine goals or targets more offensive in their real consequences than the

procedure at Davis, whatever its proper name.<p>



     Yet the difference between quotas and goals remains real, and it was near

the heart of the heated debate over the Bakke brief filed for the United

States.  The first draft of that brief contained an extended and powerful

attack on quotas.  The government finally decided, I think correctly, that the

record does not show clearly just what the Davis procedure was.  The government

dropped its long discussion of quotas and confined itself to an equally

powerful and extensive argument supporting the constitutionality of

"minority-sensitive" admissions programs.  It expressly avoided "reasonable

selected numerical targets for minority admissions."  But it also sharply

contrasted such targets with "rigid exclusionary quotas," and its eventual view

of quotas is not likely to be friendly.  In effect the Justice Department's

brief constitutes a strong invitation to all selective institutions to place

themselves well on the safe side of the fine line separating goals and

quotas.<p>



     To most of those who believe in making room for minorities in selective

institutions, it is not the Davis program in itself that must be saved--it is

rather the argument of the California Supreme Court that must not stand.  There

is force in the university's claim that its method, as now announced and

understood, is both forthright and effective, and no one who has close

experience of the formidable complexities and costs of any process of selective

admission will regard these as trivial advantages.  (Justice Douglas, perhaps

because he was forty years away from his own direct experience of the matter

took a particularly cavalier view of such considerations, although he himself

recommended "a separate classification" of minority applications.)  Still,

there are many successful programs of affirmative action that are different

from the one at Davis.  What does not exist, in any selective college or

professional school, is a successful program of affirmative action which has

been arranged in a racially neutral, a truly color-blind, way. Those who

believe in racially neutral ways to help racial minorities in selective

colleges and professional schools simply cannot have it both ways.  Their

motives are admirable, but they are demanding the impossible.<p>



     The infirmity of the California court's argument goes even further.  If

affirmative action is required to be racially neutral in the field of

admissions, why not also in all remedial work, whether before or after

admission?  Does the Constitution bar federal programs like that of the

National Science Foundation, which has provided millions of dollars to help

minorities prepare for medical school admission?  Does it forbid what the

schools themselves have done to help keep minorities on track, or what law

schools, with federal help, have done in summer study programs for minorities

interested in the law, or what the American Association of Medical Colleges has

done to help members by maintaining a Minority Student Registry?  Is it

racially un-neutral simply to go looking for blacks if you don't look equally

hard at everyone else?<p>



     More broadly, there is great relevance in the large set of situations

reflected in the federal case now called Adams v. Califano, which has yet to

reach the Supreme Court.  This case responds to the reality that in public

higher education in six southern states there is much that is still separate

and unequal.  A remedy is clearly needed, and the federal courts have required

the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to set guidelines for that

remedy.  The guidelines issued in July by Secretary Califano are too complex

for detailed review, but one aspect of their nature is evident throughout:

they are not racially neutral.  They reflect the disparity that plainly exists

in the present opportunities of blacks and whites in these institutions and

they require that explicit attention be given to the needs of both groups.

They claim to be fair, but they are not color-blind.  The special world of

these particular institutions, of course, is one where there is an ample

history of past discrimination, and such history has acquired its own meaning

in the legal precedents.  But it requires no leap of fancy to discern a

parallel between what was done actively and explicitly in these cases and what

was done passively and tacitly in a general context of racial inequality,

throughout our educational system.<p>



     A final thought suggests itself as we consider the call for "racial

neutrality":  the phrase lends itself to nonsensical responses.  One, as

counsel have noted, would be to draw winners from among the qualified be lot.

Another, hypothetically, might have been the development of a pair of equally

treated student bodies, white and nonwhite, with openings in racially

proportionate numbers.  In California such a method might by now have produced

minority medical students at a rate of 25 percent of the total.  Is it not of

some interest that such a program would surely have been thought constitutional

at least between 1896 (Plessy) and 1950 (Sweatt)?  Solutions like these are

defensibly neutral but clearly foolish.  So the more one thinks about it, the

less it is possible to believe that the way to get beyond the stubborn problem

of racism is to be neutral about the realities it has produced.<p>

<br>

<br>



<font size=5>S</font>O far we may have established the importance of action to increase

minority enrollment and we may even have made good our claim that this simply

cannot be done in a racially neutral way.  But the two hurdles we recognized at

the outset remain:  Is it not somehow wrong to admit "less qualified" people

because of race, and is it not doubly wrong to reserve space for them at the

inescapable expense of others in the competition?<p>



     Let us begin with the matter of qualification.  Here we must deal with two

quite different issues, one simple and the other subtle.  The simple one is

probably also the more important:  the friends of affirmative action can and

should stipulate their strenuous opposition to the admission of students who

will not be able to do the work required for graduation, and whose degree must

be either withheld or awarded on a weakened standard.<p>



     We should take it for granted that there is no gain to anyone in the

graduation of unqualified persons, men or women who will never make good

lawyers or doctors or teachers.  We should recognize, moreover, that the

acceptable floor for entry may, in some measure, and by some measurement, go up

over time, at least if these professions remain in very high demand.  We may

well doubt that there are more great lawyers now than in the age of Hughes and

Holmes, or Marshall and Webster, but we should not be surprised if there are

more good ones;  and a good one is much better, for his clients and for the

profession, than one who is not good.  The case against producing low-grade

physicians and surgeons is at least as strong.<p>



     So it becomes a matter of decisive importance that if minority candidates

are to have special consideration, they must first be qualified for admission.

This is a test which the litigating institutions have accepted and claim to

meet.  But honesty compels the recognition that however it may be now at the

Davis Medical School, and however it may have been at the Washington Law School

in 1971, there have been times and places in the last decade in which a close

examination of the qualifications and performance of some minority students

would have been embarrassing.  On this point we need not question motive;  if

some admissions and degree decisions may have been cynically patronizing,

others were well-intentioned and merely naive.  Yet we know from the eloquent

protests of such black leaders as Kenneth Clark and Roy Wilkins that an

insulting double standard can exist, and also that it is as repellent to blacks

as it is offensive to the general sense of justice.<p>



     But what is most important is that on the limited evidence we have there

is much less of this sort of thing now than there was in the first heat of

awakened concern (and perhaps less at any time than courthouse or hospital

rumors suggest).  While both the court record and the judicial precedents are

silent on the point, the weight of the evidence available elsewhere suggests

that a steadily growing percentage of the men and women of minority origin who

are admitted to selective colleges, law schools, medical schools, and graduate

schools are "making it."  Schools are choosing with more skill and giving

better support to those who enroll.  Some fail or drop out, as some (but

relatively fewer) whites do.  But the rates of minority attrition are now

reported to be roughly comparable to the failure and dropout rate of white

males some thirty or forty years ago.  Middle-aged men who received their own

professional training at about that time can fairly be asked to consider

whether a class with records as good as their own should be considered as

underqualified.<p>



     I labor this point because both logic and sentiment suggest that it may be

central to the thinking of a great many Americans, however little it may appear

in records and arguments.  No one is arguing for the admission of the

unqualified, and there is no finding in Bakke that such admissions have

occurred.  Indeed, there is not in Bakke any serious legal challenge to the

generally accepted proposition that the elemental decision on whether a

candidate is qualified for medical school must be left to the professional

judgment of faculties and their agents.<p>



     So the issue actually presented to the Supreme Court is also the issue

presented as a matter of real choice in our whole system of higher education.

The question is not, as emotion so often suggests, whether we should push

forward unqualified people.  The question is much more subtle:  Among the

qualified, how shall we choose?<p>



     The test, as Bakke and his many friends see it, is comparative.  Their

claim, asserted in varying temper and emphasis, is triple:  that their man is

more qualified than some who were preferred at least in part because of race;

that in any general process of admission the more qualified should be preferred

to the less qualified;  and that, above all, in making such choices between

individuals the Constitution requires color blindness.<p>



     We are near the center of the matter.  Let us recognize the reality:  in

affirmative action to admit more members of racial minorities, there are and

will be measurable differences, among those admitted between the average test

scores and academic records of minorities and those of whites.  The scores and

records of blacks and other minorities are such that this result is

inescapable, at least for the present.  A similar relative weakness in test

scores has existed in other groups in the past and has been gradually overcome.

There is also a clear relation between low scores and low socio-economic

status, which hits racial minorities with particular force.  Of course not all

members of racial minorities have low scores or poor records, just as not all

are culturally or economically disadvantaged.  There is indeed a growing pool

of applicants who are black or brown and bright by any test.  Nonetheless, the

average scores for most racial minorities are lower than the comparable scores

for whites.<p>



     But does it follow, as Professor Bickel seems to have thought, that to

admit such lower-scoring minority applicants is "morally wrong" and

"practically disastrous"?  Does a difference in such "established, realistic,

and unchanged qualifications" mean that those who fall short on these

measurements are "less qualified"?  Or does it mean only that when one prefers

a candidate who is weaker in such relatively measurable qualifications, one

must have some good and solid reason?  Race for a moment aside, the latter

standard is clearly the right one.  Sensitive admissions officers agree that

while scores and records can tell you a lot at the upper and lower margins,

they give little guidance in the hard cases of choice among those who are

academically qualified but not extraordinary.<p>



     There is much confusion about scores and records, and their full meaning

is not understood by anyone.  But among the recognized experts, both friendly

and critical, there is something close to agreement that they do not constitute

an absolute guide to later performance.  To read their portent is still an art

and not a science.  It is quite true that at the heights and depths they are

relatively reliable predictors, at least of academic performance, and that is

why the experienced admissions officer will need unusual reasons to deny those

near the top or admit those near the bottom on these measurements.  To read

these numbers may be an art, but that does not make them harder to use than

letters of recommendation or interviews.  It is not the perfection of the tests

and records so much as the expensive imperfection of all other methods that has

given them weight, especially in professional schools.<p>



     Closely examined, neither records nor test scores nor any criterion of

admission whatever can be accurately characterized by Professor Bickel's heavy

phrase;  there are no such things as "established, realistic, and unchanged

qualifications."  Even where records and tests have been used most mechanically

it has been only because of their relative advantage;  among thoughtful

admissions officers it has always been agreed that when time permitted and

educational need required, it was right to look at other things.  I put the

point most gently.  Especially at the undergraduate level, most admissions

officers will say that mechanical reliance on any such measurement is what

would be "morally wrong" and "practically disastrous."  Recognizing their

fallibility, knowing they will make mistakes and commit unfairness, they

nonetheless reach out to try to identify promise and quality of all sorts.

They look at other things, not only for help at the margins, but because they

think these other things are critical to the quality of the student body as a

whole.<p>



     Now we are right at the heart of it.  Is race itself permissibly such

another thing to look at?  If I am a qualified black (in the basic sense

already discussed), may not my blackness perhaps make me more qualified?  Have

I had something extra to go though?  If I score 550 where a middle-class white

scores 650, have I shown as much or more of what is so critical to success in

learning--a determination to learn?  Can I bring a different and needed

perspective?  Is there a special need for people like me in courts and

hospitals and on college faculties?  May the profession itself be better if

more people of my race are in it?  Can my presence and participation as a

student enlarge the educational experience of others?  Does the whole society

somehow have a need for me in this profession that it simply does not have,

today, for one more white?  If the answer to these questions, or some of them,

is yes, are not my qualifications by that much improved, and improved precisely

by my blackness?  If so, at some point it becomes right that I should be

admitted;  I am not "less qualified" when all things are considered.<p>



     I put this case by questions because I wish to emphasize that it is not

necessary here to be dogmatic in response to dogma.  It is quite enough to

argue that it would be a dangerous and sweeping business, in the present state

of our knowledge and experience, to answer all these questions in the negative.

Yet that is precisely what Professor Bickel's argument and the opinion of the

California court would require.<p>



     Surely one may hope that the Supreme Court will reject such certainty,

expressed as it was by men admittedly inexpert in judging the needs of

California medicine.  It is not from exposure to the social reality of medicine

and health care in that state, but only from an inverse reading of what has

been said and done judicially to protect racial minorities, that one can reach

the California court's conclusion.  (This inversion gives a

through-the-looking-glass quality to many of the briefs on both sides;  Bakke's

friends in particular constantly remind the Supreme Court of things it said

when its object was precisely to prevent the exclusion of minorities.)<p>



     To be a member of a disadvantaged racial minority may not in itself be a

positive qualification for entry into medical school in California.  But how

can the California court be so sure?  And if it is not so sure, how can it say

that the Constitution compels racial neutrality?  Yet if racial neutrality must

be required of the medical school at Davis, must it not be required everywhere

else in public, and maybe also private, higher education?  Would it not be

necessary also in all forms of affirmative action all through our society?  Is

this what Allan Bakke's grievance requires of the Constitution?<p>

<br>

<br>



<font size=5>B</font>UT what about quotas, or even goals?  Are they not arbitrary and

discriminatory?  Certainly they could be, if unqualified candidates were

admitted or if their numbers went beyond the compelling needs of the profession

or the state.  There is no such claim in Bakke;  at Davis about one sixth of

the places were held for qualified members of minorities, who make up about a

quarter of the state's population.  Even if it really was the minority entrants

who beat Bakke out, and even though his scores were better than theirs, still,

as long as one grants that to be black or Chicano can be in itself a

qualification, the program does not seem excessive.  Indeed, it is not the

sixteen places that are denounced by Bakke and his supporters--it is the award

of any admission at all on grounds even partly related to race.  It is not the

size of the space reserved, or even its existence, that is the ultimate basis

of the invocation of "equal protection."  What Bakke and his friends assert is

that race must play no part in selective admissions, and they may feel

themselves forced to this argument because no other will justify their appeal

for constitutional protection.<p>





     Thus Bakke and the California court are asserting an absolute claim when

what we really face here is conflicting values which have to be compared in

weight.  There can be no doubt at all that if the number of nonwhites goes up

in selective schools and colleges, the number of whites will go down.  Some

will be rejected who would otherwise have been accepted.  But what needs

attention is the magnitude of this consequence.<p>



     Set Bakke himself to one side for a moment and consider the net damage to

disappointed white applicants, as a group, arising from the nationwide

admission of racial minorities to medical schools. (This is a reasonable course

even in considering Bakke as an individual, because he applied not only to

Davis, with its relatively large and rigid goal for minorities, but to a number

of other medical schools with other kinds of programs. He wants to be a doctor.

not a Davis graduate.)  In 1975-1976, there were just under 35,000 white

applicants for medical school, and 22,000 of them were not accepted.  In the

same year the total number of minority candidates accepted and enrolled was

1400.  If not one minority candidate had been accepted, the entering classes

throughout the country could have accommodated less than 7 percent of the

disappointed whites. In this raw statistical sense, at least 93 percent of the

majority's problem lies in something else.<p>



     The most important "something else" is a simple excess of demand over

supply. More people of all sorts want to be doctors than ever before, and for

powerful reasons.  In the last ten years the number of formal applicants has

increased by 130 percent, while the number of places available has increased by

only 66 percent.  And these figures undoubtedly understate the change, because

as the pressure for admission grows, the number of those who select themselves

out of the competition and do not apply must be growing.  This is no new

phenomenon; even in the 1950s as much as one third of any given freshman class

at Harvard College announced a desire to enter medicine, and it was one of the

healthy functions of the undergraduate course in organic chemistry to reduce

this percentage and thus spare some of this talent for other pursuits.  The

doctor is respected, well paid, and helpful to mankind, why should not growing

numbers of ambitious and able young people seek to follow this high calling?

And since it is a stubborn fact that the country cannot and will not create

medical schools for all, there is a crunch in the admissions office.  In this

situation there can be no absolute right of admission.<p>



Most of the competition the white males face comes from other white males, but

it is interesting that even if one persists in pitting white males against

others, their most dangerous rivals, quantitatively, are not specially admitted

black or Hispanic males, but women of all races.  Since 1968 the number of

women entering medical schools has risen from 8 percent to 25 percent of the

total. A parallel increase has occurred in law schools.  No constitutional

issue is raised by this dramatic change, which is probably not at an end;  the

women admitted have had generally competitive records on the conventional

measures.  But their new presence is certainly a large part of the social

reality which can create, at least temporarily, a sense of some frustration

among ambitious white males.  The 4000 young women who have entered medical

school this year have a lot more to do with the rejection of men like Bakke

than any special admissions program for minorities.<p>



     But let us return to Bakke:  it is not statistics alone that suggest the

fault assignable to minority admissions programs in his case is small.  It is

evident in the history of his effort, if not in the appellate arguments, that

his central trouble was his age.  He was ten years older than the ordinary

candidate for admission.  Medical education is a prolonged affair at best, and

the profession has been troubled for years by the fact that even if a student

proceeds promptly along all the usual tracks--college, medical school,

internship, and often specialty boards--he or she can be well in the thirties

before being fully prepared for practice.  Bakke would have been over forty at

best, and rightly or wrongly this fact was a considerable handicap to him.<p>



     Conversely, what is most impressive about Bakke is not his scores but his

determination.  It seems at least possible, from the admittedly fragmentary

evidence, that the authorities at Davis would have made a better judgment to

admit Allan Bakke precisely because he so clearly cared so much;  moreover, his

health and energy levels appear to be high enough to justify some flexibility

in considering his age.  And it can be argued today that whether he wins or

loses his legal case, he has made sacrifices in fighting it which somehow ought

to win for him even now what he has wanted most in life--a chance to be a

doctor.<p>



     Both Bakke's age and his determination are largely absent from the legal

arguments.  Constitutionally they do not seem to count.  But they are what

really mattered in his case.  Together they are a powerful concrete

demonstration of the difficulty of the art of choice among those qualified.<p>



     Thus both general and specific evidence, not reached by the legal

arguments, combine to suggest that any hurt sustained by whites in general or

Bakke in particular is only doubtfully and marginally related to special

admission of minorities.  Moreover, there is no way of avoiding some such

displacement if in fact there are to be more nonwhites in medical schools.

Since everyone except perhaps Bakke himself appears to agree that more

qualified nonwhites are in fact needed, there is a flavor of Catch-22 about the

arguments of his friends and the California court.  They want more blacks, and

that means fewer whites, but any program that produces more blacks by

considering blackness in any way is by that very fact unconstitutionally

unfair!  Can this kind of thinking lead to sound constitutional law?<p>

<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>G</font>IVEN the magnitude of the issues presented, it is a matter of more than

technical interest that the path from Bakke's real situation to the racial

cause asserted in court is so long and tenuous.  As lawyers on both sides have

noted, the record is thin.  From what is formally before the Supreme Court

there is no way of knowing whether the Davis program has truly embodied all the

right reasons and good intentions expressed in Professor Mishkin's brilliant

brief for the university (and put forward more generally in this article), no

way of knowing whether Bakke has suffered injury from it, and certainly no way

of supporting the claim of the California Supreme Court that there are, or may

be, racially neutral paths to the desired and desirable result.<p>



     As it considers its judgment, therefore, the Court may wish to compare the

record before it with the situation faced by nine other justices twenty-five

years ago, as they began consideration of the cases eventually decided, by a

somewhat different nine, two years later in the classic case of Brown.  First,

it may note that the case of Brown against Topeka was one of five decided at

once, cases from as many school districts in different parts of the South and

border regions.  Then it may note the long line of directly relevant cases

painfully argued along the way, bearing the names of individuals whose

situation was always clearly and directly connected to the discriminatory

practice under attack: Murray in Maryland (1936);  Gaines in Missouri (1938);

Sipuel in Oklahoma (1948);  Sweatt in Texas;  and McLaurin in Oklahoma (1950).

When the Supreme Court in Brown decided that legally segregated public schools

would not do, it had considered out-of-state alternative small segregated

professional schools, admission with physical isolation, and five quite

different public school situations.  It had required argument and re-argument

as it gradually prepared itself to judge.  It had before it a legal record

almost twenty years deep and as wide as segregation itself.  And in a still

wider sense it was ready to confront the overwhelming evidence of more than

half a century that separate but equal schooling, the means of equal protection

authorized by Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896, was a fraud.  But, as the Brown

opinion shows, the Court was acting at a time when constitutional analysis was

thin.  The governing case was still Plessy, and it had not been a fertile

source of thoughtful constitutional law.<p>



     Today the situation is reversed. The Court has in its purview literally

thousands of pages of abstract constitutional analysis spurred by Marco DeFunis

and Allan Bakke.  At the same time, at least in the strict sense of what is in

the record, it is faced by an almost empty slate.  It is not only pragmatic

laymen who must ask if this is a base strong enough to sustain a decision of

such transcendent importance, or whether there should not be a much longer and

wider record before special admissions are judged.<p>



     But just once more, what of the threat of goals or quotas?  Let it be

granted that today special admissions present no serious threat to whites as a

group--and still less to any minority within that majority.  What of the

principle?  What if, one day, every self-defined ethnic or cultural minority

should demand its own quota?  Cannot all of us be defined as members of some

such minority?  And what if, then, the individual opportunities open to every

American should be compressed within some narrow racial or ethnic percentage?

While no one can say that this is happening today, the possibility clearly

worries many.<p>



     But quite aside from the compelling and constitutionally recognized

difference between being nonwhite and belonging to any other group whatever,

there is no constitutional warrant for preventing a hypothetical future hazard

at the expense of present urgent needs.  Circumstances do change the balance of

forces, and a marginal preference which is fair and perhaps even required in

one context could, in another, be a flagrant denial of equal protection.  A

decision to allow what is reasonable today is not a decision to permit abuse

tomorrow, not "while this Court sits."<p>

<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>S</font>TEPPING back from the Bakke case, and from the questions directly

presented to the Court, we can see that the forces at work here are vast,

complex, and slow.  The most persistent of all the attractive illusions in our

country may be that racism can be ended by one single blow.  Another of our

cherished notions is that everyone can have what he deserves or even what he

wants, especially in the field of education.  Precisely because our dream is of

equal chances for all, we have found it hard to recognize that in our

marvelously varied population there is enormous diversity in advantage and

disadvantage of all sorts.<p>



     Our colleges and universities in their own extraordinary variety--unique

in the world--reflect in a hundred different ways not only these differences

among us, but different ways of serving the twin ideals of equity and

excellence.  The autonomy defended for Dartmouth by Daniel Webster has been in

constructive contest with the claims of the state through all our history.  On

balance, the record does not support a judgment that our colleges and

universities would have done better if the state had interfered with them

more.<p>



     Through most of that history, most institutions of higher learning, like

the rest of America, have been blatantly racist;  the exceptions have been as

few as they have been honorable.  For only about ten years out of our two

centuries as a nation has there been a serious nationwide attempt to make room

in the higher reaches of this world for those who have been held back so long.

The results so far are uncertain, but the achievement is real, while the

asserted dangers are hypothetical.  If the process is not yet as open and

skillful as it should be, it is much more open and skillful than it was.

Faculties still insist on their responsibilities, but they are more and more

aware that there are constituencies all around them that have a right to an

accounting.  Their efforts to meet competing claims do not proceed in a vacuum.

The whole process is incomparably broader than the narrow chains of legal

reasoning which are offered to the Court, and members of the white majority are

hardly powerless in that process.  Whatever is selective will always be

imperfectly equitable, but in the absence of a persuasive showing of any grave

or general damage to basic constitutional rights, it would seem genuinely

tragic to block this great new effort at racial fairness just as it begins.<p>



     It would be almost as bad to drive it underground.  There are those who

believe that the best way of dealing with the California opinion is to pretend

to accept it, and to achieve real minority presence by assertedly neutral

means.  The process of final choice in selective institutions is always complex

and subtle, and for understandable reasons admissions officers are practiced in

husbanding their candor.  So it is not at all unlikely that in the pursuit of

their own convictions they could find ways of preferring minority candidates

while stoutly denying the preference.  A more destructive subterfuge is hard to

imagine, or one more likely to clog the courts with an unmanageable mass of

complex complaints.<p>



     I repeat that this effort is young, difficult, and hopeful.  What most

needs emphasis is its youth.  In the lives of the races, the professions, and

the universities, ten years are but a moment.  Some of those who defend

affirmative action sometimes speak as if it could be a relatively short matter.

If we measure in generations, they may be right. It seems fair to hope that we

can have made decisive progress by the time the children of today's children

are of college age.  But that single generation takes us well beyond the year

2000.  For the rest of the working lives of those who are now concerned with

these matters, persistence will be the name of the game.<p>



     No one can deny that special admissions programs, even at their best, have

costs and dangers;  the grievances of Allan Bakke and others may be overstated

and even misdirected, but they are deeply felt.  Racial preference can arouse

racial antagonism, and the general rule that judgment should be based on

personal merit alone has its high claims.  Still, it seems clear that to take

race into account today is better than to let the doors swing almost shut

because of the head start of others.  We must hope and believe that in the long

run our effort for equal opportunity will put the need for special programs

behind us.  In that deep sense there is no conflict between special admissions

and every other form of action to help the disadvantaged, white and nonwhite

alike.  But what special admissions, and only special admissions, can do today

is to make access to the learned professions a reality for nonwhites.  To get

past racism, we must here take account of race.  There is no other present way.

In the words of Alexander Heard of Vanderbilt, "To treat our black students

equally, we have to treat them differently."<p>



     It is not for a layman to tell judges how to fit these realities to the

Constitution.  In its brief to the Supreme Court, the University of California

concluded with an appeal to the authority of Paul Freund, while the private

universities turned to Daniel Webster.  My own last thought is this:  It is

right to ask of the Court in this case that it should find its way to a result

which somehow respects the reality that the world of American higher learning

is at last embarked upon a long-delayed and indispensable effort to do its part

to deal with our most deeply rooted social evil, one which was the proximate

cause of the Fourteenth Amendment itself.  To read the words of that amendment

in ways that would cripple that effort would seem a cruel irony.  What is

worse, it would be to assert that in the learned professions the equal

protection clause somehow requires the perpetuation of de facto white

supremacy.  Worst of all, it would place the great moral authority of the Court

on the wrong side of a fundamental issue, on which it has a hard-won right to

speak for the national conscience.<p>



     In asking whether the equal protection clause really requires all this, I

have found myself rereading two of the most famous of all judicial comments on

the Constitution--what it is and what it permits.  They both came from the pen

of John Marshall in 1819.<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

In considering this question, then, we must never forget, that it is a

constitution we are expounding.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





And later in the same opinion:<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the

constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to

that end, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are

constitutional.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



     If the Constitution is read in this grand manner, can it truly be

unconstitutional to make room for qualified members of racial minorities on the

staircase to the professions?<p>

<blockquote>
<font size=5>W</font>HEN the <i>Washington Post </i>media reporter Howard
Kurtz needed a title for
his recent book on daytime-television <A
HREF="http://tvnet.com/UTVL/tal_list.html">talk shows</A> (which epitomize,
in his view,
America's increasingly "run-at-the-mouth culture"), a term suggesting a
conflation of airwaves and vaporous blather was ready to hand: <A
HREF="http://www.bookscapes.com/hotair.html"><i>Hot Air </i></A>.
One rule of thumb about slang is that the more prevalent the object, activity,
or behavior being described, and the more intense its psychological salience,
the more numerous and diverse the slang terms available to describe it. The
demand for slang denoting nonsense--or, if you will, <i>applesauce, hogwash,
hokum, hooey, jive, piffle, tommyrot, </i>or <i>twaddle </i>--stems from the
fact that people talk so much of it.<p>

<img src="wordimpr.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

The first reference to <i>hot air</i>, in the sense of boasting or nonsense,
that is cited in historical dictionaries<i> </i>comes from <i>The Gilded Age </i>(1873), by <A HREF="http://web.syr.edu/~fjzwick/twainwww.html">Mark
Twain</A> and Charles Dudley Warner. The book refers to "the
hot air of the capital"--but although the association of <i>hot air </i>and
Washington seems fitting, it is not clear that Twain and Warner meant to do
anything other than refer to the temperature of the atmosphere. (The text is
ambiguous.) The first unequivocal citation comes from the humorist <A
HREF="http://www.spcc.com/ihsw/ade.htm">George Ade</A>'s
<i>Fables in Slang </i>(1900): "He talked what is technically known as Hot
Air." By century's end, then, the slang meaning was well established, as was
the derivative term <A
HREF="http://www.netspace.org/~mrl/projects/writing/slang.html#sec2"><i>ball
oon juice </i></A>(at least at Yale)--no doubt helped
along by the pneumatic ancestors <i>gas </i>and <i>wind</i>. <A
HREF="http://www.italgas.it/archivio/Librone.html"><i>Gas </i>was
coined in its literal sense</A> by the seventeenth-century Dutch chemist J.
B. van
Helmont, who derived it from the Greek word <i>khaos </i>, meaning, well,
"chaos." The slang meaning had developed in English by the late 1700s, and in
the nineteenth century <i>gas </i>was without question a popular word for
"empty talk." <i>Wind </i>led to <i>windies </i>, which in the American
Southwest referred to tall tales. <i>Windbags </i>and <i>gasbags </i>, of
course, are found all over.<p>
If one major class of nonsense-related slang derives, naturally enough, from
the gaseous language of breath and speech, another derives from the world of
organic liquids and solids of dubious value. In the early seventeenth century
<i>balderdash </i>was a mixture of liquors (or even of beer and
buttermilk)--beneath the notice of serious tipplers. Restoration writers
eventually applied the word to worthless rhetoric. <i>Baloney </i>made a
similar transition by 1922, after six decades as simply the name of an
inexpensive sausage made from some of the least choice cuts of meat. For
emphasis nowadays one may say <i>bull-oney </i>, creating a phonetic and
psychological link to the long-popular <i>bull </i>, and to a meadowful of
metaphors we may as well skip here.<p>
But not entirely. Old yearbooks show that cadets at <A
HREF="http://www.usma.edu">West Point</A> called voluble
talk <i>B.S. </i>as early as 1900--evidently a transparent abbreviation even
then. A more recent euphemism is <i>bull hockey</i>, which has nothing to do
with sports; newer still are <i>bull puckey </i>and the mysterious <i>bull
dinky</i>. The dismissive Americanism
 <A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/complife/print/9505/review/doc4.html">
<i>poppycock </i>has scatological
overtones in the original Dutch.</A> Though Americans today associate a curt
outburst of <i>"Poppycock!" </i>with English gentry, in truth the word was once
unfathomable in England; <A
HREF="http://theory.tifr.res.in/bombay/persons/rudyard-kipling.html">Rudyard
Kipling</A>, when recounting for English readers
in 1891 a conversation he had had in California, felt the need to substitute
the word <i>bosh</i>. The origins of the recent British favorite <A
HREF="http://www.dur.ac.uk/~dgl3djb/ukus.html#codswallop"><i>codswallop
</i></A>remain in dispute.<p>
Henry Ford told a reporter in 1916, "History is more or less
<i>bunk </i>"--short for <i>buncombe </i>, often applied to insincere political
speech. (This word is associated with <A
HREF="http://www.openweb.com/wmg/bunc_co/">Buncombe County</A>, in North
Carolina, and
an incident in which Felix Walker, an early-nineteenth-century politician from
that district, droned on and on in Congress despite entreaties from his
colleagues, insisting that he was speaking "for Buncombe.") Ford, with his
offhand remark, presaged the ahistoricism of much contemporary cultural
theory--which itself may contain no small degree of <i>malarkey </i>(origin
unknown).<p>

<blockquote>

<font size=5>N</font>O composer had a more fortunate life-span than Muzio Clementi. He 
was born in Rome in 1752, two years after <A HREF="http://www.tile.net/tile/bach/">
Bach's</a> death, while <A HREF="http://www.classicalmus.com/composers/handel.html">
 Handel</a> was still an active
figure on the musical scene of London, where Clementi would spend much of his life; he
died in 1832, a year before the birth of <A HREF="http://classicalmus.com/composers/brahms.html">
Brahms</a>, just as 
Berlioz, <A HREF= "http://classicalmus.com/composers/chopin.html">Chopin</a>, 
<A HREF="http://classicalmus.com/composers/schumann.html">Schumann</a>,
and <A HREF="http://classicalmus.com/composers/mendelss.html">
Mendelssohn</a> were getting their careers under way. In 1781 Clementi engaged in 
a piano competition with <A HREF="http://www.classicalmus.com/bmgclassics/biography/mozart.html">
Mozart</a> in Vienna, for the benefit of Emperor Joseph II; 
during the 1790s he shared the stage of London's Hanover Square Concert Rooms with
the visiting <A HREF="http://classicalmus.com/composers/haydn.html"> Haydn</a>; 
in 1807, once again in Vienna, he carried on elaborate negotiations
with <A HREF="http://www.classicalmus.com/bmgclassics/biography/beethove.html">
Beethoven</a> that resulted in his becoming the composer's principal English
publisher; and on June 21, 1824, he attended the London debut of 
<A HREF="http://www.xs4all.nl/~liszt/liszte.htm"> Franz Liszt</a>.
During most of his life he was more famous than Mozart, his reputation exceeded
only by those of Haydn and Beethoven both of whom he not only was influenced by
but also influenced. In addition, Clementi was one of the premier keyboard
virtuosos and teachers of his day, and he ran a highly successful publishing
firm that also manufactured pianos. At his death he was buried with high
ceremony in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey.<p>

Yet today Clementi's name is scarcely known. His monumental <i>Gradus ad
Parnassum </i>(1817-1826), once studied by all budding pianists, lives on only
in <A HREF="http://classicalmus.com/composers/debussy.html">Debussy's</a>
 affectionate caricature, "Dr. Gradus ad Parnassum," from the
<i>Children's Corner Suite</i>. During the 1950s 
<a HREF="http://www.music.sony.com/Music/ArtistInfo/VladimirHorowitz_Biography.
html">Vladimir Horowitz's</a> recordings
briefly revived interest in some of Clementi's sonatas, but they, too, are no
longer studied as they once were, and are seldom programmed. <p>

His other music is in a still sorrier state. Clementi wrote several vocal and
chamber works and, most important, an unknown number of symphonies, which had a
brief success but disappeared from the orchestral repertory in the late 1820s
--swept aside by the demand for Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. <p>

If Clementi's life-span was fortunate in that it put him in personal and
artistic contact with perhaps the world's three greatest composers, it was
unfortunate in that it put him in direct competition with them. His music for
both keyboard and orchestra is far better than his present low reputation
suggests. The three Viennese classical composers produced their astonishing
body of masterpieces between the mid-1770s and 1827, the year of Beethoven's
death--almost exactly the period during which Clementi was active as a
composer. <p>

That Clementi's symphonies should so long have remained unknown and unplayed,
and that even their precise number and the dates of their composition should be
obscure to us, is not only unjust but also ironic. For it was on these works
that Clementi, especially during his later years, placed his greatest hopes for
posthumous fame.<p>

<pre>

</pre>

<font size=5>C</font>LEMENTI had composed an oratorio and perhaps also a mass
by the time he was twelve; by fourteen he had been appointed the organist of his 
local church. Shortly thereafter a visiting Englishman, Peter Beckford, struck a 
deal with Clementi's father whereby he "bought" (as he later put it) the young 
composer for seven years, to serve as his music master. Beckford, a cousin of the
novelist William Beckford, the author of <i>Vathek</i>, had no special
interest in music. But in 1765, the year before his trip to Rome, he inherited
a large Dorset estate, and decided that his new position demanded a music
master. So Clementi returned with him to England in 1766 or 1767. A few sonatas
survive from this period, but Clementi seems to have spent most of his time in
solitary study and experimentation, at his harpsichord. Just what he did to
earn his keep, and when he left Dorset for London, are not known. <p>

He seems to have arrived in London in about 1774, and by the end of the 1770s
he was composing, performing, and publishing sonatas of ever-increasing
brilliance and flamboyance. By 1780 he felt ready to try his luck on the
Continent. Stopping first in Paris, he went on to Vienna and his confrontation
with Mozart. Though Clementi had high praise for Mozart's "spirit and grace,"
Mozart, in a letter to his father, ungenerously (and perhaps enviously)
dismissed Clementi as possessing "not the slightest expression or taste, still
less, feeling," and branded him "a <i>ciarlatano</i>, like all Italians." <p>

In 1784 Clementi returned to the Continent and eloped with an eighteen-year-old
girl he had met on his previous trip, the daughter of a prosperous Lyons
merchant. The enraged father pursued the couple, and with the aid of the
authorities soon reclaimed his daughter. Heartbroken, Clementi retired to Bern,
where he consoled himself by working at mathematics. By late 1784 or early 1785
he felt sufficiently restored to return to London, but lingering melancholy
apparently kept him from performing.<p>

Clementi's rejection by the merchant brought it home to him that the trade of
touring virtuoso was not quite respectable, and he resolved to set his sights
higher. The Op. 13 sonatas, which he composed at this time, are decidedly less
flamboyant, more nobly melodic and internally coherent, than his earlier ones.
This was also when he began to write symphonies, which were rapidly becoming
the most prestigious genre of musical composition. In 1786 four new Clementi
symphonies (or parts of symphonies) were performed in London. Of these we have
two, the short symphonies that were published in 1787 as Op. 18--the only
orchestral works that Clementi ever allowed to be published. <p>

In addition to raising his musical ambitions, Clementi now sought to better
himself by going into business. He was becoming the most sought-after, and most
expensive, piano teacher in London, and with the fortune thus amassed he
invested heavily in music publishing and piano manufacture, two activities that
increasingly absorbed his time and attention.<p>

Clementi's turn toward orchestral music was also influenced by Haydn's two
visits to London in the early 1790s. During the 1780s Clementi's symphonies
were frequently performed, but Haydn's arrival in 1791 suddenly landed Clementi
in a popularity contest he could not possibly win. When Haydn returned to
Vienna, in 1793, Clementi's music was again in demand; his fortunes sank once
again when Haydn reappeared in 1794, and rose the next year with the great
man's final departure.<p>

Although the two men maintained cordial relations Haydn visited Clementi's
country house at Evesham, in Worcestershire, and Clementi gave him a piece of
coconut shell trimmed with silver--Haydn was a steady irritant to Clementi. But
he must surely also have acted as inspiration and challenge, because Clementi
kept writing symphonies. During the early years of the new century (and
especially after he had become acquainted with Beethoven and his music)
Clementi did his finest surviving symphonic work. From 1816 through 1824 a long
string of mostly favorable reviews chronicles the performances of his
symphonies in London, Paris, Munich, and Leipzig.<p>

<pre>

</pre>

<font size=5>W</font>HY were these later works not published in Clementi's lifetime? 
Apparently because he kept revising and tinkering with them. In his early days a fine
youthful recklessness had led him to publish immediately almost everything he
composed. But another effect of the reassessment brought on by his aborted
elopement was to make Clementi far more cautious about the quality of the works
he sent out into the world. Thus he veered from one extreme to the other, and
became a compulsive reviser--at least of works to which he attached special
importance, like the symphonies. He carried the scores with him on his far-flung promotional trips, and they were with him when he died.<p>

The fate of these manuscripts is an obscure and tangled story. An old rumor had
it that Clementi himself destroyed them. But in 1921 the musicologist Georges
de Saint-Foix announced that by combining chunks of manuscript from two large
Clementi collections, one in the British Museum and the other in the Library of
Congress, he had made out four symphonies, an overture, and a minuet. A servant
of the composer's grandson, one of the previous owners of the manuscripts, had
evidently thrown out many by mistake; but much remained. In 1935 the composer
Alfredo Casella reconstructed two of the symphonies and conducted them in Italy
with great success. Performances were also given in this country, by the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, and in 1938 Casella's editions of the two works were
published. <p>

In 1969 the musicologist and pianist Pietro Spada began working with the
manuscripts in London and Washington. He discovered connections among various
fragments that Casella had missed. By 1978 Spada had published the four large
symphonies that apparently date from 1810-1824, two so-called
overtures that were intended as symphonic first movements, and a <i>Minuetto
Pastorale</i>, on the manuscript of which Clementi had written, "to be
shortened for another symphony in D." Modern editions of the two Op.18
symphonies and of a piano concerto that Clementi later turned into a sonata had
appeared some years earlier, and so the publication of Clementi's surviving
orchestral works was now complete.<p>

The four large symphonies were recorded almost immediately by Claudio Scimone
and the Philharmonia Orchestra, and are now available as a two-CD set (Erato 4509-92191-2). Within the past few years these symphonies, the two smaller Op.18 
symphonies, the concerto, the two overtures, and the <i>Minuetto Pastorale </i>have 
all appeared on the English ASV label, performed by Francesco D'Avalos and the
Philharmonia, with Spada as soloist in the concerto. They can be had either on
three single compact discs (ASV CD DCA 802, 803, and 804) or as a packaged set
(ASV CD DCS 322).<p>

The two early symphonies are uneven but extremely interesting experimental
works, and are quite different from each other. The one in B flat sounds almost
archaic when we recall that by 1787 Haydn had composed his six <i>Paris
</i>symphonies (Nos. 82-87). Its first movement and finale have the curiously
impersonal air of many pre-classical symphonies of a decade or more earlier. 
At only two points in the first movement does anything interesting happen: Clementi
moves into and out of the development section with oddly meditative passages in which
the melodic movement suddenly slows to a standstill and the harmony drifts.<p>

The opening movement of the symphony in D, in contrast, is, as Leon Plantinga
remarks in his excellent 1977 biography, <i>Clementi: His Life and Music</i>,
"painstakingly unorthodox." The allegro, following a solemn slow introduction,
at first seems as energetically impersonal as that of the B-flat
work. But the transition to the second theme is refreshingly contrapuntal, and
the second theme itself, a slow-moving,thoughtful melody given out softly by the
upper strings, has an almost ethereal quality. The recapitulation, astonishingly,
begins not in the expected D major but in C major. The contrapuntal transitional
passage and the second theme swap places as Clementi gradually works his way back
to the home key and a witty ending that surely owes its existence to Haydn. 
The finale is also delightfully Haydnesque.<p>

The first movement of the C-major concerto is large-mannered,
robust, and a little boring. This concerto was performed by Clementi in 1790
and was probably composed around that time, but it, too, sounds primitive. Our
ears have grown accustomed to the dazzling series of twelve concertos (K.
449-K. 503) that Mozart wrote from 1784 to 1786, and we expect something like
the subtle, ever-changing relation between soloist and orchestra that we find 
in those works. That relation is established by the very free, multi-thematic
first-movement form Mozart evolved specifically for that purpose. Clementi instead 
employs the older first-movement concerto form, in which there are two expositions,
one for the orchestra and one for the soloist, that are identical except for the key in
which the second theme is introduced. When Clementi made this work into a
sonata, all he had to do with the first movement was lop off the orchestral
exposition and alter slightly the transitions to the development and the
cadenza, and the last few bars. Anyone could have done it. But no one except
Mozart could turn the first movement of a Mozart concerto into the first
movement of a sonata. Clementi's second movement is more interesting: intimate
and freely discursive, it reminds one of the nocturnes of Chopin and of
Clementi's gifted pupil John Field. The finale is sparkling but somewhat
prosaic.<p>

<pre>

</pre>

<font size=5>T</font>HE heart of the matter is, of course, the four large symphonies
edited by Spada. They are immediately attractive works, generous and warm-hearted yet
without an ounce of sentimentality. Each lasts about half an hour--twice the
length of the Op. 18 symphonies--and is scored for a sumptuous orchestra that
includes three trombones.<p>

As one would expect, there is a good deal of Haydn in these works. In fact,
many of the fast movements sound at first like Haydn movements in which the
intensity of the wit has been diffused, the exhilarating tightness of the form
relaxed, and the form itself opened to allow time for enjoyment and
contemplation. Often Clementi dramatically produced a startling chord that in
Haydn would signal the opening of a whole new harmonic area, but then simply
picked up where he left off; the chord becomes merely a local effect rather
than a functional part of the harmonic progression. <p>

Clementi's main way of broadening and relaxing the classical forms was to
provide sudden moments of calm or even stasis. These mysterious "still points,"
which first appeared in the Op. 18 symphonies, are everywhere in the four late
works. They may derive from but are quite different from Haydn's famous
"irregularities"the sudden pauses, shifts of direction, and lengthenings or
shortenings of phrases by which Haydn created momentary surprises and delights
without losing his grip on the underlying form. At such moments Clementi seems
to have been quite willing to lose his grip for a while.<p>

It is this willingness, together with his harmonic procedures and the character of
some of his melodies, that makes it natural to group these symphonies with
Schubert's first six, the symphonies and sonatas of Carl Maria von Weber, the
concertos and sonatas of Mozart's pupil Johann Nepomuk Hummel, and the
symphonies of Louis Spohr. In these works and others written during the first
quarter of the nineteenth century the classical forms of Haydn, Mozart, and
Beethoven remain more or less unaltered externally but are softened and tamed
through a heightened concentration on local color and ornamental detail, a
tendency toward lushness of harmony and sonority, and an easygoing pace.<p>

Since these had been elements of Clementi's music for a long time, it is no
surprise that he should have made common cause with these proto-Romantic
or "classicizing" composers. Yet he differs from them in one important respect:
he belongs to an earlier musical generation. <A HREF="http://www.lmg.com/schubert/
life.htm">Schubert</a> was born in 1797, Weber
in 1786, Hummel in 1778, Spohr in 1784; Clementi (it is believed) published his
first sonatas in 1771, and he had been composing for perhaps a decade before
that. He was old enough to have been directly influenced by Bach and Handel. As
early as perhaps 1774 he acquired an autograph manuscript of the second volume
of the <i>Well-Tempered Clavier</i>, and during his early years at Dorset he 
continually studied and practiced the works of J. S. and C.P.E. Bach. The 
contrapuntal language of the High Baroque was still, for Clementi, a living 
medium of expression--not, as for Mendelssohn, an ancient tongue to be reverently
learned and preserved.<p>

Thus we find in Clementi's four late symphonies vigorous and elaborate canonic
and fugal sections cheek by jowl with the leisurely, ornate passages that
remind us of Weber and early Schubert. During his lifetime Clementi was much
praised by the English critics for his "science," by which they meant his
contrapuntal technique. A slightly later critic like Schumann not only a German
but also a Romantic composer could express concern about the apparent coldness
of Clementi's contrapuntal writing. It was Clementi's unique historical
position--together, of course, with the special bent of his enormous
gifts--that enabled him to temper and qualify classical forms with both the
contrapuntal rigors of the vanished Baroque age and the harmonic languors of
the dawning Romantic age. There is no one quite like him, and no other works
quite like these four extraordinary symphonies.<p>

They come off better in Scimone's recordings than in those conducted by
D'Avalos. D'Avalos takes them in the lean, brisk style now considered the
guarantee of "authenticity" in the performance of all late-eighteenth-century
and early-nineteenth-century music; Scimone moves easily between vigor and 
expansiveness, just as the works demand. I would fault Scimone only on his 
failure to capture the full effect of Clementi's superb orchestration, in 
particular the almost Brahmsian richness provided by the three trombones and
by the thick lower voicings of which Clementi (as in his solo keyboard works) 
was so fond. The thought of what performances by, say, Claudio Abbado and the
Berlin Philharmonic might reveal redoubles one's hopes that these symphonies 
of Clementi's will soon receive the airing, in the concert hall as well as on
records and discs, that they deserve.<p>

<blockquote>

	

	<font size=5>F</font>OR more than thirty years spy satellites launched by the United States have

been gathering a "virtual time-machine record of the earth," as Vice President

Al Gore has described it. The public has paid close to $100 billion for that

record. But national-security and personal-privacy concerns have blocked the

use of the world's most powerful sensors to make current information about

natural resources, environmental hazards, and private property in the United

<img src="Techno.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

States available to environmental scientists, government agencies, and

businesses. Because the Central Intelligence Agency is barred by federal law

from spying on Americans, it shares current environmental information about the

United States only in rare instances--for example, in response to natural

disasters. <p>

Now, though, <A HREF="http://infomanage.com/international/intelligence/spychron.html">spy-satellite technology</A> that has been used for a single

purpose--espionage--with extraordinary government controls can suddenly be used

for any purpose with few controls. In 1994, concerned about the post-Cold War

health of the U.S. aerospace industry and fearful that foreign competition

might challenge U.S. leadership in satellite technology, the Clinton

Administration decided that private companies could launch satellites with

high-resolution sensors previously available only to the intelligence

community, and could provide information to anyone willing to pay for it. As

government officials take cautious steps to share information gathered by

military satellites, four U.S. companies are racing to launch satellites of

their own equipped with similar technology. The first launch is scheduled for

later this summer.<p>



At a recent conference in Washington, D.C., Mark Brender, ABC's Pentagon

producer, predicted that precise pictures from space will revolutionize

television news, both by freeing reporters from relying on government-provided

information during international crises and by freeing viewers from relying

solely on what reporters tell them. David Bohrman, an executive producer at

NBC, demonstrated how networks could use satellite pictures to simulate

flyovers of troop encampments in Bosnia. At his command a technician in New

York using prerecorded images zoomed in on villages, scanned rivers, and

hovered over military bases, producing a moving picture that resembled a

helicopter ride around the countryside. <p>

<pre>

</pre>



<font size=5>W</font>HAT is really at stake is the ground rules for the next phase of mapping the

earth. By next year three of the four companies plan to produce images of

one-meter resolution--100 times as precise as those of current civilian

satellites. The ability to see hazy outlines of large buildings will be

replaced with the ability to see the clear shapes of small cars. The ability to

observe the same farm or city block every sixteen days will be replaced with

the ability to observe the same point every two or three days; three to six

images a day of most places in the United States are promised within four

years. <p>

Fundamental issues are being decided now. When should the government be allowed

to censor images to protect national security? Should fears of military

snooping from space be replaced with fears of snooping by corporations or

domestic agencies? Will access to satellites' most detailed pictures pass from

a small cadre of military clients with top-secret clearance to a small cadre of

corporate clients with the means to pay for them? <p>



Since commercial use of this technology is new, no one has a ready framework

for resolving questions about national security, the protection of privacy, and

public access to information. Time-tested principles that allow the government

to block information in emergencies, keep homes and their surroundings free

from intrusion, and treat geographic information as a national resource can

provide guidance--if they are heeded. The breadth of the government's power to

censor images may be decided this fall, when the Commerce Department is

expected to issue final policies setting the conditions for commercial licenses

to operate satellites. Privacy questions may be decided in an international

context: strict privacy rules adopted by the European Union last July require

consent for the use of information that identifies an individual. They may keep

companies in the United States from selling images abroad unless similar rules

are approved in this country. Access questions--whether images can be copied

and distributed to the public, for example--will probably be negotiated between

satellite companies and their customers, including government agencies. <p>

<pre>

</pre>



<font size=5>N</font>O longer simply the source of spectacular views of the 

earth, satellite images have a new capacity to influence what people do and 

how they think.  Using sophisticated software and powerful, inexpensive 

computers, businesses, government agencies, citizens' groups, and 

individuals can now produce layered maps (called <A 

HREF="http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/geo/www/faq-index.html">Geographic 

Information Systems</A>, or GIS) that combine new environmental findings 

with information already available to the public, such as property 

ownership and census data.  New satellites will make such maps more useful 

by providing high-resolution images with digital precision and offering 

predictable repeat visits.  Neither aerial photography nor current civilian 

satellites like <A 

HREF="http://l7oe01.atsc.allied.com/objective.html">Landsat</A> or the 

French SPOT can 

produce this combination.<p> The investigative powers of satellites derive 

not just from photography but from sensors measuring visible and invisible 

wavelengths of the sun's energy.  These can reveal more about an object's 

character than can be discovered standing next to it: each species of 

plant, type of soil, and kind of rock or building material, for example, 

uniquely reflects and absorbs wavelengths.  Experts add a few caveats: 

measures of reliability are critical; interpretation is complicated; and 

much of this science is still in its infancy.  And like all maps, these 

reflect the quality of underlying information.  <p>



Information from sensors can give early warning of environmental hazards. Kass

Green, the president of Pacific Meridian Resources, a mapping firm, expects

that new images will help minimize the damage done by wildfires like those that

sweep through urban areas such as Los Angeles and Oakland, California. For the

first time, she says, it will be possible to easily distinguish asphalt,

wood-shake, and synthetic-shake roofs and to assess from week to week the

dryness of vegetation around homes. Planning firebreaks and other preventive

measures depends on accurately predicting a fire's path. <p>



Satellite maps can help to settle political controversies--or create them.

When, for example, environmental groups and the Bush Administration clashed

over how much old-growth forest in the Pacific Northwest should be protected as

habitat for the spotted owl, competing layered maps produced by the Wilderness

Society and the federal Forest Service provided a basis for negotiation, by

clarifying different ways of defining old growth. New maps of Latin America

that were completed last fall by the World Wildlife Fund have led to a debate

about how to use limited conservation funds: the maps make clear that tropical

dry forests and grasslands are as important to biodiversity as rain forests,

and are more severely threatened. <p>



Satellite images can make things harder to hide. The Environmental Protection

Agency has used such images to help identify hazardous-waste sites and sources

of water pollution. European farmers, who receive crop subsidies of $50 billion

a year, have new reasons to submit accurate information: their planting

patterns are monitored from space by the European Commission. When farm

boundaries are layered over images of the countryside, infrared color codes

reveal whether a field is growing barley, wheat, corn, or something else. 

<p>

<pre>

</pre>

<font size=5>O</font>F course, newly explicit images can also be used to make mischief. Foreign

intelligence agencies are expected to be among the largest buyers of

high-resolution images. "International security issues are serious," says Ray

Williamson, a senior research scientist at the George Washington University

Space Policy Institute. "Iraq would be interested in information about Saudi

Arabia. Iran would like to see data about Israel. India and Pakistan would like

to have information about each other. If you were concerned about troop buildup

on your border, you could put in a standing order for the satellite to take a

picture every time it passed over." During international conflicts this greater

access could lessen the information advantage the United States has over other

countries. <p>

Some experts argue that expanded access could be beneficial. Neighboring

countries might be less quick to threaten each other when troop movements were

visible to all. When U.S. troops are involved in international conflicts,

though, the U.S. government has a strong interest in controlling the flow of

information. "One reason we were able to best the Iraqis," Williamson says,

"was that we had very good information about them and they didn't know what we

were doing." <p>



To minimize security risks, the U.S. government is working to keep "shutter

control"--broad latitude to turn off sensors when images might compromise

"national security, international obligations and/or foreign policies."

Representatives of television networks and other news media argue that the

government's authority to stop the use of satellite images should be no broader

than its authority to stop the publication or airing of other sensitive

information, and that exercising it should require the same judicial process.

<p>



Whatever the outcome of that debate, growing international competition means

that customers who want high-resolution images will probably be able to buy

them. The CIA has been cautious about <A HREF="http://www.nro.odci.gov/prs_rel.htm">declassifying spy-satellite pictures</A>: so

far only archives from 1960 to 1972 have been released to the public, and the

results of a joint U.S.-Russian effort to study environmentally important sites

around the world using spy satellites will be kept secret for the foreseeable

future. But Russia is already selling some current two-meter images from

military satellites, and France, Israel, and Japan plan to market

high-resolution imagery.<p>

<pre>

</pre>



<font size=5>W</font>HERE to draw the line between personal privacy and the public and commercial

need for information will become urgent when high-resolution surveillance is

routine. For the first time, detailed pictures of every piece of private

property in the United States will be routinely compiled and marketed.

Commercial satellites cannot yet produce images of people, but they can show

vehicles parked in driveways and structural changes to homes. They can provide

images within a few hours and exact comparisons of the same property at precise

intervals without giving clues about their presence--things that aerial

photography cannot do. <p>



For the police, precise images mean a new investigative tool, says James Frelk,

the vice-president of <a href="http://www.digitalglobe.com/">EarthWatch</a>, the

company that plans the first new

satellite launch. Officers monitoring a suspected crack house, for example,

will be able to see the pattern of vehicles arriving and leaving. "They can see

the difference between a van, a truck, and a car," Frelk says, "and make a good

guess about whether the same car was there yesterday." He expects local

governments to be regular customers for other uses, such as updating tax

assessments and spotting additions to homes and outbuildings that are in

violation of building codes.<p>



The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution has traditionally been understood to

protect homes and the areas immediately surrounding them from unreasonable

government intrusion; laws of trespass have protected against snooping by

businesses or individuals. In the days before electronic wizardry, that meant

freedom from physical entry. When wiretapping and hidden microphones made

intrusion possible without breaking down doors or climbing fences, the idea of

privacy became more subjective. The Constitution was then taken to mean that

areas where individuals have "a reasonable expectation of privacy," including

homes and yards, must remain free of government intrusion--physical or

electronic.<p>



But in the past ten years judicial support for the use of aerial photography to

spot marijuana crops in the war against drugs has left doubt about whether any

outdoor space can be considered private. The last time the Supreme Court ruled

on the question, in 1986, it upheld the legality of an aerial backyard search

that produced pictures of a stand of marijuana plants, hidden from view on the

ground by a ten-foot-high fence. In the war against drugs "one of the

casualties has been the Fourth Amendment," says Yale Kamisar, a professor of

constitutional law at the University of Michigan and a leading authority on

privacy issues. Most constitutional scholars agree that increasingly

sophisticated technology is no justification for lessening the protection of

privacy in one's home and yard. Yet courts continue to uphold warrantless

searches of yards by means of aerial surveillance, even though the searches

would be illegal if the police jumped a fence. "We have much less privacy than

we think," Kamisar says. "If the Fourth Amendment doesn't adapt to new

technology, it's going to wither and die."<p>



Corporate privacy, too, is shrinking. On the same day that it upheld the aerial

search for marijuana plants, the Supreme Court ruled on a case in which

inspectors from the Environmental Protection Agency sought entry without a

warrant to the 2,000-acre Dow Chemical plant in Midland, Michigan, in order to

check emissions from power plants and take photographs, and were denied it. The

inspectors then rented a plane and took seventy-five color photos using an

aerial mapping camera; the Court found that inspection using aerial photography

did not violate the Constitution.<p>



Confusing matters further, the Court left clues that government satellite

surveillance might be an invasion of privacy even when aerial photography is

not. The majority said that "surveillance of private property by using highly

sophisticated surveillance equipment not generally available to the public,

such as satellite technology, might be constitutionally proscribed absent a

warrant." In each of the two cases four dissenting justices thought that there

should be more protection of privacy than the Court provided.<p>



Other threats to privacy arise when scattered public information is combined

with precise images of homes or farms. A new wing on a house, a trip to the

Caribbean, and a few major purchases could together signal a change in

lifestyle of interest to tax collectors, business partners, or ex-spouses.

Farmers competing for high yields could profit from a week-by-week record of a

neighbor's success in using irrigation, fertilizers, and pesticides. New

satellites will make information accessible on personal computers within

hours.<p>



Congress and state legislatures have in some instances restricted the free flow

of information among companies and between government agencies and companies.

Self-restraint by businesses and government agencies, too, can go a long way

toward avoiding consumers' worst nightmares. But advances in technology are

running far ahead of efforts to limit their use. Any further privacy protection

will have to be legislated. "Whenever privacy questions occur in the context of

new technology, it takes a long time for the courts to respond," says Gilbert

S. Merritt, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,

who wrote the appellate opinion upholding the EPA's aerial surveillance of the

Dow Chemical plant. "The last issues arose with wiretapping. It's taken forty

years to reach some kind of stability in that law."<p>

<pre>

</pre>

<font size=5>M</font>OST new information, of course, will not raise privacy questions. But on what

terms will it be shared? Until now geographic data have been treated as a

national resource. Only a few governments have been capable of launching

earth-observing satellites. The last generation of U.S. civilian satellites,

the Landsat series, was financed by taxpayers, and most of its images are

available to the public for the cost of duplicating the information. (Landsat

images have been distributed commercially since 1985.) But the next group of

earth-observing satellites is being financed and launched by private companies.

Their images will be produced under contract, customized for clients, and made

available at market prices. EarthWatch will retain the ownership of all its

images, licensing their use by individual customers and restricting their

reproduction, just as computer companies now limit the copying of software.

Foreign governments, large corporations, and other paying clients will get

exclusive rights to information they pay for--a big change. "Up to now, when we

have acquired mapping information by contract, it has been in the public

domain," says Gale TeSelle, who coordinates geographic data at the Department

of Agriculture. "We give it away or we sell it as inexpensively as possible."

TeSelle believes that by using such information to encourage farmers to fight

erosion, for example, or to use a minimum of chemicals against pests, the

government can "increase the conservation ethic."<p>



None of these concerns should slow the next steps in mapping the earth. It is

cause for celebration that we are entering a time of competitive,

unpredictable exploration just when description of the seven continents seemed

virtually complete. Amid budget pressures and privatization efforts, however,

there is real danger that simple and familiar protections will be compromised.

Whatever the public and commercial value of creating precise maps linking

physical characteristics of residences with other publicly available

information, the making of those maps should be limited by the traditional

notion that a person's home and surrounding areas are private. And commercial

satellite ventures should be limited by the idea that geographic information

remains a national resource, to be shared at minimal cost. Dangers lie not in

what satellite sensors can record but in how the political system allows that

information to be used. The clearer the protections now, the greater the likely

benefits later.

<font size=5>"A</font>T the present writing, what with throwing away stuff 
I haven't liked, I have about forty pages of shooting script," Preston 
Sturges wrote to an anxious Darryl F.  Zanuck in 1947.  "This need not 
alarm you as I spritz dialogue like Seltzer water once I know where I'm 
going."<p>

What that claim lacked in diffidence, it made up for in deadeye truth. 
<A HREF="http://www.msstate.edu/M/person-exact?Sturges,%20Preston">Preston Sturges</A>
 spritzed some of the best dialogue ever written for American movies. He
could be slangy: in <i>Easy Living</i> (1937), Ray Milland urges Jean Arthur to
steal food from a busted Automat window in snappy vernacular, saying, "Don't be
a sucker, sister. That beef pie is a wow." He could be high-toned: in
<i>Unfaithfully Yours</i>, Rex Harrison rages haughtily at a suspicious Rudy
Vallee, "You dare to inform me you had vulgar footpads in snap brim fedoras
sluicing after my beautiful wife?" (Harrison gets a comeuppance when it's
pointed out that what he meant was "flatfoots" and "sleuthing," not "footpads"
and "sluicing." And soon <i>he's</i> suspicious too.)<p>

But these are one-liners.  Sturges's real flair was for spiraling exchanges 
between two or more characters, which typically run too long to print here: 
cardsharp Barbara Stanwyck's ensnarement of naive heir Henry Fonda in 
<i>The Lady Eve</i>, for example, or the opening of <A 
HREF="http://www.panix.com/~bfrazer/flicker/sullivan.html"><i>Sullivan's 
Travels</i>,</A> in which movie director Joel McCrea confounds his studio 
bosses with the bombshell that he's through making comedies and wants to 
get serious.  Nothing quite like these verbal volleys has been heard before 
or since.<p>

During his wonder years, from 1940 to 1944, Sturges applied his gift for
dialogue--along with his skills as a director and a producer--to the flagging
genre of romantic comedy, which he almost singlehandedly sustained with
<i>Christmas in July</i>, <i>The Lady Eve</i>, <i>Sullivan's Travels</i>,
<i>The Palm Beach Story</i>, <i>The Miracle of Morgan's Creek</i>, and <i>Hail
the Conquering Hero</i>. (In the midst of these came <i>The Great Moment</i>, a
structurally innovative biopic about the man who introduced ether as a surgical
anesthetic.) Together with <i>Unfaithfully Yours</i> (1948), they constitute an
unrivaled burst of Hollywood creativity--movies that are caustic, boisterous,
tumultuous, naughty, witty, and laced with surprising tomfoolery by actors who
had rarely excelled in film comedy before (Fonda, Stanwyck, McCrea, Harrison,
Vallee, and Mary Astor), not to mention crack supporting work by a stable of
character players. On the strength of this period Sturges belongs with the
great writer-directors, the true auteurs: the likes of Chaplin, Keaton, and
Bergman.<p>

What distinguishes him from the others, though, is the unlikely path he took to
become a director. He started out as a Hollywood screenwriter. The industry has
long since grown accustomed to writers-turned-directors: John Huston, Billy
Wilder, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Lawrence Kasdan, and Nora Ephron, to name just a
few. But before Sturges one has to go back to the silent era to find any. In
the interim the studio system had pigeonholed employees, expecting them to stay
in their places and be fruitful. Not only did Sturges trade his typewriter for
a megaphone but he helped Wilder, a Paramount colleague, make the same
switch.<p>

Sturges had come to Hollywood from Broadway early in the talkie era, and spent
most of the 1930s supplying scripts to contract directors. Among the movies
made from these are three comedies that can hold their own with the later,
all-Sturges works--<i>The Good Fairy</i>, <i>Easy Living</i>, and <i>Remember
the Night</i>--and a drama, <i>The Power and the Glory</i>, whose
flashback-driven narration was a prototype for Orson Welles's <i>Citizen
Kane</i>. Though lavishly paid (at his peak he was earning $3,250 a week),
Sturges chafed when the studios doctored and cut his scripts. He kept running
up against the kind of maddening circularity that squelches talented aspirants
everywhere: despite his brilliance and knowledge of the medium, nobody would
let him direct because nobody <i>else</i> had let him direct.<p>

In 1939 Paramount finally gave him a try, with his script for <i>The Great
McGinty</i>, the story of a onetime vagrant who gets elected governor of his
state. The early rushes looked so promising that when Sturges came down with
pneumonia, the studio refrained from handing the project to another director
and waited for him to get well. The film was a hit, and Sturges won an Oscar
for its screenplay. He found he didn't merely like directing; he "reveled" in
it. With a trunkful of draft scripts and embryonic ideas to draw upon, he was
off on his five-year roll.<p>

When the University of California Press brought out <i>Five Screenplays by
Preston Sturges</i>, in 1985, it was redressing neglect and trying to endow
posterity. To see a Sturges movie at the time, one almost had to live in a city
with an "art-house cinema," and even then, of course, one was dependent on its
programmer's whims. Film preservation was underfunded. Against the possibility
of losing Sturges films to obscurity and decay, prudence called for at least
disseminating their scripts.<p>

The intervening decade has witnessed a Sturges revival, with film-society
retrospectives of his work and the publication of a critical biography by Diane
Jacobs <A HREF="http://press-gopher.uchicago.edu:70/CGI/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/1200/92019690.ctl">(<i>Christmas in July: The Life and Art of Preston Sturges</i>).</A> The
case for Sturges has also been made in stylish books by James Harvey
(<i>Romantic Comedy in Hollywood From Lubitsch to Sturges</i>) and Elizabeth
Kendall (<i>The Runaway Bride: Hollywood Romantic Comedy of the 1930s</i>).
Repertory cinemas have all but vanished, but most of the movies Sturges wrote
and directed are now available on video. The cable channel American Movie
Classics regularly broadcasts the vintage output of Paramount and Twentieth
Century-Fox, with the result that televised showings of Sturges films have
become commonplace.<p>

Meanwhile, that first book of screenplays has gone into a second hardcover
printing and a paperback edition. If the new volume, <i>Four More Screenplays
by Preston Sturges</i>, is arriving with less urgency, it is still welcome--a
bonanza for scholars and a kickshaw for buffs.<p>

<font size=5>S</font>OME critics and biographers of Sturges depict him as caught between the
artistic leanings nurtured by his self-indulgent mother and an urge toward
success inspired by his bourgeois adoptive father. It's true that he was
familiar with both ways of life: almost from his birth, in 1898, he had a
divided childhood. His mother, n&eacute;e Mary Dempsey, changed her name to
Mary Desti in the interests of bon ton, fled with little Preston to Europe for
as much of each year as she could manage, and cultivated artistes. She became
best friends with the bohemian dancer Isadora Duncan, in whose  death Desti
played an unwitting part. She had given Duncan the red shawl that the dancer
was wearing as she settled into a sports car in 1927. While Desti looked on
helplessly, fringe on the shawl got caught in a wheel as the car began to move;
the yank broke Duncan's neck.<p>

If Edith Wharton had written farce, she might have created a heroine like
Desti, who had her share of triumphs; she started an intermittently successful
cosmetics business and married money several times, in more than one currency.
But she embroidered her life with fantasies. "She was . . . endowed with such a
rich and powerful imagination," Sturges wrote, "that anything she had said
three times, she believed fervently. Often twice was enough." In a fog of truth
and bluff mixed together, she steered her son through Continental art galleries
and concert halls and dragged him to toga parties in posh resorts. As a boy, he
met Enrico Caruso, Cosima Wagner, Lillian Russell, Theda Bara, and Aleister
Crowley.<p>

Periodically he went home and lived with his beloved adoptive father, Solomon
Sturges, a stockbroker in Chicago; the stable environment exerted a strong
appeal. The elder Sturges bankrolled his wife's sojourns until their increasing
length made it clear that the marriage was a sham. Solomon and Preston remained
close all their lives, whereas Preston's biological father, a man named Edmund
Biden, came calling only after his son was rich and famous. <p>

The young man's schooling was irregular and stopped short of college. He
dabbled in inventing and songwriting and ran his mother's company from New York
for several years, until she came back and claimed it. His first wife walked
out on him, ending their marriage. After appendicitis nearly killed him at age
thirty, he looked in the mirror and saw a failure in the making.<p>

Shortly afterward a hostile girlfriend helped him to discover his
m&eacute;tier. When she announced that she was writing a play to expose him as
a swaggering oaf, he vowed he would write a better one. "And what's more," he
told her, "my play will be produced first and will run longer." He won his bet,
though the play didn't run all that long. But his second effort, <i>Strictly
Dishonorable</i>, stayed on Broadway for more than a year. When subsequent
plays flopped, he moved to Hollywood, a seller's market for bright dialogue.
There he quickly mastered the rest of the screenwriter's craft, including a
sense of pacing that allowed his plots to make giddy turns without leaving the
audience behind.<p>

<font size=5>J</font>AMES Agee, in a favorable review of <i>Hail the Conquering Hero</i>, was among
those who diagnosed a divided psyche in Sturges, asserting that it was
reflected in his work. The "mastering object" of Sturges's comedies, Agee
wrote, was to

<BLOCKQUOTE>

sail as steep into the wind as possible without for an instant incurring the
disaster of becoming seriously, wholly acceptable as art. They seem to me,
indeed, in much of their twisting, the elaborately counterpointed image of a
neurosis. It is an especially interesting neurosis . . . the definitive
expression of this country at present--the stranglehold wedlock of the American
female tradition of "culture," the male tradition of "success."

</BLOCKQUOTE>

Brian Henderson, the film professor who has edited both volumes of screenplays,
takes issue with this---and rightly so. Like many other Americans during the
Depression, Sturges was fascinated by somersaults of fortune, which figure in
several of his plots: in <i>Easy Living</i>, <i>The Great McGinty</i>,
<i>Christmas in July</i>, <i>The Palm Beach Story</i>, and <i>Hail the
Conquering Hero</i>. He rubbed shoulders with tycoons and was especially good
at caricaturing the vacuous American millionaire-by-inheritance. But his was
not the career of a trimmer. He "persisted with <i>The Great Moment</i>,"
Henderson writes, "even though it cost him the enmity of his studio [Paramount]
and finally undid him, simply because he believed in the project."<p>

In <i>Sullivan's Travels</i>, which confronts the tension between art and
commerce, the eponymous director-hero, who hankers after social significance
&agrave; la Frank Capra, is an object of Horatian satire. In the end Sullivan
decides to stick with what he does best, even if it happens to be gratifyingly
lucrative, after an audience of convicts watching a Disney cartoon reminds him
of the value of laughter. Obviously the film pleads for Sturges's own
inclinations. But it's hard to square this good-natured work with the notion
that its creator shrank neurotically from gravitas.<p>

What <i>is </i>bothersome about his movies is that too often--pressed for time
and with an eye on the groundlings--Sturges suspended the verbal fun in favor
of formulaic slapstick. His masterpiece, <i>The Lady Eve</i>, is blemished by
all the trippings, beanings, and food-spatterings inflicted on Henry Fonda.
Sturges moaned when the Paramount bosses wrested <i>The Great Moment</i> away
from him and "cut [it] for comedy." But he had played into their hands by
larding the story with a rampage in a bottle shop, a plunge through a glass
window, and multiple pratfalls.<p>

The intricate version of that film which Sturges approved is lost, but the
simplified studio release is out on video. The script's inclusion in <i>Four
More Screenplays</i> allows readers to visualize what Sturges had in mind and
then rent the video and see what a hash Paramount made of it. But comparing
other scripts with their filmed incarnations reveals movement toward
perfection. In <i>The Lady Eve</i>, for example, Stanwyck's anticipation of her
revenge on Fonda improves from "I need him like Dempsey needed Firpo" on the
page to "I need him like the axe needs the turkey" on the screen.<p>

There is also the pleasure of watching written instructions spring to life.
Again in <i>The Lady Eve</i>, just after Stanwyck and Fonda marry, she exacts
her revenge by making up and flaunting a promiscuous past. She ran off with her
first husband at sixteen, she claims. This was Angus, "a groom on Father's
estate." Fonda's reaction line is "A groom!"--which Sturges wanted him to say
"as if he had swallowed vitriol." To hear Fonda croak the word "groom" is to
witness a lovely coupling of intention with execution.<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE culture Sturges was force-fed as a boy came to fruition in <i>Unfaithfully
Yours</i>, a Juvenalian satire about a maestro (Harrison) whose fantasies of
dealing with his allegedly unfaithful wife (Linda Darnell) jibe with the
various musical war-horses he conducts. The movie flopped, in part because of a
ghastly coincidence. In the dominant fantasy sequence Harrison murders Darnell.
Before the film opened, Harrison's real-life girlfriend, the actress Carole
Landis, killed herself. Twentieth Century-Fox lost confidence in
<i>Unfaithfully Yours</i>; the reviews were mixed; and it failed to find an
audience.<p>

Between Paramount and Fox, Sturges had gone into partnership with Howard
Hughes--a disaster that produced only one movie, the so-so <i>Sin of Harold
Diddlebock</i>. According to Henderson, <i>Diddlebock</i> is still tied up in
Hughes's estate and thus is unavailable for reprinting.<p>

Beginning in 1940 Sturges squandered much of his energy on The Players, a
restaurant he designed, managed, and poured a fortune into. He seemed to need
this white elephant as a status symbol, as if the Oscar and the kudos and the
buckets of money weren't enough. He made another film for Fox, a Betty Grable
vehicle called <i>The Beautiful Blonde From Bashful Bend</i>. Its god-awfulness
ended his American career. Abroad, he directed one last time--<i>The French
They Are a Funny Race</i>, in dual French and English versions. It, too, was a
clinker. By now he was drinking hard and almost broke; friends noticed him
pocketing rolls from his lunch tray for the next morning's breakfast. In one of
the last photographs taken of him, he looks a decade older than his sixty
years.<p>

Sturges died of a heart attack in 1959, while working on his autobiography in a
New York hotel room. He was survived by his fourth wife and their two young
sons, and a son from his third marriage. Money had gotten so scarce that he
hadn't been able to join his new family in California since their return from
Europe a year and a half ahead of him. But there's no need to dwell on his grim
end. Preserved on videocassette and in these two books of screenplays, the
Sturges legacy is secure.

AN the wishes of two Presidents, Republican and Democratic, of most
governors, of several Congresses, and of up to 80 percent of  the American
public and teachers simply be ignored? So it seems. Over the past five 
years
all of them have called for national academic standards, to make schools
stronger and more equal. But their will has been frustrated by the 
century-old
habits of American educators unable to conceive of excellence and equity
co-existing in the schools most children have to attend. This makes a
depressing story, but some of it needs telling if those children are to 
see a
happy ending. For to succeed where national efforts failed, state and local
school leaders, teachers, parents, and citizens need to understand what 
they
are up against, what has to be done differently, and how much is at 
stake.</font>  <p>

	</A>
They can begin by recognizing, and tolerating no longer, the vast inertia 
of an
educational establishment entrenched in many university faculties of 
education;
in well-heeled interest associations, with their bureaucracies, journals, 
and
conventions; in hundreds of research centers and consulting firms; in 
federal,
state, and local bureaucracies; in textbook-publishing houses and the
aggressive new industries of educational technology and assessment. On the
whole this establishment is well-meaning, and it is not monolithic, all of 
one
mind. But its mainstream, trained and engrossed in the means rather than 
the
academic content of education, instinctively resists any reform that starts
with content and then lets it shape everything else--most certainly the 
means.
<p>

Starting school reform by first deciding what every child should learn 
strikes
most people as only common sense. But to many American educators, it spells
revolutionary change. The standards strategy for school reform would give
subject-matter teachers and scholars, and the educated public, 
unprecedented
power to spur genuine change--change far deeper than questions of school
choice, methods, or management. Means and management are not the problem. 
The
overused business analogy breaks down: business first decides the content 
of
its product; means follow. But educators, unwilling to focus on subject 
matter,
have never decided what content everyone should know; the curriculum stays
frozen, incoherent and unequal. For more than a decade American citizens 
have
wanted high, common standards--the only new idea for their schools in a
century. But to get them, they will have to work around the establishment, 
and
overturn the status quo.<p>

			<img src="./cliff.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="">


The first step toward change was taken in 1983, when the National 
Commission on
Excellence in Education delivered a ringing wake-up call: "If an unfriendly
foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational
performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of 
war."
The commission's report, <a href="http://www.ed.gov/pubs/NatAtRisk/"><i>A 
Nation at Risk</i></a>, told us that other countries'
schools were doing better in both quality and equality of learning--and 
ours
were losing ground on each count. In the commission's words, "a rising 
tide of
mediocrity" belied our democratic promise that "all, regardless of race or
class or economic status, are entitled to a fair chance and to the tools 
for
developing their individual powers of mind and spirit to the utmost."<p>

<i>A Nation at Risk</i> gave rise to the standards strategy for school
improvement, talk or the avoidance of which has preoccupied American 
educators
ever since. It said that all high school students, regardless of 
background or
vocational prospects, needed a common core curriculum of four years of 
English,
three years each of mathematics, science, and social studies, and a 
semester of
computer science. The college-bound should add two years of foreign 
language.
In the early 1980s only 13.4 percent of our high school graduates had 
taken the
first four of those "new basics." Adding the computer semester dropped the
percentage all the way to 2.7, and adding foreign language made it 1.9.
"Mediocrity" was a mild word for what was going on. But the public paid
attention: many states and districts raised their core academic 
requirements,
over the objections of experts who declared that dropout rates would soar, 
for
minorities most of all.<p>

By 1990, the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/pubs/stats.html
">National Center for Education Statistics</a> found, 39.8 percent of
high school graduates had taken the recommended years of English, 
mathematics,
science, and social studies; 22.7 percent added the computer semester; 17.3
percent added both computers and the foreign language. Instead of rising, 
the
dropout rate for African-Americans declined, and for Hispanics remained 
roughly
stable. The percentage of African-American students taking the required 
years
of academic subjects rose from 10.1 to 41.1; for Hispanics it rose from 
6.3 to
32.7. "Top-down" recommendations, with state and local implementation, had 
made
a difference, and they continue, albeit at a slower rate, to do so. <p>

The glass, however, is still at best half full. And by comparison with the
democratization of public schools in other countries, it is well under half
empty. Our 25 percent dropout rate means that the roughly 40 percent of 
high
school graduates in 1990 who got the recommended classes made up only 30
percent of all young people of that age. In 1991, in two school systems at
opposite ends of the earth, about two thirds of the corresponding Japanese 
and
French age groups completed markedly more-demanding academic programs, 
which
included foreign languages. In both countries about half the students were 
in
programs combining technical and liberal education. Even disregarding 
foreign
languages, relatively few of our young people graduate from academic 
programs
that are as rigorous as those abroad. For fully equivalent programs, a 
generous
estimate of American completion would be 15 percent--about a quarter of the
French and Japanese completion rate.<p>

We used to say--and too many educators still say--that we cannot compare 
our
schools with those of other countries, because they educate only an elite 
and
we try to educate everybody. Untrue for thirty years, this is now the 
opposite
of the truth. They educate the many, and we the few. To our shame, a
disadvantaged child has a better chance for an equal and rigorous 
education,
and whatever advancement it may bring, in Paris or Copenhagen than in one 
of
our big cities.<p>

Comparing curricula makes us look bad enough, but what is behind the course
titles on student transcripts? Are American courses as substantial as those
abroad? To make them so, President George Bush and the nation's governors
launched a movement to set national standards for course content at 
meetings in
Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1989. <a 
href="http://www.ed.gov/pubs/goals/summary/goals.html">Goal Three of their 
statement</a> insisted that
course content be academically "challenging," comparable to that in the 
best
schools here and overseas, and--for equity--that all students be offered 
such
content and be expected to master it. Polls showed overwhelming public 
support,
even for a national curriculum. <p>

Shortly after, Congress set up a National Council on Education Standards 
and
Testing, to "advise on the desirability and feasibility of national 
standards
and tests." In its report of January, 1992, the council recommended both.
National content standards, it said, ought to "define what students should 
know
and be able to do" in English, geography, history, mathematics, and 
science,
"with other subjects to follow." A core of common content was needed to
"promote educational equity, to preserve democracy and enhance the civic
culture, and to improve economic competitiveness." It should set high
expectations, not minimal competencies; it should provide focus and 
direction,
not a national curriculum. <p>

The ball was handed off to the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">U.S. 
Department of Education</a>, which in turn
funded privately based consortia of scholars and teachers to decide what 
was
most worth learning in each major subject. The stage was set to open equal
opportunities for learning, to temper the curricular chaos of 15,000 school
districts, so that children would no longer be entirely at the mercy of 
where
or to whom they were born. Some of us in the Department of Education were 
sure
it could be done. We were wrong. The department itself never decided how 
the
standards strategy ought to work, or how to explain it to others. Last year
four of the national projects it had commissioned--in the arts, civics,
geography, and history--issued their documents. (Science and 
foreign-language
projects are still under way. A math project had been separately completed 
in
1991.) After spending more than $900,000, the English project had been 
defunded
for nonperformance, its professional associations unable to do for our 
language
and literature what other nations have done for theirs. (One subcommittee
solemnly voted that the phrase "standard English" be replaced by 
"privileged
dialect.") Only the civics document earned countrywide respect. The others 
met
with disbelief and complaint over their length and extravagant demands. The
American-history standards set off an ideological conflict that is still
boiling, an issue for presidential candidates at campaign stops. (For an
examination of the disappointing standards for world history, see page 
74.)<p>

A year after the standards projects reported, the national version of
standards-based reform is dead of multiple wounds, some self-inflicted, 
others
from our culture wars, still others from congressional antipathy to any 
federal
initiative, and most from American educators who have long resisted
establishing a common core of academic learning. Recovery now depends on 
the
states' choosing their own standards. But where a well-funded nationwide 
effort
collapsed, how can states step in and do it right? Are we as a people 
ready to
apply the standards of our very best schools, public and private, to all 
the
others, and reform a system that is generally mediocre and shamefully 
unequal? A
century of avoidance says no. <p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC1">THE
TEN 
</a>
<a name="RTFToC2">AND
THE NINE
</a></h3>
<font size=5>T</font>HE idea that democratic education requires a 
rigorously academic core for
every student is not new. The report of the illustrious Committee of Ten,
published in 1894, forcefully articulated it, calling for an established
academic curriculum for all high school students, <i>whether or not they 
were
going to college</i>. Italics are needed, for the committee was falsely 
accused
in its time of caring only for the college-bound, and thus of being 
elitist and
anti-democratic. This line is still taken by educators who have not read 
the
report.<p>

The story of the Ten's defeat and the triumph of progressive education's
dumbed-down version of John Dewey's ideas, which reads eerily like the 
failure
of the national-standards movement today, is best told in Richard 
Hofstadter's
<i>Anti-Intellectualism in American Life,</i> which won the Pulitzer Prize 
in
1964. Chaired by Charles William Eliot, the president of Harvard, the 
Committee
of Ten was made up of six university scholars (several had taught in 
secondary
schools), three high school principals, including the head of the Girls' 
High
School in Boston, and William T. Harris, the U.S. Commissioner of 
Education.
The common core they advocated required four years of foreign language and
English language and literature, three to four years of math and science, 
and
two to four years of history. Young Americans taking on the profession of
citizen, they said, needed a demanding curriculum, not the "feeble and 
scrappy"
courses offered in too many high schools. This was doubly important for 
"school
children who have no expectation of going to college," so that they might 
have
at maturity "a salutary influence" upon the affairs of the country.<p>

The report could have been written today. It anticipated the progressive
pedagogical agenda and our latest "innovations" as well. It decried the 
"dry
and lifeless system of instruction by text-book." Facts alone were 
repellent;
schooling was for "the invaluable mental power which we call the 
judgment." It
deplored mere coverage. To reach a common core of essentials, less was 
more:
"select the paramount." The committee argued for active inquiry in original
sources, studies in depth, individual and group projects, seminars, 
debates and
re-enactments, field trips, museum work, mock legislatures and 
conventions. All
possible teaching aids should be used: engravings, photographs, maps, 
globes,
and the "magic lantern." To make time, school hours needed to be longer and
more flexible. <p>

For the new curriculum the Ten urged that history, civil government, and
geography be taught as one. They wanted history and English "intimately
connected," with constant cross-referencing to other countries and eras, to
literature and art. They wanted more time for foreign languages, starting 
in
the elementary grades. The continuing education of teachers needed more
rigor--courses during the school year, taught by university scholars, for
teachers who needed "the spirit or the apparatus to carry their classes 
outside
. . . [the] narrow limits" of textbooks. Educators today reinvent these
century-old ideas and declare them "exciting," as though nobody 
before--least
of all academicians--could have thought such things.<p>

The Ten's marriage of common substance and varied methods--exactly the 
object
of today's standards strategy--was broken by the advent of a new corps of
nonacademic educators who argued that common requirements would force a
multitude of students to drop out. In 1911 a Committee of Nine on the
Articulation of High School and College turned the Ten on their heads. The
Nine, primarily public school administrators, insisted that school "holding
power" depended on meeting interests that "each boy and girl has at the 
time."
To focus on academics was to enslave the high school to the college, and 
lead
students away from "pursuits for which they are adapted" toward those "for
which they are not adapted and in which they are not needed." Schools 
should
focus on industrial arts, agriculture, and "household science." <p>

The influence of what Hofstadter called an "anti-intellectualist movement" 
also
stood out in <i>Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education</i>, issued in 
1918
by the National Education Association's Commission on the Reorganization of
Secondary Education, and nationally distributed by the U.S. Office of
Education. Again made up of administrators, the commission included no 
academic
subjects in its list of seven things high schools ought to teach: health,
command of fundamental processes (the three Rs), "worthy" home membership,
"worthy" use of leisure, vocation, citizenship, and ethical character. This
report, too, could have been written today, by the promoters of 
content-free
brands of "outcomes-based education," which they celebrate as new and
"transformational."<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC3">MASS
TRIAGE
</a></h3>
<font size=5>F</font>ROM the 1920s on, vast numbers of children were 
locked into curricular tracks
and "ability groups" on the basis of surface differences--race, ethnicity,
language, social class, sex, "deportment," and intelligence as categorized 
by
inane notions of testing--that had nothing to do with their potential. At 
the
low point of this mass triage, leaders of the "Life Adjustment" movement 
of the
1940s consigned up to 80 percent of all American children and adolescents 
to
the nonacademic heap. Hofstadter called it the most anti-democratic moment 
in
the history of schooling. In the next decade James Bryant Conant's 
influential
book <i>The American High School Today</i> (1959) still sought no common
academic core and considered no more than 20 percent of students as
"academically talented." The rest, Conant said, should "follow vocational 
goals
and . . . develop general interests." And in <i>The Education of American
Teachers</i> (1963), Conant added that at the university level "a 
prescription
of general education is impossible unless one knows, at least 
approximately,
the vocational aspirations of the group in question."<p>

Thus spoke mainstream American educators, habitually failing to recall the
three distinct purposes of schooling--for work, for public affairs, for 
private
culture--and ever unable to imagine what free people could be as citizens 
or
private personalities outside their daily work. From the report of the 
Nine to
the present, educators (including those at many universities) have put
socializing the masses and job training ahead of intellect. At different 
times
socializing takes on various looks from group to group, left to right. But 
its
common root is distrust of ordinary people's minds and spirit. Unable to 
think
and seek the good, ordinary people must be socially engineered to amuse
themselves and to behave. We boast of escaping the old world's class 
system,
but cherish our own brand of social privilege. Academic standards, 
educators
have said for a century, are not for everyone--as though most people do not
deserve or need a liberal education, as though we want them not as equals 
but
only to work and to buy, Beta-minuses out of Aldous Huxley's <i>Brave New
World</i>. To feel better, we tell one another the story that schools can 
be
"different but equal," a swindle still outliving its twin, "separate but
equal." <p>

In contrast, the cataclysms of depression and war brought educators in 
Europe
to other views by the 1950s: it was time to democratize their schools, by
leveling upward. As European secondary schools were opened to all, the
political parties of the left resolved that the children of workers and the
poor should gain whatever personal and political power they could from the 
same
academic curriculum formerly reserved to the few.<p>

A generation earlier America had leveled downward, accepting a dual, 
unequal
school system sold to trusting citizens with warm words of solicitude by
expert-specialists. In fact those specialists were perpetuating elitism by
denouncing liberal education as elitist. Europeans were not so trusting as 
we,
either of experts or of one another. Out of revolution and class conflict 
they
had raised wariness to a high art, looking behind words for consequences. 
In
Europe the schools had been battlegrounds for ideas about human nature,
religion, history, national honor, and democracy itself. European 
democrats who
had suffered Nazi occupation were not about to accept the notion that 
schools
could be different but equal.<p>

Had we looked overseas after midcentury, we could have learned from both 
our
allies and our enemies in the Second World War. But we did not and still do
not. Those most reluctant to look abroad are the promoters of giddy 
educational
fixes that no foreign country would take seriously, from subjecting 
schools to
the "free market" all the way to killing off academic disciplines in favor 
of
"issue-based inquiry." Albert Shanker, the president of the American 
Federation
of Teachers, puts it squarely, as usual: Americans tolerate a "marked
inequality of opportunity in comparison with Germany, France, or Japan." 
Why do
students work harder in those countries, with the same TV and pop culture 
to
distract them? Because their educators have decided what all students 
should
know by the end of high school, Shanker says, and they have "worked back 
from
these goals to figure out what children should learn by the time they are 
ages
fourteen and nine." Standards are universal and known by everyone, so 
"fewer
students are lost--and fewer teachers are lost."<p>

<h3>CONTENT-BASED 

<a name="RTFToC4">REFORM</a></h3><p>
 <font size=5>G</font>RANTED, the U.S. Department of Education's own 
ambivalence did not help the
standards strategy's reception. What could easily have been explained as a
necessarily slow four-step process--in which most important decisions 
would be
left to states, local districts, schools, and teachers--remained in 
confusion.
And when expensive standards projects refused to discipline themselves and
lugged forth great tomes that looked like national curricula, the 
department
gave up trying. It let go the idea of a national core of essential 
learning and
decided to say that setting standards was now up to the states. <p>

Having fifty sets of standards need not mean disaster. But the Committee 
of Ten
was right: something close to national agreement on a vital common core is
indispensable to educational equity, to dislodge and replace the empty,
undemanding programs that leave so many children untaught and 
disadvantaged.
Without some such agreement, the much-heralded devolution of reform 
leadership
to the states could make things worse. <p>

The four steps essential to content-based school reform are no mystery. But
conventional educators will object to them, for they focus on subject 
matter
and must be carried out by subject-matter teachers and scholars, not by
curriculum specialists unlearned in academic disciplines. In step one, 
teachers
and scholars work together under public review to write the content
standards--brief, scrupulously selected lists of what is most worth 
knowing in
each academic subject. These have but one function: to lay before students,
parents, teachers, and the university teachers of teachers the essential 
core
of learning that all students in a modern democracy have the right not to 
be
allowed to avoid. "Core" means what it says: teaching it should take no 
more
than two thirds of the time given to each subject, the rest being left to 
local
school and teacher choice. <p>

This step is the most critical but most often misunderstood. What is a
subject-matter essential, or "standard," and what is not? It is specific, 
not
abstract, but it does not descend to detail. In history a typical standard 
asks
students to understand the causes of the First World War, with an eye to 
the
technological, economic, social, and political forces at work, together 
with
the roles of individuals, of accident, and of ordinary confusion. It does 
not
ask students to "master the concept of conflict in world history." Nor 
does it
ask them to memorize the names of the twenty central characters in the 
tragedy
of the summer of 1914. <p>

As they select each standard, scholars and teachers must consider whether 
they
can explain its importance when students ask "So what?" The First World 
War is
an easy example. What it did to Americans was to shape their lives and 
deaths
for the rest of the twentieth century--from the Depression and the Second 
World
War to the end of the Cold War, from our hubris of 1945 to our present 
fantasy
that we have spent ourselves too poor even to keep our parks clean or our
libraries open. If a standard cannot be explained to the young, or to an
educated public, it is either too general or too detailed. In a hurry, some
states have issued "common cores of learning" that are lists of healthy
attitudes and abstract "learning outcomes." Others have copied detail 
directly
out of the overstuffed national standards documents. Neither is a help to
teachers or curriculum makers.<p>

Step two was never "national" business: writing a state curriculum 
framework,
saying in which grades the essentials should be taught. Its function is to 
end
the plague of gaps and repetitions that only American educators seem 
resigned
to accept as normal. Articulating subject matter across the elementary and
secondary years also requires a collaboration of equals--teachers, 
scholars,
and learning specialists--each of whom has things to say that the others 
need
to hear. The word "framework," too, means what it says; it leaves the third
step--course design and pedagogy --to the school and the teacher. They must
have the authority to make the choices most important to them and to their
students: the topics and questions by which to teach the essentials, the
day-to-day content of instruction, the materials and methods best suited to
their students and to their own strengths.<p>

Step four, writing performance standards and tests of achievement, can 
sensibly
follow only when the others have been taken. But some states are hurrying 
to
award expensive contracts to outside testing firms before anyone has 
thought
about, much less decided, what is worth testing. To leave this to experts 
and
let the rush to "accountability"--which now has a potent assessment lobby
behind it--drive standards and course content will kill all chances for 
school
improvement. Not everything precious can be measured, and not everything
measurable is worth teaching; pap is pap, a drop or a gallon. So once more 
it
is teachers and scholars who must decide what to assess. <p>

Content-based reform will not always be easy even for teachers and 
scholars.
All who teach, from the grades to graduate school, will have to be 
differently
educated than they now are and teach differently than they now teach. For
example, the history learned at any level depends on the prior education of
both student and teacher. And the decision about what history to teach must
anticipate what is to be learned at higher levels. But this is not how 
American
schools and universities work. Teachers and academicians habitually shape 
each
course as an island entire to itself, as though what they teach, or do not
teach, matters to nobody but themselves --as if others had no right to 
notice,
and none to intervene. That must change.<p>

Schoolteachers and university scholars will have to accept each other as
equals, because aligning subject matter demands seamless, collaborative 
work
from pre-school through Ph.D. They rarely do so now. Nor do elementary and 
high
school teachers confer, or teachers in the same building. Apart from ego,
insecurity, and worries over turf, collaboration takes time, which schools 
and
universities rarely provide, and personal commitment, which they rarely 
reward.
Moreover, to choose essentials and to design frameworks and assessments,
educators will have to debate priorities. What <i>is</i> truly most worth
knowing? What must be left out? Academicians avoid such questions at all 
cost;
witness their chaotic college curricula. University faculties will have to
alter their major programs, giving up pet courses for others that better
prepare the next generation of teachers and help those already teaching. 
They
will have to battle colleagues into coherent general-education 
requirements for
underclassmen. To do all this, academicians will need to be broadly 
educated,
and be differently rewarded by administrative and trustee policies.<p>

States whose educators accept this degree of change will accomplish
standards-based reform. Where change is rejected, they will fail. The hard 
fact
is that anchoring school reform in academic learning--and putting teachers 
and
scholars in charge--is foreign in all senses. It would redirect the 
mainstream
of American education as the twentieth-century parade of much-hyped 
fashions
never has. Life Adjustment, "greening," the open classroom, "back to 
basics,"
career education, "futures learning," global consciousness, 
"doing-a-value,"
critical and creative thinking, and "outcomes-based" education (are there 
other
kinds?)--not one of these has ruffled the establishment or gotten beneath 
the
surface to substantial subject matter, and so not one has improved the 
schools
of most American children. Indeed, by leaving weary teachers awash in the
debris from successive tides of obsession and indifference, they have made
things worse.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC5">OBSTACLES
AND 
</a>
<a name="RTFToC6">PROSPECTS</a></h3><p>
<font size=5>O</font>F the obstacles reformers confront, the toughest may 
be our mad
utilitarianism. Consider the three aims of schooling--preparing the 
worker, the
citizen, and the cultivated individual. We put the worker ahead of the 
other
two, as if they had no effect on the nation's economy or the quality of 
work
done. Turning to citizenship, we bypass the substance of history, politics,
letters, and ideas and peddle ready-made attitudes. Thus American educators
have never had to think consistently about the moral, aesthetic, or
intellectual content of public schooling for the masses--the gifts that
academic subjects open for everyone.<p>

Since academics have been for the few, it follows that our teacher corps is
academically undereducated, ill prepared to offer challenging content to 
all
its charges. Teachers are not to blame. Since so little is expected from 
most
students, the university teachers of teachers--whether in content or
pedagogy--see no reason to ask much of <i>them</i>. The time it will take 
to
re-prepare teachers is itself an obstacle. There are no shortcuts to
content-based reform, which makes it vulnerable to hawkers of new fashions 
from
an education industry whose planned obsolescence leaves <i>haute couture 
</i>in
the dust.<p>

States will discover that the changes required by academic school reform 
will
call down showers of objection. "Standards alone will not solve our
problems"--as if anyone thought they could. "Standards will oppress 
minorities
and the poor"--as if the absence of standards does not leave educators 
free to
offer unequal schooling and tax cutters free to slash school spending.
"Standards will stifle innovation"--as though clear and equal standards 
were
not the best friends of innovators. Parents have seen far too many passing 
fads
that skew or empty the curriculum. Settled aims will make it easier to
experiment with school structure, school size, and all the ways that 
schools
have to be different from one another to meet different circumstances.<p>

States will find friends in teachers and citizens who, not overspecialized,
have no ideology to press, and who understand that the three purposes of
education--for work, for citizenship, and for private life--are by their 
nature
distinct, many-sided, requiring different, sometimes opposite, modes of
teaching aimed at different, sometimes opposite, results. Schooling for 
work is
a "conservative" function, demanding disciplined mastery of tasks from the
world of work as it is, not as we wish it to be, and objective testing of
student competence. Schooling for citizenship, in contrast, is a "radical"
activity, egalitarian and skeptical in style, mixing the hard study of 
history
and ideas with free-swinging exchange on public issues. The school nurtures
both teamwork and thorny individualism, at once the readiness to serve and 
the
readiness to resist, for nobody knows ahead of time which the good citizen 
may
have to do. To educate the private person, the school must detach itself 
much
of the time from the clamor of popular culture. It must be conservative in
requiring students to confront the range of arts, letters, and right 
behavior
conceived in the past, toward the liberal end that their choices be 
informed
and thereby free. <p>

People well know that to work at these three purposes, schools must serve 
both
society and the individual, must be close to daily life at some moments and
wholly insulated at others. They know that different things are learned 
best in
different ways, from drill to brainstorming, and that schools have to be
<i>both </i>disciplined and easygoing, hierarchical and egalitarian, at
different times for different subjects at different levels--mixing 
pleasure and
pain, each often following upon the other. <p>

In sum, they can understand why Theodore Sizer is not indulging in paradox 
when
he says that only "a loose system that has rigor" can correct what he 
describes
in <i>Horace's School </i>(1992)as "the inattention of American culture to
serious learning." We need, he says, "generous localism" applied with high 
and
common academic expectations. For a century we have resisted this, 
treating the
majority of our children as though they were learning-disabled. We say that
knowledge is power, but we have kept knowledge from millions of children,
adolescents, and even college students. Our chance to make this 
long-delayed
turn to democratic education is now in the hands of the states and local
schools.

<center><h1> 
Botched 
Standards</h1><p>



<i>Which is more important for young people to study--Magna Carta or the
Mongol empire? The latest answer may surprise you</i><p></center>


<font size=5>T</font>HE world-history document issued by the <a 
href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/nchs/
">National Center for History in the Schools</a>, at UCLA, and funded by 
the U.S. Department of Education and the
National Endowment for the Humanities, is worth a close look, as a 
cautionary
tale for reformers who may assume that scholars see the role of standards 
more
clearly than others do. Given its 314 pages, and the limited time schools 
allot
to world history, it is not helpful even for picking and choosing, because 
it
has no continuing questions to help readers focus on essentials, as better
textbooks do. To avoid the battles among specialists that selection would 
have
set off, its authors, careful to offend no vocal constituency, acted on the
dubious principle that all societies and all eras back to prehistory 
deserve
equal space in the education of young Americans. By so doing they buried
essentials under mounds of undifferentiated matter, much of it academic 
exotica
and antiquarianism.<p>

The document's failure is surprising, because its opening pages are 
eloquent on
why citizens must study history. No reason, it argues, is "more important 
to a
democratic society than this: <i>Knowledge of history is the precondition 
of
political intelligence</i>." It adds, "Without history, a society shares no
common memory of where it has been, what its core values are, or what 
decisions
of the past account for present circumstances." Also in italics is Etienne
Gilson's remark <i>"History is the only laboratory we have in which to 
test the
consequences of thought."</i> But between the promise and the execution we 
find
a chasm. The volume is weakest on thought and the consequences of ideas, on
core values and common memories, not only the West's but any 
civilization's. It
is thin on political turning points and institutions, and thereby on the 
drama
of human choice and its effects. For all its length and pretentious 
demands, it
scants the artistic, literary, and philosophical legacies of world 
cultures,
and it shortchanges the past 250 years, which saw so many of the decisions 
that
"account for present circumstances." <p>

Its treatment of world history has thirty-nine main standards, 108 
subheads,
and 526 sub-subheads, all of them called standards. None of the main 
standards
or subheads is devoted to ideas, whether philosophical, religious, 
ethical, or
moral, social, economic, or political. One must descend to the 526
sub-subheads, or to fragments of them. Neither the Judaic nor the Christian
principles that are the sources of Western values, morals, and views of 
justice
and of ideas of the individual's dignity and responsibility--even for
unreligious or anti-religious thinkers--are given more than one half of a
sub-subhead, less than a thousandth of the document's substance. The ideas 
of
Islam and of Protestant reformers fare no better. However, the topic 
"mastery
of horse-riding on the steppes" gets twice that space, the Scythians and 
the
Xiongnu fill two full sub-subheads, and the Olmecs get a main standard all 
to
themselves. <p>

On the secular side, there is nothing of medieval thought about just rules 
of
law, war, economic life, or social responsibility. Later we find nothing of
Renaissance or Reformation theory concerning society, economics, or 
politics.
Enlightenment thought and its impact on Church and State are relegated to a
single sub-subhead. French revolutionary ideas "on social equality, 
democracy,
human rights, constitutionalism, and nationalism" get one sub-subhead out 
of
ninety-four for the years 1750-1914. For the twentieth century a single
sub-subhead asks students to explain the "leading ideas of liberalism, 
social
reformism, conservatism, and socialism as competing ideologies in 20th 
century
Europe." Leninist and Fascist-Nazi ideologies are each assigned half of a
sub-subhead, so that only two sub-subheads must do for the political ideas 
and
ideology of the entire twentieth-century world. <p>

In squeezing European civilization, the document is also meager on the
political history that makes sophisticated citizens. There is nothing on 
the
failure of Athenian democracy to overcome the forces of pride and 
demagoguery.
The vast questions about Rome's decline that so preoccupied the American
Founders are compressed into part of a subhead, less than half the space 
given
the Gupta empire in India. As to politics in the years 1000-1500, a single
sub-subhead is devoted to "analyzing how European monarchies expanded their
power at the expense of feudal lords and assessing the growth and 
limitations
of representative institutions in these monarchies." So, buried and 
unnamed in
half of that sub-subhead are Magna Carta and the Model Parliament, along 
with
the prime political lesson that true constitutions require a balance of 
power
in society. In the same era entire standards take up the Mongol empire and
sub-Saharan Africa. <p>

The seventeenth-century English Revolution gets a single sub-subhead (out 
of
eighty-four for the era 1450-1770)--no more than "evaluating the interplay 
of
indigenous Indian, Persian, and European influences in Mughal artistic,
architectural, literary, and scientific achievements." The authors find 
nothing
special about English constitutional history that American citizens should
know, in keeping with today's fashion of decrying "Whig history," as 
though the
worldwide struggle for political freedom, and all of its sacrifice, 
setbacks,
and advances, were only a myth to hoodwink the innocent young. All but 
absent,
too, is the history of labor. In the section covering the twentieth century
there is no mention of trade unions, their battles and importance to 
democracy
and social justice, and why totalitarians make them their first victims. 
Even
the vast twentieth-century struggle of liberal democracies to overcome 
Nazism
and Soviet communism fades into pale generalities. <p>

Some of the weaknesses in the world-history document are but the reverse 
side
of American virtues: hopefulness and generosity; our eagerness to embrace
diversity, to be self-critical, to shun "ethnocentrism." In what other 
country
do people cringe at that word and are students required to study other 
cultures
but not their own? The standards also reflect our impatience with 
politics, our
reluctance to admit that only politics can turn aspirations into reality, 
and
our impatience with the gloomier views of human nature that accept the 
presence
of evil in the world, and the tragedy and imperfection of the human 
condition.
<p>

The fact remains, however, that in deference to current styles in the 
history
profession, the authors played down the Western sources of their own 
American
consciences, and failed to do the work of selecting what would best serve 
the
education of American students, or of society at large. Fortunately, their
introduction makes clear why state and local teacher-scholar teams must do
better. Nothing less is at stake than our political competence as a 
people.<p>

Taking the solidity of democratic institutions for granted, educators have
worried too little about the hard things they require citizens to 
understand.
Now, in the mid-1990s, we have reasons to pay more attention. For one 
thing, it
takes a perverse effort of will to deny that the effects of technology and
economics, demography and nature, make our problems and the world's more
complicated than ever. Or to deny that nostrums peddled by the loudest 
voices
in politics and talk TV and radio are more simplistic than ever. Or that
blaming "government" for every ill and anxiety--while not yet so virulent 
as
under the Weimar Republic--betrays a flaming ignorance of history and human
nature. <p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC7">WHAT
HISTORY 
</a>
<a name="RTFToC8">TEACHES</a></h3><p>
<font size=5>W</font>ITH respect to world history, what should Americans 
know and teach? What
is the main story? It is not the parade of military, technological, and
economic "interactions," or the endless comparisons among often 
incomparable
centers of great power, that global studies dwell upon--although these 
must, of
course, be taken into account. The big story is not the push to modernize 
but
the struggle to civilize, to curb the bestial side of human nature. What
students can grasp very well is that this is a common struggle, in which 
all
peoples and races are equal--equal in our natures, equal in the historical
guilt of forebears who pursued war, slavery, and oppression. Black 
Africans,
Anglo-Americans, Europeans, Native Americans, North African and Middle 
Eastern
peoples, Mongols, Chinese, and Japanese--all have pursued these things when
they have had the power to, afflicting one another and weaker neighbors.<p>

For our time, the first lesson to be learned from world history, the most
compelling story, is the age-old struggle of people within each culture to
limit aggression and greed, to nourish the better side of human nature, to
apply morality and law, to keep the peace and render justice. Students can 
see
the glory and agony of this struggle, and how often it has been lost. 
Because
human evil exists, good intent has never been enough. It has taken brains,
courage, self-sacrifice, patience, love, and--always with tragic
consequences--war itself to contain the beast. Against the twin 
temptations of
wishfulness and cynicism, history says that evil and tragedy are real, that
civilization has a high price but that it, too, is real, and has been won 
from
time to time. In history we find the ideas, the conditions, and the famous 
and
ordinary men and women making it possible. <p>

All peoples have taken part in the struggle to civilize. An honest look at 
the
past reveals a common human mixture of altruism, malevolence, and 
indifference,
and reasons for all of us to feel both pride and shame. Starting from any 
other
point of view is historically false, and blind to human nature. 
Historians--and
standard setters--have a special obligation to be candid. But many popular
textbooks are unfailingly pious about other cultures and ultra-critical of 
our
own, preaching a new-style ignorance in reaction against, but just as
pernicious as, our older textbook pieties about ourselves and disdain for
others. Both are pernicious because both sap the will to civilize. People 
who
are taught to feel specially guilty, or specially victimized, or naturally
superior, will not reach out to others as equals; they will not pay the 
costs
in toil, tears, and taxes always imposed by that struggle. <p>

This is not a "conservative" or "liberal" issue but one of trusting 
children,
adolescents, and adults to work with historical truth, however 
inconvenient or
impolite it may seem. History reinforces the rough notion of equality that 
we
learn on the playground and in the street: there are like proportions of
admirable and avoidable people in every imaginable human grouping--by age,
class, race, sex, religion, or cultural taste. Individuals are not equal in
talent or virtue, and certainly not equally deserving of respect. To teach
otherwise is to invite ridicule and resentment. Instead what must 
repeatedly be
taught, because it is not quickly learned--but is quickly forgotten in hard
times--is that in civilized society it is every person's <i>rights</i> 
that are
equally deserving of respect: rights to free expression, equal protection 
under
law, fair judgment, rigorous education, honest work and pay, an equal 
chance to
pursue the good. <p>

This hard truth we accept, and remember, only with the help of historical
insight, which is indispensable in forging a democratic conscience--that 
inner
feeling that we ought to do the right thing even if only out of prudence. 
For
we see again and again that societies failing to accord a good measure of
liberty, equality, and justice have hastened their own decay, particularly 
over
the past two centuries, since the American and French revolutions told the
world that these three were the proper aims of human life and politics, and
that it was right and possible to bring them to reality--by force if 
necessary.
<p>

Student-citizens need to be acutely sensitive to the central political 
drama of
world history since the 1770s--what Sigmund Neumann called the "triple
revolution" aimed at national unity and independence, at political 
democracy
and civil rights, and at economic and social justice. This, too, is not a
liberal or conservative matter. Whether we approve or deplore these ends, 
or
the means to them, does not lessen their force or our need to deal with 
them,
at home and abroad. Modern history tells us that whenever any one of them 
is
frustrated for long, masses of people will sink to envy, self-pity, fury, 
and a
search for scapegoats, f&uuml;hrers, and quick, violent solutions. <p>

Good history is not always fun to learn, any more than is chemistry or
mathematics, and we should not pretend that it is. The job of citizen is no
easier to prepare for than that of doctor or bridge builder. Nor is good
history always popular. It denies us the comforts of optimism or 
pessimism. It
gives the lie to nostalgia, whether for left-wing or right-wing or 
feel-good
politics. Its lessons offer no cure for today's problems, only warnings we 
are
silly to ignore. As they select the essentials of U.S. and world history, 
state
and local standard setters and curriculum makers can look for the 
particulars
that teach such lessons best--memorable events, ideas, and people whose 
stories
need telling, but always in the context of longer narrative history. <p>

For example, an American-history standard should require the ability not 
only
to recall points in the Constitution and Bill of Rights but also to 
understand
the ideas and events behind them, back to Greek and Roman thought and
institutions, to Judeo-Christian views of human nature and responsibility, 
to
<a href="http://www.traveller.com/~hrweb/legal/magnacrt.html">Magna 
Carta</a> and the English Revolution, 
to <a href="gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/98/1
">Hobbes</a>, <a 
href="http://nifty.bookstore.uidaho.edu/Philosophy/Locke,John/Default.htm
">Locke</a>, and Montesquieu,
<a href="gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/55/1
">Burke</a>, <a 
href"http://nifty.bookstore.uidaho.edu/Philosophy/Paine,Thomas/Default.htm">Paine</a>, 
<a href="http://www.mcs.net/~knautzr/fed/fedpaper.html">the 
Federalists</a> and the anti-Federalists. These essentials are
not grasped by playacting a few quarrels from hot Philadelphia afternoons 
of
1787--though playacting can make a good start if the script is based on
original sources.<p>

Moreover, the lesson of the Constitution is not nearly complete without
learning the harrowing consequences of a cheap answer to labor shortages 
that
American planters were sure they had found in the early 1600s--slaves from
Africa. A tortured Constitution, belying the Declaration's promise, was 
only
one, early payment. The Civil War followed, and even 620,000 dead did not
purchase the free and equal Union for which Lincoln prayed in his <a 
href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/inaugural/pres32.html">Second
Inaugural</a>. New chains of bondage were forged, and another century of 
repression
and humiliation followed, before the civil-rights movement of the 1960s
restarted a process of liberation whose grinding slowness continues to 
divide
and embitter us.<p>

Likewise, a world-history standard on the Second World War teaches little
unless that war is seen as a consequence of the outbreak of the First 
World War
and of the murderous incompetence with which it was fought, of the 
Bolshevik
Revolution, of world depression, of the furies and civic ineptitude that
destroyed the Weimar Republic, of Hitler's rise on the shoulders of private
armies, and of the liberal democracies' wishful rejection of the costs of
collective security, from the Paris Conference of 1919 through the Spanish
Civil War to the Nazi occupation of Prague in 1939. Nor can it teach nearly
enough without examining the Holocaust, the ultimate horror, itself a
consequence of all these things and more since the Middle Ages.<p>

The fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War brought back 
the
war's satanic nature, from Rotterdam to Dresden, Nanking and Bataan to
Hiroshima. The debates over guilt revealed widespread avoidance of 
history's
warnings. Some seemed to doubt that evil exists and has to be dealt with, 
even
by making war. Others seemed to deny that any war, launched for whatever 
cause,
will carry frightful human consequences, will be as hellish as weapons 
permit.
And 1945 was not the end. The Cold War followed from the effects of both 
world
wars. Draining lives and resources, fouling our politics, skewing economic
life, it divided us against one another, from the Red scares of the 1940s 
and
1950s through the bloody Korean and Vietnam wars. Its legacy clouds our 
view of
a changing world and its needs, not least our own need to distinguish 
between
force that is necessary and force that is not. All these afflictions are
consequences of human choices back to 1914 and earlier, many of them in 
pursuit
of cheap, quick answers in defiance of history's lessons and the 
imperatives of
civilized life.

It is one of the ironies of American political history that the vanquished in

presidential campaigns often end up altering our politics more than the

victors. Barry Goldwater may have carried only six states in 1964, but by

stamping his brand of Sunbelt conservatism on the <A HREF="http://www.rnc.org/">Republican Party</A>, he changed

it and eventually the country, causing a regional realignment. George McGovern

lost in a landslide in 1972, but some of his campaign aides--including Gary

Hart and Bill Clinton--ended up playing a strong role in Democratic politics

for more than two decades. <A HREF="http://www.asc.edu/archives/govs_list/g_wallac.html">George Wallace</A> carried only a handful of

presidential primaries in his runs within the Democratic Party, and his

independent candidacy, in 1968, never had a chance. Yet it can be argued

persuasively that Wallace's populist appeals to middle-class resentment through

veiled references to race, and his constant attacks on big government and the

media, provided the model for much of American politics in the decades that

followed.<p>



The candidate himself and the media tout Buchanan's current campaign as a

crusade for the soul of Republican conservatism, and it is that. What Buchanan

really seeks to do, however, is to follow in the footsteps of Wallace--along

with those of William Jennings Bryan, <A HREF="http://moshplant.com/prob/prob01/long.html">Huey Long</A>, and Mary ("Raise Less Corn and

More Hell") Lease--by reviving populism on a national scale. Buchanan's hope is

to unite the disparate and often contradictory forces that constitute what is

left of populism--under the banner, no less, of the Republican Party, the

traditional home of those established interests that populism has usually

fought. Given populism's customary distrust of the eastern

establishment--including the media--and its roots in a kind of agrarian

Protestantism, it is also no small irony that the candidate who hopes to

assemble this coalition is a well-known member of the media establishment and

an observant Catholic. Michael Kazin, the author of the recent <i>The Populist

Persuasion</i>, calls Buchanan's candidacy "the culmination of 100 years of

populism."<p>



Populism has had a dappled history in its century or so of incarnations: the

same movements that have sought to organize "the people" against "the special

interests" have often used raw racial and nativist demagoguery to do so. And

the populist label is a mutable one, applied to everyone from <A HREF="http://www.cris.com/~Pgarber/watson.html">Tom Watson</A> to

<A HREF="http://webcorp.com/mccarthy/">Joseph McCarthy</A> to <A HREF="http://www.brainlink.com/~nota/web.htm">H. Ross Perot</A>. Yet populism can be loosely defined, with

help from Kazin, as a powerful mass movement, somewhat out of the political

mainstream, grounded in typically American language that characterizes politics

as a struggle between ordinary people and a self-serving, undemocratic elite.

That means that populism is by definition in flux; anyone who convincingly

appropriates the jargon ("special interests"), the enemies list (distant

government, the media, intellectuals, the eastern establishment), and the

enthusiasm for conspiracy theories (to explain how power got taken from "the

people") tends to appropriate the movement. <p>



Over the past century populism has moved from its southern agrarian roots

through the labor insurgencies of the Progressive era, the Prohibition

movement, the "Share-the-Wealth" movements of the 1930s, and the white backlash

of the past thirty years. For most of its history populism was loosely linked

to the Democratic Party, the traditional home of the working classes, and party

rhetoric and policy reflected that state of affairs. Yet, as Thomas and Mary

Edsall pointed out in the May, 1991, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, the increasing

identification of the Democratic Party with the race and rights revolutions of

the 1960s--and with big government supported by high taxes--allowed it to be

increasingly portrayed as a defender not only of the status quo but also of

cultural if not economic elites. Today the most obvious heirs to the populist

tradition are either loosely allied with the Republicans (Pat Robertson, with

his religious fundamentalism) or are the sort who would have been targets of

populism a century ago (Ross Perot, the modern equivalent of J. P. Morgan or

Andrew Carnegie). In a world in which government is portrayed as the real enemy

of "the people," the populist impulse has begun to gravitate to the Republican

Party and to people populism once despised. <p>



There are portents of Buchanan in previous Republican presidential candidacies,

though one has to go back a while to find some of them. His "America First"

foreign policy isn't far from the views of prominent midwestern Republicans

from 1920 to 1952: Senator Robert Taft, after all, opposed the NATO treaty, and

Senator Arthur Vandenberg was an isolationist for much of his political life.

Buchanan's opposition to most civil-rights legislation--including (on

constitutional grounds) the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964--recalls Barry

Goldwater. And Buchanan's onetime boss, Ronald Reagan, certainly portrayed

himself as an outsider who would return Washington and the federal government

to "the people."<p>

 

<font size=5>T</font>EMPERAMENTALLY and rhetorically, however, Buchanan is anything but a typical

Republican. Instead he clearly falls into the populist tradition--which is why

he often sounds more like an old-time Democrat on the hustings than any current

member of that party, including the incumbent. "I've been waiting my whole life

for someone running for President to talk about the <i>Fortune</i> 500 as the

enemy," the reporter Tom Carson, of the liberal <i><A HREF="http://www.villagevoice.com/">Village Voice</A></i>, told

Buchanan, "and when Ifinally get my wish, it turns out to be you." On the stump

Buchanan says, "We've seen the real income of men who work with their hands,

tools, and machines decline. The Dow Jones average went up about twenty percent

in six months; the real income of American workers went down two-point-three

percent." That's not the kind of talk one hears from Clinton, much less from

Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, Newt Gingrich, or even Rush Limbaugh. They all supported

the <A HREF="gopher://wiretap.spies.com/11/Gov/NAFTA">North American Free Trade 

Agreement</A>; Buchanan joined Perot and <A HREF="http://www.competition96.com/jackson/jackson.htm">Jesse

Jackson</A> in opposing it. Dole, <A HREF="http://www.gramm96.org/">Gramm</A>, and Gingrich tend to downplay social

issues; Buchanan wears his social conservatism and opposition to abortion as a

badge of honor. From his class-warfare protectionist rhetoric to his nativist

isolationism, from his constant dark barbs thrown at Wall Street and the

establishment to his well-publicized indulgence in ugly, quite possibly

anti-Semitic talk, Buchanan has less in common with the personas of the genial

Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan than with those of <A HREF="http://archives1.archives.nd.edu/PCGH.HTM ">Father Charles Coughlin</A>

and Tom Watson, who, it has been said, "talked like the thrust of a Bowie

knife." When Buchanan announces that he will "take America back for the things

we believe in," or says "I want to say today to all the globalists up there in

Tokyo and New York and Paris, when I raise my hand to take that oath of office,

your new world order comes crashing down," his style isn't much 

different.<p>

 

It's no surprise that there are constituencies for such rhetoric in an era when

voters feel increasingly alienated from politics and government. Those who have

observed the enthusiastic reception Buchanan has gotten at prayer breakfasts,

or at rallies held at the barricaded doors of closed New Hampshire factories,

or at the United We Stand convention in Dallas last August, where he drew the

loudest cheers, know that he is striking chords among diverse audiences. Though

Buchanan lacks the fundraising apparatus of the more conventional party

candidates, such as Dole, Gramm, and <A HREF="http://www.Nashville.Net/~lamar/">Lamar Alexander</A>, he does possess tactical

advantages. He alone mounted a primary challenge to George Bush in 1992--which

gave him a chance to hone his message and his organization. The current field

of Washington insiders--Dole, Gramm, <A HREF="http://www.iquest.net/lugar/lugar.htm">Richard Lugar</A>, even Alexander, who served

significant stints in Washington--gives Buchanan rhetorical traction. And

because Buchanan is a media celebrity, he is better known than anyone else in

the field except Dole. Buchanan made a point of his celebrity when he announced

his presidential candidacy in 1991, bragging, "No other American has spent as

many hundreds of hours debating the great questions of our day, on national

television." Buchanan's membership in the fraternity of pundits has also given

him a kind of respectability that might elude someone like George Wallace, not

to mention immunity from the negative coverage he might attract for some of his

more inflammatory statements.<p>



Certainly Buchanan has written and said some things that if uttered by

Alexander, Dole, or Clinton would be considered political suicide. At one point

Buchanan seemed to blame only Jewish commentators (Abe Rosenthal, Charles

Krauthammer, Richard Perle, and Henry Kissinger) for helping to precipitate the

Gulf War--one of several observations that led his fellow conservative William

F. Buckley to conclude in a celebrated 1991 essay in the <i><A HREF="http://www.enews.com/magazines/national_review/">National Review</A>

</i>that Buchanan may well have occasionally crossed the line into

anti-Semitism. Yet Buchanan's attacks are only part of a much greater

belligerence he has always displayed toward his enemies; this is a pundit who

wears his insensitivities on his sleeve. Buchanan vehemently opposed the

establishment of a national holiday for Martin Luther King Jr., once described

Adolf Hitler as "an individual of great courage . . . extraordinary gifts,"

called the old apartheid regime in South Africa "an outpost of Western empire

and Western civilization," and described AIDS as the "retribution" of nature

against those "who have declared war" upon it. <p>



It may be that Buchanan has been saying such things for so long that his

Washington media friends no longer hear them, or that the "private sweetness"

described by those who know him overcomes his public belligerence in their

eyes. What is apparent, however, is that Buchanan's stridency doesn't sit well

when he moves beyond his populist cadre or inside-the-Beltway talk shows to

speak to a broader national audience. <A HREF="http://www.iac.net/~davcam/buchspee.html ">When he addressed such an audience--in

prime time, at the 1992 Republican National Convention</A>--he used the occasion to

describe Hillary Clinton as a radical feminist who had no place in "God's

country," called Al Gore an "environmental extremist" who would put "insects,

rats, and birds ahead of families, workers, and jobs," and explained how the

military might be forced to liberate urban America, block by block. The speech

is widely regarded as having launched a tremendous backlash against the

convention which discredited the Republican Party and helped to elect 

Clinton.<p>

 

<font size=5>A</font>NOTHER novel aspect of Buchanan's candidacy is its religious dimension.

The rural populists of a century ago had something of an anti-Catholic animus,

fueled by their belief that recent Catholic immigrants were responsible for the

machine politics of the urban North. More important, no serious Republican

presidential contender has ever been Catholic. (Alexander Haig, who is

Catholic, did seek the party's nomination, in 1988.) Virtually everyone who

writes about Buchanan, including himself, talks about his strong roots in the

deeply religious and traditional Catholic enclaves of midcentury Washington,

D.C.:he comes from a family of eleven, was raised in Blessed Sacrament parish,

attended Gonzaga High School, run by Jesuits, and Georgetown University, as a

day student. It was in this close-knit community that Buchanan was "born and

bred a brawler," as one writer put it, and came to see himself, and others like

him, as perpetual outsiders in the then largely WASPworld of elite Washington.

Thus the identification with fellow Catholic Joseph McCarthy, who was admired,

Buchanan once wrote, "because for four years he was daily kicking the living

hell out of people most Americans concluded ought to have the living hell

kicked out of them."<p>



A generation ago that strong cultural and religious identification would have

made it impossible for Buchanan to prosper in the Republican Party. Urban

Catholics had always been a key part of the old Democratic coalition--a trend

that peaked in 1960. Though Buchanan supported Nixon over John F. Kennedy,

Catholics gave the Democrat 78 percent of their votes--the highest proportion

ever. Yet since that election Catholics have been slowly drifting away from the

Democratic Party, disinclined to support its cultural liberalism. Whereas the

meaningful religious dividing line in American politics was until recently

between Catholic Democrats and Protestant Republicans, today it is between

those who are deeply religious (and tend to be Republican) and those who are

not. That shift has allowed Buchanan to try to lay claim to the leadership of a

fundamentalist, essentially Protestant movement in politics that several

decades earlier would have opposed him because of his religion. <p>



Yet for all the focus in the media on Buchanan--he even made the cover of

<i>Time</i> in November--he remains a very long way from the nomination and

still faces enormous hurdles. It has been the dream of populists for a century

that the various elements of "the disenfranchised" could somehow be persuaded

to see beyond their own narrow societal interests and join with others

similarly situated. Yet putting together a coalition of economic, social-issue,

and disaffected western populists would seem to be terribly difficult in our

atomized culture. Perot, for example, attracts economic populists with his

anti-free-trade and anti-immigration views, but his appeal is to secular

voters; he made a somewhat poor showing among fundamentalists in 1992.

Conversely, Pat Robertson might attract some of those fundamentalist voters--as

he did in 1988, when he finished a surprise second in the Iowa

caucuses, ahead of George Bush--but his appeal to other groups is limited. How

Buchanan could appeal to each of these factions, much less merge them, is hard

to imagine.<p>



More important, most of Buchanan's potential voters are not traditional

Republicans; many, in fact, pride themselves on their independent status.

"Buchanan has a vote," says the Republican pollster Ed Goeas. "The question is

whether it's a Republican vote." Although Democratic primaries often attract

disaffected voters who support a protest candidate, Republican primaries have

never yet done so. This is the party, after all, that since 1948 has always

nominated someone running at or near the top of national polls a year before

the election. The Republican Party may be changing demographically, but it

still tends to be dominated in the primaries by its traditional Main Street,

suburban-country-club constituency, which has been staunchly internationalist

and free-trade for the past half century. Even the new wave of

Gingrich-inspired Republican freshmen march far more to this tune than to

anything sung by Buchanan. To win primaries, Buchanan will have to persuade

many of his potential supporters to register as Republicans for the first time,

or at least to vote in a Republican primary open to independents. It is

impossible to find a reputable political analyst who thinks that Buchanan could

actually pull off this hostile takeover of the Republican Party. <p>



That's why some of his admirers, among them <A HREF="http://www.wavefront.com/~contra_m/speeches/political/phillips1.html">Howard Phillips, the conservative

chairman of the U.S. Taxpayers Alliance</A>, say that Buchanan can maximize his

impact only by running as an independent candidate in the general election.

They argue, somewhat persuasively, that "outsiders" rarely fare well in

political parties, which are, after all, establishment institutions.

Self-styled populists have made the strongest impact on our politics by running

for President as independents and then enjoying the winner's courtship of their

constituencies--Nixon of Wallace supporters, Republicans and Democrats of the

Perot vote. The analyst Kevin Phillips estimates that if Buchanan were to run

against a moderate Republican as an independent in 1996 (and assuming Perot

does not), he might draw somewhere between six and twelve percent--quite a

respectable showing by historical standards. <p>



Unlike many of his populist predecessors, however, Buchanan so far has seemed

strongly disinclined to bolt his party and go it alone. He has always had a

fierce sense of loyalty, but it goes beyond even that. His 1988 autobiography,

<i>Right From the Beginning</i>, is a revealing 300-plus-page recital of a

lifetime of fights: Buchanan recounts with joy every childhood acquaintance he

decked (there were quite a few)and every brawl he joined. In fact, what's

remarkable about Buchanan's autobiography is that although most books about

politicians make short work of childhood to get to the politics, Buchanan's

book has a terrible time leaving home. All candidates seem to have an

emblematic story that they like to tell or that gets told by others: Dole's is

about his war wound; Clinton's is about standing up as a teenager to his

abusive stepfather. Buchanan's seems to be about, of all things, the time he as

a college student got into a fight with some policemen. He was expelled from

Georgetown because of the incident, but through his father's intercession he

was allowed to return the following year.<p>



All the fights in Buchanan's book have this vaguely adolescent quality: Pat

brawls; Pat gets into trouble; Pat gets bailed out in the end by Dad or his

surrogate, because he really didn't mean it. His supposed belligerence

notwithstanding, the policemen story is the exception that proves the rule:

Buchanan seems to duck meaningful confrontations--or at least confrontations

that might have consequences. He professes a love of fighting but he never

served in the military. Peggy Noonan, in her book <i>What I Saw at the

Revolution</i>, relates that she was struck by how sweet and uncombative

Buchanan was amid all the infighting he encountered in his role as

communications director for Reagan. "Pat spent half his time in the [Reagan]

White House trying to dodge fights, which wasn't easy," she wrote. If Buchanan

is "the pit bull of the American right," as George Will has described him, he

has a peculiar ability to avoid biting grown-ups--except those policemen.<p>



There is nothing wrong, of course, with choosing your fights, though doing so

is a bit odd for a figure who makes truculence his calling card. But it does

tell us why the Buchanan campaign may in the end not change American politics

or the Republican Party nearly as much as it has the potential to do. Because

populism is an anti-establishment movement that whips up passions, it can be

dangerous to its practitioners: a true populist has to alienate powerful people

at the top, which is one reason why so many populist leaders have ended up in

disgrace. Pat Buchanan has shown himself to be a man who likes to go back to

his comfortable suburban-Washington home at the end of the day to write his

columns, read poetry, and hobnob with his friends in the establishment worlds

of politics and the media. There's nothing wrong with loving friends and home

so much you can never leave them. But if your home is the corridor of power

known as Washington, D.C., the current focus of populist resentment in America,

it's hard to do that and also become the tribune of the disenfranchised and the

angry.

	<i><font size=4>At the heart of the gun-control debate is a fundamental 

	tension between republicanism and individualism.</i></font><p>

	

	<br>

	

	<font size=5>C</font>ALMLY, patiently, with considerable bravery, the instructor at the shooting

range shows me how to fire the submachine gun, a <A HREF="http://www.prairienet.org/guns/arms/m10.htm">MAC-11</A>--the first real gun I

have ever held. It jams repeatedly. "That's why they call it a Jam-o-matic,"

someone says. Finally, anticlimactically, like an idiot, I am shooting up the

floor (the instructor told me to aim down). Seven or eight men standing behind

me await their turns. <p>



The fully automatic MAC-11--small, relatively lightweight, with little

recoil--is less intimidating than the semi-automatic rifles, which I can't

quite bring myself to use. I am anxious enough around the handguns. "Lean

forward," the instructor keeps telling me, while I lean back, trying to get as

far away from the gun as I can. How do thirteen-year-olds do this? I wonder,

trying not to hurt myself with a huge, heavy revolver. I jump every time a shot

is fired (and can't wait for the guys to stop playing with the machine gun). I

can barely get the slide back on one of the semi-automatic handguns. But I'm

pleased when I hit the target with the 9mm <A HREF="http://www.winternet.com/~jknoll/protector.html">Glock</A>, the only one of these guns I

can imagine being able to use. And when someone offers me a casing from the

<A HREF="http://www.hol.gr/people/sv1cec/ppks.gif">Walther PPK</A> I've just shot (James Bond's gun, everyone points out), I pocket

it.<p>



I've been invited to the shooting range to "observe and try out the right to

bear arms in action," along with about twenty other participants in a two-day

seminar on guns and the Constitution, sponsored by <A HREF="http://www.saf.org/pub/rkba/wais/data_files/aphrodite/academics">Academics for the Second

Amendment</A>. Funded partly by the <A HREF="http://www.nra.org/">National Rifle Association</A>, Academics for the

Second Amendment isn't exactly a collection of academic gun nuts--most of its

more than 500 members aren't academics, and its president, Joseph Olson, an NRA

board member and a professor at Hamline Law School, in Minnesota, seems a

rational, open-minded man. But the organization is engaged in a genteel

lobbying effort to popularize what many liberals consider the gun nut's view of

the Second Amendment: that it confers an individual right to bear arms, not

just the right to bear arms in a well-regulated militia. <p>



Since it was founded, in 1992, Academics for the Second Amendment has held four

by-invitation-only seminars for academics who share its beliefs about the

Second Amendment--or might be persuaded to adopt them. The year before last I

asked permission to attend a seminar but was turned down; last year I received

an unsolicited invitation, apparently in response to an article in which I had

questioned the effectiveness of traditional approaches to gun control. <p>



Don Kates, who is a San Francisco lawyer, a gun aficionado, and the author of

numerous articles on guns and the Constitution, leads the seminar

energetically, taking only a little time out to show us pictures of his parrot.

His approach is scattershot, or spray and pray. Ranging over legal, moral, and

practical arguments for private gun ownership, he discusses self-defense and

the deterrent effect of an armed citizenry; the correlation between guns and

crime; difficulties of enforcing gun controls; bigotry against gun owners; and,

finally, constitutional rights. Comments by participants are sometimes sensible

and occasionally insane: one man proclaims that mothers should give guns to

children who attend dangerous public schools.<p>



"What would you do if you had a fourteen-year-old kid who felt he needed a gun

for self-defense?" he asks me repeatedly.<p>



"I'd take him out of school before giving him a gun."<p>



But even among gun advocates there is relatively little support for the rights

of juveniles to own guns, or opposition to bans on juvenile ownership.

Opposition to gun prohibitions focuses on attempts to disarm more or less sane,

law-abiding adults, who are deemed to be endowed with both natural and

constitutional rights to self-defense against criminals and despots.<p>



Like moral and legal claims about gun owners' rights, the practical

consequences of widespread gun ownership are highly debatable. No one can say

with any certainty whether it increases violence or decreases crime. Don Kates

speculates that magically reducing the approximately 200 million firearms in

circulation to five million would have virtually no reductive effect on the

crime rate: according to a 1983 National Institute of Justice-funded study by

James D. Wright, Peter H. Rossi, and Kathleen Daly, about one percent of

privately owned firearms are involved in criminal activity, suggesting that

eliminating 99 percent of the nation's guns would not ameliorate crime. Or

would it? <A HREF="http://www.econ.duke.edu/Econ/Faculty/Users/pcook.html">Philip Cook, an economist at Duke University</A> and a leading researcher

on gun violence, considers Kates's speculation about the uselessness of

reducing the number of guns "patently absurd."We can't predict which guns will

be used in crimes, he says, even if a relatively small number are used

feloniously overall. Reducing the availability of guns would raise their price

and therefore reduce their accessibility, to adult felons as well as juveniles.

And even if a drastic reduction in the number of guns wouldn't necessarily

decrease crime, it would decrease fatalities. Guns are particularly lethal,

Cook has stressed: the "fraction of serious gun assaults that result in the

victim's death is much higher than that of assaults with other weapons." Since

not all gun homicides reflect a clearly formulated intent to kill, Cook

reasons, access to guns can increase the lethality of assaults. A decrease in

the use of guns, however, might lead to an increase in nonfatal injuries.

Robberies committed with guns tend to involve less violence than other

robberies because the victims are less likely to resist. (Cook speculates that

victims who do resist robbers armed with guns are more likely to be killed.)<p>



Debates about gun ownership and gun control are driven more by values and

ideology than by pragmatism--and hardly at all by the existing empirical

research, which is complex and inconclusive. Wright, Rossi, and Daly reported

that there is not even any "suggestive evidence" showing that "gun ownership .

. . as a whole is, per se, an important cause of criminal violence." The

evidence that guns deter criminal violence is equally insubstantial, they

added, as is evidence that additional gun controls would reduce crime. Many are

already in place and rarely, if ever, enforced; or they make no sense. In 1983

Wright, Rossi, and Daly concluded that the "benefits of stricter gun controls .

. . are at best uncertain, and at worst close to nil."<p>



As for legal debates about the existence of constitutional rights, empirical

data is irrelevant, or at best peripheral. But the paucity of proof that gun

controls lessen crime is particularly galling to people who believe that they

have a fundamental right to bear arms. In theory, at least, we restrict

constitutional rights only when the costs of exercising them seem unbearably

high. In fact we argue continually about what those costs are: Does violence in

the media cause violence in real life? Did the release of the Pentagon Papers

endanger the national security? Does hate speech constitute discrimination? In

the debate about firearms, however, we can't even agree on the principles that

should govern restrictions on guns, because we can't agree about the right to

own them.<p>



How could we, given the importance of the competing values at stake--public

safety and the right of self-defense--and the opacity of the constitutional

text? The awkwardly drafted Second Amendment doesn't quite make itself clear:

"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the

right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." Is the

reference to a militia a limitation on the right to bear arms or merely an

explanation of an armed citizenry's role in a government by consent? There is

little dispute that one purpose of the Second Amendment was to ensure that the

people would be able to resist a central government should it ever devolve into

despotism. But there is little agreement about what that capacity for

resistance was meant to entail--armed citizens acting under the auspices of

state militias or armed citizens able to organize and act on their own. And

there is virtually no consensus about the constitutional right to own a gun in

the interests of individual self-defense against crime, rather than communal

defense against tyranny. Is defense of the state, and of the common good, the

<i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the Second Amendment or merely one use of 

it?<p> 



<font size=5>T</font>HE Supreme Court has never answered these fundamental questions about the

constitutional uses of guns. <A HREF="http://www.shadeslanding.com/firearms/fedcases.2nd.html">It has paid scant attention to the Second

Amendment, providing little guidance in the gun-control debate</A>. Two frequently

cited late-nineteenth-century cases relating to the Second Amendment were more

about federalism than about the right to bear arms. 

<i><A HREF="http://www.saf.org/pub/rkba/wais/data_files/nra/courts/94-12-08_federal_cases_regarding_second_amendment">Presser</i> v.

<i>Illinois</a></i>, decided in 1886, involved a challenge to a state law

prohibiting private citizens from organizing their own military units and

parades. The Court held that the Second Amendment was a limitation on federal,

not state, power, reflecting the prevailing view (now discredited) that the

Bill of Rights in general applied only to the federal government, not to the

states. (A hundred years ago the Court did not apply the First Amendment to the

states either.) <i>Presser</i> followed 

<i><a href= "http://www.saf.org/pub/rkba/wais/data_files

/nra/courts/94-12-08_federal_cases_regarding_second_amendment">U.S. </i>v. <i>

Cruikshank</a></i>, which

held that the federal government could not protect people from private

infringement of their rights to assemble and bear arms. <i>Cruikshank</i>,

decided in 1876, invalidated the federal convictions of participants in the

lynching of two black men. This ruling, essentially concerned with limiting

federal police power, is virtually irrelevant to Second Amendment debates

today, although it has been cited to support the proposition that an oppressed

minority has a compelling need (or a natural right) to bear arms in

self-defense.<p>



The most significant Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment was

<i><a href= "http://www.saf.org/pub/rkba/wais/data_files

/nra/courts/94-12-08_federal_cases_regarding_second_amendment">U.S.</i> v. 

<i>Miller </i>(1939)</A>, a less-than-definitive holding now cited

approvingly by both sides in the gun-control debate. <i>Miller</i> involved a

prosecution under the 1934 National Firearms Act. Jack Miller and his

accomplice had been convicted of transporting an unregistered shotgun of less

than regulation length across state lines. In striking down their Second

Amendment claim and upholding their conviction, the Court noted that no

evidence had been presented that a shotgun was in fact a militia weapon,

providing no factual basis for a Second Amendment claim. This ruling implies

that the Second Amendment could protect the right to bear arms suitable for a

militia.<p>



Advocates of gun control or prohibition like the Miller case because it makes

the right to bear arms dependent on at least the possibility of service in a

militia. They cite the Court's declaration that the Second Amendment was

obviously intended to "assure the continuation and render possible the

effectiveness" of state militias; they place less emphasis on the Court's

apparent willingness to permit private citizens to possess military weapons.

Citing <i>Miller</i>, a dealer at a gun show told me that the Second Amendment

protects the ownership of only such devices as machine guns, Stingers, and

grenade throwers. But advocates of gun ownership don't generally emphasize this

awkward implication of <i>U.S.</i> v. <i>Miller</i> any more than their

opponents do: it could lead to prohibitions on handguns. They like the

<i>Miller</i> decision because it delves into the history of the Second

Amendment and stresses that for the framers, the militia "comprised all males

physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense."<p>



This view of the militia as an inchoate citizens' army, not a standing body of

professionals, is central to the claim that the Second Amendment protects the

rights of individual civilians, not simply the right of states to organize and

arm militias. And, in fact, fear and loathing of standing armies did underlie

the Second Amendment, which was at least partly intended to ensure that states

would be able to call up citizens in defense against a tyrannical central

government. (Like the Bill of Rights in general, the Second Amendment was

partly a response to concerns about federal abuses of power.) James Madison,

the author of the Second Amendment, invoked in <i><A HREF="http://www.shadeslanding.com/firearms/federalist.html">The Federalist Papers</A> </i>the

potential force of a citizen militia as a guarantee against a federal military

coup.

Let a regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and

let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government: still it would

not be going too far to say that the State governments with the people on their

side would be able to repel the danger. . . . To [the regular army] would be

opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in

their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their

common liberties and united and conducted by governments possessing their

affection and confidence. It may well be doubted whether a militia thus

circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops.

Those who are best acquainted with the late successful resistance of this

country against the British arms will be most inclined to deny the possibility

of it. Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over

the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate

governments, to which the people are attached and by which the militia officers

are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more

insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit 

of.</blockquote><p>





This passage is enthusiastically cited by advocates of the right to bear arms,

because it supports their notion of the militia as the body of people,

privately armed; but it's also cited by their opponents, because it suggests

that the militia is activated and "conducted" by the states, and it stresses

that citizens are "attached" to their local governments. The militia envisioned

by Madison is not simply a "collection of unorganized, privately armed

citizens," Dennis Henigan, a handgun-control advocate, has argued. <p>



That Madison's reflections on the militia and the Supreme Court's holding in

<i>U.S.</i> v. <i>Miller</i> can be cited with some accuracy by both sides in

the debate testifies to the hybrid nature of Second Amendment rights. The

Second Amendment presumes (as did the framers) that private citizens will

possess private arms; Madison referred offhandedly to "the advantage of being

armed, which the Americans possess." But Madison also implied that the right to

bear arms is based in the obligation of citizens to band together as a militia

to defend the common good, as opposed to the prerogative of citizens to take up

arms individually in pursuit of self-interest and happiness.<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE tension at the heart of the Second Amendment, which makes it so difficult

to construe, is the tension between republicanism and liberal individualism.

(To put it very simply, republicanism calls for the subordination of individual

interests to the public good; liberalism focuses on protecting individuals

against popular conceptions of the good.) A growing body of scholarly

literature on the Second Amendment locates the right to bear arms in republican

theories of governance. <A HREF="http://www.rru.com/~jds/politics/rkba/embar.html">In a 1989 article in the <i>Yale Law Journal</i> that

helped animate the Second Amendment debate</A>, the University of Texas law

professor Sanford Levinson argued that the Second Amendment confers an

individual right to bear arms so that, in the republican tradition, armed

citizens might rise up against an oppressive state. Wendy Brown, a professor of

women's studies at the University of California at Santa Cruz, and David C.

Williams, a law professor at Cornell University, have questioned the validity

of a republican right to bear arms in a society that lacks the republican

virtue of being willing to put communal interests first. Pro-gun activists

don't generally acknowledge the challenge posed by republicanism to the

individualist culture that many gun owners inhabit. They embrace republican

justifications for gun ownership, stressing the use of arms in defending the

community, at the same time that they stress the importance of guns in

protecting individual autonomy.<p>



Advocates of the right to bear arms often insist that the Second Amendment is

rooted in both collective and individual rights of self-defense--against

political oppression and crime--without recognizing how those rights conflict.

The republican right to resist oppression is the right of the majority, or the

people, not the right of a small religious cult in Waco, Texas, or of a few

survivalist tax protesters in Idaho. The members of these groups have

individual rights against the government, state and federal. (Both the <A HREF="http://ds.internic.net/cgi-bin/enthtml/legal/aclu-gopher.b">American

Civil Liberties Union</A> and the NRA protested the government's actions in Waco

and its attack on the survivalist Randy Weaver and his family.) But refuseniks

and refugees from society are not republicans. They do not constitute the

citizen militia envisioned by the framers, any more than they stand for the

American community; indeed, they stand against it--withdrawing from the body

politic, asserting their rights to alienation and anomie or membership in

exclusionary alternative communities of their own. Republicanism can't

logically be invoked in the service of libertarianism. It elevates civic virtue

over individualism, consensus over dissent. <p>



Nor can social-contract theory be readily invoked in support of a right to arm

yourself in a war against street crime, despite the claims of some

gun-ownership advocates. The right or power to engage in punishment or

retribution is precisely what is given up when you enter an ordered civil

society. The loss of self-help remedies is the price of the social contract.

"God hath certainly appointed Government to restrain the partiality and

violence of Men," 

<A HREF="http://swift.eng.ox.ac.uk/jdr/locke.html">John Locke</A> wrote. A person may always defend his or her life

when threatened, but only when there is no chance to appeal to the law. If a

man points his sword at me and demands my purse, Locke explained, I may kill

him. But if he steals my purse by stealth and then raises a sword to defend it,

I may not use force to get it back. "My Life not being in danger, I may have

the <i>benefit of appealing</i> to the Law, and have Reparation for my 100

<i>l.</i> that way." <p>



Locke was drawing a line between self-defense and vigilantism which many gun

owners would no doubt respect. Others would point to the inability of the

criminal-justice system to avenge crimes and provide reparation to victims, and

thus they would assert a right to engage in self-help. Social-contract theory,

however, might suggest that if the government is no longer able to provide

order, or justice, the remedy is not vigilantism but revolution; the utter

failure of law enforcement is a fundamental breach of trust. And, in fact,

there are large pockets of disaffected citizens who do not trust the government

to protect them or to provide impartial justice, and who might be persuaded to

rise up against it, as evidenced by the disorder that followed the 1992

acquittal of police officers who assaulted Rodney King. Was Los Angeles the

scene of a riot or of an uprising? <p>



Injustice, and the sense of oppression it spawns, are often matters of

perspective--particularly today, when claims of political victimization abound

and there is little consensus on the demands of public welfare. We use the term

"oppression" promiscuously, to describe any instance of discrimination. In this

climate of grievance and hyperbole, many acts of violence are politicized. How

do we decide whether an insurrection is just? Don Kates observes that the

Second Amendment doesn't exactly confer the right to resist. He says, "It gives

you a right to win."<p>



The prospect of armed resistance, however, is probably irrelevant to much

public support for gun ownership, which reflects a fear of crime more than a

fear or loathing of government. People don't buy guns in order to overthrow or

even to thwart the government; in the belief that the police can't protect

them, people buy guns to protect themselves and their families. Recognizing

this, the NRA appeals to fear of crime, particularly crime against women.

("Choose to refuse to be a victim," NRA ads proclaim, showing a woman and her

daughter alone in a desolate parking lot at night.) And it has countered

demands for tougher gun controls not with radical individualist appeals for

insurrection but with statist appeals for tougher anti-crime laws, notably

stringent mandatory-minimum sentences and parole reform. There is considerable

precedent for the NRA's appeal to state authority: founded after the Civil War,

with the mission of teaching soldiers to shoot straight, in its early years the

NRA was closely tied to the military and dependent on government largesse;

until recently it drew considerable moral support from the police. Today,

however, statist anti-crime campaigns are mainly matters of politics for the

NRA and for gun advocates in general; laws mandating tough sentences for the

criminal use of firearms defuse demands for firearm controls. Personal

liberty--meaning the liberty to own guns and use them against the government if

necessary--is these people's passion. <p>



Gun advocates are apt to be extravagantly libertarian when the right to own

guns is at stake. At heart many are insurrectionists--at least, they need to

feel prepared. Nothing arouses their anger more, I've found, than challenges to

the belief that private gun ownership is an essential check on political

oppression.

<p>

 

<font size=5>D</font>URING the two-day seminar held by Academics for the Second Amendment, we argue

equanimously about nearly everything--crime control, constitutional rights, and

the fairness and feasibility of gun controls--until I question whether, 200

years after the Revolution, citizens armed with rifles and handguns can

effectively resist the federal government. I ask, If Nixon had staged a

military coup in 1974--assuming he had military support--instead of resigning

the presidency, could the NRA and the nation's unaffiliated gun owners have

stopped him? For the first time in two days Don Kates flares up in anger, and

the room is incandescent.<p>



"Give me one example from history of a successful government oppression of an

armed populace," he demands. The FBI raid on David Koresh's compound in Waco,

Texas, doesn't count, he says, because Koresh's group was a small, isolated

minority. The Civil War doesn't count either. (I can't remember why.) Neither

do uprisings in Malaysia and the Philippines. <p>



People like me think it is possible to oppose the government only with nuclear

weapons, Kates rages, because we're stupid; we don't understand military

strategy and the effectiveness of guerrilla warfare, and we underestimate the

hesitancy of troops to engage their fellow citizens in armed conflict. Millions

of Americans armed only with pistols and long guns could turn a bloodless coup

into a prolonged civil war. <p>



Perhaps. I am almost persuaded that Kates might have a point, until he brings

up the Holocaust.<p>



Gun advocates sometimes point out that the Holocaust was preceded by

gun-control laws that disarmed the Jews and made it easy to round them up. (In

a 1994 article in <i>Guns and Ammo</i>, Jay Simkin, the president of <A HREF="http://www.public.asu.edu/~brickner/rkba/jpfo.html">Jews for

the Preservation of Firearms Ownership</A>, argued that gun control causes

genocide. Simkin wrote that today "genocides can be prevented if civilians

worldwide own military-type rifles and plenty of ammunition.") Kates doesn't go

nearly this far, but he does point out that genocides are difficult to predict.

At the turn of the century, he says, I would not have predicted the Holocaust,

and today I can't predict what holocausts may occur in the next fifteen or

fifty years. I give up. "If millions are slaughtered in the next fifty years

because of gun-control laws," I declare, "let their deaths be on my head."<p>



"It's very interesting that you say that," Kates concludes, a bit

triumphantly.<p>



Kates apologizes later for his outburst, and in a subsequent phone conversation

he acknowledges that "the Holocaust was not an event where guns would have

mattered; the force was overwhelming." But he adds that guns might have

mattered to individual Jews who could have saved themselves had they been

armed, even if the Jewish community couldn't have saved itself collectively.

And guns might matter to a Croatian woman who shoots a Serbian soldier breaking

into her house, he suggests; if there were a Second Amendment in Bosnia, it

would protect her.<p>



Zealots in the pro-gun camp (Kates is not among them) seem to identify with the

woman defending her home to the extent that they fear attack by the federal

government. "Using a national epidemic of crime and violence as their

justification, media pundits and collectivist politicians are aggressively

campaigning to disarm private citizens and strengthen federal law enforcement

powers," proclaims a special edition of <i>The New American</i>, a magazine on

sale at gun shows. After gun control, the editors suggest, the greatest threat

to individual liberty is the Clinton plan for providing local police

departments with federal assistance. "Is it possible that some of those who are

advocating a disarmed populace and a centralized police system have

totalitarian designs in mind? It is worth noting that this is exactly what

happened in many countries during this century."<p>



This can be dismissed as ravings on the fringe, but it captures in crazed form

the hostility toward a powerful central government which inspired the adoption

of the Second Amendment right to bear arms 200 years ago and fuels support for

it today. Advocates of First Amendment rights, who believe firmly that free

speech is both a moral imperative and an instrument of democratic governance,

should understand the passion of Second Amendment claims. <p>



They should be sympathetic as well to the more dispassionate constitutional

arguments of gun owners. Civil libertarians who believe that the Bill of Rights

in general protects individuals have a hard time explaining why the Second

Amendment protects only groups. They have a hard time reconciling their

opposition to prohibitions of problematic behavior, such as drug abuse, with

their support for the prohibition of guns. (Liberals tend to demonize guns and

gun owners the way conservatives tend to demonize drugs and pornography and the

people who use them.) In asserting that the Second Amendment provides no

individual right to bear arms or that the right provided is anachronistic and

not worth its cost, civil libertarians place themselves in the awkward position

of denying the existence of a constitutional right because they don't value its

exercise.<p>



The civil-libertarian principles at issue in the gun debate are made clear by the

arguments of First Amendment and Second Amendment advocates, which are

strikingly similar--as are the arguments their opponents use. Pornography

rapes, some feminists say. Words oppress, according to advocates of censoring

hate speech. "Words Kill," declared a Planned Parenthood ad following the

abortion-clinic shootings in Brookline, Massachusetts, last year. And all you

can say in response is "Words don't kill people; people kill people." To an

anti-libertarian, the literature sold at gun shows may seem as dangerous as the

guns; at a recent gun show I bought Incendiaries, an army manual on

unconventional warfare; Exotic Weapons: An Access Book; Gunrunning for Fun and

Profit; and Vigilante Handbook, which tells me how to harass, torture, and

assassinate people. Should any of this material be censored? If it were, it

would be sold on the black market; and the remedy for bad speech is good

speech, First Amendment devotees point out. According to Second Amendment

supporters, gun-control laws affect only law-abiding gun owners, and the best

defense against armed criminals is armed victims; the remedy for the bad use of

guns in violent crime is the good use of guns in self-defense.<p> 



Of course, guns do seem a bit more dangerous than books, and apart from a few

anti-pornography feminists, most of us would rather be accosted by a man with a

video than a man with a gun. But none of our constitutional rights are

absolute. Recognizing that the Second Amendment confers an individual right to

bear arms would not immunize guns from regulation; it would require that the

government establish a necessity, not just a desire, to regulate. The majority

of gun owners, Don Kates suggests, would be amenable to gun controls, such as

waiting periods and even licensing and training requirements, if they didn't

perceive them as preludes to prohibition. The irony of the Second Amendment

debate is that acknowledging an individual right to bear arms might facilitate

gun control more than denying it ever could.<p>



But it will not facilitate civic engagement or the community that Americans are

exhorted to seek. The civil-libertarian defense of Second Amendment rights is

not a republican one. It does not derive the individual right to bear arms from

republican notions of the militia; instead it relies on traditional liberal

views of personal autonomy. It is a communitarian nightmare. If the war against

crime has replaced the Cold War in popular culture, a private storehouse of

guns has replaced the fallout shelter in the psyche of Americans who feel

besieged. Increasingly barricaded, mistrustful of their neighbors, they've

sacrificed virtue to fear.

<blockquote>
	
	<font size=5>A</font>MERICANS today have plenty of reasons to be thankful that they were not
Americans a hundred years ago, but they also have more than a few reasons
to wish they had been. On the one hand, a hundred years ago there was no Voting
Rights Act, no penicillin, and no zipper, and the first daily comic strip was
still more than a decade away. On the other hand, there was no income tax, no
nuclear bomb, and no Maury Povich. Also on the plus side, the average American
a hundred years ago was able to sleep 20 percent longer than the average
American today.<p>

That last figure, supported by various historical studies over the years, comes
from a report released by the Better Sleep Council. Americans in the late 1800s
are believed to have slept an average of about nine and a half hours a night.
The average today is about seven and a half hours. A survey by the Better Sleep
Council reveals that on a typical weeknight almost 60 percent of Americans get
<i>less</i> than seven hours of sleep. Other evidence seems to indicate that
the rate of sleep loss is in fact accelerating. <p>

Some may argue that the Better Sleep Council's news should be discounted, on
the grounds that the council has an interest in the story--it is supported
(comfortably?) by the mattress industry. <p>

I would counter that the data simply confirm what anecdotal evidence already
suggests is true. Independent experts at universities and hospitals speak as
one on the subject, observing that as a nation we are laboring under a large
and increasingly burdensome "sleep deficit," defined as the difference between
how much sleep we need and how much we get. <p>

Would that we could pass this particular deficit on to our children! But the
only way we can pay it back, the experts say, is by getting more sleep
ourselves. Apparently, we're trying. A recent article in <i>The Wall Street
Journal</i> took note of the growing phenomenon of employees napping at work,
but I suspect that this barely covers the interest payments, which go right to
Japan. (As you may have noticed, the Japanese are asleep most of the time that
we're awake.) <p>

Why, by degrees, are we banishing sleep? In a handful of instances, arguably,
the cause has been government overregulation. I am thinking of the recent case
of Sari Zayed, of Davis, California. Ms. Zayed, after being overheard by a
neighbor, was awakened at 1:30 A.M. by a municipal "noise-abatement officer"
who gave her a $50 citation for snoring too loudly. The amount of money that
Ms. Zayed subsequently received in damages from the city of Davis would allow
her to pay for nightly snoring citations from now to the end of the year.<p>

America's sleep deficit, though, is surely a systemic phenomenon. Many
commentators would blame it on what might be called the AWOL factor--that is,
the American Way of Life. We are by nature a busy and ambitious people whom
tectonic social forces--declining average wage, high rate of divorce,
two-paycheck families, instant telecommunications, jet travel across time
zones, growing popularity of soccer for everyone older than four--have turned
into a race of laboratory rats on a treadmill going nowhere ever faster. And
there is obviously something to this explanation. It is noteworthy that
television shows like <i>Seinfeld</i> and <i>Cheers</i>, on which nobody seems
to have any real responsibilities (circumstances that accord more fully with
most viewers' fantasies than with their actual lives), have come to constitute
a distinct broadcast genre known as "time porn."<p>


<CENTER>
*    *    *<p>
</CENTER>

It is hard not to credit the importance of the AWOL factor, but I wonder if the
driving force behind the sleep deficit is in fact more pervasive, and indeed
global in nature: the triumph of light. I am by no means a romantic or a
Luddite when it comes to electricity (anyone who is should read Robert Caro's
<i>The Years of Lyndon Johnson</i> for its haunting description of life in west
Texas in the days before rural electrification), and I also don't subscribe to
the fashionable opinion that electronic labor-saving devices (personal
computers possibly excepted) end up consuming more labor than they save. Yet
electricity's ubiquitous and seemingly most innocuous use--to power the common
light bulb--could not help exacting a price in sleep. Electricity made it
possible for the first time in history for masses of humanity to vanquish
darkness. <p>

I had never given much thought to the role of darkness in ordinary human
affairs until I read a monograph prepared by John Staudenmaier, a historian of
technology and a Jesuit priest, for a recent conference at MIT. (The essay will
appear in a book called <i>The Idea of Progress Revisited</i>, edited by Leo
Marx and Bruce Mazlish.) Staudenmaier makes the point--obvious when brought up,
though we've mostly lost sight of it--that from the time of the hominid Lucy,
in Hadar, Ethiopia, to the time of Thomas Edison, in West Orange, New Jersey,
the onset of darkness sharply curtailed most kinds of activity for most of our
ancestors. He writes,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Living with electric lights makes it difficult to retrieve the experience of a
non-electrified society. For all but the very wealthy, who could afford
exorbitant arrays of expensive artificial lights, nightfall brought the works
of daytime to a definitive end. Activities that need good light--where sharp tools are
wielded or sharply defined boundaries maintained; purposeful activities
designed to achieve specific goals; in short, that which we call work--all this
subsided in the dim light of evening. Absent the press of work, people
typically took themselves safely to home and were left with time in the evening
for less urgent and more sensual matters: storytelling, sex, prayer, sleep,
dreaming.<p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Staudenmaier's comments on electric light occupy only a few passages. His
larger subject is Western intellectual history, and how metaphors of
"enlightenment" came to be associated with orderliness, objectivity, and
progress, even as metaphors of darkness came to signify the chaotic, the
nonrational, the terrifying. He argues that we have lost, to our detriment, the
medieval view that some aspects of life and understanding are not necessarily
helped by clarity or harmed by ambiguity. Observing that Enlightenment ideals
have "taken a fair beating" in the course of this century, Staudenmaier wonders
if it is time to rediscover the metaphysical dark, that place "where visions
are born and human purpose renewed."<p>

I'll leave that thought where it is. But the implication of electricity in the
sleep deficit seems hard to argue with. Whatever it is that we wish or are made
to do--pursue leisure, earn a living--there are simply far more usable hours
now in which to do it. Darkness was once an ocean into which our capacity to
venture was greatly limited; now we are wresting vast areas of permanent
lightness from the darkness, much the way the Dutch have wrested polders of dry
land from the sea. So vast are these areas that in composite satellite
photographs of the world at night the contours of civilization are clearly
illuminated--the boundaries of continents, the metastases of cities. Even
Wrigley Field, once a reliable pool of nocturnal darkness, would now show up
seventeen nights during the baseball season. In the United States at midnight
more than five million people are at work at full-time jobs. Supermarkets, gas
stations, copy shops--many of these never close. I know of a dentist in Ohio
who decided to open an all-night clinic, and has had the last laugh on friends
who believed that he would never get patients. The supply-side theory may not
have worked in economics, but it has certainly worked with regard to light: the
more we get, the more we find ways to put it to use. And, of course, the more
we get, the more we distance ourselves from the basic diurnal rhythm in which
our evolution occurred. <p>

<CENTER>
*   *   *<p>
</CENTER>

Thomas Edison, famous for subsisting on catnaps, would have wanted it this way.
In contrast, Calvin Coolidge, a younger man with an older temperament, slept at
least ten and often as much as eleven hours a day. Two world views collide
here, and somewhere between them is a balance waiting to be struck. Where and
how? The only useful contribution I can make is to recall life in Ireland in
the mid-1960s. One of the elements that made it so congenial was a shared
expertise among engineers at the Electricity Supply Board which resulted in
regular but unpredictably occurring blackouts. The relentless march of time
would suddenly be punctuated by a limbo of uncertain duration. Lights were
extinguished. Clocks stopped. Television screens went black. Drivers became
hesitant and generous at traffic signals. Society and all its components took a
blessed time out. <p>

There was also something in Ireland called "holy hour," a period in the
afternoon when all the pubs would close. Perhaps what Americans need is a holy
hour in the form of a blackout--a brief caesura in our way of life that might
come every day at perhaps nine-thirty or ten at night. Not the least of the
holy hour's benefits, I might add, would be an appealing new time slot for
Maury Povich.

			NCE you slip past that nurses' station in the east 

wing of D-3, you can get into the library at night easy enough if you have the

keys. They keep the phone locked up in a desk drawer there but if you have the

keys you can get it out and make all the long-distance calls you want to for

free, and smoke all the cigarettes you want to, as long as you open a window

and don't let the smoke pile up so thick inside that it sets off the smoke

alarm. You don't want to set that thing to chirping. The library is a small

room. There are three walls of paperback westerns and one wall of windows and

one desk. </font> <p> 

		

		I called up Neap down in Orange, Texas, and he said, "I live in a bog now." I

hadn't seen him in forty-odd years and I woke him up in the middle of the night

and that was the first thing out of his mouth. "My house is sinking. I live in

a bog now." I told him I had been thinking about the Fox Company Raid and

thought I would give him a ring. We called it the Fox Company Raid, but it

wasn't a company raid or even a platoon raid, it was just a squad of us, with

three or four extra guys carrying pump shotguns for trench work. Neap said he

didn't remember me. Then he said he did remember me, but not very well. He

said, "I don't talk service no more."<p>



We had been in reserve and had gone back up on the line to relieve some kind of

pacifist division. Those boys had something like "Live and Let Live" on their

shoulder patches. When they went out on patrol at night, they faked it. They

would go out about a hundred yards and lie down in the paddies, and doze off,

too, like some of the night nurses on D-3. When they came back, they would say

they had been all the way over to the Chinese outposts but had failed to engage

the enemy. They failed night after night. Right behind the line the mortar guys

sat around in their mortar pits and played cards all day. I don't believe they

even had aiming stakes set up around their pits. They hated to fire those tubes

because the Chinese would fire right back.<p>



It was a different story when we took over. The first thing we did was go all

the way over to the Chinese main line. On the first dark night we left our

trenches and crossed the paddies and slipped past their outposts and went up

the mountainside and crawled into their trench line before they knew what was

up. We shot up the place pretty good and blew two bunkers, or tried to, and got

out of there fast with three live prisoners. One was a young officer. Those

trenches had a sour smell. There was a lot of noise. The Chinese fired off

yellow flares and red flares, and they hollered and sprayed pistol bullets with

their burp guns and threw those wooden potato-masher grenades with the

cast-iron heads. The air was damp and some of them didn't go off. Their fuses

weren't very good. Their grenade fuses would sputter and go out. We were in and

out of there before they knew what had hit them. It could happen to anybody.

They were good soldiers and just happened to get caught by surprise, by sixteen

boys from Fox Company. You think of Chinese soldiers as boiling all around you

like fire ants, but once you get into their trench line, not even the Chinese

army can put up a front wider than one man.<p>

<blockquote>

Neap said, "I don't talk service no more," but he didn't hang up on me.

Sometimes they do, it being so late at night when I call. Mostly they're glad

to hear from me and we'll sit in the dark and talk service for a long time. I

sit here in the dark at the library desk smoking my Camels and I think they sit

in the dark too, on the edges of their beds with their bare feet on the

floor.<p>



I told Neap service was the only thing I did talk, and that I had the keys now

and was talking service coast to coast every night. He said his house was in

bad shape. His wife had something wrong with her too. I didn't care about that

stuff. His wife wasn't on the Fox Company Raid. I didn't care whether his house

was level or not but you like to be polite and I asked him if his house was

sinking even all around. He said no, it was settling bad at the back, to where

they couldn't get through the back door, and the front was all lifted up in the

air, to where they had to use a little stepladder to get up on their front

porch.<p>



You were supposed to get a week of meritorious R and R in Hong Kong if you

brought in a live prisoner. We dragged three live prisoners all the way back

from the Chinese main line of resistance and one was an officer and I never got

one day of R and R in Hong Kong. Sergeant Zim was the only one who ever did get

it that I know of. On the regular kind of R and R you went to Kyoto, which was

all right, but it wasn't meritorious R and R. I asked Neap if he knew of anyone

besides Zim who got meritorious R and R in Hong Kong. He said he didn't even

know Zim got it.<p>



He asked me if I was in a nut ward. I asked him how many guys he could name who

went on the Fox Company Raid, not counting him and me and Zim. All he could

come up with was Dill, Vick, Bogue, Ball, and Sipe. I gave him eight more names

real fast, and the towns and states they came from. "Now who's the nut? Who's

soft in the head now, Neap? Who knows more about the Fox Company Raid, you or

me?" I didn't say that to him because you try to be polite when you can. I

didn't have to say it. You could tell I had rattled him pretty good, the way I

whipped off all those names.<p>



He asked me how much disability money I was drawing down. I told him and he

said it was a hell of a note that guys in the nut ward were drawing down more

money than he was on Social Security. I told him Dill was dead, and Gott. He

said yeah, but Dill was on Okinawa in 1945, in the other war, and was older

than us. He told me a little story about Dill. I had heard it before. Dill was

talking to the captain outside the command-post bunker, telling him about the

time on Okinawa he had guided a flamethrower tank across open ground, to burn a

Jap field gun out of a cave. Dill said, "They was a whole bunch of far come out

of that thang in a hurry, Skipper." Neap laughed over the phone. He said, "I

still laugh every time I think about that. 'They was a whoooole bunch of far

come out of that thang in a hurry, Skipper.' The way he said it, you know,

Dill."<p>



Neap thought I must be having a lot of trouble tracking people down. I haven't

had any trouble to speak of. Except for me and Foy and Rust, who are far from

home, and Sipe, who is a fugitive from justice, everybody else went back home

and stayed there. They left home just that one time. Neap was surprised to hear

that Sipe was on the lam, at his age. How fast could Sipe be moving these days,

at his age? Neap said it was Dill and Sipe who grabbed those prisoners and that

Zim had nothing to do with it. I told him Zim had something to do with getting

us over there and back. He said yeah, Zim was all right, but he didn't do no

more in that stinking trench line than we did, and so how come he got

meritorious R and R in Hong Kong and we didn't? I couldn't answer that

question. I can't find anyone who knows the answer to that. I told him I hadn't

called up Zim yet, over in Niles, Michigan. I wanted to have the squad pretty

much accounted for before I made my report to him. Neap said, "Tell Zim I'm

living on a mud flat." I told him he was the last one I had to call up before

Zim. I put Neap at the bottom of my list because I couldn't remember much about

him.<p>



I can still see the faces of those boys who went on the Fox Company Raid,

except that Neap's face is not very clear to me. It drifts just out of range.

He said he could feel his house going down while we were talking there on the

phone. He said his house was going down fast now, and with him and his wife in

it. It sounded to me like the Neaps were going all the way down. <p>



He asked me how it was here. He wanted to know how it was in this place and I

told him it wasn't so bad. It's not so bad here if you have the keys. For a

long time I didn't have the keys.<p>

	<font size=5>I</font>n 1842 literature and science met with a thud. Alfred Tennyson had just

published his poem "The Vision of Sin." Among the appreciative letters he

received was one from Charles Babbage, the mathematician and inventor who is

known today as the father of the computer. Babbage wrote to suggest a

correction to Tennyson's "otherwise beautiful" poem--in particular to the lines

"Every moment dies a man, /Every moment one is born."<p>



<p>



"It must be manifest," Babbage pointed out, "that, were this true, the

population of the world would be at a standstill." Since the population was in

fact growing slightly, Babbage continued, "I would suggest that in the next

edition of your poem you have it read: 'Every moment dies a man,/Every moment

1-1/16 is born.'" Even this was not strictly correct, Babbage conceded, "but I

believe 1-1/16 will be sufficiently accurate for poetry."<p>



<p>



Today computers are standard tools for amateur and professional literary

investigators alike. Shakespeare is both the most celebrated object of this

effort and the most common. At Claremont McKenna College, in California, for

example, two highly regarded faculty members have devoted years of their lives

to a computer-based attempt to find out whether Shakespeare, rather than

Francis Bacon or the Earl of Oxford or any of a myriad of others, wrote the

plays and poems we associate with his name.<p>



<p>



As Babbage's venture into criticism foreshadowed, the marriage of computers and

literature has been an uneasy one. At the mention of computers or statistics,

many Shakespeareans and others in the literary establishment wrinkle their

noses in distaste. To approach the glories of literature in this plodding way

is misguided, they say, and misses the point in the same way as does the

oft-cited remark that the human body is worth just a few dollars--the market

value of the various chemicals of which it is composed. "This is just madness,"

says Ricardo Quinones, the chairman of the literature department at Claremont

McKenna. "Why don't they simply read the plays?"<p>



<p>



Rather than read, these literary sleuths prefer to count. Their strategy is

straightforward. Most are in search of a statistical fingerprint, a reliable

and objective mark of identity unique to a given author. Every writer will

sooner or later reveal himself, they contend, by quirks of style that may be

too subtle for the eye to note but are well within the computer's power to

identify.<p>



<p>



For a University of Chicago statistician named Ronald Thisted, the call to

enter this quasi-literary enterprise came on a Sunday morning in December of

1985. Thisted had settled down with The New York Times Book Review and an

article by Gary Taylor, a Shakespeare scholar, caught his eye. Taylor claimed

that he had found a new poem by Shakespeare at Oxford's Bodleian Library. Among

the many reasons Taylor advanced for believing in the authenticity of the poem,

called "Shall I Die?," Thisted focused on one. "One of his arguments," Thisted

says, "was that several words in the poem don't appear previously in

Shakespeare. And that was evidence that Shakespeare wrote it. One's first

reaction is, that's dumb. If Shakespeare didn't use these words, why would that

be evidence that he wrote the poem?" But Taylor's article went on to explain

that in practically everything he wrote, Shakespeare used words he hadn't used

elsewhere. Thisted conceded the point in his own mind, but raised another

objection. "If ALL the words in there were ones that Shakespeare had never

used," he thought, "if it were in Sanskrit or something, you'd say, 'No way

Shakespeare could have written this.' So there had to be about the right number

of new words." That question--how many new words an authentic Shakespeare text

should contain--was similar to one that Thisted himself had taken on a decade

before. Together with the Stanford statistician Bradley Efron, then his

graduate adviser, Thisted had published a paper that proposed a precise answer

to the question "How many words did Shakespeare know but never use?" The

question sounds ludicrous, like "How many New Year's resolutions have I not yet

made?" Nonetheless, Efron and Thisted managed to answer it. They found the

crucial insight in a generation-old story, perhaps apocryphal, about an

encounter between a mathematician and a butterfly collector.<p>



<p>



R. A. Fisher, the statistical guru of his day, had been consulted by a

butterfly hunter newly back from Malaysia. The naturalist had caught members of

some species once or twice, other species several times, and some species time

and time again. Was it worth the expense, the butterfly collector asked, to go

back to Malaysia for another season's trapping? Fisher recast the question as a

mathematical problem. The collector knew how many species he had seen exactly

once, exactly twice, and so on. Now, how many species were out there that he

had yet to see? If the collector had many butterflies from each species he had

seen, Fisher reasoned, then quite likely he had sampled all the species that

were out there. Another hunting trip would be superfluous. But if he had only

one or two representatives of most species, then there might be many species

yet to find. It would be worth returning to Malaysia. Fisher devised a

mathematical way to make that rough idea precise (and reportedly suggested

another collecting trip). Efron and Thisted's question was essentially the

same.<p>



<p>



Where the naturalist had tramped through the rain forest in search of exotic

butterflies, the mathematicians could scan Shakespeare in search of unusual

words. By counting how many words he used exactly once, exactly twice, and so

on, they would attempt to calculate how many words he knew but had yet to

use.<p>



<p>



Neither Efron nor Thisted had imagined that their statistical sleight of hand

could ever be put to a live test. No new work of Shakespeare's had been

unearthed for decades. Now Taylor had given them their chance. A new

Shakespeare poem, like a new butterfly-collecting trip to the jungle, should

yield a certain number of new words, a certain number that Shakespeare had used

once before, and so on. If Shakespeare did write "Shall I Die?," which has 429

words, according to the mathematicians' calculations it should have about seven

words he never used elsewhere; it has nine. To Efron and Thisted's surprise,

the number of words in the poem which Shakespeare had used once before also

came close to matching their predictions, as did the number of twice-used

words, all the way through to words he had used ninety-nine times before. The

poem, which sounds nothing like Shakespeare, fit Shakespeare like a glove.<p>



<p>



This is work that can suck up lives. One Defoe scholar, trying to pick out true

Defoe from a slew of anonymous and pseudonymous works, has pursued his quarry

for twenty years, with no end in sight. A team trying to determine if the Book

of Mormon was composed by ancient authors or by the nineteenth-century American

Joseph Smith took 10,000 hours to produce a single essay. (The largely Mormon

team of researchers concluded that Smith had not written the Book of Mormon.

Confirmed samples of Smith's prose, the researchers argued, showed patterns of

word usage different from those in the Book of Mormon.) Paper after paper

begins with a trumpet fanfare and ends with a plaintive bleat. One writer, for

instance, decided to determine whether Jonathan Swift or one of his

contemporaries had written a particular article, by pigeonholing his words

according to what part of speech they were. "The only positive conclusion from

over a year of effort and the coding of over 40,000 words," she lamented, "is

that a great deal of further study will be needed." (Swift himself had

satirized, in Gulliver's Travels, a professor who had "employed all his

Thoughts from his Youth" in making "the strictest Computation of the general

Proportion there is in Books between the Numbers of Particles, Nouns, and

Verbs, and other Parts of Speech.")<p>



<p>



Despite the shortage of triumphs the field is growing, because more and more of

the work can be assigned to electronic drudges. Scholars once had to count

words by hand. Later they had the option of typing entire books into a

computer, so that the machine could do the counting. Today computers are

everywhere, and whole libraries of machine-readable texts are available.

Software to do deluxe slicing and dicing is easy to obtain.<p>



<p>



As a result, everything imaginable is being counted somewhere. Someone at this

moment is tallying up commas or meticulously computing adjective-to-adverb

ratios. But sophisticated tools don't automatically produce good work. A future

Academy of Statistics and Style might take as its motto the warning that the

Nobel laureate P. B. Medawar issued to his fellow scientists: "An experiment

not worth doing is not worth doing well."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Among those least likely to be fazed by such pronouncements is a professor of

political science at Claremont McKenna College named Ward Elliott. Elliott is

an authority on voting rights, a cheerful eccentric, and, like his father

before him, inclined to view the Earl of Oxford as the true author of

Shakespeare's works. Four years ago Elliott recruited Robert Valenza, an expert

programmer also on the Claremont McKenna faculty, and the two set to work on

the authorship question.<p>



<p>



This time the model would be not butterfly hunting but radar. Valenza had spent

considerable time devising mathematical procedures to find the patterns

obscured by noisy and jumbled electronic signals. Adapted to Shakespeare, the

idea was to go beyond counting various words, as many others had done, and see

whether consistent patterns could be found in the way certain key words were

used together. Two writers might use the words "blue" and "green" equally often

throughout a text, for example, but the writers could be distinguished if one

always used them on the same page while the other never used them together.<p>



<p>



This pattern-finding mathematics is widely used in physics and engineering, in

deciphering television and radar signals, for example. Given a long list of

words--not simply the "blue" and "green" of the example, but dozens more--the

computer can quickly tell how Shakespeare typically balanced those words. "You

might have a pattern," Valenza says, "with a lot of 'love,' very little 'hate,'

and a good deal of 'woe.'" A different writer might use the same words, and

even use them at the same rates as Shakespeare, but the configurations might be

different. The result is that a given list of words produces a kind of

voiceprint for each author.<p>



<p>



Valenza and Elliott examined "common but not too common" words that Shakespeare

used. To examine rare words, Valenza had reasoned, would be like trying to

identify a voice from a whisper, and to examine common words would be to let

the writer shout into your ear. The final, fifty-two-word list--with such

miscellaneous entries as "about," "death," "desire," "secret," and "set"--was

assembled by trial and error. It consisted of words with two key properties. In

various works of Shakespeare's those words are used in patterns that yield the

same voiceprint each time. And when other writers are tested, the same words

yield voiceprints that are different from Shakespeare's.<p>



<p>



The machinery in place, Valenza and Elliott began by testing Shakespeare's

poetry against that of thirty other writers. Exciting results came quickly: The

disputed "Shall I Die?" poem seemed not to be Shakespeare's after all. Three of

the leading claimants to Shakespeare's work--Francis Bacon, Christopher

Marlowe, and Sir Edward Dyer--were decisively ruled out. To Elliott's

good-humored consternation, the test dealt just as harshly with the claims put

forward on behalf of the Earl of Oxford. Worse was to follow. For even as this

first round of tests ruled out the best-known Shakespeare candidates, it left a

few surprising contenders. One possibility for the "real" Shakespeare: Queen

Elizabeth I. "That did it for our chance of appearing in Science," Elliott

laments, "But it vastly increased our chance of getting into the National

Enquirer." (To his dismay, Elliott did find himself in Science, not as the

co-author of a weighty research paper but as the subject of a skeptical news

brief with the headline "Did Queen Write Shakespeare's Sonnets?")<p>



<p>



Valenza and Elliott have since conducted more-extensive tests that have ruled

out Queen Elizabeth. But the mishap highlights a risk that is shared by all the

number-crunching methods. "If the glass slipper doesn't fit, it's pretty good

evidence that you're not Cinderella," Elliott points out. "But if it does fit,

that doesn't prove that you are."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The risk of being fooled is least for someone who combines a deep knowledge of

literature with some statistical insight. Donald Foster, a professor of English

at Vassar College, fits that bill. Foster's scholarship is highly regarded.

Soon after "Shall I Die?" was presented to the world, for example, he wrote a

long debunking essay that persuaded many readers that the poem was not

Shakespeare's. In a more recent essay he consigned whole libraries of research

to the scrap heap. Hundreds or thousands of articles have been written to

explain the epigraph to Shake-speare's Sonnets, which begins, "To the onlie

begetter of these insuing sonnets, Master W.H." Who was W.H.? Foster's solution

to the mystery, which won him the Modern Language Association's Parker Prize,

is that W.H. was...a typo. The publisher, who wrote the epigraph as a bit of

flowery praise to honor Shakespeare, had intended to print "W.SH."<p>



<p>



Those essays had nothing to do with statistics, but Foster has done some

statistical sleuthing of his own, and he is well aware of the hazards. One

scholar compared Shakespeare's plays with someone else's poems, for example,

and concluded that Shakespeare used the present tense more than other writers

do. Another compared Shakespeare with later writers and concluded that he used

many four-letter words, whereas other writers used shorter words--forgetting

that archaic words like "thou" and "hath" drive Shakespeare's average up.

"There are strong and compelling reasons for avoiding this kind of research,"

Foster says, "because it's so difficult to anticipate all the pitfalls." But

Foster himself has often given way to temptation. Like many Shakespeareans, he

steers clear of the "authorship question," but he has looked into a pertinent

mystery.<p>



<p>



Shakespeare acted in his plays. But with two exceptions, we don't know what

roles he took. Foster believes he has found a statistical way to gather that

long-vanished knowledge. "It occurred to me," he says, "that Shakespeare may

have been influenced in his writing by the parts he had memorized for

performances and was reciting on a more or less daily basis." Last year Foster

figured out a way to test that hunch. "The results," he says, "have been

absolutely stunning."<p>



<p>



"We started by using a concordance to type in all the words that Shakespeare

used ten times or fewer," Foster says. These aren't exotic words, necessarily,

just ones that don't crop up often in Shakespeare. Scholars have known for some

time that these "rare" words tend to be clustered chronologically. Foster found

that if two plays shared a considerable number of rare words, in the later play

those words were scattered randomly among all the characters. In the earlier

play, the shared words were not scattered. "In one role," Foster says, "there

would be two to six times the expected number of rare words." There stood

Shakespeare: the words that Shakespeare the writer had at the tip of his pen

were the ones he had been reciting as Shakespeare the actor.<p>



<p>



If Foster is right, Shakespeare played Theseus in A Midsummer Nights Dream and

"Chorus" in Henry V and Romeo and Juliet. In play after play the first

character to come on stage and speak is the one that Foster's test identifies

as Shakespeare: John Gower in Pericles, Bedford in Henry VI, Part I, Suffolk in

Henry VI, Part II, and Warwick in Henry VI, Part III. And Foster's test picks

out as Shakespeare's the two roles that we have seventeenth-century evidence he

played: the ghost in Hamlet and Adam in As You Like It.<p>



<p>



The theory can be tested in other ways. It never assigns to Shakespeare a role

we know another actor took. The roles it does label as Shakespeare's all seem

plausible--male characters rather than women or children. The test never runs

in the wrong direction, with the unusual words scattered randomly in an early

play and clustered in one role in a later play. On those occasions when

Foster's test indicates that Shakespeare played TWO roles in a given

play--Gaunt and a gardener in Richard II, for example--the characters are never

onstage together. Foster's theory passes another test. When Foster looks at the

rare words that Hamlet shares with Macbeth, written a few years later, those

words point to the ghost in Hamlet as Shakespeare's role. And if Foster looks

at rare words that Hamlet shares with a different play also written a few years

later--King Lear, for example--those shared words also pick out the ghost as

Shakespeare's role.<p>



<p>



Additional evidence has been uncovered. After Hamlet, the ghost's vocabulary

exerted a strong influence on Shakespeare's writing and then tapered off. But

Shakespeare's plays went in and out of production. When Hamlet was revived

several years after its first staging, and Shakespeare was again playing the

ghost, he began again to recycle the ghost's vocabulary.<p>



<p>



It is a strange image, a computer fingering a ghost. But it is a sign of things

to come. Eventually the prejudice against computers in literary studies will

give way. "The walls are sure to crumble," Ward Elliott says, "just as they did

in baseball and popular music....Some high-tech Jackie Robinson will score a

lot of runs, and thereafter all the teams in the league will pursue the newest

touch as ardently and piously as they now shrink from it."

<blockquote>



	

	<font size=5>R</font>ACE is no longer a straightforward, morally unambiguous force in American

politics; instead, considerations of race are now deeply imbedded in the

strategy and tactics of politics, in competing concepts of the function and

responsibility of government, and in each voter's conceptual structure of moral

and partisan identity. Race helps define liberal and conservative ideologies,

shapes the presidential coalitions of the Democratic and Republican parties,

provides a harsh new dimension to concern over taxes and crime, drives a wedge

through alliances of the working classes and the poor, and gives both momentum

and vitality to the drive to establish a national majority inclined by income

and demography to support policies benefiting the affluent and the upper-middle

class. In terms of policy, race has played a critical role in the creation of a

political system that has tolerated, if not supported, the growth of the

disparity between rich and poor over the past fifteen years. Race-coded images

and language changed the course of the 1980, 1984, and 1988 presidential

elections and the 1990 elections for the governorships of California and

Alabama, the U.S. Senate in North Carolina, and the post of Texas secretary of

agriculture. The political role of race is subtle and complex, requiring

listening to those whose views are deeply repellent to some and deeply resonant

for others. The debate over racial policy has been skewed and distorted by a

profound failure to listen.<p>



"You could classify me as a working-class Democrat, a card-carrying union

member," says Dan Donahue, a Chicago carpenter who became active in the

campaign of a Republican state senator in 1988. "I'm not a card-carrying

Republican--yet. We have four or five generations of welfare mothers. And they

[Democrats] say the answer to that is we need more programs. Come on. It's well

and good we should have compassion for these people, but your compassion goes

only so far. I don't mind helping, but somebody has got to help themselves,

you've got to pull. When you try to pick somebody up, they have to help.

Unfortunately, most of the people who need help in this situation are black and

most of the people who are doing the helping are white. We [white Cook County

voters] are tired of paying for the Chicago Housing Authority, and for public

housing and public transportation that we don't use. They [taxpayers] hate it

[the school-board tax] because they are paying for black schools that aren't

even educating kids, and the money is just going into the Board of Education

and the teachers' union."<p>



Moderate-income voters like Donahue pose a central dilemma for the Democratic

Party. They are essential if the party is to have an economically coherent

base, and if the party is legitimately to claim to represent not only the poor

but also the average working man and woman. These voters have, however, been

caught up in an explosive chain reaction of race, rights, values, and taxes

which has propelled significant percentages of them out of the Democratic Party

in presidential elections and into the "unreliable" column in state and local

contests. Racism and racial prejudice fail to explain such voter defection

adequately, and Democratic liberals' reliance on charges of racism guarantees

political defeat and, more important, guarantees continued ignorance of the

dynamics at the core of presidential politics.<p>

<p>





THE COSTS OF LIBERALISM<p>



<font size=5>T</font>he past two decades have seen a significant enlargement of the ideological and

value-based underpinnings of political conservatism and, to a large extent, of

the Republican Party. Race, rights, and taxes have become key forces behind

this enlargement, helping to bring about a new polarization of the electorate,

a polarization that has effectively replaced the New Deal coalition structure

of presidential contests.<p>



This polarization is built on mutually reinforcing divisions of the electorate:

taxpayers against tax recipients; those who emphasize responsibility against

those who emphasize rights; proponents of deregulation and an unfettered free

market against supporters of the regulatory state and of policies protecting or

advancing the interests of specific groups; and, finally, whites against

blacks. Public policies backed by liberals have driven these new alignments. In

particular, busing, affirmative action, and much of the rights revolution in

behalf of criminal defendants, prisoners, homosexuals, welfare recipients, and

a host of other previously marginalized groups have, for many voters, converted

the government from ally to adversary. The simultaneous increase, over the past

two and a half decades, in crime, welfare dependency, illegitimacy, and

educational failure have established in the minds of many voters a numbing

array of "costs"--perceived and real--of liberalism.<p>



Major elements of the Republican Party have exploited and inflated the costs of

liberal policies. Republican strategists and ideologues have furthermore

capitalized on these costs to establish a new and evolving ideology:

conservative egalitarianism, opposed to special preferences whether for blacks,

unions, or any other liberal interest. Liberal Democratic support for

preferential hiring on the shop floor and in the schoolroom--to make up for

past discrimination--has enabled a conservative Republican Party to lay claim

to the cause of equal opportunity, once the rallying cry of the civil-rights

movement. In the wake of sustained group and individual conflicts over rights,

preferences, and government benefits, an egalitarian populism of the right has

emerged, one so strong that it was not only accessible to George C. Wallace in

1968 but remained available twenty years later to a scion of the old guard of

the Northeast, George Herbert Walker Bush. Conservative populism has permitted

the Republican Party to replace in the minds of many voters the idea of an

"establishment" ruled by business interests with a hated new liberal

establishment, adversarial to the common man: an elite--of judges, bureaucrats,

newspaper editors, ACLU lawyers, academics, Democratic politicians,

civil-rights and feminist leaders--determined to enact racially and socially

redistributive policies demanding the largest sacrifices from the white working

and lower-middle classes.<p>



This new polarization drives a wedge right through the heart of the old

Democratic presidential coalition, and threatens to undermine the genuine

advances in racial equality which have occurred in the years since the passage

of the l964 Civil Rights Act. Race relations in America are, in fact, moving on

two tracks. On one there has been an extraordinary integration of the races, a

striking expansion of the black middle class, and a powerful contribution from

blacks to the mainstream culture. American society is undergoing a

transformation that may ultimately destroy many of the racial stereotypes that

drive prejudice. In the years before the outbreak of the Second World War, 73

percent of all black college graduates became ministers or teachers, almost all

serving exclusively black constituencies. In 1940 only 187,520 blacks held

white-collar jobs, and over 100,000 of them were clergymen, teachers, or the

owners of generally small, ghetto-based retail stores producing marginal

incomes. By 1990, 1.91 million blacks held managerial and professional jobs.

From 1950 to 1990 the black population doubled but the number of blacks holding

white-collar jobs increased by 920 percent.<p>



On the second track, racial progress has run into major roadblocks: crime,

welfare dependency, illegitimacy, drug abuse, and a

generation--disproportionately black--of young men and women unwilling either

to stay in school or to take on menial labor, a group that has collided with a

restructuring of the American economy and a dramatic loss of well-paid

entry-level jobs. The worsening of the symptoms of social dysfunction over the

past three decades has become a driving force in politics, for the symptoms are

perceived as an unacceptable cost of liberalism not only in the neighborhoods

of southwest Chicago but also, increasingly, in the more affluent sections of

suburbia and in the business cores of cities.<p>

<p>



A NEW LEASE ON PREJUDICE<p>



<font size=5>L</font>iberal elites have had major difficulty recognizing the costs both of racial

conflict and of the broader rights revolution in behalf of groups as diverse as

women, the mentally disabled, prison inmates, and immigrants from developing

countries. Liberal elites have in addition disregarded the effects of

burdensome taxes on working-class and middle-class voters, who may see

themselves as being forced to finance a revolution challenging their own values

and often undermining their hard-won security. Democratic liberalism has shown

a consistent reluctance to confront the inherent distributional conflicts

imbedded in liberal policies. After the 1984 election the Democratic National

Committee commissioned a $250,000 voter study by CRG Communications, only to

quash its release because it made explicit controversial sources of dissent

from liberal orthodoxy. The study, drawn from a poll of 5,000 voters and

thirty-three focus groups, found that Democratic defectors among white urban

ethnics and white southern moderates believed that <p>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

the Democratic Party has not stood with them as they moved from the

working to the middle class. They have a whole set of middle-class economic

problems today, and their party is not helping them. Instead it is helping the

blacks, Hispanics and the poor. They feel betrayed....[These voters] view gays

and feminists as outside the orbit of acceptable social life. These groups

represent, in their view, a social underclass....[White urban ethnics] feel

threatened by an economic underclass that absorbs their taxes and even locks

them out of the job, in the case of affirmative action. They also fear a social

underclass that threatens to violate or corrupt their children. It is these

underclasses that signify their present image of the Democratic Party....The

Democrats are the giveaway party. Giveaway means too much middle-class money

going to blacks and the poor.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





In some communities, such as the white working-class suburbs of Detroit,

positive assessments of the Democratic Party have been washed out altogether by

anger and discontent that are open, unabashed, and extremely harsh. Voters from

such communities have been crucial to the outcome of presidential elections for

the past two decades--they are the silent majority of the 1970s and the Reagan

Democrats of the 1980s. Their votes expanded the Republican coalition to

produce election-year majorities, and their abandonment of the Democratic Party

in presidential elections undermined the coalition of the have-nots and

affirmed the ascendancy of a coalition of the haves, as disaffected

moderate-income white voters joined forces with traditional Republicans. The

views of working-class defectors from the Democratic Party were examined in a

1985 study of suburban Detroit by Stanley Greenberg, the president of the

Analysis Group, a Democratic polling firm. The study found that<p>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

these white Democratic defectors express a profound distaste for blacks,

a sentiment that pervades almost everything they think about government and

politics. Blacks constitute the explanation for their [white defectors']

vulnerability and for almost everything that has gone wrong in their lives; not

being black is what constitutes being middle class; not living with blacks is

what makes a neighborhood a decent place to live....These sentiments have

important implications for Democrats, as virtually all progressive symbols and

themes have been redefined in racial and pejorative terms....<p>



The special status of blacks is perceived by almost all of these

individuals as a serious obstacle to their personal advancement. Indeed,

discrimination against whites has become a well-assimilated and ready

explanation for their status, vulnerability and failures.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





The bitterness and anger of the white Detroit voters is one consequence of a

central tragedy of the past twenty-five years: the drive to achieve racial

equality and the striking advances of the black middle class have coincided

with a significant worsening of social dysfunction in the bottom third of the

black community. Social dysfunction--crime, welfare dependency, joblessness,

and illegitimacy--wreaks havoc, crushing recognition of the achievements of

liberalism. When it is disproportionately associated with one group or race,

social dysfunction assaults efforts to eliminate prejudice. Gordon W. Allport

wrote in The Nature of Prejudice,<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

Prejudice...may be reduced by equal status contact between majority and

minority groups in the pursuit of common goals. The effect is greatly enhanced

if this contact is sanctioned by institutional supports...and provided it is of

the sort that leads to the perception of common interests and common humanity

between members of the two groups.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





The contact between whites and the black underclass has routinely violated

every standard necessary for the breakdown of racial stereotypes. Most white

contact with the underclass is through personal experience of crime and urban

squalor, through such experience related by friends and family, or through the

daily reports about crime, drugs, and violence which appear on television and

in newspapers. The news includes, as well, periodic reports on out-of-wedlock

births, welfare fraud, drug-related AIDS, crack babies, and inner-city

joblessness.<p>



"The stereotype is not a stereotype anymore," says Kenneth S. Tollett, a black

professor of education at Howard University. "The behavior pattern in the

underclass is not stereotypical in the pejorative sense, but it is a statement

of fact. A stereotype is an overgeneralization, 'This is the way people are,'

and then we say all are like that. The behavior of black males in the

underclass is now beginning to look like the black stereotype. The statements

we have called stereotypes in the past have become true."<p>



Social dysfunction, and crime in particular, have tragically served over the

past two and a half decades to reinforce racial prejudice. Statistics suggest

the widespread problems among the black underclass.<p>



In a nation that is 12 percent black and 84 percent white, there were in 1986,

according to the Department of Justice, more black prison inmates than white or

Hispanic. There were in 1988, according to the Department of Health and Human

Services, more black welfare recipients than white. By the late 1980s,

according to the Bureau of the Census, a majority of black families where

headed by single or separated women. At the same time, according to the

National Center for Health Statistics, more than 60 percent of all black

children were born out of wedlock. Among black male high school dropouts aged

twenty to twenty-four, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the

proportion who had not worked at all during the previous year rose from 15.1

percent in 1974 to a staggering 39.7 percent in 1986. The comparable figures

for young white dropouts were 9.1 percent in 1974 and 11.8 percent in 1986, and

for young Hispanic dropouts 8.8 percent and 9.6 percent. According to figures

compiled by the Department of Justice in criminal-victimization surveys from

1979 to 1986--the surveys considered by law-enforcement professionals to

contain the most reliable data on race--an annual average of 44.3 out of every

1,000 blacks were victims of a violent crime, with much higher rates in very

poor areas, as compared with 34.5 out of every 1,000 whites. At the same time,

however, a far higher percentage of the crimes committed by blacks than of the

crimes committed by whites were interracial. In 1986 and 1987 whites committing

crimes of violence--robbery, rape, and assault--chose white victims 97.5

percent of the time and black victims 2.5 percent of the time in those

incidents in which the victim could identify the race of the offender. Blacks

committing violent crimes chose white victims 51.2 percent of the time and

black victims 48.8 percent of the time. For the specific crime of robbery the

figures are similarly striking. In 1986-1987, of those robberies in which the

race of the offender was identified by the victim, 95.1 percent of robberies

committed by whites had white victims and 4.9 percent had black victims; 57.4

percent of robberies committed by blacks had white victims and 42.6 percent had

black victims.<p>

<p>



THE RACES POLARIZE OVER WHAT'S GONE WRONG<p>



<font size=5>V</font>iolence, joblessness, drug abuse, and family disintegration have not only

functioned to reinforce racial prejudice; they have also led to widely

differing interpretations of what has gone wrong. Significant numbers of

blacks, both middle-class and poor, see malevolent white power behind the

disruption and dislocation in black neighborhoods. Take drug abuse. "It's

almost an accepted fact," says Andrew Cooper, the publisher of the City Sun, a

black weekly Brooklyn newspaper, echoing ideas often heard on black radio talk

shows and in other all-black forums. "It's a deep-seated suspicion. I believe

it. I can't open my desk drawer and say, 'Here it [the evidence] is.' But there

is just too much money in narcotics. People really believe they are being

victimized by The Man. If the government wanted to stop it, it could stop it."

Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, brought an entire

auditorium of black politicians, intellectuals, and organizers--men and women

on the left of the political spectrum, but by no means on the outer fringes--to

their feet during a 1989 speech in New Orleans which clearly captured elements

of a black world view. He said,<p>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

"The black man and woman in America is of no further use to the children of our

former slavemasters and when a thing loses its use or utility, it loses its

value. If your shoes wear out, you don't keep them around; if an old dress

becomes old, you don't keep it around. Once it loses utility, you move to get

rid of it....We cannot accept the fact that they think black people have become

a permanent underclass....If we have become useless in a racist society, then

you must know that not public policy but a covert policy is being already

formulated to get rid of that which is useless, since the economy is going down

and the world is going down. Follow me, brothers and sisters. According to

demographers, if the plummeting birth rate of white people in America

continues, in a few years it will reach zero population growth. As for blacks,

Hispanics, and Native Americans, if their present birth rate continues, by the

year 2080, demographers say, blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans will

conceivably be 50 percent or more of the United States population....If things

continue just birthwise, we could control the Congress, we could control the

Supreme Court, we could control state legislatures, and then 'Run, Jesse, run,'

or 'Run, Jesse Junior, run,' or 'Run, Jesse the Third, run.'"<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



The emergence of predominantly black underclass neighborhoods rife with the

worst symptoms of social pathology has proved to be one of the most disturbing

developments in the United States, both for city residents and for residents of

surrounding areas. In his book Canarsie, the Yale sociologist Jonathan Rieder

described the climate of opinion he found in the late seventies in one of

Brooklyn's white urban ethnic enclaves:<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

Canarsie's image of ghetto culture crystalized out of all the visual gleanings,

fleeting encounters, and racist presumptions. Lower-class blacks lacked

industry, lived for momentary erotic pleasure, and, in their mystique of soul,

glorified the fashions of a high-stepping street life. The hundreds of

thousands of female-headed minority households in New York City, and the

spiraling rate of illegitimate births, reinforced the impression that ghetto

women were immoral....When provincial Jews and Italians recoiled from the riven

families of the ghetto, they were prisoners of ancient notions of right as well

as vituperative passion. "The blacks have ten kids to a family," the Italian

wife of a city worker observed...."Bring up a few, give them love and

education."...It is hard to exaggerate the bewilderment Canarsians felt when

they considered the family patterns of the ghetto. To be without a family in

southern Italy "was to be truly a non-being, un saccu vacante (an empty sack)

as Sicilians say, un nuddu miscatu cu nenti (a nobody mixed with nothing)."<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





THE VALUES BARRIER<p>



<font size=5>T</font>he intensity of public reaction to the world of the underclass has coincided

with a larger conflict in America over values. This conflict has evolved, in

complex ways, from one of the major struggles of the twentieth century: the

struggle between so-called traditional values and a competing set of insurgent

values. Traditional values generally have been seen to revolve around

commitments to the larger community--to the family, to parental responsibility,

to country, to the work ethic, to sexual restraint, to self-control, to rules,

duty, authority, and a stable social order. The competing set of insurgent

values, the focus of rights-oriented political ideologies, of the rights

revolution, and of the civil-rights movement, has been largely concerned with

the rights of the individual--with freedom from oppression, from confinement,

from hierarchy, from authority, from stricture, from repression, from rigid

rule-making, and from the status quo.<p>



On a level essentially ignored by liberal elites--but a level, nonetheless, of

stark reality to key voters--the values debate has become conflated with racial

politics. Among Democrats and liberals the stigmatization of racism in the

1960s had the unintended and paradoxical consequence of stigmatizing the

allegiance of many voters to a whole range of fundamental moral values. In the

late 1960s and early 1970s the raising of the "traditional values" banner over

such issues as law and order, the family, sexual conduct, joblessness, welfare

fraud, and patriotism was seen by liberals and blacks--with some accuracy--as

an appeal to racist, narrow-minded, repressive, or xenophobic instincts,

designed to marshal support for reactionary social policies. The conflation by

the political right of values with attempts to resist racial integration, to

exclude women from public life, and to discredit the extension of

constitutional rights to minorities fueled an often bitter resistance by the

left and by blacks to the whole values package.<p>



The result was that liberal Democrats often barred from consideration what are

in fact legitimate issues for political discourse, issues of fundamental social

and moral concern which must be forthrightly addressed by any national

candidate or party. This stigmatization as "racist" or as "in bad faith" of

open discussion of values-charged-matters--ranging from crime to sexual

responsibility to welfare dependency to drug abuse to standards of social

obligation--has for more than two decades created a VALUES BARRIER between

Democratic liberals and much of the electorate. Insofar as many voters feel

that their cherished policies and practices have been routed, the values

barrier has been a major factor in fracturing a once deeply felt loyalty to a

liberal economic agenda.<p>



When rank-and-file white voters characterize the value structure of the

underclass as aberrant, white liberals are not alone in their angry response.

In segments of the black community the response is often a wounded outrage so

extreme that it precludes all debate.<p>



Bernard Boxill, a black scholar at the University of North Carolina, has, for

example, argued that the growing problems of the underclass may be used by the

white community as "an excuse to undo the legal, social and economic advances

made by the black middle class, plunge the country into a race war, and worst

of all, be a pretext for genocide."<p>



Dr. Frances Welsing, a black psychiatrist, was loudly applauded at a

predominantly black "town meeting" organized and televised in 1989 by ABC-TV

and Ted Koppel when she argued that whites bear responsibility for whatever

disorders there may be in black ghettos:<p>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

"Racism is a behavior system that is organized because white people are a

minority on the planet....If we understand the white fear of genetic

annihilation, which is why Willie Horton [the Massachusetts prisoner who

committed rape and assault while on furlough] could be used as a very profound

symbol by the Republican Party to win this election, then we will understand

what is happening to the black male in this society. The black male is a threat

to white genetic annihilation. And so he is profoundly attacked in this

society."<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





<p>

THE ROOTS OF OUR RACE-CHARGED POLITICS<p>



<font size=5>I</font>n the gulf between Frances Welsing and Dan Donahue one can see evidence of a

political struggle that goes back to the 1960s. When one looks at recent

political history through the prism of our current race-charged politics,

familiar events take on a new significance. From the perspective of 1991, for

example, the presidential election of 1964 stands out as a turning point in the

politics of race in the United States. That election forced race, already a

volatile national issue, into the partisan competition between the Democratic

and Republican parties. The 1964 contest pitted the Democrat Lyndon Johnson,

the leading supporter of the recently passed Civil Rights Act (which granted

full U.S. citizenship rights to blacks for the first time in history), against

the Republican Barry Goldwater, an ideological conservative and a strong

opponent of the bill. By Election Day, 1964, an exceptional 75 percent of the

electorate knew that Congress had that year passed the bill, with a striking 96

percent of those voters aware that Johnson had backed the measure and 84

percent aware that Goldwater had opposed it.<p>



The Democratic and Republican nominees' polarized positions on civil rights

immediately transformed public perceptions of the two parties. Two years before

the 1964 election, polls conducted by National Election Studies showed

virtually no difference in the public assessment of whether the Democratic or

the Republican Party would be "more likely to see to it that Negroes get fair

treatment in jobs and housing." Of those polled in the 1962 survey, 22.7

percent identified the Democrats as more likely to protect black interests,

21.3 percent identified the Republicans, and the remaining 56 percent said

either that there was no difference between the parties or that they had no

opinion. By 1964, however, fully 60 percent identified the Democratic Party as

more likely to help blacks get fair treatment in seeking jobs, and only seven

percent identified the Republican Party--the party of Abraham Lincoln.<p>



By 1964 the Democrats had become the party of racial liberalism and the

Republicans had become the party of racial conservatism. It was the first and

last presidential election in which racial liberalism was politically

advantageous.<p>



The event most strikingly associated with the decline in political support for

Democratic liberalism was the riot that broke out on August 11, 1965, in the

Watts section of Los Angeles. Blacks throwing rocks and bottles at policemen

shouted, "Burn, baby, burn!" as television cameras rolled. By August 16, after

the National Guard had been called in and order slowly restored, there were

thirty-four dead, more than 1,000 injured, over 800 buildings damaged or

destroyed, and nearly 4,000 arrests. Even Martin Luther King, Jr., the leader

of black protests since the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955, was unprepared for

Watts. Stunned by the scope of anger among rioters, and by their perception

that the civil-rights movement had been largely irrelevant to improving

conditions in the ghetto, King "was absolutely undone" after visiting Watts,

his close associate Bayard Rustin recalled.<p>



A succession of other violent eruptions followed over the next three years.

According to the Kerner Commission, appointed to investigate the causes of

rioting, in 1967 there were 164 "disorders," eight of them ranked as "major" on

the grounds that they involved "many fires, intensive looting, and reports of

sniping; violence lasting more than two days; sizeable crowds; and use of

National Guard or federal forces as well as other control forces." More than

eighty people were killed, nearly 90 percent of them black civilians and 10

percent policemen, firemen, and other public officials. More than three

quarters of the deaths were in two cities, Detroit (forty-three) and Newark

(twenty-three). During the five-year period 1964-1968, according to one

estimate, 329 significant outbreaks of violence took place in 257 cities.

Seventy-two percent of rioters in Newark surveyed by the Kerner Commission said

they agreed with the statement "Sometimes I hate white people"--a finding

painful to white liberals.<p>



The sea change in American presidential politics--the replacement of a liberal

majority with a conservative majority--involved the conversion of a relatively

small proportion of voters: the roughly five to ten percent of the electorate,

made up primarily of white working-class voters, empowered to give majority

status to either political party. Alabama Governor George C. Wallace was the

politician who showed the Republicans how to seize lower-income white voters.

Running as a third-party candidate in 1968, Wallace capitalized on the huge

defection of white Democrats, particularly in the South, as the Democratic

Party formally repudiated segregation. He won just under 14 percent of the

vote. Wallace and Nixon together that year won 57 percent of the vote, however,

establishing what would become the conservative presidential majority. This

majority carried every presidential election but one over the next twenty

years--the exception being Southern Baptist Jimmy Carter's victory in the wake

of Watergate, the worst Republican scandal in history.<p>



The strength of Wallace's appeal in 1968 went beyond white backlash. Wallace

defined a new right-wing populism, capitalizing on voter reaction to the

emergence of racial, cultural, and moral liberalism. Wallace demonized an elite

Democratic establishment, providing a desperately sought-after moral

justification to those whites who saw themselves as victimized and displaced by

the black struggle for civil rights and by broader social change. For these

voters, Wallace portrayed the civil-rights movement not as the struggle of

blacks to achieve equality--a goal impossible to challenge on moral

grounds--but as the imposition of intrusive "social engineering" on working men

and women by a coercive federal government in the hands of a liberal cabal:

lawyers, judges, editorial writers, government bureaucrats, and intellectuals.

"They have looked down their noses at the average man on the street too long,"

Wallace told disaffected voters. "They've looked down at the bus driver, the

truck driver, the beautician, the fireman, the policeman, and the steelworker,

the plumber, and the communications worker, and the oil worker, and the little

businessman, and they say, 'We've gotta write a guideline. We've gotta tell you

when to get up in the morning. We've gotta tell you when to go to bed at

night.'" Wallace laid the groundwork for the Republican assault on "reverse

discrimination." "You know who the biggest bigots in the world are--they're the

ones who call others bigots," he declared at a Milwaukee rally, as he struggled

to be heard over the shouts of protesters. In another campaign speech he said,

"It's a sad day in the country when you can't talk about law and order unless

they want to call you a racist. I tell you that's not true."<p>



Perhaps most important for long-range Republican strategy, Wallace brought into

mainstream presidential politics a new political symbol, a vilified Democratic

establishment that replaced as an enemy of lower-income voters the Republican

establishment of corporate America and the rich. Wallace effectively portrayed

this Democratic establishment as bent on imposing a liberal, authoritarian,

statist agenda on an unwilling electorate.<p>



To voters resentful of the heavy hand of the new liberal establishment, Wallace

said, "You are one man and one woman, and your thoughts are just as good as

theirs."<p>



Richard Nixon set out to win the Wallace vote. Nixon was among the first

Republicans to understand how the changing civil-rights agenda could be

manipulated to construct a new conservative majority. His strategy effectively

straddled the conflict between increasing public support for the abstract

principle of racial equality and intensified public opposition to

government-driven enforcement mechanisms. Nixon found a message that

encompassed the position of the growing majority of white Americans who had

come to believe that the denial of basic citizenship rights to blacks was

wrong, but who were at the same time opposed to the prospect of forced

residential and educational integration, directed by the courts and the federal

regulatory bureaucracy<p>



When, in October of 1969, the Supreme Court rejected an Administration attempt

to postpone the desegregation of Mississippi's schools, Nixon declared, "We

will carry out the law," but he stressed that he did "not feel obligated to do

any more than the minimum the law required." The Court ruling, Nixon warned,

should not be viewed by "the many young liberal lawyers [in the Justice

Department]...as a carte blanche for them to run wild through the South

enforcing compliance with extreme or punitive requirements they had formulated

in Washington." On the campaign trail in 1972 Nixon declared,<p>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

There is no reason to feel guilty about wanting to enjoy what you get and

get what you earn, about wanting your children in good schools close to home,

or about wanting to be judged fairly on your ability. Those are not values to

be ashamed of; those are values to be proud of. Those are values that I shall

always stand up for when they come under attack.<p>

<p>

THE REPUBLICAN RACIAL STRATEGY<p>



<font size=5>A</font> central irony of the Nixon administration was that the development of a

Republican alternative--"black capitalism"--to the traditional civil-rights

agenda created a critical vulnerability for Democrats in the 1980s. Under black

capitalism the federal government began actively to promote three

racial-preference programs that would soon become controversial: a minority

contracting program known as "8-a," which set aside fixed percentages of

federal contracts for minority-owned businesses; the Office of Minority

Business Enterprise, established within the Department of Commerce to assist

minority business in securing government contracts; and, most important, the

so-called Philadelphia Plan, designed to increase black access to high-paying

union jobs.<p>



The Philadelphia Plan established the authority of the federal government to

require companies doing business with the government to set up "goals and

timetables" for the hiring and promotion of minority members. The plan set

specific percentage "ranges" for blacks and other minority groups for

craft-union jobs. For example, plumbers and pipefitters, of whom only twelve

out of 2,335 in Philadelphia were black (0.5 percent), were given a hiring goal

of five to eight percent in 1970, a range that would rise to 22 to 26 percent

by 1973. The goals-and-timetables mechanism was incorporated in 1970 into the

regulations governing all federal procurement and contracting--affecting a

universe of corporations that employed more than a third of the nation's work

force.<p>



Nixon in 1969 did not anticipate that the affirmative-action provisions of his

Philadelphia Plan would become, in the course of the next twenty years,

essential to a Republican strategy of polarizing the electorate along lines of

race--and thus be vital to constructing a presidential partisan realignment. It

did not take him long to learn, however: by the 1972 election Nixon was

campaigning against the quota policies that his own Administration had largely

engendered.<p>



It was Nixon's re-election campaign that developed a relatively comprehensive

Republican racial strategy stressing whenever possible the costs of remedies

for discrimination, especially in the cases of busing and affirmative action.

On March 17, 1972, Nixon escalated his assault on busing. The school bus, "once

a symbol of hope," had become a "symbol of social engineering on the basis of

abstractions," he said. Seeking to reap political rewards from the growing

stockpile of blue-collar resentment, Nixon turned against his own Philadelphia

Plan: "When young people apply for jobs...and find the door closed because they

don't fit into some numerical quota, despite their ability, and they object, I

do not think it is right to condemn those young people as insensitive or even

racist."<p>



<p>

THE DEMOCRATS BECOME A WHITE-COLLAR PARTY<p>



<font size=5>I</font>n devising a political strategy for capturing white working-class and southern

voters, the Nixon Administration in 1972 would have had difficulty designing a

scenario more advantageous to the Republicans, and more damaging to the

Democratic-Party, than the one the Democrats devised for themselves. This

scenario grew out of a seemingly minor development at the 1968 Democratic

convention. As a token gesture of appeasement to the forces of Eugene McCarthy

and Robert Kennedy, Democratic Party regulars allowed the creation of a special

Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, to ensure that "all

feasible efforts have been made to assure that delegates are selected through

party primary, convention, or committee procedures open to public participation

within the calendar year of the National Convention."<p>



No one, neither Democratic Party regulars nor the press, had any notion of the

scope of what had been set in motion. "There was not much attention to the

Rules Committee reports," Max Kampelman, one of Hubert Humphrey's major

strategists, recalled later. "Our objective was to get a nominee....We said to

ourselves, if you are going to STUDY it, you can control it. If you get the

nomination, you'll have control of the DNC [Democratic National Committee]. If

you have the DNC, then you'll control any study. A study commission could be a

way of harmonizing the issue." Few political judgments have proved more

incorrect.<p>



The liberal-reform wing of the Democratic Party--in part made up of veterans of

the civil-rights and student anti-war movements--dominated the party-structure

commission and achieved a radical alteration of the presidential-delegate

selection process. The new rules shifted the power to nominate presidential

candidates from the loose alliance of state and local party structures, which

had in the past been empowered to use their control of the party to pick

delegates, to the universe of activists, often rights-oriented liberal

reformers, who were now granted direct access to the machinery of delegate

selection. "Before reform," Byron Shafer wrote in his book describing the party

rules changes, Quiet Revolution,<p>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

there was an American party system in which one party, the Republicans, was

primarily responsive to white-collar constituencies and in which another, the

Democrats, was primarily responsive to blue-collar constituencies. After

reform, there were two parties each responsive to quite different white-collar

coalitions, while the old blue-collar majority within the Democratic Party was

forced to try to squeeze back into the party once identified predominantly with

its needs.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



In other words, those who unquestionably lost power in the Democratic

presidential-nomination process were the white working- and lower-middle-class

voters who were already leaving the party in droves because they felt the

heaviest burdens of the civil-rights revolution had been placed on their

shoulders.<p>



Party reforms produced a substantive ideological upheaval. Before 1972,

Democratic presidential delegates were only slightly more liberal than the

public at large, according to delegate surveys, while Republican delegates were

considerably more conservative than the electorate. Delegates to the 1972

Democratic convention, however, were significantly further to the political

left of the electorate at large than the Republican delegates that year were to

the right.<p>



No development better summarizes the shift in intra-party power than the

decision by the McGovern forces at the 1972 convention to oust the

fifty-nine-member Cook County delegation under the control of Chicago Mayor

Richard Daley. Since 1932 the Chicago organization had been more important to

the success or failure of Democratic presidential candidates than any other

city machine. Without Daley in 1960, for example, John F. Kennedy would not

have carried Illinois by an 8,858-vote margin.<p>



The Cook County delegation, elected in a March 21 Illinois primary, was

vulnerable to challenge because Daley's machine had slated candidates in closed

meetings, and because the composition of the Chicago delegation did not include

the required proportions of women and blacks.<p>



Pro-McGovern reformers successfully voted out the Daley delegates and replaced

them with a slate "chosen no one knew quite how," according to Theodore H.

White. White wrote,<p>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

In the 1st Congressional District of Chicago, for example, a group of people

had met at the home of one James Clement and decided that only ten of those

present might vote for an alternate to Mayor Daley's slate; those ten had

chosen 7 delegates, including the Reverend Jesse Jackson. This rival

hand-picked alternate slate offered the exact proportion of women, blacks and

youth required by the McGovern reform rules. Yet the elected slate in the 1st

Congressional had been voted in by the people of Chicago, and these had not.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



In an open letter to Alderman William Singer, the leader of the Chicago

reformers, the Chicago Sun-Times columnist Mike Royko wrote,<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

I just don't see where your delegation is representative of Chicago's

Democrats....About half of your delegates are women. About a third of your

delegates are black. Many of them are young people. You even have a few Latin

Americans. But as I looked over the names of your delegates, I saw something

peculiar...There's only one Italian there. Are you saying that only one out of

every 59 Democratic votes cast in a Chicago election is cast by an Italian? And

only three of your 59 have Polish names....Your reforms have disenfranchised

Chicago's white ethnic Democrats, which is a strange reform....Anybody who

would reform Chicago's Democratic Party by dropping the white ethnic would

probably begin a diet by shooting himself in the stomach.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





After the credentials committee voted seventy-one to sixty-one to oust the

Daley delegation, Frank Mankiewicz, a spokesman for the McGovern campaign,

dryly noted, "I think we may have lost Illinois tonight."<p>



In the 1972 general election, George McGovern lost not only Illinois but

forty-eight other states, being defeated by 61 percent to 38 percent, or 18

million votes. For the long-run future of the capacity of the Democratic Party

to nominate and elect Presidents, the central issue was not just the magnitude

of McGovern's defeat. It was the inability of the Democratic Party to absorb

competing factions and to mediate the differences among them. The new rules

removed from the presidential-nomination process those white elected and party

officials who were closer to the racial and cultural conflicts plaguing the

party than the liberal reformers who dominated the proceedings. Among those who

did not attend the 1972 convention were 225 of 255 Democratic congressmen, the

Democratic mayors of Los Angeles, Detroit, Boston, Philadelphia, and San

Francisco, Mayor Daley and his Chicago loyalists, and uncounted city

councilmen, state legislators, and leaders of Democratic ward organizations.<p>



These leaders represented white voters who were on the front lines of urban

housing integration; who were the subjects of busing orders; who were

competitors for jobs as policemen and firemen and union craftsmen which were

governed by affirmative-action consent decrees; who regarded as

incomprehensible many liberal Supreme Court decisions on criminals' rights,

abortion, sexual privacy, school prayer, busing, and obscenity. These voters

and their political representatives were, and still are, largely relegated to

peripheral status in the Democratic presidential-primary process. With the

withdrawal of socially conservative white voters from the nomination process,

Democratic presidential candidates have negotiated that process in the context

of an artificially liberal primary electorate that puts the candidates outside

the ideological mainstream and provides them with virtually no training in the

kinds of accommodation and bargaining essential to general-election victory.<p>





<p>

THE CIVIL RIGHTS AGENDA BECOMES REDISTRIBUTIVE<p>



<font size=5>A</font>s the white working-class voters who had formed the core of the New Deal

coalition began to lose clout within the Democratic Party, the economy began to

falter. Steady economic growth, which had made redistributive government

policies tolerable to the majority electorate, came to a halt in the mid-1970s.

With stagnation the threat to Democratic liberalism intensified. Just as the

civil-rights movement reached its height, high-paying union jobs and big-city

patronage--which had served to foster upward mobility for each succeeding

immigrant generation--began to dry up. Many blacks lost even a toehold on the

ladder, while whites slipped down, sometimes just a rung, sometimes all the way

to the bottom.<p>



The end of vigorous post-Second World War economic growth came in 1973. Hourly

earnings, which had grown every year since 1951 in real, inflation-adjusted

dollars, fell by 0.1 percent in 1973, by 2.8 percent in 1974, and by 0.7

percent in 1975. Weekly earnings fell more sharply, by 4.1 percent in 1974 and

by 3.1 percent in 1975. Median family income, which had grown from $20,415 (in

1985 inflation-adjusted dollars) in 1960 to $29,172 in 1973, began to decline;

family income fell to $28,145 in 1974 and then to $27,421 in 1975.<p>



In a whipsaw action the middle-class tax burden rose with inflation while the

economy and real income growth slowed. The tax system was losing its

progressivity, placing a steadily increasing share of the cost of government on

middle- and lower-middle-class voters, vital constituencies for the Democratic

Party. In 1953 a family making the median family income was taxed at a rate of

11.8 percent, while a family making four times the median was taxed at 20.2

percent, nearly double. By 1975 the figures had become 22.7 percent for the

average family and 29.5 percent for the affluent family. In other words, for

the affluent family the tax burden increased by 46 percent from 1953 to 1976,

while for the average family it increased by 92.4 percent.<p>



As the job market, income patterns, and growing pressure from many groups for

spending on the poor created a competition for government funds in which there

were more losers than winners, the civil-rights agenda itself became

increasingly redistributive. In order to remedy past and present discrimination

in both employment and education, the courts and the federal regulatory

structure turned to tough affirmative-action policies. Federal directives and

regulations--developed in part by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

and endorsed by the Supreme Court in 1971 in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. and in

later decisions--sharply restricted hiring and promotion procedures that

adversely affected blacks.<p>



The most aggressive efforts to provide jobs for blacks were directed at the

most besieged white Democratic constituencies: the building-trades unions and

police and fire departments. White men working as carpenters, plumbers,

sheet-metal workers, iron workers, steamfitters, cops, and firemen became the

focus of the anti-discrimination drive waged by the Civil Rights Division of

the Justice Department.<p>



The dilemma inherent in using racial preference to remedy past discrimination

is sharply reflected in Justice William Brennan's 1976 majority opinion

upholding the award of retroactive seniority to blacks in Franks v. Bowman

Transportation Co., Inc., and in the dissenting opinion of Justice Lewis

Powell.<p>



Brennan wrote that retroactive seniority was essential for the victim of

discrimination, because without it he<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

will never obtain his rightful place in the hierarchy of seniority according

to which these various employment benefits are distributed. He will perpetually

remain subordinate to persons who, but for the illegal discrimination, would

have been, in respect to entitlement to these benefits, his inferiors.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





Powell, on the other hand, contended that the award of retroactive seniority

would penalize "the rights and expectations of perfectly innocent employees.

The economic benefits awarded discrimination victims would be derived not at

the expense of the employer but at the expense of other workers."<p>



The intensity of the conflict over affirmative action can be seen in less

abstract terms in Birmingham, Alabama. Not until 1968--103 years after the end

of the Civil War--did the Birmingham fire department hire its first black

fireman. Throughout all those years blacks were systematically denied the

opportunity not only of employment but also of building seniority and learning

the promotional ropes. Legal proceedings were initiated against the city in

1974, the year the second black fireman was hired. Richard Arrington,

Birmingham's first black mayor, was elected in 1979, and two years later the

city agreed to a consent decree providing that every white hire or promotion

would be matched, one for one, by a black hire or promotion, as long as blacks

were available who had fulfilled basic test requirements.<p>



In 1983 James Hanson, a white fireman, and Carl Cook, a black fireman, both

took the Birmingham Fire Department test for lieutenant. Both passed, but

Henson ranked sixth among all who took the test, with a score of 192, while

Cook ranked eighty-fifth, with a score of 122. Under the consent decree Cook

was promoted to lieutenant and Henson was not.<p>



Henson became part of a group of whites attempting to challenge the consent

degree. He argued, "I can understand that blacks had been historically

discriminated against. I can also understand why people would want to be

punitive in correcting it. Somebody needs to pay for this. But they want me to

pay for it, and I didn't have anything to do with it. I was a kid when all this

went on."<p>



Cook countered, "Say your father robs a bank, takes the money and buys his

daughter a Mercedes, and then buys his son a Porsche and his wife a home in the

high-rent district. Then they discover he has embezzled the money. He has to

give the cars and house back. And the family starts to cry: 'We didn't do

anything.' The same thing applies to what the whites have to say. The fact is,

sometimes you have to pay up. If a wrong has been committed, you have to right

that wrong."<p>



The Birmingham case represents an extreme: pitting white and black workers

against each other in a competition for government-controlled jobs and

employment benefits. Over time these racial divisions reverberated in

Birmingham's political system. Once, every elected official in this city was a

Democrat; now racial conflict has begun to translate into a local partisan

realignment. By the end of the 1980s Jefferson County, which encompasses

Birmingham, had its eighteen seats in the state House of Representatives split

between blacks and whites. In partisan terms there were eight black Democrats,

one white Democrat, and nine white Republicans. Among the white Republican

state representatives was Billy Gray, a former president of the Firefighters

Union. Race had become central to establishing partisan difference.<p>



The same zero-sum element of affirmative action in employment is applicable to

higher education. "We are committed to a program of affirmative action, and we

want to make the university representative of the population of the state as a

whole," James A. Blackburn, the dean of admissions at the University of

Virginia, said in 1988. "That means fewer spaces for the traditional mainstream

white students who have come here from around the country....If you were

looking at the academic credentials, you would say Virginia has it upside down.

We take more in the groups with weaker credentials and make it harder for those

with stronger credentials."<p>



<p>

REAGAN AND RACE<p>



<font size=5>E</font>xplosive forces--stagnant incomes, declining numbers of manufacturing jobs,

inflation-driven increases in marginal tax rates, sharply accelerating welfare

dependency, skyrocketing crime, soaring illegitimacy, and affirmative-action

competition for jobs and college placement--began to reach the point of

combustion in the mid-to-late 1970s. Democrats failed to recognize the threat

these forces represented; leaders of the party were given false comfort by the

belief that Watergate had done irreparable harm to the Republicans.<p>



The importance of race in the chain of events that brought Ronald Reagan to the

White House--from the Great Inflation of the 1970s to the California tax

revolt--cannot be overestimated. Reagan, echoing Goldwater from sixteen years

before, strengthened the image of the Republicans as the party of racial

conservatism. Under Reagan in 1980 the percentage of voters who said the

Republican Party was "not likely" to help minorities shot up to 66 percent

(from 40 percent in 1976), while those who said that the party would help

minorities collapsed to 11 percent (from 33 percent). Unlike Goldwater in 1964,

however, Reagan in 1980 demonstrated that racial conservatism was no longer a

liability--that in fact it was a clear asset--as his party made gains at every

level of electoral competition from state legislative seats to the White

House.<p>



Under Reagan the Republican Party in 1980 was able to stake out a conservative

civil-rights stand that won strong majority support. Advocacy of "equal

opportunity"--the original clarion call of the civil-rights movement--became

the center-right position, the core of the new conservative egalitarian

populism. Republican and Democratic differences over what "equal opportunity"

meant reflected, in part, differences in the opinions of whites and blacks. By

the 1980 election the ideological divergence had extended beyond issues of

civil rights to basic questions about the role and responsibilities of the

federal government. In 1980 blacks who believed that it was the responsibility

of government to provide jobs outnumbered those who contended that "government

should just let every person get ahead on his own" by a margin of 70-30,

according to National Election Studies poll data. Whites, however, split in the

opposite direction, contending by a 62-38 margin that government should just

let "everyone get ahead on his own" rather than guaranteeing work.<p>



Responses to this question also revealed the extent to which ideology, voting

patterns, and race had become commingled. In addition to polarizing blacks and

whites, the question was found to polarize Reagan and Carter voters, with

Carter getting 80 percent of those who most strongly supported government

intervention to provide work, and Reagan winning 79 percent of those most

strongly opposed to such intervention.<p>



In a parallel split, Carter received 93 percent of the vote from those

citizens, white and black, who most strongly supported government efforts "to

improve the social and economic position of blacks," while Reagan got 71

percent of those who felt most adamantly that "the government should not make

any special effort to help because they should help themselves."<p>



Race, ideology, and partisanship had become inextricably linked, a linkage that

empowered the Republican Party in its new populism. Lee Atwater, who ran

southern operations for the 1980 campaign and managed George Bush's 1988

campaign, has argued, "In the 1980 campaign we were able to make the

establishment, insofar as it is bad, the government. In other words, big

government was the enemy, not big business. If the people are thinking that the

problem is that taxes are too high and government interferes too much, then we

are doing our job. But if they get to the point where they say the real problem

is that rich people aren't paying taxes, that Republicans are protecting the

realtors and so forth, then I think the Democrats are going to be in pretty

good shape. The National Enquirer readership is the exact voter I'm talking

about. There are always some stories in there about some multimillionaire that

has five Cadillacs and hasn't paid taxes since 1974, or so-and-so Republican

congressman hasn't paid taxes since he got into Congress. And they'll have

another set of stories of a guy sitting around in a big den with liquor saying

so-and-so fills his den with liquor using food stamps." So what determines

whether conservative or liberal egalitarianism is ascendant, Atwater says, is

"which one of those establishments the public sees as a bad guy."<p>



Reagan focused on the right-wing populist strategy described by Atwater,

playing on the combustible mix of race, big government, and white working-class

anger. One of Reagan's favorite anecdotes was the inflated story of a Chicago

"welfare queen" with "eighty names, thirty addresses, twelve Social Security

cards" whose "tax-free income alone is over $150,000." The food-stamp program,

in turn, was a vehicle to let "some young fellow ahead of you buy T-bone steak"

while "you were standing in a checkout line with your package of hamburger."<p>



Such implicitly race-laden images, and the values conflict associated with

welfare and food stamps, furthered the Republican Party's efforts to expand

beyond its traditional base and establish a sustained policy majority--which

supported the first major retrenchment of the liberal government policies of

the 1930s and the 1960s, ranging from assaults on labor to a broad attempt to

dismantle the civil-rights regulatory structure and to overturn court rulings

favoring minorities. In direct contrast to the "bottom-up" coalition of the New

Deal Democratic Party, the new Republican presidential majority was--and is--a

"top-down" coalition.<p>

<p>



WHAT "FAIRNESS"--TO WHOM?<p>



While the Reagan administration repeatedly stressed the costs to white America

of civil-rights enforcement, especially affirmative-action remedies, the

Democratic Party, deliberately or inadvertently, continued to find itself

identified with those costs. Throughout the 1984 campaign Walter Mondale was

repeatedly enmeshed in negotiations with Jesse Jackson, with organized labor,

with feminist groups, and, most damaging of all, with those seeking to raise

taxes to fuel what many voters saw as an intrusive federal government. The

vulnerability of the Democratic Party was reflected in the deeply hostile

public reaction to Mondale's proposal to raise $30 billion in new revenues to

"promote fairness."<p>



The Democratic "fairness" message in 1984 was viewed by a crucial sector of the

white electorate through the prism of race. The Analysis Group, reporting on

the views of white Democratic defectors in Macomb County, Michigan, found

that<p>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

conventional Democratic themes, like opportunity and fairness, are now

invested with all the cynicism and racism that has come to characterize these

sessions [focus groups]. In effect, the themes and Party symbols have been

robbed of any meaning for these Democratic defectors. On hearing the term

'fairness,' these voters recall, on the one hand, 'racial minorities' or 'some

blacks kicking up a storm,' and on the other hand, 'only politics' or

politicians who are 'lying.' It never occurred to these voters that the

Democrats were referring to the middle class.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





Similar views abound among white voters in such communities as Boston,

Philadelphia, New Orleans, Chicago, and rural East Texas. These views are

particularly devastating to the Democratic Party because fairness has become a

central Democratic theme. The 1980 Democratic platform declared, "In all of our

economic programs, the one overriding principle MUST BE FAIRNESS." The platform

of four years later asserted, "A nation is only as strong as its commitment to

justice and equality. Today, A CORROSIVE UNFAIRNESS eats at the underpinnings

of our society." (Emphases added.)<p>



In addition, fairness remains a strong and legitimate issue for the legions of

black Democratic voters. "The issues that concern working-class minorities

comprise the traditional 'fairness' agenda of jobs, housing, welfare, and

education," the voter study by CRG Communications found. "They want more

benefits for themselves and their children. [They] strongly assert the validity

of the 'fairness' theme. They believe that they are entitled to certain

governmental benefits and view the diminishment of those benefits as a betrayal

of a trust."<p>



The association in the minds of many white voters of "fairness" with "fairness

to minorities" has made it very difficult for the Democratic Party to

capitalize on the striking increase in the disparity of income over the past

decade not only between rich and poor but also between the working and

lower-middle classes and the rich. During the 1980s the top one percent saw

after-tax family income grow by 87 percent, from $213,675 in 1980 to $399,697

in 1990 (both figures in 1990 dollars); families just above the median, in the

sixth decile, saw their after-tax income grow by only three percent, from

$25,964 in 1980 to $26,741 in 1990.<p>



In the 1988 election no one knew better than Michael Caccitolo, the Republican

committeeman of Chicago's 23rd Ward, the difficulty of the Democratic Party's

struggle to revive the issue of fairness among the once-Democratic voters of

southwest Chicago. "Every night I sit at home and watch the news," he said. "I

see Jesse [Jackson] up there talking about 'black empowerment, our people,' and

that's sending a message out there that no Democratic precinct captain can

possibly overcome. When the Dan Ryan [Expressway] was being built, the old lady

from Operation Push [Rev. Willie Barrow, at that time the president of

Jackson's Operation Push] comes out and says, 'We are going to close the Dan

Ryan down unless we get more blacks on construction.' The people in the

neighborhood remember that. Nobody threatened to close the Dan Ryan down to get

Polish people on. And they [city and state officials] backed down and they gave

a bunch of black guys entry-level jobs. And look who they threw off and got

sent back to the neighborhood and told, 'Get on unemployment.' All it takes is

two or three of them. Would you define them as Republican precinct captains?

No. Is it advantageous for the Republicans to watch a guy like that sitting in

a tavern drinking his beer and telling the story about how he got bumped? And

then all of a sudden it's six o'clock and [on TV] it's Jesse. It's bad and it

ain't going to get better."<p>

THE SIGNAL OF "CRIME"<p>



<font size=5>I</font>n 1988 the Bush campaign assembled and deployed a range of symbols and images

designed to tap into voters' submerged anxieties about race, culture, rights,

and values--the anxieties that had helped to fuel the conservative politics of

the post-civil-rights era. The symbols of the Bush campaign--Willie Horton, the

ACLU, the death penalty, the Pledge of Allegiance, the flag--and rhetoric such

as "no new taxes," the "L-word," and "Harvard boutique liberal" conjured up the

criminal defendants'- and prisoners'-rights movements, black crime, permissive

liberal elites, a revenue-hungry state, eroding traditional values, tattered

patriotism, and declining American prestige.<p>



Willie Horton represented, for crucial sectors of the electorate, the

consequences of an aggressively expansive liberalism--a liberalism running up

against majority public opinion, against traditional values, and, to a certain

degree, against common sense. Horton came to stand for liberalism's blurring of

legitimate goals, such as helping prisoners judged suitable for rehabilitation

(prisoners, for example, without long records of violence), with the

illegitimate goal, in the majority view, of "coddling" violent and dangerous

criminals whom much of society judges irredeemable.<p>



Republican strategists recognized that the furloughing of Willie Horton

epitomized an evolution of the far-reaching rights movement, an evolution

resented and disapproved of by significant numbers of voters. These voters saw

crime as one of a number of social and moral problems aggravated by liberalism.

The evolving rights movement was seen as extending First Amendment privileges

to hard-core pornography, as allowing welfare recipients to avoid

responsibility for supporting their children, as fostering drug use,

illegitimacy, homosexual promiscuity, and an AIDS epidemic. All these led, in

turn, to demands on taxpayers to foot skyrocketing social-service and

health-care bills.<p>



"Crime" became a shorthand signal, to a crucial group of white voters, for

broader issues of social disorder, evoking powerful ideas about authority,

status, morality, self-control, and race. "On no other issue is the dividing

line so clear, and on no other issue is my opponent's philosophy so completely

at odds with mine, and I would say with the common-sense attitudes of the

American people, than on the issue of crime," Bush declared in an October 7,

1988, campaign speech to police officers in Xenia, Ohio, adding,<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

There are some--and I would list my opponent among them--who have wandered far

off the clear-cut path of common sense and have become lost in the thickets of

liberal sociology. Just as when it comes to foreign policy, they always 'Blame

America First,' when it comes to crime and criminals, they always seem to

'Blame Society First.'...[Criminal justice under Dukakis is] a 'Twilight Zone'

world where prisoners' 'right of privacy' has more weight than the citizen's

right to safety.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



THE RACIAL CHASM<p>



The divisive power of race and race-infused preoccupations with values, class,

and social disorder endured throughout the 1980s, reverberating across the

electorate. Differences of opinion between blacks and whites intensified over

the decade. A 1989 voter study conducted by KRC Research and Consulting for

Democrats For the 90's, a private organization affiliated with the Democratic

Party, revealed the extent to which key white Democratic voters "take issue

with the Democratic rhetoric of representing the 'middle class and the poor.'

These [voters] perceive themselves to be neither rich nor poor, and they do not

like being referred to in the same breath as 'the poor.' They describe

themselves as 'working people.'" Black urban Democratic voters, conversely,

"feel that the country and the Democratic Party are increasingly racist and

that the party cares little for their needs and interests."<p>



Divisions between the races have emerged on a host of fronts. On the basic

question of whether judges and courts treat whites and blacks even-handedly, 56

percent of white New Yorkers in a 1988 WCBS-New York Times poll said they

believed that the system was fair and 27 percent said the system favored one

race over another, with that 27 percent evenly split between those who saw

black favoritism and those who saw white favoritism. Among black New Yorkers

only 30 percent saw the system as fair, and 49 percent saw it as unfair, with

the overwhelming majority of those who perceived unfairness seeing a bias in

favor of whites.<p>



Such highly controversial cases as the 1987 allegations of rape by Tawana

Brawley and the 1984 shooting by the "subway vigilante" Bernhard Goetz of four

black teenagers provoked sharply divergent views from blacks and from whites.

After a grand jury determined in 1988 that Brawley had fabricated her story, 73

percent of white New Yorkers polled by WCBS-New York Times said she lied, while

only 33 percent of blacks were prepared to make that judgment (18 percent said

she told the truth, 14 percent said she didn't know what happened to her, and

35 percent were unwilling to express an opinion). In the case of Goetz, the

WCBS-New York Times poll found in 1985 that the proportion of whites describing

themselves as supportive of the shooting, relative to those who were critical,

was 50-37, as compared with 23-59 among blacks. Whites felt that Goetz was

innocent of attempted murder by a margin of 47-18 (with the rest undecided),

while blacks said that he was guilty by a margin of 42-19. (Hispanics sided

more with whites than with blacks, favoring innocence over guilt at 41-23.)<p>



Underlying these differences in public opinion is a profound gulf between

blacks and whites over the cause of contemporary differences between the races.

In seeking to clarify these differences of opinion, Ron Walters, a black

political scientist at Howard University, has argued that the fundamental issue

in the contemporary politics of race is "Who is responsible for our condition?"

He says, "Once you draw the line on that, you draw the line on a lot of other

race-value issues. Whites see blacks as generally responsible for their own

situation, which means that whites refuse to take responsibility. Blacks see it

differently. They believe there ought to be a continuing assumption of

responsibility for their condition by the government, in addition to what they

do for themselves. And therein lies a lot of the difference."<p>



This racially loaded confrontation over the issue of responsibility, both

historical and contemporary, is perhaps best illustrated by the views of the

political analysts Roger Wilkins and Patrick Buchanan. Wilkins, a black

professor of history at George Mason University and a well-known commentator

who served as an assistant attorney general in the Johnson Administration and

was an editorial writer for The New York Times and The Washington Post, has

written,<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

The issue isn't guilt. It's responsibility. Any fair reading of history will

find that since the mid-seventeenth century whites have oppressed some blacks

so completely as to disfigure their humanity. Too many whites point to the

debased state of black culture and institutions as proof of the inferiority of

the blacks they have mangled....[The logical implication] is simple: black

people simply need to pull up their socks. That idea is wrong and must be

resisted....Like it or not, slavery, the damage from legalized oppression

during the century that followed emancipation, and the racism that still

infects the entire nation follow a direct line to ghetto life today.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



On the other side, Buchanan, an Irish Catholic who was a ranking conservative

strategist for the Nixon and Reagan administrations and remains a widely

followed political columnist and television commentator of the hard right, has

written,<p>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

Why did liberalism fail black America? Because it was built on a myth, the

myth of the Kerner Commission, that the last great impediment to equality in

America was 'white racism.' That myth was rooted in one of the oldest of

self-delusions: It is because you are rich that I am poor. My problems are your

fault. You owe me!<p>



There was a time when white racism did indeed block black progress in America,

but by the time of the Kerner Commission ours was a nation committed to racial

justice....<p>



The real root causes of the crisis in the underclass are twofold. First, the

old character-forming, conscience-forming institutions--family, church, and

school--have collapsed under relentless secular assault; second, as the

internal constraints on behavior were lost among the black poor, the external

barriers--police, prosecutors, and courts--were systematically undermined....<p>



What the black poor need more than anything today is a dose of the truth.

Slums are the products of the people who live there. Dignity and respect are

not handed out like food stamps; they are earned and won....<p>



The first step to progress, for any group, lies in the admission that its

failures are, by and large, its own fault, that success can come only through

its own efforts, that, while the well-intentioned outsider may help, he or she

is no substitute for personal sacrifice.<p>

CAN AMERICA AFFORD AFFIRMATIVE ACTION?<p>

<p>

The conflict represented by Wilkins and Buchanan is driven not only by a

fundamental difference over values and responsibility but also by economic and

demographic forces. These forces are helping to make the political struggle for

public resources and benefits increasingly bitter and increasingly

irreconcilable. In many respects these forces are working in tandem to make the

process of incorporating new groups into the mainstream of American society<p>

more difficult. They include the globalization of the economy, the growing

disparity between the wages paid to the college-educated and the wages paid to

those with a high school diploma or less, the drop in college entry by blacks,

and the emergence of a suburban voting majority.<p>



The globalization of the economy constitutes a fundamental attack on the

mechanisms traditionally relied upon to integrate new untrained and poorly

educated groups into the mainstream of American life. Before the

internationalization of manufacturing, policies and practices ranging from

widespread political patronage to legislation creating the pro-union National

Labor Relations Board forced the incorporation of immigrant groups into the

work force.<p>



The threat represented by overseas competition has thrust American companies

into a battle for survival in which there is little or no room to accommodate

the short-term costs of absorbing blacks and other previously excluded minority

groups into the labor force. And while affirmative action performs for blacks

and other minorities the same function that patronage performed for waves of

immigrants from Ireland and southern Europe, it also imposes costs that place

American companies at a disadvantage in international competition.<p>



These costs lie at the core of the debate over the civil-rights bill of 1991.

Although the issue of quotas has dominated public discussion of the

civil-rights bill, the real battle is over legislating the precise cost to

companies that affirmative-action programs will involve. In an attempt to

overturn recent conservative rulings by the Supreme Court (now dominated by

Republican appointees), the Democratic leadership of Congress has proposed

legislation strictly limiting the use of ability tests and other hiring

procedures with potentially discriminatory impact, even in the absence of

discriminatory intent. If hiring or promotion procedures are found to have

"adverse impact" on blacks--that is, if disproportionately more blacks (or

other minorities) than whites are rejected--employers must demonstrate that

such tests are essential for business operation and meet a stringent "business

necessity" standard. The legislation would in effect overturn a 1989 Supreme

Court decision, Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, that allowed companies to use

ability tests and other hiring criteria that adversely affect blacks and

Hispanics if such criteria met the far less stringent standard of "business

justification." Wards Cost explicitly declared that "there is no requirement

that the challenged practice be 'essential' or 'indispensable' to the

employer's business." Such seemingly arcane and legalistic phrases as "business

necessity" and "business justification" can have profound consequences. If, for

example, companies were permitted to use scores on ability tests as a hiring

criterion, it would at present be a major setback to the hiring of blacks and

Hispanics--unless scores were adjusted for differences among whites, blacks,

Hispanics. and other groups (a scoring process termed "within-group scoring,"

"within-group adjustment," or "race-norming").<p>



The importance of restricted ability testing for the employment prospects of

blacks and Hispanics has been documented in two book-length studies, Ability

Testing (1982) and Fairness in Employment Testing (1989), by the National

Research Council. On almost all ability tests studied, the council found

(without engaging the unresolved issue of causes), blacks scored substantially

below whites, and Hispanics scored somewhere in between. One study found, for

example, that on average, if hiring were done strictly on the basis of

ability-test scores, an employer selecting from a pool of 100 whites and 100

blacks would take only three blacks in the first twenty-three applicants

chosen, and only six blacks in the first thirty-six. The differences in

test-score results are reduced, but remain substantial, for blacks and whites

of similar income and education.<p>



The contemporary conflict over affirmative action is rooted in the issue of

test scores. Everywhere from college admissions to hiring for jobs, tests have

become a primary instrument for determining personal status, income, and

security. On one side of the debate it is argued that the unrestricted use of

ability tests imposes an extraordinary burden on blacks, Hispanics, and other

minorities; on the other that prohibiting ability testing imposes costs on the

economy in terms of lost productivity and efficiency.<p>

<p>



THE NEW SEGREGATION<p>



<font size=5>W</font>hile low-skill, entry-level jobs have moved overseas to low-wage countries,

the domestic job market has changed in ways that work to enlarge, rather than

to lessen, disparities in the incomes of whites and of blacks. The growing

demand for college-educated workers and the decline in demand for low-skill

manual workers have in recent years substantially changed wage patterns.<p>



From 1975 to 1988 the average earnings of entry-level workers with college or

more-advanced degrees rose from about 130 percent to about 180 percent of the

earnings of workers with high school diplomas. This shift was inherently

damaging to blacks: in 1988, 13.1 percent of blacks between the ages of

twenty-five and thirty-four had college degrees, as compared with 24.5 percent

of whites.<p>



Compounding this disparity is a second development: just as the value of a

college education has skyrocketed, the percentage of blacks between the ages of

eighteen and twenty-four who go on to college and get a degree has fallen. From

1976 to 1988 the percentage of blacks aged eighteen to twenty-four enrolled in

college fell from 22.6 to 21.1, while the percentage of whites rose from 27.1

to 31.3.<p>



The effect of these two trends has been to undermine what was a powerful drive

toward economic and educational equality between the races. In the ten years

immediately following the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the economy

pushed the earnings of both blacks and whites who were in the work force

steadily upward. There was a strong convergence of shared prosperity and

growing racial equality. From 1963 to 1973 average weekly earnings for everyone

grew from $175.17 to $198.35, in 1977 inflation-adjusted dollars. As wages rose

for whites and blacks, income differentials were sharply reduced: from 1963 to

1977-1978 the difference between black and white wages dropped from the 45

percent range down to the 30 percent range, a drop of about one percentage

point a year. For younger, well-educated workers the gap had almost disappeared

by the mid-1970s.<p>



Starting in the late 1970s and continuing into the early 1980s, however, the

situation began to change radically. While the income of college graduates

continued to rise, the income of high school graduates began to fall. At the

same time that the so-called "college wage premium" rose, the wage levels for

job categories that employ disproportionately more whites (professionals,

managers, and sales personnel) grew substantially faster than wage levels for

those categories employing disproportionate numbers of blacks (machine

operatives and clerical, service, and household workers).<p>



The result has been a striking shift in racial wage patterns. Starting at the

end of the 1970s the convergence between the incomes of working blacks and

whites--a convergence that had the potential in the long run to enlarge the

economic common ground between the races--came to a halt. In the late 1970s

black wages abruptly stopped catching up to white wages, with the differential

stagnating at roughly 30 percent.<p>



For a Democratic Party seeking to build a majority coalition aligning the

interests of blacks and whites, this was a grave blow. The failure of the trend

toward wage equality to continue has encouraged the conflict between black and

white world views, in which black gains are seen as a cost to whites, and white

advantages are seen as a manifestation of racism.<p>

<p>



RACE AND THE SUBURBS<p>



Just as wage and education patterns are working to undermine what was a trend

toward economic equality between the races, the dominant demographic trend in

the nation--suburbanization--is working to intensify the geographic separation

of the races, particularly of whites from poor blacks.<p>



The 1992 election will be the first in which the suburban vote, as determined

from U.S. Census data, will be an absolute majority of the total electorate.

From 1968 to 1988 the percentage of the presidential vote cast in suburbs grew

from 35.6 percent to 48.3 percent, and there will be a gain of at least two

percent by l992 under current trends.<p>



Suburban growth will in all likelihood profoundly change national politics, and

will further deepen schisms between the public-policy interests of the two

races. Although opinion polls show increasing support for government

expenditures on education, health, recreation, and a range of other desired

public services, a growing percentage of white voters are discovering that they

can become fiscal liberals at the local SUBURBAN level while remaining

conservative about federal spending. These voters can satisfy their need for

government services through increased local expenditures, guaranteeing the

highest possible return to themselves on their tax dollars, while continuing to

demand austerity at the federal level. Suburbanization has permitted whites to

satisfy liberal ideals revolving around activist government while keeping to a

minimum the number of blacks and poor people who share in government largesse.<p>



For example, the residents of Gwinnett County, Georgia, which is one of the

fastest-growing suburban jurisdictions in the United States, heavily Republican

(76 percent for Bush), affluent, and predominantly white (93.6 percent)--have

been willing to tax and spend on their own behalf as liberally as any

Democrats. County voters have in recent years approved a special recreation

tax; all school, library, and road bond issues; and a one percent local sales

tax.<p>



The accelerated growth of the suburbs has made it possible for many Americans

to pursue certain civic ideals (involvement in schools, cooperation in

community endeavors, a willingness to support and to pay for public services)

within a smaller universe, separate and apart from the consuming failure

(crime, welfarism, decay) of the older cities.<p>



If a part of the solution to the devastating problems of the underclass

involves investment in public services, particularly in the public school

systems of the nation's major cities, the growing division between city and

suburb lessens white self-interest in making such an investment. In 1986 fully

27.5 percent of all black schoolchildren, and 30 percent of all Hispanic

schoolchildren, were enrolled in the twenty-five largest central-city school

districts. Only 3.3 percent of all white students were in these same

twenty-five districts. In other words, 96.7 percent of white children are

educated outside these decaying school systems.<p>



Even within major cities there is a growing divergence of interest between

blacks and whites. Many of the more affluent citizens in racially mixed cities

are turning to private service providers, including independent and parochial

schools. Private police and security services, proliferating private

recreational clubs, and private transportation companies.<p>

<p>



THE END OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY?<p>



In political terms race clearly remains a republican trump card, while racial

fissures within the Democratic Party leave it weakened and vulnerable.<p>



On a broad strategic scale the Republican Party over the past two years has

taken steps to capture the fairness issue and to defuse charges of Republican

racism, initiating an aggressive drive to win the support of affluent blacks

and even running, on occasion, fully competitive black candidates. Income

trends in the black community suggest a reservoir of prospective Republican

support: the income of the top fifth of black families has over the past two

decades been growing at a significantly faster rate than the income of the top

fifth of white families. Trends among the well-to-do of both races have led to

increasing racial equality of income, in sharp contrast to trends among the

least affluent blacks and whites: the bottom fifth of the black community is

falling steadily further behind the bottom fifth of the white community<p>



Insofar as the Republican drive to win support among affluent middle-class

blacks is successful, and insofar as the party is able to insulate itself from

charges of racism, it will further isolate the national Democratic Party as the

party of poor, underclass black America. The isolation of the Democratic Party

continues a process damaging to the vitality of the American political

system.<p>



Fissures resulting from racial conflict, and fissures resulting from tensions

over rights, culture, and values, separate the national Democratic Party from

many of its former constituents. Such fissures have forced the party to

increase its dependence on special interests in order to maintain its

congressional majority.<p>



Without the resource of plurality voter loyalty, Democratic members of the

House of Representatives--the seemingly unshakable bastion of Democratic power

in Washington--have come to rely increasingly on an essentially corrupt system

of campaign finance, on the perquisites of incumbency, on pork-barrel spending,

and on the gerrymandering of districts in order to thwart continuing

demographic and ideological shifts favoring their opponents.<p>



As recently as the mid-1970s the Democratic Party was able to portray itself as

the party of political reform battling a Republican Party dominated by moneyed

interests. Now Democrats in the House of Representatives are more dependent on

institutionalized special-interest groups than are their Republican

adversaries. In 1990 the majority--52.6 percent--of the campaign contributions

received by Democratic incumbent House members running for re-election came

from political-action committees, while the percentage of support from

individual donors represented a steady decline, from 44.8 percent in 1984 to

38.0 percent in 1990. Republican House incumbents, in contrast, received 50.9

percent of their financial support from individuals in 1988, and 41.1 percent

from PACs, in a pattern virtually the mirror image of the Democrats'. In 1988

not only did labor PACs follow tradition by giving far more to Democratic House

incumbents ($16.7 million) than to Republican incumbents ($1.9 million), but

corporate PACs--the contemporary version of "moneyed interests"--gave more

money to Democratic House incumbents ($15.7 million) than to their Republican

counterparts ($13.5 million). While helpful to incumbents in the short term,

this kind of contribution pattern weakens any claim the Democratic Party may

make to provide popular representation.<p>



The Democratic reliance on special interests in fact extends beyond Congress to

a second party stronghold, the nation's major cities. The public's ability to

direct essential services--most important, the public school system--has been

lost in varying degrees to institutionalized bureaucracies. Within urban school

systems faced with declining tax bases and lessened federal support,

associations and unions representing teachers, principals, administrators,

clerical staff, custodians, carpenters, and security guards have become

politically influential in protecting their members' tenure while carefully

limiting their responsibility for meeting the larger goal--that of producing

well-educated students.<p>



Democratic vulnerability on this terrain is perhaps nowhere better reflected

than in Detroit--possibly the most Democratic municipality in the nation, a

city with one of the nation's worst school systems and perhaps the worst

delivery of public services. In recent years Detroit voters elected a black

Republican school-board president and a black Republican city councilman. Both

were elected on platforms of promises to break through bureaucratic

ossification and revive competitive market forces, through parental choice in

school assignments, through private alternatives to public services, and

through the transfer of power and responsibility from administrators downtown

to principals and teachers in the trenches.<p>



The congressional wing of the Democratic Party has become locked into an

alliance with the forces of reaction--with interests and bureaucracies

conducting largely futile efforts to resist, among other things, the

consequences of international economic change. The Democratic Party has, in

many respects, discovered that survival depends on the creation of a

congressional party entrusted by the people to look after parochial

interests--from water projects to rice subsidies to highways to health care for

the elderly. However, to the degree that presidential elections have become

referenda on the nexus of social, moral, racial, and cultural issues in the

broadest sense, the Democratic Party has in five of the past six elections been

at a competitive disadvantage.<p>



The losers in this process are not only the Democratic Party and liberalism but

also the constituencies and alliances they are obliged to represent. The

fracturing of the Democratic coalition has permitted the moral, social, and

economic ascendance of the affluent in a nation with a strong egalitarian

tradition, and has permitted a diminution of economic reward and of social

regard for those who simply work for a living, black and white. Democratic

liberalism--the political ideology that helped to produce a strong labor

movement, that extended basic rights to all citizens, and that has nurtured

free political and artistic expression--has lost the capacity to represent

effectively the allied interests of a biracial, cross-class coalition.

Liberalism, discredited among key segments of the electorate, is no longer a

powerful agent of constructive change. Instead, liberal values, policies, and

allegiances have become a source of bitter conflict among groups that were once

common beneficiaries of the progressive state.<p>



The failures of Democratic liberalism pose a larger problem. With the decline

of liberal hegemony, conservatism has gained control over national elections

and, to a significant degree, over the national agenda. No matter what its

claims, conservatism has served for much of the twentieth century as the

political and philosophical arm of the affluent. Entrusting the economic

interests of the poor and the working class to such a philosophy risks serious

damage to both groups.<p>



That conservatism represents the interests of the well-to-do is to be

expected--and even respected--as part of the system of representation in

American democracy. A far more threatening development is that as liberalism

fails to provide effective challenge, the country will lack the dynamism that

only a sustained and vibrant insurgency of those on the lower rungs can

provide. Such an insurgency, legitimately claiming for its supporters an equal

opportunity to participate and to compete and to gain a measure of justice, is

critical, not only to the politics and the economics of the nation but also to

the vitality of the broader culture and to democracy itself.<p>



Over the past twenty-five years liberalism has avoided confronting, and

learning from, the experience of voter rejection, as institutional power and a

sequence of extraneous events--ranging from Watergate to the 1981-1982

recession--have worked to prop up the national Democratic Party. For the

current cycle to reach closure, and for there to be a breakthrough in stagnant

partisan competition, the Democratic Party may have either to suffer a

full-scale domestic defeat, including (to deal in the extremes of possibility)

loss of control of the Senate and the House, or at the very least to go through

the kind of nadir--intraparty conflict, challenge to ideological orthodoxy, in

short, a form of civil war--experienced by the Republican Party and the right

in the 1960s. The original strength of Democratic liberalism was its capacity

to build majorities out of minorities--a strength that comes only from a real

understanding of what it means to be out of power, from direct engagement in

the struggle to build a majority, and from an understanding of what is worth

fighting for in this struggle. Recapturing the ability to build a winning

alliance requires learning the full meaning of defeat, and developing a

conscious awareness of precisely what the electorate will support politically,

what it will not, and when--if ever--something more important is at stake.<p>

	<font size=5>M</font>y former university offered minority students a faculty mentor to help 
shepherd them into college life. As soon as I learned of the program, I 
volunteered to be a mentor, but by then the school year was nearly over. 
Undaunted, the program's eager staff matched me with a student on their 
waiting list--an appealing nineteen-year-old black woman from Detroit, the 
same age as my daughter. We met finally in a campus lunch spot just about 
two weeks before the close of her freshman year. I realized quickly that I 
was too late. I have heard that the best way to diagnose someone's 
depression is to note how depressed you feel when you leave the person. 
When our lunch was over, I felt as gray as the snowbanks that often lined 
the path back to my office. My lunchtime companion was a statistic brought 
to life, a living example of one of the most disturbing facts of racial 
life in America today: the failure of so many black Americans to thrive in 
school. Before I could lift a hand to help this student, she had decided 
to do what 70 percent of all black Americans at four-year colleges do at 
some point in their academic careers--drop out.<p>




I sense a certain caving-in of hope in America that problems of race can 
be solved. Since the sixties, when race relations held promise for the 
dawning of a new era, the issue has become one whose persistence causes 
"problem fatigue"--resignation to an unwanted condition of life.<p>

This fatigue, I suspect, deadens us to the deepening crisis in the 
education of black Americans. One can enter any desegregated school in 
America, from grammar school to high school to graduate or professional 
school, and meet a persistent reality: blacks and whites in largely 
separate worlds. And if one asks a few questions or looks at a few 
records, another reality emerges: these worlds are not equal, either in 
the education taking place there or in the achievement of the students who 
occupy them.<p>

As a social scientist, I know that the crisis has enough possible causes 
to give anyone problem fatigue. But at a personal level, perhaps because 
of my experience as a black in American schools, or perhaps just as the 
hunch of a myopic psychologist, I have long suspected a particular 
culprit--a culprit that can undermine black achievement as effectively as 
a lock on a schoolhouse door. The culprit I see is stigma, the endemic 
devaluation many blacks face in our society and schools. This status is 
its own condition of life, different from class, money, culture. It is 
capable, in the words of the late sociologist Erving Goffman, of "breaking 
the claim" that one's human attributes have on people. I believe that its 
connection to school achievement among black Americans has been vastly 
underappreciated.<p>

This is a troublesome argument, touching as it does on a still unhealed 
part of American race relations. But it leads us to a heartening 
principle: if blacks are made less racially vulnerable in school, they can 
overcome even substantial obstacles. Before the good news, though, I must 
at least sketch in the bad: the worsening crisis in the education of black 
Americans.<p>

Despite their socioeconomic disadvantages as a group, blacks begin school 
with test scores that are fairly close to the test scores of whites their 
age. The longer they stay in school, however, the more they fall behind; 
for example, by the sixth grade blacks in many school districts are two 
full grade levels behind whites in achievement. This pattern holds true in 
the middle class nearly as much as in the lower class. The record does not 
improve in high school. In 1980, for example, 25,500 minority students, 
largely black and Hispanic, entered high school in Chicago. Four years 
later only 9,500 graduated, and of those only 2,000 could read at grade 
level. The situation in other cities is comparable.<p>

Even for blacks who make it to college, the problem doesn't go away. As I 
noted, 70 percent of all black students who enroll in four-year colleges 
drop out at some point, as compared with 45 percent of whites. At any 
given time nearly as many black males are incarcerated as are in college 
in this country. And the grades of black college students average half a 
letter below those of their white classmates. At one prestigious 
university I recently studied, only 18 percent of the graduating black 
students had grade averages of B or above, as compared with 64 percent of 
the whites. This pattern is the rule, not the exception, in even the most 
elite American colleges. Tragically, low grades can render a degree 
essentially "terminal" in the sense that they preclude further schooling.<p>

Blacks in graduate and professional schools face a similarly worsening or 
stagnating fate. For example, from 1977 to 1990, though the number of 
Ph.D.s awarded to other minorities increased and the number awarded to 
whites stayed roughly the same, the number awarded to American blacks 
dropped from 1,116 to 828. And blacks needed more time to get those 
degrees.<p>

Standing ready is a familiar set of explanations. First is societal 
disadvantage. Black Americans have had, and continue to have, more than 
their share: a history of slavery, segregation, and job ceilings; 
continued lack of economic opportunity; poor schools; and the related 
problems of broken families, drug-infested communities, and social 
isolation. Any of these factors--alone, in combination, or through 
accumulated effects--can undermine school achievement. Some analysts point 
also to black American culture, suggesting that, hampered by disadvantage, 
it doesn't sustain the values and expectations critical to education, or 
that it fosters learning orientations ill suited to school achievement, or 
that it even "opposes" mainstream achievement. These are the chestnuts, 
and I had always thought them adequate. Then several facts emerged that 
just didn't seem to fit.<p>

For one thing, the achievement deficits occur even when black students 
suffer no major financial disadvantage--among middle-class students on 
wealthy college campuses and in graduate school among black students 
receiving substantial financial aid. For another thing, survey after 
survey shows that even poor black Americans value education highly, often 
more than whites. Also, as I will demonstrate, several programs have 
improved black school achievement without addressing culturally specific 
learning orientations or doing anything to remedy socioeconomic 
disadvantage.<p>

Neither is the problem fully explained, as one might assume, by deficits 
in skill or preparation which blacks might suffer because of background 
disadvantages. I first doubted that such a connection existed when I saw 
flunk-out rates for black and white students at a large, prestigious 
university. Two observations surprised me. First, for both blacks and 
whites the level of preparation, as measured by Scholastic Aptitude Test 
scores, didn't make much difference in who flunked out; low scorers (with 
combined verbal and quantitative SATs of 800) were no more likely to flunk 
out than high scorers (with combined SATs of 1,200 to 1,500). The second 
observation was racial: whereas only two percent to 11 percent of the 
whites flunked out, 18 percent to 33 percent of the blacks flunked out, 
even at the highest levels of preparation (combined SATs of 1,400). Dinesh 
D'Souza has argued recently that college affirmative-action programs cause 
failure and high dropout rates among black students by recruiting them to 
levels of college work for which they are inadequately prepared. That was 
clearly not the case at this school; black students flunked out in large 
numbers even with preparation well above average.<p>

And, sadly, this proved the rule, not the exception. From elementary 
school to graduate school, something depresses black achievement at every 
level of preparation, even the highest. Generally, of course, the better 
prepared achieve better than the less prepared, and this is about as true 
for blacks as for whites. But given any level of school preparation (as 
measured by tests and earlier grades), blacks somehow achieve less in 
subsequent schooling than whites (that is, have poorer grades, have lower 
graduation rates, and take longer to graduate), no matter how strong that 
preparation is. Put differently, the same achievement level requires 
better preparation for blacks than for whites--far better: among students 
with a C+ average at the university I just described, the mean American 
College Testing Program (ACT) score for blacks was at the 98th percentile, 
while for whites it was at only the 34th percentile. This pattern has been 
documented so broadly across so many regions of the country, and by so 
many investigations (literally hundreds), that it is virtually a social 
law in this society--as well as a racial tragedy.<p>

Clearly; something is missing from our understanding of black 
underachievement. Disadvantage contributes, yet blacks underachieve even 
when they have ample resources, strongly value education, and are prepared 
better than adequately in terms of knowledge and skills. Something else 
has to be involved. That something else could be of just modest 
importance--a barrier that simply adds its effect to that of other 
disadvantages--or it could be pivotal, such that were it corrected, other 
disadvantages would lose their effect.<p>




That something else, I believe, has to do with the process of identifying 
with school. I offer a personal example:<p>

I remember conducting experiments with my research adviser early in 
graduate school and awaiting the results with only modest interest. I 
struggled to meet deadlines. The research enterprise--the core of what one 
does as a social psychologist--just wasn't ME yet. I was in school for 
other reasons--I wanted an advanced degree, I was vaguely ambitious for 
intellectual work, and being in graduate school made my parents proud of 
me. But as time passed, I began to like the work. I also began to grasp 
the value system that gave it meaning, and the faculty treated me as if 
they thought I might even be able to do it. Gradually I began to think of 
myself as a social psychologist. With this change in self-concept came a 
new accountability; my self-esteem was affected now by what I did as a 
social psychologist, something that hadn't been true before. This added a 
new motivation to my work; self-respect, not just parental respect, was on 
the line. I noticed changes in myself. I worked without deadlines. I bored 
friends with applications of arcane theory to their daily lives. I went to 
conventions. I lived and died over how experiments came out.<p>

Before this transition one might have said that I was handicapped by my 
black working-class background and lack of motivation. After the 
transition the same observer might say that even though my background was 
working-class, I had special advantages: achievement-oriented parents, a 
small and attentive college. But these facts alone would miss the 
importance of the identification process I had experienced: the change in 
self-definition and in the activities on which I based my self-esteem. 
They would also miss a simple condition necessary for me to make this 
identification: treatment as a valued person with good prospects.<p>

I believe that the "something else" at the root of black achievement 
problems is the failure of American schooling to meet this simple 
condition for many of its black students. Doing well in school requires a 
belief that school achievement can be a promising basis of self-esteem, 
and that belief needs constant reaffirmation even for advantaged students. 
Tragically, I believe, the lives of black Americans are still haunted by a 
specter that threatens this belief and the identification that derives 
from it at every level of schooling.<p>



<b>THE SPECTER OF STIGMA AND RACIAL VULNERABILITY</b><p>

I have a good friend, the mother of three, who spends considerable time in 
the public school classrooms of Seattle, where she lives. In her son's 
third-grade room, managed by a teacher of unimpeachable good will and 
competence, she noticed over many visits that the extraordinary art work 
of a small black boy named Jerome was ignored--or, more accurately 
perhaps, its significance was ignored. As genuine art talent has a way of 
doing--even in the third grade--his stood out. Yet the teacher seemed 
hardly to notice. Moreover, Jerome's reputation, as it was passed along 
from one grade to the
next, included only the slightest mention of his talent. Now, of course, 
being ignored like this could happen to anyone--such is the overload in 
our public schools. But my friend couldn't help wondering how the school 
would have responded to this talent had the artist been one of
her own, middle-class white children.<p>

Terms like "prejudice" and "racism" often miss the full scope of racial 
devaluation in our society, implying as they do that racial devaluation 
comes primarily from the strongly prejudiced, not from "good people" like 
Jerome's teacher. But the prevalence of racists--deplorable though racism 
is--misses the full extent of Jerome's burden, perhaps even the most 
profound part.<p>

He faces a devaluation that grows out of our images of society and the way 
those images catalogue people. The catalogue need never be taught. It is 
implied by all we see around us: the kinds of people revered in 
advertising (consider the unrelenting racial advocacy of Ralph Lauren ads) 
and movies (black women are rarely seen as romantic partners, for 
example); media discussions of whether a black can be President; 
invitation lists to junior high school birthday parties; school curricula; 
literary and musical canons. These details create an image of society in 
which black Americans simply do not fare well. When I was a kid, we 
captured it with the saying "If you're white you're right, if you're 
yellow you're mellow, if you're brown stick around, but if you're black 
get back."<p>

In ways that require no fueling from strong prejudice or stereotypes, 
these images expand the devaluation of black Americans. They act as mental 
standards against which information about blacks is evaluated: that which 
fits these images we accept; that which contradicts them we suspect. Had 
Jerome had a reading problem, which fits these images, it might have been 
accepted as characteristic more readily than his extraordinary art work, 
which contradicts them.<p>

These images do something else as well, something especially pernicious in 
the classroom. They set up a jeopardy of double devaluation for blacks, a 
jeopardy that does not apply to whites. Like anyone, blacks risk 
devaluation for a particular incompetence, such as a failed test or a 
flubbed pronunciation. But they further risk that such performances will 
confirm the broader, racial inferiority they are suspected of. Thus, from 
the first grade through graduate school, blacks have the extra fear that 
in the eyes of those around them their full humanity could fall with a 
poor answer or a mistaken stroke of the pen.<p>

Moreover, because these images are conditioned in all of us, collectively 
held, they can spawn racial devaluation in all of us, not just in the 
strongly prejudiced. They can do this even in blacks themselves: a 
majority of black children recently tested said they like and prefer to 
play with white rather than black dolls--almost fifty years after Kenneth 
and Mamie Clark, conducting similar experiments, documented identical 
findings and so paved the way for Brown v. Topeka Board of Education. Thus 
Jerome's devaluation can come from a circle of people in his world far 
greater than the expressly prejudiced--a circle that apparently includes 
his teacher.<p>

In ways often too subtle to be conscious but sometimes overt, I believe, 
blacks remain devalued in American schools, where, for example, a recent 
national survey shows that through high school they are still more than 
twice as likely as white children to receive corporal punishment, be 
suspended from school, or be labeled mentally retarded.<p>

Tragically, such devaluation can seem inescapable. Sooner or later it 
forces on its victims two painful realizations. The first is that society 
is preconditioned to see the worst in them. Black students quickly learn 
that acceptance, if it is to be won at all, will be hard-won. The second 
is that even if a black student achieves exoneration in one setting--with 
the teacher and fellow students in one classroom, or at one level of 
schooling, for example--this approval will have to be rewon in the next 
classroom, at the next level of schooling. Of course, individual 
characteristics that enhance one's value in society--skills, class status, 
appearance, and success--can diminish the racial devaluation one faces. 
And sometimes the effort to prove oneself fuels achievement. But few from 
any group could hope to sustain so daunting and everlasting a struggle. 
Thus, I am afraid, too many black students are left hopeless and deeply 
vulnerable in America's classrooms.<p>

<b>"DISIDENTIFYING" WITH SCHOOL</b><p>

I believe that in significant part the crisis in black Americans' 
education stems from the power of this vulnerability to undercut 
identification with schooling, either before it happens or after it has 
bloomed.<p>

Jerome is an example of the first kind. At precisely the time when he 
would need to see school as a viable source of self-esteem, his teachers 
fail to appreciate his best work. The devalued status of his race devalues 
him and his work in the classroom. Unable to entrust his sense of himself 
to this place, he resists measuring himself against its values and goals. 
He languishes there, held by the law, perhaps even by his parents, but not 
allowing achievement to affect his view of himself. This psychic 
alienation--the act of not caring--makes him less vulnerable to the 
specter of devaluation that haunts him. Bruce Hare, an educational 
researcher, has documented this process among fifth-grade boys in several 
schools in Champaign, Illinois. He found that although the black boys had 
considerably lower achievement-test scores than their white classmates, 
their overall self-esteem was just as high. This stunning imperviousness 
to poor academic performance was accomplished, he found, by their 
de-emphasizing school achievement as a basis of self-esteem and giving 
preference to peer-group relations--a domain in which their esteem 
prospects were better. They went where they had to go to feel good about 
themselves.<p>

But recall the young student whose mentor I was. She had already 
identified with school, and wanted to be a doctor. How can racial 
vulnerability break so developed an achievement identity? To see, let us 
follow her steps onto campus: Her recruitment and admission stress her 
minority status perhaps more strongly than it has been stressed at any 
other time in her life. She is offered academic and social support 
services, further implying that she is "at risk" (even though, contrary to 
common belief, the vast majority of black college students are admitted 
with qualifications well above the threshold for whites). Once on campus, 
she enters a socially circumscribed world in which blacks--still largely 
separate from whites--have lower status; this is reinforced by a 
sidelining of minority material and interests in the curriculum and in 
university life. And she can sense that everywhere in this new world her 
skin color places her under suspicion of intellectual inferiority. All of 
this gives her the double vulnerability I spoke of: she risks confirming a 
particular incompetence, at chemistry or a foreign language, for example; 
but she also risks confirming the racial inferiority she is suspected 
of--a judgment that can feel as close at hand as a mispronounced word or 
an ungrammatical sentence. In reaction, usually to some modest setbacks 
she withdraws, hiding her troubles from instructors, counselors, even 
other students. Quickly, I believe, a psychic defense takes over. She 
disidentifies with achievement; she changes her self-conception, her 
outlook and values, so that achievement is no longer so important to her 
self-esteem. She may continue to feel pressure to stay in school--from her 
parents, even from the potential advantages of a college degree. But now 
she is psychologically insulated from her academic life, like a 
disinterested visitor. Cool, unperturbed. But, like a painkilling drug, 
disidentification undoes her future as it relieves her vulnerability.<p>

The prevalence of this syndrome among black college students has been 
documented extensively, especially on predominantly white campuses. 
Summarizing this work, Jacqueline Fleming, a psychologist, writes, "The 
fact that black students must matriculate in an atmosphere that feels 
hostile arouses defensive reactions that interfere with intellectual 
performance....They display academic demotivation and think less of their 
abilities. They profess losses of energy." Among a sample of blacks on one 
predominantly white campus, Richard Nisbett and Andrew Reaves, both 
psychologists, and I found that attitudes related to disidentification 
were more strongly predictive of grades than even academic preparation 
(that is, SATs and high school grades).<p>

To make matters worse, once disidentification occurs in a school, it can 
spread like the common cold. Blacks who identify and try to achieve 
embarrass the strategy by valuing the very thing the strategy denies the 
value of. Thus pressure to make it a group norm can evolve quickly and 
become fierce. Defectors are called "oreos" or "incognegroes." One's 
identity as an authentic black is held hostage, made incompatible with 
school identification. For black students, then, pressure to disidentify 
with school can come from the already demoralized as well as from racial 
vulnerability in the setting.<p>

Stigmatization of the sort suffered by black Americans is probably also a 
barrier to the school achievement of other groups in our society, such as 
lower-class whites, Hispanics, and women in male-dominated fields. For 
example, at a large midwestern university I studied, women match men's 
achievement in the liberal arts, where they suffer no marked stigma, but 
underachieve compared with men (get lower grades than men with the same 
ACT scores) in engineering and premedical programs, where they, like 
blacks across the board, are more vulnerable to suspicions of inferiority.<p>

<b>"WISE" SCHOOLING</b><p>

"When they approach me they see...everything and anything except 
me....[this] invisibility...occurs because of a peculiar disposition of 
the eyes...."<p>
                   --Ralph Ellison, Invisible Man<p>

Erving Goffman, borrowing from Gays of the 1950s, used the term "wise" to 
describe people who don't themselves bear the stigma of a given group but 
who are accepted by the group. These are people in whose eyes the full 
humanity of the stigmatized is visible, people in whose eyes they feel 
less vulnerable. If racial vulnerability undermines black school 
achievement, as I have argued, then this achievement should improve 
significantly if schooling is made "wise"--that is, made to see value and 
promise in black students and to act accordingly.<p>

And yet, although racial vulnerability at school may undermine black 
achievement, so many other factors seem to contribute--from the 
debilitations of poverty to the alleged dysfunctions of black American 
culture--that one might expect "wiseness" in the classroom to be of little 
help. Fortunately, we have considerable evidence to the contrary. Wise 
schooling may indeed be the missing key to the schoolhouse door.<p>

In the mid-seventies black students in Philip Uri Treisman's early 
calculus courses at the University of California at Berkeley consistently 
fell to the bottom of every class. To help, Treisman developed the 
Mathematics Workshop Program, which, in a surprisingly short time, 
reversed their fortunes, causing them to outperform their white and Asian 
counterparts. And although it is only a freshman program, black students 
who take it graduate at a rate comparable to the Berkeley average. Its 
central technique is group study of calculus concepts. But it is also 
wise; it does things that allay the racial vulnerabilities of these 
students. Stressing their potential to learn, it recruits them to a 
challenging "honors" workshop tied to their first calculus course. 
Building on their skills, the workshop gives difficult work, often beyond 
course content, to students with even modest preparation (some of their 
math SATs dip to the 300s). Working together, students soon understand 
that everyone knows something and nobody knows everything, and learning is 
speeded through shared understanding. The wisdom of these tactics is their 
subtext message: "You are valued in this program because of your academic 
potential--regardless of your current skill level. You have no more to 
fear than the next person, and since the work is difficult, success is a 
credit to your ability, and a setback is a reflection only of the 
challenge." The black students' double vulnerability around failure--the 
fear that they lack ability, and the dread that they will be devalued--is 
thus reduced. They can relax and achieve. The movie Stand and Deliver 
depicts Jaime Escalante using the same techniques of assurance and 
challenge to inspire advanced calculus performance in East Los Angeles 
Chicano high schoolers. And, explaining Xavier University's extraordinary 
success in producing black medical students, a spokesman said recently, 
"What doesn't work is saying, 'You need remedial work.' What does work is 
saying, 'You may be somewhat behind at this time but you're a talented 
person. We're going to help you advance at an accelerated rate.'"<p>

The work of James Comer, a child psychiatrist at Yale, suggests that 
wiseness can minimize even the barriers of poverty. Over a fifteen-year 
period he transformed the two worst elementary schools in New Haven, 
Connecticut, into the third and fifth best in the city's 
thirty-three-school system without any change in the type of 
students--largely poor and black. His guiding belief is that learning 
requires a strongly accepting relationship between teacher and student. 
"After all," he notes, "what is the difference between scribble and a 
letter of the alphabet to a child? The only reason the letter is 
meaningful, and worth learning and remembering, is because a MEANINGFUL 
other wants him or her to learn and remember it." To build these 
relationships Comer focuses on the overall school climate, shaping it not 
so much to transmit specific skills, or to achieve order per se, or even 
to improve achievement, as to establish a valuing and optimistic 
atmosphere in which a child can--to use his term--"identify" with 
learning. Responsibility for this lies with a team of ten to fifteen 
members, headed by the principal and made up of teachers, parents, school 
staff, and child-development experts (for example, psychologists or 
special-education teachers). The team develops a plan of specifics: 
teacher training, parent workshops, coordination of information about 
students. But at base I believe it tries to ensure that the 
students--vulnerable on so many counts--get treated essentially like 
middle-class students, with conviction about their value and promise. As 
this happens, their vulnerability diminishes, and with it the companion 
defenses of disidentification and misconduct. They achieve, and apparently 
identify, as their achievement gains persist into high school. Comer's 
genius, I believe, is to have recognized the importance of these 
vulnerabilities as barriers to INTELLECTUAL development, and the corollary 
that schools hoping to educate such students must learn first how to make 
them feel valued.<p>

These are not isolated successes. Comparable results were observed, for 
example, in a Comer-type program in Maryland's Prince Georges County, in 
the Stanford economist Henry Levin's accelerated-schools program, and in 
Harlem's Central Park East Elementary School, under the principalship of 
Deborah Meier. And research involving hundreds of programs and schools 
points to the same conclusion: black achievement is consistently linked to 
conditions of schooling that reduce racial vulnerability. These include 
relatively harmonious race relations among students; a commitment by 
teachers and schools to seeing minority-group members achieve; the 
instructional goal that students at all levels of preparation achieve; 
desegregation at the classroom as well as the school level; and a 
de-emphasis on ability tracking.<p>

That erasing stigma improves black achievement is perhaps the strongest 
evidence that stigma is what depresses it in the first place. This is no 
happy realization. But it lets in a ray of hope: whatever other factors 
also depress black achievement--poverty, social isolation, poor 
preparation--they may be substantially overcome in a schooling atmosphere 
that reduces racial and other vulnerabilities, not through unrelenting 
niceness or ferocious regimentation but by wiseness, by seeing value and 
acting on it.<p>

<b>WHAT MAKES SCHOOLING UNWISE</b><p>

But is wise schooling is so attainable, why is racial vulnerability the 
rule, not the exception, in American schooling?<p>

One factor is the basic assimilationist offer that schools make to blacks: 
You can be valued and rewarded in school (and society), the schools say to 
these students, but you must first master the culture and ways of the 
American mainstream, and since that mainstream (as it is represented) is 
essentially white, this means you must give up many particulars of being 
black--styles of speech and appearance, value priorities, preferences--at 
least in mainstream settings. This is asking a lot. But it has been the 
"color-blind" offer to every immigrant and minority group in our nation's 
history, the core of the melting-pot ideal, and so I think it strikes most 
of us as fair. Yet non-immigrant minorities like blacks and Native 
Americans have always been here, and thus are entitled, more than new 
immigrants, to participate in the defining images of the society projected 
in school. More important, their exclusion from these images denies their 
contributive history and presence in society. Thus, whereas immigrants can 
tilt toward assimilation in pursuit of the opportunities for which they 
came, American blacks may find it harder to assimilate. For them, the 
offer of acceptance in return for assimilation carries a primal insult: it 
asks them to join in something that has made them invisible.<p>

Now, I must be clear. This is not a criticism of Western civilization. My 
concern is an omission of image-work. In his incisive essay "What America 
Would Be Like Without Blacks," Ralph Ellison showed black influence on 
American speech and language, the themes of our finest literature, and our 
most defining ideals of personal freedom and democracy. In The World They 
Made Together, Mechal Sobel described how African and European influences 
shaped the early American South in everything from housing design and land 
use to religious expression. The fact is that blacks are not outside the 
American mainstream but, in Ellison's words, have always been "one of its 
major tributaries." Yet if one relied on what is taught in America's 
schools, one would never know this. There blacks have fallen victim to a 
collective self-deception, a society's allowing itself to assimilate like 
mad from its constituent groups while representing itself to itself as if 
the assimilation had never happened, as if progress and good were almost 
exclusively Western and white. A prime influence of American society on 
world culture is the music of black Americans, shaping art forms from 
rock-and-roll to modern dance. Yet in American schools, from kindergarten 
through graduate school, these essentially black influences have barely 
peripheral status, are largely outside the canon. Thus it is not what is 
taught but what is not taught, what teachers and professors have never 
learned the value of, that reinforces a fundamental unwiseness in American 
schooling, and keeps black disidentification on full boil.<p>

Deep in the psyche of American educators is a presumption that black 
students need academic remediation, or extra time with elemental curricula 
to overcome background deficits. This orientation guides many efforts to 
close the achievement gap--from grammar school tutoring to college 
academic-support programs--but I fear it can be unwise. Bruno Bettelheim 
and Karen Zelan's article "Why Children Don't Like to Read" comes to mind: 
apparently to satisfy the changing sensibilities of local school boards 
over this century, many books that children like were dropped from school 
reading lists; when children's reading scores also dropped, the approved 
texts were replaced by simpler books; and when reading scores dropped 
again, these were replaced by even simpler books, until eventually the 
children could hardly read at all, not because the material was too 
difficult but because they were bored stiff. So it goes, I suspect, with a 
great many of these remediation efforts. Moreover, because so many such 
programs target blacks primarily, they virtually equate black identity 
with substandard intellectual status, amplifying racial vulnerability. 
They can even undermine students' ability to gain confidence from their 
achievement, by sharing credit for their successes while implying that 
their failures stem from inadequacies beyond the reach of remediation.<p>

The psychologist Lisa Brown and I recently uncovered evidence of just how 
damaging this orientation may be. At a large, prestigious university we 
found that whereas the grades of black graduates of the 1950s improved 
during the students' college years until they virtually matched the school 
average, those of blacks who graduated in the 1980s (we chose only those 
with above-average entry credentials, to correct for more-liberal 
admissions policies in that decade) worsened, ending up considerably below 
the school average. The 1950s graduates faced outward discrimination in 
everything from housing to the classroom, whereas the 1980s graduates were 
supported by a phalanx of help programs. Many things may contribute to 
this pattern. The Jackie Robinson, "pioneer" spirit of the 1950s blacks 
surely helped them endure. And in a pre-affirmative-action era, they may 
have been seen as intellectually more deserving. But one cannot ignore the 
distinctive fate of 1980s blacks: a remedial orientation put their 
abilities under suspicion, deflected their ambitions, distanced them from 
their successes, and painted them with their failures. Black students on 
today's campuses may experience far less overt prejudice than their 1950s 
counterparts but, ironically, may be more racially vulnerable.<p>



<b>THE ELEMENTS OF WISENESS</b><p>

For too many black students school is simply the place where, more 
concertedly, persistently, and authoritatively than anywhere else in 
society, they learn how little valued they are.<p>

Clearly, no simple recipe can fix this, but I believe we now understand 
the basics of a corrective approach. Schooling must focus more on reducing 
the vulnerabilities that block identification with achievement. I believe 
that four conditions, like the legs of a stool, are fundamental.<p>

* If what is meaningful and important to a teacher is to become meaningful 
and important to a student, the student must feel valued by the teacher 
for his or her potential and as a person. Among the more fortunate in 
society, this relationship is often taken for granted. But it is precisely 
the relationship that race can still undermine in American society. As 
Comer, Escalante, and Treisman have shown, when one's students bear race 
and class vulnerabilities, building this relationship is the first order 
of business--at all levels of schooling. No tactic of instruction, no 
matter how ingenious, can succeed without it.<p>

* The challenge and the promise of personal fulfillment, not remediation 
(under whatever guise), should guide the education of these students. 
Their present skills should be taken into account, and they should be 
moved along at a pace that is demanding but doesn't defeat them. Their 
ambitions should never be scaled down but should instead be guided to 
inspiring goals even when extraordinary dedication is called for. 
Frustration will be less crippling than alienation. Here psychology is 
everything: remediation defeats, challenge strengthens--affirming their 
potential, crediting them with their achievements, inspiring them.<p>

But the first condition, I believe, cannot work without the second, and 
vice versa. A valuing teacher-student relationship goes nowhere without 
challenge, and challenge will always be resisted outside a valuing 
relationship. (Again, I must be careful about something: in criticizing 
remediation I am not opposing affirmative-action recruitment in the 
schools. The success of this policy, like that of school integration 
before it, depends, I believe, on the tactics of implementation. Where 
students are valued and challenged, they generally succeed.)<p>

* Racial integration is a generally useful element in this design, if not 
a necessity. Segregation, whatever its purpose, draws out group 
differences and makes people feel more vulnerable when they inevitably 
cross group lines to compete in the larger society. This vulnerability, I 
fear, can override confidence gained in segregated schooling unless that 
confidence is based on strongly competitive skills and 
knowledge--something that segregated schooling, plagued by shortages of 
resources and access, has difficulty producing.<p>

* The particulars of black life and culture--art, literature, political 
and social perspective, music--must be presented in the mainstream 
curriculum of American schooling, not consigned to special days, weeks, or 
even months of the year, or to special-topic courses and programs aimed 
essentially at blacks. Such channeling carries the disturbing message that 
the material is not of general value. And this does two terrible things: 
it wastes the power of this material to alter our images of the American 
mainstream--continuing to frustrate black identification with it--and it 
excuses in whites and others a huge ignorance of their own society. The 
true test of democracy, Ralph Ellison has said, "is...the inclusion--not 
assimilation--of the black man."<p>

Finally, if I might be allowed a word specifically to black parents, one 
issue is even more immediate: our children may drop out of school before 
the first committee meets to accelerate the curriculum. Thus, although we, 
along with all Americans, must strive constantly for wise schooling, I 
believe we cannot wait for it. We cannot yet forget our essentially heroic 
challenge: to foster in our children a sense of hope and entitlement to 
mainstream American life and schooling, even when it devalues them.<p>

<blockquote>

	<i><font size=4>Marijuana has not been de facto legalized, and the war on drugs is not just

about cocaine and heroin. In fact, today, when we don't have enough jail cells

for murderers, rapists, and other violent criminals, there may be more people

in federal and state prisons for marijuana offenses than at any other time in

U.S. history</i></font><p>

	

	

	<pre>

	

	</pre>

	

	<font size=5>I</font>n the state of Indiana a person convicted of armed robbery will serve about

five years in prison; someone convicted of rape will serve about twelve; and a

convicted murderer can expect to spend twenty years behind bars. These figures

are actually higher than the figures nationwide: eight years and eight months

in prison is the average punishment for an American found guilty of murder. The

prison terms given by Indiana judges tend to be long, but with good behavior an

inmate will serve no more than half the nominal sentence. Those facts are worth

keeping in mind when considering the case of Mark Young. At the age of

thirty-eight Young was arrested at his Indianapolis home for brokering the sale

of 700 pounds of marijuana grown on a farm in nearby Morgan County. Young was

tried and convicted under federal law. He had never before been charged with

drug trafficking. He had no history of violent crime. Young's role in the

illegal transaction had been that of a middleman--he never distributed the

drugs; he simply introduced two people hoping to sell a large amount of

marijuana to three people wishing to buy it. The offense occurred a year and a

half prior to his arrest. No confiscated marijuana, money, or physical evidence

of any kind linked Young to the crime. He was convicted solely on the testimony

of co-conspirators who were now cooperating with the government. On February 8,

1992, Mark Young was sentenced by Judge Sarah Evans Barker to life imprisonment

without possibility of parole.<p>



<p>



There was so much talk in the 1970s about the decriminalization of marijuana,

and the smoking of marijuana is so casually taken for granted in much of our

culture, that many people assume that a marijuana offense these days will

rarely lead to a prison term. But in fact there may be more people in prison

today for violating marijuana laws than at any other time in the nation's

history. Calculations based on data provided by the Bureau of Prisons and the

United States Sentencing Commission suggest that one of every six inmates in

the federal prison system--roughly 15,000 people--has been incarcerated

primarily for a marijuana offense. The number currently being held in state

prisons and local jails is more difficult to estimate; a conservative guess

would be an additional 20,000 to 30,000. And Mark Young's sentence, though

unusual, is by no means unique. A dozen or more marijuana offenders may now be

serving life sentences in federal penitentiaries without hope of parole; if one

includes middle-aged inmates with sentences of twenty or thirty or forty years,

the number condemned to die in prison may reach into the hundreds. Other

inmates--no one knows how many--are serving life sentences in state

correctional facilities across the country for growing, selling, or even

possessing marijuana.<p>



<p>



The phrase "war on drugs" evokes images of Colombian cartels and inner-city

crack addicts. In many ways that is a misperception. Marijuana is and has long

been the most widely used illegal drug in the United States. It is used here

more frequently than all other illegal drugs combined. According to

conservative estimates, one third of the American population over the age of

eleven has smoked marijuana at least once. More than 17 million Americans

smoked it in 1992. At least three million smoke it on a daily basis. Unlike

heroin or cocaine, which must be imported, anywhere from a quarter to half of

the marijuana used in this country is grown here as well. Although popular

stereotypes depict marijuana growers as aging hippies in northern California or

Hawaii, the majority of the marijuana now cultivated in the United States is

being grown in the nation's midsection--a swath running roughly from the

Appalachians west to the Great Plains. Throughout this Marijuana Belt drug

fortunes are being made by farmers who often seem to have stepped from a page

of the old Saturday Evening Post. The value of America's annual marijuana crop

is staggering: plausible estimates start at $4 billion and range up to $24

billion. In 1993 the value of the nation's largest legal cash crop, corn, was

roughly $16 billion.<p>



<p>



Marijuana has well-organized supporters who campaign for its legalization and

promote its use through books, magazines, and popular music. They regard

marijuana as not only a benign recreational drug but also a form of herbal

medicine and a product with industrial applications. Marijuana's opponents are

equally passionate and far better organized. They consider marijuana a

dangerous drug--one that harms the user's mental, physical, and spiritual

well-being, promotes irresponsible sexual behavior, and encourages disrespect

for traditional values. At the heart of the ongoing bitter debate is a hardy

weed that can grow wild in all fifty states. The two sides agree that countless

lives have been destroyed by marijuana, but disagree about what should be

blamed: the plant itself, or the laws forbidding its use.<p>



<p>



The war on drugs embraced by President Ronald Reagan began largely as a

campaign against marijuana organized by conservative parents' groups in the

late 1970s. After more than a decade in which penalties for marijuana offenses

had been reduced at both the state and federal levels, the laws regarding

marijuana were made much tougher in the 1980s. More resources were devoted to

their enforcement, and punishments more severe than those administered during

the "reefer madness" of the 1930s became routine. All the legal tools commonly

associated with the fight against heroin and cocaine trafficking--civil

forfeitures, enhanced police search powers, the broad application of conspiracy

laws, a growing reliance on the testimony of informers, and mechanistic

sentencing formulas, such as mandatory minimums and "three strikes, you're

out"--have been employed against marijuana offenders. The story of how Mark

Young got a life sentence reveals a great deal about the emergence of the

American heartland as the region where a vast amount of the nation's marijuana

is now grown; about the changing composition of the federal prison population;

and about the effects of the war on drugs, a dozen years after its declaration,

throughout America's criminal-justice system. Underlying Young's tale is a

simple question: How does a society come to punish a person more harshly for

selling marijuana than for killing someone with a gun? <p>



<BR>



<font size=4><b>The Plant in Question</font></b><p>



<p>



<font size=5>"M</font>ARIJUANA" is the Mexican colloquial name for a plant known to botanists as

Cannabis sativa. In various forms it has long been familiar throughout the

world: in Africa as "dagga," in China as "ma," in Northern Europe as "hemp."

Although cannabis most likely originated in the steppes of central Asia, it now

thrives in almost any climate, spreading like milkweed or thistle, crowding out

neighboring grasses and reaching heights of three to twenty feet at maturity.

Marijuana has been cultivated for at least 5,000 years; it is one of the oldest

agricultural commodities not grown for food. The stalks of the plant contain

fibers that have been woven for millennia to make rope, canvas, and paper.

Cannabis is dioecious, spawning male and female plants in equal proportion. The

flowering buds of the female--and to a lesser extent those of the male--secrete

a sticky yellow resin rich with cannabinoids, the more than sixty compounds

unique to marijuana. Several of them are psychoactive, most prominently

delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).<p>



<p>



Lester Grinspoon, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical

School, believes that marijuana will someday be hailed as a "miracle drug," one

that is safe, inexpensive, and versatile. In his book Marihuana, the Forbidden

Medicine (1993) Grinspoon provides anecdotal evidence that smoking marijuana

can relieve the nausea associated with chemotherapy, prevent blindness induced

by glaucoma, serve as an appetite stimulant for AIDS patients, act as an

anti-epileptic, ward off asthma attacks and migraine headaches, alleviate

chronic pain, and reduce the muscle spasticity that accompanies multiple

sclerosis, cerebral palsy, and paraplegia. Other doctors think that Grinspoon

is wildly optimistic, and that no "crude drug" like marijuana--composed of more

than 400 chemicals--should be included in the modern pharmacopoeia. They point

out that effective synthetic drugs, of precise dosage and purity, have been

developed for every one of marijuana's potential uses. Dronabinol, a synthetic

form of delta-9-THC, has been available for years, though some clinical

oncologists find it inferior to marijuana as an anti-nausea agent. There have

been remarkably few large-scale studies that might verify or disprove

Grinspoon's claims. Nevertheless, thirty-six states allow the medicinal use of

marijuana, and eight patients are currently receiving it from the Public Health

Service. According to Grinspoon, the federal government has always been far

more interested in establishing marijuana's harmful effects than in discovering

any of its benefits, while major drug companies have little incentive to fund

expensive research on marijuana. As Grinspoon explains, "You cannot patent this

plant."<p>



<p>



The long-term health effects of chronic marijuana use, and marijuana's role as

a "gateway" to the use of other illegal drugs, are issues surrounded by great

controversy. Marijuana does not create a physical dependence in its users, but

it does create a psychological dependence in some. People who smoke marijuana

are far more likely to experiment later with other psychoactive drugs, but no

direct cause-and-effect relationship has ever been established. Delta-9-THC is

highly lipid-soluble and has a half-life of five days, which means that it

diffuses widely throughout the human body and remains there for quite some

time: an occasional user can fail a urine test three days after smoking a

single joint, and a heavy user may test positive after abstaining from

marijuana for more than a month. Delta-9-THC's persistence within various cells

and vital organs (also a characteristic of Valium, Thorazine, and quinine)

suggests that it could have the ability to exert subtly harmful effects; few

have yet been proved. Studies of lifelong heavy marijuana users in Jamaica,

Greece, and Costa Rica reveal little psychological or physiological damage.

Much more research, however, needs to be done in the areas of cognition,

reproduction, and immunology. Adolescent users in particular would be at risk

if marijuana were found to have pernicious systemic effects. Some studies have

shown that short-term memory deficiencies in heavy smokers, though reversible,

may endure long after the cessation of marijuana use. Other studies have

demonstrated in vitro and in laboratory animals that marijuana may have a mild

immunosuppressive effect, but no study has conclusively linked delta-9-THC to

immune-system changes in human beings. Well-publicized horror stories from the

1970s--that marijuana kills brain cells, damages chromosomes, and prompts men

to grow breasts--were based on faulty research.<p>



<p>



Smoking marijuana does seem to damage the pulmonary system, in some of the ways

that inhaling tobacco smoke does. In a study of people who have smoked four or

five joints a day for more than ten years, the physician Donald P. Tashkin, of

the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center, has found

substantial evidence that marijuana smoke can cause chronic bronchitis, changes

in cells of the central airway which are potentially pre-cancerous, and an

impairment in scavenger-cell function which could lead to a risk of respiratory

infection. A joint seems to deliver four times as much carcinogenic tar as a

tobacco cigarette of the same size. Tashkin expects that some heavy marijuana

users will eventually suffer cancers of the mouth, throat, and lungs, although

none of his research subjects has yet developed a malignancy. Oddly enough, the

more potent strains of marijuana may prove less dangerous, since less of them

needs to be smoked.<p>



<p>



There is much less disagreement about the short-term health effects of

marijuana. According to the physician Leo Hollister, a former president of the

American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, who now teaches at the University

of Texas, the occasional use of marijuana by a healthy adult poses no greater

risks than the moderate consumption of alcohol. For a variety of reasons,

however, marijuana should not be smoked by schizophrenics, pregnant women, and

people with heart conditions. Although the misuse of over-the-counter

medications such as aspirin, acetaminophen, and antihistamines each year kills

hundreds of Americans, not a single death has ever been credibly attributed

directly to smoking or consuming marijuana in the 5,000 years of the plant's

recorded use. Marijuana is one of the few therapeutically active substances

known to man for which there is no well-defined fatal dose. It has been

estimated that a person would have to smoke a hundred pounds of marijuana a

minute for fifteen minutes in order to induce a lethal response.<p>

<font size=4><b>Criminalized, Decriminalized, Recriminalized</font></b><p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE first American law pertaining to marijuana, passed by the Virginia Assembly

in 1619, required every farmer to grow it. Hemp was deemed not only a valuable

commodity but also a strategic necessity; its fibers were used to make sails

and riggings, and its by-products were transformed into oakum for the caulking

of wooden ships. Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland eventually allowed hemp

to be exchanged as legal tender, in order to stimulate its production and

relieve Colonial money shortages. Although a number of the Founding Fathers,

including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, later grew hemp on their

estates, there is no evidence that they were aware of the plant's psychoactive

properties. The domestic production of hemp flourished, especially in Kentucky,

until after the Civil War, when it was replaced by imports from Russia and by

other domestic materials. In the latter half of the nineteenth century

marijuana became a popular ingredient in patent medicines and was sold openly

at pharmacies in one-ounce herbal packages and in alcohol-based tinctures as a

cure for migraines, rheumatism, and insomnia.<p>



<p>



The political upheaval in Mexico that culminated in the Revolution of 1910 led

to a wave of Mexican immigration to states throughout the American Southwest.

The prejudices and fears that greeted these peasant immigrants also extended to

their traditional means of intoxication: smoking marijuana. Police officers in

Texas claimed that marijuana incited violent crimes, aroused a "lust for

blood," and gave its users "superhuman strength." Rumors spread that Mexicans

were distributing this "killer weed" to unsuspecting American schoolchildren.

Sailors and West Indian immigrants brought the practice of smoking marijuana to

port cities along the Gulf of Mexico. In New Orleans newspaper articles

associated the drug with African-Americans, jazz musicians, prostitutes, and

underworld whites. "The Marijuana Menace," as sketched by anti-drug

campaigners, was personified by inferior races and social deviants. In 1914 El

Paso, Texas, enacted perhaps the first U.S. ordinance banning the sale or

possession of marijuana; by 1931 twenty-nine states had outlawed marijuana,

usually with little fanfare or debate. Amid the rise of anti-immigrant

sentiment fueled by the Great Depression, public officials from the Southwest

and from Louisiana petitioned the Treasury Department to outlaw marijuana.

Their efforts were aided by a lurid propaganda campaign. "Murder Weed Found Up

and Down Coast," one headline warned; "Deadly Marijuana Dope Plant Ready For

Harvest That Means Enslavement of California Children." Harry J. Anslinger, the

commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, at first doubted the

seriousness of the problem and the need for federal legislation, but soon he

pursued the goal of a nationwide marijuana prohibition with enormous gusto. In

public appearances and radio broadcasts Anslinger asserted that the use of this

"evil weed" led to killings, sex crimes, and insanity. He wrote sensational

magazine articles with titles like "Marijuana: Assassin of Youth." In 1937

Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Act, effectively criminalizing the possession

of marijuana throughout the United States. A week after it went into effect, a

fifty-eight-year-old marijuana dealer named Samuel R. Caldwell became the first

person convicted under the new statute. Although marijuana offenders had been

treated leniently under state and local laws, Judge J. Foster Symes, of Denver,

lectured Caldwell on the viciousness of marijuana and sentenced him to four

hard years at Leavenworth Penitentiary.<p>



<p>



Harry J. Anslinger is a central figure in the history of American drug policy.

He headed the Federal Bureau of Narcotics from its inception through five

presidential Administrations spanning more than three decades. Anslinger had

much in common with his rival, J. Edgar Hoover. Both were conservative,

staunchly anti-communist proponents of law and order who imbued nascent federal

bureaus with their own idiosyncracies. Anslinger did not believe in a

public-health approach to drug addiction; he dismissed treatment clinics as

"morphine feeding stations" and "barrooms for addicts." In his view, strict

enforcement of the law was the only proper response to illegal drug use; he

urged judges to "jail offenders, then throw away the key." Anslinger's outlook

was consistent with that of most Americans, though his opinions proved more

resistant to new scientific evidence. When the New York Academy of

Medicine--after years of research--issued a report in 1944 concluding that

marijuana use did not cause violent behavior, provoke insanity, lead to

addiction, or promote opiate use, Anslinger angrily dismissed its authors as

"dangerous" and "strange."<p>



<p>



America's drug problem often seemed the work of foreign powers: during the

Second World War, Anslinger accused the Japanese of using narcotics to sap

America's will to fight; a few years later he asserted that Communists were

attempting the same ploy. The Boggs Act, passed by Congress at the height of

the McCarthy era, specified the same penalties for marijuana and heroin

offenses--two to five years in prison for first-time possession. As

justification for the long sentences contained in that act and in the Narcotic

Control Act, which followed in 1956, Anslinger stressed marijuana's crucial

role as a "stepping-stone" to narcotics addiction. Like Hoover, he maintained

dossiers on well-known entertainers whose behavior seemed un-American.

Anslinger disliked jazz and kept a special file, "Marijuana and Musicians,"

filled with reports on band members who played with Cab Calloway, Louis

Armstrong, Les Brown, Count Basie, Jimmy Dorsey, and Duke Ellington, among

others. For months Anslinger planned a nationwide roundup of popular

musicians--a scheme that was foiled by the inability of FBN agents to

infiltrate the jazz milieu. Although Anslinger's opposition to drug use was

both passionate and sincere, he made one notable exception. In his memoir, The

Murderers, Anslinger confessed to having arranged a regular supply of morphine

for "one of the most influential members of Congress," who had become an

addict. Anslinger's biographer believes that addict was Senator Joseph R.

McCarthy.<p>



<p>



By 1962, when Harry J. Anslinger retired, many states had passed "little Boggs

Acts" with penalties for marijuana possession or sale tougher than those

demanded by federal law. In Louisiana sentences for simple possession ranged

from five to ninety-nine years; in Missouri a second offense could result in a

life sentence; and in Georgia a second conviction for selling marijuana to

minors could bring the death penalty. As the political climate changed during

the 1960s, so did attitudes toward drug abuse. A series of commissions

appointed by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson repudiated some of

the basic assumptions that had guided marijuana policy for more than fifty

years, denying a direct link between the drug and violent crime or heroin use.

As marijuana use became widespread among white middle-class college students,

there was a reappraisal of marijuana laws that for decades had imprisoned poor

Mexicans and African-Americans without much public dissent. Drug-abuse policy

shifted from a purely criminal-justice approach to one also motivated by

interests of public health, with more emphasis on treatment than on punishment.

In 1970 the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act finally

differentiated marijuana from other narcotics and reduced federal penalties for

possession of small amounts. As directed by Congress, President Richard Nixon

appointed a bipartisan commission to study marijuana. In 1972 the Shafer

Commission issued its report, advocating the decriminalization of marijuana for

personal use--a recommendation that Nixon flatly rejected. Nevertheless, eleven

states, containing a third of the country's population, decriminalized

marijuana in the 1970s, and most other states weakened their laws against it.

President Jimmy Carter endorsed decriminalization, and it seemed that long

prison sentences for marijuana offenders had been consigned to the nation's

past.<p>



<p>



But they had not. One of the seminal events in the creation of the modern

American anti-drug movement was a backyard barbecue held in Atlanta, Georgia,

during August of 1976. In the aftermath of their daughter's birthday party, Ron

and Marsha Manatt combed through the wet grass in their pajamas, at one in the

morning, with flashlights, finding dozens of marijuana roaches, rolling-paper

packets, and empty bottles of Mad Dog 20/20 fortified wine discarded by their

twelve- and thirteen-year-old guests. Alarmed by these discoveries, the Manatts

gathered local parents in their living room and formed what was soon known as

the Nosy Parents Association, a group dedicated to preventing teenage drug use.

Marsha Manatt wrote to Robert DuPont, the head of the National Institute on

Drug Abuse; he helped arrange her introduction to Thomas Gleaton, a professor

of health education at Georgia State University. There soon arose the Parents'

Resource Institute for Drug Education and the National Federation of Parents

for Drug-Free Youth, two organizations backed by top officials at NIDA and the

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) which would exert tremendous influence on

the nation's drug policies. Thousands of other parents' groups soon formed

nationwide, and Ross Perot helped launch the Texans' War on Drugs.<p>



<p>



Marijuana use seemed epidemic: a survey in 1976 found that one out of twelve

high school seniors smoked pot on a daily basis. In the 1960s the youth

counterculture had celebrated marijuana's reputation as a drug for outcasts and

freaks. One Yippie leader had confidently predicted that the slogan of the

coming revolution would be "pot, freedom, license." The conservative parents'

groups took such words to heart and similarly invested marijuana with great

meaning. Robert DuPont, who at NIDA had once supported decriminalization, later

decried the "tumultuous change in values" among the young--their pursuit of

pleasure, their lack of responsibility to society--and argued that "the leading

edge of this cultural change was marijuana use."<p>



<p>



The election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency brought the war on drugs to the

White House. In June of 1982 President Reagan signed an executive order

creating a new post in his Administration--head of the White House Drug Abuse

Policy Office--and appointed a chemist, Carlton Turner, to the job. Turner had

for many years directed the Marijuana Research Project at the University of

Mississippi, running the government's only marijuana farm. Turner believed that

marijuana was an extremely dangerous drug--one that, among other things, might

have the power to induce homosexuality. In 1977 the DEA had acknowledged that

decriminalization was a policy worth considering; three years later it called

marijuana the most urgent drug problem facing the United States. Richard

Bonnie, a professor at the University of Virginia Law School who was an

influential member of the Shafer Commission staff, believes that advocates of

marijuana-law reform were pushed out of the mainstream by the growing stridency

and power of the parents' groups. Political moderates soon abandoned the issue.

Amid their silence, philosophies of "zero tolerance" and "user accountability"

revived the notion that what drug offenders deserved most was punishment. The

Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, and

the Anti-Drug Abuse Amendment Act of 1988 raised federal penalties for

marijuana possession, cultivation, and trafficking. Sentences were to be

determined by the quantity of the drug involved; "conspiracies" and "attempts"

were to be punished as severely as completed acts; and possession of a hundred

marijuana plants now carried the same sentence as possession of a hundred grams

of heroin.<p>



<BR>

<p>



<font size=5>M</font>ARIJUANA is currently classified as a Schedule I controlled substance,

implying that it has a high potential for abuse, no officially accepted

medicinal uses, and no safe level of use under medical supervision. Heroin,

LSD, and peyote are other Schedule I drugs; cocaine and phencyclidine (PCP) are

listed in Schedule II, allowing doctors to prescribe them. Under federal law it

is illegal to buy, sell, grow, or possess any amount of marijuana anywhere in

the United States. Penalties for a first offense range from probation to life

imprisonment, with fines of up to $4 million, depending on the quantity of

marijuana involved. Moreover, it is illegal to use the U.S. Postal Service or

other interstate shippers for the advertisement, import, or export of such

marijuana paraphernalia as roach clips, water pipes, and, in some instances,

cigarette papers--a crime that can lead to imprisonment and fines of up to

$100,000. Under civil-forfeiture statutes real estate, vehicles, cash,

securities, jewelry, and any other property connected with a marijuana offense

are subject to immediate seizure. The federal government need not prove that

the property was bought with the proceeds of illegal drug sales, only that it

was involved in the commission of a crime--that marijuana was grown on certain

land or transported in a particular vehicle. Property may be forfeited even

after a defendant has been found innocent of the offense, since the burden of

proof that applies to people--"beyond a reasonable doubt"--does not apply in

accusations against inanimate objects. Property can be forfeited without its

owner's ever being charged with a crime. On top of fines, incarceration, and

forfeiture, a convicted marijuana offender may face the revocation or denial of

more than 460 federal benefits, including student loans, small-business loans,

professional licenses, and farm subsidies. In international smuggling cases the

offender's passport can be revoked.<p>



<p>



State marijuana laws were also toughened during the 1980s and now vary

enormously. Some states classify marijuana with drugs like mescaline and

heroin, while others give it a separate legal category. In New York state

possessing slightly less than an ounce of marijuana brings a $100 fine, rarely

collected. In Nevada possessing any amount of marijuana is a felony. In Montana

selling a pound of marijuana, first offense, could lead to a life sentence,

whereas in New Mexico selling 10,000 pounds of marijuana, first offense, could

be punished with a prison term of no more than three years. In some states it

is against the law to be in a room where marijuana is being smoked, even if you

don't smoke any. In some states you may be subject to criminal charges if

someone else uses, distributes, or cultivates marijuana on your property. In

Idaho selling water pipes could lead to a prison sentence of nine years. In

Kentucky products made of hemp fibers, such as paper and clothing, not only are

illegal but carry the same penalties associated with an equivalent weight of

marijuana. In Arizona, where marijuana use is forbidden, the crime can be

established by the failure of a urine test: a person could theoretically be

prosecuted in Phoenix for a joint smoked in Philadelphia more than a week

before.<p>



<p>



Crossing an invisible state line with marijuana in your car can result in

vastly different punishments. If you are caught with three ounces of marijuana

in Union City, Ohio, you will probably be fined $100. But if you are caught in

the town of the same name literally across the road in Indiana, you could face

nine months to two years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000, a felony record,

suspension of your driver's license, forfeiture of your car, and charges of

marijuana possession, of possession with intent to distribute, and of

"maintaining a common nuisance" (for the criminal use of an automobile). That

one arrest in Indiana might cost you the $10,000 fine and at least $5,000 in

legal fees, plus the value of your forfeited car. Wide discrepancies in

punishment occur not just between states but also from county to county within

a given state. In La Salle County, Illinois, a first-time offender arrested

with 300 pounds of marijuana might be sentenced to four months in boot camp.

Sixty-five miles to the south, in McLean County, the same person convicted of

the same crime would more likely receive a prison sentence of four to eight

years.<p>



<p>



In 1992 more than 340,000 people were arrested nationwide for violating

marijuana laws. Almost three quarters of those arrests were for simple

possession, a crime that generally does not lead to incarceration. But

possession of more than an ounce--roughly equal to the amount of tobacco in a

pack of cigarettes--is in many states a felony. Conviction may lead to a few

months or a few years behind bars and the loss of a house or a job. People who

use marijuana as medicine must either buy it from drug dealers or grow it

themselves, often in violation of the law. James Cox, a cancer patient in St.

Louis, was found guilty of growing marijuana and sentenced to fifteen years in

prison; after the verdict both he and his wife attempted suicide. Orland

Foster, an AIDS patient in North Carolina, served fifteen months for growing

marijuana; one of his cellmates served less time for killing a woman. Now on

probation, Foster must either give up marijuana and risk losing weight, or

violate the terms of his release and risk going back to prison.<p>



<p>



In perhaps the most extraordinary case of this kind, Jim Montgomery, a

paraplegic immobilized from the waist down, who smoked marijuana to relieve

muscle spasms, was arrested in Sayre, Oklahoma, when sheriffs found two ounces

of pot in the pouch on the back of his wheelchair. Montgomery was tried and

convicted in 1992, by a jury, for possession of marijuana with intent to

distribute, for possession of paraphernalia, for unlawful possession of a

weapon during the commission of a crime (two handguns inherited from his

father, a police officer), and for maintaining a place resorted to by users of

controlled substances. His sentence was life in prison, plus sixteen years.

Both the judge and the local prosecutor were disturbed by the sentence chosen

by the jury; the judge subsequently reduced it to ten years. Montgomery spent

ten months in a prison medical unit, where he developed a life-threatening

infection, before being released on bond. His appeal is now pending. "I'll

never go back to that prison," he says. "I'd rather put a bullet in my head."

His case has already cost him more than $30,000 in legal fees. The government's

effort to seize Montgomery's home, shared with his widowed mother, proved

unsuccessful.<p>



<p>



Oklahoma today has a well-deserved reputation for being the worst place in the

United States to be caught with marijuana. On June 11, 1992, Larry Jackson, a

small-time crook with a lengthy record of nonviolent offenses, was arrested at

a friend's Tulsa apartment. On the floor near Jackson's right foot a police

officer noticed a minuscule amount of marijuana--0.16 of a gram, which is

0.005644 of an ounce. Jackson was charged with felony possession of marijuana,

convicted, and given a life sentence. In Oklahoma City, Leland James Dodd was

given two life sentences, plus ten years, for buying fifty pounds of marijuana

from undercover officers in a "reverse sting." Oklahoma is not alone in handing

out life sentences for buying marijuana from the government. In Tuscaloosa

County, Alabama, William Stephen Bonner, a truck driver, was sent away for life

without possibility of parole after state narcotics agents delivered forty

pounds of marijuana to his bedroom. Raymond Pope, a resident of Georgia, was

lured to Baldwin County, Alabama, in 1990 with promises of cheap marijuana; he

bought twenty-seven pounds from local sheriffs in a reverse sting, was

convicted, and was sentenced to life without possibility of parole. Pope's

criminal record consisted of prior convictions for stealing televisions and

bedspreads from Georgia motels. He is now imprisoned 400 miles from his family.

He has three young children.<p>



<p>



Although the penalties for buying, selling, or possessing marijuana are often

severe, the penalties for growing it can be even more severe. In Iowa

cultivating any amount can lead to a five-year prison sentence, in Colorado to

an eight-year sentence, in Missouri to a fifteen-year sentence. In the state of

Virginia the recommended punishment for growing a single marijuana plant is a

prison term of five to thirty years.<p>

<b><font size=4>A Farm in Morgan County</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>I</font>N November of 1988 Claude Atkinson and Ernest Montgomery met at a Denny's near

the airport in Indianapolis to discuss setting up a large-scale

marijuana-growing operation. Atkinson, a fifty-nine-year-old Indiana native,

was by all accounts charismatic and highly skilled at cultivating marijuana.

Ostensibly a used-farm-implements dealer, Atkinson had organized huge marijuana

farms in Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky. His knowledge of growing techniques

was much more impressive than his skill at eluding capture. In 1984

law-enforcement authorities had linked him to a pot farm in Paragon, Indiana;

the following year he was caught growing marijuana with artificial light in an

immense Indianapolis warehouse; and in 1987 a deer hunter stumbled upon

thousands of his marijuana plants in an Indiana field. Claude Atkinson had cut

a series of deals with the government, informing on others after each arrest

and serving brief terms in prison, where he recruited employees for future

ventures. Now fresh out of custody and broke, he was ready to get back into the

growing business. Ernest Montgomery was an unemployed truck driver in his early

forties who wanted to make big money. They agreed to form a partnership, with

Montgomery supplying the capital and Atkinson the expertise. Soon after their

meeting Claude Atkinson went to the Indiana statehouse and formed a dummy

corporation, R.P.Z. Investments, using one of his many pseudonyms, Arno Zepp.<p>



<p>



That fall Atkinson supervised the construction of a large "grow room" in the

basement of a secluded cabin that Montgomery owned in Gosport. Montgomery

enlisted his younger brother, Jerry, a gravedigger with a slight drinking

problem, to help with the task. Together the three men drilled holes in the

concrete floor for drainage, built a cooling system, assembled ballasts and

reflectors, suspended grow lights with thousand-watt halide bulbs from the

ceiling, and planted marijuana seeds in small pots. They installed a generator

so that the operation would not be detected through an incongruously high

electric bill. Montgomery invited David Lee Haynes, a young lumberyard ripsaw

operator from Louisville, Kentucky, and the son of an old friend, to come live

at the cabin and tend the plants. After digging graves all day, Jerry

Montgomery would visit the dark basement in the evenings. By spring the group

had approximately 12,500 seedlings of marijuana, contained in sixteen plywood

flats. What they needed next was a farm.<p>



<p>



In May of 1989 Martha Brummett, an elderly woman hard of hearing, agreed to

lease her farmhouse halfway between Eminence and Cloverdale, in Morgan County,

to R.P.Z. Investments. It came with about forty acres, a barn, and an option to

buy. Martha Brummett was surprised that when a "Charlie Peters" arrived to sign

the lease, the woman with him remained in the car and never entered the house.

Nevertheless, Brummett innocently signed over her farm for $10,000 in cash,

which she then took straight to her bank.<p>



<p>



After Ernest Montgomery and his wife, Cindy, obtained the house, David Haynes

moved into it, to babysit the operation, having obtained a sham rental

agreement from R.P.Z. Investments as a legal buffer against what was about to

happen on the land. The group plowed and tilled the field, fertilized it, and

planted corn. Once the corn had reached a good height, they planted marijuana,

hiding it amid the stalks. Over the summer they walked the fields, "sexing" the

marijuana--eliminating all the males. The females, left unpollinated, would

produce a much higher level of delta-9-THC in their buds, and would thus become

a much more valuable crop: sensimilla. In late September, before the corn

leaves turned golden, the group harvested the marijuana and then cured it in

the barn for two weeks and cut it into "books" about a foot wide and three feet

long. The books were hauled into the farmhouse or driven to the cabin in

Gosport for manicuring: the stems, orphan leaves, and fan leaves were separated

from the precious buds. So far the operation had gone smoothly. Soon there

would be about 900 pounds of high-quality marijuana to sell. Now the group

needed buyers. Ernest Montgomery thought that Mark Young, a man whom he had met

a few times with Cindy, might know the right people to call.<p>



<p>



Mark Young was thirty-six and had been smoking marijuana on a daily basis since

his late teens. He grew up in Christian Park Heights, a middle-class

neighborhood on the east side of Indianapolis. His father left the family when

Mark was two; he and his sister, Andrea, were raised by their mother, Mary, who

worked as a waitress or a hostess to pay the bills. Young was a willful,

stubborn, charming boy, always getting into trouble. He seemed to have,

throughout his pranks and petty thefts, the sort of bad luck that is almost

uncanny--often he would get caught while his friends got away. Young dropped

out of high school after a year, became a father at the age of sixteen, married

to give the child his name, divorced, worked as a carpet-layer, washed dishes,

laid concrete, tended bar, sold used cars, and rebuilt Harley-Davidson

motorcycles. He kept an album filled with pictures of his favorite Harleys. He

knew all the local biker gangs, but remained apart; Young seemed to get into

enough trouble on his own. He dated many attractive women, lived a fast life,

and slowly acquired a criminal record--nothing violent, just misdemeanors for

driving without a license, for possession of marijuana, for taking a

girlfriend's stereo. He also earned two felony convictions: one at the age of

twenty-one, for attempting to pass a fraudulent prescription, and the other at

the age of twenty-five, for possession of a few amphetamines and Quaaludes.

Each felony brought a suspended sentence, probation, and a one-dollar fine.

When Ernest Montgomery called, Mark Young was rebuilding motorcycles, selling

used cars wholesale, and looking for new income. He had held a financial

interest in a number of massage parlors, which were now closed. His dream was

to get some money, move to Florida, build custom Harleys, and work part-time as

a fishing guide on Lake Okeechobee.<p>



<p>



Claude Atkinson, Ernest Montgomery, and Mark Young met in the family room of

Young's house in early October. The price of the marijuana was set at $1,200 a

pound. If Young found buyers, he would receive a commission of $100 for every

pound sold. Not long after, Atkinson and Montgomery returned to Young's house,

where they were introduced to two men from Florida who were acting on behalf of

someone seeking to buy all the marijuana the group could supply. Atkinson

offered a hundred pounds a week; the marijuana was still being manicured and

could not be delivered all at once. Within days a man from New York arrived at

Young's house with $120,000 in a cardboard box. While the New York buyer

inspected the marijuana at Montgomery's Indianapolis house, Atkinson remained

behind, counting the money. The deal was completed, and Young was handed

$10,000 in cash. The New York buyer eventually paid for 600 more pounds, in

transactions that took place at Montgomery's house. By Christmas all the

high-quality marijuana was gone, the last 200 pounds either distributed to

workers who had helped with various tasks or sold to an acquaintance of

Montgomery's in Illinois.<p>



<p>



The town of Eminence, Indiana, is about twenty-five miles west of Indianapolis.

Near its only intersection is a Citizens Bank, a small church, a convenience

store, and a post office built of concrete blocks and painted royal blue. The

town boasts 180 inhabitants and looks as though it has not seen much new

construction since the interval between the world wars. There are countless

small towns like Eminence across the Midwest, slightly faded but still

eulogized as the heartland of this country. To reach the farm used by R.P.Z.

Investments, one must leave Eminence on a narrow country road and then turn

onto a dirt road and drive for a long stretch, past fields of fifty to a

hundred acres where corn, hay, soybeans, and wheat are grown, past modest farms

with collapsing outbuildings, an occasional trailer home, and rusted cars on

cinder blocks. Farther west the land is flat, the acreage of each plot

enormous, but here the countryside feels long settled, with hedges and trees

marking boundary lines. After cleaning out the barn, Atkinson and Montgomery

allowed the lease on Martha Brummett's property to expire. The one-story

farmhouse has been painted beige by its latest occupants; the barn remains

bright red. There is a porch on the front of the house, an enclosed patio on

one side, and a swing set on the lawn. Looking at this humble farm, one would

hardly believe that more than a million dollars' worth of marijuana had been

grown there in the space of about three months.<p>

<font size=4><b>Inside The Industry</font></b><p>



<p>



<font size=5>S</font>TEVE White looks like an ordinary Indiana farmer, with slightly unkempt hair,

a graying beard, teeth stained by nicotine, and strong hands. The day we met,

he wore an old flannel shirt, gray pants, and battered work boots. His voice

has a low rural twang. He seems to belong in an old pickup, riding through a

vast dusty field. White is the Indiana coordinator for the Drug Enforcement

Administration's Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program. Of his twenty-six

years in federal law enforcement, twenty-one have been spent in Indiana,

working undercover. He knows the state backwards and forwards--has walked it,

driven it, and flown low over it every summer, scrutinizing hills and farmland.

Nobody ever thinks he is a cop. He gets along well with rural people. He grew

up in New York City and attended P.S. 20; his father worked on Wall Street. He

travels to London each year to indulge a passion for collecting English antique

toy soldiers. Special Agent White would be an implausible character in any work

of fiction. Savvy, articulate, self-deprecating, and blunt, he defies easy

categorization and probably knows more about growing marijuana than most of the

people he arrests.<p>



<p>



Claude Atkinson was an extremely talented grower with a "good product," White

says--and "a super salesman." The operation near Eminence was of average size

for its time. It is difficult, even from the air, to find marijuana hidden in

corn: "Remember North by Northwest?" White says. "Cary Grant in the cornfield?

We don't have cornfields like that anymore, with wide rows. They broadcast the

stuff, and it's just thicker than hell." Sometimes patches of marijuana will be

distributed here and there amid hundreds of acres. Discovering one may not lead

to the others. Growers tend to be much more concerned about hiding their

marijuana from thieves than from the government. A rural underworld has emerged

around marijuana, secretive and unknown to outsiders; booby traps are laid in

cornfields. There is now a group of people in the Marijuana Belt, known as

"patch pirates," who earn a living solely by stealing marijuana from growers,

whom they follow. White acknowledges that the booby traps are usually aimed at

patch pirates, not his own men; nevertheless, fishhooks strung at eye level on

fishing line are nondiscriminatory. Outdoor marijuana farms have become smaller

in the past few years, though last summer White's agents found "60,000

beautiful plants" on a farm in Tippecanoe County. The case proved a

disappointment: the DEA never found the grower. "What I want is bodies," White

explains. "I don't give a damn about the dope--that's just something we're

going to burn up." His job involves a daily cat-and-mouse pursuit of marijuana

growers, with both sides changing tactics, adopting new technologies, and

often, after an arrest, amicably discussing tricks of the trade. White harbors

no animosity toward his prey. "These are not heroin or cocaine dealers," he

says. "They're not violent. I find a lot of them personally engaging." What

they are doing is against the law, however, and White loves tracking them down.

He has had a good deal of success lately. In 1992 Indiana led the nation in

federal arrests for marijuana. Last year it ranked third.<p>



<p>



Take a map of the United States and draw a circle, including within its

circumference Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan, with portions of Ohio to the

east, Kentucky and Tennessee to the south, and Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska to

the west. The region within that circle, Steve White believes, is producing the

majority of the marijuana grown in the United States. The highest-quality

marijuana is cultivated indoors on the West Coast, but for sheer volume, no

other area surpasses the U.S. heartland. White does not find this surprising.

During the Second World War the U.S. government encouraged farmers throughout

the Corn Belt to plant almost 300,000 acres of marijuana, in the hopes of

replacing fiber supplies from Asia which had been cut off by the Japanese. The

program, whose slogan was "Hemp for Victory," turned out to be a financial

disaster and left marijuana growing wild throughout the region. Known as

ditchweed, this marijuana now blankets tens of thousands of acres. For years it

had a negligible delta-9-THC content, and was used mainly as filler by drug

dealers, but there is evidence that the ditchweed may be cross-pollinating with

the potent marijuana now cultivated outdoors. The same growing conditions and

soil that are ideal for corn are also ideal for marijuana. Most local sheriff's

departments employ only three to five officers, with more important things to

do than hunt for marijuana. And over the past fifteen years there have been a

lot of people with strong agricultural skills who have badly needed money--or

have wanted more of it than almost any other job in the region could provide. A

bushel of corn sells for roughly $2.50, a bushel of manicured marijuana for

about $70,000. White thinks that marijuana is the largest cash crop in the

United States, and if not the largest in Indiana, then right up there with corn

and soybeans. Though he is proud of what his office has accomplished, White has

no illusions: "There's more than we think."<p>



<p>



During the 1960s and early 1970s nearly all the marijuana smoked in the United

States was imported, mainly from Mexico, Colombia, and Jamaica. Domestic

production rose in reaction to a number of events. The spraying of an

herbicide, paraquat, over Mexican marijuana fields, begun in 1975, created

uneasiness about that nation's product. Successful interdiction efforts by the

U.S. Border Patrol and the Coast Guard made smuggling marijuana more difficult.

And the tougher legal sanctions against trafficking led some foreign drug

dealers to switch from marijuana, a bulk agricultural good with a strong smell,

to cocaine, which is easier to conceal and brings a far higher return per

pound. As marijuana prices rose, American growers responded to consumer demand.

Mark A.R. Kleiman, an associate professor at Harvard University's Kennedy

School of Government, finds this to be a rare instance in which protectionism

actually worked. The anti-drug movement and the burgeoning American marijuana

crop led the DEA to devote more of its resources to marijuana investigations.

Kleiman estimates that by 1988 federal anti-marijuana efforts totaled

approximately $970 million--about 20 to 25 percent of all federal

drug-enforcement expenditures. By 1992 federal convictions for marijuana

outnumbered those for heroin, crack cocaine, and LSD combined. The DEA's

Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program began in 1979 in two states,

California and Hawaii; it now looks for marijuana-farming operations--called

"grows" or "gardens" by members of the trade--in all fifty states.<p>



<p>



No one knows exactly how much marijuana is cultivated in the United States. The

numbers published by the government--or anyone else--are largely speculative.

In 1992 the DEA eradicated 3,405 metric tons of cultivated marijuana in the

United States, an amount the DEA says represents more than half the total

domestic output. Critics believe that the DEA actually finds only 10 to 20

percent of the marijuana being grown in this country. With prices ranging from

$500 a pound, for low-quality New Mexican marijuana, to more than $5,000 a

pound for "boutique" strains like Northern Lights and Afghan Kush, it can be

confidently stated that the black market for American marijuana, whatever the

actual tonnage, is immense.<p>



<p>



Growers are increasingly moving their crops indoors, using artificial light and

hydroponics, to avoid theft, reduce the risk of detection, control the growing

process, and profit from up to six harvests a year. Thirty mature plants can

easily be grown in an area the size of a bathtub. I asked Steve White to list

some of the places where he has discovered indoor grow operations. He laughed.

"It would be tough for me to say places we haven't found them." Often a false

wall hides a grow room in a house, or a house's foundation doesn't match its

basement, which seems oddly smaller, or there are second stories with no

stairwells, or crawl spaces are hidden beneath floors. Once White rummaged

through a child's closet and found the entrance to a grow area behind the toys.

Without need of a search warrant, the DEA employs thermal-imaging devices,

mounted on helicopters and low-flying airplanes, to detect abnormal heat

sources that may indicate the presence of an indoor growing operation--or a

pottery kiln, or a Jacuzzi. What is found depends upon the skill of the

technician. White has learned that one of the best ways to find an indoor grow

area is with his nose: no matter how well-vented the operation, and despite

electronic devices that can neutralize odors in the air, marijuana will exude a

powerful scent. A few years ago indoor grows were often huge. A group of

janitors in Anderson, Indiana, who had traveled to Israel to study hydroponics,

were caught with 8,100 plants in a building with walls constructed a foot thick

to thwart infrared detection. Nowadays growers rent storage units and

apartments, using phony names and paying in cash, and build small grow

operations at different locations, with timing devices and automatic controls.

The authorities may find one or two--a loss anticipated in the grower's

business plan--without being able to trace ownership.<p>



<p>



White has smoked marijuana once, while working undercover, and did not enjoy

the experience. He chain-smokes cigarettes, regrets it, and sees no need to add

marijuana to the nation's list of legal drugs. "We've got tobacco, we've got

alcohol," he said. "Jesus Christ, do we need another hallucinogenic,

carcinogenic substance on the market?" What disturbs him most about marijuana

is the phenomenal sums of money it funnels into an underground economy, and the

great resulting potential for corruption among public officials. I asked

whether a sense of futility ever creeps into his work, given the extent of

cultivation in his state. "I'm not such a fool as to sit here and tell you that

we're going to wipe out marijuana," he replied. But there is no doubt in his

mind that the DEA exerts a deterrent effect. "Every time we have a helicopter

go up on a mission," White said, "there's someone down below who sees it and

thinks, 'Maybe I better not.'"<p>



<p>



Ralph Weisheit, a professor of criminal justice at Illinois State University,

does not know Steve White but has come to many of the same conclusions about

marijuana cultivation in the Midwest. Weisheit first became interested in the

subject eight years ago, when he saw, on the television news, an old Illinois

farmer being arrested for cultivating marijuana. The farmer and his son never

smoked marijuana; they grew it to save their farm from foreclosure. Weisheit

was intrigued. With a grant from the research arm of the U.S. Justice

Department, he conducted a two-year study of marijuana cultivation,

interviewing law-enforcement officials in five states and dozens of Illinois

growers who had been caught and convicted. The book based on that study,

Domestic Marijuana: A Neglected Industry (1992), chronicles the rise of

marijuana production in the United States and offers a fascinating portrait of

the growers. Weisheit agrees that the majority of marijuana grown in America

probably originates in the nine-state region described by Steve White. He also

thinks that marijuana is the nation's largest cash crop, by a very wide

margin.<p>



<p>



Estimates of how many Americans grow marijuana range from one to three million,

of which anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 are commercial growers. Weisheit

found that aside from being predominantly white and male, marijuana growers

generally do not fit any common stereotypes. Some are pragmatists, growing the

drug purely for the money; during the farm crisis of the 1980s many farmers in

the Marijuana Belt started cultivating marijuana out of desperation. They found

it not only easy money but also easy work. As one farmer told Weisheit, "You

know, I spent most of my life trying to kill weeds, so trying to keep one alive

was hardly a challenge." Other growers are hustlers by nature, classic American

entrepreneurs; they might as well be selling time-shares in a vacation

condominium. They try to build marijuana empires. The risks of the trade only

add to its appeal. Other growers are less competitive, giving away marijuana to

friends or selling it at slightly above cost, sharing agricultural techniques,

comparing their crops the way neighbors might compare homegrown tomatoes.

Marijuana growers are educated and uneducated, liberal and conservative. They

are extremely secretive, worrying more about thieves than about the police. Few

belong to NORML (the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws)

and few read High Times magazine or add their names to any list that might

arouse suspicion. Indoor growing often attracts people who love gizmos. There

are endless contraptions that can be added to a grow room, from

computer-controlled watering systems to electric tables that distribute

nutrients evenly by tilting back and forth. Some growers become connoisseurs,

producing high-quality marijuana in small quantities, manipulating not only the

level of delta-9-THC through cross-breeding but also the proportions of all the

other cannabinoids to subtly--or not so subtly--affect the nature of the high.

Weisheit met growers and law-enforcement officers alike who were

extraordinarily passionate about marijuana, eager to discuss its arcane details

for hours. He was surprised, after the publication of his book, by how little

controversy it generated in either camp. His mother was disturbed, however, by

one of its central implications: "She's very anti-drug," Weisheit says, "and

her comment was, 'The thing I don't like about this book is that it makes these

people seem so normal.'"<p>



<p>



Late one night I met a commercial marijuana grower who introduced himself as

"Dave." He has been growing marijuana on and off for more than a decade,

beginning outdoors and graduating to a series of increasingly complex indoor

grow systems. Understandably paranoid and suspicious, Dave is also quite proud

of his work and regrets being unable to discuss it with friends. His grow

operation had to be built surreptitiously, over a period of weeks, like a

factory assembled by hand. It utilizes about $50,000 worth of high-tech

hydroponic equipment. When the construction was complete, the whole thing

looked so beautiful that Dave wanted to throw an opening-night party, but he

decided that would not be a good idea. Though he always hated gardening and

never passed a science class in his life, he now has a grasp of marijuana

botany, plant biology, and advanced greenhouse-management techniques which only

Special Agent White could fully appreciate. As he smoked some of his most

recent harvest, Dave shared with me some of the pleasures, risks, rewards, and

bizarre phenomena associated with his profession.<p>



<p>



Hidden behind a fake wall, entered through a secret door, in a neighborhood

where you would never, ever, expect to find it, Dave's operation is much larger

than most. There are hundreds of marijuana plants in long rows, growing from

cubes of rock wool, a soil-less medium spun from synthetic fibers, connected

through an intricate system of white plastic pipes. Suspended above them are

extremely bright high-pressure sodium lights, which require a surge of power

from special ballasts to start up. On the ceiling is the bluish flame of a

carbon-dioxide generator burning natural gas. The windows have been sealed and

blacked out. The room is quite warm, the air thick and humid, the whole place

filled with a pungent smell reminiscent of fresh hay. Like a greenhouse without

glass, it feels very still and quiet, except for the sound of water rushing

through narrow pipes.<p>



<p>



When everything is running smoothly, Dave controls the elements necessary for

his plants: air, light, heat, and water. In a closed chamber there is no wind;

here a ventilation system provides it, circulating air rich in carbon dioxide.

When outdoor temperatures drop too low, Dave uses the CO2 generator on the

ceiling--in effect "fertilizing the air." Pumps and timers automatically water

the plants, also delivering nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and

potassium, which would normally be derived from soil. One of the critical

factors in growing marijuana is the proportion of darkness to light. Sometimes

Dave's high-pressure sodium lights burn eighteen hours a day, raising the

temperature in the grow room to as high as 110 degrees. During the female

plant's reproductive stage there must be long periods of total, uninterrupted

darkness. As little as two footcandles of light can disrupt the delicate

process by which delta-9-THC accumulates in the buds. Turning on a flashlight

at the wrong moment, Dave says, is enough to ruin his plants.<p>



<p>



He is truly a connoisseur, growing an expensive strain of marijuana from the

northern Hindu Kush. As he describes how some outdoor growers stuff marijuana

into plastic garbage bags while it is still wet, he grimaces, like a master

vintner appalled by the improper handling of grapes. The buds are very fragile,

he says: "You're trying to coax this mature flower to retain its essence--and

then store it and seal it at that instant in time." His finished product is

deep green and aromatic, like some rare, exotic spice.<p>



<p>



Growing marijuana indoors requires much more work than cultivating it outdoors.

There is also more potential for disaster. A splash of liquid on a hot light

will cause it to explode. A broken pipe can flood the room with hundreds of

gallons of water. A power outage shuts the whole system down. The nutrient

solution, if improperly monitored, can quickly turn too acidic and, as Dave

puts it, "give the plants a heart attack." More common, and yet somehow more

surreal, are insect infestations that can harm valuable young plants. Dave has

battled spider mites, greenhouse whiteflies, and aphids. Insecticides are not

an option in an enclosed room, with a crop that will be smoked. Dave uses

biological controls, unleashing hungry young predators upon unwanted bugs.

Recently he released thousands of miniature wasps. This is insanity, he

thought; but it worked. Inside a nearby refrigerator he always keeps 500

ladybug eggs, next to the soda, in case of an emergency. At the moment Dave is

contending with gnats, who leave his plants alone but swarm and bite him as he

walks about the grow room in the dark.<p>



<BR>



<font size=4><b>Someone At The Door</font></b><p>



<p>



<font size=5>O</font>N March 18, 1990, a pair of deputy sheriffs in Johnson County, Indiana,

spotted a red Jeep being driven erratically and signaled for its driver to pull

off the road. Behind the wheel they found Jerry Montgomery, obviously

intoxicated; littering the truck were three empty vodka bottles, a five-gallon

bucket full of marijuana, and a gray box containing more than $13,000 in cash.

After obtaining a warrant, sheriffs searched Montgomery's house, finding more

marijuana and a locked briefcase hidden under his bed. Deputy John Myers pried

it open with a screwdriver. In the briefcase were receipts for farm equipment;

documents mentioning R.P.Z. Investments, Claude Atkinson, and Ernest

Montgomery; an option to buy a property owned by Martha Brummett; and a number

of books suggesting that this arrest was the beginning, not the end, of a

trail: Indoor Marijuana Horticulture, The Primo Plant, and How to Grow

Marijuana Indoors Under Lights.<p>



<p>



The investigation eventually led authorities to a 500-acre farm close to

Solsberry, in Greene County, owned by Arno Zepp, of Investment Holdings, Inc.

On August 22 federal, state, and local law-enforcement agents arrested Claude

Atkinson, raided the farm, and, with the help of volunteers from the Indiana

National Guard, destroyed 10,000 marijuana plants. Atkinson soon began to talk.

In May of 1991 Ernest Montgomery was arrested at his Gosport cabin, where 7,000

marijuana seedlings sat in little pots, ready for planting. Early that same

morning Mark Young was awakened by someone at the front door. Unlike his former

business associates, Young was not growing anything. He and his girlfriend,

Patricia, were in the process of moving to Florida. When he saw a man with a

badge and a gun, Young had no idea what was happening, but assumed that it must

have something to do with unpaid taxes.<p>



<p>



More than a dozen law-enforcement officers surrounded the house. Their

commander, a DEA agent, treated Young politely, allowing him to get dressed and

agreeing not to handcuff him in front of the neighbors. At the station Young

read his indictment. He was being charged, under federal law, not only for his

role in distributing 700 pounds of marijuana but also for conspiring to

manufacture all 12,500 marijuana plants grown on Martha Brummett's farm. Young

was unaware of the punishment he might face until later that day. John

Hollywood, a bail bondsman in Indianapolis, arrived in the afternoon to secure

his release. But the government refused to set bail. Under Indiana's strict

state law, the same charges would bring a maximum sentence of twenty-eight

years--at most, fourteen years served in prison, and probably much less. But

under federal law Young's two prior state felony convictions, one of them more

than seventeen years old, classified him as a career drug offender. This arrest

could prove his third strike. At the U.S. attorney's discretion, he faced a

possible mandatory-minimum sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of

parole.<p>

	<i><font size=4>The vigorous enforcement of marijuana laws has resulted in four million arrests

	<font size=5>D</font>uring the 1980s criminal penalties for marijuana offenses were made much

tougher, at both the state and federal levels. More resources were devoted to

their enforcement. And punishments more severe than those administered during

the "reefer madness" of the 1930s became routine. As a result there may be more

people in prison today for violating marijuana laws than at any other time in

the nation's history.<p>



<p>



Mark Young is one of those prisoners. In May of 1991 Young was arrested at his

Indianapolis home for brokering the sale of 700 pounds of marijuana grown on a

farm in nearby Morgan County. He had never before been charged with drug

trafficking. He had no history of violent crime. His two prior felony

convictions--one for attempting to fill a false prescription, the other for

possession of a few Quaaludes and amphetamines--were more than a decade old.

For each of these convictions he had received a suspended sentence and a

one-dollar fine. Young's role in the marijuana transaction had been that of a

middleman. He never handled either the marijuana or the money. He had simply

introduced two partners in a marijuana farm, Claude Atkinson and Ernest

Montgomery, to a couple of men from Florida who were acting on behalf of a New

York buyer. Under federal law Young was charged with "conspiracy to

manufacture" marijuana and was held liable for the cultivation of all 12,500

marijuana plants grown on the Morgan County farm. The U.S. attorney now had the

option of filing for an "enhancement," owing to Young's prior drug felonies;

this would trigger a mandatory-minimum sentence upon conviction. After being

denied bail, Mark Young learned that his marijuana offense could lead to a

mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the chance of parole. His case

helps shed light not only on a quiet revolution in the realm of marijuana laws

but also on the often perverse consequences of mandatory-minimum sentences.<p>



<BR>



<font size=4><b>The New Rules</font></b><p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HERE have been mandatory-minimum sentences in the United States since the days

of the first Congress, most of them adopted to punish narrowly defined crimes.

A number of the old mandatory minimums are still on the books, for offenses

such as "robbery by pirates" (1790) and "practice of pharmacy and sale of

poisons in China" (1915). The overwhelming majority of criminal laws passed by

Congress specify only a maximum sentence. It has historically been the role of

a federal judge to determine whether a convicted offender deserves that

maximum, a lesser sentence, or no prison sentence at all. Until seven years ago

a federal judge had great leeway in choosing sentences: Congress set only the

upper limits, thereby protecting citizens from excessive punishment. Parole

boards served as another brake on unduly harsh sentences, deciding when

prisoners merited early release.<p>



<p>



The first broadly defined mandatory minimums were contained in the Boggs Act,

which was passed at the height of the McCarthy era, amid the tensions of the

Korean War and domestic fears of Communist subversion. There seemed to be an

increase in narcotics use among the young, and lenient judges were thought to

be partly to blame. Members of Congress vied to appear tough on drug offenders.

Senator Everett Dirksen favored legislation that allowed the death penalty for

selling narcotics to minors. Congressman Edwin Arthur Hall advocated giving

drug dealers mandatory-minimum sentences of a hundred years. Congressman L.

Gary Clemente introduced a bill recommending the death penalty for any

violation of the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act. The commissioner of the

Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Harry J. Anslinger, seemed almost moderate in

calling for a mandatory minimum of five years for second offenders, which he

assured Congress "would just about dry up the [drug] traffic." Congress

followed his advice and then lengthened the anti-drug mandatory sentences, in

1956. One vocal critic of the new sentencing regime was James V. Bennett, the

director of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, who attributed the passage of such laws

to "hysteria." Thereafter Bennett was followed by FBN agents, who submitted

reports on his movements and speeches.<p>



<p>



By the late 1960s a widespread consensus had emerged in both political parties

that the anti-drug mandatory-minimum sentences were a failure. Members of

Congress, federal judges, and even prosecutors found them too severe, unjust,

and, worst of all, ineffective at preventing narcotics use. The spread of the

1960s drug culture had hardly been impeded by the existence of

mandatory-minimum sentences. In 1970 Congress repealed almost all the mandatory

penalties for drug offenders, an act celebrated by, among others, Congressman

George Bush, who predicted that these "penal reforms" would "result in better

justice and more appropriate sentences." A movement arose seeking a new means

of determining federal sentences. Allowing too little judicial discretion had

proved to be unfair, but too much could also lead to inequities: a bank robber

in Florida might be given twenty years by a federal judge, whereas a bank

robber in California received probation for exactly the same crime. Marvin

Frankel, a federal district judge in New York, imagined a system in which a

commission of legal experts would set guidelines on how to determine sentences

for various crimes, taking into account details of the offender's criminal

history and the nature of the offense.<p>



<p>



After long and careful deliberation, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 was

passed by Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support, creating the United

States Sentencing Commission. It seemed a triumph of rational jurisprudence

over demagoguery, an experiment in social planning that evoked shades of the

Progressive Era, when panels of appointed experts were hailed as the ideal form

of government. Judge William W. Wilkins Jr., a former protege of Senator Strom

Thurmond and Ronald Reagan's first appointee to the federal bench, was made

chairman of the new commission. In only eighteen months Wilkins and his fellow

commissioners devised sentences of varying severity for about 2,000 different

federal crimes. These sentencing guidelines took effect in 1987. Under the new

rules each federal offense was assigned a numerical value; the judge added or

subtracted points in a given case, according to various criteria; and

punishment was determined by matching an offender's total points with a range

of applicable sentences listed on a chart. A judge could depart from the

guidelines at sentencing, but had to offer an explanation for doing so. The

sentence could later be appealed by the defendant--or the prosecutor.<p>



<p>



The same Congress that passed the Sentencing Reform Act also included in that

very bill mandatory-minimum sentences for drug offenses committed near schools.

Two years later the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 moved away from the deliberate

calibrations of the sentencing guidelines by endorsing the blunt instrument of

mandatory-minimum sentences for a wide variety of drug offenses. The University

of Maryland basketball star Len Bias had just been killed by crack cocaine, and

anti-drug sentiment had reached new heights; lawmakers decided once again to

send a tough message. Mandatory-minimum sentences, based on the amount of drugs

involved in an offense, were set at five years, ten years, and twenty years.

Additional mandatory minimums were added later, including what is now known as

a "three strikes, you're out" provision that specified life sentences for

repeat drug offenders. During the congressional debates on these mandatory

sentences there was little mention of the precedent of failure set by the Boggs

Act, or of how the new laws would undermine the sentencing guidelines, or of

what the wider effects might be on various aspects of the criminal-justice

system, from the initial filing of charges to the ultimate rates of

imprisonment. According to one survey, the most commonly cited justification

for the harsh new punishments was a desire for retribution, a legal theory

nicknamed "just desserts."<p>



<p>



For most of the nation's first 200 years a convicted man or woman could ask a

federal judge for mercy. On the basis of extenuating circumstances, a judge

could reduce a prison sentence or waive it altogether. The new

mandatory-minimum laws took that power away from the judge and handed it to the

prosecutor. A U.S. attorney now has the sole authority to decide whether a

mandatory minimum applies in a particular case--that is, whether to frame a

charge under such a statute or not. The only way a defendant can be sure of

avoiding a mandatory-minimum sentence is to plead guilty and give "substantial

assistance" in the prosecution of someone else. The U.S. attorney, not the

judge, decides whether the defendant's cooperation is sufficient to warrant a

reduction in sentence. A defendant might cooperate and still not receive a

shorter sentence, if the information supplied falls short of expectations. Long

mandatory prison terms provide a strong incentive to talk. From the

government's point of view, guilty pleas, accompanied by cooperation, avoid

expensive trials and supply valuable evidence. From the defendant's point of

view, the pressure to name others is enormous.<p>



<p>



Some federal judges believe that the quality of much testimony in court has

diminished; desperate people will say anything to save themselves. An appeal

for compassion is now pointless; all that matters is the demand for

cooperation. Under such a system the dilemmas often have an elemental quality.

This past January in Kansas City, Tora S. Brown--a nineteen-year-old first

offender with an eight-month-old daughter--cooperated with the government in a

drug case involving PCP but refused to implicate her own mother. Brown was

given a ten-year prison sentence without the chance of parole.<p>



<BR>



<font size=4><b>"A Sad Day For Everybody"</font></b><p>



<p>



<font size=5>A</font>SSISTANT U.S. Attorney Donna Eide, in the Southern District of Indiana,

offered Mark Young a reduced sentence in return for a guilty plea and his

cooperation: forty years without the chance of parole. Kevin McShane, Young's

attorney, thought the offer ridiculous; he wouldn't accept forty years as a

plea bargain in a first-degree-murder case. That remained the government's only

offer from May to September of 1991. Meanwhile, one by one, the other

defendants in the conspiracy case "flipped," agreeing to cooperate.<p>



<p>



Claude Atkinson had been facing a mandatory life sentence, the others sentences

of ten years to life. By offering cooperation each had received a "cap" on his

sentence, an upper limit, of anywhere from eight to thirty-five years. But each

could also conceivably walk free, without any prison time. Their sentences

would depend on their performances in court, among other things. Young and

Ernest Montgomery and his wife, Cindy, were the only remaining defendants who

would not plead guilty.<p>



<p>



Under the U.S. sentencing guidelines, Mark Young's marijuana offense warranted

a prison term of roughly twenty-two to twenty-seven years. The guidelines would

apply in his case unless the U.S. attorney decided to file an enhancement,

reflecting Young's criminal history and requiring the mandatory life sentence.

Donna Eide made one last offer: eighteen years, pending cooperation. Young

refused it. The government filed its enhancement on the Friday before the trial

was to begin. The wheels had been set in motion, and Mark Young had a long

weekend in which to make his choice: agree to cooperate or risk spending the

rest of his life in prison.<p>



<p>



Kevin McShane does not believe that the government really wanted to give his

client a life sentence; that sort of threat is now common in the give-and-take

of the plea-bargaining process. He does not believe that the government really

wanted any information from Mark Young. Claude Atkinson, who knew more than

anyone else about the marijuana farm, was talking up a storm. The identities of

the New York and Florida buyers would have been of interest to federal

authorities in other districts, but it was not clear that Young even knew their

real names. On the eve of the trial it seemed that the government simply wanted

to avoid a trial. McShane strongly advised Young to accept the offer of

eighteen years; with so many potentially hostile witnesses, his chances in

court were uncertain--a roll of the dice. Young's family, which to this point

had remained silent on the issue, also urged him to cooperate. His mother

visited him in jail and begged. "At the end, when we saw how bad it was, I just

really got on him," she recalls. "'Please, Mark, do it, do like the rest of

them are, don't do this, don't end up, you know, with a life sentence, don't do

it. Tell whatever you have to tell, like the rest of them are doing, to save

yourself.' But no way would he do it. No way."<p>



<p>



The day before Mark Young's trial began, Cindy Montgomery agreed to a plea

bargain. The trial was notable for the details it revealed about the

marijuana-growing operation, but the outcome never seemed in doubt. McShane

thinks that Young's case was hurt by being tried alongside that of Ernest

Montgomery, who had organized the operation. Jerry Montgomery testified against

his brother and proved unable, owing to illiteracy, to read his own plea

agreement for the jury. Cindy Montgomery testified against her husband. And

Claude Atkinson spoke at length about everybody's criminal activities. The

atmosphere at the trial was enlivened by jailhouse rumors that Mark Young not

only had threatened the lives of Cindy Montgomery and Claude Atkinson and their

families but also had slept with one of the jurors, who was going to thwart any

guilty verdict. Young called no witnesses in his own defense. There was no

physical evidence linking him to the crime, only testimony by Atkinson and

Cindy Montgomery. The jury took just two and a quarter hours to render guilty

verdicts on all counts. It had not been informed that a life sentence might

apply.<p>



<p>



Claude Atkinson was angry to receive a twenty-five-year sentence despite his

cooperation. One of the prosecutors later described Atkinson as a "dreamer"; he

may have expected to serve only a few years. For a sixty-two-year-old man, a

twenty-five-year sentence was tantamount to life in prison. Ernest Montgomery,

whose only previous conviction was for disorderly conduct, got thirty-four

years without the chance of parole--also, in effect, a life sentence. His

brother received eight years, his wife six, and the other defendants sentences

ranging from three to ten years in prison. On February 8, 1992, Judge Sarah

Evans Barker gave Mark Young a life sentence, as mandated. She also fined him

$100, but did not order any of his assets forfeited; he had none, having paid

his lawyer with a used car. "Mr. Young, it's a sad day for everybody in the

courtroom," she said. "That concludes the matter."<p>



<p>



A few years ago a federal judge in Utah, Thomas Green, refused to give two

young drug offenders mandatory-minimum sentences of ten years each, ruling that

their due-process rights had been violated by the decision to prosecute them

under federal law. The same charges under state law probably would have brought

prison terms of about two years. Congress, Judge Green observed, had severely

curtailed the discretion of federal judges at sentencing, but had placed no

similar restrictions on the behavior of law-enforcement officers and U.S.

attorneys. As a result, the nation now faced "de facto sentencing by police and

prosecutors." During the Bush Administration, Attorney General Richard

Thornburgh did try to limit the freedom of federal prosecutors. He told them to

seek the maximum penalty in every drug case, regardless of mitigating

circumstances. The so-called Thornburgh Memorandum, still included in the

handbooks issued to all U.S. attorneys, instructs them always to pursue

conviction on the most serious "readily provable" charge. U.S. attorneys,

however, are not obliged to follow that advice. In some parts of the country

they have faithfully adhered to the Thornburgh Memorandum. In other parts

individual exceptions have been allowed when a sentence seemed particularly

cruel. In a few districts U.S. attorneys who oppose mandatory minimums have

been collaborating with sympathetic judges, finding ways to help low-level drug

offenders avoid long prison terms.<p>



<p>



The Supreme Court has upheld federal mandatory minimums whenever they have been

challenged on constitutional grounds, consolidating the increase in

prosecutorial power. A U.S. attorney wields enormous influence in drug cases by

deciding how to frame a charge, what quantity of the drug to include in the

charge--and even whether to press federal charges at all. A different

prosecutor might have charged Mark Young only with drug trafficking, likely

bringing him a sentence of about seven years. Young's conviction for

"conspiracy to manufacture" all 12,500 plants shows how broadly that crime is

now being interpreted. The owners of garden-supply stores have been held

legally responsible for marijuana grown by their customers--an application of

conspiracy theory similar to that which once imprisoned people for selling

sugar to moonshiners. Often the most important factor in determining a sentence

is the amount of marijuana involved. Mandatory minimums ignore the defendant's

role in the crime: a "mule" driving a truckload of marijuana can be subject to

the same penalty as the person financing the shipment. In fact, defendants with

the smallest role in conspiracies often serve the longest sentences, because

they have so little information to trade. According to Judge Wilkins, of the

U.S. Sentencing Commission, prosecutors do not pursue mandatory minimums in

about two thirds of the applicable cases. Their reasoning is not made public.

Unlike sentences administered by judges, those derived through plea bargains

are settled behind closed doors.<p>



<p>



Drug offenses differ from most crimes in being subject to three jurisdictions:

local, state, and federal. A U.S. attorney, simply by deciding to enter a

particular case, may greatly skew the range of potential punishments. A person

may even be tried twice for the same drug crime: found innocent by a state

jury, marijuana growers can be--and have been--subsequently convicted in

federal court. There are no established criteria for when a U.S. attorney will

enter a marijuana case. The federal government could prosecute any and every

marijuana offender in America if it so desired, but in a typical year it

charges less than two percent of those arrested. In some districts there is a

policy that the U.S. attorney will enter cases involving more than a hundred

plants or a hundred pounds. In others a federal prosecutor may simply take a

special interest in a case. Two years ago Edward Czuprynski, a liberal activist

who had long irritated public officials in Bay City, Michigan, was convicted in

federal court of possession of 1.6 grams of marijuana: the amount found in a

large joint. Under Michigan law he most likely would have received a $100 fine.

But in federal court Czuprynski was sentenced to fourteen months in prison. His

license to practice law was suspended. His successful law firm closed down.

"They busted me completely," he says, "and that's what they wanted to do."

After spending almost eight months in prison, Czuprynski was released by order

of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, a decision that the U.S. attorney is now

seeking to overturn. Considering his legal fees of $40,000, his lost income of

ten times that amount, and the untold thousands of dollars the federal

government has already spent on his case, Czuprynski says, "That may be the

most expensive joint in the nation's history."<p>



<p>



Four years ago Julie Stewart founded Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a

grassroots organization with the motto "Let the Punishment Fit the Crime." She

had not given much thought to America's drug laws until her older brother was

convicted for having grown 375 marijuana seedlings. His sentence was five

years. FAMM now has more than 20,000 members, most of them politically active

for the first time in their lives. After Mark Young was arrested, his older

sister, Andrea Strong, lost three housecleaning jobs in suburban

Indianapolis--a sign of the great stigma that marijuana still carries in many

parts of the country. Strong is now FAMM's Midwest coordinator, a self-taught

expert on federal criminal law and a tireless campaigner for the repeal of

mandatory minimums. FAMM lobbies Congress for sentencing reform and compiles

case histories of inmates imprisoned under mandatory-minimum laws. Among them

are Michael T. Irish, a first offender sentenced to twelve years in federal

prison for helping to unload hashish from a boat; Charles Dunlap, a first

offender sentenced to eight years in federal prison for renting a truck used by

a friend to import marijuana; and Zodenta McCarter, a sixty-six-year-old woman,

a first offender, poor and illiterate, suffering from diabetes, described as

"naive, trusting, and childlike in comprehension," sentenced to eight years in

federal prison for conspiring to sell ditchweed (a strain of wild marijuana

that is rarely psychoactive). Since being incarcerated McCarter has had a heart

attack, been infected with tuberculosis, and endured three operations.<p>

<font size=5>L</font>EAVENWORTH Penitentiary is the oldest prison in the federal system. It may

also be the most dangerous. One hundred years ago there were no federal

prisons. The roughly 2,500 convicts with federal sentences longer than a year

served their time in state facilities scattered across the country. In 1896

Congress appropriated funds for construction of the first federal penitentiary,

to be located on more than 1,500 acres in rural Kansas, a few miles from the

Army base at Fort Leavenworth. The new prison was built by the convicts who

would soon occupy it. In the eighty-eight years since it opened, only one

prisoner has ever escaped from Leavenworth and eluded recapture. The red-brick

walls, with a gun tower at each corner, are thirty-five feet high and extend an

equal distance beneath the ground. The main building is massive, ominous, and

redolent of power. It was designed to resemble the U.S. Capitol, converting a

symbol of freedom into one of punishment and obedience. On a bleak winter

morning, when the grayness of the sky and that of the neighboring fields seem

to merge, Leavenworth looks exactly as an inmate described it more than six

decades ago: like a "giant mausoleum adrift in a great sea of nothingness."<p>



<p>



To reach the visiting room, you must state your name and purpose to a

corrections officer in a small gun tower and then climb stairs to the front

entrance. After passing through two electric doors reinforced with steel bars

you are photographed; stamped with invisible ink; asked to sign a pledge that

you are not bearing firearms, explosives, or narcotics; led through a metal

detector; and then escorted through another large door with steel bars. The

visiting room looks like a Knights of Columbus meeting hall, with blond-wood

paneling, a row of vending machines, and comfortable chairs separated by small

tables. There is no glass between inmates and their guests. Visits are

supervised by corrections officers who sit on a platform at one end of the

room; surveillance cameras are hidden in the ceiling. As I waited to meet Mark

Young, a small boy ran up and down the length of the room playing with his

father, a bearded inmate in khaki work clothes.<p>



<p>



Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School,

regards Leavenworth as a perfect microcosm of the federal prison system today:

antiquated, often overcrowded, and extremely dangerous both for inmates and for

corrections officers. Leavenworth's rated capacity is about 1,100 prisoners,

but at times in the past year it has housed more than 1,600. Overcrowding

vastly increases the risk of violence; prison riots become virtually

inevitable. The federal system as a whole is operating at about 40 percent

above capacity. Some facilities now house two to three times the number of

people they were designed to hold, even as the federal prison population

increases at a rate of about 10,000 inmates a year.<p>



<p>



Tough federal drug laws, strictly enforced, have fueled this unprecedented

growth in the federal prison system. The Boggs Act of the 1950s did not have

the same effect, because drug offenses were less common and less vigorously

prosecuted. As late as 1967 the Federal Bureau of Narcotics had only 300

agents. Its successor, the Drug Enforcement Administration, now has 3,400.

During the 1980s annual federal spending to incarcerate drug offenders rose

more than 1,300 percent, from $88 million to $1.3 billion. Anti-drug

mandatory-minimum sentences and the guideline sentences formulated to mesh

neatly with them have transformed the inmate population. In 1970, 16.3 percent

of all federal prisoners were drug offenders; today the proportion of federal

prisoners who are drug offenders has reached 62 percent. Within three years it

should reach 72 percent. Many are first offenders, without so much as a

previous arrest, who have been imprisoned for low-level drug violations. Of the

4,244 people convicted last year of violating federal marijuana laws, 56

percent had no criminal record deemed relevant at sentencing. State

correctional facilities are also being overwhelmed by drug offenders. The

prison systems in forty states are now operating under court order to reduce

overcrowding. Violent criminals are sometimes being released early to provide

cell space for nonviolent drug offenders whose mandatory sentences do not

permit parole. The number of drug offenders imprisoned in America today--about

200,000--is the same as the number of people imprisoned for all crimes in 1970.

Since the latest war on drugs began, in 1982, the nation's prison population

has more than doubled. The United States now has the highest rate of

incarceration in the world. No society in history has ever imprisoned so many

of its own citizens for purposes of crime control.<p>



<p>



Mark Young is big--about six foot five, with the build one would expect of an

old biker. He has long hair tied in a ponytail. He seems like a hippie version

of the country-and-western star Hank Williams Jr., with a gravelly drawl and a

deadpan sense of humor. Before being sent to Leavenworth, Young married his

longtime girlfriend, Patricia Rowland, in a Native American ceremony at the

local jail. Patricia visits him as often as she can, but it is a nine- or

ten-hour drive from Indianapolis to Leavenworth, Kansas. She brings him

photographs of changes in their neighborhood: new houses, new stores opening at

the mall. They discuss how furniture should be rearranged at their rented home;

she later moves things around accordingly, and sends him pictures. She does not

want him to forget that a familiar world still exists outside the brutal one he

now inhabits.<p>



<p>



Young had never been in prison before being sentenced to Leavenworth. A

marijuana offense usually leads to incarceration at a minimum-security prison

or prison camp. But Young's life sentence labels him as a high risk for

attempted escape, requiring that he serve his sentence at a maximum-security

penitentiary. Young now finds himself living among some of the most violent

repeat offenders in the federal system: murderers, rapists, armed robbers,

international terrorists. His two-man cell is eight feet by ten feet, with a

solid-metal sliding door and no view of the outdoors, just a window facing the

catwalk. A few months after his arrival Young sat in a prison auditorium,

packed with inmates, watching Silence of the Lambs. A riot suddenly erupted in

the darkness. Prisoners divided by race and tore furniture apart to make

weapons. Corrections officers were taken hostage. Amid the chaos Young grabbed

a piece of a chair and huddled against the theater wall, terrified. When

officers finally quelled the riot, hours later, Young was teargassed,

handcuffed, and dragged along the floor through a pool of blood. Because of

Young's size, other inmates have so far left him alone. "But anything can

happen here to anyone, at any time," he told me, snapping his fingers. "Just

like that." Inmates with life sentences and no chance of parole have nothing to

lose. Last year a good friend of Young's, Clyde Harrison, was stabbed to death

in the dining room, before hundreds of other people, over a $50 debt. The

killer politely handed the knife to a corrections officer, handle first. Young

had never witnessed anything like it. His friend died instantly, and then

"people were stepping over him to get to the salad bar."<p>



<p>



Young's trial was such a strange experience that he finds it difficult to

describe. One would have to be very stoned, he thinks, to appreciate how absurd

it felt. He hardly knew Ernest Montgomery and had met Claude Atkinson only

twice, spending a total of less than an hour with him. He had never visited the

farm where the marijuana was grown, and to this day does not know its location.

Most of the people who testified in court were people whom Young had never laid

eyes on before. It makes no sense to him that the law should give him a life

sentence for conspiring to cultivate marijuana. Young is quite candid about a

lot of socially unacceptable things he has done, and he admits to finding a

buyer for the Indiana group, but he ridicules Atkinson's efforts during the

trial to depict him as a major broker, a Paine Webber of pot. The truth,

according to Young, is much less dramatic. He was in Florida, fishing with a

buddy and sharing a joint. His friend praised the marijuana, which Montgomery

had given to Young as a free sample. A few days later the friend called Young

and asked if there was any more of "that good stuff." Young thought there was.

His friend then called a friend, who called another friend: a buyer in New

York. Young claims that he actually received only a fraction of the $70,000 fee

alleged in court. He did not really know either the buyer or the seller. Once

the two got together, they did the natural thing--eliminated the middleman.

"They cheated me!" Young said, laughing hard.<p>



<p>



Although he has always loved to smoke marijuana, Young never thought much about

it until coming to prison. Now he is an authority on the subject, a fan of the

authors Jack Herer and Chris Conrad, who believe that growing hemp can help

protect the environment. The use of its fibers for paper, Young thinks, could

save millions of trees, and its distillation into alcohol-based fuels could end

the world's energy shortage. Young is busy in prison designing a Harley

Davidson that will run entirely on marijuana--"the Hempster." Much to his

family's distress, Young was recently sent to "the Hole," Leavenworth's

disciplinary building, for smoking marijuana in prison. The marijuana at

Leavenworth is quite good, though expensive, he says. Most illegal drugs are

easily obtained in Leavenworth, including hashish, a rarity elsewhere in the

Midwest.<p>



<p>



I asked Young the question that had been on my mind for weeks: Why didn't he

cooperate with the prosecutors, when refusing to talk seemed to guarantee a

life sentence? "It crossed through my mind a lot, trying to decide," he said.

"But there's two ways I look at it. I feel kind of proud to have principles.

And I'm glad I never lost that. But on the other hand, I can't really brag too

much, because I didn't have anybody to give them. Who was I going to give

them?" I suggested that they just wanted a name, some token of cooperation. The

only name Young could provide was that of his fishing buddy; and in the end, he

could not do it. "This guy has nothing," he said. "This guy couldn't buy half

an ounce of marijuana, okay?" Young understands why the other defendants

behaved as they did: "When you're talking the kind of time that they were

passing out, you expect anybody to do what they can to fend for themselves." As

for him, "No, I wouldn't do it any other way."<p>



<p>



The worst thing about Leavenworth, for Young, is the noise, "the constant roar

of hundreds of people talking." His cell offers no escape from it, from voices

echoing off the steel and concrete, day and night. Should Young ever be

released, the first thing he plans to do is go fishing--"I'm sure now that I'm

locked up, the bass have come out." He feels great bitterness toward his

prosecutors. "Someone who'd do what they're doing is capable of doing anything.

. . . They've only proved I'm capable of smoking a joint, or of introducing a

guy to another guy who needs some pounds. That's the most they've proved me

capable of. What they're doing, they're destroying these families and passing

out life sentences, taking people's lives, putting children on the street--I

mean horrendous acts." He laughed. "I don't know of anyone that would do

anything that malicious for a salary." He has no complaints about the

corrections officers--men with families, working toward a pension, who daily

walk unarmed amid scores of violent inmates. "I wouldn't take their job for

nothing in the world," he said. "Sometimes I wonder if they realize how bad a

situation they're in--you know, really." Despite it all, Young expressed a

touching faith in the Constitution: "We're just going through a bad period . .

. but I believe the Constitution can whip that."<p>



<p>



When our time was up, a prison official gave Young a friendly tap on the

shoulder and said, "Come on, buddy." Moments later a heavy door closed, and

Mark Young was gone.<p>

<font size=4><b>Dissension in the System</font></b><p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>OM Dawson has a folksy, small-town manner and a cluttered, unpretentious

office, both of which disguise the fact that he is a very successful criminal

attorney who has been admitted to the bar in every federal circuit. Dawson grew

up in the town of Leavenworth, and is arguing Young's appeal. The issue before

the court concerns how much marijuana Young could reasonably have foreseen

would be produced by the conspiracy. Dawson and Assistant U.S. Attorney Donna

Eide have been sparring over plants and pounds and the proper equation for

turning one into the other; at times even the judges on the court of appeals

get confused. The dispute might seem worthy of an Abbott and Costello routine

if its outcome were not going to determine a man's fate. The gray-haired Dawson

is a lifelong Republican who earns a living representing drug offenders, among

others. But he has become profoundly disillusioned with the war on drugs. "It

is corrupting everything it touches," he told me. At sentencing the degree of a

defendant's guilt often seems less important than his willingness to hand over

assets and name others. "I've had kingpins walk free," Dawson admitted. In a

case handled by another lawyer, a major cocaine dealer with a fleet of Learjets

testified against "everybody he ever met," Dawson said, and served less than

four years in prison, despite being caught with 20,000 kilos of cocaine. "It's

just the guy who doesn't cooperate who then gets everybody else's time. It's

just the way it works. And they finally will run into some poor guy who says,

just like Mark, 'I'm not going to do it. I've got principles.' Well, then,

fine. You take all their time. And that's really about the way it works."

Guilty pleas are what keep a legal system that is overwhelmed with drug cases

functioning. In certain situations, Dawson believes, an innocent person is

better off pleading guilty: "If you don't plead and you bet wrong, the

sentences are just too high to serve."<p>



<p>



Anti-drug mandatory-minimum sentences have created dissension in the federal

legal system, prompting many judges to seek early retirement. Judge William

Schwarzer, the head of the Federal Judicial Center, believes that the nation

risks losing some of its best judges. In his view, a lack of respect for the

profession, a sentencing process that often reduces judges to the status of

adding machines, a staggering backlog of drug cases, and a widespread sentiment

that judges are not to be trusted in choosing sentences may all combine to

persuade highly qualified people to avoid the bench. Judges were meant to be

impartial arbiters; too often now they are merely bystanders, as U.S. attorneys

administer punishments chosen by Congress. Perhaps a hundred senior federal

judges are currently refusing to hear low-level drug cases prosecuted under

mandatory-minimum laws. One of them, Jack B. Weinstein, of New York's Eastern

District, announced his decision with regret, aware that he might be passing

the "dirty work" to his colleagues. "I need a rest from the oppressive sense of

futility that these drug cases leave," he wrote in his announcement. "I simply

cannot sentence another impoverished person whose destruction has no

discernible effect on the drug trade." Weinstein believes that imprisonment can

serve as a deterrent; in court I watched him rebuke corrupt taxi inspectors and

insist that their plea bargains include prison terms. It is a question of

proportion. In refusing to apply a ten-year mandatory minimum to a poor woman

caught smuggling heroin, Weinstein quoted the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy

Bentham. "Every particle of real punishment that is produced, more than what is

necessary," Bentham wrote, "is just so much misery run to waste."<p>



<p>



Deborah Daniels was the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Indiana from

1988 to 1993. She not only supervised Mark Young's prosecution but also helped

set the Justice Department's sentencing policy during the Bush Administration.

"My position as a prosecutor," she says, "was not to make the laws." Congress

had passed legislation to remove judicial discretion through mandatory minimums

and guidelines. The Justice Department decided that it would be wrong for

prosecutors "to take over that role as judges." The laws were to be fully

enforced as written. Daniels acknowledges that in some districts assistant U.S.

attorneys would "work a case backward," deciding what punishment a defendant

ought to receive and then finding a way to charge for it. "I don't agree with

that. That's cheating. And we didn't cheat in the Southern District of Indiana.

We played it straight. And that's how Mark Young got his sentence." She denies

that the threat of long sentences was used mainly to induce plea bargains: "We

didn't do things like that." The policy of her office was to seek conviction on

the most serious readily provable charge--in every case, without exception.

"The minute you start saying, Well, gee, that's kind of severe for this guy and

what he did," she argues, "then you're deciding what the case is worth."

Daniels believes that Young's sentence is what Congress mandated for that

offense. Many people think it is wrong to give a life sentence when "only

marijuana" is involved. Daniels disagrees. The United States cannot discourage

other countries from exporting cocaine if it is unwilling to fight an illegal

drug produced domestically. "Yes, prisons are expensive," she admits, "but if

we are going to crack down on a serious problem . . . we are going to have to

bear the brunt of that." She does not think the pressure to cooperate has

diminished the quality of testimony in court. And what most people don't

realize about U.S. attorneys, she says, is that they spend a good deal of their

time getting innocent people out of trouble, by declining to file charges. In

Mark Young's case, all things considered, the system worked exactly as

intended.<p>



<p>



Last year Attorney General Janet Reno amended the Thornburgh Memorandum,

allowing U.S. attorneys to take into account the circumstances in a particular

case--a tacit acknowledgment of prosecutorial power. Seeking the maximum

sentence is still the policy of the Justice Department, but exceptions can be

made. Judith Stewart, the new U.S. attorney in Indiana's Southern District, has

vowed to seek "consistency without mathematical regimentation." The Clinton

Administration, however, does not plan any changes in how the war on drugs is

being waged against marijuana. Lee P. Brown, the head of the White House Office

of National Drug Control Policy, recently summarized the Administration's view

this way: "Marijuana, as you know, is a controlled substance. Our position is

that it should remain a controlled substance. We feel that way because it is a

potentially dangerous psychoactive drug, with strong links to medical problems

and negative, or at least high-risk, behavior among its users." Enforcement

policies adopted by the two previous Administrations will continue. The crime

bills recently passed by both houses of Congress include weak "safety-valve"

provisions that will allow judges to waive mandatory-minimum sentences for some

low-level first-time drug offenders, who in return must offer full cooperation.

The crime bills also specify the death penalty for any marijuana offender

caught with 60,000 plants or more.<p>



<p>



One of the great ironies of American drug policy is that anti-drug laws over

the past century have tended to become most punitive long after the use of a

drug has peaked. David Musto, a professor at Yale Medical School and the

pre-eminent historian of American narcotics policy, explains that when drug use

is at its height, so is tolerance; but as drugs recede from middle-class homes,

their users are marginalized, scapegoated, and more readily punished. The price

that society pays for harsh sanctions becomes invisible to most people. Musto

thinks that our nation's drug laws reflect cultural changes after the fact;

though extreme punishments may help to limit a drug epidemic, the principal

causes of its rise and fall lie elsewhere. This theory is supported by recent

history. Marijuana use among the young peaked in 1979; strict federal laws were

passed seven years later, when use had already fallen by 43 percent; and the

explanation most young people gave for quitting marijuana was a concern about

the perceived health risks, not fear of imprisonment. A drug culture is once

again emerging on college campuses, despite the existence of draconian

mandatory minimums. Twelve years after the current war on drugs was declared,

some rough numbers may hint at its cost: $30 billion spent so far at the state,

federal, and local levels to fight marijuana; two billion dollars' worth of

assets seized in marijuana cases; four million Americans arrested for marijuana

offenses; a quarter of a million people convicted of marijuana felonies and

sent to prison for at least a year. Statistics can only suggest a portion of

the truth. As I learned from the families of inmates, the human costs are not

so easily measured.
