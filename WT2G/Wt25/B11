<blockquote>

	<i><font size=4>We must face up to a looming

political problem: the core constituency for the public schools is shrinking.</i></font><p>

	

	

	<pre>

	<font size=5>T</font>he federal census for 1990 confirms something that some of us had suspected:

families with school-aged children make up a surprisingly small percentage of

the U.S. population.<p>



<p>



In 1950, five years after the end of the Second World War, 46.3 percent of

American households had children under eighteen. Ten years later the historic

Baby Boom was at full crest, and families with children were a remarkable 48.4

percent of all American households, just short of a majority.<p>



<p>



But then by 1970 the proportion of households with children was down to 44

percent, and in 1980 it was down to 37.5 percent. In 1990, after a full decade

in which Baby Boomers had had babies themselves, and were joined in the

endeavor by record numbers of new immigrants of childbearing age, the

proportion was down again, to 34.6 percent. Elementary school enrollments have

begun picking up during the past few years, but in most parts of the country

they will not achieve the peak numbers of the past.<p>



<p>



It's in the old industrial states of the Northeast and the Midwest that the new

demographics are most apparent. In New York, households with children were 44.5

percent of the total in 1960, 41.2 percent in 1970, 35.2 percent in 1980, and

31.1 percent in 1990. The figures for Massachusetts were 46.4 percent, 42.4

percent, 35.1 percent, and 32.3 percent; for Illinois 46.3 percent, 43.4

percent, 37.4 percent, and 33.4 percent; and for Michigan 51.4 percent,47.6

percent, 37.7 percent, and 34.9 percent.<p>



<p>



Surprisingly, the Sun Belt states do not rack up the countervailing numbers

that the popular impression might suggest. These places are seeing the

migration of young people from other parts of the country and immigration from

Asia and Latin America--but they also attract senior citizens. The net result:

large overall declines in the proportion of young families from 1960 to 1970

and from 1970 to 1980, with only minor rebounds from 1980 to 1990.<p>



<p>



Numbers like these are not rigidly predictive, but they provide a way of

thinking about the downward-tending fortunes of public education in many

communities. Heads of households with children under eighteen are, after all,

the core constituency for education in this country--not because they are more

enlightened or civic-minded than anybody else but precisely because they are

like everybody else: they think first about their own welfare and that of their

immediate families. When they vote or meet with or talk to their neighbors,

they are likely to have the schools in mind. And when their numbers begin to

decline substantially, the schools will likely suffer.<p>



<p>



The baby dearth has hit the schools of the American suburb hard. The very

community that was such a good place to raise a family in the 1960s is the most

likely to have a large complement of empty-nesters in the 1990s, many of whom

will be less interested in the schools than they once were.<p>



<p>



The district I represent in the Massachusetts state senate includes Belmont, a

middle-class and upper-middle-class suburb of 24,720. Belmont is a wonderful

town, home to many people, once blue-collar, who have moved out over the years

from the urban environs of Cambridge and Boston, and to others who hail from

around the country and have been drawn to professional opportunities in the

nearby cities or along the Route 128 technology belt.<p>



<p>



Belmont takes great pride in both the reputation and the appearance of its

gracefully landscaped high school, complete with duck pond, which lies near the

town center. More than 90 percent of the school's juniors and seniors take the

SATs, the average combined verbal and mathematics score is over a thousand, and

87 percent of the graduating class at least begin a four-year college

education.<p>



<p>



But the Belmont schools are caught in the demographic squeeze. In 1960, the

postwar influx having supplied a stream of young settlers, 42.0 percent of the

households had children under eighteen. Ten years later the figure had declined

to 35.7 percent. It was down to 28.7 percent by 1980 and 26.4 percent by 1990.

Outside observers would hardly call Belmont a retirement community, yet

sometime around 1975 it reached a watershed for an American town: the

proportion of its households containing people over sixty-five exceeded the

proportion of its households with children under eighteen.<p>



<p>



The effects of such a demographic squeeze are manifested subtly, and only over

time. In the twelve years that have passed since Proposition 2 1/2, the

Massachusetts property-tax limitation law, took effect, Belmont town meeting

has never placed a proposal on the ballot to exempt the operating budget of the

schools from the tax cap. Such a proposal, termed an override, would require

the approval of the townspeople in an open election, and the risk of rejection

has always seemed too high.<p>



<p>



As fiscal year 1991 approached, and Belmont town finances began to be very

tight, it was deemed the wiser course to mount an override campaign on the more

unifying issue of funding trash collection, in the knowledge that an exemption

for trash would have the effect of freeing up money for the schools. Even this

question passed by a scant 439 votes out of 5,585 votes cast, after an arduous

effort by proponents of town services. "We'll never do it again," a member of

the League of Women Voters told me with a groan.<p>



<p>



Belmont is a healthy, thriving place, and it may well be that the citizenry

will rally behind its tradition of fine education. But the going will be tough,

because the problem remains: in cities and towns across the country a

demographic bulge once operated to keep the schools at the center of community

life, and now it is gone. Today the presence of kids in every other house on

the street is something out of the past, and the parents of schoolchildren,

middle-class and poor alike, are the country's newest minority group. At a

historic moment when the schools need to be better than ever, they are instead

treading water, even slipping back a bit, and by world standards genuine

excellence is a long way off.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



One has to wonder, then: Will communities like Belmont, composed of growing

proportions of nonparents and empty nesters--people more likely to insist on

quality health care than on quality education--continue to support their

schools? To put the matter simply, will the votes be there? And if they are

not, what does American democracy do then?<p>



<p>



There is an answer, one as old as the republic. In 1787, as the people of the

liberated colonies wrestled with the question of a Constitution for their new

country James Madison wrote "The Advantages of Union," the famous Federalist

Paper in which he proposed to control the effects of faction and the resulting

risk to individuals of mistreatment by local majorities. His recourse was the

intelligent design of government. Madison wrote,<p>



<p>



"The smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller

the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and

execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater

variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of

the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other

citizens...."<p>



<p>



Applying Madison's idea to education by extending state and national

responsibility for the protection of parental minorities might be expected to

stir up a fuss. There is, after all, a long-standing tradition of local control

over the schools. But no one means to abolish the local function; balance is

the issue here--an artful recalibration of roles among the local, state, and

national spheres of American democracy. The vexing question of school finance

cries out for Madisonian thinking. As a modest step toward escaping the tyranny

of local majorities, federal funding for public education should be returned

over time to the level at which it was in 1980--9.8 percent of school

expenditures. This would amount to about $23 billion a year: a good start to

reinvigorating the federal role, especially if the commitment spurred matching

efforts on the part of the states.<p>



<p>



As sensibly Madisonian as it may be, increasing federal spending on education

is not the only option. Why not a federalism swap? If Washington were to divide

its savings from defense cuts and other sources into essentially three

accounts, deficit reduction, economic stimulus, and health care, and adopt a

funding schedule for the third which picked up the state and local portions of

Medicaid as part of a national health insurance scheme, the other tiers of

government would have more than enough money to fund education

reform--including special aid to poor districts--on their own. This would

neatly apportion responsibility: health-care finance at the federal level,

school finance at the state and local levels.<p>



<p>



The deepening political isolation of families with children imperils the aims

of excellence and equity both. A Madisonian solution, its roots deep in the

soil of traditional American thinking, offers us a way out. The Clinton

Administration and Congress should take it.

<blockquote>
	<i><font size=4>Contention between proponents of the "meaning first" and the "phonics

concern</i></font><p>

	<font size=5>I</font>n education no question has produced so much bitter debate for so long as 
this one: What is the best way to teach children to read? It is a critical 
issue, because there is clearly a need for drastic improvement in the way 
our schools do this essential job. As many as 20 percent of Americans 
above the age of sixteen are classified as functionally illiterate--unable 
to use print to perform essential tasks--and the ranks are growing every 
year. Even as the literacy crisis deepens, partisans of different reading 
approaches square off against each other. New teaching fads come and go.

The latest of these fads is known as the whole-language approach to 
literacy. It exposes children to interesting reading and writing at the 
expense of systematically teaching specific reading and writing skills. 
Whole-language teachers, for instance, encourage young students to recite 
along with them as the teachers read aloud from entertaining big-print 
books. One of their central beliefs is that language should be learned 
from "whole to part," with word-recognition skills being picked up by the 
child in the context of actual reading, writing, and "immersion" in a 
print-rich classroom. It is a philosophy that has won the backing of 
influential teachers' organizations, state and local education agencies, 
and tens of thousands of enthusiastic teachers. In Northfield, Illinois, 
for example, a reading specialist, Kenneth Smith, says that ever since the 
town's schools adopted the whole-language approach, a few years ago, "our 
kids are more motivated to read and write, and there's been an upturn in 
comprehension."

Unfortunately, there's little hard evidence to back up such claims across 
the board--and good reason to be concerned about the whole-language method 
when it's used to the exclusion of other approaches. It can deprive 
children, particularly low-income and other disadvantaged students, of the 
intensive instruction in phonics--the study of sound-letter 
relationships--that they need to master reading. "The widespread rush into 
whole language could have real dangers for certain kinds of kids, and it's 
scary to me," says Robert Slavin, a co-director of the Center for Research 
on the Education of Students Placed at Risk, at Johns Hopkins University. 

Evidence is also mounting that the approach may not be all that effective, 
and that its underlying premises may simply be false. Some of the many 
school districts that have tried the whole-language method have been 
attacked by educators and parents for a subsequent drop in test scores. In 
Texas a significant minority of schools have elected to spend their own 
money on phonics-based reading programs rather than use whole-language 
courses funded by the state; in Canada several citizens' groups have been 
formed to protest the widespread adoption of whole-language methods; and 
in England in late 1992 the British Education Secretary, alarmed at 
declining achievement scores, called for a return to instruction in basic 
skills. His action followed an advisory panel's report that derided 
"foolish methods that often lead to poor results," including Britain's 
version of whole-language teaching. Yet the whole-language philosophy 
continues to gain adherents among educators.

To be sure, even some critics of the method concede that traditional 
phonics instruction could benefit from several of the whole-language 
method's innovations, and they are seeking to combine the best of both 
approaches. Common sense would seem to suggest that most teachers should, 
in fact, blend systematic skills instruction with the use of appealing 
literature--and many, in fact, do. But in education, a field too often 
dominated by zealots and crazes, balanced approaches are sometimes harder 
to find than those shaped by the swinging pendulum of pedagogical fashion.

The whole-language method is the latest incarnation of the "meaning-first" 
approach that has warred with the "phonics-first" approach to reading for 
more than a century. The traditional practice was to teach children the 
alphabetic code--the translation of abstract letters into sounds and 
words--before turning to actual reading. This approach was challenged in 
the mid-nineteenth century by Horace Mann, the secretary of the 
Massachusetts Board of Education. With a vehemence not unlike that of 
today's whole-language proponents, Mann denounced the letters of the 
alphabet as "bloodless, ghostly apparitions" that were responsible for 
"steeping [children's] faculties in lethargy." He argued that children 
should be taught whole, meaningful words first, and promoted the 
"look-say" method that by the 1920s had come to dominate American 
education.

In the 1950s, however, the meaning-first approach was itself denounced, in 
bitter, still-resonant political terms, in Rudolf Flesch's best-selling 
book Why Johnny Can't Read. Flesch's broadside led to a wave of 
authoritative new studies. These concluded that reading programs that 
include systematic, intensive phonics instruction work better than those 
that do not. By the early 1970s most schools had returned to an 
essentially phonics-based program. But as the pendulum swung once again, 
these programs found themselves being criticized by some teachers and 
academics for killing off children's interest in reading.

Most of the critics initially directed their fire, with some 
justification, at conventional teaching tools. They denounced worksheets 
used to drill students with tedious rows of words, the "basal readers" 
with their dull Dick-and-Jane-style stories, and reading groups organized 
by ability which stigmatize children and often promote failure.

Whole language supposedly offers an easy way to literacy. Ken Goodman, a 
professor of education at the University of Arizona, is one of the 
whole-language movement's leading academics. He and his colleagues have 
argued over the years that learning written language can be as natural as 
acquiring spoken language, and that children can learn to read primarily 
by figuring out the meaning of words in context. "Good readers don't read 
word by word," Goodman says. "They construct meaning from the [entire] 
text." Indeed, "accuracy is not an essential goal of reading."

Whole-language advocates believe that children should learn at their own 
pace and shouldn't be pushed too hard too soon. "We don't believe that 
phonics should be taught through 'skill and drill,'" says Bess Altwerger, 
an associate professor of education at Towson State University, in 
Baltimore. Phonics and related skills are supposed to be learned by the 
child in the context of actual reading and writing. The teacher should 
intrude only minimally into this process of discovery, at most waiting for 
the occasional "teachable moment" to pass along reading tips. As Goodman 
has said, "One cannot reconcile direct instruction with natural learning."

Adherents also contend that whole language is the best approach for 
minorities and disadvantaged students. "We don't lose struggling readers, 
because they don't get a defeatist attitude," says Mary Katsafanas, a 
talented and dedicated first-grade teacher in suburban Carroll County, 
Maryland. A movement publication, The Whole Language Teachers Newsletter, 
underscores that attitude: it recommends teaching children confronted by 
an unfamiliar word to "skip it, use prior information. . . . or put in 
another word that makes sense." It warns, "Don't sound-it-out." Although 
Katsafanas does sometimes gently suggest that students use letter sounds 
to figure out words, she sees the mistakes her students make as part of a 
journey toward literacy rather than as errors to be criticized. During a 
visit to her class I heard a child read aloud from a rudimentary picture 
book; the girl wasn't corrected when she read the word "hug" instead of 
"cuddle." "She has the concept of the story," Katsafanas said later. This 
child lagged behind her classmates in both reading and writing.

The need for any explicit, systematic phonics instruction is a "myth," 
says Marie Carbo, the president of the National Reading Styles Institute, 
in Syosset, New York. Karen Smith, the associate executive director of the 
National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), says, "Phonics is just one 
part of the reading process. The child learns surrounded by language. It's 
just like oral language: through interaction with other language users, 
all of a sudden things start making sense." Besides the NCTE, the 
International Reading Association and other teachers' groups have endorsed 
the tenets of the whole-language movement. An independent organization, 
The Whole Language Umbrella, claims about 25,000 members and 450 local 
chapters (or teachers' support groups) in North America. The 
whole-language method is now used by perhaps a fifth of all teachers of 
reading, with an even larger proportion adapting elements of it, such as 
the greater use of authentic children's literature and the decreased use 
of intensive phonics.

The whole-language approach is also favored by most teachers' colleges and 
university-level education programs. Its influence is so pervasive that in 
1987 a survey of forty-three texts used to train teachers of reading found 
that none advocated systematic phonics instruction--and only nine even 
mentioned that there was a debate on the issue. Some form of the 
whole-language ideology has been adopted by more than a dozen state 
education agencies. 

Despite the spread of whole-language instruction, research and experience 
not only fail to demonstrate its superiority but also make a persuasive 
case for the importance of phonics. 

Since 1981 only a few dozen studies in reputable education journals have 
even attempted to compare the reading scores achieved by the 
whole-language method with those of other methods of teaching reading, and 
the conclusions are contradictory, at best. A 1989 overview paper in the 
Review of Educational Research found that the scanty whole-language 
research and the more extensive studies on its predecessor, the "language 
experience" approach, when taken together, show that they produced 
somewhat worse results in reading comprehension and worse results with 
disadvantaged students than traditional methods did. A similar 1991 
University of Maryland survey, published this fall in Educational 
Psychologist, looked at whole-language research and found that most of the 
studies examined demonstrated no difference in outcomes--but also were too 
poorly designed to have much validity in any event. (There are exceptions: 
Penny Freppon, at the University of Cincinnati, for example, has done 
credible controlled studies that seem to support the idea that whole 
language can affect some reading measurements.) 

The federal government, philanthropic foundations, and universities have 
sponsored other major studies on reading. Though these were not intended 
to compare whole language and phonics, the findings have been generally 
supportive of the intensive phonics programs derided by whole-language 
proponents. Low-income and slow students appear to benefit especially from 
explicit phonics instruction. These findings have been summarized in such 
reports as The Great Debate, by the Harvard education professor Jeanne 
Chall, the Commission on Reading's Becoming a Nation of Readers, and a 
1990 report sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, Beginning to 
Read, by the psychologist Marilyn Adams. This last report concludes that 
"the vast majority of [program comparison] studies indicated that 
approaches including intensive, explicit phonics resulted in comprehension 
skills that are at least comparable to, and word recognition and spelling 
skills that are significantly better than those that do not."

Phonics alone, of course, is not sufficient to promote strong reading 
skills. As Adams emphasized in Beginning to Read, children need both 
direct skills instruction and exposure to interesting reading.

Adams's report sought and found common ground between the whole- language 
and phonics camps--but it didn't heal the rift between the extremists. 
Those partial to phonics are not, for the most part, the ones who have 
proved intransigent. At a meeting of the International Reading Association 
four years ago, for instance, Ken Goodman attacked Adams as a "vampire" 
who threatened the literacy of America's youth. Constance Weaver, of 
Western Michigan University, and other whole-language proponents question 
the reliability of pro-phonics research. Indeed, many whole-language 
advocates don't accept conventional standards of proof, and criticize 
virtually any reading test for being an artificial assessment of a narrow 
set of skills. Professor Carole Edelsky, of Arizona State University, in a 
widely discussed paper in Educational Researcher, rejected calls for 
rigorous quantitative or test-score-based research on the whole-language 
approach as an "outrageous" effort to impose an old "paradigm" on the 
movement. "Test-score evidence doesn't tell you what students actually do 
when they read," Edelsky argues. She and others favor a qualitative 
approach called "kid-watching," which uses such devices as free-form 
essays and portfolios that measure student progress over time--evaluation 
tools that are gaining mainstream acceptance. But many of the movement 
leaders remain hostile to controlled studies or other concrete measures of 
proof.

There have been troubling reports from the field about whole language. 
Reading scores of first-graders in San Diego dropped by about half when 
whole language was introduced there in 1990. One school-board member 
complained to the San Diego Union, "From parents I get lines like, 'You're 
experimenting with my kid.' I hope we didn't make a mistake--but I feel in 
my gut that we have." 

In Houston in the fall of 1991, eight inner-city elementary schools asked 
the school district to allow them to return to phonics-based instruction 
after a few years of trying a whole-language-style program. "Last year's 
reading scores were the lowest in twenty years," LaSalle Donnell, the 
principal of Houston's Douglass Elementary School, said at the time. "If 
the kids can't decipher words, they can't enjoy a whole-language program." 
During the 1992-1993 school year, after an intensive phonics program was 
adopted, the school's scores on a state reading test rose an astonishing 
48 points. At that time 98 percent of third-graders were reading at or 
above grade level, and the school's reading scores are still among the 
best in the city. 

The most disturbing reports have come from urban school districts with 
significant numbers of low-income and minority students (not particularly 
surprising, given the studies showing that disadvantaged students do worse 
in programs that make little use of phonics), in large measure because, 
unlike most middle-class children, they aren't getting much letter-sound 
instruction at home. Yet there are some signs that even middle-class 
students, who often have received informal tutoring in phonics from their 
parents, may suffer in certain whole-language classrooms.

For this reason the tale of the Cape Elizabeth, Maine, schools merits 
attention. For about five years a whole-language program--without any 
systematic phonics instruction at all before third grade--was offered in 
this small middle-class suburb. Then some parents began complaining that 
their younger children weren't reading as well as their older ones had. A 
new superintendent, Constance Goldman, responded to those concerns by 
conducting district-wide standardized testing for second-grade students in 
1991. The tests, although given several months earlier than usual, offered 
a worrisome, if rough, snapshot of students in trouble: 42 percent of the 
second-graders read below grade level, a far higher proportion of 
low-scoring students than in comparable communities. Goldman, disturbed by 
the results, moved to create a more balanced curriculum, keeping elements 
of the whole-language philosophy but adding more direct skills 
instruction. Reading scores improved. "At some point you have to set 
standards," she says now.

If questions can be raised about an exclusive reliance on the 
whole-language method in practice, it should not be surprising that they 
can also be raised about it in theory.

Since the 1960s Ken Goodman and Frank Smith, for many years a psychology 
professor at the University of Victoria, in British Columbia, have argued 
that skillful reading involves getting meaning largely from the context of 
the entire passage, rather than reading word by word. By sampling words 
and parts of words, readers engage in a "psycholinguistic guessing game" 
that enables them to predict the words they'll encounter. Sounding out 
words plays only a small role, Goodman and Smith say, because it's too 
cumbersome for the human mind to process every letter and every word.

Given this theory, the playing down of phonics and the emphasis on 
guessing words makes a kind of sense. But in the two decades since the 
whole-language philosophy first became influential in academic circles, a 
considerable amount of research has been published showing Goodman's and 
Smith's psycholinguis-tic theories to be wrong. Here is a brief survey. 

* Contrary to the whole-language belief that readers "sample" text, 
skillful readers actually read virtually every word and every letter of 
the texts they encounter. That's the basic conclusion of 
computer-monitored eye-movement research by Keith Rayner, of the 
University of Massachusetts, and other scholars. Skilled readers are able 
to breeze through texts effortlessly because their knowledge of phonics 
has made word recognition automatic--thus freeing their minds to focus on 
meaning.

* The critical reading ability is word identification, rather than the use 
of context to figure out words. Charles Perfetti, of the University of 
Pittsburgh, for instance, has shown that readers who perform poorly when 
reading words out of context also do poorly at reading comprehension. "The 
skilled reader has such automatic facility at identifying words that he 
doesn't need context," says Frank Vellutino, the director of the Child 
Research and Study Center at the University of Albany. Philip Gough, of 
the University of Texas, has found that even skilled readers correctly 
guess no more than one in four words missing from a text. Whole language's 
emphasis on context was undermined in a different way in December of 1991, 
when the Journal of Educational Psychology published a study challenging 
an oft-cited 1965 experiment by Ken Goodman. The original experiment had 
found that children made 60 to 80 percent more errors when reading words 
out of context than when reading them in context. But Tom Nicholson, a 
senior lecturer in education at the University of Waikato, in New Zealand, 
repeated Goodman's work and determined that Goodman had failed to 
distinguish properly between good and poor readers; it was only the 
younger and poorer readers who made significantly more errors reading 
words out of context.

* Understanding letter-sound correspondences is indispensable to skilled 
reading. Frank Smith has argued, "To the fluent reader, the alphabetic 
principle is completely irrelevant." In fact Jeanne Chall, of Harvard, and 
other researchers have demonstrated that two powerful predictors of future 
reading success are a knowledge of the alphabet and an awareness of the 
speech sounds that make up words--the very skills that are often lacking 
in disadvantaged students when they enter first grade. 

Research of this kind, though, hasn't prompted whole-language theorists or 
their followers to modify their beliefs. Goodman argues that researchers 
in the phonics camp use short written passages and artificial settings 
that do not reflect real-world conditions. "They can play games in the 
laboratory," he says, "but teachers know that that's not the way people 
read." Frank Smith dismisses most of the computer-based research on 
thinking and reading as "irrelevant and misleading."

Whatever its limitations, the whole-language approach does have something 
to offer. Its stress on reading enjoyable children's literature rather 
than dull primers is surely worthwhile (though little more than common 
sense). Whole language also offers a supportive and tolerant atmosphere in 
which to learn to read. The emphasis on early writing wins broad support 
among the various reading factions, because it can help improve reading 
and thinking skills.

For its part, traditional phonics instruction also has limitations. 
Although the use of genuine literature and writing assignments in schools 
has grown, a majority of classrooms still devote too much of their 
reading-instruction time to simplistic workbooks and mind-numbing drills. 
Learning phonics this way is dull and time-consuming. Equally dubious is 
the widely advertised "Hooked on Phonics" program, which promises miracles 
for beginning readers, young and old alike. In 1991 a panel of reading 
experts questioned the effectiveness of this method, since it concentrates 
on teaching letter sounds without offering any meaningful reading. 

Fortunately, a few promising programs have combined quick, accessible 
phonics instruction with whole-language-style activities. Perhaps the 
clearest demonstration that children benefit from such a combination is a 
program for troubled readers called Reading Recovery, designed by the New 
Zealand educator Marie Clay. For thirty minutes a day over an average of 
sixteen weeks, a specially trained teacher works with children 
individually to build their confidence by exposing them to short, 
charming, gradually more difficult books; mini-lessons in writing; and 
magnetic letters that the children play with to form words. The program is 
widely used in Ohio, Illinois, California, Texas, and New York, among 
other places. Early research showed that roughly 85 percent of Reading 
Recovery graduates were reading at levels comparable to their peers' up to 
three years later--a rate of success that no other remedial program comes 
close to matching. 

Reading Recovery costs a few thousand dollars per child, but its eclectic 
principles could be applied less expensively across entire classrooms. 
Unfortunately, whole-language extremists aren't eager to let that happen. 
The program itself, admittedly, has been embraced by both phonics and 
whole-language advocates, with the latter being particularly likely to 
cite Reading Recovery's success as another example of their achievements. 
But Marie Clay says, "No, this isn't part of whole language." The truth 
that whole-language purists don't want to admit is that Reading Recovery's 
success is due to its shrewd combination of teaching strategies from 
different pedagogical camps, including the use of phonics. So they deride 
those who are trying to forge just such a blend of methods. "It's 
asinine," Ken Goodman says. "We're not going to solve anything by trying a 
little of this and a little of that."

But it may be exactly that diverse approach that stands the best chance of 
creating classroom after classroom in which everyone can read.

	<font size=5>T</font>he war is over. Reconstruction is now the world's absorbing interest. Much of

the economic and political structure of modern society must be recast. The

rearrangement of the map of Europe and of international relations, at the Peace

Conference, will be but early steps in a process of readjustment on which the

world's thought will be centred for the next twenty years. This reconstruction

problem is not a reestablishment of the socio-economic relations which obtained

before the war. It is reconstruction. If the war had ended two years ago, its

issues might have been confined to international politics; but in the last two

years the thought of the Western world has grappled with fundamentals. The

laborers and peasants of Russia, the factory-hands of England, and the common

laborers of America have been fired with a vision of a new world in which their

past sufferings will be replaced by a greater degree of welfare than they have

yet enjoyed. <p>



<p>



<p>



Many people believe that America's reconstruction labor-problem is a struggle

between capitalists and organized labor over the question whether or not labor

will retain the advances in organization and wages which it has obtained during

the war. In my judgment, that struggle is but the opening skirmish of a much

further-reaching contest. Millions of workers have been aroused to ask whether

democracy is a reality when it is accompanied by the amount of unemployment,

low wages, bad housing, and the like, which have existed up to the present

time. The peasants of Russia and of other countries are asking whether the

land-systems of the past are compatible with democracy. In a word, the aroused

self-consciousness of classes heretofore submerged will force a widespread

struggle over fundamentals of social organization.<p>



<p>



<p>



The world has neither comprehended nor felt the full power of the forces

underlying the radical socialistic movements shaking Europe to-day. These

movements are due to the cumulative discontents of generations. The Bolsheviki,

the I.W.W., and similar organizations may be crushed as organizations, but this

will not stifle the revolt they express. These organizations are concrete

manifestations of the economic discontent of the peasant and laboring classes,

and discontent is not cured by force. In ancient times the control of society

was in the hands of landlords. During the later Middle Ages the capitalistic

class emerged and compelled the landlords to divide social control with them.

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the skilled mechanics and small

farmers forced a place for themselves in the political and economic control of

society. Now the laborers of Europe and America, with the peasants of Italy and

Russia, have emerged into self-consciousness, and demand participation in the

management of the world's life. The uprising of these groups is due to causes

that have been operating over a long period of time, in Russia, Germany,

France, England, Italy, the United States, and lesser nations: causes too

fundamental to be dismissed with superficial concessions or crushed by

political or economic force. Though they may lose in their early efforts, they

will continue the struggle until they win self-government and justice. <p>



<p>



<p>



Those of us who believe in democracy, as contrasted with autocracy and anarchy,

should waste no time. It is our task to discover the real causes of these

movements, and to point out the social reconstruction which will remove them.

It is idle for us to waste time denouncing Trotsky, Lenin, or other leaders.

Those leaders have simply focused heartaches. It is the causes of the

heartaches which should interest scientific men who believe in democracy and

justice. We do not defend the excesses which accompany these

movements--excesses due in part to a long-repressed sense of injustice, in part

to ignorance, in part to criminal leadership, in part to the fact that criminal

and tough elements gravitate into such movements, to use them for their own

ends. But we do insist that an uprising involving so much of the world's area

and so many millions of men could arise only because of widespread, common

grievances. One of those grievances, though it will be formulated by them in

language which describes its results rather than the causes of those results,

has been the labor-supply of modern capitalism.<p>



<p>



<p>



I. OUR PRE-WAR LABOR-SUPPLY POLICY<p>



<p>



Capitalists, and too many economists, have thought of labor as a commodity, and

of labor-supply as one of the instrumentalities conveniently provided to help

the capitalist grind out products and profits. Labor has been a factor in

production. Their thought has conceived the workman as a laborer rather than as

a father, husband, and citizen. The human has been subordinated to the

economic. But the worker has seen himself in an opposite fashion. To him, his

home and personal life were the important things, his labor but an incidental,

necessary experience of his life. They saw him as a tool in production; he saw

himself as a citizen. They saw no reason why he should not be satisfied when he

got his wages; he saw no reason for being satisfied unless he shared in the

determination of the conditions, economic and political, under which he

lived.<p>



<p>



<p>



It is this fundamental conflict in point of view which has made it so difficult

for the employer and the worker to reach a common ground of agreement. One has

thought in terms of business; the other in terms of human nature. <p>



<p>



<p>



The labor-supply policy of Europe and America has been a very simple one--the

maintenance of a reserve of labor adequate for the employers' needs in their

most busy periods, but for which they assumed no responsibility when they were

not actually employing the workers. To one who thinks of labor as a commodity,

a factor in production, an economic complement to land, capital, and

management, the idea of a labor-reserve is as natural as the idea of a

capital-reserve or a land-reserve, and there is no more reason that labor

should expect continuous employment than there is that capital or land should

expect continuous remunerative utilization.<p>



<p>



<p>



But to one who thinks of labor in terms of personalities, the idea of a

labor-reserve looks entirely different. To him a labor-reserve means fathers

out of employment, children underfed, sick mothers without medical attention,

increased infant mortality, families in debt, the coal-bin empty, the landlord

threatening eviction. It means working efficiency deteriorated by idleness, the

breaking down of regular working habits, the deterioration of mankind. He knows

that, to the men and the women who constitute that labor-reserve, their

economic situation means suffering part of the time, worry all the time, and

life-failure in tens of thousands of cases every year. The uprising which is

shaping the economic world to-day demands that we now begin to think of

labor-reserves and others of our economic customs from the workers' point of

view; that we reconstruct our society on some plan that will give all men a

chance for happiness and success, all babies a chance for survival, all

children a chance for proper care and schooling.<p>



<p>



<p>



The large labor-reserve or surplus which has been persistently with us in

America is largely due to four facts: --<p>



<p>



(1) A fluctuating but unceasing inflow of immigrant labor;<p>



<p>



(2) An unorganized labor market;<p>



<p>



(3) A decentralization of the labor-surplus; and<p>



<p>



(4) A rapid, wasteful turnover of labor.<p>



<p>



<p>



These four are closely related. They interact upon each other. The effects of

each one are in part a cause and in part a result of the other three.<p>



<p>



<p>



1. Immigration has been largely the response to an active demand for labor in

America. We have steadily drawn from Europe supplies of labor brought to

maturity, or near maturity, in foreign countries. In the fifteen years

immediately preceding the war they increased our net population by about ten

millions. In prosperous years, the volume of immigration was much larger than

in bad years. The wave fluctuated, but the human tide continued to flow. And

yet, in every year and month and on every day in which these millions were

coming, there were idle workmen on the streets of every city in America.

Abundant supplies of land, rich natural resources, and expanding industries

continually called for labor for their utilization. Nevertheless, every morning

of the year found idle men at tens of thousands of factory-gates, hanging

around employment offices, or pacing the streets. Labor surplus has been as

ever-present as labor shortage. Investigation after investigation of employment

conditions has demonstrated a continuing supply of idle men in America.

Employers have lacked men at the same time that men have lacked work.<p>



<p>



<p>



It does not necessarily follow that the accretions of population due to

immigration produced a surplus of labor in America that could not be employed.

Our industries have been developing with marvelous rapidity in the last quarter

century. But the facts are that there have never been less than a million idle

men, and often five or six millions, at a time during the last twenty years.

This continuing surplus has been due in part to the lack of adjustment of

immigration to our varying labor needs. But it has also been due in part to the

fact that the labor we have is not properly distributed, in part to the fact

that the labor-reserve is decentralized, and in part to the excessive turnover

of labor which has obtained in our industries.<p>



<p>



<p>



2. Our unorganized labor market has made it impossible for employers to get

labor from any central agency as they get capital from the banking system. they

have had to depend upon the picking up of labor wherever they could find it

lying around loose. If they could not find the kind of a man they wanted out of

employment, their only recourse was to patronize some private employment

agency, or to steal the man from another employer. Both policies were followed,

even by reputable concerns. During the war the government established an

employment service, which is trying to organize the labor market; but we must

not lose sight of the facts that that service is a piece of war-machinery

rather than a piece of industrial machinery, and that it was not established to

help solve either the employers' or the employees' employment problem, but to

facilitate the transfer of labor from non-essential to essential industries in

war-time. It has a war-function, not an industrial function. We sincerely hope

that the efforts now being made to develop the United States Employment Service

into a permanent system of control over the employment situation will be

successful, but that consummation has not yet been attained.<p>



<p>



<p>



3. The third characteristic of our labor-supply which permitted labor-surplus

and unfilled labor-demand to co-exist, was the decentralized character of our

labor-reserves. Inasmuch as there was no organized labor market, and as

immigration continually replenished the labor-supply, each American employer

and each locality developed a local labor-reserve. Each employer expected as a

matter of course that there would be idle men at his factory-gate to-morrow

morning--every morning. And there were. He based his production policy upon

that expectation. Unless there was such a reserve at his place of business, or

in his immediate locality, he complained of labor-shortage. In his mind,

consciously or unconsciously, was the idea that he was entitled to have on hand

at all times enough workers to man his enterprise at maximum capacity, even if

he did not run the business at maximum capacity more than thirty days a year.

He expected that those who did his hiring would be able to engage from an

assembled group the men best suited to his work, and thought it the natural

thing that laborers should compete with each other for the jobs he had to

offer. In other words, American business has been carried on on the theory that

men will work for short periods.<p>



<p>



4. A rapid turnover or shifting of labor has been inevitable, with the

unregulated immigration, unorganized labor market, and decentralized

labor-reserve which we have described.<p>



<p>



Labor has passed through our industries rather than into them. A relatively

small number of progressive employers have inaugurated labor policies which

hold their labor force; but most employers hire two, three, or four men during

a year to fill one work place. They clamor for more men, while they let those

they have slip through their fingers.<p>



<p>



<p>



II. THE EFFECT OF THE WAR ON THE LABOR-SUPPLY <p>



<p>



Into this situation came the war. In 1914, 1,218,480 immigrants came to the

United States. The total immigration of the next four years was but 1,031,547,

or 186,933 less in 1914, and 166,345 less then in 1913. Each year of the war

immigration decreased. It fell from 326,700 in 1915 to 110,618 in 1918. In

1915, immigration gave us a net increase of population of nearly 123,000; in

1918, of but 16,033. During these four years 494,701 aliens departed from this

country, which left us with a net increase of populations by immigration during

the war of 536,846, or about 134,000 a year. The net immigration of 1913 was

889,702; of 1914, 915,142. The war decreased immigration's contribution to our

labor-supply about 85 per cent. It is not certain that our net increase of

population by immigration during the war equaled the number of Americans who

entered the Allied armies before April, 1917, went to Canada to take the place

of Canadians who had gone to the front, and went to Europe to help in the Red

Cross and similar work for the Allies. Immigration during the war is therefore

of negligible importance as a factor in our labor market. <p>



<p>



On the other hand, several million men were withdrawn from employment in

America for military, Red Cross, Y.M.C.A., and similar war-work. Their places

were taken in part by men and women who had not previously been engaged in

economic activities, and in part by absorbing into employment much of the idle

labor-surplus.<p>



<p>



<p>



During the war we experienced a considerable decrease in the nation's supply of

labor in the face of the war's increase in demand for labor. We needed more,

had less, and in effect received none from outside. What happened? By better

distribution of what we had, we manned our war-industries. We did not fill

every place which needed a man, but we were not crippled by a lack of labor.

Yet more significant: we still had labor-surpluses. It is true that many of the

workers idle in war-time were men of low quality, but by no means all of them

were. Throughout the war honest, competent workmen were seeking work at

practically all times. Some of them were not fitted for the jobs which happened

to be open; some were too far away; some did not know where the opportunities

to obtain work were. Unfilled labor-demands and unused labor-surpluses existed

side by side as in normal times.<p>



<p>



<p>



III. POST-WAR LABOR POLICY <p>



<p>



All of these facts bear vitally on the after-the-war situation. In the first

place, they suggest that American industry does not need nearly as many

laborers in the country in proportion to the output as it has always had. It is

beyond dispute that our industries have been careless in their labor policies.

It likewise seems clear that one reason for their carelessness has been the

supply of idle workers who were at their doors practically all the time. The

employer did not think as much about labor conservation as he did about capital

conservation, because labor was easy to get but capital was hard to get. It was

when labor became relatively scarce, that employers in general became

interested in reducing labor turnover, in maintaining labor efficiency, in

paying good wages, in reducing hours, in providing better houses and working

conditions. The world-war period was the first period in American history when

the interests of the common laborer received serious consideration.<p>



<p>



<p>



The question which now confronts us is: Shall we endeavor after the war to

revert to the old labor-supply policy; or shall we develop constructive

policies which will enable our industries to carry on production with smaller

labor-reserves?<p>



<p>



<p>



The termination of war-industries is, of course, throwing many workers out of

employment. There can be little question that more people will be out of

employment this winter than last. There is no doubt in my mind, from the

evidence I have obtained, that there are more out of work now than were out of

work last year at this time. Anyone familiar with the industrial readjustments

which occurred during the war-period knows that it would be impossible for our

industries to return to a peace basis without temporarily throwing many workmen

out of employment. Demobilized soldiers and sailors will add to the number of

the unemployed, in spite of the efforts being made to absorb them into

industry; but the dislocation of industrial workers working in purely war-time

industries and in industries heavily loaded with war-orders is the more serious

aspect of the situation. We appreciate the efforts of government officials and

leading business men to steady industry during the period of readjustment; but

it is untrue to say that men are not being thrown out of employment by the

termination of the war, and it is untrue to say that every returned soldier and

sailor is finding, or will find, a job awaiting him. The number of unemployed

in the country has been increasing steadily since the termination of the war.

Both the time of year and the suddenness of peace make it inevitable. Efforts

to camouflage the situation will only make it worse. Honesty requires that we

recognize that we have a serious problem to face this winter, in the matter of

replacing unemployed workers in employment.<p>



<p>



<p>



Returning to our discussion of the labor-supply situation during the coming

years, as contrasted simply with the situation of this winter, we wish now to

point out that the immigration question is a vital consideration. Before the

war, immigration provided a steady stream of labor to maintain the

decentralized labor-reserves; and in the immediate future, both the

probabilities of immigration and the policy which we are to advocate for the

regulation of immigration are of vital importance. Those who wish to

reestablish the pre-war situation will seek to stimulate immigration. Those who

believe that reduced immigration is desirable will advocate the maintenance of

our present immigration laws or the enactment of more stringent ones. It is my

belief that immigration from Europe will decrease after the war, but that that

decrease will not be a menace to our industrial and commercial advancement. In

the long run, I believe that it will, instead, be a benefit.<p>



<p>



<p>



The New York Evening Post estimated that the total fatalities in the European

armies amounted to approximately ten million men. The permanent disablements

would in all probability bring the figures for labor-loss up to twelve million

or more. These were men in the prime of life, of the type who emigrate to

America. The civilian casualties will certainly equal the military ones, when

we take into account the deliberate slaughter of large numbers of people in

Armenia, Serbia, Roumania, Poland, Belgium, and France; the increased

death-rates of women and children due to lack of food, shelter, and medical

care; and the lowered birth-rate. Some competent observers, such as Mr. Hoover,

believe that the civilian death-rate may more than double the military loss

before the effects of the struggle have terminated. The total population of

Europe is approximately four hundred and thirty million, which would mean that

approximately five per cent of the population, and probably eight per cent of

the workers, lost their lives in the war. In other words, the war caused a

reduction of the population in Europe from three to five times as large as it

would have suffered by emigration to North and South America during the four

years, if peace had continued. Approximately forty per cent, or about four

hundred thousand a year on the average, of the immigrants to America have been

males of military age. Probably one hundred thousand more went to South

America. Europe's loss of man-power--that is, of men in the prime of life--was,

therefore, five times as great on account of the war as it would have been on

account of emigration. Now, if twenty men are lost in each locality during four

years where four were lost before, the discrepancy cannot but affect the number

of persons available for emigration to foreign lands. It would look as if

European emigration of America must be checked immediately after the war,

although other peculiarities of the situation--such as shortage of capital in

Europe and high war-taxes--may increase the tendency to emigrate.<p>



<p>



<p>



There are many in this country who realize this probability of a reduced

European immigration, who are turning longing eyes toward Asia. They will

reopen the question of Oriental immigration if they get the opportunity. It is

not improbable that they will endeavor to amend our immigration laws at this

session of Congress. They are clinging to the policy of providing a

labor-surplus for each employer, which will enable him to man his plant at his

own convenience, carry on his business with the same violent fluctuations of

employment as in the past, and keep down the rate of wages. This effort to

reopen our gates to Oriental immigration is nothing less than suicidal. It

probably could not be done openly: organized labor's resistance would be too

strong to permit that. But if it should be done, either openly or

underhandedly, it would bring the whirlwinds of the workers' wrath about our

heads, and develop a hatred of our economic system, and even of our government,

in millions.<p>



<p>



<p>



The sufferings which the workingmen have endured in the past because of

irregular employment have been many times greater than was necessary. They are

among the deep-seated causes of bitterness among the workers, and they are a

sin against humanity for which our civilization will pay a high price if they

are allowed to continue. The thought of the workers is in a critical state. As

yet, only a small minority have entirely lost faith in our economic system. If

our reconstruction policies eliminate avoidable industrial hardships, the

workers' faith in democracy, political and industrial, will be maintained. If

we try to revert to the old system of making labor but an agency of capital, a

storm is going to break--if not now, at no distant date.<p>



<p>



<p>



I am not certain that stoppage of immigration for ten years would retard our

industrial development. It is certain that we have never obtained the maximum

possible output from our wage-earners. Irregularity of employment, lack of

training, and lack of proper care of their health, have prevented them from

attaining their potential efficiency. If our labor-supply decreases while our

need for labor increases or maintains itself, the result will unquestionably be

a rapid development of industrial training. This was what enabled us to meet,

at least in part, our shortage of skilled labor during the war. If, in the face

of a decreased immigration, we devote ourselves to constructive labor policies

which will increase the technical skill of our laboring population, reduce

labor-turnover, and maintain the laborers' health, character, and intelligence,

we shall meet the need both of industry and of the workers for a higher

standard of living. For it goes without saying, that a rise in the general

efficiency of labor will enable wages to remain at a higher level than if the

pre-war condition is revived.<p>



<p>



<p>



Of course, immigration will not cease, and the industrial expansion to which we

look forward when the first after-effects of the war have passed will not find

us with a seriously decreased supply of workmen. There is certainly no prospect

of such a reduction in immigration as would justify any relaxation of our

present immigration laws. A thorough organization of the labor market, to bring

the man and the job together with the least loss of time to each; a

constructive study of means for reducing labor-turnover; and training,

health-conservation, and steadied employment to increase the workers'

efficiency--these are the policies which will man our industries and at the

same time develop in the workers a stronger confidence in our civilization. <p>



<p>



<p>



The war's effect on our labor-supply would result in policies which will give

us a more efficient labor force with a higher standard of living. When

immigration resumes its normal flow, as it may do in a few years, our efficient

domestic labor force will enable us to absorb the new immigration without

creating the evils of the past. Instead of deploring the check to immigration

which will probably result from the war, we should interest ourselves in

stimulating labor policies that will raise the efficiency of our whole labor

population. This will give us a healthy labor policy in place of the suicidal

policies of the past. Nothing will promote America's industrial position among

the nations more surely; nothing will operate so effectively to check extreme

labor movements like Bolshevism.<p>

	<font size=5>T</font>he American political system is famous for reacting to national crises 
after they happen instead of anticipating them, but in the case of what 
became known in the sixties as the urban crisis, the problem was almost 
the opposite. The Watts riots, in the summer of 1965, made it obvious to 
everyone that the big-city black ghettos were in bad trouble, and 
instantly the ghettos became the leading domestic issue. Rather than being 
caught unprepared, the government already had at least part of the 
supposed solution in place--the War on Poverty, which President Lyndon 
Johnson had declared in January of 1964, when there was virtually no 
political pressure on the government to do anything about either ghettos 
or poverty. This meant that after Watts, Johnson did not have the luxury 
of basing a government response to the problems of the ghettos on the 
lessons of the riots. There were already too many givens. The programs of 
the Office of Economic Opportunity, the agency created to run the War on 
Poverty, were well under way, and the OEO quickly defined itself as the 
locus of riot prevention inside the government. The OEO was fully 
committed to a poverty-fighting strategy that had emerged while the 
ghettos were still seen as straitened but strong ethnic enclaves: 
community action, in which new, independent local organizations in poor 
neighborhoods would be given federal money to vanquish poverty.<P>
Another problem for the OEO was that an intense rivalry between Johnson 
and Robert Kennedy was essentially built into it. The War on Poverty was 
Johnson's first major initiative as President, and Johnson intended it to 
demonstrate that despite his reputation as a Texas conservative he was 
more liberal than John F. Kennedy. But the idea of fighting poverty had 
germinated during the Kennedy Administration, with Robert Kennedy playing 
a more important role than his brother. In the aftermath of Watts, Johnson 
was convinced that whatever he did about the ghettos (and Vietnam, where 
he had committed American combat troops just two weeks before the Watts 
riots broke out), he would have to contend with the opposition of Robert 
Kennedy, who was the most popular figure in Johnson's party.<P>
The antipathy between Johnson and Kennedy went back a long way. At the 
1960 Democratic Convention, after Johnson had accepted John Kennedy's 
offer of the vice-presidential nomination, Robert Kennedy humiliated 
Johnson by coming to his hotel room and asking him to change his mind. 
Each man made the other a symbol of his greatest disappointment: Kennedy 
saw in Johnson the end of Camelot; Johnson thought that Kennedy was the 
main architect of his rejection by the liberal establishment, which made 
it impossible for him to achieve the Rooseveltian status he wanted.<P>
In the summer of 1965 Harry McPherson, an aide to Johnson, wrote him a 
memo pleading with him to stop worrying about whether his Cabinet members 
were more loyal to the Kennedys or to him and to stop opposing good 
policies just because Kennedy was for them. It contains a fair rendering 
of Johnson's view of Kennedy:<P>
      "He is trying to put himself into a position of leadership among 
liberal Senators, newspapermen, foundation executives, and the like. Most 
of these people mistrusted him in the past, believing him (rightly) to be 
a man of narrow sensibilities and totalitarian instincts....as we know the 
intellectuals are as easy a lay as can be found. I can imagine them 
believing that, although Bobby is an absolutist with little sense of the 
subtle shadings of an argument, and little tolerance for those who cross 
him, they can still use him to get across radical ideas....The Kennedys 
are handsome and dashing, they support fashionable artists, and they can 
pay for almost anything. They support a great many good causes. And to 
some people even their rudeness and ruthlessness is exciting."<P>
Although the main area of substantive dispute between Johnson and Kennedy 
was Vietnam, there was also a deep-seated competition between them on 
race. During John Kennedy's presidency Johnson was the chairman of the 
President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, and Robert Kennedy 
was a member. Johnson removed the original executive director of the 
committee, a Kennedy appointee, and set up a program called Plans for 
Progress, which tried to get government contractors to hire more blacks 
voluntarily, nudged along by Johnson-style persuasion. Robert Kennedy, who 
was worried about how the administration's hiring record would look in the 
1964 campaign, favored a tougher system, and considered Johnson's vice 
chairman, a black man, to be an Uncle Tom. Kennedy and Johnson often 
quarreled in committee meetings, in a way that went beyond the bounds of 
usual behavior in government and made the other committee members 
intensely uncomfortable.<P>
When President Kennedy was about to propose the landmark bill that became 
the Civil Rights Act, Johnson thought it had no chance of passing, partly 
because Kennedy was reluctant to undertake a major speaking campaign in 
its behalf (one Kennedy Administration official has said that the most 
nervous he ever saw John Kennedy was at a meeting to discuss the Civil 
Rights Act). Johnson urged the Kennedy people not to propose the bill if 
Kennedy wasn't prepared to spend his own political capital on it. When 
Johnson passed the bill, in 1964, there was a feeling in the Kennedy camp 
that he was taking credit for a Kennedy idea that he had not supported the 
year before. Robert Kennedy, who even after the assassination referred to 
his brother as "the President" and to Johnson as "Johnson," sent one of 
his civil-rights assistants a pen in a frame with a photograph of the 
ceremony in which Johnson signed the bill (the photograph shows Robert 
Kennedy in the center of the front row of the audience, staring desolately 
into the middle distance); the inscription read, "Pen used to sign 
President Kennedy's civil rights bill."<P>
<BR><p>
The personal experiences that Johnson and Robert Kennedy had with race in 
the sixties were completely different. Kennedy began visiting the ghettos 
early in his brother's presidency and continued to do so for the rest of 
his life, but Johnson had relatively little contact with blacks. His 
favorite story about his own experience with the horrors of segregation 
had to do with the time his servants, Helen and Gene Williams, transported 
his dog by car from Washington to Texas and were unable to stay in motels 
or eat in restaurants. He felt uneasy with civil-rights leaders to the 
left of Roy Wilkins, of the NAACP, and Whitney Young, of the Urban League-
including Martin Luther King, Jr., whom Johnson considered to be vain, 
preachy, Communist-influenced, and, when King began to oppose the Vietnam 
War, a man who cared more about posturing than helping his own people. 
(Robert Kennedy didn't especially like King either.) Up close, Johnson had 
a hard time treating the many civil-rights landmarks of his administration 
with the dignity they deserved. He summoned Louis Martin, his closest 
black political adviser, to the White House for the announcement of the 
appointment of the first black Cabinet member by saying, "I was sitting in 
the toilet here and I got to thinking about you." Johnson never completely 
shed the racial language of his youth: he occasionally used the word 
"nigger" in private.<P>
Johnson's views on how to solve racial problems were those of a man whose 
whole world was politics. He began telling friends shortly after the 
Second World War that he believed that blacks, having fought and died to 
protect the world from a racist dictator, were not going to, as he put it 
once in 1948, "take the shit we're dishing out" much longer. The best 
peaceable route to equality for blacks, he thought, was "vote power." When 
he heard about the Supreme Court's decision in the 1954 Brown v. Board of 
Education case, he told a friend, "They should have done voting rights 
first and then education." He believed that politicians are largely 
prisoners of their constituencies and that black enfranchisement would 
quickly change the supposedly intransigent southerners in Congress. "If 
they give the blacks the vote, ol' Strom Thurmond will be kissing every 
black ass in South Carolina," he told a friend once. He knew this lesson 
from his own life. He never liked segregation, but for a long time he 
confined his passionate public outbursts against it to settings where he 
knew his career wasn't at stake.<P>
Just as it was instinctive for Johnson to think of racial problems in 
political terms, it was instinctive for Kennedy to believe that a 
deep-dyed politician like Johnson was incapable of truly confronting 
racial problems. Much more than most people in government, Kennedy saw 
life as a morality play, and he came increasingly to reject the New Deal 
and the flabby, talky, deal-making politicians who were its legatees in 
the Democratic Party "God, I hate that," he told his aide Peter Edelman 
after a long meeting with the California politician Jesse Unruh in 1968. 
"We used to send Larry O'Brien to do that....He could talk the balls off a 
brass monkey." A few weeks after the assassination Kennedy told Arthur 
Schlesinger, Jr., "My brother barely had a chance to get started--and 
there is so much now to be done--for the Negroes and the unemployed and 
the school kids and everyone else who is not getting a decent break in our 
society....The new fellow doesn't get this. He knows all about politics 
and nothing about human beings."<P>
In the spring of 1966, during the formulation of Johnson's Model Cities 
program, which was designed to spend billions on the rehabilitation of the 
ghettos, Kennedy arrived late at a small dinner attended by several 
administration officials and delivered a tirade against Model Cities. "He 
said, 'It's too little, it's nothing, we have to do twenty times as 
much,'" says one person who was there. Kennedy began to distance himself 
more and more publicly from the Johnson Administration. He served as the 
conduit for a "peace feeler" from the North Vietnamese, participated in 
hearings on hunger in Mississippi, helped orchestrate hearings on the 
urban crisis which were critical of the Johnson Administration, and 
proposed bills to create two million new public-service jobs and so 
channel government and private investment into rebuilding the housing 
stock and employment base in the ghettos. Johnson, a devoted believer in 
the Getting Things Done faith, had no respect for this kind of 
position-striking; he considered the real purpose of all Kennedy's actions 
to be the embarrassment of Lyndon Johnson. He opposed Kennedy's jobs bill, 
his ghetto-development bill, and an expansion of the food-stamps program 
which was proposed after the hunger hearings.<P>
It is commonly said that Vietnam drew Johnson's attention away from the 
War on Poverty and weakened his financial commitment to it. That may be, 
but if the war in Vietnam had suddenly ended, Johnson would still have 
disliked the War on Poverty for having turned out to be, to his mind, a 
stronghold of his enemies.<P>
His general attitude is indicated by a memo that Harry McPherson, 
mimicking Johnson, wrote to Joseph Califano, Johnson's chief 
domestic-policy adviser, as a comment on a letter from a small-town Ohio 
Jaycee complaining about the OEO: "If you and Sarge [Sargent Shriver, the 
head of the OEO] weren't in this thing and always working and humping for 
that program that never mentions anybody's name we wouldn't get into this 
kind of problem with these people here. Neither one of you ever ran for 
constable and you just can't sit still for wanting to talk about this 
program everybody says is just criminal and wrong."<P>
Johnson told Wilbur Cohen, a high official at the Department of Health, 
Education, and Welfare, that he considered virtually everyone at the OEO 
to be disloyal and a troublemaker. "They're not against poverty, they're 
for Kennedy," he told his adviser Bill Moyers. Toward the end of his term 
Johnson had a rueful conversation with Abe Fortas, then a Supreme Court 
justice, in which he recalled that an old New Deal friend of his and 
Fortas's, Elizabeth Wickenden, had been unable to gain the ear of anyone 
in the administration for her warnings about community action in late 1963 
and early 1964. "I should have listened to Wicky," Johnson said.<P>
In the final stages of his presidency the idea of large-scale government 
programs for the ghettos had become so bound up in his mind with liberal 
opposition to him that Johnson became positively hostile toward them. He 
was deeply suspicious of the Kerner Commission, which he had appointed 
after the terrible Newark and Detroit riots of 1967 to determine how 
future riots could be avoided. Johnson was convinced that there was a 
conspiracy behind the riots--in fact, Shriver had to reassure him that OEO 
employees were not instigating some of the riots. David Ginsburg, the 
Kerner Commission's executive director and an old friend of Johnson's, 
says that when Johnson called him in after his appointment, "he made it 
very clear that in his view it was simply not possible to have so many 
outbreaks at the same time without someone orchestrating it.<P>
The Kerner Commission recommended billions of dollars' worth of new 
government programs for the ghettos, which Johnson thought put him in an 
impossible position, by making whatever he did thereafter look like a 
sellout. Despite the entreaties of his staff, he refused to comment on the 
report, refused to allow the commission to present it to him, refused even 
to sign the form letters his staff drew up thanking the members for their 
work. "I just can't sign this group of letters," he told Harry McPherson. 
"I'd be a hypocrite. And I don't even want it let known that they got this 
far...otherwise somebody will leak that I wouldn't sign them. Just file 
them--or get rid of them."<P>
On April 10, 1968, in the aftermath of Martin Luther King's assassination, 
Joseph Califano sent Johnson a long memo suggesting that he react to the 
crisis by making an address to a joint session of Congress, adding 
billions to anti-poverty programs, and appointing well-known experts to 
look into a major re-ordering of the government's fiscal priorities. 
Johnson, who rarely wrote anything down, scrawled angry comments all over 
the memo. To Califano's reminder that he had promised to address a joint 
session of Congress, Johnson responded, "I promised nothing. I stated my 
intention only. Since changed by riots." To the suggestion that he ask the 
advice of "someone with a completely open mind," like McGeorge Bundy, the 
former national security adviser who was then the very visibly liberal 
head of the Ford Foundation, Johnson responded, "Ha! Ha!" At the end of 
the memo he wrote, "Forget it."<P>
<BR><P>
<b>HOW THE GHETTOS COULD BE HELPED</b><P>
In the founding days of the war on poverty, Sargent Shriver and his aides 
assumed that as time went on, their efforts would only become grander. 
There would be much bigger budgets. As new ideas about fighting poverty 
emerged, they could be tried out, and expanded if they worked. Instead, 
Shriver's group found that as the importance of the problem they were 
working on became clearer, their room to maneuver steadily decreased. 
Instead of spending the late sixties experimenting with new programs, they 
were forced to defend the programs already in place--in particular, 
community action.<P>
In 1964, when the enabling legislation for it was passed, community action 
was not a widely agreed-upon cure for poverty. It stood in relation to 
mainstream liberalism as supply-side economics would to conservatism in 
1981: it was an untested idea championed by a small group of thinkers who 
seized an opportunity to make it government policy. Just as supply-side 
tax cuts have never been clearly shown to do what they're supposed 
to--increase government revenues--community action never demonstrably 
reduced poverty in a neighborhood. Still, by the end of the sixties, if 
community action itself had not become a part of the political consensus 
about ghettos, its lineal descendant community development had. Community 
action was designed to let poor people substantially determine their own 
poverty-fighting strategies, which might be anything, including organizing 
opposition to the local power structure. Community development meant, more 
simply, turning the ghettos into healthy neighborhoods: rebuilding the 
housing stock, establishing an economic base by encouraging the location 
of factories and offices and the creation of new businesses there, and 
strengthening the web of local church, voluntary, and political 
organizations. This was a much more concrete and politically acceptable 
idea than community action, but there was still no proof that it would 
work. One of the reasons no other coherent political solution to the 
problems of the ghettos emerged in the late sixties is that in every other 
case the way was blocked.<P>
Besides community action and community development, three other broad 
paradigms for helping the ghettos were part of the public discourse in the 
late sixties. One was racially desegregating the northern cities; another 
was simply giving poor people money; another was giving them jobs.<P>
The idea of integration as a cure for the ghettos, with its implication 
that blacks would do well to assimilate into white culture, lost some of 
its appeal for liberals because of the rise of the black-power movement. 
But by far the most politically important opposition to integration came 
from whites who weren't liberal, especially whites in the North. Every 
elected official in a northern city knew that the residential line between 
black and white neighborhoods was the place of maximum political danger to 
him. Robert Kennedy said in 1964 that his brother had been late to issue a 
housing desegregation order that he had promised during his presidential 
campaign because northern Democratic congressmen were worried that it 
would hurt them in the 1962 elections. Over the Christmas holidays in 1962 
John Kennedy had mentioned to an aide that it would be a good idea to 
break up the black ghettos, but very difficult politically.<P>
In 1965, after the Johnson law that established federal aid for local 
school districts as a major government program went into effect, the 
commissioner of education threatened to withhold funds from the Chicago 
school system, largely on the grounds that it was segregated. Mayor Haley 
spoke with the President, and the commissioner of education was moved to a 
different job. In 1967 the next commissioner of education was stripped of 
his civil-rights-enforcement responsibilities after offending powerful 
congressmen on the integration issue. The Model Cities bill, proposed by 
Johnson in 1966, originally contained a provision requiring that local 
Model Cities projects promote residential integration; Senator John 
Sparkman, of Alabama, the chairman of the housing subcommittee, objected, 
and all mention of integration was dropped from the bill.<P>
We are now in a period of widespread concern that welfare, if not 
carefully limited, will reduce its recipients to a state of permanent 
dependency. But from roughly 1961 to 1975 liberal opinion overwhelmingly 
supported the idea of a "guaranteed, annual income"--that is, giving all, 
poor people enough money to lift them out of poverty. Shriver, who at the 
outset of the War on Poverty was promoting slogans like "A hand up, not a 
handout," had within a year become a convert to the idea of a guaranteed 
income, and he proposed it to Johnson.<P>
The problem was that Johnson hated welfare. "You tell Shriver no doles," 
he said to Bill Moyers early in 1964. On Johnson's instructions the 
economist Lester Thurow, then on the staff of the Council of Economic 
Advisers, was given the task of going through the annual Economic Report 
of the President and removing anything that could be construed as a 
reference to putting cash in the hands of poor people. One year the White 
House staff succeeded in slipping into the annual presidential budget 
message a promise to extend welfare benefits to families with unemployed 
fathers, which was supposed to be the way to make sure that welfare 
wouldn't break up families; Johnson refused to follow through, because he 
saw it as more welfare. (This change will finally take place in October, 
1990, as one of the provisions of the major welfare-reform law that 
Congress passed last fall.) In 1968 he appointed a presidential commission 
on income maintenance, but nothing ultimately came of its work. All 
through the Johnson Administration a welfare solution to poverty (except 
poverty among elderly people on Social Security) was not a serious option, 
because of Johnson himself. And in this one instance Robert Kennedy was 
never willing to embrace the liberal anti-Johnson position, because he, 
too, was against welfare, and resisted the entreaties of his staff and of 
Martin Luther King, among others, to endorse a guaranteed income.<P>
<BR>
<p>
There was no similar opposition at the top to the idea of creating jobs. 
Johnson had established a large publics works jobs program from scratch 
when he was the Texas director of the National Youth Administration, in 
the thirties, and his glowing memories of its success made him 
instinctively like the idea of jobs programs. Robert Kennedy, through the 
late sixties, was a strong advocate of a federal jobs program for the 
ghettos. Shriver's favorite anti-poverty program was the Job Corps, so 
named partly because his aides decided that job was the only word in the 
entire lexicography of government programs with no negative connotations. 
The government's failure to adopt a large-scale jobs program in the 
sixties seems especially painful today, because, unlike a guaranteed 
income, jobs programs are still widely proposed as the answer to the 
problems of the ghettos.<P>
One reason--probably the main reason--that a big jobs program never 
happened in the late sixties is the cost. Creating jobs is the most 
expensive kind of anti-poverty program, much more expensive per 
beneficiary than even a generous guaranteed income. In the early planning 
stages of the War on Poverty, when there was a ceiling of $500 million on 
its entire budget, Willard Wirtz, the Labor Secretary, was proposing $3 
billion to $4 billion a year just in Labor Department jobs programs. In 
February of 1964 Wirtz, with Shriver's blessing, made a plea at a Cabinet 
meeting for a new tax on cigarettes to finance his jobs program, and 
Johnson snubbed him, first turning his head in a sideways pout so as not 
to look at Wirtz, and then picking up his ever-present telephone and 
making a few calls in the middle of Wirtz's presentation. The people there 
took this to be Johnson's way of saying that he didn't want to raise taxes 
just then.<P>
Economists, who were very important in the planning of the War on Poverty 
(the original idea of an anti-poverty program had come from the White 
House Council of Economic Advisers), tended to be unenthusiastic about 
jobs programs, because they thought that bringing down the overall 
unemployment rate through fiscal and monetary policy would do more good. 
Organized labor, at the time the most powerful Democratic interest group 
by far, was always touchy about jobs programs, because they might weaken 
wages and compete with unions. (The Job Corps didn't ruffle labor's 
feathers, because it was engaged in job training in special camps far away 
from the labor market, and it didn't create jobs. Most of the success 
stories about it involve graduates of the camps who joined the military, 
rather than getting skilled jobs in their home towns.) Also, the two 
leading advocates of creating jobs, Wirtz and his assistant secretary for 
policy planning, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, were not skillful bureaucratic 
players. Their ideas were good, but Wirtz and Moynihan were not good at 
selling them.<P>
In the earliest days of the War on Poverty, Wirtz adopted a position that 
Shriver's group (to whom he had to sell his poverty-fighting ideas, 
because they were the ones writing the legislation) found extremely 
annoying: proposing unrealistically expensive programs and insisting that 
they be run by the Labor Department instead of the OEO. While HEW, the 
OEO's other established rival, cooperated with the poverty warriors, Wirtz 
refused to be a team player, and he took every tiny detail so seriously 
that dealing with him on anything came to be viewed as an onerous chore.<P>
Moynihan, for his part, was not much more beloved by Shriver's group than 
Wirtz was. He was given the task of drafting the presidential message that 
would accompany the Economic Opportunity Act, the initial piece of War on 
Poverty legislation; his draft came in late, was too long, and emphasized 
jobs to the near exclusion of community action, which was meant to be the 
centerpiece of the legislation. Shriver's task force scrapped it. Moynihan 
now remembers going to see Kermit Gordon, the budget director, to warn him 
about the political perils of the community-action program, which sent its 
funds into neighborhoods without necessarily going through the local mayor 
and congressman. He recalls, "I said, 'I know you've thought of community 
action as a way of coordinating services at the local level, but another 
view is, they could raise a lot of hell.' But I realized there was no 
point in going on, because it was clear that Kermit Gordon thought I was 
out of my mind."<P>
When Wirtz heard about the Job Corps, he wanted the Labor Department to 
run it. Since the Job Corps was so important to Shriver, the last thing he 
would have done is let Wirtz control it. To mollify Wirtz, Labor was given 
jurisdiction over the second-biggest employment program in the War on 
Poverty, the Neighborhood Youth Corps. But Wirtz remained bitter, and 
blamed Moynihan, his emissary to Shriver, for having let the Job Corps 
slip away. When Moynihan took time off to work in Robert Kennedy's Senate 
campaign in New York, Wirtz let Johnson know about it, which guaranteed 
Moynihan a permanent place in the President's bad graces.<P>
Wirtz and Moynihan continued to be the most ardent advocates of jobs 
programs within the administration, and anything they proposed drew almost 
automatic opposition from the White House. Wirtz's hammering finally 
induced Johnson to ask Kermit Gordon to price out a jobs program; Gordon's 
memo, written in early 1965, stands out today in the reams of White House 
memos on the ghettos as the one that most gives rise to the thought, Now 
this really would have helped. It recommended creating 600,000 new 
unskilled public-works jobs, expanding delivery of the mail (the Postal 
Service was then the major employer of blacks in the government), and 
increasing the OEO payroll by 100,000 on the theory that it could fight 
poverty better as an employer than through ministrations to the poor. But 
the memo is full of subtle bureaucratic cues that said to Johnson, Don't 
do this--it would be expensive and politically unpopular. Johnson didn't 
do it.<P>
The Labor Department was always looking for ways to dramatize the need for 
jobs programs, even during a time of a falling national unemployment rate. 
Moynihan, a great spotter of trends, had seen an item in The Washington 
Post in 1963 saying that the Selective Service was rejecting half of all 
potential draftees, because they couldn't pass the military entrance 
exams. He got the idea of conducting a national survey of the Selective 
Service rejectees, which would provide Wirtz with dramatic evidence that 
poor young men, and especially poor black young men, needed special 
training--by the Labor Department, of course. The study (named "One-Third 
of a Nation," to evoke FDR) did not produce action from Shriver's group, 
though; Labor needed more ammunition.<P>
<BR><p>
<b>THE INFAMOUS REPORT</b><P>
Toward the end of 1964 Moynihan noticed another significant little fact: 
although the black male unemployment rate was going down, the number of 
new welfare cases was going up. Also, the percentage of black babies born 
our of wedlock was rising. Moynihan, a man with a journalistic love of the 
scoop, was eager to get this information out quickly. He decided to begin 
work on a new report, "The Negro Family: The Case for National Action." 
From the Christmas holidays of 1964 to February of 1965 his staff worked 
on the report full time, meeting with Moynihan to discuss their progress 
at the end of every day and not even taking weekends off. Drawing on the 
work of the sociologist E. Franklin Frazier and the historians Stanley 
Elkins and Frank Tannenbaum, they assumed that American slavery had been 
so brutal that it had weakened the traditional husband-wife family 
structure among blacks, and that the welfare system and high unemployment 
in the ghettos had hurt the black family still more. Now the ghettos were, 
as the sociologist Kenneth Clark put it in Dark Ghetto, characterized by 
"pathology."<P>
Wirtz wanted Moynihan to end the report with policy recommendations, but 
Moynihan didn't. He said that he didn't want to give people who disagreed 
with the recommendations an excuse to ignore the problems; also, he was 
never as zealous as Wirtz in promoting the bureaucratic interests of the 
Labor Department. The report began to circulate inside the government. 
Johnson's Howard University commencement speech, written by Richard 
Goodwin and delivered that June, contained a passage about the black 
family that drew on the Moynihan report. At Howard, Johnson announced that 
a big White House conference would be held in the fall of 1965 to discuss 
the next step in civil rights, and plans were made for a panel on the 
black family.<P>
Although the report was supposed to be secret, copies began to leak out. A 
story in The New York Times in July of 1965, for example, described the 
report in great detail. Although Moynihan always insisted that he had 
written the report for a small, private audience of policy-makers, his 
colleagues suspected that he had caused a copy or two to pass into the 
hands of people outside government. Moynihan at heart was more a writer 
than a bureaucrat. Even now, he not only writes books but also (a still 
surer sign of a real literary temperament) can remember specific lines 
from bad reviews twenty years after they appeared. His achievements in 
government have been more intellectual than political. The classic 
Moynihan pattern, broken only when his welfare-reform bill passed last 
year, with much help from other senators, is to propose a wonderful and 
original initiative and then see it fail to be enacted. As an example of a 
type, he is more English than American, the gentleman scholar-politician 
whose writing is passionate and graceful but does not relish the spade 
work that both pure academics and pure government officials in this 
country usually have to do.<P>
The word "attention" has come up repeatedly over the years in Moynihan's 
explanations of why he wrote the black-family report--attention to the 
problem, of course, but Moynihan has never minded personal attention 
either. He had the classic writer's fear of being denied the credit for an 
original thought. In the summer of 1965 he had a special reason for 
wanting a higher profile--he was preparing to run for president of the New 
York city council in the fall.<P>
The report did not get attention from the one person in the best position 
to do something about the problem: Lyndon Johnson. He didn't read it. But 
it got a fantastic amount of attention in Moynihan's own intellectual 
world, almost all of it negative and much of it bitterly, wildly, 
unreasoningly hostile. The Moynihan report might be the single most 
refuted document in American history, a slim pamphlet to whose 
discrediting book after book has been devoted. There was a mood change 
among liberals, after the Watts riots, that coincided almost exactly with 
the publication of the Moynihan report and caught Moynihan by surprise. 
For a professor he was not averse to a little rough-and-tumble. He had 
grown up partly in the slums himself, and was raised by a single mother. 
He knew what the world was like. His best-known work at the time, the 
chapter on the Irish in Beyond the Melting Pot, was written with an air of 
jaunty confidence that the time had come to talk about ethnic-group 
characteristics (like his own group's drinking) in a frank way, and let 
the devil take the hindmost. Now he had come up against the black
power movement, which did not like it when a white man described black 
society as being somehow ruined, and also against the white left, which 
was becoming less sympathetic to the idea that the values of middle-class 
America--the values that had gotten us into Vietnam--were so noble that 
poor people ought to embrace them.<P>
The White House conference was postponed until the next year. Moynihan 
lost his race in New York. He withdrew to academia, and his mood became 
understandably bleak. In 1966 he wrote Harry McPherson, his closest friend 
on the White House staff, that his current status as a pariah was so 
obvious that "if my head were sticking on a pike at the South West Gate to 
the White House grounds the impression would hardly be greater." He became 
convinced that the left had become the greatest obstacle to the 
achievement of liberal goals. His report was after all a call for 
"national action" in the area of employment, and the reaction to it, 
inaccurately painting it as an attack on poor blacks and thus neutralizing 
it, was the prime example.<P>
In government the effect of the Moynihan report was to make black 
out-of-wedlock childbirth--and, more broadly, the "culture of poverty" in 
the ghettos, which had been a staple of liberal books of the early sixties 
(notably, Michael Harrington's The Other America)--a taboo subject. 
Johnson's attitude toward the report was, in Bill Moyers's words, "I don't 
know what was in there, but whatever it was, stay away from it." Moynihan 
wrote to McPherson, "Obviously one can no longer address oneself to the 
subject of the Negro family as such." He dropped his own plans to write a 
book on the subject. Not until 1975, when Eleanor Holmes Norton gave a 
keynote address at the Urban League on the black family, did a prominent 
black leader publicly address the issue. The whole idea that there was any 
kind of inherent weakness in black ghettos became disreputable, and the 
prohibition of discussions of the ghetto culture seemed to strengthen the 
idea that the ghettos could be turned around.<P>
<BR><p>
<b>TRYING TO HEAL THE GHETTOS FROM WITHIN</b><P>
The rejection of any other overall strategy for helping the ghettos had 
the effect of strengthening liberals' allegiance to the community-action 
program. Community action was unpopular in Congress, but defending it 
became a cause, partly because there was nothing else around to defend. 
Over time the claim made for community action became attenuated: the 
program was not so much reducing poverty as it was developing a new 
generation of black leaders. Indeed, many people have since gone from jobs 
with community-action agencies to elective office, although if there had 
never been a community-action program, demographics and the Voting Rights 
Act would still have practically guaranteed a great increase in the number 
of black elected officials.<P>
As the community-action creed gained adherents, there was a constant 
struggle, inside the OEO and in the liberal press, to push local 
community-action agencies to serve the "hard-core poor" rather than the 
"easy-to-reach poor"; to steer the funding straight to community groups, 
bypassing elected officials; and to support strategies of political 
confrontation instead of accommodation. It was in a way inevitable, given 
the roots of community action in the theory that juvenile delinquents turn 
to crime only because of a lack of legitimate opportunity, that the OEO 
would come to the idea of funding youth gangs. The OEO did so in 
Chicago.<P>
The Woodlawn Organization, in Chicago, founded by Saul Alinsky in a black 
neighborhood on the South Side, was by the mid-sixties a national model 
for liberals of how a community organization could turn a ghetto around 
(though by then the Woodlawn neighborhood was already suffering heavy 
population losses). Two gangs, the Blackstone Rangers and the East Side 
Disciples, were engaged in violent warfare over the turf of Woodlawn. 
Inside the community-action world, the feeling was that the gangs were 
really part of the legitimate leadership structure of the community and 
could be made into a positive force if provided with opportunity in the 
form of a federal grant. In 1967 the research and demonstration division 
of community action, which was more daring than the operations division, 
gave The Woodlawn Organization $927,000 to run a job-training program that 
would use the gang structures of the Rangers and the Disciples to teach 
teenagers the skills they needed to enter the labor force. The grant "will 
put the Blackstone Rangers and the East Side Disciples to work," Shriver 
wrote Joseph Califano exultantly. "The City Police will see that armed 
fighting stops between the Rangers and the Disciples, and that our money 
is not used 'to arm both sides'....Finally, the grant was concluded 
without any exhortation from the Citizens Crusade Against Poverty, Walter 
Reuther, RFK, Chuck Percy, Dick Boone, the Presbyterian ministers, Pat 
Moynihan, or other heavy thinkers."<P>
The grant was made in June. By December two of the gang members receiving 
funds had been arrested on murder charges. (The Blackstone Rangers went on 
to change their name to the El Rukns and to run into legal trouble for 
such activities as dealing cocaine and contracting with the Libyan 
government to carry out terrorist activities in the United States.) The 
Chicago press and the conservatives in Congress, having been handed an 
example of criminal-coddling by Washington liberals more perfect than they 
could have dared dream of, launched a flotilla of exposes, denunciations, 
and hearings. Johnson was furious, and the grant was canceled in 1968--but 
it is a testament to the power of the idea of community action that many 
of the people who were leaders of the OEO at the time are still proud of 
it.<P>
<BR>
Community action introduced into the discourse the idea that urban black 
poverty could be solved from within the ghettos. This idea became much 
more appealing politically when decoupled from the OEO's tendency to 
engage in confrontation with the power structure. The beauty of community 
development for a politician was that it allowed him to express concern 
about the ghettos without angering white neighborhoods. Community 
development did not imply busing, opposition to which by the mid-sixties 
was already strong in many neighborhoods. It did not imply scatter-site 
public housing. It did not imply shifts in the compositions of 
congressional and councilmanic districts (every established local 
politician likes a stable constituency). It was popular among blacks in 
the cities, because it connoted pride and community control and jobs. It 
had a strong crossover appeal to Republicans, even those from districts 
where integration wasn't an issue, because it put government power in 
local rather than federal hands and promoted small
business development.<P>
Although Johnson sponsored a large community-development program in Model 
Cities, the most important patron of community development in Washington 
was Robert Kennedy. Perhaps part of its appeal to him was that the Kennedy 
family's success was rooted in an ethnic urban ghetto. Community 
development would also have appealed to the side of Kennedy that was 
uncomfortable with the New Deal approach to government. The liberal 
positions that he took as a senator from New York were in a way 
misleading; he never really considered himself a liberal. He said in 1964 
that his father's famous remark about all businessmen being sons of 
bitches applied to liberals, too. Right up to the end his pantheon of 
heroes included General Douglas MacArthur, Herbert Hoover, General Maxwell 
Taylor, and C. Douglas Dillon--tough, unsentimental men who did things. 
Community development seemed lean and practical. The entities Kennedy 
proposed to promote it were always called "corporations." Politically, 
advocating community development was an element of Kennedy's famous 
ability to appeal both to blacks and to white ethnics. In a debate with 
Eugene McCarthy before the 1968 California primary, he accused the 
integrationist McCarthy of wanting "to take ten thousand black people and 
move them into Orange County."<P>
All during the ascendancy of the idea of community development the ghettos 
were going through a kind of community devolution, suffering heavy losses 
of population, housing stock, and institutional life. Model Cities, like 
community action, on the whole failed to turn the ghettos around, and like 
community action, it is praised today mostly for its success in leadership 
development. Robert Kennedy's large community-development program in 
Bedford-Stuyvesant, a black neighborhood in Brooklyn, is one of the few 
efforts that seem to have had any lasting effect. The neighborhood has 
stabilized, thanks in part to a tremendous influx of outside resources, 
but even in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Kennedy's dream of creating jobs inside 
the ghetto was hardly realized. Only one major employer, IBM, was induced 
to open a plant in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and IBM was unusual among 
corporations for having a Democratic board chairman and two senior 
executives who were former Kennedy aides.<P>
Black poverty decreased substantially during the sixties, even as the 
ghettos were deteriorating: 55 percent of blacks were poor in 1959, and 32 
percent in 1969. The strong economy helped accomplish this, and so did the 
many and varied domestic works of Lyndon Johnson other than the War on 
Poverty: the Civil Rights Act and education programs and affirmative 
action, among others. The Great Society's less obvious role as an employer 
of blacks was also crucial. The political scientists Michael K. Brown and 
Steven P. Erie estimated in 1981 that the Great Society created two 
million new government jobs, most of them nominally in state and local 
government but funded by new federal programs in education, health housing 
and other social-welfare areas. A disproportionate share of these jobs 
went to blacks-
Brown and Erie estimated that black employment in public social-welfare 
programs increased by 850,000 from 1960 to 1976, a period during which the 
black middle class tripled in size. In 1970 the government employed 57 
percent of black male college graduates and 72 percent of black female 
college graduates.<P>
The government social-welfare programs of the sixties--compensatory 
education Medicare and Medicaid, child nutrition, and so on, as well as 
the programs of the War on Poverty--gave jobs to hundreds of thousands of 
blacks (many of them the "easy-to-reach" poor the OEO was trying to avoid: 
that is, people with an education) who used their newfound modest 
prosperity to leave the ghettos. In effect, all the while that employment 
programs were losing out to community-development programs within the high 
councils of the government, employment was working as a solution to ghetto 
poverty and community development was not.<P>
<BR><p>
<b>THE MOST FREE-SPENDING ADMINISTRATION</b><P>
Richard Nixon attained the presidency having won probably the smallest 
percentage of black votes of any President in American history, as his new 
adviser on urban affairs, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, reminded him in March 
of 1969. Very occasionally Nixon entertained wistful hopes about 
discovering a contingent of blacks who would vote for him--"30% who are 
potentially on our side," he once scribbled in the margin of a memo--but 
on the whole he was far too much the realist to believe that he would ever 
have a black constituency. Race was hardly the uppermost of his concerns. 
In the fifties he had a mildly liberal reputation on civil rights. As Vice 
President he was an honorary member of the NAACP, served as chairman of 
the President's Committee on Government Contracts, which was intended to 
make sure that blacks got a share of the government's business, and got to 
know black leaders, including Martin Luther King, Jr. But when he ran for 
President in 1960, he backed away from civil rights (for example, when his 
running mate, Henry Cabot Lodge, said that Nixon would appoint a black 
Cabinet member, Nixon instantly denied it), and in the 1968 presidential 
election he wooed and won millions of traditionally Democratic white 
voters who were unhappy with Lyndon Johnson's ardor on racial issues. The 
biggest states that Nixon lost in 1960 and won in 1968 were all ones in 
which white backlash was a significant force: Illinois, New Jersey, 
Missouri, North Carolina. "There were subliminal racial messages in a lot 
of Nixon's campaigning," says John Ehrlichman, who was Nixon's chief 
domestic
policy adviser. "It was subtler than code words. It was, 'I am on your 
side. I am going to deal with it in a way you'll approve of.' I know he 
saw Johnson's embrace of blacks as an opportunity. He exploited it."<P>
Ehrlichman says that on two occasions Nixon told him that he considered 
blacks to be less intelligent than whites. "He thought, basically, blacks 
were genetically inferior," Ehrlichman says. "In his heart he was very 
skeptical about their ability to excel except in rare cases. He didn't 
feel this way about other groups. He'd say on civil-rights things, 'Well, 
we'll do this, but it isn't going to do any good. He did use the words 
'genetically inferior.' He thought they couldn't achieve on a level with 
whites."<P>
Given Nixon's feelings about race, and given that anything he did on civil 
rights was unlikely to get him votes in 1972, what is surprising about his 
first term in office is how much social-policy making meant to help blacks 
went on. HEW pushed forward with many school-desegregation cases in the 
South. Labor established the use of numerical goals in affirmative-action 
plans. Nixon signed into law (granted, he was under congressional pressure 
to do so) a program to create temporary jobs in the ghettos, a subsidized 
housing program, revenue sharing and block grants for cities, increases in 
welfare payments, a major expansion of the food
stamps program, and a new program under Social Security that made payments 
to disabled people, among others; and he proposed a guaranteed annual 
income. That unpleasant period in the past that Republicans like to talk 
about, when we threw money at our problems, was really the first Nixon 
Administration more than it was either of the Democratic administrations 
of the sixties.<P>
Presidencies are shaped by their times, far more than they shape their 
times. Nixon's first term took place in the ideological shadow of the 
sixties. The consensus, such as it was, in Congress, in federal agencies, 
and among judges and intellectuals was more liberal than it had ever been 
before and than it has been since. Among the people advising Nixon on 
domestic affairs, those we would now think of as conservative Republicans 
were distinctly in the minority. For most of the rest, the sense was that, 
as one former Nixon adviser, Richard Nathan, puts it, "we just didn't have 
a new conventional wisdom--we accepted the paradigm of the Great Society." 
There was a feeling in the Nixon White House, not least on the part of 
Nixon himself, that racial issues would call forth a particularly 
Republican strain of virtuousness that the nation had been deprived of 
during the sixties. The Democrats were the messy, passionate, 
ultra-political party and the exemplary Democrat was Lyndon Johnson, who 
always overheated the rhetoric, who cloaked calculation in talk of the 
public good, who raised expectations too high and worked the country into 
a frenzied state bordering on real instability. On January 20, 1969, 
Johnson's aides turned over to Nixon's a stack of blank executive orders 
declaring martial law--all you had to do was fill in the date and the name of the city. The 
Nixon Administration would cool off the country (It was a point of pride 
that major summer riots, which had occurred every year under Johnson, 
disappeared as a national problem after Nixon took office. There are many 
theories as to why, not all of them crediting Nixon.) On race, the 
administration would carry out the law even though there was not a single 
vote to be gained by doing so. Somehow this seemed purer than the racial 
concern of politicians like Johnson and Robert Kennedy, who expected the 
reward of black votes.<P>
"Disgraceful in past 100 years both parties have demagogued the race 
issue," read Ehrlichman's notes of what Nixon said to a group of his aides 
in a meeting in 1971. "Used the issue. Haven't tried to solve it." Nixon 
constantly emphasized to the people around him the importance of keeping a 
low profile while carrying out civil
rights policy. "Don't let the federal government be heroic," the notes 
continue. "Won't help blacks or the cause." In 1970 H. R. Haldeman, 
Nixon's chief of staff, wrote a memo summarizing Nixon's views on 
desegregation. It began, "All people concerned are to do only what the law 
requires and they are to do it quietly without bragging about it." The 
memo continued, "We have to do what's right, but we must separate that 
from politics and not be under the illusion that this is helping us 
politically."<P>
Nixon knew that by far the most perilous domestic issue for him was the 
integration of schools and neighborhoods in northern cities. He frequently 
reminded his aides that he was strongly opposed to busing in the North. 
Members of his administration who were seen as grandstanding for 
integration, such as Leon Panetta, the director of the Department of 
Health, Education, and Welfare's Office of Civil Rights, and James Allen, 
the commissioner of education, usually found themselves out of a job. In 
1970 Ehrlichman wrote Nixon about another problem official, George Romney, 
the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development: "Suburban Integration. 
This is a serious Romney problem which we will apparently have as long as 
he is there. There is no approved program as such, nor has the White House 
approved such a policy. But he keeps loudly talking about it in spite of 
our efforts to shut him up....And he is beginning some administrative 
maneuvers in that direction." Nixon wrote back, "Stop this one." After his 
re-election, in 1972, when he was reshuffling his Cabinet, he told James 
Lynn, Romney's successor at HUD, according to Ehrlichman's notes, "Black 
problem. Romney pandered."<P>
Occasionally Nixon wondered whether he was being unfair to the South by 
desegregating the schools there and not in the North. Patrick Buchanan, 
who was one of his speechwriters wrote him a memo on this theme in January 
of 1970. Buchanan's position was that desegregation should not occur in 
the South or the North. Nixon wrote in the margin, "Is de facto 
segregation OK in the North and not in the South?" and "Why should we 
continue to kick the South and hypocritically ignore the same problem in 
the North?" By March, though, when Buchanan was fighting with the rest of 
the White House staff over what position a presidential message on 
desegregation should take, Nixon had grown comfortable with continuing 
quietly to undo legal segregation in the South without taking on 
segregation in the North. "No good politics in PB's extreme view: 
segregation forever," Ehrlichman noted about what Nixon told him in March 
of 1970. "Right: Believe should carry out desegregation. Integration not 
wave of future. No massive program. Lean [toward the position that] 
integration hasn't worked."<P>
<BR><p>
<b>MOYNIHAN FIGHTS TO SHOW WHO'S REALLY LIBERAL</b><P>
Nixon did not share Lyndon Johnson's desire to be perceived as a great 
liberal President on domestic matters, but he did have in common with 
Johnson an inability to be indifferent to the scorn of liberals. From the 
memo traffic of his White House it is obvious that the left-liberal 
political culture that had sprung up since the mid-sixties and that 
reached its zenith during his administration was much on his mind. It was 
easy for him to conjure up a nightmarish picture of the legions of 
Nixon-haters: Ivy League professors, black-power advocates social-change
promoting foundation executives, peace-marching Georgetown hostesses, 
affluent student revolutionaries, and to-the-barricades journalists. While 
reading about Leonard Bernstein's fundraising party for the Black Panthers 
in 1971, he wrote a note to himself: "The complete decadence of the 
American upper class intellectual elite." There was a close connection 
between these people and racial issues: in domestic politics, race was the 
main issue they should use in order to heap abuse on Nixon.<P>
Several people in the White House shared Nixon's feelings about the 
left-liberals, but for intensity and eloquence nobody came close to 
Moynihan, who as a result of his battles with the OEO and the abuse he got 
for his report on the black family had come to the conclusion that the 
intellectual left was, as he wrote in 1967, "as rigid and destructive as 
any force in American life." Joining a Republican administration was for 
him partly a matter of simple ambition, but it was also a sign of his mood 
after four years of severe battering.<P>
Moynihan's view of the state of the nation during 1969 and 1970, when he 
was working in the White House, was a dire one, It was a dire time--the 
time of Kent State and Cambodia and My Lai--and it seemed particularly so 
from the vantage point of the academic-literary subculture that Moynihan 
lived in. He saw the basic social peace of the country as endangered by 
the left. In May of 1970 he reported to Nixon that the Students for a 
Democratic Society had threatened to burn down his house in Cambridge and 
that his family had gone into hiding ("Even so, I'm sticking here. I am 
choosing the interests of the administration over the interests of my 
children"). Later that year he told Nixon that his ten-year-old son was 
afraid that his father would be assassinated.<P>
Moynihan wrote Nixon just before his inauguration, "Your task, then, is 
clear: to restore the authority of American institutions. Not, certainly, 
under that name, but with a clear sense that what is at issue is the 
continued acceptance by the great mass of the people of the legitimacy and 
efficacy of the present arrangements of American society." As he put it 
more directly the following year, "To be blunt, the people who brought 
down Johnson want to bring down Nixon."<P>
Nixon valued Moynihan, especially early in his administration, not just 
because of the hurts and resentments they shared but also because Moynihan 
appealed to his intellectual side. "He's so stimulating," Nixon told 
Ehrlichman once. Moynihan could discern and articulate a grand overarching 
purpose in the administration's many activities, and could explain to 
Nixon the similarities between his situation and that of other 
distinguished statesmen he knew Nixon admired: Lincoln, Roosevelt, Wilson, 
Churchill. Whom else was there for Nixon to talk with about his admiration 
for Disraeli, or for War and Peace? Also, Moynihan was useful for the 
quality of his radar: in 1969 he told Nixon that feminism was going to 
become a major social force, and in 1970 he predicted that there would be 
a series of urban fiscal crises. (Like Babe Ruth, he had a lot of 
strikeouts as well as home runs: he also predicted that the student 
movement would have lasting political importance and that "mutiny in the 
armed forces" was a real possibility.) He was full of ideas for grand 
initiatives: a constitutional convention in 1976, a Nixon architectural 
policy, a new federal Department of Higher Education and Research. He had 
a grand strategy, too, and it reflected his perspective, which was that of 
a bit of a provincial in the intellectual world: Nixon's domestic program 
would be aimed partly at solving social problems but even more at defusing 
the left.<P>
Nixon thought that bringing intellectuals around to supporting the 
administration would be part of Moynihan's job, but Moynihan realized in 
1969 and 1970 that this was impossible. What he and Nixon could do, 
though, was build a record of liberal accomplishments and thus discredit 
the intellectuals' attacks on the administration by demonstrating that 
they were based not on any substantive objection to its policies but on 
pure malice.<P>
Moynihan's dislike of the left was, then, in no way a sign that he had 
become a conservative. Every policy he proposed to Nixon was a liberal 
one. Nixon greatly disliked the programs of the War on Poverty--Head 
Start, the Job Corps, community action--and also Model Cities, the other 
big Great Society program aimed specifically at the ghettos. "No increase 
in any poverty program until more evidence is in," he wrote Ehrlichman two 
months after taking office.<P>
At the time, Moynihan was probably the War on Poverty's most visible 
critic, having published in 1969 a book attacking community action called 
Maximum Feasible Misunderstanding. And yet, in the first few months of the 
Nixon Administration, Moynihan succeeded in persuading Nixon not to open 
an immediate attack on the poverty programs. Why give the left any 
ammunition? "Avoid, at whatever immediate costs,...an enormous controversy 
over the 'war on poverty,'" he wrote Nixon a month after the inauguration, 
and in a new introduction to Maximum Feasible Misunderstanding written in 
early 1970 he proudly reported that all suspicions that Nixon harbored ill 
will toward the poverty programs had been shown to be nonsense. Moynihan 
pushed for budget increases for Model Cities, and distanced himself from 
his old Harvard friend Edward Banfield, who was academia's leading skeptic 
about the program.<P>
<BR><p>
<b>PLAIN CASH</b><P>
To Moynihan's mind, leaving the poverty programs alone was more a matter 
of political strategy than of policy-making, but Moynihan also had an 
ambitious plan for the direction in which social-welfare policy should 
move: toward a guaranteed annual income. Although he was strongly 
identified with jobs programs in the early sixties, and in the eighties 
has been best known as an advocate of work requirements for welfare 
recipients, he has not, strictly speaking, been inconsistent. He has 
always wanted the United States to become more like a Western European 
social democracy, with full employment and family allowances, but it is 
true that he has emphasized different parts of his views at different 
times. All through the late sixties the idea that a guaranteed income was 
the best way to fight poverty was his leading public cause. He and its 
other supporters argued that if poverty was defined simply as a lack of 
money, then a guaranteed income, even though for political reasons it 
could not be generous enough to take all families above the official 
poverty line, would certainly alleviate want among the poor.<P>
Moynihan's idea had another great advantage: it would eliminate the 
middleman. Programs involving job training and education, and of course 
the community
action program, created a large class of social workers. In the early 
sixties the planners of the War on Poverty used to refer to social workers 
as "Ladies Bountiful"--patronizing middle-class whites. After five years 
of the Great Society, though, the world of government social workers had 
changed considerably, to become the economic base of the black middle 
class: it was probably the locus in government of the kind of 
left-liberals that Moynihan and Nixon considered a threat to the stability 
of the country. If the government simply gave poor people money--adopted 
an income strategy instead of a services strategy, as Moynihan put it to 
Nixon--this would end the period of legitimizing, empowering, and 
enriching social activists, community organizers, civil-rights leaders, 
and the like. The social workers could hardly complain, because even as 
the government was cutting them out of the action, it would be passing the 
most sweeping anti-poverty program in history. They would be neutralized 
as a moral and political force.<P>
To Nixon this was an attractive notion. He, too, disliked social workers. 
At the meeting where Moynihan proposed the Family Assistance Plan, when 
Moynihan said it would eliminate tens of thousands of social workers from 
the federal payroll, Nixon's eyes lit up. The idea that a vast hodgepodge 
of government social programs could be consolidated into one simple grant 
appealed to Nixon's practical, rationalizing side. He realized that 
spending had political uses that Republicans tended to be blind to. It was 
a lesson he had learned the hard way--"Ike should have spent more in '60," 
he told a group of aides a few months after taking office. At a time of 
instability, domestic government expenditures could have a calming effect 
("He spent to keep the lid on," says Leonard Garment, who was Nixon's 
adviser on civil rights) and could buy him a little room to maneuver in 
his area of real interest, foreign affairs. Another of Nixon's advisers, 
Arthur Burns, a conservative economist who later became the chairman of 
the Federal Reserve Board, mounted a ferocious attack within the 
administration on the Family Assistance Plan, but by the spring of Nixon's 
first year in office Moynihan had beaten it back. In April, Nixon wrote 
Ehrlichman, "In confidence I have decided to go ahead on this program."<P>
The Family Assistance Plan twice failed to pass in Congress, and since 
part of the opposition had been from the left, its failure only 
strengthened Moynihan's convictions. He wrote another book, The Politics 
of a Guaranteed Income, arguing, as he had about community action in 
Maximum Feasible Misunderstanding, that the left had become the main 
obstacle to the achievement of liberal goals in America. To his mind, the 
whole episode said more about the mood of the intellectuals than it did 
about the needs of the poor. In 1973, when he was the ambassador to India, 
Moynihan wrote Melvin Laird, who had taken over his portfolio at the White 
House, to urge a third try for the Family Assistance Plan.<P>
It would not pass, Moynihan wrote, simply because "A guaranteed income 
will never be enacted while President Nixon is in office." But the fight 
was still worth it, because the plan was not "addressed to the poor"; it 
was "addressed to the cultural strata"--that is, it was meant to vitiate 
the arguments of intellectuals who liked to portray the Nixon 
Administration as heedlessly right-wing. Just proposing the Family 
Assistance Plan would help solve "the problem of legitimacy"--the present 
danger to authority in America--by providing a powerful rebuttal to the 
arguments of the dissenters.<P>
By this time, though, Moynihan had lost Nixon. As a politician in office, 
Nixon could not afford to be as wholly consumed as Moynihan was with the 
thrust and parry of intellectual life. Anyway, the Family Assistance Plan 
was also unpopular with the right, especially the conservative Democrats 
and Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee, who considered it a plan 
to make welfare more generous and thus one that would encourage 
dependency. Moynihan believed that dependency was a problem, but he 
thought that there was no point in the Nixon Administration's addressing 
it, because the liberals would never allow it to be solved. A large 
welfare-dependent class will come to be accepted as the normal and 
manageable cost of doing urban business," he wrote Laird. "It is in ways a 
political subsidy, as irrational perhaps as those paid to owners of oil 
wells, wheat fields, or aerospace companies, but whoever said politics was 
rational? Not Melvin Laird!"<P>
By the end of the summer of 1970 Ehrlichman was, his notes record, being 
told by Nixon, "Just get something done....Let it appear we've fought and 
come half way....Avoid appearance of defeat." It was particularly 
unfortunate for the Family Assistance Plan's standing with Nixon that 
George McGovern proposed a guaranteed income during his presidential 
campaign. At one point, discussing the McGovern plan with Ehrlichman, 
Nixon called in his faithful manservant, Manolo Sanchez. If McGovern won 
and implemented his plan, Sanchez said, according to Ehrlichman's notes, 
"I quit--go on welfare."<P>
Although the Family Assistance Plan was never enacted, the record of the 
first Nixon Administration does look like a victory for the income 
strategy. Nixon acceded to congressional pressure to increase welfare, 
food stamps, Social Security, and disability pensions, and partly as a 
result government transfer payments to individuals rose much more during 
Nixon's presidency than they had during Johnson's, while growth in 
government social-welfare employment leveled off. In effect, the 
government began cutting off the route of escape from the ghettos that so 
many had used in the sixties: government jobs. Simply giving out money 
doesn't get people out. From the time Nixon took office, the black rate of 
exit from poverty slowed to a standstill.<P>
<BR>
Of all Nixon's domestic advisers, Moynihan had the clearest grasp of what 
was happening in black America. He saw that government jobs were expanding 
the black middle class at the same time that what we now call the 
underclass was being left behind in the ghettos. In March of 1969, in a 
long memo to Nixon, he stressed the need for "the integration into the 
larger society of what is now a sizable urban lower class which at the 
moment is experiencing more than its share of the bad habits and bad luck 
which through history have afflicted such groups and caused them to be 
seen as 'different' or undesirable by their more prudent and fortunate 
neighbors....The Negro lower class would appear to be unusually 
self-damaging, that is to say, more so than is normal for such groups."<P>
With the underclass as with other social problems, Moynihan had two 
concerns: the problem itself, and the way left-liberal intellectuals (in 
this case, mostly black intellectuals) exploited the problem and so, he 
felt, damaged the American social fabric. This prevented him from being 
able to see the growth of the black government-employee class as a wholly 
sanguine development. As he wrote Nixon,<P><blockquote>
     "The Negro poor having become more openly violent--especially in the 
form of the rioting of the mid 1960's--they have given the black middle 
class an incomparable weapon with which to threaten white America. This 
has been for many an altogether intoxicating experience. 'Do this or the 
cities will burn.' And of course they have been greatly encouraged in this 
course by white rhetoric of the Kerner Commission variety. But most 
important of all, the existence of a large marginal, if not dependent, 
black urban lower class has at last given the black middle class an 
opportunity to establish a secure and rewarding power base in American 
society--as the provider of social services to the black lower 
class....What building contracts and police graft were to the 19th-century 
urban Irish, the welfare department, Head Start programs, and Black 
Studies programs will be to the coming generation of Negroes. They are of 
course very wise in this respect. These are expanding areas of economic 
opportunity. By contrast, black business enterprise offers relatively 
little. In all this there will be the peculiar combination of weakness and 
strength that characterizes Negro Americans as a group at this 
time....There is no true Negro intellectual or academic class at this 
moment. (Thirty years ago there was: somehow it died out.) Negro books are 
poor stuff for the most part. Black studies are by and large made up of 
the worst kind of ethnic longings-for-a-glorious
past...."</blockquote><P>
Helping the black ghetto poor, like other liberal goals, appealed to 
Moynihan both as something intrinsically good and as a gesture directed at 
the left. It would, he wrote Nixon, deprive "the militant middle class" of 
the ability to make an ongoing "threat to the larger society, much as the 
desperate bank robber threatens to drop the vial of nitroglycerin." 
Choosing an income strategy as the means to help the ghettos would 
palliate poor blacks' material needs without encouraging their integration 
into the larger society. It was the best possible course in terms of 
defanging the "militant middle class," but not in terms of the health of 
black America. Moynihan chose to make the intellectual gesture rather than 
pursue the most effective policy.<P>
Perhaps to demonstrate the Nixon Administration's genuine concern about 
black poverty Moynihan arranged for a meeting in the White House, on May 
13, 1969, between representatives of the Poor People's Campaign (led by 
Martin Luther King's former second-in-command, Ralph Abernathy, and also 
including Andrew Young and Jesse Jackson) and Nixon and several 
high-ranking members of the administration. The meeting was a disaster.<P>
The group from the Poor People's Campaign arrived late. Abernathy opened 
the meeting by reading in its entirety a nine-page statement outlining a 
political program that would have struck everyone in the Nixon White House 
as wildly unrealistic. After Abernathy had finished, Nixon replied in a 
friendly but guarded and unspecific way, looked at his watch, and said 
that an urgent matter concerning the Vietnam War had come up and he would 
not be able to stay for the rest of the meeting. Abernathy asked him not 
to go yet and replied at length to what Nixon had said. After that Nixon 
did go, leaving behind Vice President Spiro Agnew and nearly half the 
Cabinet to be upbraided by several poor people Abernathy had brought with 
him. Then Agnew excused himself, but the meeting continued. After it had 
gone on for nearly three hours, Moynihan reported to the group that some 
poor people who had come to the White House with Abernathy and were 
waiting for him in another room were threatening to stage a demonstration. 
With that the meeting was adjourned. On leaving the White House, Abernathy 
told the television reporters outside that it had been "the most 
disappointing and the most fruitless of all the meetings we have had up to 
this time."<P>
All this was far outside the accepted boundaries of White House meetings, 
and it was a blot on Moynihan's record: it was his meeting, he had failed 
to control it, and he had also failed to rise to Nixon's defense. Nixon 
"referred to that meeting for FOUR YEARS as the worst experience of his 
presidency," John Ehrlichman says. "When I'd bring up a meeting with black 
leaders, he'd say, 'You want me to have another meeting like that Moynihan 
meeting.'"<P>
Moynihan lost his influence in the White House when he returned to Harvard 
at the end of 1970. In fact, it had largely ended before that, though 
Nixon continued to like him personally and kept communicating with him. 
Once Nixon had been re
elected, there was no longer any need to outfox his critics by keeping the 
old poverty programs that they had expected him to gut. "Model 
Cities--flush it," Ehrlichman's notes record Nixon saying a few days after 
the 1972 election. A couple of weeks later, during a series of meetings 
with Ehrlichman to plan his second administration, he elaborated on the 
theme. Ehrlichman's notes of Nixon's directives include: "OEO-
legal services [a program to provide the poor with lawyers, who sometimes 
sued local government on their behalf]. Sally Payton [a black lawyer on 
the White House staff]--tell her to screw it up"; "Take the heat on 
OEO--it's the right thing to do. Be prepared to take it head on"; and 
"Flush Model Cities and Great Society. It's failed. Do it, don't say 
it."<P>
Even more than Nixon realized, a moment had passed in American history. 
Race remained, and will remain, one of the obsessive themes of American 
life, but the period when it was the central domestic concern of the 
federal government was over. Partly because the Democratic Party had 
embraced civil rights with fervor, the presidential electorate had become 
essentially Republican. Even among liberals, race now had to share the 
agenda with other issues, like environmentalism and feminism. Watergate 
would quickly end Nixon's ability to make any domestic policy at all, and 
more important, the OPEC Oil embargo would erase the national feeling that 
there was enough economic breathing space to allow for the contemplation 
of expensive social reforms.<P>
<BR>
At the same time that Nixon was dismantling the War on Poverty (after a 
long struggle, the OEO officially went out of existence in 1974), Lyndon 
Johnson was preparing for a big symposium on civil rights at the new LBJ 
Library, in Austin. Johnson was well aware that it was time for him to 
settle up the accounts--his heart had become very bad, and even in public 
he was constantly popping nitroglycerin pills to ease his angina pains. 
The library itself was finished, a typically Johnsonian overblown marble 
block. The civil-rights symposium was planned in a spirit of comity 
indicating that Johnson's soul was far more nearly at peace than it had 
been in 1967 and 1968, when (according to a memo Moynihan wrote to Nixon 
in early 1969) he was capable of a gesture like personally cutting from 
the federal budget the funds for a memorial to Robert Kennedy at Arlington 
Cemetery. Johnson delivered a smoking speech. He said that of all his work 
as President, civil rights "holds the most of myself within it and holds 
for me the most intimate meanings," and that "the black problem remains 
what it has always been, the simple problem of being black in a white 
society."<P>
In January of 1973 Walter Heller, the economist who in 1963 had been the 
first person in the government to propose a government attack on poverty, 
had a speaking engagement at Johnson's alma mater, Southwest Texas State 
University and Johnson invited him to spend the night out at the LBJ 
Ranch. Heller, a self-controlled German, was amazed at how unwilling or unable Johnson was to 
change his way of life in deference to his health. Dinner was fried 
shrimp. The customary telephone was still at Johnson's side at the table, 
and was still ringing. A week later Johnson was dead.<P>
The main subject of Johnson's disquisition at dinner was how deeply he 
cared about civil rights--how strong his record was, how it was his real 
legacy. Like many of the people who had worked for Johnson, Heller, while 
fond of him, was accustomed to wondering whether he really meant what he 
said or was just trying, in effect, to win a vote for that one last bill, 
the Lyndon Johnson Historical Greatness Act of 1979. Johnson was incapable 
of being simple and direct. He was always exaggerated, florid, 
calculating, vulgar. At one point in the review of his achievements he 
explained to Heller why he had appointed the black economist Andrew 
Brimmer to the Federal Reserve Board. "First I put Bob Weaver in the 
Cabinet," Heller remembered that Johnson said, referring to the first 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. "But they said, 'No, he's 
smooth-faced. We want somebody with"--and here Johnson pressed the corners 
of his mouth together with his two index fingers-
"'FAT LIPS!' Well, nobody's got fatter lips than Andy."<P>
Heller was shocked by this anecdote, but he left the ranch convinced that 
Johnson had been speaking from the heart about race relations. It is a 
tribute to Johnson that even though he simply could not come across in 
private as the conventional version of a distinguished statesman, and even 
though everyone who knew him well knew that he was regularly capable of 
insincerity, nobody--not Heller, not the civil-rights leaders he fought 
with, not the Robert Kennedy aides who maneuvered against him--doubted in 
the end that he was passionate about race relations. This was the public 
issue he cared about most, and as the years pass, it has become clear that 
he was the only President of this century who has cared about the issue so 
much. He told Heller that night, "I've done more for blacks than any other 
President. That young hero I replaced may have done something. But I did 
more." And he was right.

	<font size=5>"S</font>tand in the center of the black belt--at Chicago's 47th St. and South 
Parkway. Around you swirls a continuous eddy of faces--black, brown, 
olive, yellow, and white. . . . In the nearby drugstore colored clerks are 
bustling about. (They are seldom seen in other neighborhoods.) In most of 
the other stores, too, there are colored salespeople, although a white 
proprietor or manager usually looms in the offing. In the offices around 
you, colored doctors, dentists, and lawyers go about their duties. And a 
brown-skinned policeman saunters along swinging his club and glaring 
sternly at the urchins who dodge in and out among the shoppers. . . . 
There is continuous and colorful movement here--shoppers streaming in and 
out of stores; insurance agents turning in their collections at a funeral 
parlor; club reporters rushing into a newspaper office with their social 
notes; irate tenants filing complaints with the Office of Price 
Administration; job-seekers moving in and out of the United States 
Employment Office."<P>
So begins a chapter called "Bronzeville" in Black Metropolis, by St. Clair 
Drake and Horace Cayton, a study of the Chicago ghetto published in 1945. 
It's impossible to stand at the same corner today without wondering what 
went wrong. There's hardly ever any bustle at Forty-seventh and King Drive 
(as South Parkway is now called), especially during the day. The shopping 
strip still exists, though as a shadow of what it obviously once was, and 
there are heavy metal grates on virtually every storefront that has not 
been abandoned. Many of the landmarks of the neighborhood--the Regal 
Theater, the Savoy Ballroom, the Hotel Grand, the legendary blues 
clubs--are boarded up or gone entirely. The Michigan Boulevard Garden 
Apartments, a large complex that Drake and Cayton called "a symbol of good 
living on a relatively high income level," is a housing project populated 
by people on welfare. Prostitutes cruise Forty-seventh Street in the late 
afternoon. In cold weather middle-aged men stand in knots around fires 
built in garbage cans. Drake and Cayton's idea of the corner as the heart 
of a "Little Harlem," where one might glimpse Lena Horne or Joe Louis--or 
white people--sitting in a restaurant, seems ludicrous. <P>
I recently spent some time in and around the black sections of Chicago: 
the South Side, roughly eight miles long and four wide, the single largest 
black neighborhood in America, of which Forty-seventh and South Parkway 
used to be the nerve center; and the West Side, a few miles away, a 
smaller and rougher area. It wasn't just at Forty-seventh and King Drive 
that the decline of the ghetto over two generations was striking. This is 
something that black people in Chicago talk about frequently, wondering 
why the working-poor neighborhoods where they grew up became terrible. 
Many others wonder the same thing, and they are weary of the standard 
explanations for the ghettos, which are intellectually neat but don't seem 
to fit the magnitude of what has gone wrong. It stands to reason that 
there is another answer to the terrible question of the ghettos. During my 
time in Chicago I became convinced that there is one.<P>
When Drake and Cayton were writing, virtually all black Americans lived in 
segregated areas, though not necessarily in the urban North. By the 
sixties, when race relations had become a central national concern, the 
northern ghettos had received a large influx of migrants from the South, 
and they were portrayed as overcrowded, desperately poor slums stunted by 
racism. Today, after years of efforts to end poverty and discrimination, 
the ghettos are worse, much worse, than they were in the sixties. A few 
blocks from Forty-seventh and King Drive is a housing project called the 
Robert Taylor Homes, a two-mile-long row of 28 sixteen-story buildings 
housing more than 20,000 people. The four-block stretch of the Robert 
Taylor Homes between Forty-seventh and Fifty-first Streets has the 
distinction of being the poorest neighborhood in the United States. In the 
forties the strip of land where the Robert Taylor Homes now stand was the 
poorest part of the traditional black belt in Chicago, but it had many 
fewer residents and was just the bad part of the neighborhood. Today the 
project dominates it physically and demographically.<P>
The City of Chicago has defined a "community area" on the South Side that 
contains both Forty-seventh and King Drive and the Robert Taylor Homes, 
and its statistics show not just how bad off the neighborhood is but how 
much worse off it has recently become. In 1970 thirty-seven percent of the 
population of the area was below the poverty line; in 1980 the figure was 
51 percent. In 1970 the unemployment rate was 9.5 percent; in 1980 it was 
24.2 percent. In 1970 forty percent of the residents of the neighborhood 
lived in families with a female head; in 1980 the number had grown to 72 
percent. In 1980 of the 54,000 residents 33,000 were on welfare. Experts 
agree that all of the numbers are even worse today.<P>
For a decade after the burst of attention paid to ghettos in the 1960s 
there was a feeling that blacks were steadily moving up in America. The 
distance between black and white incomes was continually narrowing. Black 
education levels were rising sharply. Middle-class blacks were becoming 
more and more visible on television and in public places. There was a long 
string of black "firsts," especially and most impressively in elective 
politics.<P>
In the past few years there has been a steady stream of news indicating 
that at the same time there was another side to the story: a way of life 
in the ghettos utterly different from that in the American mainstream. One 
statistic had a tremendous impact on the public perception of black 
progress: starting in the late seventies, the U.S. National Canter for 
Health Statistics began to report that more than half of black babies were 
born out of wedlock, up from 17 percent in 1950. Today the figure is 
thought to be 60 percent nationwide; in Chicago it is 75 percent. Urban 
school systems have become increasingly segregated, with a large gap in 
achievement levels between black and white schools. Black unemployment is 
nearly triple white unemployment. Black crime rates have soared--in 
Chicago, which is less than half black, about four times as many blacks as 
whites are arrested for violent crimes. The infant mortality rate, which 
is considered one of the basic indicators of how advanced a society is, is 
rising in the ghettos.<P>
Occasionally a shocking event provides the outside world with a snapshot 
of ghetto life: Edmund Perry, not a directionless punk but a freshly 
minted graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy, dies in a scuffle with a 
police officer in Harlem. On the South Side of Chicago, Benjy Wilson, a 
high school basketball star, is gunned down on the street in broad 
daylight by two members of a teenage gang, one of whom is the grandson of 
the great blues impresario Willie Dixon. Perry and Wilson, and Wilson's 
murderers, were all from absent-father families; Wilson had himself just 
fathered a child out of wedlock. This is what life is like for the elite 
of the ghetto, not just the dropouts and semi-professional petty 
criminals.<P>
The way that the two version of black life since the sixties fit together 
is through the idea of the bifurcation of black America, in which blacks 
are splitting into a middle class and an underclass that seems likely 
never to make it. The clearest line between the two groups is family 
structure. Black husband-wife families continue to close the gap with 
whites; their income is now 78 percent as high. But the income of black 
female-headed families, adjusted for inflation, has been dropping. The 
black female
headed family represents an ever larger share of the population of poor 
people in America: 7.3 percent in 1959 and 19.3 percent in 1984.<P>
Why, during a period of relative prosperity and of national commitment to 
black progress, has the bifurcation taken place? The question should be 
urgent for anyone who thinks it wrong that millions of people in the black 
underclass lead destroyed lives or who, because of the problems of the 
ghettos, has had to give up the idea of an open, democratic city life 
built around public education and safe streets.<P>
There are two answers prevalent right now, both of which explain the slide 
in the ghettos using the shifting of economic incentives.<P>
The conservative answer is that welfare and the whole Great Society 
edifice of compensatory programs for blacks do exactly the opposite of 
what they're supposed to: they make blacks worse off by encouraging them 
to become dependent on government checks and favors. Poor blacks have 
children out of wedlock and don't work, so that they can get money from 
liberal programs. This view is energetically codified in Charles Murray's 
1984 book Losing Ground, which presents a series of charts and graphs 
showing poor blacks becoming poorer--and crime rising, and efforts to find 
work declining, and educational achievement dropping--during precisely the 
time of the War on Poverty.<P>
The liberal answer is built around unemployment. At the time that the 
ghettos began getting worse, unemployment was very low, but blacks, by 
then heavily concentrated in the northern industrial cities, were 
dependent on the one part of the economy that was falling 
apart--inner-city unskilled heavy labor. In Chicago the harbinger of the 
change was the closing in the late fifties of the stockyards, which for 
half a century were the sine qua non of lower-class grunt work and a heavy 
employer of blacks. Chicago lost 200,000 jobs in the seventies; small 
shut-down redbrick factories that used to make products like boxes and 
ball bearings dot the city, especially the West Side. The lack of jobs, 
the argument continues, caused young men in the ghetto to adopt a 
drifting, inconstant life; to turn to crime; to engage in exaggeratedly 
macho behavior--acting tough, not studying, bullying women for money--as a 
way to get the sense of male strength that their fathers had derived from 
working and supporting families. As Murray believes that one simple step, 
ending all welfare programs, would heal the ghettos, the unemployment 
school believes that another simple step, jobs, would heal them. "When 
there's a demand for the participation of the black underclass in the 
labor force, most of the so-called problems people talk about will 
evaporate in a generation," says John McKnight. an urban-research 
professor at Northwestern University.<P>
Among poverty experts the debate is raging, and though it is quite 
abstruse (it is based almost entirely on analysis of government 
statistics), the stakes are large. The country seems to be gearing up for 
another run at the problems of the ghettos; President Reagan has 
commissioned a major study of welfare reform, which is a polite way of 
asking what we should do about the black underclass. A new generation of 
government solutions will probably follow--solutions that will be aimed at 
either dismantling the welfare state or expanding it, depending on who 
wins the debate, which in turn will depend on who can explain most 
convincingly why the ghettos have done so badly.<P>
 With the discussions of the issue so exclusively reliant on statistics, I 
thought that studying a ghetto at first hand would yield something new. 
Here, in brief, is what I found:<P>
The black underclass did not just spring into being over the past twenty 
years. Every aspect of the underclass culture in the ghettos is directly 
traceable to roots in the South--and not the South of slavery but the 
South of a generation ago. In fact, there seems to be a strong correlation 
between underclass status in the North and a family background in the 
nascent underclass of the sharecropper South.<P>
What happened to make the underclass grow so much in the seventies can 
best be understood by thinking less about welfare or unemployment than 
about demographics--specifically, two mass migrations of black 
Americans.<P>
The first was from the rural South to the urban North, and numbered in the 
millions during the forties, fifties, and sixties, before ending in the 
early 1970s. This migration brought the black class system to the North 
virtually intact, though the underclass became more pronounced in the 
cities. The second migration began in the late sixties--a migration out of 
the ghettos by members of the black working and middle classes, who had 
been freed from housing discrimination by the civil-rights movement. Until 
then the strong leaders and institutions of the ghettos had promoted an 
ethic of assimilation (if not into white society, at least into a black 
middle class) for the underclass, which worked up to a point. Suddenly 
most of the leaders and institutions (except criminal ones) left, and the 
preaching of assimilation by both blacks and whites stopped. What followed 
was a kind of free fall into what sociologists call social 
disorganization. The result of the exodus from the ghettos is dramatic, 
both in the statistics and on the streets--the ghettos have lost 
considerable population, and they look not just bad today but also empty. 
As the population of the ghettos has dropped, the indices of 
disorganization there (crime, illegitimate births) have risen. The 
underclass flourished when in the seventies it was completely disengaged 
from the rest of society--when there were no brakes on it.<P>
This argument is anthropological, not economic; it emphasizes the power 
over people's behavior that culture, as opposed to economic incentives, 
can have. Ascribing a society's conditions in part to the culture that 
prevails there seems benign when the society under discussion is England 
or California. But as a way of thinking about black ghettos it has become 
unpopular. Twenty years ago ghettos were often said to have a 
self-generating, destructive culture of poverty (the term has an 
impeccable source, the anthropologist Oscar Lewis). But then the left 
equated cultural discussions of the ghetto with accusing poor blacks of 
being in a bad situation that was of their own making; thus they would 
deserve no special help or sympathy from society. The left succeeded in 
limiting the terms of debate to purely economic ones, and today the right 
also discusses the ghetto in terms of economic "incentives to fail," 
provided by the welfare system. Both sides call apparently irrational 
behavior like bearing children out of wedlock and dropping out of school 
simply a rational response to conditions created by society.<P>
In the ghettos, though, it appears that the distinctive culture is now the 
greatest barrier to progress by the black underclass, rather than either 
unemployment or welfare. Today the bedrock of the economic arguments of 
both left and right is eroding: the value of welfare benefits is 
declining, and the northern industrial cities are not rapidly losing jobs 
anymore. Still the ghettos get worse, and the power of culture seems to be 
the reason why. The new immigrants of the eighties (Koreans, Vietnamese, 
West Indians) have in many cases settled in the ghettos, and so should 
have experienced all of the reverse incentives, but they have quickly 
become successful, because they maintain a separate culture. The negative 
power of the ghetto culture all but guarantees that any attempt to solve 
the problems of the underclass in the ghettos won't work--the culture is 
too strong by now. Any solution that does work, whatever it does about 
welfare and unemployment, will also have to get people physically away 
from the ghettos.<P>
<BR><p>
<font size=4> <b>II. The Old Neighborhood</b></font><P>
One day last spring Sharon Hicks-Bartlett, a woman in her early thirties 
who is a graduate student in sociology at the University of Chicago, took 
me to see the place where she had grown up. The trip was an encapsulation 
of what has happened in the ghettos since the sixties.<P>
We drove from the center of Chicago toward the West Side ghetto--out West 
Madison, the riot corridor of the mid-sixties, and then Ogden, a broad 
boulevard that angles off to the southwest. The neighborhood where 
Hicks-Bartlett grew up is called North Lawndale, and today in Chicago its 
name carries the same freight that "South Bronx" does nationally. The 
Chicago Tribune published a long series last year that vividly presented 
North Lawndale as the embodiment of a black underclass community. The 1980 
census showed North Lawndale to be 97 percent black and 20 percent 
unemployed, with 40 percent of its families living in poverty and 61 
percent headed by women. Hicks-Bartlett, who hadn't been there for fifteen 
years, was shocked by the way Ogden Avenue looked: Douglas Park, in her 
memory a sylvan playground, was empty, denuded of shrubbery, with stern 
curfew signs posted; Lawndale Oldsmobile, once the biggest commercial 
establishment in the neighborhood, was shut down and abandoned; of the 
three neighborhood movie theaters a few blocks away, two were torn down 
and one had become a church. Everything that remained, even the churches, 
was protected by heavy steel mesh, and odd symbols (a six-pointed star, 
crossed pitchforks) were spray-painted everywhere.<P>
North Lawndale is a perfect example of the three-step process that has 
made the ghettos so bad today: the migration north, which included the 
underclass; then the migration from the ghettos of everyone but the 
underclass; and finally the victory of disorganization. In 1950, when it 
was a white neighborhood, North Lawndale had 100,000 residents. In 1960, 
when it had become all black and the first migration was at its peak, it 
had 125,000. In 1980 the population was down to 62,000; more than half its 
population moved away in the seventies. The Hicks family was almost 
completely gone. Sharon Hicks-Bartlett now lives in Park Forest, the 
integrated suburb south of Chicago described in The Organisation Man. As 
the population has gone down in North Lawndale, the indices of ghetto 
culture--poverty, crime, low educational achievement, low work effort, the 
percentage of female-headed families--have all increased in almost perfect 
reverse correlation.<P>
In real life the bifurcation is never as neat as in the numbers. As we 
drove, Hicks
Bartlett told me about her own family. Her parents had lived for two years 
in the now infamous Cabrini-Green housing project (a black island near the 
affluent white near North Side) before moving to North Lawndale. Her 
brother Walter had once played neighborhood basketball with Mark Aguirre, 
the Dallas Mavericks star, but had dropped the sport and his dreams of 
success. A year before, he had been badly and arbitrarily beaten by a gang 
that set upon him while he was stopped at a red light. Another relative 
had married a man freshly arrived in Chicago from the southern underclass, 
and she ended up on welfare for years. This relative, along with her six 
children and eight grandchildren (all born out of wedlock), had recently 
moved out of Cabrini-Green to the South Side, and had become estranged 
from the rest of the family. She and her family had not come to Sharon's 
wedding. It had gotten back to Hicks-Bardett that her South Side relatives 
were making cracks about its being no surprise that she was marrying a 
white man, because she had been living for years as if she wanted to he 
white--studying hard, moving to the suburbs. For her part, Hicks-Bartlett 
had decided since becoming a mother not to visit her relatives on the 
South Side anymore, because children there were regularly called, as she 
primly put it, "M. F. " It was an environment she didn't want her daughter 
exposed to.<P>
We turned onto the street where Hicks-Bartlett had lived, South Drake, and 
pulled up to the house, number 1643. A small gasp from Hicks-Bartlett: 
only about two thirds of the block appeared to be occupied. The rest of 
the houses were either abandoned or demolished. Sixteen forty-three was a 
classic Chicago two-flat; 1642, across the street, a three-flat, was 
one-third empty; 1625, 1649, 1652, and 1655 were missing entirely. The 
little parch of lawn in front of Hicks-Bartlett's old house had gone bare, 
and the paint had faded. "That house used to shine," she said. Down on the 
corner the grocery store was barred as if against an armored division. The 
cross street, Sixteenth, had become the hustling, dealing, and hanging-out 
part of the neighborhood, with the action centering on a windowless "game 
room," which was several months later exposed by the Tribune as a drug 
exchange and then closed down by the city.<P>
Hicks-Bartlett's grandparents bought 1643 South Drake in 1950, for 
$13,600. They were the third black family on their side of the block. The 
whites who sold them the house stayed on in the other flat as tenants for 
a year. When Sharon's family took over one of the flats, in 1962, the 
neighborhood was all black and still respectable-
postmen and janitors and their families lived there. Then, as it became 
more and more crowded with migrants, some kind of critical mass of 
teenagers was achieved (in 1950 twenty percent of North Lawndale's 
population was between five and nineteen, and in 1970 forty percent), and 
the gangs began to take over. One day in the early sixties Hicks-Bartlett's uncle Marvin was standing in front of the house wearing 
some new clothes that, unbeknownst to him, were the colors of rivals of 
the gang that ran the neighborhood. A group of young men walked up to him 
in broad daylight and pulled a knife. His mother, watching from the porch, 
screamed, and they ran off, having inflicted only a flesh wound. Soon 
afterward Hicks Bartlett's parents moved to an all-middle-class neighborhood on the far 
South Side, and over the next few years, as racial barriers fell in the 
housing and job markets, and the West Side began to have terrifying 
summertime rioting, most of their friends and neighbors left too.<P>
Today Hicks-Bartlett's grandmother, Bertha Williams, who used to own the 
house at 1643 South Drake with her husband, lives in Niles, Michigan, a 
small, pretty town between Chicago and Detroit. Her house is out in the 
country a little ways, on a lane off the highway. On the day that I went 
to see her she was sitting in an easy chair in her living room, which was 
decorated with portraits of her grandchildren dressed in either cap and 
gown or military uniform. There was a clock with pictures of Martin Luther 
King, Jr., John F. Kennedy, and Robert Kennedy on its face.<BR>
<p>
Mrs. Williams told me that all four of her grandparents had been slaves on 
plantations in southern Louisiana and had walked to New Orleans after 
Emancipation. She was born in New Orleans in 1914, and her family moved to 
Chicago in 1922, during the first great migration of blacks from the South 
to the North. In those days there was no government poverty line. The 
family lived in much greater material want than there is in the ghetto 
today--it was fourteen years before they were able to afford an apartment 
with central heating. She married Thomas Williams, a laborer from the 
South with no formal education. The couple had nine children and was 
occasionally on relief. But for Mrs. Williams there was no hint of the 
despair that these experiences are supposed to engender; her values 
remained staunchly anchored in work, marriage, and economic progress. The 
story ended, as many immigrant sagas do, with her and her husband both 
getting safe, low-level jobs on government payrolls and staying in them 
for decades, until retirement.<P>
As we were talking, a sixteen-year-old relative of Mrs. Williams's came 
home from school. After Mrs. Williams had finished recounting her life, he 
told me about his, and the sense of how much the culture of the ghetto had 
changed was dramatic. (This young man doesn't want his real name used, 
because he fears reprisals from Chicago gangs. I'll call him John.)<P>
John had recently moved to Niles from Chicago, because his work in school 
was suffering under the pressure of the gangs. He had been living in 
Jeffrey Manor, a borderline middle-class area on the far South Side. 
Although he was born into an economic position that it had taken Mrs. 
Williams thirty years in Chicago to achieve, he had had the disadvantage 
of not having a father, because his parents had split up before he was 
born.<P>
During John's first year at Chicago Vocational High School--a vast 
institution that has historically had a burly, can-do reputation (Dick 
Butkus, the middle linebacker, went there)--members of the biggest gang in 
Chicago, the Disciples, befriended him and urged him to join, saying that 
gang life was a lot of fun. At their request he gave them the key to his 
locker, but he didn't join, and the urging began to turn nasty. Gang 
members would chase him on the way home from school and beat him in such a 
way that the injuries would not be noticeable. (Sports stars and some 
outstanding students are usually immune from this treatment.) Although the 
Disciples controlled Jeffrey Manor, a rival gang called the Black Cobra 
Stones had established a beachhead there and began recruiting John too.<P>
During his sophomore year John joined a gang called the Valley Rocks, 
affiliated with the El Rukns, and began staying out of school a lot, in 
part because of the heavy demands of gang membership. He sketched out the 
big picture of Chicago gang life for me. There are two large families of 
gangs in Chicago: the People, whose symbol is a five-pointed star, and the 
Folks, whose symbol is a six-pointed star. These were what I had seen 
spray-painted all over North Lawndale. The head of the People, he said, is 
a man named Jeff Fort, and the head of the Folks is a man named Larry 
Hoover--both in their thirties, having emerged as leaders during the 
period when the adult leadership was rapidly leaving the ghetto, both now 
in prison. The gangs under the People include the Vice Lords, the Black 
Cobra Stones, and the El Rukns, as well as the Valley Rocks; under the 
Folks are the Disciples, the Spanish Cobras, and the Latin Jivers. The 
People control most of the West Side (John said it was the Vice Lords who 
had attacked his uncle Marvin twenty years earlier), while the Folks 
control most of the South Side. The People wear the bills of their caps 
pointed left, and cross their arms with the right arm on top, while the 
Folks point their caps to the right and cross their arms with the left on 
top. Every now and then in Chicago a teenager will be gunned down on the 
street for the crime of having his arms crossed right-on-top in an area 
that is Folks turf.<P>
John began as a foot soldier, an entry-level position in which the main 
duties are stealing, selling marijuana, and fighting with other gangs. He 
said that he did not rob people or sell drugs, but that "as far as 
fighting, I used to get into it a lot."  In the hierarchy, one is promoted 
from foot soldier to lieutenant or gunslinger, then to captain, then to 
chief. A chief commands about fifty foot soldiers. John's best friend, 
Rocky (not his real name), was a chief in Jeffrey Manor. Another friend, 
named Cortez, was a Valley Rocks chief at Chicago Vocational; recently the 
school administration had negotiated a Camp David-style peace treaty 
between him and the chief of a rival gang. Both Rocky and Cortez were two 
or three layers of bureaucracy removed from Hoover, the chief of the 
parent gang.<P>
One day, John said, he and Rocky were on a city bus and six or seven 
Disciples got on and attacked him, because of a quarrel over a girl. 
Rocky, who takes care to dress neatly, opened his briefcase, took out a 
gun, and started shooting. "They left," John said. "In fact, so did the 
driver and everybody else on the bus."  Another time, when he was standing 
outside a little store called the Candy Shop, right across the street from 
Chicago Vocational, a Disciple shot at him. He ducked into an alley and 
got away. Finally, when a friend of John's named Tystick was shot in the 
chest and back, he decided he had to get away. (In the time since we 
talked, both Tystick and Cortez have been killed.) Even Rocky, he said, 
was talking about joining the Marines as a way out--"'Cause once you get 
in a gang, you can't get out. They want you to do something really 
horrendous before you get out, like kill somebody."  The gangs are the 
real authorities, the most powerful force, in the worst parts of the 
Chicago ghetto, and as such they are another example of what happened to 
the ghettos when they became exclusively lower-class in the late sixties 
and early seventies. But John's story illustrates another point, too. The 
underclass culture, after a decade on its own to gather force, was strong 
enough to begin expanding its sphere of influence outside the bad ghettos 
to neighborhoods a step or two up the ladder, like Jeffrey Manor. There 
are several signs of the expansion of the culture, including rising 
illegitimacy and crime rates, but the gang recruitment is the most 
obvious; it forces kids, through physical terror, to give up school and 
work, and become professional criminals.<P>
<BR><p>
<font size=4><b>III. Back Home</font></b><P>
One of the largest international migrations in American history created 
the urban black ghettos. Almost all black southerners who came north 
arrived essentially penniless, and almost all settled initially in 
all-black, all-poor areas. Most of the migrants made it. The prevailing 
theories about why a substantial minority spectacularly did not make it 
cannot account for the relative success of most blacks who moved north. 
Answering the question of how and why some of the migrants got out of the 
ghettos and some did not, I thought, might be one of the keys to the 
mystery of the underclass. So I got to know a group of friends in Chicago 
who had come from one town in Mississippi--Canton, population 12,000, 
fifteen miles north of Jackson. Most of the group had graduated from the 
town's segregated black high school in 1955 (though some hadn't finished) 
and had moved north shortly thereafter. Their version of the origins of 
the underclass was new to me. <P>
Between 1910 and 1920 the first wave of 572,000 blacks moved from the 
South to the North, almost always to cities. In the twenties 913,000 left; 
in the thirties 473,000; in the forties 1.7 million, 18 percent of the 
black population of the South; in the fifties 1.5 million; in the sixties 
1.4 million. The number of blacks who moved north, about 6.5 million, is 
greater than the number of Italians or Irish or Jews or Poles who moved to 
this country during their great migrations.<P>
Chicago had 44,000 blacks in 1910. The labor shortages created by the 
First World War and the immigration restrictions of the twenties, along 
with the depression in southern agriculture due to the boll weevil, 
brought the first big wave. There were 109,000 blacks in Chicago in 1920 
(of whom 50,000 had come just in eighteen months during the world war) and 
234,000 in 1930. Big Chicago employers, like the packinghouses, sent 
agents to the South to recruit black laborers; agents of the southern 
farmers came north to try, unsuccessfully, to persuade them to come home. 
(A headline from the Memphis Commercial Appeal read "SOUTH IS BETTER FOR 
NEGRO, SAY MISSISSIPPIANS/COLORED PEOPLE FOUND PROSPEROUS AND HAPPY.") 
Chicago's preeminent black newspaper, the Defender, was widely circulated 
in the South and was a constant cheerleader for migration (which it called 
"The Flight Out of Egypt"), assuring blacks that Chicago had better jobs 
and more rights, even if it was colder. As one article put it, in response 
to a warning made to blacks by southern whites, "To die from the bite of 
frost is far more glorious than at the hands of a mob."<P>
During the Depression, because the word went out that jobs were hard to 
come by in Chicago, the migration slowed considerably; the black 
population grew by just 44,000 in the thirties. But the Second World War 
created a labor boom that set off a quarter century of sustained movement 
of southern blacks to Chicago. There were 492,000 black Chicagoans in 1950 
(a 77 percent increase in one decade), 813,000 in 1960 (a further 65 
percent increase), and 1.1 million in 1970. Because the migrants followed 
the existing train, bus, and highway routes, black Chicago was populated 
from the states along Highway 51 and the Illinois Central 
tracks--Arkansas, Louisiana, and, most important, Mississippi. In the 
fifties alone Mississippi lost more than a quarter of its black 
population. It's no wonder that the Delta blues became the Chicago blues 
in the late forties and early fifties; blacks still sometimes call the 
South Side "North Mississippi."<P>
Although the migration ended in the early seventies--again, because jobs 
had become scarce in Chicago--there is still considerable movement back 
and forth, and the South is very much in the minds of black Chicagoans. 
Most of the very successful local blacks who are held up as role models 
are southern-born: Jesse Jackson (South Carolina), John H. Johnson, the 
owner of Ebony (Arkansas), Oprah Winfrey, the TV host who appeared in The 
Color Purple (Mississippi), Walter Payton, of the Chicago Bears 
(Mississippi), the Reverend Johnnie Colemon, the pastor of the biggest 
church in Chicago (Mississippi). It is a custom among many black 
Chicagoans to go to the South at least twice a year, at Christmas and in 
July--over the Fourth of July weekend the hotels in Jackson are booked solid 
with black family and high school reunions.<P>
Black Mississippians go to Chicago too. Recently, at a student assembly of 
a black Catholic grade school in Canton, I asked the children how many had 
been to Chicago, and nearly every hand went up. Often they went for long 
visits with relatives in the summers. (How many want to live in Chicago 
when they grow up? I asked. No hands. Why not? An immediate chorus: "Too 
dangerous.") At one of Chicago's worst high schools--Orr, on the West 
Side--I asked a class how many were born in Chicago. Almost everyone was. 
But almost everyone's mother had been born in Mississippi. Many of the 
mothers of a class of eighth graders at Beethoven School, an elementary 
school whose students all live in the Robert Taylor Homes, were from 
Mississippi.<P>
Today there are 1.2 million black Chicagoans (the increase of 100,000 
since 1970 is the result not of migration but of births exceeding deaths). 
A reasonable estimate of the number who are in the underclass would be 
somewhere between 200,000, roughly the total population of all the 
low-income housing projects, including men who aren't official residents, 
and 420,000, the number of black Chicagoans on welfare. Even the highest 
estimate is only a third of the current black population, which does not 
include the approximately 230,000 blacks in Chicago suburbs.<P>
The experience in Chicago of the majority of blacks who migrated, then, 
has not been one of defeat and failure. A much more typical story would be 
like that of Mildred Nichols, one of the group I met from Canton. I met 
Nichols at a restaurant called Soul Queen, on the far South Side, near a 
neighborhood called Pill Hill (black doctors live there). We talked in the 
bar, where the waitress who served our drinks was wearing a gold paper 
crown.<P>
Nichols graduated from Cameron Street High School, in Canton, on May 28, 
1955, and arrived in Chicago on June 5. She moved in with an aunt and 
uncle she had never met and began looking for a job. She took a test to be 
an order-filler at the big Montgomery Ward catalogue store but was told 
that she had failed. She was convinced that she had really passed and was 
being tricked, so she told the woman who had administered the test that 
she would be back in the afternoon to retake it, and back again every day 
until she passed. She got the job, stayed there until after the Christmas 
rush, and then began working as a waitress on the midnight-to-8 A.M. shift 
at a restaurant in the heart of the ghetto.<P>
The themes that Mildred Nichols emphasized to me during our conversation 
were pride and success. Today she works in the office at a nursing home 
called Bethune Plaza, also in the heart of the ghetto. She has been with 
the same company for ten years. Of her five siblings, all younger, a 
sister has a master's degree and teaches school, one brother is an 
attorney in Jackson, married to a nurse, the next brother is a businessman 
in Canton, the next is a graduate of Northwestern Law School, and the 
youngest sister is a pharmacist.<P>
I asked her what their secret was. She said, "It might have been that we 
had a two-parent family. My father had a fourth-grade education, and my mother had 
eighth grade--we were middle-class. We lived in town. My father taught us 
that you have to be a strong person to survive. Willpower! Nothing, nobody 
is better than you. Nobody. Welfare? No! Jesus! No! Because I simply could 
not be bought. Never! Never! Catholic schools for my kids. No truancy. I 
told them, 'Give me two years of college. You must!' My son has no police 
record. My daughter didn't have her first child till she was twenty-five. 
I never did domestic work, darling. Never! I've always had office jobs. 
"<BR>
What about the people who had failed in Chicago? What was the difference? 
"They had low self-esteem. They didn't have the drive you need in Chicago. 
You see, this city is Jaws--One, Two, Three, and Four. They didn't want 
to!"<P>
In Mildred Nichols's view, the people on welfare were primarily children 
of sharecroppers from what southern blacks call "the rural"--the farming 
areas outside of town. "The persons who aren't able to deal with this 
society," she said, "are the ones from the deep-rural part of the South 
that had to drop out of school to pick cotton. They had no one to teach 
them. They still live that life-style of the rural South up here. The 
other day I went in the grocery store across the street from Robert Taylor 
Homes, and I went completely ape. I went stone bats! They had those Little 
Debbie gingerbread cookies in two-packs. They had the little packets of 
Argo starch--people in the country like to chew it, especially pregnant 
women, and in the country they stay pregnant."<P>
What was striking about this answer was how foreign Nichols found the 
commonly held idea that a poor black underclass has emerged over the past 
twenty years, starting with the flowering of the Great Society programs. 
The main characteristics of the underclass--poverty crime, poor education, 
dependency, and teenage out-of-wedlock childbearing--were nothing new to her. She and her friends, and 
white people in Canton, too, had seen them all their lives.<P>
Canton was established in 1834, as the trading center and seat of 
government for Madison County, Mississippi. It seems warranted to say that 
slavery was the town's central and defining institution. From the 
beginning blacks outnumbered whites by three to one (the ratio did not 
drop significantly until after the Second World War), and the whites' 
economic status and comfort and safety depended on keeping the blacks 
subjugated.<P>
To what degree slavery hurt the black family is the subject of a lengthy 
and complicated debate among historians. In Madison County what evidence 
there is supports the view that slavery had a destructive effect on family 
coherence. A small oral-history project carried out in the 1930s includes 
reminiscences by two former slaves, both of whom, when they were children, 
saw their parents separated through sale. One of them said that there were 
no marriage ceremonies for slaves in Madison County, and that pairings 
were often arranged by the masters.<P>
Through the mid-twentieth century Madison County was settled into a system 
of segregation and sharecropping. I found no real disagreement between 
blacks and whites about the particulars: All but a handful of blacks, 
fewer than a hundred, were denied the right to vote, by means of a poll 
tax and a "literacy test," in which the registrar of voters would pick at 
random a section of the Mississippi constitution and ask black would-be 
voters to read it aloud and then deliver an interpretation. There were 
separate black and white schools in Canton, and in the countryside blacks 
went to one-room schoolhouses with no new books, heat, electricity, or 
running water. In April and May, and then again in September and October, 
many blacks, especially in the country, had to leave school to work in the 
cotton fields, so even a decent junior high school education was a great 
rarity among rural blacks.<P>
Blacks were expected to address whites as "sir" and "mister," as in 
"Yassuh, Mister Charlie."  Whites addressed blacks by their first names. 
This was serious business: one black woman in Canton told me that when she 
was a girl, in the forties, a man who was home visiting from the North was 
shot dead on a sidewalk by a policeman for acting, the woman said, 
"uppity." Another told me about a black grocery-store clerk in the fifties 
who was seen flirting with a white female customer; he was castrated by 
white vigilantes and put on a train out of town.<P>
In the country some blacks owned small farms but most were employees or, 
more likely, tenants. They would live on big farms in unpainted two- and 
three-room wooden shacks, with no plumbing or heat. Families were big, in 
part because the more hands there were to go out in the fields the more 
money the family would make. The sharecropper kept anywhere from half to 
four fifths of the proceeds from his cash crops, which he received from 
the landowner in a settling-up at the end of the year. The sharecropper 
could never come out ahead. He had to borrow from the white man he worked 
for all year long, in order to feed his family and buy his implements, 
feed, and fertilizer. In bad years he would still be behind after the 
settling-up, sometimes so far behind that he would have to leave in a 
hurry; in good years, after all the deductions had been made, he would 
somehow be only a few dollars ahead. The result, fully intended, was an 
ethic of dependency. Sharecroppers had no money and practically no 
education, and they counted on the landowner to provide for them--which he 
did, meagerly. On Saturday afternoon the sharecroppers would travel into 
town on foot or by mule, on Sunday they'd go to church, and on Monday 
they'd be back in the fields.<P>
In town there was a more complicated black society consisting of a 
light-skinned elite of doctors, lawyers, and educators, a dark-skinned 
elite of ministers and businessmen, a skilled-artisan class (carpenters, 
truck drivers, railroad porters), a janitor-and-servant class, and a lower 
class, in which life was meager and chaotic, and bourgeois proprieties 
such as the marriage ceremony were little observed. This last group lived 
on the west side of the Illinois Central railroad tracks, often in tiny 
shacks. Quite often there would be no father in the home; he might be off 
working, or looking for work somewhere else, or he might have just drifted 
away. The black women in Canton could always work in white people's homes, 
but there was very little reliable, steady, decent-paying work for men. A 
small subculture developed based on hustling--prostitution, bootlegging, 
drugs, petty thievery. This was not regarded with great hostility by other 
blacks or by whites, who had a casual attitude about crime in the black 
part of town and sometimes came to the black neighborhoods for illicit 
pleasures. A white man from an old Canton family showed me a novel he had 
found in his attic, written by a relative, apparently in the twenties or 
thirties; one of the characters is a sharp-dressing, sweet-talking young 
black man who lives off women.<BR>
<P>
The idea that black Cantonians began moving to Chicago in droves during 
the Second World War in order to escape segregation is appealing but not 
really true. They moved to escape poverty and in most cases the dignity of 
making a decent living was far more gratifying at first than the dignity 
of having equal rights under the law. There is nothing comparable in 
American life today to the amount of financial gain southern blacks could 
realize instantly by moving less than a thousand miles away, to another 
part of the same country, and getting the kind of unskilled jobs--laborer, 
sales clerk--that were unavailable to them in Canton. David Brown, raised 
in the country outside Canton, left in 1951. He was working in gas station 
for $25 a week. His first week's paycheck at his job in a laundry in 
Chicago, working around the clock, was $200--at the time a large sum by 
any standards. His brother Eddie, who moved in 1961, was supporting a 
pregnant wife and six children on $86 a week take-home pay from a factory 
job in Canton. His first check in Chicago, at a small factory, was $178. 
Oresa Brown, no relation but also raised in the country outside Canton, 
was making cabinets in Memphis for $80 a week. He learned that a white 
co-worker was making $100 for the same job, drove up to Chicago on Labor 
Day in 1962, and found a cabinet-making job the next day that paid $300 a 
week. "The only recruiting from Chicago then was by family members who'd 
bring back a paycheck and show it around," says Robert Chinn, who stayed 
in Canton but estimates that 80 percent of his class (1958) at Cameron 
Street High School left.<P>
It is part of white folklore that many blacks moved to Chicago just to get 
on welfare, which pays more than double in Illinois what it does in 
Mississippi, but this is impossible to substantiate. Though everybody 
knows that welfare can be a trap, its tidal pull toward dependency is much 
stronger on people already on the rolls than on those who are working and 
considering their options. The extremely active Mississippi-Chicago 
grapevine concerns itself mostly with jobs. The gross migration figures 
correspond closely to the availability of jobs for blacks: the first surge 
during the First World War, the big dip during the Depression, and a halt 
in the early seventies, when the unskilled blue-collar job market was 
opening up in the South and closing down in the North. In the severities, 
when welfare payments in Illinois were more than quadruple those in 
Mississippi, there was little migration at all. The handful of studies of 
black migrants portrays them as a typical immigrant group in that they 
are, on average, more motivated and better educated than the people who 
stayed home. They also do better, after a few years, than blacks born in 
the North. Whites born in the North do better than whites who moved there 
from the South, so it is curious that northern-born blacks should do 
worse; the difference must be a testament to the destructive effects of 
the northern ghettos on people raised there. The one group of black 
migrants who in 1970, at the end of the great migration, had an 
above-average rate of welfare dependency consisted of those who had been 
in the North for less than five years and who were in female-headed 
families.<P>
At the time of the migration to the North the sharecroppers in Mississippi 
were moving off the land, because they were being replaced in the fields 
by machines. Heavy tractors and cotton-picking machines became common 
equipment on farms in the fifties; by 1960 what was once the work of fifty 
field hands could be done by only three or four. Typically, the 
sharecroppers were simply dismissed; white farmers in Canton who had 
dozens of people living on their property have no idea where they are 
today. Deserted sharecropper cabins are a common sight in the country 
outside Canton, spectral presences falling down at the edges of open 
fields, some of them in rows, some half a mile from the nearest building 
or road. A few are still occupied, mostly by old people who sometimes 
still dress in homespun and use wood fires to warm themselves and cook.<P>
The sharecroppers moved to town--to Canton or Jackson or even 
Chicago--since there was no place else for them to go. It is impossible to 
produce statistics to prove it, but the common opinion among both blacks 
and whites is that many of them ended up on welfare, living in public 
housing (Canton has housing projects now). The similarities between 
sharecropping and welfare are eerie: dependency on "the man"; more money 
for having more children; little value placed on education; no home 
ownership; an informal attitude toward marriage and childbearing. I met 
several Cantonians who had done well and whose parents had been 
sharecroppers, but in every case they came from a two-parent family and at 
some time during their childhood their parents had scraped together enough 
money to buy a farm of their own and stop sharecropping. In contrast, 
everybody I met in the Robert Taylor Homes who was a migrant from the 
South had been in a sharecropper family right up to the move to Chicago. 
Others in the Chicago underclass have their roots in the southern 
small-town black lower class. For example, one member of the Cameron 
Street High School class of 1955 who ended up in the underclass (she lives 
in North Lawndale, right across the street from the house where Sharon 
Hicks-Bartlett grew up) came from a one-parent family in Canton and 
dropped out of high school in the eleventh grade. She doesn't keep in 
touch with her classmates, didn't come to their thirtieth reunion last 
summer, and, when they call her, either doesn't call back or says she's 
too busy to talk. (It is typical for migrants to Chicago who have not been 
successful to become more and more isolated from family, friends, and 
people with jobs.)<P>
Mildred Nichols told me, "Most people on welfare here, they were on 
welfare there, in a sense, because they were sharecroppers. There they 
were working hard for nothing, now they're not working for nothing. They 
have been mentally programmed that Mister Charlie's going to take care of 
them."<P>
A white farmer I spent some time with in Canton agreed. He said, "We all 
quit the sharecroppers and went to tractors. The government takes care of 
all these niggers now. They live in the housing project in town. They get 
stamps and welfare. They're living better than they ever lived in their 
lives." This man didn't want me to use his name, because he had trouble in 
the sixties with the federal government over shorting his sharecroppers at 
settling-up time and doesn't want more trouble now. On that condition he 
agreed to show me around the countryside just outside of Canton so that I 
could see what the old system was like. He is in his eighties, has a 
tenth-grade education, and drives an aged blue pickup truck. I met him 
outside a place called Jimbo's Cafe and got in the cab, and we took off.<P>
After a while we turned off the highway and bumped down a dirt road to 
some land he owned. He pointed out where the sharecroppers' houses had 
been--for example, to a pile of rotted wood. "Here's a house. Just a 
nigger house. Four rooms, eight, nine people. No running water.,  A well, 
an outside toilet, no heat. I had twelve, thirteen, fourteen families out 
here. They got half the crop, and I charged 'em ten cents on the dollar 
for their money. See, I'd pay 'em on the basis of--I'd go and ask him how 
many kids he had out in the field. Because they had to hoe. I'd let them 
have about twenty up to sixty dollars a month. But they'd always want more 
money! They were a different class of people! You'd pay 'em Friday night 
and it'd be gone Monday morning."<P>
He went on: "I had these niggers working on shares. At the end of the year 
they didn't have much left. They'd never go to school. He'd tell me how 
many he'd have in the field and that's how many I'd look for. They'd go 
out in the field when they were ten or twelve, as soon as they were big 
enough to pull a hoe. If they wouldn't put the kids in the field, why, 
then we'd whup 'em. Then they wouldn't give us any more trouble. We'd tie 
'em up and whup 'em with a plow line."<P>
The farmer had one sharecropper left. He was sixty-six years old and 
suffering from lung disease. We drove out to another pasture to pick him 
up, because the farmer wanted me to talk to him. On the way out, he spoke 
of him fondly: "I done worked that nigger! I worked him from goddamn sunup 
to sunset and then at four in the morning I'd get him up again. See, the 
white folk controlled everything then. They'd see that they didn't have no 
money for no school or teachers or nothing."<P>
The sharecropper, white-haired, gnarled, and leather-skinned, addressed 
the farmer and me as "sir."  He said he had been born in the country, one 
of seventeen children. He hadn't had any school at all. He had eight 
children of his own, two in Canton and six in Champaign, Illinois. His 
wife had gone to St. Louis.<P>
It is not just a way of living that grew in the northern ghettos from 
seeds planted in the South but also a way of thinking. In the Chicago 
ghetto poor blacks use the verb stay instead of live, as in "I stay at 
Robert Taylor Homes." Besides implying an inconstant life, this comes from 
a perfectly sensible sharecroppers' locution: "I stay at the Smiths' 
place."  Another northern ghetto term that comes from southern town life 
getting over, which is less translatable but means, roughly, doing what is 
necessary to survive and, if possible, succeed. While it does not cover 
violence, it would apply to hustling as well as to more legitimate 
pursuits. It comes from the idea of crossing the Jordan River to get to 
the Promised Land. Though the ghetto expression equivalent is not as 
sweet, getting over carries a positive connotation.<P>
At the thirtieth reunion of the Cameron Street High School class of 1955, 
everyone greeted with pure affection a man who had been raised by a 
widowed mother and dropped out of school before high school. Today he is a 
pimp in Jackson. At the reunion he was wearing leather cowboy boots, a 
three-piece silk suit with a shirt open at the neck, and a great deal of 
jewelry (gold chains with bejeweled pendants, enormous gold rings 
sprinkled with diamonds), and he provided an expensive sound system and a 
disc jockey.<P>
The Civil Rights movement in Canton got underway in 1963, when three 
organizers from the New Orleans office of the Congress of Racial Equality 
came to town and started a voter-registration drive, the highlight of 
which was a peaceful demonstration of more than a hundred blacks who 
showed up at the county courthouse on a Saturday to try to register. In 
1964 northern college students descended on Canton for Freedom Summer. 
Blacks began boycotting the businesses that line the courthouse square, 
which wouldn't hire black clerks. Blacks played in the white park and swam 
in the white pool. A black woman from Canton, Annie Devine, went to the 
Democratic Convention, in Atlantic City, as part of the Mississippi 
Freedom Democratic Party Delegation. In 1966 Martin Luther King, Jr., came 
to town on his march through Mississippi with James Meredith; he spoke in 
the gymnasium of the Holy Child Jesus parochial school. White vigilantes 
burned down two black country churches where civil-rights meetings had 
been held, and planted a bomb in another black church, in town, which was 
discovered before it exploded. Twice at the movement's unofficial 
headquarters, a place in the black neighborhood known as Freedom House, 
shots were exchanged between people inside and whites in passing cars.<P>
Today in Canton, there are black elected officials, black firemen, and 
black policemen--but only a few. Blacks hold a majority in the number of 
registered voters, though not a large one. The school system is officially 
integrated but almost all black; integration of the high schools was 
achieved by shutting down the white one and changing the name of the black 
school to Canton Public High School. Most whites go to a private school 
called Canton Academy, founded in 1965. All the streets in the black part 
of Canton are paved now, and just west of town is a new all
black neighborhood of suburban-style brick bungalows. But there are still 
houses in the black part of town particularly in one city block of rental 
properties, that have two rooms, and outhouses instead of indoor toilets, 
and cracks you can see through in their clapboard walls.<P><br><p>
<font size=4><b>IV. Leaving the Ghetto</font></b><P>
The migration to the North transferred the black societies of Canton and a 
hundred towns like it, with all their complexities and problems, to 
Chicago. After that several factors combined to turn the small underclass 
that came up from the South into the large and separate culture that it is 
today. In the city--away from the family, religious, and social structure 
of small-town life back home--all the migrants experienced a loosening of 
the constraints on their behavior (a process that should be familiar to 
readers not only of black writers like Richard Wright and Malcolm X but 
also of Balzac and Dreiser). This was made more pronounced because blacks 
who moved to Chicago from the South were funneled into a ghetto that was 
strikingly crowded, walled off from the rest of society, and different 
from what its residents had known before. The greater prosperity of blacks 
in the North, however, meant that there was a strong leadership in the 
ghettos working to counteract the forces of social entropy. But then the 
working black population made its rapid exodus from the ghettos, leaving 
the underclass disastrously cut off from the rest of the world.<P>
Nearly all the blacks who moved went through some kind of change in their 
way of life from what they had known in the South--even among the 
determinedly ambitious members of the Cameron Street High School class of 
1955 who moved north, there were several cases of childbirth out of 
wedlock. Sometimes these led to marriage and sometimes they didn't; 
usually there was a complicated shuttling of parents and children back and 
forth from Canton, which offered more of a support system. But in none of 
these cases was having children out of wedlock related to either of its 
supposed prime causes, welfare or unemployment. The people involved never 
went on welfare, and they were not unemployed. It had to do instead with 
moving to the big city. Chicago's black elite observed the formalities of 
marriage, but many new arrivals did not, even if they came from a family 
back home in which illegitimacy had never occurred. "When my parents put 
me in the car to Chicago," says one Cantonian, "they were upset because 
they thought it was Sin City. And it was Sin City. It still is. I didn't 
get pregnant on purpose. I don't think anybody ever got pregnant on 
purpose. But now I'm glad, because my kids are grown up and I'm still 
young."<P>
The black illegitimacy rate has risen dramatically over the past twenty 
years, but the problem did not begin with the Great Society programs. 
Every first-hand observer of black society in this country has mentioned 
it in connection with both rural and ghetto life. E. Franklin Frazier, in 
his classic work The Negro Family in the United States (1939), attributed 
most black out-of-wedlock childbirths to southern migrants just arrived in 
the North. Sometimes, he said, migrants became pregnant because of "the 
absence of family traditions and community controls," and sometimes it was 
simply "the persistence in the urban environment of folkways"--namely, the 
lack of a legal marriage ceremony--"that were relatively harmless in the 
rural community."  He cited a variety of statistics for urban black 
illegitimacy at the time, ranging as high as 30 percent of births, and he 
said that in the years just after Emancipation, when there was a more 
literal loosening of traditional bonds, the rate was probably higher.<P>
W. E. B. Du Bois, in The Philadelphia Negro (1899), mentioned 
far-above-average rates of illegitimacy in the poor black neighborhoods of 
Philadelphia in the late 1890s. Gunnar Myrdal's An American Dilemma 
(1944), using 1936 figures, cited a rate of 16 percent for all nonwhites, 
rising to 21 percent in the big cities of the South, where presumably the 
recent migrants from the country would then have been most concentrated 
and freest of social strictures. The nonwhite illegitimacy rate was eight 
times the white rate nationally, and more than sixteen times the rate 
among white first- and second-generation immigrants. Drake and Cayton, in 
Black Metropolis, said that the black lower class in Chicago in the 
forties "not only tolerates illegitimacy, but actually seems almost 
indifferent toward it."  Daniel Patrick Moynihan's 1965 report, "The Negro 
Family," put the 1963 rate at 23.6 percent nationally and as high as 49 
percent in some parts of Harlem. I suspect that all these rates are skewed 
to the low side, because of the practice, common through the mid-sixties, 
of black women in the rural South and northern ghettos saying they were 
married when they were really just living with someone.<P>
I mention these figures in order to dispute the notion that either welfare 
or unemployment is the overarching reason for the explosion in the black 
illegitimacy rate. Drake and Cayton said that in Chicago during the 
depression almost half the black families were on welfare (admittedly, a 
less generous system than today's) or were supported by government work 
programs, but the national black illegitimacy rate hardly rose. During the 
Reagan years, as the welfare rolls have shrunk, the illegitimacy rate has 
gone up. Today. in fact, many more black women have children out of 
wedlock than go on welfare. As for black unemployment, whereas there is 
some statistical match between it and illegitimacy, the match is far from 
perfect. The Moynihan report, after factoring out blacks in the South, 
concluded that black unemployment rates had been double the white rates 
continuously since the early thirties, but the illegitimacy rate had not 
taken off until the 1950s.<P>
The point is not to deny that either welfare or unemployment is a factor 
in rising illegitimacy--both plainly are. But there is a third factor: the 
rapid urbanization of most blacks, followed by the isolation of the black 
lower class in the cities. High illegitimacy has always been much more 
closely identified with blacks than with all poor people or all unemployed 
people or all immigrants. It is a peculiarity of black culture, and within 
than of the black lower class, and within that, of isolation; Frazier 
found the loosest attitude toward marriage in turpentine camps, where 
lower-class black migrant workers lived in rows of cabins deep in the 
southern forests. If, from the late sixties through the early eighties, 
the black urban lower class became significantly more isolated than it 
ever had been before, wouldn't that help explain what happened?<P>
In Chicago and other northern cities there was a direct link between the 
magnitude of the black migration from the South and the degree of 
residential segregation imposed by whites. In 1898 only 11 percent of 
black Chicagoans lived in neighborhoods more than 75 percent black. In 
1900 thirty-three of Chicago's thirty
five wards were at least 0.5 percent black. As soon as the flow of 
migrants became significant, though, white hostility toward blacks surged, 
growing partly from pure prejudice, partly from fear of the importation of 
the social ills created by Jim Crow, partly from intense competition in 
the labor market. It is a pattern of long standing, reminiscent even of 
Canton in the mid-nineteenth century: a primal white antipathy toward the 
black masses, which always leads to the creation of iron restrictions on 
where blacks can live and work. In the summer of 1919, just as Chicago was 
absorbing the first big concentrated wave of southern migrants, white 
gangs started a riot at a Lake Michigan beach when a black swimmer 
ventured into a de facto white stretch of water. Violence, by both blacks 
and whites, spread through much of the South Side, lasted a week, and left 
thirty-eight people dead and 537 injured.<P>
<BR>
In the late forties, with southern blacks again pouring into the city and 
racial tensions rising (there were riots when black veterans tried to move 
into temporary housing in white neighborhoods), Chicago, like many cities, 
began building many public-housing projects. At the time, integrated 
public housing was one of the great liberal causes, and it was also a 
constant, long-standing political demand of blacks. In the liberal dream, 
housing projects would be filled by a racially integrated, clean
living, well-educated working class. Ward politicians with white 
constituents to keep happy were adamantly opposed to integration, though, 
and in 1949 the state legislature passed a law that boxed out the liberals 
by requiring that the Chicago City Council approve all public-housing 
sites. This virtually ensured that projects would be segregated. In 1950 
Robert Taylor, the black chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority, 
resigned in frustration at his inability to get the sites he wanted past 
the council. In 1953 there were protracted riots when one black family 
moved into a white housing project. In 1954 Elizabeth Wood, a Jane 
Addams-style reformer who was the CHA's director and longtime guiding 
spirit, and a great believer in integration, was forced out. From 1957 to 
1968 the CHA built 15,591 housing units-
almost all in high-rise buildings, almost all with black tenants, almost 
all in existing black ghettos. The private housing market was, by 
unwritten law, strictly segregated in most places. By 1970 Chicago was the 
most residentially segregated city in America.<P>
But because the segregation was by race, the ghetto was fairly well 
integrated by class. It was a community, with leaders and 
institutions--poor, with unusual difficulties, but a community 
nonetheless. From the First World War through the mid-sixties the black 
leadership regarded the high crime and low marriage rates of the black 
lower class as problems it had to solve, sometimes with a sigh (the white 
folks on the Gold Coast weren't held responsible for the rough-and-tumble 
of poor-white Chicago). It would, in sociologists' language, help the 
lower class to acculturate. For years the Chicago Defender published what 
a city commission called "instructions on dress and conduct [that] had 
great influence in smoothing down improprieties of manner which were 
likely to provoke criticism and intolerance in the city."  The big South 
Side churches all had memberships across the black economic spectrum, in 
contrast to the segregation by class that prevailed in white Protestant 
churches. The Urban League was founded with the purpose of teaching 
lower-class southern migrants the ways of city life. Drake and Cayton, 
commenting on a slogan made popular by the Defender, wrote, "When 
upperclass and middle-class people speak of 'advancing The Race,' what 
they really mean is creating conditions under which lower-class traits 
will eventually disappear and something approaching the middle
class) way of life will prevail in Bronzeville." The black middle class 
knew that the black lower class would constantly be held up as the reason 
that all blacks had to be kept in certain neighborhoods and certain jobs; 
this was a grievous wrong, which had the side effect of giving the black 
middle class a strong vested interest in the uplift of the black lower 
class. Then the grievous wrong was righted.<P>
In January of 1966 Martin Luther King, Jr., moved into an apartment in 
North Lawndale and announced that he and the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference would be focusing their energies on Chicago for a while. He 
called his Chicago project the "End Slums Campaign" and said it would be 
aimed at improving the conditions in overcrowded, poorly maintained 
inner-city black neighborhoods. During his time in Chicago his campaign 
underwent a crucial shift, though it may not have seemed that way then. 
John A. McDermott, at the time a young Catholic activist working in the 
civil-rights movement and later the publisher of a distinguished Chicago 
newsletter on race relations, says, "King would try one issue after 
another to see what would get a response. 'End Slums' did not generate a 
tremendous amount of popular support. It was not a simple good-versus
evil issue. This was not Montgomery, Alabama. There were no overt racist 
laws or institutions. The problem of racism was more subtle. It was not 
clear it was a conspiracy. Some of the slumlords were black.<P>
"Then a group tried the issue of open housing. We held demonstrations in 
white neighborhoods that wouldn't let blacks in. The white reaction was 
one of panic and outrage. It was on the nightly news, and suddenly people 
saw that a) the laws were not being enforced, and b) white people were 
full of hate and anger. People suddenly woke up and literally poured into 
the movement."<P>
With the last great wave of southern migrants just arrived, North Lawndale 
was frustrated, tense, and swollen--in 1960 its population was 25 percent 
higher than it had been ten years earlier, when North Lawndale was a. 
white neighborhood, and nearly half the population was under twenty years 
old, compared with less than 30 percent in 1950. Gangs were starting to 
become a severe problem. In July of 1966 there was rioting on the West 
Side that required 1,500 National Guardsmen to restore order. The working, 
married, better-established part of the population desperately wanted to 
get out of the neighborhood. On August 5 King led an open
housing demonstration in Marquette Park, then an all-white neighborhood, 
on the Southwest Side. The protection of more than 1,200 policemen did not 
stop his being hit in the head by a rock thrown by whites from the 
neighborhood. A knife thrown at him hit someone else. The demonstrators 
had to be evacuated in buses. On August 26 Mavor Richard Daley, under 
intense pressure from his white precinct captains to stop the 
demonstrations, finally sat down with King at the negotiating table. The 
result was a "summit agreement" devoted almost exclusively to the fair
housing issue rather than to ending slums.<P>
What happened in Chicago is an especially dramatic version of what 
happened all over the country: just as the number of new, poor, migrant 
blacks in the cities reached its all-time peak, the country decided to 
mount a real attack on segregation in housing and employment, and 
otherwise to help those blacks capable of moving closer to the mainstream 
of American society to do so. The result is evident in the census data, as 
we have already seen: there has been another major migration of blacks 
over the past twenty years, out of the ghettos. Even more pronounced than 
the social and economic deterioration of the ghettos between 1970 and 1980 
is their depopulation. North Lawndale was already losing population in the 
late sixties, and in the seventies more than half its black population 
moved away. The tenement house where King lived is a vacant lot now. In 
the same decade the area around Forty-seventh and South Parkway, the old 
vibrant heart of the South Side ghetto, lost 38 percent of its black 
population. The Robert Taylor Homes, whose extremely low rents and solid 
construction for years attracted long waiting lists, are now 20 percent 
vacant. All the ghetto schools, the overcrowding of which in the sixties 
was supposed to be a major cause of low achievement levels, have lost 
enrollment. This isn't happening just in Chicago. The South Bronx lost 37 
percent of its population between 1970 and 1980. More than 100,000 black 
Chicagoans moved to the suburbs in the seventies; 224,000 blacks moved 
from Washington, D.C., to its suburbs, 124,000 from Atlanta to its 
suburbs. These are unusually high numbers for neighborhood population 
loss, and the comparable numbers today would be even higher.<P>
There's no mystery to why so many people left the ghettos. They wanted to 
feel safe on the streets, to send their children to better schools, and to 
live in more pleasant surroundings; in particular, riots drove many people 
away. Probably everyone who could leave did. Many businesses and churches 
(except for tiny "storefront" churches, which often are unaffiliated with 
any organized religion) left with them. What was unusual about the 
migration of the black working population out of the ghettos, compared 
with that of other immigrant groups, is that it was for many years delayed 
and then suddenly made possible by race-specific government policies. 
That's why it happened so fast. One reason that the numbers for 
unemployment and poverty and female-headed families in the ghettos have 
gone up so much is that nearly everyone who was employed and married moved 
away (also, the fertility rate of black married women has dropped 
substantially, which is a sign of assimilation into the middle class). 
Very quickly, around 1970, the ghettos went from being exclusively black 
to being exclusively black lower-class, and there was no countervailing 
force to the venerable, but always carefully contained, disorganized side 
of the ghetto culture. No wonder it flourished in the seventies. The 
"losing ground" phenomenon, in which black ghettos paradoxically became 
worse during the time of the War on Poverty, can be explained partly by 
the abrupt disappearance of all traces of bourgeois life in the ghettos 
and the complete social breakdown that resulted.<P>
Almost all of the Cantonians, when they arrived in Chicago in the late 
fifties and early sixties, lived in the traditional South Side ghetto, and 
then all but the very least fortunate left. Of the many success stories, 
everybody's favorite is that of the Sims family, who prove that it is 
possible to move unscarred from a peasant background in rural Mississippi 
to the upper middle class in one generation. Back home they started out as 
sharecroppers--two parents and thirteen children working a fourteen-acre 
plot that was five miles from the nearest paved road. They did have a leg 
up: Juanita Sims had an unusually high degree of education, which is to 
say some high school; her father owned a thirty-one-acre plot of land, to 
which they eventually moved the family so that they could farm for 
themselves; and J. B. Sims was able to get a job laying pipeline for the 
city.<P>
Wendell Sims, the third daughter, graduated from Cameron Street High 
School in 1955 and immediately moved to Chicago, following the path of her 
sister Theresa, who had come up a few years earlier. On her first day in 
Chicago, Wendell found a job as an assembler at the Bancroft Clock 
factory, for less than a dollar an hour. After nine months she was laid 
off, and found a job in the mailroom at Montgomery Ward. She celebrated 
her thirtieth anniversary at Ward this spring--she's now a supervisor in 
the data-control division. In 1961 she married Jack McIntosh, who had 
moved to Chicago just after his high school graduation in Rayville, 
Louisiana. He has been with AT&T in Skokie, Illinois, since 1960. Today 
they live in a beautiful white brick house in an integrated suburb called 
Matteson, and attend an integrated Lutheran church. They both have college 
diplomas from Chicago State, earned through years at night school.<P>
J. B. Sims, Jr., the oldest son in the family (the initials don't stand 
for anything), came to Chicago in 1957, at the age of eighteen, right 
after the fall harvest was finished. He arrived with $13.50 in his pocket. 
After a week he got a job in a laundry for ninety cents an hour, and soon 
after that he got a second job at another laundry. After several years of 
working two full-time jobs, he got a day job in a grocery store, underwent 
ministerial training at night, and then started a Baptist church in his 
basement--Greater Tabernacle Missionary Baptist. The church flourished and 
moved to larger quarters. In 1975 he moved to a spacious brick house on 
the South Side. In 1978 he started a bus company that takes Chicago 
children to school, under contract from the board of education. In 1980 he 
felt secure enough to quit his job at the grocery store. Today he has 
forty-eight buses and owns a service station and a fourteen-unit apartment 
building. The church is just about to reopen in a new half
million-dollar building. He is married, for the second time, and has one 
daughter and one stepdaughter.<P>
As the Sims family, and the rest of the Cantonians who made it, did better 
over the years, they fanned out steadily in the city, to the new 
working-class and lower
middleclass black areas that were opening up in the seventies, mostly in 
formerly white areas to the south and west of the South Side ghetto. All 
of them now see the ghetto culture as unhealthy, something to keep one's 
kids away from. Mildred Nichols's sister, Doris Smith, teaches at Du Sable 
High School, most of whose students live in the Robert Taylor Homes, but 
sends her children to Kenwood, a much better public high school near the 
University of Chicago.<P>
Mildred Nichols's two children are both married and both working, and have 
two children each. Andre lives in Canton, Jacqueline in Chicago. Over the 
years, Nichols has helped two of her siblings move to Chicago to go to 
graduate school at Northwestern. This year, on Valentine's Day, she 
married William Burton, a security officer, and together they bought a 
neat brick bungalow on the far South Side.<P>
As most of the Cantonians who have moved to Chicago have thrived, so has 
the ghetto culture that grew in Chicago. Now the ghetto is coming home to 
Mississippi. In Canton today, at the black playground and down the street 
from the civil-rights movement's Freedom House, there are walls with 
spray-painted symbols of the Chicago gangs: the six-pointed star of the 
Disciples, the crossed pitchforks of the Vice Lords.<P>
On the evening of April 25, 1985, a young man named Percy Walker, 
nicknamed Squinky, got into a fight in a Canton bar with a man named Larry 
Ross. Later that night Ross stopped his car outside Walker's girlfriend's 
house, pulled out a shotgun, and fired at Walker point-blank. Walker died 
a few hours later in a hospital in Jackson. For his funeral a group of 
friends and relatives came down from Chicago in a phalanx of Cadillacs, 
which were decorated with Vice Lords symbols. Walker's life is a capsule 
version of the growth and spread of the underclass. His mother never 
married his father, who was from a sharecropper family, didn't have much 
school, and moved from Canton to Chicago shortly after Walker was born. 
(There the father was a hustler and was killed in a fight in a bar.) 
Walker was sent to Chicago to live with relatives when he was a teenager; 
he dropped out of school and was arrested for rape. On visits back to 
Canton he began dating a girl who lived down the street from his mother, 
and in 1983 they had a daughter. Before she was three she learned when 
people said "Vice Lords" to her to answer with the proper hand signal.

	<font size=5>M</font>ANY of the battles to come, as a Democratic Administration faces a 

Republican Congress, will be the sort of meanspirited partisan scuffles 

that Americans love to deride. But sometimes the smoke and dust of the 

fray will conceal a matter of principle, even philosophy--as in the case 

of the reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act.<P>

Like many laws, the act must periodically be reauthorized, which is to say 

that the federal government must occasionally renew its own authority to 

fund the act's enforcement and administration. Reauthorization was 

scheduled for 1992, but Congress postponed action indefinitely--its 

members did not want to touch the issue in an election year. In the 

meantime, frustration with the law has been building. The inevitable 

debate will probably take place this year, perhaps within the next few 

months. It will be bloody, as they say inside the Beltway. At issue will 

be the nation's biological heritage, more or less, and a vision of its 

economic future. Conflict will be engaged by the usual operatives: 

lobbyists representing some of the nation's most powerful interest 

groups.<P>

Opponents call for narrowing the scope of the law, claiming that society 

is spending billions to protect the Penland beardtongue, the fat 

pocketbook mussel, the giant kangaroo rat, and a cavalcade of other 

creatures with absurd-sounding names. The Endangered Species Act, in their 

view, threatens to usurp so much private property and capsize so many jobs 

that it may wreck our very economy. Proponents declare the law 

inadequately enforced and demand that its protections be extended to more 

species at a faster rate; otherwise, they claim, we risk trashing our 

biological life

support system. Weaken or fortify?--that is the tenor of the debate. One 

question is rarely addressed: Can the law be more responsive to the 

concerns of both sides?<P>

The Endangered Species Act orders the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a 

branch of the Department of the Interior, to protect species recognized as 

endangered, without regard to cost. The goal is to banish extinction from 

the United States. Unfortunately, the present system has failed utterly to 

do this. Species are going extinct anyway, and the threats are 

multiplying. For every species that Fish and Wildlife has successfully 

removed from the endangered list in the past two decades, it has added 

more than <I>one hundred</I> others.<P>

This outcome would have surprised the members of Congress who passed the 

law, in 1973. Implicit in the debate over the act was the assumption, 

still held by many conservationists today, that endangered species could 

be saved without sacrifice: if development affects a species here, we can 

just move the development or the species someplace else. Since then it has 

become clear that the reasons species become endangered are not always 

trivial, and that saving them is not so simple. <P>

Anyone who has walked in the western parts of Albany, New York, can see 

the problem. A hundred years ago the area hosted one of the world's 

largest populations of the Karner Blue butterfly, a lovely little bug that 

appeared on the endangered list at the end of 1992. The former haunts of 

the butterfly have been taken over by an interstate highway, a power 

substation, a campus of the State University of New York, and several 

hundred middle-class homes. In other words, the butterfly was endangered 

by the satisfaction of ordinary human desires to drive around, switch on 

lamps at night, learn about interesting things, and live in a nice home. 

<P>

Because human interests cannot be ignored, not all species can be saved. 

Yet the current system demands the unattainable: all species must be 

saved, and human interests must be ignored. Amplifying this dissonance has 

been an unwillingness in Congress to award the Fish and Wildlife Service 

more than a paltry budget to enforce and administer the law. As a result, 

the agency has been driven to impose conservation tasks on those 

private-property owners who are unlucky enough to have land that sustains 

endangered species. To be safe from possible prosecution, they must verify 

that using their property will cause the creatures no harm. Endangered 

species thus become a liability that encourages otherwise responsible 

citizens to call in the bulldozers at the first glimpse of an endangered 

bird or lizard. <P>

Both sides of the debate recognize these flaws, but they disagree on how 

to remedy them. Supporters of the law cling to its impossible goal, 

calling for increased budgets and stricter enforcement. This would turn 

Fish and Wildlife Service biologists into ecological mandarins, making 

choices for entire regions which must favor the interests of other species 

and not people. Such overbearing regulation would increase the incentives 

for landowners to destroy pristine land, with predictably disastrous 

environmental consequences.<P>

Not that opponents have a better answer. Many call for compensating 

landowners for any decrease in the value of their property brought on by 

species protection. But this amounts to little more than replacing 

ecological mandarins with economic mandarins, whose decisions would be 

equally predictable and equally disastrous. <P>

What will it take to do a better job of saving our natural heritage? The 

foremost change must be to recognize that our values are manifold. If we 

valued only trees and streams, we wouldn't hesitate to save them, no 

matter what the cost. If we wanted only cement and steel, any part of 

nature beyond the minimum necessary to sustain life would become 

expendable. If the past is any guide, the debaters in Washington will 

blindly favor one side or the other. Progress will be possible only if the 

unrealistic demands of the Endangered Species Act are scaled back and 

supplemented with a way of satisfying some of the needs of affected 

landowners.<P>

The demands of the current law should not be eliminated entirely, though. 

Even if a species fails a strict cost-benefit test, few people would 

support its extinction without pausing to reflect. Protecting species is a 

task that deserves a place in the political life of our country, alongside 

other basic values such as protecting health, maintaining the nation's 

defense, and fostering education. <P>

In other words, a balance must be struck. Part of that balance should be 

for landowners to concede that our ecological inheritance is important 

enough to justify some regulation of their land. Another, equally 

important part of the balance should be for conservationists to concede 

that development plans that threaten species are reflections of the human 

desire to have stores, roads, schools, homes, and the like. The two 

concessions point in the same direction: neither species nor developers 

should win all the time. The question is when and where each should 

prevail.<P>

Moneyed interests, of course, will always threaten species and other 

environmental assets that cannot pay their way. The most appropriate 

counterweight is not to outlaw human nature but to award some money to 

environmental protection. Merely throwing money at the current system, 

however, will only exacerbate the problems inherent in the Endangered 

Species Act.<P>

One solution would be to create an Endangered Species Trust Fund, to 

promote conservation in ways more compatible with American values and 

culture. The fund could underwrite a variety of programs, from ecological 

research to educational advertising to conservation assistance to outright 

land purchase. It could encourage landowners to share their land with 

species in trouble. The state of Wisconsin, for example, already has such 

a program, which covers seven species on the federal endangered list. 

Landowners agree to a nonbinding protection plan, and are rewarded with a 

picture of the species, a certificate of appreciation, ongoing species

management help, and, most important, the belief that they are voluntarily 

doing the right thing. According to the state, most landowners happily go 

along, although the program is unlikely to deter big development plans.<P>

Not all species can be protected by voluntary programs, of course, and 

where necessary the trust fund could help subsidize conservation efforts 

by landowners. One possible model is a program sponsored by the Defenders 

of Wildlife, a Washington-based conservation group, which offers a $5,000 

"bounty" to each landowner who has an established wolf den on his or her 

property. The trust could also promote commercial practices that are 

environmentally friendlier but costlier than current practices. As the 

Soil Conservation Service does for farmers and soil conservation, a 

Biological Conservation Service, funded by the trust, could encourage 

foresters, ranchers, and miners to modify their activities, thus 

reducing--though not eliminating--harm to endangered species.<P>

In critical cases the trust fund would have the tools to restrict land use 

greatly, albeit in a noncoercive manner. It could take a lesson from The 

Nature Conservancy, which protects some biologically valuable land by 

paying for a conservation easement--a legal contract that forbids 

developing a piece of property but allows the landowner to earn income 

through ecologically benign activities, such as certain types of 

agriculture. As a final resort, in places where almost any human activity 

threatens the other inhabitants, the trust fund could buy land and protect 

it as a biological preserve. <P>

Such an effort would be expensive, but it could go a long way toward 

removing our natural heritage from the mire of partisan bickering. Indeed, 

the idea of a trust fund has quietly attracted interest from environmental 

organizations and from advocates of property rights. Combined with a 

scaled-back Endangered Species Act, the fund could help the nation provide 

environmental protection with less social conflict. Isn't that what it 

means to make the law responsive to the people and the causes it 

serves?<p>

	<font size=5>T</font><html><head>he South Vietnamese evacuees of 1975 were sure they would be back in their

Saigon homes within months. Their stay in the United States would not even be

long enough to qualify as an exile. But the Hanoi government, led by the jungle

soldiers who banished South Vietnam from the map, has proved durable, and as a

result the United States continues to inherit tens of thousands of new refugees

every year. The community of Vietnamese-Americans now numbers more than

700,000, and is close to the size of much older communities of Japanese-,

Korean-, and Indian-Americans.<p>



<p>



Although the Vietnamese in America were at first a homogenous group, in the

course of five separate waves of immigration they have encompassed a diverse

cross-section of Vietnamese society, including Kinh Vietnamese (the majority),

Chinese, Khmer, and people of at least a dozen other ethno-linguistic

backgrounds. The refugees belong to a wide range of religions, including

Catholicism, Buddhism, and Cao Daiism, the last being a religious sect that

regards Victor Hugo, Sun Yat-sen, and William Shakespeare, among others, as

guiding spirits. The Kinh are also divided by long-standing regional

differences, which have far more impact on language and world view than such

differences typically do in America. The northerners among the refugees, who

fled to South Vietnam immediately after the fall of the French at Dien Bien

Phu, in 1954, were weaned on harsh weather and infertile soils and are known

for their rigorous work ethic. The native southerners, in contrast, have for

centuries been thought to exude the attitude of a people who were "born with a

spoonful of rice in their mouths." And, finally, there are distinctions in

education and class status which cross all demographic categories.<p>



<p>



With most ethnic groups, demographic factors such as these often determine how

well new immigrants and refugees manage to reconstruct their lives in this

country. Vietnamese-Americans represent a major exception to that pattern: the

most successful and least successful groups have very similar demographic

profiles. Both groups have disproportionate numbers of ethnic Kinh, Catholics,

transplanted northerners, and those who held military and political positions

in South Vietnam.<p>



<p>



This similarity is a cruel irony, but it is no accident. As one might expect,

many of the successful Vietnamese, who, true to popular stereotypes, have

overachieving children, new cars, and close-knit families, are those who were

evacuated from Saigon in 1975. In what amounts to an unplanned experiment in

human resilience, a large portion of their South Vietnamese demographic

group--primarily families headed by younger officials and officers--did not

leave Vietnam at that time. Members of this stay-behind group were not included

in official contingency plans, unable to buy their way out of the country, or

not convinced that leaving was the safest option. This group represented the

greatest threat to Hanoi's rule, and many of them (mostly men but also some

women) were soon shepherded into "re-education camps"--an Orwellian euphemism

for brutal jungle prisons.<p>



<p>



Now that the Hanoi government has closed down all the re-education camps,

former political prisoners are arriving daily in the United States under a

special State Department resettlement program. Every one of the former

prisoners has been permanently and often debilitatingly scarred, and most are

left with ambitions only for their children. Even those prisoners who arrived

several years ago show few signs of rising out of poverty and improving their

prospects the way that those who came earlier did. More than 20,000 arrived

last year alone, and as many as 100,000 more are expected to arrive in the next

few years.<p>



<p>



The timing could hardly have been worse for the former prisoners. President

Clinton has recently edged closer to normalizing relations with Vietnam, which

would in effect welcome the country back into the community of nations. What

makes this particularly painful for the former prisoners is that successful

1975 evacuees, especially younger professionals and businesspeople, are leading

the charge for normalization. Even some of those who are founding members of

right-wing terrorist groups (a typically unsubtle name is the Vietnamese Party

to Exterminate the Communists and Restore the Nation) have started quietly

returning to Vietnam to make under-the-table business deals and capitalize on

Vietnam's newly booming economy.<p>



<p>



Had the recent immigrants escaped from Vietnam in 1975 or shortly thereafter,

they, too, might be jockeying for business opportunities, or at least warming

to the possibility of returning to Vietnam as visitors. Instead the newcomers

simply feel betrayed by the evacuees who are doing so. "A number of those who

came before us are changing their mind about the VC government," says one

former prisoner who arrived in Boston in 1990. "Some are people who have no

education, no political awareness. We never blame these people. . . . Who we

blame and hate are the leaders during the war, politicians, people with high

education, Ph.D.s trained in the U.S. or Europe. They are trying to shake hands

with the VC government. They think they can change them. We know there's no

way."<p>



<p>



Unlike its Vietnam War campaigns, the U.S. government's initial efforts to

resettle the refugees were relatively swift and efficient. By the end of May,

1975, the U.S. armed forces had transported by ship and plane 120,000

Vietnamese--and 5,500 Cambodians and Laotians--to four domestic military bases,

initiating the most intensive refugee-resettlement program in U.S. history. The

few refugees who could show that they had at least $4,000 per family member

were permitted to leave the military bases immediately to make their own

arrangements. The rest had to wait, like orphans, for American families,

religious groups, or companies (looking for cheap labor) to sponsor them.<p>



<p>



The resettlement planners, having learned from failed attempts with the Cuban

exiles of the 1960s, went to great lengths to distribute the needy refugees

geographically, even if that meant stranding lone Vietnamese families in rural

Alaska. But by the time the next wave of refugees--the boat people--began

arriving in the country, in 1978, Vietnamese had inevitably begun clustering.

The majority of the first boat people were ethnically Chinese, and many found

housing and support in urban Chinatowns. (These refugees, who speak Vietnamese

with distinctively flattened tones, had taken to the seas when the Vietnamese

government started cracking down in the southern city of Cholon, which had been

the hub of a large Chinese merchant class for more than a century.) The group

that fled immediately after the Chinese was composed largely of coastal

fishermen, who had easy access to the most common route of escape. These boat

people found economic opportunity (and, unfortunately, intense racial

prejudice) along the Gulf Coast. Cities that acquired large Vietnamese

populations include Houston, New Orleans, Chicago, Seattle, Minneapolis, and

Arlington, Virginia. But in the 1980s the place that attracted the most new

refugees, and the most secondary migrants, was California--the weather was

warm, welfare benefits were generous, public education was excellent, and the

economy had just begun to boom.<p>



<p>



Today more than half of all U.S. Vietnamese live in California--perhaps 125,000

in the north and 275,000 in the south. Strangely enough, the highest

concentration of Vietnamese outside Vietnam is in Orange County, which is often

assumed to be one of the whitest counties in America. Although the established

Vietnamese, who vote heavily Republican, have not changed Orange County's

conservative voting patterns, they have left their mark in almost every other

way. The major example is Little Saigon, in the otherwise unremarkable town of

Westminster.<p>



<p>



For those who have visited the real Saigon, Orange County's version won't

conjure up images of the original. Most notably, there are no obvious red-light

districts, French-influenced high-rise buildings, or bicycle taxis.

Essentially, Little Saigon is a clean, unassuming mile-and-a-half-long strip of

suburban shopping malls, packed with about 1,000 stores, offices, and

restaurants. The concentration of signs written in Vietnamese (easily

distinguishable from other Asian lettering because Vietnamese uses Roman

characters) is the only real giveaway. The no-frills architecture is almost

completely post-1960s southern California. (One exception is the prominent

Today Plaza mall, which actually looks more Chinese than Vietnamese; Frank Jao,

who developed it and many other malls, is ethnically Chinese.)<p>



<p>



But inside Little Saigon's buildings the effect is pure Vietnam. Even in the

better restaurants there are very few Caucasians--many fewer, in fact, than one

finds in most overcrowded, intimidating inner-city Chinatowns. The area has

twenty-five Vietnamese-language newspapers, and its stores carry every comfort

of home--even, in the case of the area's thirty busy travel agencies, home

itself. And the country's first Vietnamese elected official, the gregarious and

blunt Westminster city councilman Tony Lam, can be seen regularly holding forth

with constituents over bowls of traditional noodle soup.<p>



<p>



No other city in America has such a large and prosperous Little Saigon, and

though Vietnamese are among the country's fastest-growing minority groups,

probably none ever will, because Little Saigon is the product of a uniquely

congenial confluence of factors. The original Vietnamese settlers ended up in

Orange County because the area was home to many U.S. veterans of the war, who

made trips to the county's Camp Pendleton after the evacuation of Saigon to

sponsor South Vietnamese they had worked and fought beside. At the time, Orange

County had very few immigrants, and consequently a wealth of available manual

jobs, so the Vietnamese had little trouble finding work. That is not to say

that the first few years were easy. The manual jobs were demeaning, especially

for formerly wealthy and prominent men, and partly as a result the rates of

domestic disputes and divorce increased markedly. But the entry-level jobs

allowed the Orange County refugees to wean themselves from public assistance

very quickly. In other parts of the country jobs were much harder to come by.

Like the refugees themselves, the U.S. economy was suffering from the

aftershocks of war.<p>



<p>



During the 1980s, with Ronald Reagan as President, the California Vietnamese

blossomed. Defense industries, heavily concentrated in southern California,

provided a steady supply of high-tech assembly and engineering jobs--an irony

that was not lost on the war-weary refugees. At the same time, investors from

Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan were making record investments in American

real estate, owing to political and economic skittishness at home. Westminster

was attractive to these Chinese investors for two reasons. First, they felt

comfortable dealing with the town's ethnically Chinese refugees, many of whom

had run South Vietnam's biggest businesses. Second, while real-estate prices

were skyrocketing in most of Orange County, Westminster was an undervalued

backwater of mobile homes and strawberry fields.<p>



<p>



As Chinese money flowed into the community, ethnic Vietnamese, including many

boat people, began pooling their own capital by means of time-honored private

investment schemes, and they, too, built storefront businesses in the area.

Their specialty was professional services such as insurance, medicine, and

architecture. "The conditions were perfect for the first- and second-wave

refugees," says Yen Do, a former Saigon war reporter who founded the highly

respected daily newspaper Nguoi Viet (The Vietnamese People) in 1978. "Through

our entry-level jobs we had an entree into the professions, and we developed

quickly. We bought houses in the nicer suburbs. We started thinking like

Americans."<p>



<p>



That the initial waves of boat people contributed at all to the growth of

Little Saigon is impressive, because their escapes to the United States were

far more traumatic than those of the first settlers. For all the careful

preparation that went into securing boats and inconspicuously accumulating

supplies, many of those who fled were turned back by coastal patrols and sent

to prison camps. Those who made it to the open seas were preyed upon by Thai

pirates. More than 30 percent of all boat people died at sea. Even those who

reached their destinations--Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, or Indonesia--were

immediately corralled in disease-ridden refugee camps, where most faced a wait

of a year or more before receiving asylum in the West.<p>



<p>



For many of the first boat people, especially teenagers and young adults, the

ordeal of escape was like high-altitude training for athletes. "I risked my

life to come here," says the graphic designer Nam Nguyen, who arrived as a

twelve-year-old in 1979. "The main source of my energy is my desire to make the

most of my escape." Even many who are not well educated have been so successful

in business that they fill Little Saigon's flashy nouveau-riche nightclub set

and have forced some class reshuffling, according to Oanh Ress, who is involved

with organizations that provide humanitarian assistance to Vietnam. "Rural

people and ordinary soldiers who never had opportunities in Vietnam now own

many businesses and are quite rich."<p>



<p>



Timing is everything. The Vietnamese who have arrived since the late 1980s--the

former political prisoners and, before them, a large contingent of Amerasians

and late-arriving boat people--have fared very poorly. Federal refugee

assistance has dropped precipitously, from thirty-six months of benefits in

1975 to only eight months today. Jobs are scarcer. There is a housing crisis.

In one sense the existence of a comfortable, self-sufficient community like

Little Saigon might seem to give the newest refugees an advantage over their

predecessors. But, sadly, it often has the opposite effect. "The former

prisoners and the other new arrivals have come into this ghetto and have stayed

here," Do says. "They are addicted to the ghetto. They don't need to learn

English, and so they don't. Eighty percent of them speak Vietnamese

exclusively, and many sit around watching kung fu movies dubbed in Vietnamese."

The former prisoners have received much help from Little Saigon's impressive

network of not-for-profit assistance programs, but many successful exiles have

turned away from newer arrivals. "The former prisoners remind the others of

war, and they have been ignored for that reason," says Do's

twenty-seven-year-old daughter, Anh, echoing a sentiment familiar to U.S.

veterans of the Vietnam War. "And people are too busy and ambitious to help

them. People just don't have the time to take these people by the hand and to

teach them English and to get them out of their depression."<p>



<p>



The problems are magnified in cities with smaller Vietnamese populations.

Although the newcomers who live in Little Saigon may receive little direct

help, at least they indirectly benefit from the prosperity of the successful

Vietnamese; shopkeepers and professionals have a huge stake in keeping Little

Saigon safe and clean, and they reinvest much of their profits there. In

metropolitan Boston, which is typical of cities with mid-sized Vietnamese

populations (and, incidentally, is home to the last President of South

Vietnam), there is little reinvestment and almost no contact between successful

and unsuccessful refugees. As soon as refugees begin to earn a decent living,

they flee the low-rent Vietnamese hub in the Dorchester section of the city to

establish churches, temples, stores, and restaurants in the suburbs.<p>



<p>



Unlike Little Saigon, the Dorchester enclave feels at once depressed and tense.

Not only has it been left exclusively to the most vulnerable refugees; it is

also an inner-city melting pot of blacks, Latinos, and Irish-Americans which is

often on the verge of boiling over. Unemployment among the Dorchester

Vietnamese is high, approximately 20 percent--50 percent if one includes all

those who are still receiving federal refugee-assistance checks. There are few

Vietnamese-owned businesses, and those that exist almost never hire people

outside the proprietors' family. Prior English-language training and military

education have not led to jobs, so the newcomers play up more-tangible skills:

under "work experience" one ten-year prisoner's resume reads, "Re-education

camp in Quang Nam province. Kitchen helper and farmer." Stitching together Red

Sox caps or stocking merchandise at Filene's Basement discount department store

is considered a good position.<p>



<p>



The physical and psychological common denominator of newcomers on both coasts

and everywhere in between has been severe headaches and depression. Health-care

providers attribute the most acute trauma to the difficulty of adapting to the

new country. The first shock is that of unmet expectations. Often family

members and friends gave inaccurately rosy reports in letters home. Many in the

first groups of former prisoners had heard rumors--perhaps spread maliciously

by Communist officials--that they could expect a check from the U.S. government

for fifteen or more years of military back pay, along with keys to a house and

a car. Then there is the breakdown of the family. In the new social milieu even

some of the most obedient, hardworking children rebel against the strict

Confucian authority of their fathers, and many wives rebel against their

husbands. Other children join hard-core Vietnamese gangs, which specialize in

well-planned invasions of the houses of other Vietnamese-Americans, who for the

most part do not trust their savings to banks. Gangs are not a major concern in

Boston or other East Coast cities, but in Little Saigon they are such a problem

that the councilman Tony Lam has called for deporting violent gang members to

Vietnam.<p>



<p>



Especially for those who were locked away in re-education camps, depression and

stagnation are also the result of having endured the greatest postwar horrors.

"The killing fields of Cambodia were more humane," says Jade Ngoc Huynh, a camp

survivor and the author of the forthcoming memoir South Wind Changing. "It is

merciful to kill fast. In the prison camps they worked us to a slow death." Two

months after the fall of Saigon, South Vietnamese military officers, students,

and professionals were told to report for ten days to one month of political

study. Strangely, no one seemed to suspect that this was a ruse, and hardly

anyone resisted. The peasant guards delighted in breaking their urban,

once-pampered prisoners through psychological and physical torture, but

invariably the form of abuse that former prisoners remember and describe most

vividly is starvation. At the daily meal a group of fifty prisoners might be

forced to share enough rotten rice to sustain one person. To survive, the

prisoners began to eat cockroaches, banana peels, and the cigarette butts

discarded by guards.<p>



<p>



Normalization will only bring more anguish to the survivors. While the

newcomers wait for milestones in the more distant future--the clearing of the

Southeast Asian refugee camps, the return of nationalized property, or the

demise of the current government--the more successful Vietnamese-Americans will

return to Vietnam in droves, to visit parents and other relatives, to provide

humanitarian assistance, and to cash in on the marketable side effects of exile

in the West, a process that has already begun. Even those first-wave

professionals who now ostensibly oppose normalization will find returning

palatable. This conclusion draws support from the recent actions of the other

half of the world's overseas Vietnamese: the refugees who settled in Europe,

Australia, and Canada. The non-American overseas Vietnamese have not been bound

by the U.S. trade embargo and are several steps ahead of their American

counterparts in establishing commercial and humanitarian projects in Vietnam.<p>



<p>



Most tangibly, diplomatic normalization means that the United States will

establish an embassy in Hanoi (reportedly, land has been set aside for that

purpose), and the Vietnamese who are naturalized American citizens can expect

to receive in Vietnam full legal protection from the U.S. government. For

businesspeople, normalization means that U.S. companies will be clamoring for

Vietnamese-American consultants to help them negotiate their way through

Vietnam's overwhelming bureaucracy and corruption. Vietnamese-American-owned

businesses, too, will find it much easier to take advantage of the cheap and

relatively skilled labor of Vietnam; now it is technically illegal for any

American citizen to trade with Vietnam (though that has not prevented many

Vietnamese-Americans from secretly buying large tracts of land around Saigon,

or from opening restaurants and hotels, or from running lucrative

money-changing businesses). Normalization will also create a huge market for

Vietnamese-Americans with professional and technical skills, a fortunate

coincidence for the many Vietnamese computer technicians and engineers who have

been laid off from high-tech jobs in the United States as a result of recent

defense-budget cuts.<p>



<p>



Meanwhile, because U.S. refugee-assistance budgets have dwindled, much of the

financial responsibility for the newest refugees has shifted to the local

Vietnamese communities. The former prisoners, therefore, have become

increasingly dependent on the wealthy, established

Vietnamese-Americans--precisely those refugees whose hearts and wallets are

most likely to be in Vietnam. The former prisoners will survive--but as a

leaderless, distrustful mass whose tightest bonds are depression and anger.<p>

<blockquote>

	<i><font size=4>Overshadowed by the Senate,

overpowered by the executive branch, and embarrassed by its own misdeeds, the

House of Representatives suffers from a loss of pride and prestige. A new wave

of reform-minded Congressmen and its pugnacious new speaker are determined to

restore some of House's former glory. But privately many members worry that

they are destined to be the errand boys of government.</i></font><p>

	

	

	<pre>

	

	</pre>

	

	<font size=5>J</font>erry Ambro caught on early. He was elected to the House of Representatives

from a traditionally Republican area on Long Island in 1974. He became a leader

among the seventy-six brash new Democratic congressmen who arrived in

Washington the Following January, determined to remodel and Lionize the

institution. They deposed three committee chairmen, pushed through a number of

significant procedural changes, and established themselves as a force to be

reckoned with. It was a heady, exhilarating experience. <p>



<p>



Before many months had passed, however, Ambro was confronted with a typical

problem: the Army Corps of Engineers was planning to dump 250,000 cubic yards

of dredged spoil containing heavy metals into Long Island Sound. Although the

dumping area was technically in Connecticut waters, Ambro's constituents were

alarmed that the polluted material would drift in their direction, and they

thought their congressman should be able to do something about it. Ambro tried.

He buttonholed his subcommittee chairman on the House Public Works Committee,

contacted the regional administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,

denounced the Corps' plan as "sheer lunacy," issued press statements, wrote

letters, and generally fulminated. But he got nowhere.<p>



<p>



One morning in May 1975, Ambro was wandering down a corridor in the Rayburn

House Office Building when he heard a deep southern voice boom out from behind

him: "Jerome, come in here." It was Congressman Robert Jones, a

fourteenth-termer from Alabama, then the chairman of Public Works, inviting

Ambro into his office for a chat and a drink. (Ambro is no prude, but he

remembers being surprised to find himself drinking sixteen-ounce cans of beer

with his chairman before 10 A.M.) Jones wanted to reminisce about his days

working on the Long Island Railroad during World War II, and Ambro was glad to

listen.<p>



<p>



The potentate from Alabama had taken a shine to the newcomer from New York on

his committee. "What can we do for you up there, Jerome?" he asked. "Do you

need a new highway?" Ambro, making every effort to be tactful, explained that

the building or expansion of highways was not exactly the way to please his

people these days. "Mr. Chairman," he said sheepishly, "I have another problem,

one that I don't think you could do anything about." He explained the Corps'

project. Jones reached for the phone and called Major General J. W. Morris,

director of civil works for the Corps of Engineers. "General, I think you've

made a terrible mistake," said the chairman, "and I've got a bright young

congressman right here in my office who will explain why." Jones shoved the

receiver at the dumbfounded Ambro, who sputtered out his objections. Returning

to the phone, the chairman suggested that the next day would be an appropriate

time for the Corps to deliver a letter of termination on the experiment to

Ambro's office. Three men in uniform appeared there early the next morning to

do exactly that. "Ambro defeating the Army on big dumping in Sound" read one of

the headlines back in his district.<p>



<p>



That unscheduled session in Jones's office became something of a watershed in

Ambro's congressional career. "The ways you think of doing things when you come

down here--raising multifaceted arguments, using rational logic--aren't always

the best ways," he has realized. Now in his second term, he still talks like a

rebel, but he knows better how to use his subcommittee assignments for maximum

political advantage, how to protect the interests of Long Island, how to

stage-manage just enough publicity on an issue to get public hearings launched,

and where to go for help when he needs it. "My idealism has not eroded," Ambro

insists with a grin; "I'm just learning how to get things done." And that, say

the sages and the old-timers, is how it has always been.<p>



<p>



Ambro may have made his peace with the House and its folkways, but not everyone

is so lucky. In fact, beneath the rich leather and the marble, beyond the

House's ornate facade and its grandiloquent discourse, lies a troubled

institution uncertain about its role. It is torn between respect for its stodgy

traditions and the impulse to reform its way to public esteem. Some 58 percent

of its members have arrived since 1970, during a period of great upheaval in

the nation's political and social life, and the House has become the scene of

intense generational conflict. The senior members love what they used to have,

but they see both the fun and the glory slipping away. The newer congressmen

got where they are by running against the House: now they must sustain

themselves by continuing the attack from within. Virtually everyone in the

House feels overworked and under-appreciated, albeit well-paid and handsomely

maintained. Congressmen seem doomed to be caricatured as ignoble political

animals condemned to a lower status than their brethren in the Senate, utterly

unable to compete with the policy and image machines of the executive branch.<p>



<p>



There is much talk in its corridors and committee rooms of a new House, a

modern political body that is reformed and automated, participatory and

democratic with a small "d." But the sad reality is a shadow the House's former

self, a chaotic and self-conscious place where people who pretend to be

statesmen actually spend most of their time running errands, doing little

services, and making small adjustments to decisions rendered elsewhere. How

well each member does those demeaning jobs generally determines how long he or

she will be permitted to stay and pretend to do others.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The framers of the Constitution had something grand in mind when they designed

the House. They wrote the legislative branch into the federal charter as the

first branch of government, and they intended the House to be the first and

more important part of that branch, the only unit in the new system that would

be chosen from the very start by direct popular election. As George Mason of

Virginia told the Constitutional Convention in 1787, the House would be "the

grand depository of the democratic principles of the Government." Whereas

members the Senate would be selected by the state legislatures (as they were

until 1913), and would therefore protect the interests of the states, the

representatives, according to Mason, "should sympathize with their

constituents, should think as they think and feel as they feel, and...for these

purposes should even be residents among them." To reinforce the point, the

entire membership of the House would stand for election every two years (a

compromise between those who favored a one-year term and those who favored

three). No one would be--and no one ever has been appointed to the House.<p>



<p>



In the early decades of the Republic, the Senate drifted, unsure of itself and

its role. Some states in fact, used their Senate seats as consolation prizes

for defeated candidates for the House. Little wonder. Most of the action was

concentrated in the House: all revenue bills originated there; it had the sole

power of impeachment; and when no presidential candidate had a clear majority

in the Electoral College, the House would choose the winner. It picked Thomas

Jefferson over Aaron Burr in 1801 and John Quincy Adams over Andrew Jackson in

1825. For that reason and others, Adams loved the House. Two years after his

term as President ended, he was elected congressman by the people of Quincy,

Massachusetts ("My election as President of the United States was not half so

gratifying to my inmost soul," he said), and Adams stayed in that job for

seventeen years, finally collapsing on the House floor and dying in the

speaker's office in 1848. Another statesman who tried the Senate, but later

moved on and up to the House, was Henry Clay of Kentucky.<p>



<p>



But it was the Senate that grew more gracefully. Expanding neatly with two new

members for each new state, it appeared the more stable of the two bodies of

the national legislature; its power to approve treaties and confirm executive

and judicial appointments became more significant. The House developed

clumsily. The addition of new delegations and shifts of Population within the

country meant abrupt changes in the distribution of power. (Whereas New England

had 26 percent of the House seats in the First Congress and 13 percent of them

in 1840, today it has barely 6 percent. California alone now has nearly 10

percent, 43 of the 435 seats in the House.) The frontier ethic seemed to

prevail in what was increasingly known as the "lower body." House committee

hearings were occasionally the scene of brawls, and members did not hesitate to

wander into the House chamber when they were inebriated--a practice that is

sometimes reenacted even now.<p>



<p>



The House became notorious in this century as a gerontocracy, a place where

nothing mattered so much as length of service and obedience to unwritten rules

of behavior. "If you want to get along, go along" was the motto of Sam Rayburn,

the crusty Texas Democrat who was speaker between 1940 and 1961 (except for

four years when the Republicans controlled the House), a man who drank bourbon

and branch water and smoked stogies and was married to the House. New members

were expected to be quiet and respectful of their elders. As Rayburn often

said, "Anyone could be elected once by accident. Beginning with the second

term, it's worth paying attention." Only after being re-elected were the chosen

representatives of the people permitted to start their long hard climb and to

curry favor with the mean-minded committee chairmen.<p>



<p>



Ask almost any member, and he will tell you that while glamour resides in the

Senate, expertise still lives in the House. In the average House-Senate

conference on legislation, the senators usually bring along aides who whisper

advice into their ears, while the congressmen get by on their own wits. Yet,

when the conferees emerge into the hall, the waiting newsmen and television

cameras will probably converge on a senator for an explanation of the issues,

while more knowledgeable members of the House wander off unrecognized. Such

incidents help explain why, in contrast to the practice of 150 years ago,

congressmen now want to graduate to the Senate. Senators, according to the

public perception nursed along by the press with the help of the Senate, are

the giants of the legislative branch; congressmen, by contrast, are seen as

sleazy politicians who run home most weekends to give boring speeches and who

never do anything without thinking about its impact on their next campaign. It

is enough to make anyone bitter.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The House lost much of its old pride and found new cause for bitterness and

embarrassment during the 1960s and early 1970s. It was a time of weak,

ineffectual speakers, John McCormack and Carl Albert. They were no match--even

less so than the leaders of the Senate--for an executive branch, led by Lyndon

Johnson and Richard Nixon, that was hauling away legislative discretion by the

carload. The old system had broken down, and for a time there was nothing new

to substitute.<p>



<p>



During the past few years the House has embarked on a feverish binge of reform

and self-improvement. Together with the Senate, it passed a war powers act to

curb presidential adventurism, and it launched a congressional budget process

that could lead to recovery of an authority that has steadily ebbed since the

1930s. Yet the most dramatic changes on the House side of the Capitol are

procedural ones; if Sam Rayburn could return today, he would scarcely recognize

the place.<p>



<p>



Gone are the old "teller votes," which permitted congressmen to walk down the

aisles and be counted without having their names recorded, and thereby to be on

opposite sides of the same issue in consecutive votes. On almost every matter,

however minute, there is now an electronic roll call. When the yeas and nays

are demanded and the bells signaling a roll call sounded, the lights are dimmed

and a scoreboard appears above the press gallery with the names of all 435

members. The congressmen have fifteen minutes to get to the chamber, insert

individually coded plastic cards into any of forty-four terminals, and vote by

pushing a green, red, or amber (for "present") button. Each vote is immediately

recorded on the scoreboard next to the member's name and added to a cumulative

tally that is kept on two other electronic boards at either side of the room.

Since March 15, these events and all other proceedings in the House chamber,

have been picked up by fixed-position television cameras and beamed into

certain House offices--an experiment that will probably lead to some form of

routine broadcast of legislative deliberations.<p>



<p>



(Automation, for all of its advantages, may have deprived the House of some of

its soul. As one freshman Democratic congresswoman, Barbara Mikulski of

Maryland, complains, "It makes you feel so abstractly removed from the impact

of your decisions. You don't even have to answer to your name...You could just

as easily vote to take food out of the mouth of starving people as anything

else.")<p>



<p>



Recent reforms have broken the back of the rigid seniority system. Under rules

adopted by the Democratic Caucus in 1973, for example, committee chairmen no

longer inherit their jobs and keep them indefinitely, but are generally

required to submit to a secret ballot of the caucus every two years. And most

chairmen now have less authority. The "Subcommittee Bill of Rights," also

passed in 1973, stipulates that within each committee, all of the Democratic

members negotiate and vote to assign subcommittee chairmanships and

memberships. Every committee must have written rules and establish at least

four legislative subcommittees. No congressman may chair more than one

legislative subcommittee of the House, so there are many more smaller-time

chairmen. Some arrive in their esteemed positions well ahead of the timetable.

The chairmanship of the Cotton Subcommittee of the House Agriculture Committee,

for example, used to be reserved for members with two years or more of service;

David Bowen, Democrat of Mississippi, attained it in his second term.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Certain power centers have crumbled. Democratic members of the Ways and Means

Committee no longer parcel out assignments of all other House Democrats. That

falls instead to a Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, composed of the

elected leadership, members chosen by regional caucuses, and others appointed

by the speaker. (He must be careful to see that the committee includes a

satisfactory quota of blacks, women, and newly elected congressmen.) The Rules

Committee, a collective traffic cop that sets the ground rules for floor debate

on every bill, is much weaker now, because it is named anew each Congress by

the speaker. Wayne Hays of Ohio, who turned the House Administration Committee

into his domain of personal, arbitrary power, is gone, the victim of a mistress

who talked to the press. So is Wilbur Mills of Arkansas, the longtime king of

Ways and Means, the victim of alcohol.<p>



<p>



The congressional world is no longer so private and impenetrable, immune from

outside inspection. "Our reputations are up there like dartboards, where

everybody can spit tobacco juice at them," says Majority Leader Jim Wright of

the unprecedented degree of scrutiny given Congress by the press and the

public, and even by itself. Indeed, when congressmen go off on overseas

junkets, submit inflated expense vouchers for travel home, or use their

positions to advance their own private fortunes, they are far more likely than

before to be noticed--and sometimes punished.<p>



<p>



One of the first institutions to suffer in the era of reform has been the

political party. Old-fashioned party discipline is almost nonexistent among the

Democrats, although they hold more than two thirds of the seats in the House.

Their elaborate whip system is used more to predict than to prevent losses for

the majority. "When they call," says one young member, "they almost never

suggest how I should vote, let alone apply any pressure. They just want to know

what I'm planning to do." Old coalitions and traditional obligations are no

longer reliable, as organized labor learned last spring, when many people it

had helped elect voted against its number-one priority legislation, a bill to

permit a single striking union to shut down an entire construction site.<p>



<p>



In place of strong parties and committees new caucuses and subcaucuses sprout

like desert flowers. There is a Rural Caucus, a Northwest-Midwest Economic

Advancement Coalition, and a New England Caucus; a Black Caucus and a Hispanic

one; a Congressional Clearinghouse on Women's Rights and One on "the Future."

There is now even an Italian Caucus, whose chairman, Frank Annunzio of Chicago,

has been heard to say, "We don't do anything very controversial; we just get

together to eat." And a Blue Collar Caucus, organized by second-term

Congressman Edward Beard of Rhode Island, a former house painter.<p>



<p>



The oldest, and probably most influential, is the Democratic Study Group,

which, since the late 1950s, has attempted to push Democratic leaders in a more

liberal direction. The most successful bipartisan endeavor is the Environmental

Study Conference, which publishes its own newsletter to keep congressmen and

senators informed on environmental issues. Being in the House pays rather well

now, $57,500 a year, and brings with it an array of perquisites. The average

congressman's basic upkeep costs the tax-payer about $365,000 a year, and the

annual bill for operation of the entire Congress, including the Senate and

support facilities like the Library of Congress and the Government Printing

Office, is over a billion dollars. At the same time, the House--dragging the

Senate along behind it, kicking and screaming--has adopted a tough new code of

ethics, limiting a member's outside earned income (as distinct from dividends

and royalties) to 15 percent of his congressional salary, expanding the

financial disclosure requirements, and banning office slush funds.<p>



<p>



The congressman's control over his last private domain, his personal office

staff, is now threatened, too. Some members urge that the same

antidiscrimination rules written into most federal programs be applied to

Congress.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The arrival in the House of such a large band of young rebels and doubters in

1975 accentuated the changes in the institution. For one thing, the freshmen

elected after Nixon's resignation were "new politicians" who represented a

cultural shock to their elders. They went home to their districts at least

every other weekend, like most members, but when they got there, they tended to

climb into vans they called "mobile district offices." As they toured the

countryside, they took their constituents' blood pressure and asked their

advice. At the same time, the "Class of '74" acted and talked as if they were

themselves largely responsible for the spirit of reform in the House (although

some of the changes had been urged years earlier by the Democratic Study Group

and were well under way before the 1974 election). They seemed to feel as if

they had an exclusive mandate to help the House find its new destiny. Listen to

Timothy Wirth, a Democrat elected from a Republican district in Colorado,

describing their role: "Our perceptions of what is going on in the country are

different [from those of other generations in Congress]. JFK was our first

vote, and we went through Vietnam. The others came of age during World War II

and revered Ike. We are accustomed to television....We're part of the

supermarket age, the quick fix [of social problems], and the fast shot. Our

guys understand all that....In a way, we're like Jimmy Carter. We are

improbable members of Congress, just as he's an improbable President."<p>



<p>



These Democratic "sophomores," as they are now known (all but two were

re-elected in 1976), do stand out like a cadre of provocateurs. Among them are

an unusual number of young antipoliticians--people with doctorates instead of

the usual law degrees, clergymen, and teachers. Most were profoundly affected

by the American involvement in Vietnam and the dissent and cynicism surrounding

it. Many come from marginal districts, and they owe much of their success to

the denouement of the Watergate scandals and the disgrace of the Republican

party. They wanted early notice and larger-than-customary pieces of the action.

"It was clear from the start that we didn't just want to be backbenchers," says

Norman Mineta of California, one of the organizers of the class, who is already

being mentioned as a possible candidate, someday, for speaker.<p>



<p>



From the start, the Class of '74 established its own whip system to rival that

of the leadership. Violating the old protocol, members of the class challenged

their committee chairmen, sometimes pushing their own amendments into

legislation. The class issued position papers and, when dissatisfied with what

the established Democratic powers had to say on major issues, some new members

drew up their own proposals; in the last months of the 1976 session, they even

offered their own bold suggestions for revised House ethical standards. They

became a great irritant--even a threat--both to traditionalists and to more

senior reformers. "They act as if they invented social activism," mutters one

older member.<p>



<p>



The class's ideological unity withered in 1976 (Their ratings by the Americans

for Democratic Action, the standard index of congressional liberalism, dropped

during their second year in Washington, as they contemplated a return

engagement before the voters in their marginal districts.) Nonetheless, they

stayed together as a militant force on procedural and ethical issues, and this

year they decided to keep their class unit intact as a formal organization,

even to the point of hiring staff to work for them. When Carter met with the

senior Democratic leaders of both houses in Georgia shortly after the election

last November, a committee of the sophomores demanded and obtained their own

simultaneous session with the President elect's political staff. They wanted to

make clear to Carter, as one participant later said, that "you can't just pick

up the phone anymore and call seven important people on the Hill to arrange

things."<p>



<p>



After still another forty-seven new Democrats were elected to the House for the

first time last fall, the sophomores went out of their way to arrange seminars

and orientation for the arriving freshmen. They urged the Class of '76 to

follow their example by asserting themselves, though this year's freshmen

resisted and went their own way. Their class had more veterans of state

legislatures, local government, and the established political organizations;

they needed less in the way of baptism. Ask anyone in the House leadership in

an unguarded moment, and he will probably say that with all due respect to the

dedicated sophomores, the new freshmen are "more mature."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The results of the ferment and reform are, by any definition, mixed. The

majority leader, Jim Wright of Texas--a persuasive man who looks as if he were

bred for his bushy, multicolored eyebrows--speaks with passion about the

improvements. Today's House, insists Wright, as he gazes up at the enormous

crystal chandelier in his office near the chamber, "is a far more responsive

institution. It is addressing the big problems...biting the unpalatable

bullets...screwing up its courage." Equally enthusiastic is David Obey, a

scholarly, laconic congressman from Wisconsin, who, when he first came to

Washington eight years ago, probably would not have agreed with Wright about

much beyond the weather. Now thirty-eight, chairman of the Commission on

Administrative Review, and a member of a new elite--the reform

establishment--Obey says that recent changes have made the House "a more

pleasant place to work, far more accountable....We are close now to an ideal

balance between seniority, strong leadership, and a dispersion of the

interesting things to do."<p>



<p>



But what of the revamped committee system? Unaccountable tyrants have been

replaced as committee chairmen with slightly less senior members who are

well-intentioned but ineffective, and in some cases embarrassingly incompetent.

On the whole, the lineup is not encouraging. Harold "Bizz" Johnson of

California, now in charge of Public Works, has been known to read the same

paragraph over and over again when giving public speeches. Robert N. C. Nix of

Pennsylvania, who sleeps through many meetings of the Post Office and Civil

Service Committee, was vulnerable to the reformers last time around, but his

chairmanship was spared when his colleagues from the Black Caucus Intervened on

his behalf. Clement Zablocki of Wisconsin, a strident but inarticulate

anticommunist of the old school, has failed to make the International Relations

Committee a meaningful force. Carl Perkins of Kentucky is readily manipulated

by more forceful members of the Education and Labor Committee. Illness has

prevented Melvin Price of Illinois, the latest chairman of the Armed Services

Committee, from performing his duties. Harley Staggers of West Virginia,

chairman of Interstate and Foreign Commerce, had his last hurrah when he tried

unsuccessfully to have the CBS television network held in contempt for refusing

to turn over unused film from a documentary about the Pentagon; he has since

been stripped of control over his own investigations subcommittee.<p>



<p>



John Flynt of Georgia has used the resources of the Committee on Standards of

Official Conduct on trivial investigations rather than on such issues as

conflicts of interest or illegal campaign contributions. James J. Delaney of

New York, at seventy-six, is the youngest chairman of the Rules Committee in

years. He does not whistle or hum his way through committee sessions as did his

predecessor, Ray Madden of Indiana; but Delaney is out of touch with the

current legislative agenda and most of his discretion has been surrendered to

the speaker. Henry Gonzalez of Texas, in a recent orgy of public dispute with

Chief Counsel Richard Sprague of the Select Committee to Investigate the

Kennedy and King Assassinations, made a spectacle of himself and the House.

(Gonzalez called Sprague a "rattlesnake" and a "scoundrel." In the end, both

Gonzalez and Sprague resigned.)<p>



<p>



This is the heyday of the subcommittees, but they have been used more to

promote the ambitions and inflate the egos of young and mid-career congressmen

than to help the House organize its business in a rational manner. Often the

chairmen are so fresh and inexperienced in their areas of alleged expertise

that they fall easy prey to agency heads and sub-Cabinet chiefs in the

executive branch. Certain committees juggle subcommittee jurisdictions and

memberships so whimsically that the result is mass confusion. After this year's

redistribution of tasks on the Public Works Committee, some members are still

not clear which areas of energy policy are their concern. That is why, when

Carter issued his energy program in April, a special ad hoc committee had to be

created just to parcel out pieces of the package to the appropriate

subcommittees.<p>



<p>



Organizational reform collides with a constant fact of life: the average

congressman is confronted with a staggering decision overload. On a single day

last spring, the House had to decide whether to provide continuing

appropriations for fiscal year 1977 for the federal revenue-sharing program;

whether to fund a program to relieve youth unemployment for fiscal year 1978;

whether to provide for inspection by the Department of Agriculture of

domesticated rabbits slaughtered for human food; whether to restrict the

leasing of farms with flue-cured tobacco marketing quotas; and whether to

approve President Carter's government reorganization plan. Obviously, even with

staff help, no member can be well-informed on all of these and the thousands of

other matters that come before him every year.<p>



<p>



In practical political terms, this may not make any difference anyway, because

most congressmen are judged not on the basis of their stand on issues but on

how well they perform as ombudsmen and interveners between the people and their

complex government. David Stockman, an earnest thirty-year-old Republican from

Benton Harbor, Michigan, who was elected to Congress from a safe district last

November, has already made his adjustment to that elemental truth. During his

first several months in office, he solved a number of problems for people at

home--getting fuel oil allocation quotas revised so that a jobber would have

enough to keep his customers happy and stay in business through the winter;

having money restored for a senior citizens program; intervening with other

agencies to correct petty injustices. Stockman does not happen to believe that

he should be spending so much of his time and resources on such "tertiary

problems." But that is the system, and he will participate as readily as the

next congressman. "They [the people affected by his interventions with the

executive branch] will probably be willing to vote for me forever, regardless

of what my position is on the B-1 bomber or the Cruise missile," he says.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Presiding over the new House is a walking, talking symbol of the old, Speaker

Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. of Massachusetts.<p>



<p>



Tip O'Neill came to Congress in 1952 as the successor to John F. Kennedy (who

was then moving on to the Senate) in a district that covers working class

neighborhoods in Boston, the adjoining city of Cambridge, and wealthy suburbs.

Although his district includes Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute

of Technology, and Boston University, O'Neill wouldn't be mistaken for an

academic. He is a classic Boston Irish politician, a large, lumbering man who

is more at home and considerably more effective with storytelling and political

horse trading than with position papers and policy debate. He was early to

oppose the Vietnam War, early to recognize--and encourage--the strong sentiment

for Nixon's impeachment, and early to support procedural reform; he is also a

charter member of the House Democratic establishment, which constitutes a

shrinking percentage of the caucus.<p>



<p>



He acquired real power for the first time in 1971, when he was named majority

whip in return for influential support of the candidacy of another old-timer,

Hale Boggs of Louisiana, for majority leader. He might never have moved up the

leadership escalator to become speaker (as he did this year on Albert's

retirement), were it not for the disappearance of Boggs in an Alaskan plane

crash in 1972. There is irony in O'Neill's current position. He took over in

January at a moment when the speakership was being infused with new power and

authority by the reform movement, as an alternative to the committee chairmen.

Yet since he is already sixty-four, he will probably be speaker for a maximum

of two terms, four years, hardly long enough to become one of titans in the

history of the House.<p>



<p>



O'Neill basks in the frequent characterizations him as a tough, firm speaker,

the toughest since Rayburn, but one who is more concerned about and responsive

to his constituency within the House, knows how to read the trends and adapt to

them. "I'm a progressive liberal and a tough partisan," he says confidently

"The fellas know that....They know I've done my homework, and they know I know

the votes." The members also know that they can count on O'Neill for help in

rough situations, but that he may extract a price in return. This year, for

example, the speaker ran interference on the congressional pay raise of

$12,900. Recommended by a federal advisory commission, the raise would

automatically take effect unless it was voted down. O'Neill realized that many

members wanted to take the money and thought they deserved it, but that they

would feel compelled for political reasons to vote against it. He simply kept

it off the House calendar, thus winning praise behind the scenes for his

exemplary "leadership." When pressed by some members who really did want a vote

on the pay raise, he would shake his head and reply with mock sincerity, "You

know, the power of the speaker isn't what it used to be." But then came

O'Neill's price: adoption of a stringent ethics code proposed by Obey's

commission, including provisions that some congressmen considered to be

draconian limitations on outside income. When a few members of the Rules

Committee began to balk publicly, he invited the entire group to a private

breakfast in his office. They talked of their plans to give the ethics measure

an "open rule," which would permit amendments and revision--and certain

weakening--on the House floor. O'Neill gave them time to let off steam, one by

one, and then he returned the favor, twitting each member in turn. "I carried

the ball on the pay raise," he said, and you're not going to double-cross me

now." They didn't. He threatened, in fact, that any member who did resist would

find himself in the next Congress on the District of Columbia Committee, a

low-prestige assignment. So the Rules Committee decided, as one member put it,

to "swallow the whole watermelon," unanimously approving the ethics package and

sending it to the floor without provision for amendment.<p>



<p>



The Speaker is also one of the House's most inveterate junketeers, known for

leading annual bipartisan swings around the world when Congress is out of

session, trips with not even an ostensible purpose. On one trip, O'Neill's

group traveled by Air Force jet to Israel, Greece, Spain, and Egypt, where it

spent $1500 for a banquet at the Cairo Sheraton and another $4000 of taxpayers'

money for a tour of the pyramids, lunch in Luxor, and a grand dinner on a barge

in the Nile. The Speaker embarrassed the younger Democrats when he spoke up

this year for the right of Robert L. F. Sikes of Florida to retain his

chairmanship of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction even

though Sikes has been reprimanded by the House for conflict of interest and

inadequate disclosure in his annual financial statement. (The caucus disagreed

with O'Neill and voted overwhelmingly to strip Sikes of the job.)<p>



<p>



A good sport, O'Neill knows how to exchange jokes with the reporters who cover

his daily briefing in the speaker's office before the House goes into session.

But at those meetings and in other public appearances, O'Neill's age and his

slowing pace are painfully obvious. His white-going-yellow hair droops forward,

and his ample chin separates from the bones in his face. When the House and

Senate convene in the House chamber for a presidential or other address to a

joint session of Congress, O'Neill has been seen to doze off under the hot

television lights and slump before the cameras, while Vice President Walter

Mondale sits alert at his side.<p>



<p>



O'Neill's clashes with the aggressive sophomores are the stuff of growing

legends. He has welcomed delegations from that class, converging on his office

to confront him on some issue, with the question, "What do you sons-of-bitches

want now?" As Thomas Foley of Washington, the new chairman of the Democratic

Caucus, puts it, both sides in the struggle must recognize their differences as

more of a cultural clash than a genuine policy dispute. "These people have to

realize," says Foley, "that Tip's not going to grow a beard, come to work on a

bicycle, or go backpacking with them in the Adirondacks. He's going to smoke

cigars, not pot."<p>



<p>



Because no other member of the Democratic leadership is an alternative or a

challenger to his authority O'Neill is in a strong position. Jim Wright is one

of the last great spellbinding orators in the House and cuts a much more

stylish, modern figure than O'Neill. But Wright grew up in the conservative

bloc of House Democrats and is still identified with the old pork barrel

tradition of the Public Works Committee. Furthermore, he won his job by only

one vote over Philip Burton of California, an abrasive power-broker who has

stepped on every one of O'Neill's toes at some point in the last few years.

Wright did not help his prospects by keeping his wife on the Public Works

Committee payroll for years and by his careless (though not illegal)

intermingling of leftover campaign money with his personal finances. John

Brademas of Indiana, the new majority whip, is a compelling speaker and a

hail-fellow-well-met, yet he is perceived as the darling of the ADA, the

liberal's liberal, an articulate spokesman for Great Society spending programs

that are increasingly coming into question. Foley is a protege of O'Neill's,

and could be taken for a younger, trimmer version of the Speaker. But he does

not seem eager to build his stewardship of the Democratic Caucus into a

policy-making position.<p>



<p>



The Republicans do not offer much of an alternative in the House. Their number

has dwindled to 144. Their leader is John Rhodes of Arizona, a stocky stolid,

colorless figure who initiates few policy proposals. Rhodes and O'Neill enjoy a

notable disdain for each other. Last year the minority leader published a book,

The Futile System, in which he lambasted O'Neill for unrelenting partisanship

and gave vent to the minority's frustrations over its inability to influence

legislation in the House in any but a nay-saying way. With the more than twenty

scandals that have hit House Democrats--especially the ongoing investigation of

influence-peddling by South Korea--the Republicans should be in a strong

position to portray themselves as a clean-government option. But they have

other problems to worry over, including bitter dissent within their own sparse

ranks. Their right wing is growing in size and influence, thereby crippling the

prospects of moderates like John Anderson of Illinois, chairman of the House

Republican Conference. (There is even talk by some Republicans of switching to

the Democratic party before the next Section.) Anderson is regarded as one of

the most able and articulate members of Congress, but he has a voting record

that is anathema to most other congressmen in his party. Some colleagues

interpret his having gone along on some of O'Neill's aimless junkets as

evidence that he has given up trying to be an effective force, and there are

rumors that he will retire. Rhodes, a conservative himself, is content to sit

back and let the contending forces within the GOP contingent battle it out.

More liberal Republicans do not challenge him, for fear they will end up with a

leader who is further to the right.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Beyond all of its own internal problems, the House--and for that matter, the

Senate--must cope anew with the executive branch, in this case the Carter White

House, which is highly skilled at public relations. To be sure, the new

President and his assistant for legislative liaison, Frank Moore, made a number

of serious mistakes in their initial dealings with Capitol Hill, but in the

long run they are bound to prevail over a more amorphous and ill-organized

institution like Congress.<p>



<p>



If congressmen are disappointed by the lack of deference paid them from the

other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, they should know that the worst is yet to

come. Carter does not happen to believe the mythology, still so popular on the

House side of the Capitol, that because they are never more than two years away

from the last or the next election, congressmen are closer to the people than

anyone else in the American political system. Having waged a successful

anti-Washington campaign, the President feels that the designation of people's

spokesman belongs more justifiably to him than to Congress. He thinks that he

has a better sense than congressmen or senators of the current attitudes and

desires of the average citizen. "Jimmy probably has less regard for the

opinions of the speaker of the House than those of the chairman of the National

Governors Conference," says one political aide to the President. "This may come

as a blow to them on the Hill; but remember, having been a governor, he relates

to them much better than to congressmen who have spent all this time in

Washington." On several early occasions, including a fight last spring over the

defense budget, the Carter Administration showed its disregard for the

established Democratic congressional leadership by dealing directly with other

congressmen with whom the White House agreed on budget questions. Such tactics

infuriated O'Neill and other House leaders, who were purporting to speak for

the President on the same issues. If Carter identifies with any element on

Capitol Hill, it is probably the persistently bothersome House sophomores, who

share his distrust for the way things have been.<p>



<p>



To keep the President's advantage clear when the standoff with Congress becomes

tough, Carter's political operatives are building his own rival power base.

Without fanfare, the Democratic National Committee is planning to use local

Carter supporters across the country to create support for such controversial

programs as the energy-conservation tax plan. Senators with statewide

constituencies, may be able to weather the storm, but House members, with an

average 460,000 constituents concentrated in a small geographic area, may prove

to be particularly vulnerable to such a strategy, especially during the

election year of 1978. They may have even worse problems of image and

organization ahead of them.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Today the House is not the grand depository of the democratic principles of the

nation. It not a calm, deliberate council of wise men and women, nor even a

forum where the passions and needs of the people are reliably dealt with. It is

at best a collection of well-intentioned people who have fallen back on a

service role while making a great deal of noise about larger issues. Most

federal programs originate in the executive branch, are developed and revised

there or in the independent agencies, and then are interpreted and adapted by

the courts. The House is fortunate when it has a chance to make a few changes

and suggestions along the way.<p>



<p>



Except for the pay and the perquisites, the role of the congressman is simply

not as important as the Constitution and some congressmen would have the public

believe. As John Anderson says, "The psychic income of the job is far less than

it once was."<p>



<p>



Some, including Anderson, insist that the House is not even trying

anymore--that if it ever did, it is no longer speaking with a clear voice on

matters of national policy. As he says, "The House less and less addresses

itself to the great issues of policy. Everybody's got a little subcommittee,

and everything is terribly fragmented. We've become a body of tinkerers."

	<font size=5>J</font>OHN Hildebrand who has lived in the Artesian Valley, near Fowler, Kansas, 

since he was two years old, remembers why the valley has the name it does. 

"There were hundreds of natural springs in this valley. If you drilled a 

well for your house, the natural water pressure was enough to go through 

your hot-water system and out the shower head." There were marshes in 

Fowler in the 1920s, where cattle sank to their bellies in mud. And the 

early settlers went boating down Crooked Creek, in the shade of the 

cottonwoods, as far as Meade, twelve miles away.<P>

Today the creek is dry, the bogs and the springs have gone, and the 

inhabitants of Fowler must dig deeper and deeper wells to bring up water. 

The reason is plain enough: seen from the air, the surrounding land is 

pockmarked with giant discs of green--quarter-section pivot-irrigation 

systems water rich crops of corn, steadily depleting the underlying 

aquifer. Everybody in Fowler knows what is happening, but it is in 

nobody's interest to cut down his own consumption of water. That would 

just leave more for somebody else.<P>

Five thousand miles to the east, near the Spanish city of Valencia, the 

waters of the River Turia are shared by some 15,000 farmers in an 

arrangement that dates back at least 550 years and probably longer. Each 

farmer, when his turn comes, takes as much water as he needs from the 

distributory canal and wastes none. He is discouraged from cheating--

watering out of turn--merely by the watchful eyes of his neighbors above 

and below him on the canal. If they have a grievance, they can take it to 

the Tribunal de las Aguas, which meets on Thursday mornings outside the 

Apostles' door of the Cathedral of Valencia. Records dating back to the 

1400s suggest that cheating is rare. The huerta of Valencia is a 

profitable region, growing at least two crops a year.<P>

Two irrigation systems: one sustainable, equitable, and long-lived, the 

other a doomed free-for-all. Two case histories cited by political 

scientists who struggle to understand the persistent human failure to 

solve "common-pool resource problems." Two models for how the planet Earth 

might be managed in an age of global warming. The atmosphere is just like 

the aquifer beneath Fowler or the waters of the Turia: limited and shared. 

The only way we can be sure not to abuse it is by self

restraint. And yet nobody knows how best to persuade the human race to 

exercise self-restraint.<P>

At the center of all environmentalism lies a problem: whether to appeal to 

the heart or to the head--whether to urge people to make sacrifices in 

behalf of the planet or to accept that they will not, and instead rig the 

economic choices so that they find it rational to be environmentalist. It 

is a problem that most activists in the environmental movement barely 

pause to recognize. Good environmental practice is compatible with growth, 

they insist, so it is rational as well as moral. Yet if this were so, good 

environmental practice would pay for itself, and there would be no need to 

pass laws to deter polluters or regulate emissions. A country or a firm 

that cut corners on pollution control would have no cost advantage over 

its rivals.<P>

Those who do recognize this problem often conclude that their appeals 

should not be made to self-interest but rather should be couched in terms 

of sacrifice, selflessness, or, increasingly, moral shame.<P>

We believe they are wrong. Our evidence comes from a surprising 

convergence of ideas in two disciplines that are normally on very 

different tracks: economics and biology. It is a convergence of which most 

economists and biologists are still ignorant, but a few have begun to 

notice. "I can talk to evolutionary biologists," says Paul Romer, an 

economist at the University of California at Berkeley and the Canadian 

Institute for Advanced Research, in Toronto, "because, like me, they think 

individuals are important. Sociologists still talk more of the action of 

classes rather than individuals." Gary Becker, who won the Nobel Prize in 

economics last year, has been reading biological treatises for years; Paul 

Samuelson, who won it more than twenty years ago, has published several 

papers recently applying economic principles to biological problems. And 

biologists such as John Maynard Smith and William Hamilton have been 

raiding economics for an equally long time. Not that all economists and 

biologists agree--that would be impossible. But there are emerging 

orthodoxies in both disciplines that are strikingly parallel.<P>

The last time that biology and economics were engaged was in the Social 

Darwinism of Herbert Spencer and Francis Galton. The precedent is not 

encouraging. The economists used the biologists' idea of survival of the 

fittest to justify everything from inequalities of wealth to racism and 

eugenics. So most academics are likely to be rightly wary of what comes 

from the new entente. But they need not fear. This obsession is not with 

struggle but with cooperation.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>FOR THE GOOD OF THE WORLD?</B><P>



<font size=5>B</font>IOLOGISTS and economists agree that cooperation cannot be taken for 

granted. People and animals will cooperate only if they as individuals are 

given reasons to do so. For economists that means economic incentives; for 

biologists it means the pursuit of short-term goals that were once the 

means to reproduction. Both think that people are generally not willing to 

pay for the long-term good of society or the planet. To save the 

environment, therefore, we will have to find a way to reward individuals 

for good behavior and punish them for bad. Exhorting them to self

sacrifice for the sake of "humanity" or "the earth" will not be enough.<P>

This is utterly at odds with conventional wisdom. "Building an 

environmentally sustainable future depends on restructuring the global 

economy, major shifts in human reproductive behavior, and dramatic changes 

in values and lifestyles," wrote Lester Brown, of the Worldwatch 

Institute, in his State of the World for 1992, typifying the way 

environmentalists see economics. If people are shortsighted, an alien 

value system, not human nature, is to blame.<P>

Consider the environmental summit at Rio de Janeiro last year. Behind its 

debates and agreements lay two entirely unexamined assumptions: that 

governments could deliver their peoples, and that the problem was getting 

people to see the global forest beyond their local trees. In other words, 

politicians and lobbyists assume that a combination of international 

treaties and better information can save the world. Many biologists and 

economists meanwhile assert that even a fully informed public, whose 

governments have agreed on all sorts of treaties, will still head blindly 

for the cliff of oblivion.<P>

Three decades ago there was little dissonance between academic thinking 

and the environmentalists' faith in the collective good. Biologists 

frequently explained animal behavior in terms of the "good of the 

species," and some economists were happy to believe in the Great Society, 

prepared to pay according to its means for the sake of the general welfare 

of the less fortunate. But both disciplines have undergone radical 

reformations since then. Evolutionary biology has been transformed by the 

"selfish gene" notion, popularized by Richard Dawkins, of Oxford 

University, which essentially asserts that animals, including man, act 

altruistically only when it brings some benefit to copies of their own 

genes. This happens under two circumstances: when the altruist and the 

beneficiary are close relatives, such as bees in a hive, and when the 

altruist is in a position to have the favor returned at a later date. This 

new view holds that there simply are no cases of cooperation in the animal 

kingdom except these. It took root with an eye-opening book called 

Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966), by George Williams, a professor 

of biological sciences at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. 

Williams's message was that evolution pits individuals against each other 

far more than it pits species or groups against each other.<P>

By coincidence (Williams says he was unaware of economic theory at the 

time), the year before had seen the publication of a book that was to have 

a similar impact on economics. Mancur Olson's Logic of Collective Action 

set out to challenge the notion that individuals would try to further 

their collective interest rather than their short-term individual 

interests. Since then economics has hewed ever more closely to the idea 

that societies are sums of their individuals, each acting in rational self

interest, and policies that assume otherwise are doomed. This is why it is 

so hard to make a communist ideal work, or even to get the American 

electorate to vote for any of the sacrifices necessary to achieve deficit 

reduction.<P>

And yet the environmental lobby posits a view of the human species in 

which individual self-interest is not the mainspring of human conduct. It 

proposes policies that assume that when properly informed of the long

term collective consequences of their actions, people will accept the need 

for rules that impose restraint. One of the two philosophies must be 

wrong. Which?<P>

We are going to argue that the environmental movement has set itself an 

unnecessary obstacle by largely ignoring the fact that human beings are 

motivated by self-interest rather than collective interests. But that does 

not mean that the collective interest is unobtainable: examples from 

biology and economics show that there are all sorts of ways to make the 

individual interest concordant with the collective--so long as we 

recognize the need to.<P>

The environmentalists are otherwise in danger of making the same mistakes 

that Marxists made, but our point is not political. For some reason it is 

thought conservative to believe that human nature is inherently incapable 

of ignoring individual incentives for the greater good, and liberal to 

believe the opposite. But in practice liberals often believe just as 

strongly as conservatives in individual incentives that are not monetary. 

The threat of prison, or even corporate shame, can be incentives to 

polluters. The real divide comes between those who believe it is necessary 

to impose such incentives, and those who hope to persuade merely by force 

of argument.<P>

Wherever environmentalism has succeeded, it has done so by changing 

individual incentives, not by exhortation, moral reprimand, or appeals to 

our better natures. If somebody wants to dump a toxic chemical or smuggle 

an endangered species, it is the thought of prison or a fine that deters 

him. If a state wants to avoid enforcing the federal Clean Air Act of 

1990, it is the thought of eventually being "bumped up" to a more 

stringent nonattainment category of the act that haunts state officials. 

Given that this is the case, environmental policy should be a matter of 

seeking the most enforceable, least bureaucratic, cheapest, most effective 

incentives. Why should these always be sanctions? Why not some prizes, 

too? Nations, states, local jurisdictions, and even firms could contribute 

to financial rewards for the "greenest" of their fellow bodies.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>PLAYING GAMES WITH LIFE</B><P>



<font size=5>T</font>HE new convergence of biology and economics has been helped by a common 

methodology--game theory. John Maynard Smith, a professor of biology at 

the University of Sussex, in Britain, was the first effectively to apply 

the economist's habit of playing a "game" with competing strategies to 

evolutionary enigmas, the only difference being that the economic games 

reward winners with money while evolutionary games reward winners with the 

chance to survive and breed. One game in particular has proved especially 

informative in both disciplines: the prisoner's dilemma.<P>

A dramatized version of the game runs as follows: Two guilty accomplices 

are held in separate cells and interrogated by the police. Each is faced 

with a dilemma. If they both confess (or "defect"), they will both go to 

jail for three years. If they both stay silent (or "cooperate"), they will 

both go to jail for a year on a lesser charge that the police can prove. 

But if one confesses and the other does not, the defector will walk free 

on a plea bargain, while the cooperator, who stayed silent, will get a 

five-year sentence.<P>

Assuming that they have not discussed the dilemma before they were 

arrested, can each trust his accomplice to stay silent? If not, he should 

defect and reduce his sentence from five to three years. But even if he 

can rely on his partner to cooperate, he is still better off if he 

defects, because that reduces his sentence from three years to none at 

all. So each will reason that the right thing to do is to defect, which 

results in three years for each of them. In the language of game 

theorists, individually rational strategies result in a collectively 

irrational outcome.<P>

Biologists were interested in the prisoner's dilemma as a model for the 

evolution of cooperation. Under what conditions, they wanted to know, 

would it pay an animal to evolve a strategy based on cooperation rather 

than defection? They discovered that the bleak message of the prisoner's 

dilemma need not obtain if the game is only one in a long series--played 

by students, researchers, or computers, for points rather than years in 

jail. Under these circumstances the best strategy is to cooperate on the 

first trial and then do whatever the other guy did last time. This 

strategy became known as tit-for-tat. The threat of retaliation makes 

defection much less likely to pay. Robert Axelrod, a political scientist, 

and William Hamilton, a biologist, both at the University of Michigan, 

discovered by public tournament that there seems to be no strategy that 

beats tit-for

tat. Tit-for-two-tats--that is, cooperate even if the other defects once, 

but not if he defects twice--comes close to beating it, but of hundreds of 

strategies that have been tried, none works better. Field biologists have 

been finding tit-for-tat at work throughout the animal kingdom ever since. 

A female vampire bat, for example, will regurgitate blood for another, 

unrelated, female bat that has failed to find a meal during the night--but 

not if the donee has refused to be similarly generous in the past.<P>

Such cases have contributed to a growing conviction among biologists that 

reciprocity is the basis of social life in animals like primates and 

dolphins, too. Male dolphins call in their debts when collecting allies to 

help them abduct females from other groups. Baboons and chimpanzees 

remember past favors when coming to one another's aid in fights. And human 

beings? Kim Hill and Hillard Kaplan, of the University of New Mexico, have 

discovered that among the Ache people of Paraguay, successful hunters 

share spare meat with those who have helped them in the past or might help 

them in the future.<P>

The implication of these studies is that where cooperation among 

individuals does evolve, surmounting the prisoner's dilemma, it does so 

through tit-for-tat. A cautious exchange of favors enables trust to be 

built upon a scaffolding of individual reward. The conclusion of biology, 

in other words, is a hopeful one. Cooperation can emerge naturally. The 

collective interest can be served by the pursuit of selfish interests.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>THE TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS</B><P>



<font size=5>E</font>CONOMISTS are interested in the prisoner's dilemma as a paradoxical case 

in which individually rational behavior leads to collectively irrational 

results--both accomplices spend three years in jail when they could have 

spent only one. This makes it a model of a "commons" problem, the 

archetype of which is the history of medieval English common land. In 1968 

the ecologist Garrett Hardin wrote an article in Science magazine that 

explained "the tragedy of the commons"--why common land tended to suffer 

from overgrazing, and why every sea fishery suffers from overfishing. It 

is because the benefits that each extra cow (or netful of fish) brings are 

reaped by its owner, but the costs of the extra strain it puts on the 

grass (or on fish stocks) are shared among all the users of what is held 

in common. In economic jargon, the costs are externalized. Individually 

rational behavior deteriorates into collective ruin.<P>

The ozone hole and the greenhouse effect are classic tragedies of the 

commons in the making: each time you burn a gallon of gas to drive into 

town, you reap the benefit of it, but the environmental cost is shared 

with all five billion other members of the human race. You are a "free 

rider." Being rational, you drive, and the atmosphere's capacity to absorb 

carbon dioxide is "overgrazed," and the globe warms. Even if individuals 

will benefit in the long run from the prevention of global warming, in the 

short run such prevention will cost them dear. As Michael McGinnis and 

Elinor Ostrom, of Indiana University at Bloomington, put it in a recent 

paper, global warming is a "classic dilemma of collective action: a large 

group of potential beneficiaries facing diffuse and uncertain gains is 

much harder to organize for collective action than clearly defined groups 

who are being asked to suffer easily understandable costs."<P>

Hardin recognized two ways to avoid overexploiting commons. One is to 

privatize them, so that the owner has both costs and benefits. Now he has 

every incentive not to overgraze. The other is to regulate them by having 

an outside agency with the force of law behind it--a government, in short

-restrict the number of cattle.<P>

At the time Hardin published his article, the latter solution was very 

popular. Governments throughout the world reacted to the mere existence of 

a commons problem by grabbing powers of regulation. Most egregiously, in 

the Indian subcontinent communally exploited forests and grasslands were 

nationalized and put under the charge of centralized bureaucracies far 

away. This might have worked if governments were competent and 

incorruptible, and had bottomless resources to police their charges. But 

it made problems worse, because the forest was no longer the possession of 

the local village even collectively. So the grazing, poaching, and logging 

intensified--the cost had been externalized not just to the rest of the 

village but to the entire country.<P>

The whole structure of pollution regulation in the United States 

represents a centralized solution to a commons problem. Bureaucrats 

decide, in response to pressure from lobbyists, exactly what levels of 

pollution to allow, usually give no credit for any reductions below the 

threshold, and even specify the technologies to be used (the so-called 

"best available technology" policy). This creates perverse incentives for 

polluters, because it makes pollution free up to the threshold, and so 

there is no encouragement to reduce pollution further. Howard Klee, the 

director of regulatory affairs at Amoco Corporation, gives a dramatic 

account of how topsy-turvy this world of "command and control" can become. 

"If your company does voluntary control of pollution rather than waiting 

for regulation, it is punished by putting itself at a comparative 

disadvantage. The guy who does nothing until forced to by law is 

rewarded." Amoco and the Environmental Protection Agency did a thorough 

study of one refinery in Yorktown, Virginia, to discover what pollutants 

came out from it and how dangerous each was. Their conclusion was 

startling. Some of the things that Amoco and other refiners were required 

to do by EPA regulations were less effective than alternatives; meanwhile, 

pollution from many sources that government does not regulate could have 

been decreased. The study group concluded that for one fourth of the 

amount that it currently spends on pollution control, Amoco could achieve 

the same effect in protection of health and the environment--just by 

spending money where it made a difference, rather than where government 

dictated.<P>

A more general way, favored by free-market economists, of putting the same 

point is that regulatory regimes set the value of cleanliness at zero: if 

a company wishes to produce any pollutant, at present it can do so free, 

as long as it produces less than the legal limit. If, instead, it had to 

buy a quota from the government, it would have an incentive to drive 

emissions as low as possible to keep costs down, and the government would 

have a source of revenue to spend on environmental protection. The 1990 

Clean Air Act set up a market in tradable pollution permits for 

sulfur-dioxide emissions, which is a form of privatization.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>THE PITFALLS OF PRIVATIZATION</B><P>



<font size=5>B</font>ECAUSE privatizing a common resource can internalize the costs of 

damaging it, economists increasingly call for privatization as the 

solution to commons problems. After all, the original commons--common 

grazing land in England--were gradually "enclosed" by thorn hedges and 

divided among private owners. Though the reasons are complex, among them 

undoubtedly was the accountability of the private landowner. As Sir 

Anthony Fitzherbert put it in The Boke of Husbandrie (1534): "And thoughe 

a man be but a farmer, and shall have his farm XX [20] yeres, it is lesse 

coste to hym, and more profyte to quyckeset [fence with thorns], dyche and 

hedge, than to have his cattell goo before the herdeman [on common land]." 

The hawthorn hedge did for England what barbed wire did for the prairies

-it privatized a common.<P>

It would be possible to define private property rights in clean air. Paul 

Romer, of Berkeley, points out that the atmosphere is not like the light 

from a lighthouse, freely shared by all users. One person cannot use a 

given chunk of air for seeing through--or comfortably breathing--after 

another person has filled it with pollution any more than two people in 

succession can kill the same whale. What stands in the way of privatizing 

whales or the atmosphere is that enforcement of a market would require as 

large a bureaucracy as if the whole thing had been centralized in the 

first place.<P>

The privatization route has other drawbacks. The enclosure movement itself 

sparked at least three serious rebellions against the established order by 

self-employed yeomen dispossessed when commons were divided. It would be 

much the same today. Were whale-killing rights to be auctioned to the 

highest bidder, protectors (who would want to buy rights in order to let 

them go unused) would likely be unable to match the buying power of the 

whalers. If U.S. citizens were to be sold shares in their national parks, 

those who would rather operate strip mines or charge access might be 

prepared to pay a premium for the shares, whereas those who would keep the 

parks pristine and allow visitors free access might not.<P>

Moreover, there is no guarantee that rationality would call for a private 

owner of an environmental public good to preserve it or use it 

sustainably. Twenty years ago Colin Clark, a mathematician at the 

University of British Columbia, wrote an article in Science pointing out 

that under certain circumstances it might make economic sense to 

exterminate whales. What he meant was that because interest rates could 

allow money to grow faster than whales reproduce, even somebody who had a 

certain monopoly over the world's whales and could therefore forget about 

free riders should not, for reasons of economic self-interest, take a 

sustainable yield of the animals. It would be more profitable to kill them 

all, bank the proceeds, sell the equipment, and live off the interest.<P>

So until recently the economists had emerged from their study of the 

prisoner's dilemma more pessimistic than the biologists. Cooperation, they 

concluded, could not be imposed by a central bureaucracy, nor would it 

emerge from the allocation of private property rights. The destructive 

free-for-all of Fowler, Kansas, not the cooperative harmony of Valencia's 

huerta, was the inevitable fate of common-pool resources.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>THE MIDDLE WAY</B><P>



<font size=5>I</font>N the past few years, however, there has been a glint of hope amid the 

gloom. And it bears an uncanny similarity to tit-for-tat, in that it 

rewards cooperators with cooperation and punishes defectors with 

defection--a strategy animals often use. Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues 

at Indiana University have made a special study of commons problems that 

were solved, including the Valencia irrigation system, and she finds that 

the connective thread is neither privatization nor centralization. She 

believes that local people can and do get together to solve their 

difficulties, as long as the community is small, stable, and 

communicating, and has a strong concern for the future. Among the examples 

she cites is a Turkish inshore fishery at Alanya. In the 1970s the local 

fishermen fell into the usual trap of heavy fishing, conflict, and 

potential depletion. But they then developed an ingenious and complicated 

set of rules, allocating by lot each known fishing location to a licensed 

fisher in a pattern that rotates through the season. Enforcement is done 

by the fishermen themselves, though the government recognizes the system 

in law.<P>

Valencia is much the same. Individuals know each other and can quickly 

identify cheaters. Just as in tit-for-tat, because the game is played 

again and again, any cheater risks ostracism and sanction in the next 

round. So a small, stable community that interacts repeatedly can find a 

way to pursue the collective interest--by altering the individual 

calculation.<P>

"There's a presumption out there that users always overexploit a common 

resource," Ostrom says, "and therefore governments always have to step in 

and set things right. But the many cases of well-governed and -managed 

irrigation systems, fisheries, and forests show this to be an inadequate 

starting point. A faraway government could never have found the resources 

to design systems like Alanya." Ostrom is critical of the unthinking 

application of oversimplified game-theory models because, she says, 

economists and biologists alike frequently begin to believe that people 

who have depended on a given economic or biological resource for centuries 

are incapable of communicating, devising rules, and monitoring one 

another. She admits that cooperation is more likely in small groups that 

have common interests and the autonomy to create and enforce their own 

rules.<P>

Some biologists go further, and argue that even quite big groups can 

cooperate. Egbert Leigh, of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, 

points out that commons problems go deep into the genetics of animals and 

plants. To run a human body, 75,000 different genes must "agree" to 

cooperate and suppress free-riders (free-riding genes, known as outlaw 

genes, are increasingly recognized as a major force in evolution). Mostly 

they do, but why? Leigh found the answer in Adam Smith, who argued, in 

Leigh's words, that "if individuals had sufficient common interest in 

their groups good, they would combine to suppress the activities of 

members acting contrary to the group's welfare." Leigh calls this idea a 

"parliament of genes," though it is crucial to it that all members of such 

a parliament would suffer if cooperation broke down--as the members of 

real national parliaments do not when they impose local solutions.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>WHAT CHANGED DU PONT'S MIND?</B><P>



<font size=5>F</font>OR all these reasons, cooperation ought not to be a problem in Fowler, 

Kansas--a community in which everybody knows everybody else and shares the 

immediate consequences of a tragedy of the commons. Professor Kenneth Oye, 

the director of the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts 

Institute of Technology, first heard about Fowler's sinking water table 

when his wife attended a family reunion there.<P>

Oye's interest was further piqued when he subsequently heard rumors that 

the state had put a freeze on the drilling of new wells in the Fowler 

area: such a move might be the beginning of a solution to the water 

depletion, but it was also a classic barrier to the entry of new 

competitors in an industry. Oye had been reflecting on the case of Du Pont 

and chlorofluorocarbons, wondering why a corporation would willingly 

abandon a profitable business by agreeing to phase out the chemicals that 

seem to damage the ozone layer. Du Pont's decision stands out as an 

unusually altruistic gesture amid the selfish strivings of big business. 

Without it the Montreal protocol on ozone-destroying chemicals, a 

prototype for international agreements on the environment, might not have 

come about. Why had Du Pont made that decision? Conventional wisdom, and 

Du Pont's own assertions, credit improved scientific understanding and 

environmental pressure groups. Lobbyists had raised public consciousness 

about the ozone layer so high that Du Pont's executives quickly realized 

that the loss of public good will could cost them more than the products 

were worth. This seems to challenge the logic of tit-for-tat. It suggests 

that appeals to the wider good can be effective where appeals to self

interest cannot.<P>

Oye speculates that this explanation was incomplete, and that the 

company's executives may have been swayed in favor of a ban on CFCs by the 

realization that the CFC technology was mature and vulnerable. Du Pont was 

in danger of losing market share to its rivals. A ban beginning ten years 

hence would at least make it worth no potential rival's while to join in; 

Du Pont could keep its market share for longer and meanwhile stand a 

chance of gaining a dominant market share of the chemicals to replace 

CFCs. Again self-interest was part of the motive for environmental change. 

If consciousness-raising really changes corporate minds, why did the 

utility industry fight the Clean Air Act of 1990 every step of the way? 

The case of Du Pont is not, after all, an exception to the rule that 

self-interest is paramount.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>THE INTANGIBLE CARROTS</B><P>



<font size=5>B</font>ESIDES, environmentalists cannot really believe that mere 

consciousness-raising is enough or they would not lobby so hard in favor 

of enforceable laws. About the only cases in which they can claim to have 

achieved very much through moral suasion are the campaigns against furs 

and ivory. There can be little doubt that the world's leopards breathe 

easier because of the success of campaigns in recent decades against the 

wearing of furs. There was no need to bribe rich socialites to wear fake 

furs--they were easily shamed into it. But then shame can often be as 

effective an incentive as money.<P>

Certainly the environmental movement believes in the power of shame, but 

it also believes in appealing to people's better natures. Yet the evidence 

is thin that normative pressures work for necessities. Furs are luxuries; 

and recycling works better with financial incentives or legal sanctions 

attached. Even a small refund can dramatically increase the amount of 

material that is recycled in household waste. In one Michigan study 

recycling rates were less than 10 percent for nonrefundable glass, metal, 

and plastic, and more than 90 percent for refundable objects. Charities 

have long known that people are more likely to make donations if they are 

rewarded with even just a tag or a lapel pin. Tit for tat.<P>

The issue of normative pressure versus material incentive comes into sharp 

focus in the ivory debate. Western environmentalists and East African 

governments argue that the only hope for saving the elephant is to 

extinguish the demand for ivory by stifling supply and raising 

environmental consciousness. Many economists and southern African 

governments argue otherwise: that local people need incentives if they are 

to tolerate and protect elephants, incentives that must come from a 

regulated market for ivory enabling sustained production. Which is right 

depends on two things: whether it is possible to extinguish the demand for 

ivory in time to save the elephants, and whether the profits from legal 

ivory trading can buy sufficient enforcement to prevent poaching at 

home.<P>

Even if it proved possible to make ivory so shameful a purchase that 

demand died, this would be no precedent for dealing with global warming. 

By giving up ivory, people are losing nothing. By giving up carbon 

dioxide, people are losing part of their standard of living.<P>

Yet again and again in recent years environmentalists have persisted in 

introducing an element of mysticism and morality into the greenhouse 

debate, from Bill McKibben's nostalgia about a nature untouched by man in 

The End of Nature to James Lovelock's invention of the Gaia hypothesis. 

Others have often claimed that a mystical and moral approach works in 

Asia, so why not here? The reverence for nature that characterizes the 

Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu religions stands in marked contrast to the more 

exploitative attitudes of Islam and Christianity. Crossing the border from 

India to Pakistan, one is made immediately aware of the difference: the 

peacocks and monkeys that swarm, tame and confident, over every Indian 

temple and shrine are suddenly scarce and scared in the Muslim country.<P>

In surveying people's attitudes around the Kosi Tappu wildlife reserve in 

southeastern Nepal, Joel Heinen, of the University of Michigan, discovered 

that Brahmin Hindus and Buddhists respect the aims of conservation 

programs much more than Muslims and low-caste Hindus. Nonetheless, 

religious reverence did not stand in the way of the overexploitation of 

nature. Heinen told us, "Sixty-five percent of the households in my survey 

expressed negative attitudes about the reserve, because the reserve took 

away many rights of local citizens." Nepal's and India's forests, 

grasslands, and rivers have suffered tragedies of the commons as severe as 

any country's. The eastern religious harmony with nature is largely lip 

service.<P>

<B>THE GOLDEN AGE THAT NEVER WAS</B><P>



<font size=5>I</font>N recent years those who believe that the narrow view of selfish 

rationalism expressed by economists and biologists is a characteristically 

Western concept have tended to stress not Buddhist peoples but 

pre-industrial peoples living close to nature. Indeed, so common is the 

view that all environmental problems stem from man's recent and hubristic 

attempt to establish dominion over nature, rather than living in harmony 

with it, that this has attained the status of a cliche, uttered by 

politicians as diverse as Pope John Paul II and Albert Gore. It is a 

compulsory part of the preface in most environmental books.<P>

If the cliche is true, then the biologists and economists are largely 

wrong. Individuals can change their attitudes and counteract selfish 

ambitions. If the cliche is false, then it is the intangible incentive of 

shame, not the appeal to collective interest, that changes people's 

minds.<P>

Evidence bearing on this matter comes from archaeologists and 

anthropologists. They are gradually reaching the conclusion that pre

industrial people were just as often capable of environmental 

mismanagement as modern people, and that the legend of an age of 

environmental harmony--before we "lost touch with nature"--is a myth. 

Examples are now legion. The giant birds of Madagascar and New Zealand 

were almost certainly wiped out by man. In 2,000 years the Polynesians 

converted Easter Island, in the eastern Pacific, from a lush forest that 

provided wood for fishing canoes into a treeless, infertile grassland 

where famine, warfare, and cannibalism were rife. Some archaeologists 

believe that the Mayan empire reduced the Yucatan peninsula to meager 

scrub, and so fatally wounded itself. The Anasazi Indians apparently 

deforested a vast area.<P>

History abounds with evidence that limitations of technology or demand, 

rather than a culture of self-restraint, are what has kept tribal people 

from overgrazing their commons. The Indians of Canada had the technology 

to exterminate the beaver long before white men arrived; at that point 

they changed their behavior not because they lost some ancient reverence 

for their prey but because for the first time they had an insatiable 

market for beaver pelts. The Hudson's Bay Company would trade a brass 

kettle or twenty steel fishhooks for every pelt.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>CAUSE FOR HOPE</B><P>



<font size=5>W</font>E conclude that the cynicism of the economist and the biologist about 

man's selfish, shortsighted nature seems justified. The optimism of the 

environmental movement about changing that nature does not. Unless we can 

find a way to tip individual incentives in favor of saving the atmosphere, 

we will fail. Even in a pre-industrial state or with the backing of a 

compassionate, vegetarian religion, humanity proves incapable of 

overriding individual greed for the good of large, diverse groups. So must 

we assume that we are powerless to avert the tragedy of the aerial 

commons, the greenhouse effect?<P>

Fortunately not. Tit-for-tat can come to the rescue. If the principles it 

represents are embodied in the treaties and legislation that are being 

written to avert global warming, then there need be no problem in 

producing an effective, enforceable, and acceptable series of laws.<P>

Care will have to be taken that free-rider countries don't become a 

problem. As Robert Keohane, of Harvard University's Center for 

International Affairs, has stressed, the commons problem is mirrored at 

the international level. Countries may agree to treaties and then try to 

free-ride their way past them. Just as in the case of local commons, there 

seem to be two solutions: to privatize the issue and leave it to 

competition between sovereign states (that is, war), or to centralize it 

and enforce obedience (that is, world government). But Keohane's work on 

international environmental regimes to control such things as acid rain, 

oil pollution, and overfishing came to much the same conclusion as 

Ostrom's; a middle way exists. Trade sanctions, blackmail, bribes, and 

even shame can be used between sovereign governments to create incentives 

for cooperation as long as violations can be easily detected. The implicit 

threat of trade sanctions for CFC manufacture is "a classic piece of 

tit-for-tat," Paul Romer observes.<P>

Local governments within the nation can play tit-for-tat as well. The U.S. 

government is practiced at this art: it often threatens to deprive states 

of highway construction funds, for example, to encourage them to pass 

laws. States can play the same game with counties, or cities, or firms, 

and so on down to the level of the individual, taking care at each stage 

to rig the incentives so that obedience is cheaper than disobedience. Any 

action that raises the cost of being a free-rider, or raises the reward of 

being a cooperator, will work. Let the United States drag its feet over 

the Rio conventions if it wants, but let it feel the sting of some 

sanction for doing so. Let people drive gas-guzzlers if they wish, but tax 

them until it hurts. Let companies lobby against anti-pollution laws, but 

pass laws that make obeying them worthwhile. Make it rational for 

individuals to act "green."<P>

If this sounds unrealistic, remember what many environmental lobbyists are 

calling for. "A fundamental restructuring of many elements of society," 

Lester Brown proposes; "a wholly new economic order." "Modern society will 

find no solution to the ecological problem unless it takes a serious look 

at its lifestyle," the Pope has said. These are hardly realistic aims.<P>

We are merely asking governments to be more cynical about human nature. 

Instead of being shocked that people take such a narrow view of their 

interests, use the fact. Instead of trying to change human nature, go with 

the grain of it. For in refusing to put group good ahead of individual 

advantage, people are being both rational and consistent with their 

evolutionary past.<p>

	<i><font size=4>A product of the conflicting ambitions of the men who shaped it, the War 
on Poverty was ill-fated--but its fate need not be that of all 
anti-poverty programs</i></font><p>
	
	
	<pre>
	
	</pre>
	
	<font size=5>"I</font>n the sixties we waged a war on poverty, and poverty won," Ronald Reagan 
said last year, in one of the one-sentence pronouncements he has sometimes 
made to the press while walking across the White House lawn to his 
helicopter. Most people would probably agree with him. There is a 
widespread perception that the federal government's efforts to help the 
poor during the sixties were almost unlimited; that despite them poverty 
became more severe, not less; and that the reason poverty increased is 
that all those government programs backfired and left their intended 
beneficiaries worse off.<P>
The truth is that the percentage of poor Americans went down substantially 
in the sixties. The idea that poverty increased comes from what people 
know about conditions in inner-city black ghettos, where unemployment, 
crime, illegitimacy, drug abuse, and physical decay did worsen through 
most of the sixties and afterward, even while the rate of black poverty 
overall was dropping. There is a strong temptation to see the ghettos as 
the embodiment of some kind of fundamental rottenness at the core of 
social-welfare liberalism.<P>
The ghettos today are the country's greatest social problem, and with the 
Reagan years at their end, both political parties have begun tentatively 
talking about addressing poverty directly, with government programs. So 
the question of what really did happen in the sixties--what kind of war we 
waged on poverty, and why it didn't heal the ghettos--is of more than 
historical interest right now. It bears directly on our decision about 
whether, and how, to try again.<P>
The sixties' other war, Vietnam, has been re-examined much more 
extensively than the War on Poverty. Even the academic literature on the 
War on Poverty is not extensive. The public is far more familiar with the 
main events and figures of Vietnam (and other great upheavals of the time, 
like the civil-rights movement and the rise of the New Left) than with the 
history of the War on Poverty. This article, which will be continued next 
month, is the first full journalistic account of the War on Poverty--the 
first one based primarily on interviews with the living principals. This 
article also draws on White House papers, some of which have never been 
quoted before, including newly released material from the Richard Nixon 
archives that provide for the first time a close look at Nixon's thinking 
as he began to dismantle the apparatus of the War on Poverty. (The Nixon 
years will be discussed in the second part of this article, which will 
appear next month.)<P>
Among the lessons to be drawn from the story of the War on Poverty is that 
what happened is not preordained to happen again. The War on Poverty was 
planned in a time of much greater national harmony and prosperity than 
exists now, with an optimism that today seems reckless, and carried out in 
a time of much greater tension and violence. The main tactic that the 
government used to fight poverty was a new and unproved one; almost no 
effort was made to find out what kinds of anti-poverty programs already 
worked and then to expand them.<P>
We now think of the sixties as a time of faith in big government, but it 
wasn't. The War on Poverty looked for solutions to poverty that would be 
local and diffuse, and would circumvent state and local government and 
Congress. This earned the enmity of members of Congress, mayors, 
governors, and Cabinet secretaries, so the War on poverty was in trouble 
politically from the start. Its planners hoped to build public support for 
it by achieving quick, visible successes, but in setting up hundreds of 
separate anti-poverty organizations run largely by inexperienced people, 
they practically guaranteed that there would be quite a few highly 
publicized failures. These turned public opinion against the War on 
Poverty.<P>
Out in the field, especially in the ghettos, the War on Poverty was 
carried out in disregard of a powerful demographic force. It tried, and 
later government antipoverty programs tried even more pointedly, to revive 
the ghettos as communities. But the ghettos were dying all the while, 
because millions of their residents were moving out, into new and 
better-off black neighborhoods. The more the government tried to create 
opportunity in the ghettos, the more opportunity it created for people to 
leave the ghettos. In fact, opening up jobs and housing that enabled 
people to move out was one of the great, if originally unintended, 
successes in the government's anti-poverty efforts. The people who 
couldn't or wouldn't take advantage of the new opportunities stayed behind 
to form the core of the underclass. Some government programs that were 
aimed at helping these people by giving them the education and training 
they needed to get out did have considerable success, but they were of 
limited scope.<P>
A final important aspect of the War on Poverty is its place in the 
political competition between Robert Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson which 
dominated Washington at the time. It was Johnson who declared war on 
poverty, but he did so looking over his shoulder at Kennedy, and Kennedy, 
not Johnson, was the political sponsor of the war's main strategies. 
Johnson and Kennedy cared more about black poverty than did any other 
major politicians of the twentieth century, but they disliked and 
mistrusted each other so much that they were incapable of cooperating on 
the cause that was closest to both their hearts. Because the two men could 
not reconcile their ideas, the War on Poverty became an untenable 
combination of Kennedy's love for the rebellious moral crusade and 
Johnson's for the grandiose political gesture.<P>
<BR><p>
<b>THE NEED FOR A LYNDON JOHNSON INITIATIVE</b><P>
Lyndon Johnson's state of mind in his first few days as President included 
a generous helping of insecurity. Johnson's self-esteem was not unshakable 
to begin with, and almost immediately after the assassination it became 
clear to him that he was going to be compared unfavorably with John F. 
Kennedy. Johnson did not consider Kennedy to have been a towering figure, 
but he knew that Kennedy had won over the makers of enlightened opinion, 
the journalists and intellectuals and speech-making liberal politicians. 
These people had never liked Johnson. He used to complain to friends that 
even when he had been a liberal congressman, back in the thirties, he had 
been unable to win the approval of the liberal establishment, not so much 
for substantive reasons as because he was a southwesterner with a 
second-rate education who looked and talked like a hick. On the day after 
the assassination he told President Kennedy's top assistant, Theodore 
Sorensen, that he knew he lacked President Kennedy's education, culture, 
and understanding, but that he would try his best. Johnson gave Sorensen 
his first assignment by saying, "I want you to draw the threads together 
on the domestic program, but don't expect me to absorb things as fast as 
you're used to."<P>
Johnson may have been playing to what he already knew to be Sorensen's 
opinion of his abilities, but he had never been able to disregard 
condescension when it was directed at him. Proving that it was misplaced 
and establishing himself as President were related tasks. Late in the day 
on Saturday, November 73, 1963, Walter Heller, Kennedy's chief economic 
adviser, was called into the Oval Office to brief Johnson. "Just as I was 
about to go out of his office and had opened the door," Heller wrote in 
notes he made just after the conversation and marked HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL, 
"the President gently pushed it shut and drew me back in and said, 'Now, I 
want to say something about all this talk that I'm a conservative who is 
likely to go back to the Eisenhower days or give in to the economy bloc in 
Congress. It's not so, and I want you to tell your friends--Arthur 
Schlesinger, Galbraith, and other liberals--that it is not so....If you 
looked at my record, you would know that I am a Roosevelt New Dealer. As a 
matter of fact, to tell the truth, John F. Kennedy was a little too 
conservative to suit my taste."<P>
For some months Heller had been urging Kennedy to launch what he called an 
"attack on poverty." At the time of the assassination it was in the 
planning stages and had not received any public attention. Johnson was 
instantly attracted to the idea. According to Heller's notes of the 
meeting, "The new President expressed his interest in it, his sympathy for 
it, and in answer to a point-blank question, said we should push ahead 
full-tilt on this project." As Heller remembered it years later, "I told 
him it was the last thing I'd discussed with Kennedy. He said, That's my 
kind of program. It's a people program.'"<P>
A week later Johnson invited two old friends, Arthur Goldschmidt and his 
wife, Elizabeth Wickenden, over for Sunday dinner at his house in 
Washington, where he and his family were still living while Jacqueline 
Kennedy prepared to leave the White House. The invitation itself signaled 
a change in Johnson. The couple were liberals who had long worked in 
government, friends from his days as a New Deal congressman, and they and 
the Johnsons had been less close since the late thirties, when Johnson 
began preparing to run for the Senate. Changing constituencies, from his 
congressional district to all of Texas, had caused Johnson to modulate his 
politics. Now that he was President, his constituency had changed again, 
in the opposite direction, becoming more liberal, and this made him think 
back to his time in Congress.<P>
"Johnson talked very freely at that Sunday dinner," Wickenden says today. 
"He said, 'I have a very difficult problem. I feel a moral obligation to 
finish the things that JFK proposed. But I also have to find issues I can 
take on as my own.' So he came to this poverty program--making it 
nationwide. He didn't go into what it would do specifically. He said, 'I 
have to get re-elected in a year and a half, so I have to have something 
of my own.'"<P>
Johnson quickly discovered, though, that finishing the work of the Kennedy 
Administration was not going to be a matter of passing Kennedy's modest 
legislative agenda. Almost immediately after the assassination the Kennedy 
legacy began to grow, especially where liberal issues like the attack on 
poverty were concerned. The Kennedy camp framed the question facing 
Johnson as whether he could possibly accomplish all the things that it 
claimed John Kennedy would have done.<P>
In early December of 1963 Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., published an article on 
Kennedy in the Saturday Evening Post. He wrote, "In one of the last talks 
I had with him, he was musing about the legislative program for next 
January, and said, 'The time has come to organize a national assault on 
the causes of poverty, a comprehensive program, across the board.'" No 
sooner was Schlesinger's article published than Johnson wrote a letter to 
the American Public Welfare Association promising, identically, "a 
national assault on the causes of poverty." The severely grieving Robert 
Kennedy found a piece of notepaper on which his brother, during the last 
Cabinet meeting he had conducted, had scribbled the word poverty several 
times and circled it; he framed it and kept it in his office at the 
Justice Department. By the time Lyndon Johnson assumed the presidency, 
fighting poverty had taken on the coloration of having been John F. 
Kennedy's last wish.<P>
In truth there is no evidence that this was his last wish, and it is not 
at all clear how far Kennedy would have let Heller go with his poverty 
program. Certainly all the living principals agree today that one thing 
Kennedy would not have done is publicly declare war on poverty. In 
Heller's next-to-last talk with Kennedy on the subject, on October 21, 
1963, Kennedy had, it is true, been quite enthusiastic. He said that an 
article on a poor white area of Kentucky by Homer Bigart in the previous 
day's New York Times had convinced him that "there was a tremendous 
problem to be met," according to Heller's notes of the meeting. The notes 
continue, "It's perfectly clear that he is aroused about this and if we 
could really produce a program to fit the bill, he would be inclined to 
run with it."<P>
Compared with those comments, however, Kennedy's last words to Heller 
about the poverty problem, at a meeting on November 19, three days before 
the assassination, represented a pulling-back. In the time between the two 
talks Kennedy had been briefed on the 1964 election by Richard Scammon, 
the director of the census. Scammon said that many voters thought that 
federal programs really didn't help them. Kennedy asked him how a new 
poverty program might affect the campaign. Scammon said that it wouldn't 
do him much good, because most voters didn't consider themselves poor, and 
those who did weren't the ones a Democratic presidential candidate had to 
win over. On November 19, according to Heller's notes, "I wondered just 
what his current feeling about it was. His attitude was, 'No, I'm still 
very much in favor of doing something on the poverty theme if we can get a 
good program, but I also think it's important to make clear that we're 
doing something for the middle-income man in the suburbs, etc. But the two 
are not at all inconsistent with one another. So go right ahead with your 
work on it.'"<P>
In December of 1963 Johnson, in order to avoid seeming to abandon 
Kennedy's commitment to an attack on poverty, would have to do much more 
than Kennedy himself had been prepared to do. And there was a further 
complication to this business of the Kennedy legacy: the Kennedy poverty 
program, such as it was, was one with which Johnson felt instinctively 
uncomfortable right from the beginning.<P>
<BR><p>
<b>WHEN RACE, GHETTOS, AND POVERTY SEEMED MINOR PROBLEMS</b><P>
Between the beginning of the Second World War and the end of Johnson's 
presidency more than four million black Americans moved from the rural 
South to the urban North. Along with affluence and the Baby Boom, this was 
one of the great transforming demographic events of American life after 
the war, one that profoundly affected such diverse matters as urban 
geography, education, popular music, presidential politics, and government 
social policy. Unlike affluence and the Baby Boom, though, the great black 
migration was not widely recognized as important while it was happening. 
By the fall of 1965 Lyndon Johnson's poverty program would stand as the 
national government's chief direct response to the problems of the 
northern ghettos to which the migrants came, but the program was conceived 
with only the haziest understanding of what the ghettos' problems were.<P>
Today, with the events of the civil-rights movement enshrined in history 
and racial issues a constant theme in politics, government, the press, 
entertainment, and intellectual life, it is easy to forget how different 
the feel of race was inside the American establishment at the time Johnson 
took office. The Montgomery bus boycott had taken place in 1955 and 1956, 
but well after that most liberals considered the segregation of public 
facilities and the denial of the vote to blacks in the South, though 
wrong, not a pressing moral crisis for the nation. It was still an Eleanor 
Roosevelt issue rather than a primary concern for tough, pragmatic 
liberals. The civil-rights movement was tiny: the Congress of Racial 
Equality had a field staff of two people in 1960, the year before it began 
to stage the Freedom Rides. The most famous civil-rights event of the 1960 
presidential campaign was a phone call that Kennedy made to Coretta Scott 
King to console her about the imprisonment of her husband in Georgia. 
Kennedy made the call only because his brother-in-law and chief 
civil-rights adviser, Sargent Shriver, got him alone in a room, away from 
his political strategists and his brother Robert, who, Shriver knew, would 
be opposed to the call. A day later Robert Kennedy called the judge who 
had put Martin Luther King, Jr., in jail, to ask for King's release, but 
this, Kennedy revealed later, was at the request of the governor of 
Georgia, who had asked him to put pressure on the judge. A long jail term, 
the governor thought, would raise King's visibility in Georgia and thus 
worsen Kennedy's chances of carrying the state in November.<P>
Blacks in the North were regarded during the 1960 campaign as classic 
machine
politics urban ethnic voters, rather than an oppressed group with a moral 
claim to justice. As Robert Kennedy said in 1964, "I think those running 
for office in the Democratic Party looked to just three or four people who 
would then deliver the Negro vote. And you never had to say you were going 
to do anything on civil rights." Of the four black members of Congress, 
the one with the highest national profile, Adam Clayton Powell, of New 
York City, was regarded inside the political world as an intermittently 
lovable rogue who, in Robert Kennedy's words, "always exacts a price, a 
monetary price, for his support"; for whatever reason, Powell had endorsed 
Dwight Eisenhower for President in 1956. Besides courting the black 
congressmen, presidential candidates campaigned in northern black 
communities by buying advertising in black newspapers. An important issue 
in the Kennedy campaign's efforts among blacks in 1960 was that the black 
publishers had not yet been paid for advertisements bought in 1956, and 
they were reluctant to get behind the Democratic ticket until they were. 
The feeling that money changing hands was necessary for black support led 
the Kennedy campaign to offer to buy Simeon Booker's column in Jet 
magazine--meaning that it would continue to appear under Booker's name but 
would be written by the Kennedy staff until November. (Booker and his 
publisher refused.)<P>
In 1960 there simply was no widespread sense that the country would soon 
become intensely preoccupied with race relations. The prevailing view of 
black life in the North in the early sixties was optimistic: blacks who 
left the South were bound to better themselves economically as well as to 
escape legal segregation. Alarmism about ethnic migrations to cities 
seemed like a relic of the 1880s, long since proved unjustified by the 
experience of the Irish, the Italians, the Jews, and others. In 1963 James 
Baldwin published The Fire Next Time. In 1964 the first summer race riot 
of the decade occurred, in Harlem, but outside New York this harbinger of 
disaster in the ghettos wasn't seen for what it was. As late as February 
of 1964 Business Week was optimistic enough about the power of migration 
to solve the problems of black America to say, "The basic cause of Negro 
poverty is discrimination--in education, jobs, access to medical care. 
Many Negroes have improved their lot by moving to the cities. But many 
others still live in the rural South."<P>
<BR>
<p>
In the ghettos the mood had already begun to turn sour by the time Kennedy 
was elected President. Virtually everywhere in the urban North there was 
strict residential segregation, which meant that as the migration 
continued, overcrowding became an increasingly serious problem in the 
ghettos. Public schools had to begin running double shifts, and many of 
the new students were starting at a disadvantage, because they and their 
parents were products of the inferior black rural school systems in the 
South. Hard drugs had appeared. Crime began to rise. The economic 
rationale for the migration was beginning to evaporate: during the 
prosperous early sixties manufacturing employment dropped in such cities 
as New York, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Newark. The 
welfare rolls were growing. The Black Muslims were catching on, a 
development viewed within the ghettos as salutary, because of the Muslims' 
amazing ability to rehabilitate criminals, but nonetheless a sign that 
there was fertile ground for a bitter anti-white ideology.<P>
Before the Kennedy assassination the white public-policy experts who knew 
all this constituted a self-conscious advance guard. In the late fifties a 
psychiatrist at the National Institutes of Mental Health named Leonard 
Duhl convened a group of social scientists who for a decade discussed 
ghettos, among other exotic subjects, under the rubric of studying the 
country's mental health. They called themselves the "space cadets," 
because on the day Sputnik was launched, one of them said, "If people 
think the Russians are out in space, they should see us." At around the 
same time, a program officer at the Ford Foundation named Paul Ylvisaker, 
who often rode the bus to the airport through the growing Newark ghetto, 
and who sensed a mood of stored-up anger there, started a Gray Areas 
program at the foundation-
"gray areas" being a euphemism for black areas. And also in the late 
fifties Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlin, two academic experts on juvenile 
delinquency, were helping to found Mobilization for Youth, on the Lower 
East Side of Manhattan, which they hoped would be a new kind of 
social-service agency to help the ghettos.<P>
<BR>

There was cross-fertilization among these groups, and by the fall of 1961 
all of them had established relations with an obscure new federal agency 
called the President's Committee on Juvenile Delinquency. The agency had 
been created at the instigation of John Kennedy's sister, Eunice Shriver, 
who was the family social worker, having long been interested in mental 
retardation, physical handicaps, and juvenile delinquency, which she had 
studied while a staff member of a government commission in the forties. 
She talked her brother the President into establishing a 
juvenile-delinquency committee and he put his brother the Attorney General 
in charge of it. Robert Kennedy, in turn, made David Hackett the director 
of the committee.<P>
Hackett, Robert Kennedy's best friend from prep school, was surely the 
unlikeliest possible liaison between the federal government and the 
leading edge of left-liberal social policy. At Milton Academy, in Milton, 
Massachusetts, in the 1930s, Robert Kennedy had been, to use Hackett's 
word, a "misfit"--Irish in a school with no Irish, Catholic in a school 
with no Catholics, runty, shy, and the son of Joseph P. Kennedy, a hated 
figure in the Boston WASP culture that dominated the school. Hackett, who 
had grown up near Milton and was descended from a line of Episcopalian 
naval officers, was the star of the school, a great athlete (he played on 
two U.S. Olympic hockey teams), who supposedly was the model for the 
Phineas character in John Knowles's A Separate Peace. He alone in the 
Milton student body befriended Bobby Kennedy. Thus the psychological 
grounding of their friendship contained an element of Hackett's reaching 
out to the oppressed and of Kennedy's feeling oppressed himself. And the 
two shared a mistrust of what Hackett calls "normal 
behavior"--pejoratively, since it was normal behavior that had caused 
Kennedy's prep-school ostracism.<P>
Before the Kennedy presidential campaign Hackett was the editor of an 
entertainment guide distributed free to hotel guests in Montreal. He 
joined the campaign as a delegate counter, and after the inauguration was 
given a small office adjoining Robert Kennedy's in the Justice Department. 
He was not part of the inner circle there; people didn't know what he did, 
exactly, and in contrast to the Rhodes scholars and law-review editors 
with whom Kennedy surrounded himself at Justice, who were laconic, Hackett 
was simply inarticulate. Having begun a sentence, he often found it 
impossible to extricate himself, and helplessly waved his hands or said 
"et cetera" to imply that everyone understood what he was trying to say. 
He was emotional, ruled by his heart, much more than the other Kennedy 
men. The rest of them have gone on to jobs running major institutions, 
while Hackett directs a tiny foundation in Washington.<P>
Juvenile delinquency was a perfect theme for Robert Kennedy, involving as 
it did two of his central concerns, young people and fighting crime. But 
among experts in the field, many of whom the completely unintellectual and 
nonideological Hackett now had to meet, it was the subject of an abstruse 
debate. The academic study of juvenile delinquency was dominated by a 
long-standing fight between social workers and sociologists--to be 
specific, between the School of Social Service Administration and the 
sociology department at the University of Chicago. Social workers tended 
at the time to focus on the individual, sociologists on the society; 
delinquency was said by social workers to be caused by an insufficiently 
nurturing mother or a too-threatening father, while to sociologists it was 
part of a larger social process. The Chicago sociology department, under 
the influence of Professor Robert Park, had a tradition of taking to the 
city's neighborhoods to learn what life was really like--Park had 
dispatched his graduate students to the funerals of the victims in the St. 
Valentine's Day massacre, because they'd get good stuff there. One of 
Park's proteges, Clifford Shaw, wrote the seminal book in the 
juvenile-delinquency field, Delinquency Areas (1929), which showed that 
certain poor neighborhoods in Chicago had always led the city in 
delinquency, no matter which ethnic groups were living in them. He saw 
delinquency as merely a stage in the great ongoing natural process of 
assimilation.<P>
In the fifties the latest twist in delinquency theory was to marry the 
street-wise Shaw tradition to the concept of anomie, especially as 
elaborated by Robert K. Merton, of Columbia University, the leading 
theoretical sociologist of the day. Anomie was said to afflict teenage 
males when they experience a conflict between what they want and what they 
can get--when they lack the means to achieve their goals. Delinquency was 
seen as an expression of anomie. Delinquent Boys, by Albert K. Cohen, 
published in 1955, explained delinquency as the result of a realization by 
lower-class kids that they couldn't have middle-class success and so had 
to set up an alternative status system in which they could succeed.<P>
In 1960 Cloward and Ohlin published Delinquency and Opportunity, which 
went Cohen one better by arguing that delinquents turned to crime not out 
of a sense of failure but because society had denied them any other form 
of opportunity: in effect, their delinquency constituted a critique, and a 
perceptive one, of society. There were nowhere near enough data available 
in 1961 to prove or disprove the correctness of this theory; in any case, 
the debate about whether social deviancy is the individual's fault or 
society's has been going on in the industrial world for centuries, and it 
will never be settled. The appeal of Delinquency and Opportunity to 
government was theoretical, not practical.<P>
Hackett himself is no great help in explaining why, as he made his way 
through the thicket of explanations for delinquency, the Cloward-Ohlin 
theory attracted him. "It just made sense to me," he says. He hired Ohlin 
as a consultant and made a large grant to Mobilization for Youth, which 
was announced by President Kennedy himself in May of 1962. The idea of 
insufficient opportunity as the cause of delinquency was the guiding 
principle of the Committee on Juvenile Delinquency as it made grants to 
organizations all over the country, several of them working in urban black 
ghettos. <P>
In the Kennedy family by far the most devoted adherent of the theory was 
the Attorney General. To the President the theory seems to have been a 
technical point to be mastered, but it became one of the fundamental 
principles of his brother's life. Ohlin briefed both Kennedy brothers, at 
different times. John Kennedy listened impassively to Ohlin for ten 
minutes just before he was to announce the Mobilization for Youth grant 
and then walked outside, gave a flawless summary, and went on to the next 
item on his agenda with his customary coolness. Robert Kennedy, who had 
invited Ohlin to breakfast on the day he was to testify in Congress in 
behalf of the authorization of funds for the committee, took much longer 
to get it. Finally, in the car riding to Capitol Hill, he said, "Oh, I 
see--if I had grown up in these circumstances, this could have happened to 
me."<P>
<BR>
Poverty, as a topic of national concern, was only a little bit less 
peripheral than ghettos in the years before the War on Poverty was 
launched. John Kenneth Galbraith's The Affluent Society, the liberal bible 
of the late fifties, included a chapter on poverty which so much 
downplayed it as a problem that Senator Paul Douglas, of Illinois, 
commissioned a study refuting Galbraith. The reason that poverty was not a 
major issue even for liberals was that it seemed to be disappearing in the 
post-Second World War boom. From 1947 to 1957 the percentage of American 
families with incomes under $2,000 went from 35 to 23, and the percentage 
of black families went down even more dramatically, from 62 to 36. The 
rate of exit from poverty had begun to slow in the late fifties, but this 
was not widely known; prevailing opinion agreed with Galbraith that 
poverty had become confined mainly to "poverty pockets," like Appalachia. 
John Kennedy had seen some of these during his primary campaign in West 
Virginia, and after taking office he set up the Appalachian Regional 
Commission to try to improve conditions there.<P>
At the level of practical politics there was (and still is) a fundamental 
hostility in congressional and public opinion to the idea of an American 
welfare state, especially one that gives money to poor people. The biggest 
social-welfare program, Social Security, travels under the guise of an 
insurance policy; Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the main 
program for making cash grants to the poor, was created along with Social 
Security in l935 and was billed as a kind of pension plan for widows and 
orphans rather than a welfare system. Even though it has been widely 
believed for decades that AFDC encourages the formation of single-parent 
families, only last September did Congress pass a provision making all 
two-parent poor out-of-work families in the country eligible for 
welfare.<P>
Michael Harrington's The Other America, which claimed that one third of 
the country was poor, was published in 1962, and it was rescued from 
obscurity by a long review in The New Yorker by Dwight Macdonald, which 
appeared in January of 1963. (The consensus among President Kennedy's 
aides is that he read the Macdonald article, not the Harrington book. The 
article, dry, witty, and elegantly written, would have been much more to 
Kennedy's taste than the book, which is earnest and impassioned.) But 
practical-minded Washington liberals didn't for a minute believe that 
books and articles about poverty would suddenly melt Congress's deep 
hostility to social-welfare programs. The liberal cause of the time in 
Washington was increasing government spending, in order to stimulate the 
economy (the unemployment rate in the Kennedy years was over five percent, 
which was considered unacceptably high) and to respond to Galbraith's 
warning that America was becoming a nation of "private affluence and 
public squalor." Even this proved impracticable, though. Kennedy, 
possessing neither great legislative skill nor a sweeping electoral 
mandate, couldn't get spending programs past the southern committee 
chairmen who ruled Congress.<P>
In March of 1962 Walter Heller began pushing a tax cut as an easier way to 
stimulate the economy, and in January of 1963 Kennedy finally agreed to 
the idea. That March, Heller raised the subject of poverty with Kennedy, 
taking care to couch it in practical terms: since the poor didn't pay 
taxes, he said, the tax cut would come under attack for being a subsidy to 
the middle class and the rich unless the Administration did something for 
poor people at the same time. In June, Robert Lampman, an old student of 
Heller's who had temporarily joined his staff, worked up a memo on the 
subject of poverty.<P>
Lampman, who considered himself more the realist than Heller, believed 
that any program aimed at doing something about poverty was doomed. 
"Probably a politically acceptable program must avoid completely any use 
of the term 'inequality' or of the term 'REDISTRIBUTION of income or 
wealth,'" he wrote Heller. In August, Lampman returned to a professorship 
at the University of Wisconsin, pessimistic about the future of the 
poverty initiative. Heller pressed on, without much success. He invited 
John Kenneth Galbraith to a lunch at the White House mess with several 
government officials, but, as Heller remembers it, Galbraith, too, was 
cool to the idea of a concerted effort to help the poor. As Heller told 
me, "Ken sort of took the position he took in The Affluent Society--'We 
even build our superhighways over them, on concrete stilts.' His position 
was, they were not a major element in the picture--not that it wasn't a 
problem, but that it was a problem the political system wasn't going to 
address."<P>
Heller began to talk up poverty among the political people around Kennedy 
who would make the final decisions about the 1964 legislative program. The 
argument emerged--political people say from Heller, who they sometimes 
wished would stick to economics--that a poverty program would help in the 
1964 campaign, not by bringing in more of the poor-person vote but by 
pulling good-hearted suburban Republican Protestant churchwomen away from 
Nelson Rockefeller.<P>
With the departure of Lampman, Heller put another of his assistants, 
William Capron, in charge of poverty, and Capron began to convene meetings 
of people from several federal departments and agencies to figure out what 
the poverty effort would actually consist of. This was a disaster, at 
least in the views of Heller and Capron. Every government agency has a 
wish list of programs it has long been unable to get past the White House 
and Congress; the poverty idea brought out the wish lists, and a number of 
programs that hadn't made the cut for the New Deal, thirty years earlier, 
came up. The Secretary of Labor, Willard Wirtz, a ponderous man who had 
been Adlai Stevenson's law partner in Chicago, wanted jobs programs, run 
by the Labor Department. The key bureaucrat at the Department of Health, 
Education, and Welfare, Wilbur Cohen, an old New Dealer and a veteran 
lobbyist for social-welfare programs, wanted education and welfare 
programs, run by HEW. Neither man shared Heller's belief that something 
publicly billed as an attack on poverty could work. In October, after 
months of meetings, Capron presented Theodore Sorensen with a list of 150 
separate programs for fighting poverty, intending to demonstrate what a 
mess the departments were making of the effort. He got the reaction he had 
been hoping for: Sorensen firmly told him to come back with something 
better.<P>
<BR>
<p>
<b>THE SOLUTION ARRIVES</b><P>
The poverty fighters in the white house were like frontier settlers with 
their wagons circled and the arrows flying in faster and faster: they 
needed the cavalry to ride to their rescue. It came in the form of the 
crime-fighters at the President's Committee on Juvenile Delinquency. The 
committee's poverty-fighting (and delinquency
fighting) idea was called community action. Over the years there was a 
great deal of confusion about what community action meant--not 
surprisingly. It was an intentionally vague idea, difficult to understand 
and subject to widely varying interpretations.<P>
The theory of community action was that what poor people needed were new 
neighborhood-based organizations. As it was, there were many government 
efforts to help the poor--nutrition programs, employment programs, welfare 
programs--but there was no coordination among them, and no concerted 
attempt had been made to find out what services the people in the poor 
neighborhoods most needed. Under community action the government would set 
up a kind of planning board in the neighborhood, the board would consult 
with the poor people there, and, eventually, a mission would emerge. In 
principle, a community-action agency could do ANYTHING--it was not an 
anti-poverty program so much as a mechanism through which new anti-poverty 
programs would be invented. Also, rather than take on all the traditional 
functions of a government agency itself, it would be small and would 
coordinate the work of existing agencies. The only rule was that the 
solution to the neighborhood's problems could not be imposed from above 
(that is, from Washington).<P>
In practice, community action was not quite so Zen-like. The activities of 
organizations that received grants from the Committee on Juvenile 
Delinquency varied, but not radically. Probably the two best-known early 
grant recipients were Mobilization for Youth and the Ford Foundation's 
Gray Areas program in New Haven, Connecticut. Both offered remedial 
education, job training, and help in getting poor people through the 
welfare and health-care bureaucracies. Mobilization for Youth was more 
confrontational, occasionally organizing rent strikes and demonstrations 
at government offices, while the New Haven project had a spirit closer to 
that of an old-fashioned settlement house, whose aim was to teach 
immigrants (in this case Puerto Ricans and southern blacks) the skills 
they needed to assimilate in the new land.<P>
To Walter Heller, community action had value as a theory (he was an old 
friend of E. F. Schumacher, who later wrote Small Is Beautiful), but more 
to the point, it solved all the bureaucratic problems of pulling together 
the Kennedy attack on poverty. It had a powerful bureaucratic patron in 
Robert Kennedy. Involving as it did one-year local grants, it was much 
cheaper than the big national programs that Labor and HEW were proposing, 
and President Kennedy didn't want to spend much money. Community action 
seemed small, flexible, and nonbureaucratic, and this was consistent with 
the ethos of the Kennedy Administration. In domestic policy as in foreign, 
there was a strong bias toward doings things through lean, action
oriented agencies--the Peace Corps, the Green Berets--rather than through 
the clumsy, slow-moving traditional bureaucracies and their friends in 
Congress. Heller had already decided that poverty could be fought 
effectively only through a new government agency. Finally, community 
action was easy to sell inside the Administration, because it had the 
sheen of originality: it was the only proposal for fighting poverty that 
seemed fresh and new and exciting.<P>
It is by no means universally accepted that crime and poverty are caused 
by a lack of opportunity. But if you accept the premise, then increasing 
opportunity ought to cure crime and poverty. In retrospect, there was a 
glaring logical flaw in community action. Past experience suggested that 
the best way for the federal government to increase opportunity for the 
poor was through major national efforts: lowering the unemployment rate, 
improving schools, undertaking public works, and eliminating 
discrimination. Sometimes the programs that turned out to be the most 
effective at reducing poverty--like the Homestead Act, the Erie Canal, 
universal public education, and the GI Bill--weren't planned for that 
purpose but nonetheless changed social and economic conditions in some 
important way. Community action, however, was based on the idea that only 
through local efforts--in fact, only through efforts inside the poorest 
neighborhoods--could the government increase opportunity. How, it now 
seems fair to ask, could there have been so much faith in the ability of a 
program INSIDE the ghettos to increase the amount of opportunity available 
to the people living there?<P>
Policy-makers are always strongly impelled to believe what it is 
convenient for them to believe. For foundation executives, or social 
activists, or officials of a tiny government committee, or members of the 
White House staff who knew there was nearly no give in the federal budget, 
the temptation to find small-scale solutions to the large problem of 
poverty was very strong. Community action was at least a beginning. Also, 
the urban ethnic neighborhood was then just starting to be glorified as an 
alternative to the conformist, gray-flannel tract-house America of the 
Eisenhower years. In the late fifties Leonard Duhl's group at the National 
Institutes of Mental Health had funded an influential book by Herbert Gans 
called The Urban Villagers, about a thriving Italian neighborhood in the 
West End of Boston that had been destroyed by an urban-renewal program 
under the misguided banner of slum clearance.<P>
The interstate highway system and urban renewal (or, to use the nickname 
its critics gave it, "Negro removal") were to liberals' minds two of the 
great mistakes of the Eisenhower years, promoting downtown business 
development and suburban sprawl at the expense of vibrant, though poor, 
inner-city communities.<P>
By the time President Kennedy was killed, Walter Heller and his circle had 
decided that the attack on poverty should begin with the creation of a 
handful of community-action demonstration projects. They had not formally 
presented this idea to Kennedy, however. Selling Lyndon Johnson on 
fighting poverty had been accomplished with great ease on his first day as 
President. Now they had to sell him on community action.<P>
<BR>

This was not an easy task. Johnson shared almost none of the opinions that 
had steered Heller toward community action. He liked the New Deal. He 
liked the Labor Department and HEW. He liked the old-line committees in 
Congress. Johnson was uncomfortable with abstract concepts: he liked 
government programs that involved things you could see and touch, that 
produced results. "His conception of the War on Poverty had this sort of 
CONCRETE idea," Heller told me. Bulldozers. Tractors. People operating 
heavy machinery."<P>
Over the Christmas holidays of 1963 Heller and Kermit Gordon, the director 
of the Bureau of the Budget, flew down to the LBJ Ranch, where part of 
their mission was to talk Johnson into community action. "Kermit told me 
he and Heller presented it to Johnson, but [Johnson] was scared." says 
William Cannon, who was Gordon's assistant assigned to the poverty 
program. "He killed the community-action part of it. But the next day they 
persuaded him, so they came back to Washington with it in." It is not at 
all clear how much Johnson understood about what he was agreeing to, or 
what his reasons were. All through 1964 rumors would emanate from the 
White House that Johnson had thought community action was going to be like 
the old National Youth Administration, the New Deal agency where Johnson 
had worked before running for Congress, and that he hadn't realized that 
it would give money to local nonprofit organizations. Certainly some of 
the appeal that community action held for him must have been financial. He 
told Heller and Gordon that they had to hold the federal budget under $100 
billion, because he didn't want to look like an irresponsible spender in 
an election year.<P>
For $500 million in new funds, which is what he gave Heller and Gordon for 
poverty-fighting, a much more visible program could be created through 
community action than through more traditional means.<P>
As he approved community action, Johnson also changed it. The advocates of 
the idea had intended to start small. Heller's staff wanted ten local 
community-action agencies, five urban and five rural. Hackett thought that 
even this was too much, and proposed that the initial funding for the War 
on Poverty be $1 million a year. But Johnson was by nature not interested 
in small, slowly developing programs, especially when his first major 
initiative as President was involved. The President on whom he modeled 
himself was not, after all, Kennedy but Franklin D. Roosevelt. Once, while 
strolling through the White House with Hugh Sidey, of Time, Johnson 
stopped at a bust of FDR and caressed it. "Look at the strength in that 
face!" he told Sidey. The poverty program was the opening shot in 
Johnson's New Deal. By the end of January, 1964, the plans were for 
community action to begin in seventy-five cities.<P>
As Allen Matusow points out in his book The Unraveling of America, there 
was no proof at that point (and there is still no proof) that any of the 
local organizations funded by the President's Committee on Juvenile 
Delinquency had actually reduced delinquency. Hackett himself said a few 
years later, "There've been a great many critics of the program, that it 
was not successful; that's probably right." It was just as unclear whether 
community-action agencies could reduce poverty. Community action was a 
totally untested idea that Johnson suddenly transformed into a large 
undertaking.<P>
Some of Johnson's old friends felt that by giving the nod to community 
action Johnson showed not just his ambition but also the uncertainty of 
his self-esteem. Here was an idea that his instincts told him to avoid but 
that all the Kennedy people were for--Heller and Gordon and Ted Sorensen 
and, not least important, Robert Kennedy. "If THEY thought it up, that was 
it," says Horace Busby, who had been a Johnson aide since the late 
forties, and who was the lone dissenter in the discussions of community 
action at the ranch that Christmas. Elizabeth Wickenden wrote a memo 
opposing community action and in response got a form letter from a White 
House aide thanking her for her interest. On the last Sunday night in 
1963, after a meeting with Heller, Gordon, and Sorensen, Busby stayed up 
late in Johnson's office at the ranch, writing Johnson a memo that urged 
him to go slower. Five years later it was clear that the Democratic 
Party's greatest problem was (as it still is) an inability to hold 
middle-class voters; Busby was almost alone in seeing that the 
anti-poverty effort might come across as a departure from rather than a 
continuation of the New Deal, and thus alienate part of Johnson's natural 
constituency. He wrote, "It is the American in the middle...who is the key 
to our economy, society, and political stability...his consent is 
vital--his dissent fatal--to our social progress vis-a-vis Negro rights, 
etc."<P>
In his 1964 State of the Union address, delivered on January 8 and written 
primarily by Theodore Sorensen, Lyndon Johnson said, "This Administration 
today, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty in America." 
His speech did not mention community action at all; instead, Johnson 
talked about such old-fashioned ideas as better education, housing, health 
care, and job training, and he was careful to mention the need to work 
closely with state and local governments. A research study ordered up 
afterward by Johnson showed that the speech had been interrupted by 
applause more times than any other State of the Union speech since 1933.<P>
<BR>
<p>
<b>THE UN-KENNEDY</b><P>
On February 1 Johnson appointed Sargent Shriver head of the War on 
Poverty, and essentially dropped out of the planning himself. The 
appointment of Shriver represented a victory for Walter Heller, because it 
implied that a new agency would be created--Shriver was too much of a 
heavyweight to be made an assistant secretary of HEW or Labor. But there 
was more to it than that.<P>
In the public's mind, Shriver was a Kennedy: Eunice Kennedy's husband, 
John and Robert Kennedy's brother-in-law. So it appeared that Johnson was 
so deeply loyal to the dead President's desire to fight poverty that he 
would entrust it only to a family member. As the director of the Peace 
Corps, Shriver was already perhaps the most visibly successful head of an 
agency in the federal government; certainly he had demonstrated an ability 
to get a new agency off the ground and to win over Congress, the press, 
and the liberals. He had close ties to the White House through Johnson's 
adviser Bill Moyers, who was his deputy director at the Peace Corps and 
who had promoted Shriver for the poverty job, hoping to open up the Peace 
Corps directorship for himself. (Johnson, however, kept Shriver in both 
jobs simultaneously.)<P>
What the public didn't know was that Shriver wasn't really quite a 
Kennedy--the family would never elevate him past a certain level, which he 
resented--and that his appointment must have needled Robert Kennedy, who 
was already feuding with Johnson. Kennedy had let it be known in December 
that HE was interested in running the War on Poverty, so, in picking 
Shriver, Johnson was turning down Kennedy, though the family tie was 
strong enough to ensure that Kennedy wouldn't criticize the appointment. 
In the longer range, both Kennedy and Shriver were interested in being 
Johnson's running mate in 1964, and by giving Shriver this high-visibility 
job Johnson seemed to enhance his chances of getting on the ticket.<P>
To the close observer, some strain was visible between Shriver and 
Kennedy. Shriver was closer to embodying the Kennedy legend, as it came 
together during 1964, than Robert Kennedy was. Kennedys were aristocratic, 
handsome, heroic. But Shriver was more aristocratic (coming from an old 
Maryland family), more handsome (conventionally, anyway, with his barrel 
chest and resolute chin and jaw), more heroic (he had a distinguished 
though unpublicized war record, having served four years in the Navy in 
the South Pacific). He was also more seriously Catholic and, unlike the 
Kennedys, came from the socially concerned wing of the Church; he was, as 
his father had been, a member of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. He 
had been in charge of civil-rights issues during the 1960 campaign, when 
the Kennedy inner circle had considered such issues secondary and a little 
sob sisterish. During the staffing of the Kennedy Administration, Robert 
Kennedy had pointedly refused to appoint Shriver's aide Harris Wofford as 
his assistant on civil rights in the Justice Department, because, as he 
said later, Wofford "was very emotionally involved in all of these matters 
and was rather in some areas a slight madman." Shriver and his wife had 
been interested in juvenile delinquency since the late forties, Robert 
Kennedy since the early sixties.<P>
A few days after the Kennedy assassination an aide came upon Lyndon 
Johnson in the Oval Office studying a notecard headed "What Bobby Thinks," 
which contained a list of Robert Kennedy's complaints about Johnson's 
conduct since the death of his brother. Johnson had kept Jacqueline 
Kennedy waiting on the ground for two and a half hours inside Air Force 
One in Dallas so that he could be sworn in as President; Johnson had been 
too quick in clearing President Kennedy's things out of the Oval Office. 
These were not rational complaints--they were born of grief, and it was 
somewhat embarrassing to Robert Kennedy to have them circulated--but it 
was useful to Johnson to know about them. Who told you this? the aide 
asked him. Sargent Shriver, Johnson said. So Shriver had signaled Johnson 
that he was not so blindly loyal to his brother-in-law that he couldn't 
help the new President.<P>
Shriver thought a little like Johnson. Though his background and Johnson's 
were entirely different, both came from families that had lost their money 
and both worked their way through college. Like Johnson, Shriver loved the 
application of the war metaphor to poverty--the idea of himself as the 
general in charge of managing, if not an actual war, at least something 
that belonged in the pantheon of grand successful American efforts. He 
used to tell the first head of community action to think of himself as 
running the Chevrolet division of General Motors. Shriver's mind, like 
Johnson's, automatically focused on what could get through Congress, and 
he instinctively thought big. Once, somebody was briefing him on what 
would become the Foster Grandparents program, which was a small part of 
the War on Poverty. Shriver broke in impatiently, "It's not big enough! 
Not big enough!"<P>
By the day after his appointment was announced, Shriver was at work with 
his staff, even though it was Sunday. Heller, Gordon, and Sorensen met him 
at Gordon's office to brief him on community action, which they envisioned 
as being all of the War on Poverty. As Johnson, at the ranch, had been, 
Shriver was immediately wary. In running a war, you had to produce 
victories, and it was hard to see how community-action agencies could be 
quickly perceived as successful. The premise that the activities of 
various government entities could be successfully coordinated by a 
neighborhood board was questionable. There had to be other ways to fight 
poverty. At one point Shriver and Adam Yarmolinsky, an assistant to Robert 
McNamara at the Pentagon, whom Shriver had asked to serve as his deputy, 
left to go to the men's room. There Shriver turned to Yarmolinsky and 
said, "It'll never fly."<P>
<BR>
All through the month of February, 1964, Shriver chaired meetings with 
government officials, academics, writers, activists, foundation 
executives, and even financiers, to plan the Economic Opportunity Act of 
1964, the legislation that would create the War on Poverty. These sessions 
surely represent a high-water mark for the essential quality, whether it 
was confidence or hubris, that characterized American society in the late 
fifties and early sixties. The Vietnam War did not represent nearly as 
great a departure from the usual activities of a world power as did the 
attempt to eliminate poverty in a capitalist country without giving poor 
people either money or jobs--and yet the people at Shriver's meetings had 
little doubt that they could do it. America could do anything. Even if one 
lacked faith in community action as the means, poverty, which hung on 
mostly in isolated pockets, could hardly be an insurmountable challenge. 
One evening during this period the diplomat George Kennan came to an 
informal seminar at Robert Kennedy's house and said that he had heard 
there was talk of eliminating poverty. Didn't everyone know, he said, that 
it was impossible to eliminate poverty, that no one in history had done 
it? Kennedy heatedly insisted that of course it could be done.<P>
There was in early 1964 (before the escalation of the Vietnam War) comity 
in the house of liberalism. Socialists like Michael Harrington and Paul 
Jacobs participated amicably in some of the planning sessions with 
Shriver, and were judged by the government insiders to be good-hearted and 
supportive, though of little help in formulating a program. The feeling 
that, as Daniel Patrick Moynihan put it later, "a big bet was being made" 
did not dominate the meetings, because most of the participants felt that 
as money was spread out across the country the War on Poverty would win 
friends in Congress, and they would be able to pump more money into the 
programs that worked best and scale back the failures. The economy was 
bountiful and would become more so after the tax cut went into effect. 
"For the proponents of social legislation, this was our Camelot," 
Yarmolinsky says.<P>
Because there was no sense that this was the last chance to get 
poverty-fighting right, there weren't great battles over the design of 
community action. According to one version of events, the community-action 
man on Kermit Gordon's staff at the Bureau of the Budget feared that 
Shriver might jettison community action entirely, and so got Hackett to 
persuade Robert Kennedy to prevail on Shriver to keep it. (Schlesinger 
accepts this version in Robert Kennedy and His Times.) But even if Kennedy 
had had that kind of clout with Shriver, community action wouldn't have 
needed it to survive. Shriver thought that community action was part of 
his charge from Johnson. "The only thing he gave me was community action," 
he says now. Also, he had great faith in experts, and all the experts said 
that community action was a great idea.<P>
Shriver and Yarmolinsky put their energies into broadening the bill. After 
his first briefing on community action Shriver called Richard Lee, the 
mayor of New Haven, to ask him about the Gray Areas project there. Lee 
said it was important not to overfund a brand-new community-action agency, 
because much of the money would be wasted. This strengthened Shriver's 
resolve not to spend all the money available to the War on Poverty on 
community action, as Heller and Gordon wanted to. In the bill he lobbied 
through Congress there were ten separate new programs. Community action 
was by far the biggest, but the one most important to Shriver was the Job 
Corps, which would take poor young men and women to wholesome camps and 
train them to join the work force.<P>
Shriver's immediate contribution to community action was to expand it, as 
a way of improving the War on Poverty bill's chance of passing, even while 
he was limiting its funding. Within a month of Shriver's appointment the 
plans called for not ten or seventy-five community-action agencies but 
many more; by 1967 there were more than a thousand. (Future poverty 
warriors should realize the folly of trying to fund a thousand independent 
local organizations, most of them new and run by inexperienced people.)<P>
Hackett and Lloyd Ohlin drifted away from the War on Poverty, having 
decided that community action had become so big as to be irredeemably 
distorted in conception. This left as the leading advocate of community 
action within Shriver's planning group Richard Boone, who had been 
Hackett's chief confederate at the Committee on Juvenile Delinquency.<P>
Boone was the most radical of the Kennedy Administration poverty fighters, 
but he was a radical in the Kennedy spirit. Compact, tough, with a 
piercing gaze and a crew cut, he had establishment credentials, such as a 
degree from the University of Chicago and a tour of duty at the Ford 
Foundation, but he came across as something more than a cosseted expert; 
he had been a captain on the Cook County sheriff's police force (granted, 
as an aide to a professor who had been elected sheriff on a reform 
ticket). He struck the people who worked with him as half revolutionary, 
half operator, a man to whom working in government was both a cause and a 
game.<P>
Unlike Hackett and Ohlin, Boone saw the War on Poverty as an opportunity 
to be seized, and he became a constant, terrierlike presence at Shriver's 
meetings, always pushing for language in the law that would ensure that 
poor people would be represented on the boards of community-action 
agencies. In one meeting he asked Yarmolinsky how many times he had to 
insist on what became known as "maximum feasible participation" by the 
poor before it got into the bill. "Oh, just a few more times," Yarmolinsky 
said. So Boone asked a few more times, and it was in.<P>
It had always been a part of the community-action creed that the poor 
should be consulted about their needs, so that they would get the proper 
government services. This would be a way to avoid what Robert Kennedy 
called planning programs "for the poor, not with them." Boone believed in 
this, but there were also other reasons for his idea about putting poor 
people on community-action boards. First, Boone believed that the cause of 
poverty was political as well as economic: when a community was poor, the 
reason was that it lacked power as well as money. Therefore, part of the 
cure for poverty was empowerment--training the residents of a poor 
neighborhood to organize themselves and learn to get things from the power 
structure. Maximum feasible participation was a way of turning the 
community
action boards into a power base for the poor.<P>
Second, Boone saw the course of community action as a struggle between 
poor people and social workers, whom he regarded with contempt. Unless 
some preventive action was taken, social workers would appropriate 
community-action agencies and infuse them with the "social-worker 
mentality," in which, for example, all juvenile delinquents were regarded 
as psychologically troubled and in need of professional help in order to 
become normal members of society. Boone saw maximum feasible participation 
as a way of hitting social workers where they lived, challenging them for 
control over the many social work jobs that community action and the rest 
of the War on Poverty would create.<P>
In the ghettos there was a hunger for good jobs. In most cities blacks had 
been effectively shut out of the skilled trades and higher-paying 
municipal-service work, which were the logical next step up the ladder 
from unskilled manual labor. Maximum feasible participation appealed to 
neighborhood pride, and it held out the promise of a new employment 
base--administering the War on Poverty and the other new domestic programs 
of the Johnson Administration. Over the next decade, as the related ideas 
of fighting poverty and neighborhood control of government social programs 
spread through federal, state, and local government, these new jobs became 
extremely important to the growth of the black middle class, although they 
didn't help the ghettos much as communities.<P>
In the Washington of 1964 the day when there would be black mayors of big 
cities seemed impossibly far off; therefore it appeared to be necessary to 
mitigate the influence of local government in order to bring the benefits 
of government--both services and jobs--to blacks. Circumventing existing 
political structures (not just the big federal departments in Washington 
but also city machines) was already part of the ethic of community action. 
Also, there was some fear among the planners of the War on Poverty that 
public officials in the South would make their local community-action 
agencies all white unless Washington had some specific way to prevent 
it.<P>
Most of Shriver's group, and certainly Shriver himself, failed to see that 
these areas of mild rebellion against the way things were usually done in 
politics would make the community-action program very unpopular with even 
stalwart Democratic politicians in the North. So much was being planned in 
February of 1964 that maximum feasible participation seemed like a minor 
point; for Shriver to have worried about its coming to dominate the War on 
Poverty would have been like an orchestra conductor's worrying that the 
piccolos might drown out the brass section. The loyalty to the national 
Democratic Party of the big-city Democratic mayors and the blue-collar 
constituencies they represented still seemed rock solid. Of the people who 
might create trouble for the War on Poverty, mayors and congressmen in the 
North ranked far behind Republicans, southern Democrats, and professional 
social workers, in the minds of the members of Shriver's inner circle.<P>
Today it seems obvious that community action was headed for political 
trouble. Politics then was more organized than it is now, but even now 
politicians don't like surprises. Spending federal money in the district 
of a congressman, the state of a senator or governor, or the city of a 
mayor will not automatically be popular with the official: he or she wants 
to know ahead of time who is going to get the money (preferably a 
political supporter) and to announce the grant personally if possible. In 
return for these favors, the local official should become a loyal defender 
of the federal program.<P>
Because community action broke all these rules, it eroded political 
loyalty to the War on Poverty. Much of what the community-action agencies 
did was popular. Probably the single most common activity of local 
community-action agencies around the country was running Head Start 
programs for preschool children, and Head Start was from the moment of its 
founding, in 1965, the best-liked of all the government's anti-poverty 
programs. Head Start was technically a part of the community-action 
program; so were other popular programs, like Foster Grandparents and 
Upward Bound. But the association did not help community action 
politically. It was always an uphill battle to draw attention away from 
the chief mechanism of the War on Poverty--the quasi-autonomous 
community-action agency--and toward programs like Head Start. Shriver 
didn't see, and perhaps couldn't have seen, what he was getting into.<P>
<BR>
<b>JOHNSON'S FIRST TROUBLED WAR</b><P>
It isn't really Shriver, who had never run for office, but Lyndon Johnson 
whom one would expect to have understood that the War on Poverty faced bad 
political problems. Johnson was a totally political man who had no 
hobbies, read no books, could barely sit through a movie: politics was 
virtually his only interest, and his fascination with it knew no bounds. 
He personally scrutinized the membership of even honorary presidential 
commissions. One of his Cabinet officers remembers going to see him on a 
Sunday at Camp David and finding him on the phone with a friend in Texas 
running down the results of local school-board elections there--just to 
relax, as it were.<P>
His ambition as President was a politician's ambition: he wanted in 
particular to pass a lot of legislation, and in general to unify the 
country to heal the divisions of geography and race and class that even 
FDR had failed to close. He wanted to set world records in politics, as a 
star athlete would in sports. "Get those coonskins up on the wall," he 
would tell the people around him. He pushed hard for the desegregation of 
5,000 southern school districts by September of 1965, and as the deadline 
approached he had an aide call the commissioner of education daily: How 
many more have you brought in--what's the count? On the day before 
Congress went on its Easter recess in 1965, when Johnson's lobbyists were 
sweating to finish up the many bills they were working on already, he 
called to say, "Well, can't you get another one or two yet this 
afternoon?"<P>
And yet Johnson had a streak of rebelliousness. He was not at all an 
organization man of politics--as, say, the late Mayor Richard Daley, of 
Chicago, was. He came from a one-party state where there was no tradition 
of slowly moving up through the ranks. He had done things in the service 
of his political ambition that he knew were wrong, and he knew that there 
were national problems that the political system would not ordinarily 
address. It was a point of pride with him in the first two years of his 
presidency, as it would not be for most politicians, that he was doing 
things that would hurt him politically. "Every day while I'm in office I'm 
going to lose votes," he told one aide. "I will probably lose about a 
million votes a month," he told another in the great days after the 1964 
election. Of all the things Johnson wanted to do, the one he wanted most 
to do was also the one he knew would be the most unpopular: help blacks. 
After the 1964 Civil Rights Act passed, he told aides, accurately, "I 
think we just gave the South to the Republicans." There was at times 
almost a recklessness to the way he spent his mandate. He submitted the 
fair housing act, the piece of liberal legislation that most terrified 
members of Congress, a few months before the 1966 midterm elections.<P>
Johnson's confident talk about losing support was not, however, based on 
seasoned self-knowledge. He was an extremely thin-skinned man who needed 
to be loved and was deeply wounded by criticism when it came. Even if he 
was prepared for attacks, it was for attacks of a certain kind: he would 
rile the old southern crocodiles on Capitol Hill, and Texans like John 
Connally, while winning over all the intellectuals and the liberals and 
the students and the blacks who had mistrusted him. He would pass the 
legislation they had dreamed of for decades--civil rights, medical care, 
aid to education--and they would love him for it. He might lose the South, 
but he would win over the North. Perhaps Johnson was constitutionally 
unprepared for the possibility that anyone might turn against him, but he 
was much more vulnerable, psychologically, to reproach from liberals than 
from conservatives, because leftward was the direction to which he was 
looking for approval.<P>
<BR>
The War on Poverty became embattled almost instantly. The Economic 
Opportunity Act of 1964 passed in August, creating the Office of Economic 
Opportunity, headed by Sargent Shriver, which would administer community 
action, the Job Corps, and most of the other programs that made up the War 
on Poverty. On January 20, 1965-
not yet half a year into the existence of the OEO--President Johnson 
received a confidential letter from Theodore McKeldin, the mayor of 
Baltimore, complaining about the community-action program and adding that 
the mayors of St. Louis, Cleveland, and Philadelphia didn't like the 
agencies in their cities either. At the end of 1965 several Democratic 
mayors set up a meeting in Miami just to grouse about community action, 
and Vice President Hubert Humphrey, whom one would have expected to be an 
ally of the War on Poverty, had turned against community action, because 
of his role as Johnson's liaison to the mayors.<P>
The most important enemy, by far, of community action among the mayors was 
Daley, who at the time was the single most powerful politician not just in 
Chicago but also on Capitol Hill, where he controlled the largest bloc of 
votes that would reliably move on one person's orders. He was crucial to 
Johnson's legislative program, and Johnson took great pains to keep him 
happy. Daley considered it essential to maintain total control of all 
politics and government in Chicago. He once personally saw to it that a 
small HEW grant to Martin Luther King, Jr., for a literacy program in the 
Chicago ghetto was canceled--after it had been publicly announced--because 
he considered it wrong for the federal government to put money into 
Chicago without going through him, especially when the recipient was King. 
To Daley, community action was the political equivalent of original sin. 
"You're putting M-O-N-E-Y in the hands of people who are not in my 
organization," he told Bill Moyers. "They'll use it to bring you down."<P>
"Many mayors assert that the Community Action Program is setting up a 
COMPETING POLITICAL ORGANIZATION in their own backyards," Charles 
Schultze, who had succeeded Kermit Gordon as budget director, wrote 
Johnson in September of 1965. To be more precise, they were worried about 
competing black political organizations. White backlash in the North, 
still blurry from the Washington perspective of 1964 and 1965, was 
perfectly obvious to the big-city mayors. Daley, who drove a car with the 
license plate 708-222 to commemorate the number of votes he got when he 
became mayor of Chicago, in 1955, saw his vote drop below 700,000 for the 
only time in his career in the 1963 mayoral election, and actually lost 
the white vote that year, because of his visible incorporation of blacks 
into his machine. Daley needed to hold on to Chicago's black voters, who 
were among his most dependably loyal constituents; the appearance in the 
ghettos of an independent black political force would not only threaten 
his black base but also cause white voters to panic and begin voting for 
candidates to the right of Daley. Like all the old-politics mayors, Daley 
thought that it was already enough of a struggle to keep the Democratic 
city organizations alive without Washington's stepping in to fund the 
opposition.<P>
Community action had political problems not just with the mayors but also 
in Congress. Most southern conservatives never liked any part of the War 
on Poverty. During the initial lobbying for the Economic Opportunity Act, 
Wilbur Mills, of Arkansas, told one of Shriver's aides that he was not 
going to be involved in any program to help "a bunch of niggers," and 
threw the man out of his office. White ethnic congressmen, men like Dan 
Rostenkowski and Roman Pucinski, of Chicago, and James Delaney and Hugh 
Carey, of New York, turned against community action, for the same reasons 
that the mayors did. And these were only the Democratic opponents of 
community action; Republican conservatives, especially mid-westerners and 
westerners, of course disliked it too.<P>
As the most visibly liberal government agency, the OEO was a frequent 
target of both the right and the left. Opposition to the OEO was one of 
Ronald Reagan's early political themes Adam Clayton Powell, who was the 
chairman of the House committee that authorized the OEO's funds, never 
thought that the agency was fully responsive to his concerns, and at one 
point he banned all OEO employees from his committee's offices. Richard 
Boone, who worked for the community-action program in the early stages, 
left in 1965 to start an organization called Citizens Crusade Against 
Poverty, whose purpose was to make sure that community action wasn't 
selling out.<P>
In the executive branch the OEO's main enemies were HEW and the Department 
of Labor. Wilbur Cohen tried repeatedly to get Johnson to abolish the OEO 
as an independent agency and to put most of its parts in HEW, where they 
would presumably be better managed and less visible. Willard Wirtz was 
opposed to the idea of community action from the start, opposed to the OEO 
as a separate agency, and positively enraged when he discovered that the 
big jobs program in the War on Poverty, the Job Corps, would be run by the 
OEO and not the Labor Department. He was given the Neighborhood Youth 
Corps as a consolation prize, but he still tried constantly to sabotage 
the Job Corps. Inside the OEO there was always the suspicion that the 
Labor Department's U.S. Employment Service, whose responsibility it was to 
screen people for the Job Corps, was sending along people with criminal 
records in order to make the Job Corps look bad.<P>
<BR>
All these officials were inevitable enemies of community action, who would 
create political trouble for the programs no matter how well they did out 
in the field. But out in the field there were problems too. Shriver hoped 
that the OEO, and especially the Job Corps, would loose an avalanche of 
favorable publicity, the way the Peace Corps had. He wanted the Economic 
Opportunity Act to pass in a blaze of glory, and successful anti-poverty 
programs to spring up immediately. Shriver agonized but went along when 
the North Carolina congressional delegation demanded that Shriver get rid 
of his deputy, Yarmolinsky, as the price of its support, probably because 
at the Pentagon Yarmolinsky had advocated the integration of public 
facilities near military bases in North Carolina. Having deprived himself 
of his key administrator, Shriver tried to produce administrative 
miracles. He insisted that 10,000 kids be enrolled in Job Corps camps by 
the end of June of 1965; his staff had them sleeping on the floors of 
gymnasiums to meet the quota. At the signing of the first batch of grants 
to community-action agencies--grants to more than 250 nongovernment 
organizations, most of them new and unproved--Shriver picked out one, the 
agency in Albemarle, North Carolina, and asked Fred Hayes, one of the 
people running community action, How do you know this one will work? It 
doesn't even have an executive director's name on the application. How do 
you know they won't pick someone incompetent? "I said, 'You don't know he 
won't be an incompetent,'" Hayes says today. "'He may well be. You can't 
control the grant recipients, and some of them are going to screw up.'"<P>
Some of them did, indeed, screw up. In Harlem, Adam Clayton Powell 
demanded a piece of the action at HARYOU, a project whose guiding spirit 
was the black psychologist Kenneth B. Clark; HARYOU became HARYOU-ACT, 
Clark resigned in protest, and almost from the moment it received its 
first OEO grant, of $1.2 million, in June of 1965, HARYOU-ACT was under 
investigation for financial irregularities. Even in Chicago, where Mayor 
Daley had been able, through Johnson's intercession, to keep the poverty 
program totally under his control, an internal OEO report circulated in 
May of 1965 showed that no books were being kept, that a subcontractor was 
working without a written contract, and that there was a one-to-one ratio 
of clerical to professional employees.<P>
At the Job Corps camps there were several embarrassing incidents of 
violence. At Camp Atterbury, in Indiana, one trainee was sodomized by 
several others. At Camp Gary, in Texas, five trainees held up and shot two 
enlisted men from a nearby Air Force base, and another trainee was stabbed 
to death outside a dance at the YMCA. At Camp Breckinridge, in Kentucky, a 
recruit shot a woman and then, while awaiting trial, managed to steal a 
car and ran into a family of four on the highway, killing them all. It 
became a joke among the OEO's lobbyists in Congress that they should tell 
every recalcitrant member that if he didn't vote right on OEO bills they 
would put a new Job Corps center in his district.<P>
Shriver was a dedicated man who drove himself and the people around him, 
but he reacted to the problems of the OEO more by emphasizing his 
strength, salesmanship, than by correcting his weaknesses, conception and 
administration. He invented citizens' support groups, like Athletes 
Against Poverty. He tried to hire Al Capp, the creator of Li'l Abner, to 
produce a comic book advertising the Job Corps. He barraged Johnson with 
memos, written with the specificity and enthusiasm of a professional 
publicist, claiming that the image of the OEO was turning around. In a 
typical passage he wrote, "I can't remember hitting five major American 
newspapers simultaneously on any program in recent years. An eight-column 
head in the Cleveland Plain Dealer certainly marks some sort of high 
point." From Shriver's perspective, the great problem of the War on 
Poverty was that it wasn't the kind of war he was used to fighting: it 
lacked public support, funds, and tolerance for error. Wanting and 
expecting to be a general, he found himself instead the operator of an 
unpopular social program.<P>
<BR>
<b>RETREAT AND SHIFTING GROUND</b><P>
In December of 1965 Johnson's chief aide for domestic affairs, Joseph 
Califano, prepared a detailed plan for dismantling the OEO, the first of 
several such plans to cross Johnson's desk. Soon afterward Johnson turned 
down a request by Shriver for an increase in the OEO budget from $1.75 
billion to $4 billion, and Shriver threatened to resign, backing down only 
when Johnson told him, "If you quit, we'll quit," meaning he would abolish 
the OEO. In 1967 the OEO nearly died when Congress missed the regular 
deadline to renew its appropriation. It survived only because of an 
amendment to the appropriation bill which gave elective public officials 
appointive power over a third of the seats on the community-action boards. 
The OEO is the great exception to the political-science maxim that 
government agencies are immortal. It never had any powerful friends and 
was at the edge of abolition almost from its founding.<P>
Most of the controversies that arose in the field operations of the OEO 
had a racial aspect. There were many community-action agencies, urban and 
rural, that led a relatively quiet existence; most of the best-publicized 
problems of the community
action program involved an agency in a black ghetto. The OEO was intended 
to be substantially aimed at the ghettos, but it was founded in ignorance 
of changes in the mood of American race relations which would be obvious 
within a year of its founding and would affect it deeply.<P>
Martin Luther King's strategy of seeking nonviolent confrontations with 
the often violent defenders of legal segregation in the South was not just 
morally right, it was a brilliant political strategy that played perfectly 
in the press and quickly persuaded white liberals (like the founders of 
the War on Poverty) that civil rights was an urgent cause. But black 
America--and the movement itself, for that matter--was never as 
Gandhi-like as King. Medgar Evers, the head of the Mississippi chapter of 
the NAACP until he was assassinated, in 1963, owned a gun. (Even King 
owned a gun during his early days in Montgomery.) John Lewis, the head of 
the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and now a congressman from 
Atlanta, had to be talked out of giving a speech at the 1963 March on 
Washington calling for a modern black version of Sherman's march through 
Georgia. King himself maintained relations with black-nationalist leaders 
like Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad, whom whites imagined to be 
antithetical to his cause.<P>
Freedom Summer, in 1964, which was portrayed in the national press as a 
love feast between white college students and the black movement, was 
actually somewhat tense. There was a feeling among blacks who had risked 
their lives over the past few years that the whites had swept in, taken 
over leadership positions, dominated press coverage, and, in the case of 
some white women, stolen men from the black women in the movement. The 
summer ended with Johnson's offering to seat only two members of the 
delegation from the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party at the Democratic 
National Convention, an experience that looked to Washington like a great 
civil-rights victory and to the civil-rights movement, especially the 
leaders of SNCC, like a crushing defeat. By the fall of 1964 discussion 
had already begun within SNCC about its becoming an all-black 
organization, which it did in 1967.<P>
All this was in the South. In the North church-based protest never had the 
galvanizing effect on black people that it did in the South, and ghetto 
poverty did not inspire the sympathies of whites in the way that 
segregation had. All through the middle sixties there were frustrating 
discussions within the movement about how to bring the struggle north and 
address the problems of the ghettos. The March on Washington was 
officially billed as the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and its 
chief organizer, Bayard Rustin, was annoyed that King's overpowering "I 
Have a Dream" speech effectively switched the focus from economic issues 
in the North to segregation in the South.<P>
The final great event of the movement was the Selma-to-Montgomery march, 
in 1965. In its wake Johnson said, "We shall overcome" before a joint 
session of Congress and proposed the Voting Rights Act. In June, Johnson 
in effect moved his rhetoric north, giving a commencement address at 
Howard University, in Washington, D.C., in which he called for "not just 
equality as a right and a theory, but equality as a fact and equality as a 
result."<P>
Then, later in that summer of 1965, over the space of two weeks, Johnson 
announced the commitment of American ground troops to Vietnam, and the 
Watts riots began. From that point on the little cracks and fissures in 
liberalism inexorably widened and deepened. The world Lyndon Johnson 
wanted to conquer came apart.

	<font size=5>E</font>arly in the winter of 1983, an unsettling story grew to prominence in 
American newspapers and on television newscasts: hundreds of homeless men 
and women were gathering in tents near Houston, Texas. Many among them 
were not solitary drifters but whole families driven to destitution. Over 
a few weeks, media attention on "Tent City" became so great that dwellers 
there were compelled to enlist one of their members as public-relations 
director, to fend off microphone-waving interviewers. Then, one day, a 
fire destroyed one of the tents, killing a man inside. The county fire 
marshal ordered the makeshift city abandoned, and it was. The story 
disappeared.<P>
Was this the early warning of a national problem? Around the time of the 
Tent City story, newspapers and newscasts carried reports claiming not 
only that homelessness was increasing at an ominous rate but also that it 
was reaching into the middle class. The Los Angeles Times, for example, 
warned that "the 'new homeless' are vastly different from those who have 
populated the nation's skid rows and tenderloins for the last 
half-century." The Boston Globe spoke of the "contemporary homeless," who 
embodied a "radical change" from the past.<P>
The New York Times referred to the "new poor"; USA Today to a "new breed" 
of homeless people. A Washington Post headline declared, "Middle Class: 
New Victims of Homelessness." These and other stories seemed to suggest 
that uncountable numbers of once-prosperous people would soon be wandering 
the streets. The beginnings of the nation's economic recovery may explain 
why this has not happened, but there is evidence that it was never likely 
to, even in the early winter of 1983, one of the gloomiest periods of the 
recession.<P>
Homelessness in this most affluent of countries is an undeniable reality. 
Estimates of the number of people left homeless range from half a million 
to 2 million nationwide; there are no exact figures, because those who 
lack mailing addresses cannot be accurately counted. In New York City, it 
is estimated that 50,000 people are homeless, and there are only 4,500 
shelter beds available to serve them; in Chicago, the estimate is 20,000, 
and there are only 1,000 shelter beds; in Phoenix, it is 3,000, and the 
city has no shelter beds at all. The Salvation Army, which generally comes 
to mind as the institution most concerned about the homeless, has a total 
of 28,376 shelter beds nationwide--obviously a scant number in comparison 
with the country's need.<P>
In the late fall of 1982 and the winter of 1983, the demand for these 
scarce facilities rose at a dramatic rate--in part, no one doubts, because 
of the economy. In Seattle, the emergency-housing department reported a 50 
percent increase over 1981 in the demand for shelter, and was turning 
hundreds away; in Boston, at least 200 people a night were sleeping on the 
floor of the city's biggest shelter because all the beds were taken. 
Shelters across the country experienced similar overflows. Yet, although 
the majority of the news reports about homelessness mentioned these 
problems, it was the "new homeless" angle--the idea that middle-class 
families were being tossed onto the street--that captured the most 
attention. And it is in this emphasis that the reports turn out to be, by 
and large, mistaken.<P>
<BR>
<BR>

The alarms about middle-class homelessness tended to be based chiefly on 
statistics compiled by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, the 
national trade group of mortgage lenders. The MBA's statistics, considered 
superior to those of any government-compiled source, are drawn from a 
quarterly survey of banks that together hold some 8 million home loans, or 
roughly a third of the total 27 million such loans that are 
institutionally written. Mortgage holders are at the core of the middle 
class. They have mustered enough economic success to handle the payments 
on their houses, but not enough to buy the houses outright; many live at 
the edge of their loans.<P>
Through 1982, the MBA's delinquency rate--the percentage of homeowners 
behind in their mortgage payments--rose. So, too, did a much more fearsome 
statistic: the "foreclosure inventory"--the percentage of home loans on 
which a formal foreclosure action has been taken. The foreclosure 
inventory in 1982 was the highest since the Depression.<P>
Clearly, many people last year were having problems with their mortgages. 
But did the MBA's statistics necessarily portend a dramatic increase in 
homelessness? Though the delinquency rate did worsen, it rose by only a 
fraction of a percentage point, from 6.35 percent at the beginning of 1982 
to 5.70 percent at the end. Moreover, inspection of the MBA's records 
shows that delinquency has risen frequently since 1960; for example, at 
the start of that year the rate was 2.22 percent, and at the end 2.66 
percent. The population has grown by 26 percent since 1960, but over the 
same period homeownership expanded by 68 percent; it is not surprising 
that people who have trouble affording a mortgage should have been 
included in the growing population of buyers. Nevertheless, the actual 
foreclosure statistics are not particularly frightening. Although this 
rate was, in truth, higher at the end of 1982 than at any other time since 
the Depression, it was only 0.67 percent, or one in 150 houses. At the 
beginning of 1982, the rate was 0.53 percent. In other words, the 
perception of a trend toward a new class of homeless people was based on 
an overall shift of 0.14 percent. Foreclosure inventories, like 
delinquency rates, have been rising since the 1960s, and they have been 
high in several years that were not considered to be periods of economic 
emergency. In 1964, for example, the foreclosure inventory was 0.41 
percent; in 1972, it was 0.52 percent.<P>
Of course, if you torture statistics, they will confess to anything. 
Stated as "0.67 percent," or "one house in 150," last year's foreclosure 
rate does not appear to warrant much concern. But stated as 180,900 
threatened households (0.67 percent of 27 million mortgages), the rate 
seems dangerous. To put these figures in perspective, it is necessary to 
know more.<P>
Few news stories mentioned that the MBA's mortgage survey is slanted 
toward government-backed Federal Home Administration and Veterans' 
Administration loans. Because FHA loans can be obtained with a small down 
payment, and VA loans with no down payment at all, they traditionally 
suffer higher delinquency and foreclosure rates than bank-backed, 
conventional mortgages. The MBA's foreclosure inventory on these 
conventional loans, which make up the bulk of the country's mortgages, was 
0.27 in the first quarter of 1982 and 0.39 in the last.<P>
Then, too, few stories mentioned that there are more houses in the U.S. 
without formal mortgages than with them. The 27 million outstanding 
mortgages cover not quite half of the 60 million single-family houses 
counted by the Bureau of the Census in 1981. Millions of houses are owned 
outright; their residents are in no immediate danger of being displaced. 
Also, millions of houses are financed informally by sellers; according to 
housing experts, sellers are far less likely than banks to attempt to 
foreclose on loans.<P>
Most important, few stories mentioned that foreclosures are not the same 
as evictions. The MBA speaks of a foreclosure "inventory" because houses 
whose mortgages are in foreclosure may remain in financial or legal snarls 
for years, during which time their owners continue in residence. Once the 
foreclosure starts, the owner might stall until his or her financial 
circumstances improve, re-finance the outstanding debt, or voluntarily 
sell the house to recover the investment. Unfortunately, there is no 
national statistic on the relationship between foreclosure and home loss, 
nor is there any national statistic on evictions. But Thomas Harter, the 
MBA's chief economist, says that his studies indicate that only between 30 
and 50 percent of all foreclosures begun are ever seen through. When the 
real-estate market is slack, bankers are more likely to let the owners of 
houses in foreclosure remain where they are, in hopes that the bank will 
eventually receive some payment, than to throw them out and risk getting 
nothing because no buyer can be found.<P>
Of course, someone who voluntarily sells a house to escape foreclosure is 
still losing it, and is surely suffering a loss in standard of living; the 
owner may even be starting on the downward spiral toward homelessness, but 
that fate is still some way off. Because the much-cited foreclosure 
inventory does not necessarily reflect home loss, some feel that a better 
measure of the condition of the middle class is the MBA statistic for 
foreclosures that are beginning. This figure, however, would not have 
served the "new homeless" analysis, because it hardly moved in 1982; it 
was 0.20 percent in the first quarter and 0.22 percent in the last. In 
fact, the rate of new foreclosures was higher during the recession of 1973 
and 1974, when it hovered at between 0.24 percent and 0.25 percent, than 
it was in 1982. This year, the rate is averaging 0.20 percent.<P>
<BR>
<BR>

Given the imprecision of the delinquency and foreclosure statistics, were 
there other ways to determine whether or not the "new breed" story was 
correct? Probably. One might have been the housing-vacancy rate. If 
middle-class people were, in fact, being driven to the streets in unusual 
numbers last year, apartments and houses should have been becoming vacant 
at a rapid rate. Vacancy statistics, however, do not show this. According 
to the housing division of the Bureau of the Census, home vacancy at the 
beginning of 1982 was 1.4 percent, and at the end it was 1.6 percent. 
Rental vacancies, likewise, changed little, beginning the year at 6.3 
percent and increasing only to 6.5 percent by the last quarter. In many 
cities where homelessness was said to be a special problem, vacancy rates 
were even lower: less than one percent for all dwellings in New York City, 
and slightly under 2 percent in Baltimore (where the estimate of homeless 
people runs as high as 8,000) and in Salt Lake City (with an estimate of 
1,000 people homeless).<P>
Various surveys conducted by emergency-service agencies in the fall of 
1982 provide no evidence of a surge in the numbers of middle-class 
homeless people. New York City's Human Resources Administration surveyed 
681 new arrivals at city shelters. Of this group, only 11.7 percent came 
because they had been evicted by a landlord, and no one had been evicted 
as a result of foreclosure. The Greater Baltimore Shelter Network found 
that 3.6 percent of the city's homeless were arriving because of 
court-ordered eviction from a house or rental apartment. The District of 
Columbia's Department of Human Services found that only 10 percent of the 
people in shelters were neither drawing payments from the federal Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children program (the welfare source most closely 
associated with painful need) nor eligible for them.<P>
A hearing held last December by the housing subcommittee of the House 
Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal housing law helped 
to catalyze the profusion of "new homeless" stories. This was the first 
congressional hearing on homelessness since the Depression year of 1933; 
thus it served as an obvious (and legitimate) news hook. The subcommittee 
presented as witnesses six homeless people, all from middle-class or 
near-middle-class backgrounds. Their testimony, eloquent and desperate, 
would have touched the hardest hearts. It became the centerpiece of many 
of the stories that played up middle-class home loss.<P>
Through the course of the hearing, the subcommittee also listened to 
forty-five expert witnesses--shelter operators, local housing officials, 
mayors, Salvation Army officers, community volunteers--all of them 
sympathetic to the plight of the homeless. Yet only one of these witnesses 
professed to believe that middle-class homelessness was a severe problem, 
and only a handful so much as mentioned the subject. Most spoke mainly of 
the expansion of homelessness among its traditional victims: the 
uneducated, the mentally ill, poor people who have never known wealth. The 
six homeless people who testified before the subcommittee about their 
plight were found and persuaded to appear by Mitch Snyder, a member of 
Washington's Community for Creative Non-Violence, a volunteer group that 
seeks to care for the dispossessed. Snyder says that he chose those six 
witnesses precisely because they were not typical of the 
homeless--because, owing to their backgrounds, they were willing and able 
to express themselves before Congress. But in the subsequent press 
reports, they were treated as typical. "The middle-class factor was the 
most attractive media angle, and everybody picked up on it," a 
congressional aide instrumental to the hearing says.<P>
In late winter, as temperatures fell and concern for the homeless 
increased, Congress appropriated $100 million in emergency aid, and the 
White House announced a new program: it would offer vacant federal 
buildings as temporary shelters. This announcement was a page-one story 
nationwide. Soon the Pentagon listed 565 buildings, most of them Army 
Reserve facilities in downtown areas, that cities could have largely for 
the asking. Exactly three of the 565 buildings were put into use. The 
federal Department of Housing and Urban Development offered 900 
structures, and only three of these were taken. "Most of the cities told 
us they either didn't have a problem or didn't want to deal with it," 
Gerald Kauvar, the director of the Pentagon shelter effort, says. Once the 
weather turned warm, and the economy seemed to improve, the reports about 
a homeless wave from the suburbs ceased.<P>
<BR>
<BR>

Though the middle class may not be in special jeopardy regarding a place 
to live, and though available shelters may be sitting idle, neither fact 
ought to suggest that homelessness is not an intolerable problem. It is. 
But to help the homeless, it is necessary to understand who they are.<P>
Many, of course, are victims of unemployment, though at the bottom of the 
job ladder, not on its middle rungs. Most studies show that the 
fastest-growing categories of new arrivals at city shelters are the young 
and women--groups that have the hardest time finding jobs in a contracting 
economy. For the young of all races and both sexes, the situation is 
particularly poignant. Many are going straight from childhood to street 
life, with no hope of a job, much less of a home to lose.<P>
Other homeless people are victims of government neglect and social-service 
cutbacks (and some of the cutbacks, it turns out, are as likely to be 
sponsored by liberals as by conservatives). Over the past two decades, 
many believe, more needy people have been left to wander the streets as a 
result of the "deinstitutionalization" of patients in state mental 
hospitals than for any other single reason. In 1955, 569,000 patients were 
cared for in state-run mental hospitals nationwide. By 1979, the total had 
fallen to 146,000. Since 1963, the Veterans Administration has cut back on 
its housing of mental patients by 59 percent, to 24,000 patients as of 
1980.<P>
Needless to say, the conditions in most state mental hospitals have long 
been dismal. It was in reaction to their bleakness that liberal 
politicians and legal foundations began to demand, via legislation and 
lawsuits, that the "warehousing" of indigent mental patients end and that 
the nonviolent mentally ill be released. In this demand, liberals found 
conservative allies, who favored the emptying of state hospitals as a way 
of reducing government expenses. But while "freedom" has been won for the 
mentally ill, it is often only the freedom to shiver on the street.<P>
"It is generally accepted that at least a third of the people now in city 
shelters have extensive histories of psychiatric hospitalization," Kim 
Hopper, a researcher for the National Coalition for the Homeless, told the 
congressional subcommittee. The chronically mentally ill have little hope 
of employment; many have slight awareness of what is going on around them, 
or even the capacity to take their medication, assuming some agency has 
managed to keep track of them to supply it.<P>
Finally, many of the homeless are victims not of the recession but of 
prosperity. They are outcasts of the urban rebirths of the 1970s, the 
former residents of rooming houses, or, as they are called by social 
workers, "single-room-occupancy" (SRO) hotels. When cities began to seek 
ways to attract the booming travel and convention industries, they needed 
space for large new hotels and convention centers. The developers 
naturally looked for whatever low-value property was obtainable, and that 
was often an SRO. As a result, in the past decade San Francisco has lost 
10,000 residential hotel units to urban renewal; New York has lost 31,000; 
the number of SRO hotels in Denver dropped from forty-five in 1976 to 
seventeen today. When SROs are demolished, their residents--who can barely 
afford to live in them as it is-
have no place to go. As an economic proposition, urban redevelopment makes 
sense, but, like many sensible economic propositions, it exacts a social 
cost.<P>
Community activists are finding themselves painted into a corner, obliged 
by their consciences to oppose job-enhancing developments and to favor the 
preservation of seedy flophouses. Groups in Portland, Oregon, for 
instance, have fought valiantly against development of the city's run-down 
Burnside district, a haven for alcoholics and panhandlers. The desire to 
PRESERVE a place like Burnside is nonsensical unless the interests of the 
potentially homeless are taken into account.<P>
Several federal programs to improve SROs and similar poverty-line 
dwellings exist, but the renovations are extremely expensive, considering 
what they achieve. The Department of Housing and Urban Development funds 
projects, but also demands that all HUD-sponsored work be done to its 
specifications, which are generous in intent but restrictive in effect. 
HUD typically requires that rehabilitation be "substantial"--that each new 
unit have a separate kitchen and bathroom, and other features to bring it 
near to a middle-class standard. The regulations also specify that all 
federally sponsored work be done in accord with the Davis-Bacon Act, which 
generally stipulates that construction workers be paid at the top of union 
wage scales. As a result, HUD-sponsored rehabilitations cost between 
$50,000 and $100,000 per unit, while privately administered projects cost 
about one tenth as much. HUD recently underwrote the renovation of an SRO 
in San Francisco, the Padre Hotel, at a cost of $80,000 per unit. In the 
process of meeting HUD codes, the number of units in the building was 
reduced from a hundred to forty-one, diminishing the poverty
level housing stock by fifty-nine in the act of preserving it. Another SRO 
hotel, the Aarti, in the same neighborhood of San Francisco, was improved 
without federal funds. The Aarti's renovation cost per unit is $8,000, and 
the total number of dwellings in the building will decline by only eight, 
from fifty to forty-two. The Aarti lacks some features of the Padre--for 
example, it has common kitchens while the Padre has one per unit--but it 
is in other respects the same. In Portland's Burnside district, one 
HUD-sponsored SRO renovation (the Butte Hotel) was granted a waiver from 
the usual standards--chiefly, the requirement that a bathroom be installed 
in each unit was dropped--and project costs fell from $40,000 to $9,350 
per unit. Of course, it would be ideal if all public housing could be 
improved to achieve HUD's standards, but this would also be prohibitively 
expensive. A by-product of this expense is that nearly all cities report a 
shortage of public or low-income housing, and long waiting lists to enter 
what housing is available.<P>
"If HUD would loosen the restrictions nationwide, we could save a vast 
amount of money and do more for the poor." Bradford Paul, the director of 
the North of Market Planning Coalition, a community group in San 
Francisco, says. The Reagan Administration came to office ideologically 
committed to the elimination of direct federal funding of public housing. 
Instead, the President has favored a system of housing vouchers (coupons 
that landlords would redeem as rent, and that, in theory, would give 
tenants the ability to choose their own housing, spurring market 
competition among landlords in the bargain.) "The last thing Reagan people 
want to do is create an efficient, government-subsidized construction 
program, because it would destroy their rationale for vouchers," Andrew 
Raubeson, the director of the Burnside Consortium, in Portland, says. For 
fiscal year 1984, the Administration is asking for only 15 percent of what 
the Ford Administration's last budget stipulated for housing, and is 
leaving HUD's rules, which are less cost-effective, in place.<P>
The provision of public shelters is ultimately a local issue, and local 
objectives vary. Some cities try to meet the problem; others leave it to 
private charities, such as church groups and the Salvation Army; many 
simply try to shift the problem somewhere else. When the homeless appear 
on the streets of Prince George's County, Maryland, a suburb of 
Washington, D.C., that operates no shelters, they are given bus or cab 
fare and told to go downtown. Phoenix recently "responded" to its growing 
burden of homeless people (some of them laid-off midwestern workers who 
have risked everything to look for jobs in the Sun Belt) by closing its 
three shelters, making it a crime to lie down on city land, and outlawing 
the plucking of food from garbage--all moves calculated to force the 
homeless elsewhere. Repelling the homeless is an attractive strategy 
politically, for it enables local officials to praise their own thrift and 
firm administration of public order while condemning the big
spending welfare bureaucracies of other cities. At the same time, local 
officials worry that humane treatment of the homeless could backfire. 
According to Ted Wilson, the mayor of Salt Lake City, communities fear 
that if they are the first to give the homeless decent care, they will 
quickly become a "blinking light," drawing in transients from around the 
nation and compounding existing problems. (New York is believed to have 
accomplished just that in the 1960s when it offered higher welfare 
benefits than other cities, and, whether or not the observation is true, 
it makes local officials jittery.) Without some uniform federal 
legislation to spell out a city's responsibility for the homeless, Wilson 
says, most communities will continue to avert their eyes.<P>
Reporters may have had the purest motives in playing up the troubles of 
the middle class, but, at the same time, they helped to direct the 
government's efforts to the least urgent part of the problem. A bill is 
advancing through Congress to provide $760 million in federal loans to 
help middle class families who are faced with foreclosure to keep their 
houses. While this idea has clear humanitarian and political appeal, the 
amount involved towers over the $100 million that Congress gave for the 
current fiscal year (and has voted to give again next year) to those who 
are truly desperate for shelter. If Congress passes this bill, it will be 
following a trend in federal entitlements--acting in the name of the 
needy, but providing the largest share of benefits to those who are 
relatively well off.<P>
Congress can find better ways to spend the money. Most cities have 
thousands of pieces of property, acquired through tax foreclosure, that 
sit rotting and unused. St. Louis, for example, has 9,000 empty 
tax-foreclosed dwelling units; nationwide, HUD owns some 170,000 abandoned 
dwellings. It is often said that while a new WPA-like agency might ease 
unemployment, there is no work for such an agency to do. Why not employ a 
federal work corps to renovate empty buildings for use as housing? The 
program would both create meaningful jobs and make decent again the 
communities where most of the unemployed live. Cities that rejected the 
Reagan Administration's offer of surplus federal buildings for use as 
temporary shelters--a palliative only--might feel very different about a 
permanent improvement in facilities for the poor.<P>
This idea has come before Congress more than once. Republicans run from 
it, because of their dread of new federal initiatives; having established 
that many federal programs were foolish, they believe that any 
social-service task that Washington undertakes must be wrong. Democrats 
run from the idea too, because unions oppose it. Unions say that anything 
done by a new WPA would steal work from their members. But what work? At 
the moment, there is hardly any work to steal in providing housing for 
those who really need it.

	<font size=5>R</font>epresentative Michael Synar, of Oklahoma, swears that this actually happened:

He was addressing a Cub Scout pack in Grove, Oklahoma, not far from his home

town of Muskogee. Synar asked the young boys if they could tell him the

difference between the Cub Scouts and the United States Congress. One boy

raised his hand and said, "We have adult supervision."<p>



<p>



Is anyone in charge on Capitol Hill? October's two-week-long melodrama over

shutting down the government was not an isolated instance. Recently Congress

voted for a $749 billion package of tax cuts, and only a few months later was

locked in debate over a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. The

House voted in favor of Ronald Reagan's plan to almost double the number of

nuclear warheads in the U.S. arsenal, and not long after voted in favor of the

nuclear freeze. Only once in the past six years has Congress finished the

budget appropriations before the beginning of the fiscal year; many spending

bills have not been completed until months after the spending they supposedly

control has begun. Long periods of legislative stalling are followed by spasms

in which bills are passed with wild abandon, and these often contain "unprinted

amendments" whose contents congressmen have never had an opportunity to read.

Many provisions of "tax leasing" became law that way, as, in 1981, did the

phone number of a woman named Rita. Rita's number had been scribbled in the

margin of the only copy of an amendment being voted on, and the following day

it was duly transcribed into the printed copy of the bill.<p>



<p>



"The system is a mess, and what's amazing is how many members of Congress are

fully aware that the system is a mess," says Alan Dixon, a senator from

Illinois. Congress has, of course, seemed out of control at many points in the

past. During the late 1930s, as signs of war grew, Congress was synonymous with

irresponsibility; during the McCarthy era, with cowardice. In 1959 it ground to

a halt over the minor issue of Dwight Eisenhower's nomination of Lewis Strauss

as secretary of Commerce and the even less important issue of an Air Force

Reserve honorary promotion for the actor Jimmy Stewart. Through the 1960s it

huffed and puffed about the Vietnam War, but never failed to approve funds for

the fighting. In 1972, after hours of acrimonious debate, it voted to raise the

federal debt ceiling for a single day. A degree of built-in vacillation was

part of the Founding Fathers' plan for the legislature. But have recent changes

in the structure both of U.S. politics and of Congress as an institution pushed

Congress across the fine line separating creative friction from chaos?<p>



<p>



"Congress today is a totally different institution from what it was when I

arrived, in 1961," says Morris Udall, of Arizona, one of the House's senior

members. "The magnitude of change is no illusion." The end of the seniority

system; the arabesque budget "process" and other time-consuming new additions

like the War Powers Act; the transformation from party loyalty to

political-action-committee (PAC) loyalty; the increased emphasis on media

campaigning; the vogue of running against Washington and yet being a member of

the Washington establishment; the development of ideological anti-campaigns; a

dramatic increase in congressional-subcommittee power and staff size, and a

parallel increase in the scope and intensity of lobbying--all are creations of

the past fifteen years. Some have served to make the nation's legislature more

democratic and to improve its contact with the public. Others have made

congressmen more frantic and timorous. But every change has in some respect

caused Congress to become more difficult to run. Right now there isn't anyone

in charge, and there may never be again.<p>



<p>



<br>



<b>EVERYWHERE A MR. CHAIRMAN</b><p>



<p>



Hardly anyone lamets the dismatling of the seniority rules--not even people

like Udall who would benefit if the old system still existed. From roughly the

turn of the century until 1975 rank was based solely on how many years a member

had been in Congress. The chairman of a committee could create or disband

subcommittees, choose the subcommittee chairmen (often choosing himself),

dictate when the subcommittees held hearings and whether bills were "referred"

to them, hire the committee staff, and exert total control over when the

committee itself would hold hearings or report bills to the floor. All these

powers rested exclusively with twenty to twenty-five men in each chamber;

others in Congress could wield power only by outvoting the senior members on

the floor, and then only when the senior members permitted such votes to

occur.<p>



<p>



Seniority had long been considered unassailable, for the reason that senior

members would use their powers to block any reform. But by the late 1960s the

resistance of the southern committee chairmen to the obvious need for

civil-rights reform had eroded seniority to the point at which challenges

became possible. Every two years, as a new Congress was convened and new

internal rules were passed, younger members would press for further

concessions. "In 1971 we managed to pass a resolution saying that seniority

would not be the sole criterion for chairmanship and that there ought to be a

vote," Udall explains. "It was vaguely worded and we didn't try to take the

issue any further. In 1973 for the first time, we held such votes. Every

chairman was retained, but it established the precedent--that there had to be a

vote. Then in 1975 we won."<p>



<p>



It was a pivotal year for the structure of Congress. Ninety-two new

representatives, mostly Democrats--the "Class of '74"--had been elected to the

House in the wake of Watergate. Government institutions in general were in a

state of low regard. Conservative southerners had been shamed by how long they

had stood by Richard Nixon; and two powerful old-school committee chairmen,

Wilbur Mills, of the Ways and Means Committee, and Wayne Hays, of the House

Administration Committee, were going off the deep end. The Class of '74

provided the extra margin of votes needed to end Seniority in the House. Three

entrenched chairmen--Wright Patman, of the Banking Committee, F. Edward Hebert,

of Armed Services, and W. R. Poage, of Agriculture--were overthrown. More

significant in the long run, a "subcommittee bill of rights" was passed.

Essentially, subcommittees won the right to hold hearings on any subject at any

time. Committee members would be able to "bid" for subcommittee chairmanships;

full committee chairmen could no longer control these slots or hold more than

one subcommittee chairmanship themselves. Each subcommittee chairman would get

funds for at least one staff aide who would work for him personally, not for

the committee. The total number of subcommittees would be expanded. A similar

though more genteel sequence of change took place in the Senate.<p>



<p>



The autocracy of the chair broken, Congress was transformed from an institution

in which power was closely held by a few to an institution in which almost

everyone had just enough strength to toss a monkey wrench. In 1964 there were

forty-seven meaningful chairmanships available in the House and Senate. Between

the dispersion of subcommittee posts and the increase in the total number of

committees and subcommittees, 326 Mr. Chairman positions were available in

1984. Allowing for those who hold more than one chairmanship, 202 of Congress's

535 members--38 percent--are now in charge of something.<p>



<p>



More than any other factor, the deregulation of subcommittees has increased

Congress's workload and decreased its cohesion. In 1970, before the change,

congressional committees held an average of twenty-three meetings a day. By

1982 the figure was thirty-seven meetings a day, and it remains at that level

today. Senators now average twelve committee and subcommittee assignments each.

With the trend toward "government in the sunshine" the number of closed

committee hearings has dropped substantially--from 35 percent of all hearings

in 1960 to seven percent in 1975. This serves the public's right to know but

also increases the amount of time congressmen spend posturing for public

consumption instead of saying what they think, which is practical only in

closed hearings. The subcommittee bill of rights established "multiple

referral," under which several subcommittees could consider the same bill or

topic. The result is increased redundancy, more speechifying, and almost

unlimited potential for turf fights.<p>



<p>



According to John Tower, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, "Our

committee spends a large proportion of its time trying to fend off competition

from other committees and monitoring what the other committees are doing." In

the Senate the Armed Services, Appropriations, Governmental Affairs, Budget,

Foreign Relations, and Veterans' Affairs committees all have an interest in

military legislation; subcommittees of the same committee may also have

overlapping jurisdictions, such as the Arms Control and European Affairs

subcommittees of Foreign Relations. Multiple subcommittees each with multiple

jurisdictions are a primary cause of the dizzy progression of non-events in

Congress. Headlines like SENATE MOVES TO BAN IMPORTS and HOUSE HALTS FUNDS

often- refer to subcommittee actions that will be modified many times before

they take effect or, more likely, vanish without a trace. Some sort of

milestone was achieved last June when both the International Economic Policy

Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the International

Trade Subcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee held hearings covering the

same topic--Japanese auto imports--on the same day, at the same time, with many

of the same witnesses.<p>



<p>



Driving the system is the unleashed desire of congressmen to be in command of

something--anything. Culture shock for new congressmen arriving in Washington

can be severe. Having just won a grueling electoral test and bearing the status

of big wheels at home, in Washington they discover that they are among

thousands of potentially important people competing for influence and

attention. Young congressmen also find themselves assigned to cramped, dingy

offices with Naugahyde furnishings and no majestic view of the Capitol dome.

The yearning for a Washington badge of recognition and the additional

perquisites that would make Capitol Hill life what they imagined it to be can

set in almost immediately. <p>



<p>



A chairmanship is particularly important because television is permitted in

hearing rooms. Almost from the onset of television, congressmen have realized

the promotional potential of the carefully scripted hearing: the McCarthy and

Kefauver hearings of the 1950s, which were among the first "television events,"

made their eponyms famous.<p>



<p>



Fame may be an elusive goal, but publicity is not. The proliferation of

networks and newscasts meshes perfectly with the proliferation of Capitol Hill

hearings. Congress itself is difficult for television to cover, because no

single person is in charge and few actions are final. A well-done hearing, in

contrast, has a master of ceremonies, a story line, and an easily summarized

conclusion when a witness commits a gaffe, announces a "policy shift," or

clashes angrily with committee members. Hearings, unlike floor action, also

allow congressmen to introduce props--the masked witness being a perennial

favorite, piles of money or gimmicks like chattering teeth being reliable

avenues to television coverage.<p>



<p>



Once created, a subcommittee takes on a life of its own, if for no other reason

than that the staff must justify its existence. In 1970 the House Committee on

the District of Columbia had fifteen staff members; today it has thirty. The

Senate Rules Committee had thirteen staff members in 1970 and today has

twenty-seven. The House Appropriations Committee has more than twice as many

staff members as it had in 1970, and the Merchant Marine and Fisheries

Committee's staff has risen from twenty-one to eighty-nine. Debra Knopman, a

former staff aide to Senator Daniel Moynihan, says, "The staffs are so large

everybody wants to have his say and leave his own little stamp. Pretty soon the

weight of people wanting attention becomes greater than the force moving the

legislation, and the whole thing grinds to a halt."<p>



<p>



Staff allegiance is to the subcommittee chairman rather than to the overall

purpose of the legislature, and bickering with members of other staffs becomes

a primary means of self-advancement. While the top jobs in congressional

offices pay well--$46,000 to $56,000 a year--the average pay is only $25,000;

between the low salaries and hectic working conditions, turnover in

congressional offices runs at a rate of 40 percent a year. A staff of bright,

inexperienced people will work harder and produce more good ideas per salary

dollar spent than an older, trained staff, but it will also lack an

institutional memory, demand more attention, and make more mischief, mostly in

the form of turf fights.<p>



<p>



The proliferation and redundancy of committees has produced a proliferation of

redundant committees to study dhe problem. In the past decade the Senate has

appointed three internal-reform study groups: the Stevenson Committee (named

after the former Illinois senator Adlai Stevenson III), the Pearson-Ribicoff

Study Group (run by retired senators James Pearson, of Kansas, and Abraham

Ribicoff, of Connecticut), and a committee now meeting under the chairmanship

of Senator Dan Quayle, of Indiana. Stevenson recommended a simplified system

that would combine overlapping committees. Pearson and Ribicoff recommended

that all subcommittees be abolished; that committees like the Small Business

Committee and the Select Committee on Aging, which exist mainly to mollify

interest groups, be subsumed into larger committees; and that the pairs of

committees most frequently at each other's throats--the Armed Services and

Foreign Relations committees, and the Budget and Appropriations committees--be

merged.<p>



<p>



None of the major Stevenson or Pearson-Ribicoff recommendations were enacted.

The feudalistic system may prove in the long run more resilient than the

seniority system, because now the number of congressmen with a sake in

preventing change is much greater. Merging the Armed Services and Foreign

Relations committees, for example, would eliminate one of the glamorous "A"

committee chairmanships that are tickets to instant prominence, to say nothing

of eliminating about ten subcommittee chairmanships. When Howard Baker, the

retiring majority leader, appeared before the Quayle committee last July to

present a summing up of his years of leading the Senate, only two senators were

present to hear him. All the rest had schedule conflicts.<p>



<p>



<br>



<b>THE BUDGET THAT WOULDN'T DIE</b><p>



<p>



The way Congress spends money was converted into a "process" with the passage,

in 1974, of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act. Its immediate

purpose was to prevent Richard Nixon from "impounding," or refusing to spend,

money that Congress had appropriated. But the Budget Act also had a long-term

goal: solving a structural defect in Congress's spending machine.<p>



<p>



Before 1974 the House and Senate each had three kinds of committees involved

with the budget: authorizing, appropriating, and revenue. The authorizing

committees, like Agriculture, Transportation, Energy, and Interior, are the

most familiar; they "authorize" federal activity by writing legislation in

their subject areas. But though they can start or end programs, they cannot

approve expenditures--only the two appropriating committees can do that. Since

the amount spent on a program usually determines that program's effect on

policy, the potential for overlapping and disputation is boundless. Neither

authorizing nor appropriating committees, meanwhile, have the power to raise

the money that backs up the checks--only the Finance Committee, in the Senate,

and the Ways and Means Committee, in the House, do. Because of this separation

it became all too easy for authorizing and appropriating committees to ignore

the fiscal consequences of their actions--getting the money was somebody's

else's job--and for the revenue committees, in turn, to demand that the other

fellow crack down on spending.<p>



<p>



During the 1950s and 1960s, when deficits were relatively stable, this state of

affairs was tolerable. According to Robert Giaimo, who served in the House from

1958 to 1980 and was the Budget Committee chairman in the late 1970s, "No one,

including myself, in Congress in the 1960s ever asked what anything would cost.

All we thought about was, Does this sound like a good program? Can we get it

through?"<p>



<p>



The budget process was intended to bring together the questions of how much to

spend, how to spend it, and where the funds would come from with a single

resolution that would both guide Congress and impose a series of spending

ceilings to control the deficit. Congress would have, say, a certain ceiling

for transportation, and if it wanted to add funds to subway construction, it

would have to remove a like amount from highways.<p>



<p>



Ideally this would have been accomplished through some merging of the

authorizing, appropriating, and revenue committees. But merger would have

required that at least two powerful chairmen, plus many subcommittee chairmen,

surrender their posts. So an entirely new procedural tier, the budget

committees, complete with two important new chairmanships, was set on top. The

result is what Howard Baker calls "a three-layer cake." In theory, on receiving

the President's budget requests, in early winter, the budget committees quickly

produce a nonbinding first resolution to set general ceilings. Then the

authorizing committees write policy-setting legislation within those ceilings,

and the appropriating committees--after learning of the authorizing committees'

policy objectives--award the money. Near the end of this cycle the budget

committees produce a second resolution to reconcile the inevitable differences

between what the budget ceilings allow and what the committees are actually

spending. This resolution is binding, and after it is passed, in theory the

remaining pieces fall smoothly into place.<p>



<p>



In practice the budget process isn't working anything like that. Budget

resolutions have become the subjects of such contention that this year the

first resolution, due on May 15, wasn't passed until October 1--even though it

was nonbinding. Appropriating and authorizing committees work concurrently and

nearly year-round, the appropriating committees choosing dollar amounts before,

from the standpoint of policy, they know how the money will be used. The Budget

Act breaks down spending into functional categories different from those

employed by the committee structure, so when a budget resolution is being

debated, wrestling goes on over which portion of which ceiling should apply to

which committee, a procedure known as "crosswalk." Thus the process leads to a

continuous frenzy of activity but few decisions that count.<p>



<p>



In order to prepare the fiscal 1984 defense budget, the Senate Appropriations

Committee held seventeen days of hearings, producing about 5,300 pages of

testimony. The Senate Armed Services Committee held twenty-seven days of

hearings on the defense budget and called 192 witnesses, many of whom also

appeared before the Appropriations Committee to make the same statements. The

Senate Budget Committee held hearings on the subject as well, producing two

resolutions that had to be debated and voted on by the full Senate.<p>



<p>



Meanwhile, in the House, the Armed Services, Appropriations, and Budget

committees were duplicating this work, and the full chamber was voting on a

different budget resolution. And none of it was final.<p>



<p>



When the defense bill itself came to the Senate floor, it sparked weeks of

debate; the (different) House bill caused a similar swirl on the floor. Even

after that the defense budget wasn't finished. A House-Senate conference

committee had to be created to resolve the discrepancies between the two

versions, and then the conference-committee bill had to be debated and voted on

by both chambers. Spending levels for the Defense Department weren't finally

set until mid-November of 1983, seven weeks after the fiscal year had begun.<p>



<p>



Last summer Howard Baker was negotiating simultaneously with various factions

on the defense authorization bill and the defense appropriations bill and with

a House-Senate conference committee deadlocked on the defense sections of the

budget resolution. In other words, he was trying to arrive at three different

versions of the same number--none of which would be final. "This is crazy,"

Baker told the Quayle committee, in a plaintive tone. "It makes absolutely no

sense."<p>



<p>



The endless budget deliberations have also been a driving force behind a

dramatic increase in the number of recorded votes on the floor. In 1960 the

House staged 180 roll-call votes, or 0.7 votes per working day. In 1970 there

were 443 votes, or 1.3 per working day, and in 1980 there were 1,276 votes--3.9

each day. (In the Senate roll calls have increased from 1.5 a day in 1960 to 3

a day in 1980.)<p>



<p>



The sheer logistics of staging four roll-call votes a day are imposing, because

congressmen are rarely on the chamber floor, or even in the Capitol. When

roll-call votes are signaled, congressmen must drop what they are doing

(usually attending committee meetings at one of the congressional office

buildings several hundred yards from the Capitol), race to the floor, vote, and

race back. It is considered political suicide to miss roll-call votes, even

when the subjects are trivial (in recent years the House voted 305 to 66 to

establish Mother-in-Law Day and 388 to 11 to permit the International

Communication Agency to distribute a slide show called Montana: The People

Speak) or when the votes are likely to be overturned later. Since low

attendance has an instant negative connotation, one of the easiest ways for a

challenger to attack an incumbent congressman is to hammer at a "bad attendance

record" on floor votes--a tactic that avoids the issue of whether the

congressman might have made more meaningful use of his time.<p>



<p>



Because of the regularity with which redundant floor votes occur, Congress

"never finishes anything, never arrives at a decision," according to Senator

Ted Stevens, of Alaska. "Always they are just preliminary decisions that will

be addressed again later anyway. It's totally confusing to the public, and even

to ourselves." By my count there have been thirty-six "test votes" in the House

and Senate on the MX missile since Reagan took office, most of them

necessitated by some whorl of the budget process. These test votes have been

accompanied by tension, packed press galleries, ringing debate--all the drama

of decision, but no decision. On a Tuesday in December of 1982 the House worked

late into the night debating whether to cut nearly $1 billion from MX funding.

The vote was headline news nationwide and was played as HOUSE KILLS MX. Then,

on Wednesday--THE FOLLOWING DAY--the House voted to retain $2.5 billion for MX

research and development.<p>



<p>



The MX IS far from unique as a source of marathon voting. In 1981 the Senate

staged twenty-five roll-call votes on the budget-reconciliation bill (an

interim step) and fifty-five on the tax-cut bill. In 1983 there were eight

Senate roll-call votes on what language to use in condemning the Soviet

destruction of Korean Air Lines flight 007. During three months in 1983 the

House took twenty-seven recorded votes on the nuclear freeze, including eleven

in one week.<p>



<p>



Often in recent years the United States has technically not had a budget at all

but rather has operated under a "continuing resolution" that keeps the money

flowing but avoids an official legislative confrontation over the deficit.

Continuing resolutions are popular, in part because they are one of the

mechanisms that allow congressmen to seem to be voting for both sides at once:

they can vote No on the budget itself ("I'm opposed to these deficits") and

vote Yes for individual programs on the continuing resolution ("I brought

increased federal spending to this district"). Similarly, the frequent votes to

raise the federal debt ceiling are technically "temporary" legislation, so that

congressmen can claim that each vote was merely for an emergency stopgap, not

an endorsement of the debt itself. A temporary vote results in the need to have

another showdown over the same subject a short time later, even though it was

known all along that the "temporary" increase would not provide enough time to

make substantial reforms in spending practices. "We are forever staying up all

night to extend the debt one month, doing nothing for a month, and then staying

up all night again," says a highly placed officer of the House.<p>



<p>



In recent years there also has been an increase in the use of supplemental

appropriations bills, which are in effect end runs around the stagnated budget

process. A case study in how Congress now works is this year's summer-jobs

supplemental. In March of 1984 the House overwhelminglv passed a bill providing

$60 million in emergency aid for African drought victims. The bill was sent to

the Senate, where immediate passage was expected. Realizing this, Senator

Dixon--who had been looking for means to enact a $100 million increase in

federal summer-jobs funding for high-unemployment states like his,

Illinois--decided to attach his proposal as an unrelated amendment, or "rider,"

to the famine-relief bill. (In the House, amendments must be germane; there is

a similar rule in the Senate, but it is rarely enforced, meaning that in effect

any rider can be attached to any piece of legislation.) In early April, Dixon's

jobs amendment was added to the relief bill without opposition. <p>



<p>



All aboard! The train was about to leave the station. A noncontroversial

philanthropic bill--who could be against food for drought victims and summer

jobs for youth?--was ideal as a carrier of baggage. Within ten days the Senate

had attached no fewer than thirty-five more riders to the bill. Among them were

$14 million for the Cumberland Gap Bypass Tunnel; $5 billion for the Commodity

Credit Corporation; $845 million for two child-nutrition programs; $2.3 billion

for the Rural Housing Insurance Fund; $850,000 for recreation in Nassau County,

New York; $70 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, providing

"that none of the funds appropriated under this paragraph shall be used to pay

for receptions, parties, and similar forms of entertainment"; $1 million for

abandoned-mine reclamation grants for Montana; $50 million for crop insurance;

$25 million for United States Customs Service airplanes; $62 million for

military aid to El Salvador; $21 million for aid to the contras in Nicaragua;

extra money for the Senate Stationery Revolving Fund; and a "sense of the

Senate" section praising the Navy's Seabee construction teams as "elite units

of unprecedented mobility and versatility."<p>



<p>



Soon the House made known that it wanted the Senate to drop all the riders,

including the summer-jobs provision; Jamie Whitten, of Mississippi, the House

Appropriations Committee chairman, said that the Senate had "overstepped its

prerogatives"--that is, gone wild. Then the mining of Nicaraguan harbors by

contra forces was revealed and became a media event. Congressmen began to

compete to see who could express the most outrage, even though Congress had

supplied the funds with which the mining was carried out. Talk increased of

using certain provisions of the War Powers Act, which would set in motion

another new "process." Passed in 1973, the act was catalyzed by Nixon's

"secret" bombing of Cambodia and invasion of Laos, but its origins go back to

President Truman's decision to commit U.S. troops to Korea without consulting

Congress and to President Johnson's use of trumped-up evidence to trick

Congress into passing the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. The War Powers Act creates

a sequence of deadlines that so far have served mainly to generate meetings,

testimony, and the appearance of action; its serious provisions, involving the

withdrawal of troops, have never been acted upon.<p>



<p>



During the harbor-mining flap, the House held ten hours of floor debate on an

anti-mining resolution, not because there was any doubt about the outcome--the

resolution won 281 to 111--but because so many members wanted a chance to make

a speech with the cameras rolling. The Senate also held a long-winded debate

before voting 84 to 12 to condemn the mining. The votes were headline

news--even though neither was a decision but merely a nonbinding expression of

concern. This "done," Congress adjourned for the Easter holiday.<p>



<p>



By mid-May the House had passed a new version of the famine bill, removing some

of the Senate riders. A conference committee was called to resolve the

differences, especially over the now controversial aid to El Salvador and the

Contras. In early May, Jose Napoleon Duarte was elected president of El

Salvador. He met with House leaders and persuaded them of his sincerity, and

House objections to the $62 million in extra aid for his country were dropped.

But the $21 million for the Contras remained in dispute. White House lobbyists

said that they would not support the bill unless aid to the Contras was

included. Stalemate was reached. Famine relief and the summer-jobs measure were

now being held up by a political non sequitur.<p>



<p>



In mid-June, Dixon appeared before the Senate's Democratic caucus with a

spending breakdown showing that although the jobs measure was intended mainly

for industrial states, almost every state--forty-four of fifty--would get some

share of the money. This seemed to increase senatorial enthusiasm. Then, at a

televised press conference, President Reagan was asked whether he felt that

employment for the poor should depend on aid to the Contras. Reagan seemed only

dimly aware of what was at issue, but the question had been phrased in such a

way that he came off sounding hard-hearted. A spate of bad publicity resulted,

including editorials in most of the nation's papers.<p>



<p>



In late June there was another round of floor debate in the Senate. Aid to the

contras was dropped from the bill, as were a few of the other riders. When

finally approved, the supplemental, which had started with a single provision

worth $60 million, contained twenty-two provisions worth $1.1 billion. Reagan

signed it on July 2--with the intended summer-jobs recipients already well out

of school, and an unknown number of African drought victims, if anyone still

remembered them, added to the death toll.<p>



<p>



<br>



<b>MOUNTAIN PEAKS</b><p>



<p>



When seniority was in flower, the personal prospects of most congressmen were

limited. There was nothing a congressman might do to speed his ascendancy to

the chairmanship of a committee. He could only wait. If he wished to be able to

deliver appropriations for his district or constituency, his best chance lay in

cultivating the good will of a few older chairmen and leaders--the speaker, the

majority and minority leaders and their assistants, and the party caucuses,

which made and revised committee assignments.<p>



<p>



The main way to win the favor of this small group was to keep quiet. Make no

special demands, vote as directed, and never challenge a leadership position or

a senior chairman's bill on the floor. Challenging the power structure might

work on occasion--but the senior members were around for the long haul, and

they had excellent memories for those who crossed them. Stepping out of line

might also cause a congressman to lose the financial support of his party, and

that might cost him his job.<p>



<p>



As the tenor of American politics changed--and as, through Watergate, internal

Washington came to be associated with disgrace rather than dignity--Congress

changed. "Today each senator is his own mountain peak, with his own staff, his

own source of financing, his own pet issues, and his own agenda," says Nelson

W. Polsby, the author of several standard texts on Congress.<p>



<p>



With the seniority system gone, the rewards of patience are fewer--there's no

guarantee that playing by the rules will lead to a prominent position. The

prominent positions themselves have been devalued, and the penalties for being

a glory-seeker have been all but eliminated.<p>



<p>



At the same time, with the expansion of television coverage, playing to the

crowd has become much more rewarding than playing to the club. In 1964, 1,649

journalists were accredited to cover Congress. Today 3,748 are: seven

journalists for each congressman. By far the largest increase has been in the

number of radio and television journalists. While Congress itself is diffficult

for the networks to cover, individual congressmen make ideal subjects for

television. They hold important positions; they speak in catchy phrases that

clip into twenty-second bites; they eagerly seek exposure, and thus are willing

to cooperate with television's requirements; and they have opinions on nearly

everything. Congressmen, in turn--particularly senators, because of their extra

prestige--have found that they can use television to cultivate national

followings that will supply them with fame, donations, and a power base, should

they run for President. Self-promotion has always been a factor in Capitol Hill

affairs, but the advent of television has made it convenient to a degree never

before possible.<p>



<p>



The shift. in campaign financing toward direct mail and PACS has an obverse

effect that is often overlooked: the shift away from political-party structures

as a source of funds. In 1982 candidates for the House received, on average,

only six percent of their funds from Democratic or Republican party

organizations. Almost all their money came from PACS and from individuals, most

of whom were PAC-affiliated or solicited by direct mail. Oil-company PACS alone

gave more money to Democratic candidates in 1982 than did the Democratic

National Committee. Party discipline has always been weak in U.S. politics;

there is nothing in the United States that rivals the bitterness and intensity

of Western European party feuds, for example. The two restraints that

congressional leaders have traditionally used on members are the promise of

campaign funds and the threat of seniority freeze-out: with the former now more

readily available outside Congress and the latter lacking credibility, mountain

peaks are heaving up in every direction.<p>



<p>



This change affects the substance of government as well as the style of

Congress. Subcommittee hearings held primarily to showcase the chairman waste

not only the subcommittee members' time: someone must testify at those

hearings. Secretary of State George Shultz was called to Congress for formal

testimony twenty-five times in 1983, or every other week; all told, high State

Department officials made nearly 400 appearances. Senator Robert Kasten, of

Wisconsin, says that officials appearing before redundant committees not only

discuss the same topics but use the same words. "Often I'll say to myself,

Where have I heard that before? and realize that it's the exact same speech

that was read by the same man, the week before, at another hearing. If you miss

part of his speech, just go to the next hearing, because he'll be giving it

again."<p>



<p>



Constantly going up the Hill to testify--and constantly having to defend budget

requests, which in the multi-tier system are subject to some kind of challenge

somewhere almost daily--affects the efficiency of executive agencies.

Administration officials come to view a good day of committee testimony as

representing the successful fulfillment of their duties. This is an essential

element of Washington make-believe. In turn, congressmen often view an

official's relations with Congress as in itself the measure of success (it was

Anne Gorsuch Burford's refusal to release documents to Congress, not her

policies at the Environmental Protection Agency, that caused her downfall). And

reporters come to view accessibility to the press as the chief test of an

official's worth. The question of what government is actually doing is often

lost in the shuffle.<p>



<p>



<br>



<b>PRISONERS OF TRIVIA</b><p>



<p>



Trivia, even to the most dedicated Congressman, has its pull. When there are a

thousand small things that demand attention--hearings, floor votes, hands to

shake, parties to attend, and speeches to deliver--the mind tends to focus on

them, and larger purposes are forgotten.<p>



<p>



The development in the 1970s of computerized direct mail, for example, may have

given congressmen a powerful new tool with which to raise money, but it also

gave interest groups a powerful new tool with which to bury Congress in trivia.

In 1972 members of the House received 14.6 million pieces of mail; last year

the figure was 161 million, and this year mail is running at a rate of 200

million pieces. That comes to 459,770 pieces of mail for each representative.

On a single day this fall Tip O'Neill, the speaker of the House, received FIVE

MILLION pieces. One staff aide, who worked for Hubert Humphrey in the 1960s and

now works for one of the Senate's lesser-known members, recalls, "During the

height of the debate on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Humphrey got 3,000

letters. This was considered astonishing. Now we can get 3,000 letters a day

even when there's nothing going on."<p>



<p>



Most of the letters are sparked by mass-mailing campaigns made possible by

computers and targeted address lists: it is not unusual for a congressman's

office to receive in one day fifty handwritten letters all of which have

exactly the same wording. But the fact that few of the letters are spontaneous

does not diminish their importance to congressmen; each letter represents both

the concerns of a citizen and a lost vote should the congressman fail to reply.

Failing to answer a letter--even with a form letter--is riskier than missing a

roll-call vote, since the letter constitutes the most direct contact the

average voter will ever have with a political leader.<p>



<p>



"People write to us to complain about the expansion in congressional staff,

then get mad if someone isn't standing by to answer their letter," says Janet

St. Amand, the legislative director for Representative Thomas Carper, of

Delaware. Form-letter computers that spew out paragraphs in response to key

words have been installed in congressional offices, and the offices of senators

from large states now more closely resemble mail-order outlets than legislative

enclaves. Senator Dale Bumpers, of Arkansas, was embarrassed a few years ago

when it was revealed that his computer contained a form letter designated "late

apology to friend" that began, "It was good to hear from you, and I hope you'll

accept my apologies for my delay in getting back to you. I had put your letter

aside to answer personally...." Capitol Hill interns and lower-level staffers

now find that their lives consist almost entirely of opening letters,

flattening the contents, and stuffing envelopes with the responses.<p>



<p>



Robert Rota, the postmaster of the House, says he sees no end in sight for the

increase in congressional mail: "The stamp will always be the cheapest form of

lobbying, and as long as the enthusiasm for lobbying keeps building, so will

the volume of mail."<p>



<p>



One new distraction that members of Congress dare not complain about publicly,

but nonetheless feel, is the physical presence of constituents in Washington.

The increase in travel by average Americans is among those measures of

society's wealth that do not fit neatly into the consumer price index but are

unmistakable. In 1970, 2.8 million people visited the Capitol grounds; the

figure continued to build even through the recent recession, and in 1983 it hit

five million. Crowds are such that it is now sometimes difficult, even during

the week, to walk through the Capitol Rotunda; in the summer, tourists even

abound in the unmarked (purposely, to discourage the curious) underground

passageways that link the functional parts of the Capitol.<p>



<p>



When the Philip Hart Senate Office Building was completed, two years ago, there

was a minor revolt among senators who were ordered to move in, in part because

the Hart Building lacks the traditional unmarked doors that allow senators to

slip in and out of their private offices unnoticed.<p>



<p>



<br>



<b>THE CAMPAIGN THAT NEVER ENDS</b><p>



<p>



Along with the shift from seeking success within Congress as an institution to

seeking national attention and interest-group financial backing went a shift in

corporate campaign contributions in the 1970s--away from incumbents and toward

challengers.<p>



<p>



The great bulk of business contributions had always gone to sitting

congressmen, even liberal Democrats, on the "bird in the hand" theory. During

the 1970s, as seniority broke down, conservative chairmen lost their ability to

control liberal younger members, who at times seemed out of touch with the

reasonable requirements of business. Concurrently, oil companies were finding

both that they had huge sums of money at their disposal and that they were

under political attack, by means of the windfall-profits tax and other

measures. Having the money to spend and the desire to spend it, oil companies

broke tradition and began to funnel money to challengers; they hoped either to

defeat the incumbents or to make them so nervous that they would fear their own

shadows. Other business groups joined in. By the time a few "safe seat" senior

members who had always played by the rules lost re-election bids, a new type of

electoral anxiety was created.<p>



<p>



As it happened, the attack by business on incumbents had less effect than

anticipated: congressional "morality rates" are about the same today as they

were in the 1950s, and as the anti-business mood of Congress has dissipated,

corporate funding has returned to its traditional pattem. In 1984 business

contributions favored incumbents by a wide margin. Another force has arisen to

feed the anxiety: an explosion in single-interest groups and independent

negative-campaign organizations like the National Conservative Political Action

Committee, which specialize in attack. NCPAC may not be the juggernaut it once

appeared. Its track record of defeating incumbents is modest, and in several

races NCPAC'S efforts have backfired. But the proliferation of groups like it,

armed with millions of dollars, has kept the re-election anxiety level on the

high plane to which business first raised it. In the 1982 congressional

elections the largest single pool of money was the $64.3 million spent by

"nonconnected" ideological PACS. Total corporate PAC spending, in contrast, was

$43.3 million.<p>



<p>



Most of the money spent by ideological PACS is used to attack someone or

something, rather than to propose constructive solutions. Negative views sit

well with the public in the wake of two Presidents in a row--Carter and

Reagan--who have campaigned "against Washington." "Americans are by nature

skeptical of authority, and inclined to believe the worst about govemment,"

Representative Willis Gradison, of Ohio, says. "This makes an anti-Washington

or anti-Congress campaign the easiest type of campaign to sell to voters." It

also profoundly affects the tone of politics, making congressmen feel that they

must endlessly justify themselves by endlessly campaigning: merely being in

Washington renders them guilty until shown innocent. <p>



<p>



This campaign trend and the growth of television interact with each other in a

diabolical way. "Today, if you can't sell an issue in twenty seconds, you can't

use it," Representative Synar says. "It only takes twenty seconds to say 'Your

congressman is against prayer.' It takes me five minutes to explain why that's

wrong. But television won't give me five minutes. Television demands that I

boil everything down to a single sentence." Synar adds that the only way he can

reply to a negative charge within twenty seconds is with another negative,

knocking the ball back into his opponent's court. This need to be negative

suits perfectly the internal imperatives of television, which congressmen are

increasingly aware of and anxious to satisfy. Television producers assume that

they are struggling to grab viewers' attention every second the set is on: most

viewers are eating, reading, talking, or otherwise distracted. Emotional facial

expressions and confrontations tend to make them look up from dinner, and thus

are prized.<p>



<p>



Confrontations also have human story lines that can be grasped by someone who

just walked into the room. Even the viewer who wants to be well informed about

public policy, if he walks in when a complicated discussion is in progress, may

assume that he has already missed too much and change channels, whereas the

viewer walking in during an argument can immediately pick up on what's

happening. Whether Gary Hart's "new ideas" were good or bad, television

reporters tended to skip over them during his presidential-nomination campaign,

because they were complicated and took too long to explain. The fact that Hart

had changed his name and signature, however, could be communicated in a single

sentence, and called forth emotional reactions that made for lively television.

During the much-publicized Roger Mudd interview, Mudd addressed seventeen

questions and comments to Hart. Only one of the seventeen concerned an issue.

All the rest were about style or were confrontational questions designed to

provoke emotional responses. "Why do you imitate John Kennedy so much?" would

embarrass any candidate who was imitating Kennedy and anger any candidate who

wasn't--the perfect television question.<p>



<p>



Congress has made a seemingly minor internal-policy change that fuels the

endless campaign: it now pays for members to shuttle back and forth between

Washington and their districts. In the 1960s congressmen were allowed up to

twelve trips home a year. Now they get expense accounts sufficient to pay for

about forty trips. Between government-financed trips and those financed by

trade associations and other groups, most members of Congress now go home

almost every weekend.<p>



<p>



The fact that congressmen are out of town on weekends has led to a significant

decrease in personal contact among them. Congressmen who don't know one another

are more likely to believe the worst of one another's motives, and to lack a

sense of common purpose. The introduction into the House, in 1974, of an

electronic voting system that employs magnetic key cards has also played a role

in this change. Jack Gregory, an official in the Office of the Clerk of the

House, says, "Before electronic voting, it took the House forty-five minutes or

so to read the rolls. Members were physically compelled to be in the chamber

during that time, and they didn't have much to do, so often they would chat and

get to know each other. With electronic voting, they can breeze in and breeze

out."<p>



<p>



Representative Udall recalls how different it was when his brother, Stewart,

was a congressman, in the 1950s: "He used to drive here from Arizona with the

kids in January, and then in June they'd drive home for the summer. If there

was a fall session, Stewart would drive back here alone and the kids would go

to school in Arizona through the fall; then he'd drive back home at Christmas

to get them. That was all--two trips a year at the most." Now, Udall says, he

himself flies back to Arizona thirty-five weekends a year and sometimes during

the week. "From a campaigning standpoint, it means you no longer have that

excuse, when someone wants you to appear, of saying you won't be back in town

for three months. They know you can get on a plane." Congressmen from the

western states spend about one day a week in transit, flying back and forth. To

accommodate them, congressional schedules are arranged to be light on Mondays

and Fridays, and thus are all the more hectic in the middle of the week.

Another result of all the traveling and campaigning is simply exhaustion. Synar

says, "I am tired, physically tired, all the time, and so are most of the

members I know. Tired people do not always make clear decisions."<p>



<p>



<br>



<b>BIG MONEY, BIG ANXIETY</b><p>



<p>



Money rarely buys election. In 1982 the republican Party raised five times as

much money as the Democratic Party, but the Democrats won more seats. Money

can, however, buy individual congressmen's votes on a bill, or distort

congressmen's thinking on an issue--normally all an interest group needs to

achieve its ends. Most important to the structure of Congress, the velocity at

which campaign spending has increased over the past ten years has engendered a

permanent state of anxiety in which congressmen can never stop worrying about

fund-raising and the compromises it entails.<p>



<p>



In 1974 a total of $72.5 million was spent on congressional races. In 1982 the

amount had risen to $289 million, a 306 percent increase during a period when

the consumer price index rose 96 percent. In 1974 the mean expenditure per

candidate for the House was $53,000; by 1982 it had risen to $228,000. Those

running for senator spent an average of $437,000 apiece in 1974, $1.8 million

in 1982. Most of the new money came from PACS, from direct-mail solicitations,

and from individuals giving at the behest of PACS--business executives who

"voluntarily" made individual contributions to candidates designated by their

firms, for example. Most of the new money has been spent on television, usually

for ads that say little or nothing about matters of substance.<p>



<p>



These numbers are impressive enough in themselves, but they represent only part

of the picture. Two almost entirely new categories of campaign spending came

into being in the 1970s--the nonconnected negative spending of ideological PACS

and the "soft money" spending by groups that in order to get around campaign

laws are not officially tied to candidates (most of the big money spent in 1982

for conservative Republicans fell into this category, as did Walter Mondale's

"delegate committee" spending in the Democratic primaries). Of the $190 million

spent by all PACs on the 1982 congressional campaign, only $84 million went to

candidates; the rest went to negative spending or to soft-money commercials in

support of candidates who theoretically had no idea that the commercials were

being made. In many races the amounts of nonconnected negative and loosely

connected soft money spent were greater than party contributions to the

candidates; for example, direct contributions to 1982 Republican candidates by

the Republican Party averaged $18,000, but soft-money expenses to assist them

averaged $264,000.<p>



<p>



The rapid acceleration of political spending has taken place for many reasons,

among them changes in the campaign laws, an increased focus on Washington as

both a cause of national problems and a source of lavish bailouts, and the

greater use of ever-more-expensive television time. When the campaign-reform

laws of the early 1970s were passed, the pattern of political giving was for

unions to collect small sums and donate them to Democrats through proto-PACs

like the AFL-CIO's COPE; for small contributors on both sides to send money

more or less spontaneously, usually to addresses they found on campaign

brochures or at the end of television appeals; and for wealthy businessmen to

give large sums to Republicans, in order to receive tax advantages and to win

reputations as players. After Watergate left many large donors either indicted

or humiliated because their contributions had wound up in the hands of the

burglars, businessmen were happy to take a lower profile and find an impersonal

means--the PAC loophole in the new laws--for their gifts.<p>



<p>



Between PACS and direct mail it has become possible to raise very large sums on

a routine basis, and the new political environment of obsession with Washington

makes it likelier that companies and individuals will respond when asked. New

money-raising tends to appeal to the lowest common denominator, relying on

negative pitches, scare tactics, and exaggeration--all political standbys, but

refined with targeted marketing techniques.<p>



<p>



Political expenditures now function roughly like an arms race in which neither

side wants to keep raising the stakes but each is afraid that if it stops, its

opponent will not. (Like most weapons, most political contributions serve

mainly to cancel each other out.) With expenses constantly rising, there is no

telling how much will be needed for next year's race; several of the

congressmen I spoke to said they had lost track of what a "reasonable" total

campaign expense might be. So, in the manner of the protagonists in an arms

race, congressmen feel compelled to stockpile.<p>



<p>



It's there for the asking--who could resist? Representative Henson Moore, of

Louisiana, had $332,000 left over when he won re-election in 1982 by 87 percent

of the vote, and he has continued to raise money at an unflagging pace, adding

another $273,000 through 1983 and the first six months of 1984. Representative

Dan Rostenkowski, of Illinois, raised $519,000 for the 1982 campaign, although

he ran nearly unopposed, and raised another $168,000 in 1983. Rostenkowski is

the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, whose members, along

with those of the parallel Senate Finance Committee, have the easiest time

obtaining donations, since they are in the best position to do specific money

favors for specific industries.<p>



<p>



That campaign-law reforms accidentally encouraged PACs is widely known, but the

greater irony is that they have made congressmen MORE LIKELY to sell out, and

to do so on a wider range of issues. Contributions are now limited to $1,000

for individuals and $5,000 for organizations. What is $5,000 to a congressman

who must raise $228,000? Not much, unless he can snare every offer of $5,000

that comes along. No individual contribution is particularly significant; only

many gifts from many interests will suffice.<p>



<p>



In years past a politician like Robert Kerr, senator from Oklahoma, might be in

thrall to the oil interests but a free man on other issues. Two or three checks

from the right bank account would have been enough to fund his campaign.

Similarly, in 1974, the year of the reform laws, two or three checks from

wealthy sources could have supplied the mean of $53,000 spent in a House

campaign. Today, to raise a large number of contributions, each small compared

with the total amount required, a congressman takes advantage of every possible

PAC source, and that means making promises to every special interest at every

turn.<p>



<p>



As a result, congressmen now owe their first loyalty to PAC interests rather

than to party or public interests. Corporate lobbyists generally want small

favors--a vote on a bill, sometimes as little as a few words inserted into a

regulation or a different effective date on a tax provision. Because the favor

requested is small and specific, congressmen know that lobbyists will be

watching closely to make sure it is delivered; and they know that, by the same

token, very few voters will notice or care whether a commodity-straddle

exemption is retroactive to 1982 or 1981. This makes possible a relationship

between PAC donations and specific votes that is not possible between PAC

donations and general-election returns.<p>



<p>



Best Congress money can buy stories have grown so familiar in recent years that

they have lost their power to scandalize and are now thought of as the naive

complaints of good-government wimps. What kind of national government is it

where selling out is so widespread, so generally ACCEPTED that it no longer

causes outrage? In the House recently there have been two rival versions of the

Superfund bill for the cleanup of toxic wastes; studies by the Congress Watch

organization recently discovered that representatives who sponsored the mild

version, favored by business, averaged $4,784 in contributions from

chemical-company PACS; those who sponsored the strict version averaged $532

from such companies. Since 1981, another public-interest group has found,

representatives who regularly voted for bills favored by nuclear-power

interests have averaged nearly four times as much in donations from companies

in nuclear fields as those who regularly voted against. These are but two of

many examples.<p>



<p>



There is another reason that congressmen are so concerned with campaign

fund-raising: sometimes they can keep the money. Campaign law allows retiring

congressmen to convert unspent contributions to personal use, as a sort of

informal retirement bonus. So the more a congressman raises, the more he can

make--an exceptionally powerful financial incentive not to rock the boat and

upset interest groups. When Representative Ray Roberts, of Texas, retired, in

1981, he took with him $13,014 from his campaign fund. In 1979 Congress amended

the campaign laws to end such "closeouts" for future congressmen, but those

voting took pains to exempt themselves: any congressman first elected before

1980 will be allowed to keep his campaign funds when he retires.<p>



<p>



Congressmen who raise more than they need can also use their money to make

contributions to each other. Many now have their own personal

PACs--Rostenkowski; Stephen Solarz, of New York; and Henry Waxman, of

California, among them. Congressmen make donations to assist congressmen of

like philosophical slant and to increase their own influence in Congress and

within their committees. Well-heeled congressmen competing for the affections

of other congressmen through internal PACs have become another force for

congressional fractiousness<p>



<p>



An interest group wishing to make a cash payment to a congressman need not

resort to the roundabout means of investment in a retirement fund: it can

simply give an honorarium for a speech, money that goes straight into the

congressman's pocket. Eleven senators earned more in 1983 from speaking fees

than from their salaries. Richard Lugar, of Indiana, netted $129,065 (after

contributions to charity) from honoraria; Robert Dole, of Kansas, netted

$106,917; and twenty-one senators took in more than $50,000. Corporations

pushing a bill that limits product liability paid $34,000 to Senator Paul

Laxalt, of Nevada $30,350 to Senator Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and $26,250 to

Senator Kasten from 1981 through 1983. Similar fees have been paid by other

lobbying interests to other congressmen for speeches, and PAID is the proper

word: while congressmen use the word HONORARIA to make their appearances sound

like some lofty philanthropic activity, anyone else who makes a speech in

return for a fee is referred to as paid.<p>



<p>



Honoraria are possible because Congress excluded itself from the

conflict-of-interest regulations it imposed on others. If a White House aide

accepted $34,000 from a company trying to influence the Administration's stand

on the product-liability bill, there would be loud calls in Congress for the

aide's head. Edwin Meese's nomination as attorney general was thrown into limbo

because Meese borrowed less than congressmen routinely take.<p>



<p>



Congressmen also suffer from anxiety relating to their own salaries. Inflation

has reduced the buying power of congressional pay by about 40 percent since

1972, while the salaries of corporate executives have gone into orbit. Both

senators and representatives make $72,600 and have an honoraria limit of$21,780

(a law limiting honoraria to 30 percent of a congressman's salary was passed

recently, after bad publicity about the huge fees).<p>



<p>



Yet congressmen spend their time determining the fates of people who make

substantially more--lobbyists earning $150,000 to $500,000 a year solicit them,

television newscasters pulling down six-figure salaries (thanks in part to

monopoly licenses Congress gave the networks) interview them, corporate

executives beg them for tax favors and import restrictions that will translate

into higher executive bonuses. The resentments that arise may not reflect

favorably on those who profess to be public servants, but they are nevertheless

real and they prey on congressmen's minds, especially since congressmen tend to

view themselves as executives of the world's largest and most important

corporation. So whereas $72,600 a year is a lot to the average person, it can

easily seem paltry to a congressman; the resulting salary anxiety both

distracts congressmen from the people's work and encourages the type of

rationalization according to which there's nothing wrong with taking $5,000

from a chemical company and voting on its bill the following day.<p>



<p>



Congress voting itself a raise is among the most charged of all political

topics, yet the public might find it far cheaper in the long run to give

congressmen a sizable increase--say, to $100,000--while barring them from

outside income of all kinds. The extra few million could be a bargain compared

with the money that would be saved if congressmen no longer had an incentive to

avert their eyes from billions in cost overruns and sweetheart deals, just to

be able to skim a few thousand off for themselves.<p>



<p>



<br>



<b>MULTIPLE LOBBYING</b><p>



<p>



There are so many lobbyists because there are so many opportunities to lobby.

The breakdown of the seniority system and the weakening of congressional

leadership has drastically increased the number of people on whom the touch

must be put.<p>



<p>



A well-informed veteran lobbyist says, "There used to be two to five guys on

each side [House and Senate] who had absolute control over any category of

bills you might want. All you had to do was get to them. Now getting the top

guys is no guarantee. You have to lobby every member on every relevant

subcommittee and even [lobby] the membership at large."<p>



<p>



Another lobbyist, Eiler Ravnholt, who was for twelve years the administrative

assistant to Senator Daniel Inouye, of Hawaii, and who now represents the

Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association, adds that it has become necessary to lobby

the expanded staff as well. "In the present environment congressmen spend so

much time campaigning that they have no choice but to cede much of the

legislative authority to their staffs," Ravnholt says. "During the 1960s it was

not unusual to walk into the Senate library and see Sam Ervin sitting at a

desk, researching a bill. Ervin was an exception, but not that much of an

exception; until fairly recently many congressmen played active roles in the

legislative detail work. Now they can't. Nobody can. The staff does the detail

work, and so you must lobby the staff." And where before there were a few

important individuals on the House and Senate staffs, now there are

thousands.<p>



<p>



And thousands of lobbyists. There are 6,500 registered lobbyists in Washington

(twelve for every congressman), but the figure does not include

trade-association officers, lawyers working on retainer to clients, or liaison

officials of corporations with Washington offices. The generally accepted total

is about 20,000, or thirty-seven lobbyists for every congressman. Determined

interest groups often hire several lobbyists, whose contacts grant access to

different sectors of Congress. Brewers pressing for a

beer-distribution-monopoly bill have, for example, hired the firm of Wagner and

Baroody (all-purpose lobbying), Kip O'Neill, son of Tip O'Neill (access to

Democrats), the former congressman John Napier, of South Carolina (access to

Republicans), and Romano Romani, a former aide to Senator Dennis DeConcini

(access to senators). So many lobbyists in Washington now represent so many

overlapping interests that a subspecialty has sprung up--lobbying among

lobbyists.<p>



<p>



The budget process has been a veritable boon to the lobbying profession. With

multiple votes, there is a steady progression of brush fires for lobbyists to

stamp out--increasing their clients' anxiety and willingness to pay high

fees--and also many more opportunities for a lobbyist to make his case. "Now

they can wear you down," Senator Patrick Leahy, of Vermont, says. "You might be

able to hold out for the public interest on the first, second, third, fourth,

fifth votes, but on the sixth vote they're back again, and many give in."<p>



<p>



Unlike the public, whose attention fades from an issue when it appears that the

struggle has been fought and finished (HOUSE KILLS MX), lobbyists have an

interest in duplication. Billing by the hour, they are only too happy to have

the process drag on interminably. And their attention does not wander: the many

minor budget votes that become a blur even in the minds of congressmen are a

perfect vehicle for quietly winning concession after concession. Representative

Udall says, "The more fragmented the system is, the easier it is for pressure

groups to exert control. This is a side effect of our reforms no one

anticipated."<p>



<p>



When a House-Senate conference committee working on the "deficit down payment"

bill went into all-night session last June, the other congressmen went home,

but the lobbyists stayed. As Rostenkowski and Senate Finance Committee Chairman

Dole emerged with an agreement at 5:30 A.M., they found about a hundred

lobbyists still sitting outside the conference room. Among the 282 provisions

of the bill, which was supposed to reduce the deficit, was a new $1.4 billion

tax break for insurance companies; $600 million in reduced capital-gains taxes;

$300 million in extra benefits for commodity traders, mainly in Rostenkowski's

home town, Chicago, who had used tax straddles (the benefits were for

"professional" traders, not ordinary citizens--only for the people who were

supplying the money Rostenkowski doesn't need), and other favors.<p>



<p>



So pervasive are lobbyists in Congress that it is not uncommon to see them

crowded outside the main chamber doors in the House and Senate giving thumbs-up

or thumbs-down signals to congressmen rushing in for roll-call votes.

Photographers are forbidden to take pictures by the chamber doors, so they

cannot capture this spectacle. Lobbyists became upset recently when, in the

wake of the Senate bombing, Capitol security passes were issued. The lobbyists

were granted access privileges, but their passes were blue, whereas staff

passes were red or yellow and press passes green; this made it easy to tell

when a congressman was in the company of a lobbyist. Fortunately for lobbyists,

it has become fashionable on Capitol Hill to wear one's pass tucked into one's

shirt pocket.<p>



<p>



Ideological lobby groups have increased in number since the early 1970s; most

specialize in anti-politics and take pride in bringing Congress to a halt. The

increases in roll-call voting have been caused partly by ideologically extreme

congressmen who demand recorded votes even when they know they will lose, in

order to create a record they can run against--a sort of anti-Washington index.

In the winter of 1984, when the school-prayer issue was at its peak, many

senators felt that a silent-prayer amendment stood a good chance of passing.

But Reagan Administration lobbyists were adamant that a silent-prayer amendment

not be allowed on the floor, for the very reason that it might succeed. They

were hoping instead to lose a roll-call vote on vocal prayer and thereby create

a convenient list of "against prayer" Democrats for Republicans to attack

during the fall campaign.<p>



<p>



Like expanded staffs and extra subcommittees, interest groups, once they are

formed, take on lives of their own. Senator Leahy explains, "Say a group is

created to campaign for an issue, like school prayer. Once it has a director, a

staff, and a mailing list, it is not going to go out of business if the staff

has anything to do about it. They will look for another issue. Half of the

interest groups are really running on self-interest, the interest of the staffs

in keeping their jobs." Jesse Helms's National Congressional Club, as the

journalist Tina Rosenberg has documented, raised $9.3 million during the 1982

election cycle, ostensibly to aid conservative causes, but gave away only

$150,000; fully 98 percent of the contributions went to salaries and

overhead.<p>



<p>



Congressmen have many money-related reasons to be tolerant of lobbyists, among

them that an increasing number of retired or defeated congressmen are staying

in Washington to become lobbyists themselves. Of 856 living former congressmen,

roughly 25 percent are still in the Washington area--although fewer than one

percent came from the Washington area originally. Every longtime Washington

observer I have spoken to agrees that the percentage of congressmen staying in

Washington is much higher today than it was in the past. Even the percentage of

offspring and siblings in lobbying is up, as Bill Keller, of The New York

Times, has written. Besides Kip O'Neill (whose firm lobbies for sugar and

cruise-ship concerns in addition to beer), there is Robin Dole, daughter of

Robert Dole (a lobbyist for Century 21), Jamie Whitten, Jr. (steel, barge, and

cork interests), Virginia Brown, daughter of House Majority Leader James Wright

(National Association of Homebuilders), Michelle Laxalt, daughter of Paul (oil,

Wall Street, Hollywood), John Laxalt, brother of Paul (South Korean industry),

James Schroeder, husband of Colorado Representative Patricia Schroeder (Israeli

interests), and others. Everybody's doing it--why not me? Or my family?<p>



<p>



Even the number of Congress's internal lobby groups, or caucuses, has risen.

Today twenty-seven formal caucuses have staffs and receive federal funds;

another sixty operate informally out of members' offices. Current caucuses

include the Senate Copper Caucus, the House Footwear Caucus, the Congressional

Port Caucus, the House and Senate Steel caucuses, the Senate Tourism Caucus,

the Congressional Crime Caucus (not a fund-raising group), the Senate Rail

Caucus, the Congressional Coal Group, the Congressional Jewelry Manufacturing

Coalition, the Congressional Alcohol Fuels Caucus, the Senate Children's

Caucus, and the Congressional Mushroom Caucus.<p>

<b>NO FUN ANYMORE</b><p>



<p>



"I often feel that by the time I arrived in Congress, in 1974, the fun was

over," Representative Gradison says. "All the landmark legislation, the laws

that were exciting and glorious to take part in, had been passed. Now the bills

were beginning to fall due, and there would not be glorious work for us, just

the struggle to pay those bills."<p>



<p>



Through the 1960s and early 1970s Congress made history time and again: the

Civil Rights Act; the Voting Rights Act; the Clean Air and Water acts; Medicare

and Medicaid; the Resource Conservation and Recovery and Toxic Substances

Control acts, which started federal action against toxic wastes; new federal

housing programs and aid to education; the successful battles against Nixon and

the seniority system; public financing for presidential races; disclosure laws

for federal candidates and officials--the list goes on.<p>



<p>



Twenty years ago a congressman looking at the nation saw wrongs, like legally

sanctioned discrimination, that could be righted simply by changing the law. It

can be argued that today's political horizon is far different. There are many

intractable dilemmas, but few open-and-shut cases such as raw pollution being

pumped into a stream. Most current social problems don't have self-evident

solutions of the type that Congress could codify in bills and announce

tomorrow. Stopping the poll tax against blacks was one thing; moving an entire

generation out of the ghetto and into the economic mainstream is quite another,

and it's not at all clear how that can be done.<p>



<p>



Congressmen face, instead, the tasks of reining in dramatic programs of

previous Congresses and cutting the deficit, which are neither politically

glamorous nor pleasant tasks. "They build statues and name schools after people

who promote great programs," Representative Bill Frenzel, of Minnesota, says.

"They never build statues for people who have to say no."<p>



<p>



Indeed, what with the fragmentation of Congress, the inherent unpleasantness of

cutbacks, and the eye-glazing vista of deficits of $172 billion, it becomes

difficult for congressmen to take seriously the idea that any one particular

cut matters. Everybody's taking what they can get--why should my program be the

one to suffer when the deficit is so vast? What difference could another few

hundred million possibly make?<p>



<p>



Traditionally, congressmen find it easiest to advocate a bold new spirit of

austerity in someone else's state or district. But there is a sense in which

congressmen do not even mind excessive spending in other districts: it creates

an atmosphere in which overspending is the norm and money for pet programs is

less likely to be challenged.<p>



<p>



In June, when the $18 billion water-projects authorization bill was about to go

to the House floor, James Howard, of New Jersey, the chairman of the Public

Works Committee, circulated a roster of the House with black spots next to the

names of members in whose districts were programs he planned to attack if they

voted against the water bill. Included in the Public Works Committee's bill was

$189 million for a dam in the district of the committee's ranking Republican,

Representative Gene Snyder, of Kentucky. Representative Harold Wolpe, of

Michigan, who got a black dot, told T. R. Reid, of The Washington Post, "You

always hear rumors in the cloakroom that they'll kill your project if you dare

to oppose anybody else's, but this is the first time I've ever seen them put it

on paper....It's extraordinarily blatant." The more spending in general, the

more for my district: everybody does it. Any congressman who goes after another

congressman's program knows his will be attacked in turn, both by the

congressman and by the program's PACS and lobbyists. Even a congressman who

might be willing to accept a cut in his own district knows that in the present

undisciplined environment he would be played for a sucker; no other congressmen

would join in the sacrifice.<p>



<p>



This attitude helps explain why, for example, nearly every Congressman favors

cutting the defense budget in the absttact but votes to preserve the individual

programs that make up that budget. In 1983 Congress ADDED $4.6 billion to the

Pentagon appropriations that President Reagan had asked for. Defense lobbyists

in particular are adept, when budget showdowns approach, at avoiding any

discussion of whether their projects are the efficient or otherwise proper

choice, and at framing the issues strictly in terms of jobs: Congressman, this

vote represents 2,000 jobs for your district. Any government expenditure

creates jobs--the question is what jobs are best for the nation when national

needs, finances, and policies are weighed. But this question is seldom posed to

an individual congressman. The question posed is, Do you want these jobs in

your district today or not? Do you want your name on them or not?<p>



<p>



These considerations apply to most government spending decisions; but they do

so with unusual force in defense because of the twenty-second rule. A

congressman who presses to reform specific defense programs will win little

political credit. Few voters knew or care what, say, an AGM-65D is; there's no

reason why a voter should, and the benefits of pentagon reform--lower deficits

and greater national readiness--are long-term and directly felt by no one. At

the same time, any congressman who challenges a military-spending program

exposes himself to the twentysecond charge of being "against defense."<p>



<p>



Cutting back and slowing down giveaways has never been fun. For example, it

took a public outcry in the late 1940s to kill the excise tax and color

restrictions on margarine, which were bald favors for the dairy lobby. But now

the congressional agenda seems to consist almost entirely of no-fun issues, and

there is no indication that Congress is ready to face them.<p>



<p>



The results of the 1984 summer session are suggestive. Congress went into the

session having passed the "deficit down payment" bill, which included $50

billion in tax increases over a three-year period but only $13 billion in

spending cuts--mostly from Medicare payments, although $1.1 billion of the

"cuts" came from postponing payment of military retirees' cost-of-living

adjustments (COLAs) so that they would fall in the next fiscal year. (On the

same day that the House Budget Committee was making its "down payment," the

full House was approving initial funding for the space station, which makes for

a dramatic election-year announcement, and costs little now, but commits the

nation to spending at least $8 billion over the next few years to build the

project and many billions more to operate it.)<p>



<p>



During August two of the leading boondoggles at present, the Synthetic Fuels

Corporation and subsidized operation of the Hoover Dam, came up for votes.

There was a chance to kill synfuels subsidies, but only limited cuts were made,

and $8 billion was left in the.program. Meanwhile, power subsidies for the

Southwest, where electricity from federally financed dams costs about one

twelfth what consumer-financed power costs in the East, were preserved and

extended until 2017 at a cost of at least $6 billion. These two acts alone

wiped out all the cuts in the "deficit down payment."<p>



<p>



Through the summer congressmen continued to try to have fun, passing new

spending bills: $1 billion extra for college financial aid, $175,000 to study

promotion of Iowa commerce, $2.5 million for the city of Oakland to restore a

presidential yacht, $1 million for business loans in Queens, $12 million for a

highway-safety "demonstration" program in Michigan, increases in the

Corporation for Public Broadcasting's budget, then $130 million, to $270

million a year by 1989, an extra $350 million in postal subsidies, $500,000 for

a golf course near Capitol Hill. Congress was only following the example of the

President. At a news conference on July 24 he had condemned Congress and blamed

its "do-nothing Democrats" for failing to pass a balanced-budget amendment. He

went on to ask for a $5 billion bonus Social Security benefit increase, a new

IRA tax break, extra tax benefits for business in enterprise zones, and more

tuition tax credits for private schools.<p>



<p>



<p>



1920s, 1980s<p>



<p>



Henry Bellmon, a senator from Oklahoma, retired in 1980 to return to his farm

near Billings, grow wheat, and raise cattle. He had been the ranking Republican

on the Budget Committee; had he stayed, he probably would have become chairman.

When I spoke with him, the latest Congressional Budget Office estimates had

just been released. There would be a $172 billion deficit this year (the

all-time record, before Reagan, was $66 billion). Federal borrowing would be

$175 billion, about the same as the deficit. Interest on those loans would

account for $110 billion, or close to twice the highest pre-Reagan deficit for

interest alone: little principal would be retired.<p>



<p>



The CBO projected that EVEN IF ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES UNABATED, the deficit

will be $263 billion in 1989. If growth is moderate, the deficit will be $308

billion. The CBO didn't calculate what might happen if there is another

recession. "There simply aren't enough discretionary cuts left to affect

deficits like that," Bellmon said. He proceeded to recite the basic breakdown

of present federal spending:<p>



<p>



<p>



Entitlements (mainly Social Security, Medicare, military and civil-service

pensions): 45 percent<p>



<p>



Welfare: less than one percent<p>



<p>



Defense: 28 percent<p>



<p>



Interest on the federal debt: 14 percent<p>



<p>



Everything else: 13 percent<p>



<p>



Percentage of present federal spending that is deficit spending: 20<p>



<p>



<p>



Bellmon explained, "That means that if you cut out absolutely everything

government does that is not related to entitlements or national defense, you

would still have a deficit." Absolutely everything would include closing down

the FBI, the State Department, the CIA, and all other federal agencies; ending

all education grants and revenue-sharing grants to states and cities ("fiscally

sound" local governments are financed in part by the federal deficit, although

mayors and governors usually forget to mention that when they condemn the big

spenders in Washington); stopping all farm price supports and all federal

construction and maintenance of highways, bridges, waterways, subways, and

dams; ending Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation protection of bank deposits

and cutting off all federally subsidized mortgage loans; closing down the

National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation,

the Centers for Disease Control, the Smithsonian, and the National

Transportation Safety Board; ending all border patrols and abolishing the

Immigration and Naturalization Service; ending all airtraffic control, all

inspection of nuclear-power plants, all monitoring of stock fraud through the

Securities and Exchange Commission, all federal arts funding, all federal

courts, all national parks.<p>



<p>



"Under these conditions we have only three choices," Bellmon continued. "What

must happen is either a major arms-reduction agreement with the Soviets that

will allow us to cut back drastically on defense. Or a major reduction in the

COLAs for everybody. Or a major tax increase. Those are the choices."<p>



<p>



In other words, except in the unlikely event of a new detente, the message of

politics in the 1980s must be, Expect less--either less Social Security and

Medicare and lower pensions or less income after taxes.<p>



<p>



In the 1920s society lived well beyond its means and pretended that tomorrow

would never come. Is the United States Congress, in its present state, able to

deal with tomorrow? Can it take the message to the voters that they should in

every way expect less?<p>



<p>



In early January the Ninety-ninth Congress will prepare to convene. The first

few days, in which the party caucuses will meet to make committee assignments

and alter rules, will set the tone for the next two years. Here are some

possibilities congressional leaders might consider:<p>



<p>



Committee structures should.be combined and simplified; particularly, the

quadruple budget/appropriations/authorization/revenue sequence should be

reduced by at least one phase. The most logical and least turf-destructive

reductions would be to combine the budget committees with the revenue

committees, putting the combined groups in control of overall

revenue-versus-appropriations ratios, and to eliminate the appropriations

committees. Money and policy amount to the same thing. Why must Congress

pretend otherwise?<p>



<p>



Seniority-system reforms should be reeled back somewhat--not to return to the

stagnant old days but to stop the tail from wagging the dog.<p>



<p>



Congressmen should receive a substantial raise and in return be required to

forsake all forms of outside income. They are supposed to function as judges of

society's needs; they should be as far above reproach (and influence) as

judges.<p>



<p>



There should be an absolute freeze on present federal-spending levels,

extending to all entitlement programs and defense. If Congress wanted to

allocate more money to one program, it would have to take some away from

somewhere else. Congressmen cannot hope to reverse the "everybody does it"

mentality of deficit increases without a political tool--a means by which they

can argue to constituents (in simple, twenty-second terms) that they would like

to give them more but just can't. There is nothing in the original social

compacts of Social Security and other entitlement programs that confers a

"right" to perpetual increases or to benefits for those who don't need them;

those "rights" are political creations of Congress, and can be reversed.<p>



<p>



A pay-as-you-go law should be enacted. Advocated by Senator John Glenn and

others, pay-as-you-go would be a direct means of accomplishing what the budget

process attempts to accomplish indirectly: tying government revenues to

spending. Any legislation allocating new funds would at the same time have to

provide a source for those funds, in the form of either a tax increase or a

deduction from another program. When a person buys something, he considers the

purchase not in the abstract but in light of how much he has to spend and what

will be left over for other purchases. Businesses act the same way. Only

government separates the question of what to spend from what is affordable.

Pay-as-you-go would have far more teeth than the strictly symbolic

balanced-budget amendment, which would require Congress to balance the budget

unless, on an annual basis, it voted otherwise. The balanced-budget amendment

would add another showy "process" but no actual discipline.<p>



<p>



Budgets should be drawn up on a two-year cycle to reduce duplication.

Multi-year procurement cycles should be employed for the development and

manufacture of complicated items like weapons. Military contractors may feed at

the public trough in a shameless manner, but in their behalf it should be said

that changing their instructions regularly, as Congress is prone to do, does

not make for efficient business. To help longer-cycle budgets work, Congress

should devise a "this time we really mean it" clause that could prevent budget

decisions from being constantly re-opened for tinkering.<p>



<p>



Lobbyists should be denied access to the Capitol. Of course lobbyists are not

all sinister; most are simply doing their job. But the number of supplicants

gathered round to demand handouts makes it difficult for congressmen to think

clearly. Imagine lobbyists for parties in a lawsuit allowed in to see the

judge--how credible would his decision be? And having lobbyists crowd outside

the chambers of the House and Senate, flashing thumb signs to congressmen like

coaches issuing orders to Little Leaguers, is a national disgrace.<p>



<p>



There should be a cap on total campaign expenditures for each candidate. The

existence of PACS and interest groups is far less corrupting than the need to

raise great and ever-greater sums. If House races were limited to, say,

$100,000 and Senate races to $500,000, the temptation to pander would be

greatly reduced. Also, all campaign funds unspent after a given election should

either be returned to donors or be contributed toward retiring the federal

debt. If there were a cap on what congressmen could spend and no way for them

to hoard what they didn't spend, fundraising would be far less addictive than

it is today. Restraining nonconnected and soft-money groups would not be as

easy as restraining congressmen. But at least this proposal would get the

congressmen out of fund-raising and back to their responsibilities.<p>



<p>



What can be done to restrain indirect spending on campaigns when the

Constitution guarantees freedom of speech? Preserve that freedom by limiting

all advertising TO SPEECH. Whether by candidates or by representatives of

soft-money or ideological groups, only SPEECH, in which an actual, real, named,

identifiable person stands and talks, would be permitted. No electronic

graphics; no talking cows; no actors pretending to be men in the street; no

sunset walks along the beach. Banning Madison Avenue-style advertising from

politics has been advocated by Curtis Gans, the director of the Committee for

the Study of the American Electorate. The Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that

money used to buy time on or space in communication media equates to the

freedom of speech. This ruling has caused many people to think that the Gans

approach would be held unconstitutional. But what do special effects, actors,

and graphics have to do with any freedom we hold dear? Their purpose is to

evade political debate, not advance it. Let money be used to buy TV spots, but

only ones that hold to a standardized format, in which real candidates or real

spokesmen for groups stand before the same solid-color background and state

their ideas--whatever those ideas might be--with absolute privilege. This would

surely satisfy the Founding Fathers, reduce the cost of campaigning, and by the

way return the focus of politics to the issues.<p>



<p>



The congressional calendar should be fixed, making it harder to put off

decisions over and over again. A quarter system might be appropriate. During

three quarters of the year congressmen would not be permitted to shuttle home

to campaign but would be required to stay in Washington and attend to their

work. During the fourth quarter Congress would shut down, and congressmen could

return to their districts to find out for themselves what is happening there.

During this time they could also hold away-from-Washington hearings--an art

that died with television and instant access to publicity--in order to hear

testimony from average Americans, not members of the Washington expert set.<p>



<p>



None of these reforms would be easy to implement, especially those that involve

intrusions upon existing turf and perquisites. But if congressmen cannot govern

Congress, how can they hope to govern the country?<p>



<p>



In 1984 several governors were begged by national party officials to run for

Senate seats; all refused, seeing no reason to surrender jobs where they could

accomplish something useful in order to submit themselves to the 535-ring

circus that is Congress. A generation ago the idea of politicians who would

rather avoid joining the Senate would have been outrageous; now it seems

perfectly reasonable. Congress, unique among our government institutions, has

control over its own fate--it can't blame another branch of the government for

its condition. Before Congress can lead the nation, it must be able to lead

itself.

<blockquote>
	<i><font size=4>A look at the life, the sentiments, and the aspirations--including, for 
some, combat--of women in the U.S. Army, the vanguard service insofar as 
the role of women in the military is concerned.</i></font><p>
	
	
	<pre>
	
	</pre>
	
	<font size=5>A</font>t 0055 hours on December 20, 1989, U.S. Army helicopters lifted off from 
Howard Air Force Base, in Panama, to carry infantry across the Panama 
Canal. Their mission was to assault Fort Amador, one of the few 
strongholds of the Panamanian Defense Forces to offer resistance to the 
American forces that had invaded Panama as part of Operation Just Cause. 
Two of the helicopter pilots ferrying the troops were women: First 
Lieutenant Lisa Kutschera and Warrant Officer Debra Mann. Their Black Hawk 
helicopters, officially designated transport, not attack, aircraft, 
carried troops into what turned out to be "hot" areas, where the PDF was 
firing on helicopters. For their participation in the assault Kutschera 
and Mann (and their male counterparts) would be awarded Air Medals--a much 
coveted decoration.<p>

At about the same time Kutschera and Mann were doing their jobs in the 
air, Captain Linda Bray, the commander of the 988th Military Police 
Company, was directing her unit to seize a Panamanian military dog kennel. 
Initial press reports stated that Captain Bray led a force of soldiers in 
a full-blown fire fight resulting in the deaths of three Panamanian 
soldiers. In fact no human casualties were suffered and what actually 
happened remains murky to this day. Still, the incident came to be 
portrayed as the first time a woman had led U.S. troops into combat.<p>

One other incident involving women soldiers in Panama also attracted 
attention. Press reports of female cowardice centered on two women truck 
drivers who allegedly refused orders to drive troops into areas where 
Panamanian snipers were active. A subsequent account put forth by the Army 
was quite different. After eight straight hours of driving during the 
invasion, the two drivers became concerned about whether they could 
continue to drive their vehicles safely. Tears were shed at some point. 
Fresh drivers replaced the two women. A subsequent investigation concluded 
that at no time was anyone derelict in her duty, and the incident was 
closed without disciplinary action.<p>

All told, some 800 female soldiers participated in the invasion of Panama, 
out of a total of 18,400 soldiers involved in the operation. Probably 
about 150 of the women were in the immediate vicinity of enemy fire. Owing 
to the publicity that women performing hazardous duty attracted, the 
once-dormant issue of the ban on women in combat units suddenly came awake.<p>

Title 10 of the U.S. Code precludes women from serving aboard combat 
vessels or aircraft. Although there are actually no statutory restrictions 
on how Army women can be deployed, the Army derived its combat-exclusion 
policy from Title 10 and prohibits women from joining direct combat units 
in the infantry, armor forces, cannon-artillery forces, and combat 
engineers. The Army's formal definition reads as follows: "Direct combat 
is engaging an enemy with individual or crew-served weapons while being 
exposed to direct enemy fire, a high probability of direct physical 
contact with the enemy's personnel, and a substantial risk of capture."<p>

Although many obstacles to women's participation in the military have been 
overcome, the line that excludes women from combat units has not yet been 
crossed. None of the women who participated in the Panama invasion, even 
those who came in harm's way, were assigned to combat units. Rather, they 
were serving as military police, medical and administrative staff, and 
members of transportation, communications, maintenance, and other support 
units.<p>




The issue of women in combat highlights the dramatic recent changes in the 
role of women in the military. Visitors at most military installations 
today will see women in numbers and roles unthinkable at the time the 
Vietnam War ended. Some 230,000 women now make up about 11 percent of all 
military personnel on active duty. Each branch of the military has a 
distinctive history with respect to women. The Air Force, which is 14 
percent female, has the highest proportion of jobs open to women, mainly 
because none of its ground jobs involve combat. Although women are 
precluded from piloting bombers and fighter planes, they fly transport 
planes and serve on the crews of refueling planes, such as those that took 
part in the 1986 U.S. raid on Libya. The Navy, which is 10 percent female, 
did not allow women on ships other than hospital ships until 1977, but 
today women sailors serve aboard transport and supply ships. The Marine 
Corps is only five percent female, because a high proportion of its 
members serve in the combat arms. The Army, which is 11 percent female, 
has the largest total number of women (86,000), and is the vanguard 
service insofar as the role of women is concerned.<p>

My research as a military sociologist has allowed me to observe at close 
hand the changing face of the Army since my days as a draftee, in the late 
1950s. The account that follows, which briefly surveys the life, the 
sentiments, and the aspirations of women in the U.S. Army, draws upon my 
observations of Army units around the world but is based mainly on 
interviews with soldiers of every rank who participated in the invasion of 
Panama, including most of the women soldiers who were closest to the 
shooting.<p>


<b>SOME BACKGROUND</b><p>

When the Second World War broke out, the only women in the armed services 
were nurses. But manpower needs caused the precursor to the Women's Army 
Corps (WAC) to be established in May of 1942, followed shortly thereafter 
by the Navy's WAVES (Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service) and 
the Coast Guard's SPARs (from "Semper Paratus: Always Ready"). Women were 
allowed into the Marine Corps in 1943, and, refreshingly, these volunteers 
were called simply Women Marines. Some 800 civilian women who served as 
Air Force service pilots flew military aircraft across the Atlantic. The 
Women in the Air Force (WAF) was created in 1948, after the Air Force had 
become a separate service.<p>

The Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948 gave permanent status 
to military women, but with the proviso that there would be a two-percent 
ceiling on the proportion of women in the services (excluding nurses). No 
female generals or admirals were to be permitted. For the next two decades 
women averaged only a little over one percent of the armed forces, and 
nearly all of them did "traditional" women's work, in health-care and 
clerical jobs. During the Vietnam War some 7,500 women served in Vietnam, 
mostly in the Army. The names of eight women are engraved on the Vietnam 
Veterans Memorial, in Washington, D.C.<p>

Starting in the 1970s a series of barriers fell in relatively rapid 
succession. On June 11, 1970, women were promoted to the rank of general 
for the first time in U.S. history. The new generals were Anna Mae Hayes, 
of the Army Nurse Corps, and Elizabeth P. Hoisington, the director of the 
WACs. Women first entered the Reserve Officer Training Corps on civilian 
college campuses in 1972. Much more traumatic was the admission in 1976 of 
the first female cadets into the service academies. Today one of seven 
entrants to West Point is female, although, if truth be told, most of the 
male cadets are not yet reconciled to the presence of women. Congress 
abolished the WACs in 1978, leading to the direct assignment of women 
soldiers to non-combat branches of the Army. Today 86 percent of all 
military occupational specialties (MOSes) for enlisted personnel are open 
to women.<p>

To put the combat-exclusion rule into practice and minimize the 
possibility that women in noncombat MOSes would be assigned to areas where 
they received hostile fire, the Army in 1983 implemented a system of 
direct-combat-probability coding (DCPC). The purpose of the probability 
code is to exclude female soldiers, whatever their MOS, from areas where 
they are likely to be, to use formal Army terminology, "collocated" with 
troops in direct combat. But once assigned to an area, Army policy states, 
female soldiers "in the event of hostilities will remain with their 
assigned units and continue to perform their assigned duties." This is 
what happened in Panama with the female helicopter pilots, military 
police, and truck drivers who came under fire. (In contrast, during the 
1983 American invasion of Grenada four military policewomen were sent to 
the island with their unit only to be sent right back to Fort Bragg 
because of the fighting on the island.) DCPC is based on a linear concept 
of warfare, as is clear from the guideline that women soldiers not be 
assigned to positions found "forward of the brigade rear boundary"--that 
is, not close to the front lines. The coding is hard to reconcile with 
checkerboard combat theaters, however. Two of the twenty-three Americans 
killed in the Panama operation were in noncombat MOSes--a medic and a 
military policeman--as were thirty-six of the 324 wounded. One of the 
wounded was a printing and bindery specialist. None of the killed or 
wounded soldiers were women.<p>


<b>A GLIMPSE OF DAILY LIFE</b><p>

I flew down to Panama shortly after the invasion and, with the Army's 
permission, talked to scores of soldiers and investigated their living 
conditions. The enlistment motivations of the men and women I spoke to 
differed in important respects. For the typical male, economic realities 
were predominant. Most admitted to having seen few job opportunities in 
civilian life. The decision to enlist was usually supported by family and 
friends. For many of the men, joining the Army seemed to be the path of 
least resistance. The women soldiers were much more likely to have entered 
the military for noneconomic reasons. They also seemed to be more 
independent and adventurous than the men. Often they had not received much 
encouragement from their parents to join the service. Many of the men, and 
even more of the women, were attracted by the Army's post-service 
educational benefits. For the women, joining the Army was the result of a 
decision to "do something different" and get away from a "boring" 
existence in some backwater community.<p>

Sitting on her bunk in an extremely hot and stuffy room in an old PDF 
barracks, one female Private First Class told a not unusual story: "I 
worked for a while right after high school and then went to a community 
college. But with working so much, I couldn't be a real student. I quit 
school and worked as a waitress at a Denny's. I woke up one day and 
realized I wasn't going anywhere. There had to be more to life than this. 
I was afraid I would end up marrying some jerk. The Army offered me a GI 
Bill and a chance to do something different. My mother cried when I told 
her I was going to join the Army. But I did it anyway and I'm glad. I 
won't stay in, but I've seen and done a lot more things than my friends 
back home."<p>

Many of the women had spent time on field maneuvers, living in tents. 
Since most of the women were assigned to combat-support functions, they 
were often able to live in large general-purpose tents. Work sections 
sleep together in one tent during field exercises whenever possible. This 
is true whether sections are male-only or mixed-sex. Women drape blankets 
over a rope between the main tent poles to gain some privacy, although 
someone on the other side can easily peer over the top. In mixed-sex tents 
the men generally display some regard for privacy, although not always as 
much as the women would like. Most of the women sleep in gym clothes or 
their BDUs (battle dress uniforms), as fatigues are now called. Others 
become acrobats and manage to change clothes inside their sleeping bags. 
Almost all the women said they would prefer to sleep in a mixed-sex tent 
with workmates rather than in a female-only tent with strangers.<p>

Personal cleanliness and hygiene are of much greater concern to women than 
to men in the field. Even under the tense, busy circumstances of Panama, 
the women tried to bathe once a day. One young female soldier insisted 
(wrongly) to me that Army regulations guarantee women a shower at least 
once every three days. How to wash became almost an obsession for women in 
the field. One method was to post a guard outside a tent and take a "bird 
bath," using a can of hot water. One unit moved garbage cans inside the 
tent for the women to use as stand-up bathtubs. When outside shower 
facilities were all that was available, women often showered in their 
BDUs. Female soldiers are expected to plan ahead and provide their own 
sanitary napkins or tampons. In Panama tampons had to be drawn from the 
medical-supply system rather than the regular quartermaster system. This 
created problems for some women in the early days of the invasion. But 
once life began to return to normal, tampons (and women's underwear) could 
be readily bought at the post exchange. All in all, menstruation did not 
seem to worry the female soldiers I spoke with, and it was never invoked 
as an excuse for absence from work.<p>




Sexual harassment is one of the issues most frequently discussed by women 
in the military. Enlisted women and female officers differ on this matter 
in important ways. Enlisted women, like most men of any rank, define 
sexual harassment mainly in terms of sexual propositions and actual 
touching. One female sergeant put it this way: "Sexual harassment is 
making unwelcome advances the second time." Enlisted women also tend to 
see sexual harassment in almost fatalistic terms, something that "goes 
with the territory" and is often brought on by the behavior of the woman. 
But they do not consider every advance to be harassment. Fraternization 
between men and women among enlisted personnel in the Army (and among Army 
officers) is as common as it is among students at a coeducational college, 
and is accepted as normal if it occurs among soldiers (or officers) of the 
same rank. Most women soldiers who have boyfriends have boyfriends who are 
soldiers, and the women who are married are far more likely to be married 
to soldiers than married male soldiers are.<p>

Female officers understand sexual harassment in much broader terms, to 
include sexist remarks, sex-based definitions of suitable work, the 
combat-exclusion rule, and so on. Women officers see sexism in the 
military as something that requires constant vigilance. One lieutenant 
told me that she found it a "welcome challenge to deal with male 
chauvinists on a daily basis."<p>

Another form of sexual harassment was mentioned by the enlisted women: 
approaches from lesbians. The true incidence of lesbianism (and of male 
homosexuality) in the military is unknown. There are indications that 
lesbianism is more widespread in the armed forces than is male 
homosexuality. Defense Department statistics, whether they reflect 
selective prosecution or not, show that women are discharged for 
lesbianism almost ten times as often, proportionately, as men are 
discharged for homosexuality. Accounts of lesbianism were offered 
spontaneously in most of my extended interviews with female soldiers. My 
general impression was that lesbianism causes much less alarm among women 
soldiers than homosexuality does among the men. Whereas male soldiers 
expressed disdain for homosexuals with sardonic humor if not threats of 
violence, the women were more likely to espouse an attitude of live and 
let live.<p>

That enlisted women must face being characterized by many men in the 
military as either loose or lesbian is an unfortunate reality. These 
attitudes decline markedly when men and women work together over the long 
term. Such situations also seem eventually to bring out the best in the 
men. But sex-related issues by no means pervade the everyday existence of 
female soldiers. The most common topics of concern and conversation, for 
both sexes, appear to have little to do with sex. They have to do with the 
work of the Army and with the good and bad of military life.<p>


<B>SERGEANTS, OFFICERS, AND ENLISTED WOMEN</B><p>

The Army's noncommissioned officers inhabit the middle ground between the 
enlisted ranks and the officer corps. If women sometimes occupy an 
ambiguous position within the military, female NCOs occupy the most 
ambiguous position of all. One reason is that there are not many of them: 
only four percent of all senior sergeants are women.<p>

One Sergeant First Class I interviewed, a personnel specialist, joined the 
Army in 1972. She told me, "I wanted to see the world, and I sure 
have--Korea, Germany; and now Panama. I was glad to see the WACs go. There 
were too many cliques and too much politics. The real problem now is that 
the female NCO is never taken as seriously as the male. Every time we are 
reassigned to a new unit, we have to prove ourselves all over again. Our 
credentials aren't portable like the men's."<p>

Like many female NCOs, this woman admits to having few close friends in 
the military. "If you get too close to the men, they think you're having 
an affair. If you hang around with women, they think you're a lesbian. 
Let's face it, you can't really be one of the boys. The kind of insults 
men throw at each other a woman can't do, unless she wants to cross an 
invisible line of respect." The sergeant finally brought up the matter of 
marriage, which weighs heavily with female careerists in the Army: "I 
never married," she said, "because I just couldn't think of having 
children and making a go of an Army career." Only 60 percent of female 
senior NCOs are married, and of those only half have children. A military 
career works powerfully on military women to keep them single and 
childless.<p>

Above the rank of noncommissioned officers in the Army is the officer 
corps, where today one lieutenant in six is female--but only one colonel 
in thirty. Only three of the Army's 407 general officers are women. Women 
officers feel the same pressures not to marry or raise children that 
female NCOs do--pressures that male soldiers do not feel. Many women 
officers believe that the demands of an Army career preclude having 
children, and they leave the service. Others make the Army a career, 
deciding to stay childless. A female helicopter pilot told me, "Having no 
children is the sacrifice I make to keep flying." In 1989 among male 
senior officers 94 percent were married, and 90 percent of these had 
children; among female senior officers only 51 percent were married, and 
only half of these had children.<p>

A small but growing group of junior female officers, however, seems to 
have devised a form of planned parenthood that can accommodate both family 
and career. It works like this. First, aim to be a company commander, an 
important "ticket to be punched" on the way up the promotion ladder. 
Company commanders are usually captains with six or seven years in 
service, people in their late twenties. Company command is a high-pressure 
job, but it is often followed by a slack time, such as an assignment to an 
ROTC position or a staff job in a headquarters command. Women officers are 
coming to regard this period as the most opportune to have a child.<p>




Almost all junior officers today are commissioned right after college. 
This contrasts with the biographies of today's senior women officers, who 
entered as WACs, often after some work experience. Brigadier General 
Evelyn "Pat" Foote, who was one of the Army's most senior women officers 
when she retired, last year, was well known in the military for being an 
outstanding and confident professional officer who spoke her mind. She 
joined the Army at age thirty after a string of white-collar jobs in 
which, she told me, she always seemed to be "somebody's girl Friday." In 
her nearly three decades in the Army, Foote served as the commander of a 
WAC company, as a public-affairs officer in Vietnam, as a faculty member 
at the Army War College, and as the commander of the Military Police Group 
in Mannheim, West Germany. She concluded her career as the commanding 
general of Fort Belvoir, Virginia. She has never married.<p>

Foote espouses a philosophy that is embraced by most senior women 
officers, at least in private. They hope for a future that harks back to 
an era when women soldiers, in the main, were unmarried, had no children 
and few outside distractions, and were more committed to military service 
than their male counterparts. By now, of course, this is simply too much 
to expect of female career soldiers.<p>

Foote recognizes that many Army women have been able to combine a military 
career, marriage, and children. She is adamant that there is little place 
in the Army for single pregnant women and single mothers. Certainly having 
pregnant soldiers in deployable units is "the height of folly." In 1988 
eight percent of the total female enlisted force bore children; some 15 
percent of all enlisted Army women are single parents. Before 1975 
pregnant women were routinely discharged from the Army. Today, although 
pregnant women are ineligible for enlistment, they can remain in the Army 
if already enlisted. No one knows for sure, but informed sources believe 
that about a third of pregnant soldiers elect to have their babies and 
stay in the Army; the women are granted a six-week maternity leave. 
Another third have abortions and remain in the Army. The remainder leave 
the service after delivery.<p>

Foote would "feel comfortable" with a rule that expelled pregnant women 
but allowed waivers on a case-by-case basis. She also notes the problem of 
pregnant women who carry on too long with their duties to the detriment of 
themselves and their babies. Single parents too often present "an 
untenable mess," Foote says. "Anyone, male or female, who can't perform 
their mission has no place in the Army." She ruefully notes that female 
officers were never consulted on the changes that allowed pregnant women 
and single parents to remain in the Army. The "male hierarchy caved in to 
so-called liberals without thinking what this would mean for Army 
readiness." <p>


<B>WHAT ABOUT COMBAT?</B><p>

The various arguments for and against women in combat are complex, and the 
issues involved are not subject to easy empirical resolution. Whether the 
propensity of most males to be more aggressive than most females is due 
mainly to body chemistry or to cultural conditioning is a matter of 
controversy; so is whether male bonding is chemical or cultural. There are 
social realities that need be considered, however. We should not forget, 
for example, that combat troops live, bathe, and sleep together for days 
and weeks on end. No institution in American society forces men and women 
into such unrelentingly close contact. That women could be killed or 
captured in war is a specter raised by those who oppose letting women into 
combat units. Is this really an issue? Female police officers have died in 
the line of duty without raising any particular outcry. On the touchy 
matter of prisoners of war, we have seen at least a symbolic change. In 
1988 President Ronald Reagan signed an executive order revising the Code 
of Conduct for POWs. What formerly began with "I am an American fighting 
man" was changed to the gender-neutral and less bellicose "I am an 
American."<p>

What we do know a lot about are differences between the sexes in physical 
strength and endurance. Statistically speaking, average female upper-body 
strength is 42 percent less than average male upper-body strength. Looked 
at another way, the statistics mean that on the average the top fifth of 
women in lifting capacity are the equal of the bottom fifth of men on the 
same measure. This means that any work requiring heavy lifting or carrying 
a great deal of weight--the burden of the combat soldier--puts women at a 
serious disadvantage. Opponents of the combat-exclusion rule point out 
that much of modern warfare is technological and "push-button" and does 
not require the brute strength of the combat soldier of old. There is some 
truth to this. But women are already allowed in almost all areas of 
technological warfare, including holding the launching keys of nuclear 
missiles. The irreducible fact remains that physical strength and 
endurance are still the hallmarks of the effective combat soldier on the 
ground; indeed, such qualities may be more important in the future, when 
we make use of rapid-deployment forces, whose members must carry most of 
their equipment on their backs.<p>

Experience from foreign countries is not very enlightening on the matter 
of women in combat. Contrary to popular belief, women in Israel, which is 
the only country with a female draft, are not assigned to duty as combat 
soldiers; they played only a limited, mainly defensive, role in the War of 
Independence, in 1948. A ruling by Canada's Human Rights Commission last 
year held that women could no longer be excluded from any military role 
except in submarines. The Canadian experience has not been heartening for 
those who seek to end the combat-exclusion rule in this country. Only 
seventy-nine women were recruited into the infantry training program and 
only one completed the course. She has since requested a transfer out of 
the infantry.<p>

For all this, it is probably the case that most senior female officers 
privately second the views of General Foote on the subject of women and 
combat. Foote favors opening all roles to women in the Army, even in the 
combat arms. Being a woman per se should not, she says, be a 
disqualification for any military job. Of course, Foote recognizes the 
differences in strength between men and women. She acknowledges that few 
women belong in the infantry, and probably not many more belong in the 
armor or artillery, but says that certainly some could perform well in 
those roles, and there is no good reason to exclude women from combat 
aviation. Her basic position is this: "Never compromise standards. Be sure 
that anybody in any MOS can do everything required in that MOS."<p>

The problem with the combat-exclusion rule, Foote argues, is that it 
"develops a whole male cadre and officer corps that doesn't know how to 
work with women." So long as officers in the combat branches are 
practicing "a different sheet of music," she says, they will not know how 
to use women to their full capabilities. At the very least the 
direct-combat-probability code--"the most counterproductive policy in the 
U.S. Army"--ought to be abolished, she says, because it prevents trained 
and qualified women from performing their assignments where they are 
needed.<p>




How female officers and enlisted personnel variously gauge their future 
Army career opportunities makes for differing views on women in combat. 
Female officers see their career opportunities as diminishing as they 
become more senior. Without a chance for command assignments in combat 
units, the women officers believe, their careers are limited, especially 
by comparison with men's careers. Although a government study released 
last year showed that women are promoted at a rate similar to that for 
men, the fact remains that the combat-exclusion rule precludes any 
significant number of women from becoming generals, or even full colonels. 
Among the female officers I talked with in Panama, about three quarters 
believed that qualified women should be allowed to volunteer for combat 
units and about a quarter said that women should be compelled to enter 
combat units, just as men are. A female military-police officer expressed 
the sentiments of most: "If a woman has the capability and gumption to 
enter a combat unit, I'd say go for it. Few of us could make it in the 
infantry. God forbid that the Army shoehorn women into the infantry to 
meet some kind of quota. But a woman is as brave as a man, and we 
shouldn't be kept out of jobs we could do, no matter what the danger. 
Military women are their own worst enemy by accepting a lowering of 
physical standards. If we kept standards up, if we kept pregnant women 
out, then any woman in any MOS would be assigned wherever she was needed 
when the balloon goes up."<p>

Enlisted women, on the other hand, are less subject to career 
disappointment, because their expectations are not high to begin with. 
Inasmuch as they generally did not see themselves in long-term Army roles, 
the women I spoke with thought of their service in Panama as a 
one-time-only adventure. Enlisted women foresaw their eventual life's 
meaning in family, in work outside the military, or, if in the military, 
in relatively sedentary and routine jobs. Among the enlisted women I 
interviewed in Panama, about three quarters said that women should not be 
allowed in combat units and about a quarter said that women who were 
physically qualified should be allowed to volunteer for combat roles. None 
of the enlisted women favored forcing women into combat assignments. One 
female driver gave a typical enlisted woman's response: "I'm 
old-fashioned. I want to be treated like a woman. I don't want people to 
think I'm a man. I certainly wouldn't want to be in the infantry. A normal 
woman can't carry a rucksack that the guys can. Even if we could, the guys 
would hate us for being there. And, let's face it, we would probably make 
things harder on everybody all around. No way."<p>

There is one area where the combat-exclusion rule is questioned by most 
women and some men: piloting helicopters. The skills required to fly a 
utility helicopter to transport soldiers into hot zones are not really all 
that different from those required on gunships such as Cobras and Apaches. 
In Panama the skills of the female pilots were acknowledged by all to be 
at least the equal of those of the male pilots. Even the British high 
command, that most traditional of general staffs, is studying the 
possibility of allowing women to train as pilots for Harriers, the 
jump-jet fighters that saw so much action in the Falklands War. Were women 
to be assigned to U.S. gunships in future hostilities, however, they would 
almost surely suffer casualties. Even in the small, short war in Panama 
four helicopters were shot down and many more were hit by enemy fire.<p>

Two things came out loud and clear in my Panama interviews. One is that 
the worst thing for a woman officer is to be removed from an assignment 
she has trained for simply because there is danger. A helicopter pilot 
told me how she felt on invasion day when she was denied a flight 
assignment that she thought was her due: "I was insane with anger. After 
nine years of training they left me out. It was the ultimate slam." The 
second point is that not a single woman, officer or enlisted, said that 
she would volunteer to be an infantry rifleman. Surely, somewhere in the 
U.S. Army, there are women who would volunteer for the infantry. But they 
were not in Panama.<p>


<B>THE UNASKED QUESTION</B><p>

Women in the military have been a troublesome issue for feminists. 
Feminists have also been troublesome for women in the military. Most 
feminists clearly want women to share equally the rights and burdens of 
service, but many of them abhor the combat role of the military profession 
and much of the basic direction of American foreign policy, which the 
military profession serves. That many of those who opposed the Panama 
invasion also advocate combat roles for women is indeed ironic. Female 
officers are understandably distrustful of much of the civilian feminist 
agenda, with its not-so-veiled anti-military content. Even as they chart 
new ground in opportunities for women, female officers are unquestionably 
less liberal politically, on average, than their civilian counterparts.<p>

Where mainstream feminists and senior women officers come together is in 
their wish to do away with, or at least punch holes in, the categorical 
exclusion of women from direct combat roles. They see the exclusion as 
somehow precluding women from full citizenship. Following the Panama 
invasion and the reports of women in combat, the push to remove the last 
barriers to women's full participation in the military gained new 
momentum. Representative Patricia Schroeder, a senior Democrat on the 
House Armed Services Committee, proposed legislation to set up a trial 
program to test the suitability of women for the combat arms. Such a 
program had been recommended in 1989 by the Defense Advisory Committee on 
Women in the Services. Last April the Army announced that it would not 
initiate such a trial program. But the Army's decision will not put the 
issue to rest. As long as there are women in the military, the pressures 
to end the combat-exclusion rule will remain.<p>

On the surface, the proposal for a trial program sounds eminently 
reasonable. How can we know whether women will measure up to the stresses 
of combat without assigning them to combat training and seeing what 
happens? Admittedly, training is not the same as actual combat, but a 
pilot program would tell us more than we know now.<p>

There is another matter to consider, however. Let us assume that the 
presence of women in combat units can be shown not to affect adversely the 
combat performance of the men in those units. Let us also assume that in 
the event of hostilities the death of female soldiers would not cause much 
more upset at home than the death of male soldiers. And let us assume that 
a pilot program will be established and that it will show some number of 
women to have the physical and psychological endurance to perform well in 
combat, or at least as well as some men already in combat roles. Given all 
this, the pressure to remove the ban on women in combat units will be 
difficult to resist. But will allowing qualified women to enter the combat 
arms finally mean the resolution of this nettlesome issue? <p>

Unfortunately, no. The issue is not simply "opening up" combat assignments 
to military women. The core question--the one avoided in public debate, 
but the one that the women soldiers I spoke with in Panama were all too 
aware of--is this: Should every woman soldier be made to confront exactly 
the same combat liabilities as every man? All male soldiers can, if need 
arises, be assigned to the combat arms, whatever their normal postings. 
True equality would mean that women soldiers would incur the same 
liability. To allow women but not men the option of entering or not 
entering the combat arms would--rightly or wrongly--cause immense 
resentment among male soldiers; in a single stroke it would diminish the 
status and respect that female soldiers have achieved. To allow both sexes 
to choose whether or not to go into combat would be the end of an 
effective military force. Honesty requires that supporters of lifting the 
ban on women in combat state openly that they want to put all female 
soldiers at the same combat risk as all male soldiers--or that they don't.<p>

A trial program of women in combat roles which shows that women can hold 
their own in battle may put one argument to rest. But it will signal the 
start of another.<p>

	<i><font size=4>An Englishman takes an alarmed look at a quintessentially American issue</i></font><p>

	

	

	<pre>

	

	</pre>

	

	<font size=5>I</font>n the late 1940s, when the Marshall Plan was being debated in Congress, Arthur

Vandenberg, presenting the plan on the floor of the Senate, summoned up a

vision of "270,000,000 people of the stock which has largely made America." He

insisted, "This vast friendly segment of the earth must not collapse. The iron

curtain must not come to the rim of the Atlantic either by aggression or by

default."<p>



<p>



Nearly fifty years later Peter Brimelow, an Englishman by birth and a senior

editor of Forbes magazine, has summoned up another vision of danger to the

common European-American stock. Comparing himself to the Thomas Paine of Common

Sense, he warns that the survival of the American nation-state is in peril to a

degree scarcely seen since revolutionary days. Unless radical corrective

measures are quickly taken, he says, unchecked Third World immigration will

overwhelm the United States--its culture, its economy, and its ethnic

identity--within a matter of a few decades. European-Americans will be just one

more minority group in a nation that few of today's Americans, whatever their

ethnicity, would any longer recognize. <p>



<p>



Brimelow's vision of Europe and the United States (and, in particular, Britain

and the United States) as ethnic brethren may seem as dated as Vandenberg's in

the multicultural America of today. But in the national debate on immigration

that may well dominate the 1996 presidential campaign, Euro-American

nationality could be championed as the American nationality par excellence

(rather than by default) by a majority that has belatedly discovered it wants

to remain a majority. For that campaign Peter Brimelow has written what may

prove to be an indispensable book. <p>



<p>



This is so in part because of the highly contentious form the book takes.

Brimelow serves up one imagined debaters' duel after another, with the final

thrust invariably delivered by the author's side. Consider, for example, the

following:<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

You hear a lot about PhD immigrants working in California's Silicon Valley

computer complex. Just under 3 percent of recent immigrants had PhDs, as

opposed to just over 1 percent of native-born Americans. But that's only, say,

30,000 immigrant PhDs a year. And have you heard that surveys show some 10

percent of Mexican illegal immigrants . . . were totally illiterate in any

language? <p>



You haven't? Oh. <p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





Of his eristic method Brimelow writes,<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

Part of the cultural diversity I bring to the United States from Britain is a

certain (ahem) contempt for American debating technique. I can't help it. It's

inbred.<p>



American competitive debaters are given their topics in advance and earnestly

learn all the arguments by heart. But British competitive debaters are told

their topics, and which side they must take, only at the last moment. They are

expected to succeed by quickness of wit and whatever facts they can dredge (or

make) up.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





What Americans feel toward the English high style in debate is, I suspect,

rather like what the English feel toward the clever French: we admire the

biting humor, the hard brilliance, but we doubt the underlying substance, and

we recoil in particular from the emphasis on wittily destroying an opponent

rather than patiently and dialectically exposing all aspects of some important

subject. This is why in the long run William F. Buckley Jr.'s faintly English

accent and acid English wit have limited rather than enhanced the trust he

enjoys even among his ideological allies. In these matters, for better and

worse, America is Roundhead and plain, England Cavalier and fancy. <p>



<p>



Ironically, however, Brimelow has produced a Cavalier briefing book well suited

to the needs of Roundhead controversialists who, in the plodding American

manner, will want to be prepared for anything the coming immigration debate may

require of them. Brimelow calls the contending parties, with polemical panache,

"immigration enthusiasts" and "patriots." Others have used the more neutral

terms "admissionists" and "restrictionists." But either party may profitably

imbibe this bottled brio. One side will be confirmed, the other forearmed.

Some of Brimelow's claims seem unproved, however intriguing--for example, his

observation that America's ethnic groups are sorting themselves out by 

region.<p>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

California . . . is being abandoned by lower-income whites in particular,

exactly the group that would appear to be most vulnerable to competition from

unskilled immigrants. Much of this white flight is flocking to the

intermountain West, which seems likely to emerge as part of America's white

heartland.  <p>



Less noticed, minorities are polarizing too. Asians move to

California's Bay Area--they now make up 29.1 percent of San Francisco

County--and to the Los Angeles megalopolis, even if they originally settled in

other parts of the United States. <p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





Brimelow might have added that some blacks are returning to the South. Still,

if it is difficult to maintain the character of even an ethnic neighborhood in

a highly mobile society, will it not be all the more difficult to establish and

maintain an entire ethnic region?<p>





A more serious issue, though amusing enough in Brimelow's telling, is

immigration reciprocity. Brimelow formally inquired into the possibility of

emigrating to several of the countries that send the most immigrants to the

United States, and shares with us what he was told. Here are some of the

opening sentences:<p>



<I>China</I>: "China does not accept any immigrants. We have a large enough

population."<p>





<I>Mexico</I>: "Unless you are hired by a Mexican company that obtains a temporary

work permit, or a retiree older than sixty-five who can prove financial

self-sufficiency, you must get a six-month tourist visa <I>and apply in person to

the Ministry of the Interior in Mexico City</I>."<p>





<I>South Korea</I>: "Korea does not accept immigrants."<p>



<I>Jamaica</I>: "You cannot simply immigrate to Jamaica."<p>





<I>Egypt</I>: "Egypt is not an immigrant country." <p>





But if, as so many claim, immigrants contribute more to the economy than they

cost, Brimelow asks, why are these countries not eager for

immigration--particularly for a highly skilled, well-capitalized immigrant like

him? The size of the population should have nothing to do with it.<p>





One admissionist response might be that these countries should indeed encourage

immigration and would be economically better off if they did so. A likelier

admissionist response would be "America is different": these countries may

rightly claim that they are not nations of immigrants, but America has a

different tradition. Historically, however, as Brimelow effectively shows, the

United States has experienced intermittent rather than continuous immigration.

Twice in the past we have deliberately interrupted the flow. We could do so

again.<p>

<br>



<font size=5>S</font>HOULD we? This is the central question of the book and of the upcoming

national debate. Before that question is asked, however, the mistaken belief

that large-scale legal immigration to the United States is a purely natural

phenomenon should first be corrected. Heavy immigration has not just happened.

It has come about through political decisions. Many Americans remember the

Civil Rights Act of 1964. Too few remember the Immigration and Nationality Act

Amendments of 1965. At the time, proponents of the new law, which ended

national quotas and introduced the family-reunification principle, confidently

predicted that it would bring about neither any dramatic increase in

immigration nor any significant change in the ethnic makeup of the United

States. Had either change been predicted, the law would not have passed.<p>





Both changes, however, are now accomplished fact. In 1990, Brimelow reports, a

staggering 1.5 million legal immigrants were admitted, of whom only eight

percent came from Europe, including some en route from Asia or the Caribbean by

way of Europe. In 1960 the U.S. population was 88.6 percent white. By 1990 the

percentage of whites had dropped to 75.6, and the Bureau of the Census

forecasts a further drop, to 64 percent by 2020 and to 53 percent by 2050.

Without congressional action this would not have happened. Do we want it to

continue happening? <p>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

In other words: let's suppose that it would indeed be impolite to raise the

question of ethnic balance--if a shift were occurring due to the unaided

efforts of one's fellow Americans, resulting in different birthrates for

different groups.<p>





But how can it be impolite to mention it when the shift is due to the arrival

of unprecedented numbers of foreigners--arbitrarily and accidentally selected

by a government that specifically and repeatedly [in 1965] denied it was doing

any such thing?<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>







If by decision or inaction this process continues, then America will indeed be

different--not just different from what it has been but different from every

other nation in the world in its radical openness to immigration. No other

nation, as Brimelow's queries about emigration make clear, permits immigration

by the hundreds of thousands annually on criteria no more compelling than

"family reunification." None would dream of countenancing a tremendous

demographic transformation for that reason alone.<p>





If the United States chooses to make itself truly the great exception, the

implications are virtually endless, one of them being a potentially profound

transformation of black-white relations, as "now, suddenly, there are new

minorities, each with their own grievances and attitudes--<I>quite possibly

including a lack of guilt about, and even hostility toward, blacks</I>."<p>





In this regard Brimelow may be saying more than he realizes. Within living

memory virtually all who immigrated to the United States became citizens, and

all who became citizens took on American history as their own. Numerous poems

and stories have been written over the years about the comedy and poignancy of

this process. But more-recent immigrants, by no means excluding immigrants from

Europe, evince little enthusiasm for what Lincoln called the "unfinished work"

of building a nation on "the proposition that all men are created equal." They

hold or divest U.S. citizenship on the basis of tax-savings yield just as some

native-born Americans have done. Their attitude bodes ill for the United States

as other than a business arrangement and particularly ill for what Gunnar

Myrdal called the "American dilemma" of race relations after slavery.<p>





Perhaps a few Americans formally espouse the view that their country is not

truly a nation but only a political system, a kind of inherited calculus for

reconciling the interests of a group of nations (or ethnic groups, to use the

domestic designation) occupying a single territory. But even if we wish the

United States to be no more than that, can we get away with it? Can the

American political system--the polity, the state--survive the demise of the

American nation? The state has survived past peaks of immigration by relying on

the nation to assimilate the immigrants culturally. But if the nation can no

longer assimilate new groups because it has itself become no more than a group

of unassimilated, contending cultures, how will the state survive a continuous

heavy influx?<p>





Assimilation itself has come into some disrepute. Proponents of

multiculturalism want to preserve the immigrant cultures and even languages

rather than see them absorbed by a host culture. Even the mutual assimilation

or accommodation of native-born groups one to another, though it continues, is

questioned. The melting pot, once celebrated, is now sometimes reviled. Other

metaphors--the mosaic, the salad--are preferred. True, some foresee a less

separatist, more mutually appreciative multiculturalism--a new cosmopolitanism,

if you will--on the far side of multiculturalism as we now know it. But will

the new cosmopolitanism mature soon enough to guarantee the minimum cultural

coherence that political coherence requires?<p>



<p>



If there is any question about that, and, more important, if there is a serious

question about whether immigration confers any economic benefits whatsoever,

shouldn't the United States sharply curtail immigration, just to be on the safe

side, given the other risks and stresses that accompany it?<p>



<p>



<font size=5>U</font>NSURPRISINGLY, Brimelow believes that there is indeed a serious question about

whether immigration confers any economic benefits. Surprisingly, however, and

perhaps prudently, he goes no further than this. He attends to no single topic

at greater length than he does to economics, but he concludes that the economic

case against the status quo in American immigration must be built into the

cultural case against it. In the last paragraphs of the second of his two

chapters on the economic consequences of immigration, he summarizes as

follows:<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

It's a simple exercise in logic:<BR>



1. Capitalism (and no doubt every other economic system) needs specific

cultural prerequisites to function;<BR>



2. Immigration can alter the cultural patterns of a society. THEREFORE--<BR>



3. Immigration can affect a society's ability to sustain capitalism.<P>



Let's leave the last word with [the economist] George Borjas . . . : "The

economic arguments for immigration simply aren't decisive," he says. "You have

to make a political case--for example, does the U.S. have to take Mexican

immigrants to provide a safety valve?"<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





Brimelow is a financial journalist and a political conservative. He knows

perhaps better than many liberal journalists that conservatives are divided

about the economic consequences of immigration. Robert Bartley, the editor of

The Wall Street Journal, notoriously favors open borders. Last November,

William Bennett and Jack Kemp, conservatives who had campaigned against

California's Proposition 187, gave the endorsement of their organization,

Empower America, to an "Immigration Index" produced by the conservative Center

for the New American Community. The index purports to show that, as Kemp put

it, "immigrants are a blessing, not a curse."<p>





Brimelow sees more curse than blessing. He observes, for example, that most

Third World immigrant-sending countries are without income-redistributing

social welfare. Accordingly, the ablest, richest people in those countries have

little reason to move to highly redistributionist Europe or the moderately

redistributionist United States. By the same token, the European poor have

reason to stay home and the Third World poor have reason to come here.<p>





Arguing against the importance of imported labor at any level of skill,

Brimelow points out that Japan's extraordinary economic development has come

about without the benefit of immigration. In a population of 125 million Japan

has perhaps 900,000 resident foreigners; in a population of 260 million the

United States has 23.4 million. And rumors to the contrary notwithstanding,

Japan is not about to change its policy. Here is the response Brimelow got to

his inquiry about emigrating to Japan:<p>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

ANONYMOUS JAPANESE OFFICIAL. (complete surprise and astonishment) "Why do you

want to emigrate to Japan? . . . There is no immigration to Japan. (Asked if

there aren't political refugees or asylum seekers) There might be three people

a year who become Japanese (chuckles). And even they don't stay long, they try

to emigrate elsewhere, like the U.S."<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





The Japanese have achieved economic success without immigration secondarily

because their high savings rate has assisted capital formation but primarily,

Brimelow says, because technical innovation is more important than either

capital or labor.<p>





Brimelow implies, however, and surely he is right, that Japan's immigration

policy is ultimately dictated by cultural rather than economic considerations.

When immigration policy comes down to dollars and cents alone, policy

formulation may be postponed indefinitely. Each side will have its economists,

and each month will provide new numbers to be crunched. Borjas (to whom

Brime-low's intellectual debt is enormous) is probably right: what politics has

done, politics must decide either to undo or to continue doing.<p>





<font size=5>B</font>RIMELOW himself is blunt about the political course he would have the nation

follow. Here are some of his recommendations:<p>



<UL>



  <LI>Double the size of the Border Patrol.<p>



  <LI>"Urgently" increase the size of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.<p>





  <LI>Institute a new Operation Wetback to expel illegal aliens.<p>





  <LI>If necessary, establish a national identity card.<p>



  <LI>Go beyond employer sanctions to the interdiction of money transfers by

illegals to their home countries.<p>



 <LI>Make it clear that there will never again be an amnesty for illegal

immigrants.<p>



  <LI>Discontinue immigration for the purposes of family reunification. If family

reunification is permitted at all, confine it to the nuclear family.<p>



  <LI>Move the INS from the Justice Department to the Labor Department, and make an

immigration applicant's skills the criterion for admission.<p>



  <LI>Institute an English-language requirement for immigrants.<p>



  <LI>Ban immigration from countries that do not permit reciprocal immigration from

the United States.<p>



  <LI>Cut legal immigration from the current one million or more annually to

400,000 (the 1972 Rockefeller Commission recommendation), 350,000 (the 1981

Theodore Hesburgh Select Commission recommendation), or 300,000 (the

recommendation of the Federation for American Immigration Reform), or to an

annual quota set by the Labor Department in response to the perceived needs of

the economy (the approach taken in Canada and Australia).<p>



  <LI>Cut back such special categories as refugee and "asylee."<p>



  <LI>See to it that no immigrant is eligible for preferential hiring, set-aside

college admission, or other forms of affirmative action aimed at historically

excluded groups. <p>



<LI>Replace the omnibus census category "Hispanic" with national-origin or racial

classifications as appropriate.<p>



  <LI>Consider repealing the citizenship-by-birth rule and lengthening the time of

legal residence before naturalization to five or ten years "or even to fourteen

years, as it was from 1798 to 1801."<p>



</UL>



I strongly agree with Brimelow that American immigration law needs to be

reformed severely and quickly. And many of his proposals make good sense.

However, his call for a new version of Operation Wetback--the hated federal

program that forced a million illegal Mexican immigrants to return to their

homeland in the 1950s--is worse than reckless. In a 40 percent Hispanic,

heavily armed city like Los Angeles, the mass expulsion of illegal Mexican

immigrants could not come about without a violent disruption of civic,

economic, and even religious order, and probably not without provoking a major

international incident. Such an operation could be implemented only at

gunpoint, and it would be resisted the same way. Its announcement would be a

virtual declaration of civil war.<p>



Since the American Revolution was a civil war, this Tom Paine redux may know

only too well what he is calling for. Returning to his hero in his closing

pages, he writes, <P>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

It is simply common sense that Americans have a legitimate

interest in their country's racial balance. It is common sense that they have a

right to insist that their government stop shifting it. <I>Indeed, it seems to me

that they have a right to insist that it be shifted back</I> [emphasis added].<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



In that passage the first two sentences may pass muster as common sense; the

last is pernicious nonsense.<p>



<font size=5>I</font>MMIGRATION as a political issue changed the course of the last gubernatorial

election in California, the nation's most populous state. In the next three

most populous states--New York, Texas, and Florida--the issue is only slightly

less salient. Among them, these four states virtually guarantee that the

immigration debate will play a central role in the next presidential election.

<p>



<p>



President Clinton and the new Republican leadership in Congress are proposing

different, rapidly evolving versions of a "National 187," imitating the

California citizens' initiative that seeks to deny most government services to

illegal aliens. Taking a further large step toward militant restrictionism, the

American Immigration Control Foundation, whose honorary advisory board is heavy

with retired military men, is distributing a questionnaire that includes the

following:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

America cannot control its borders because the U.S. Border Patrol has only

4,000 officers. That's not nearly enough manpower to control the flood of 3

MILLION illegals every year. Experts have proposed assigning 10,000 troops from

military bases near our borders (out of a total armed services of nearly

2,000,000) to assist Border Patrol officers in stopping the invasion of

illegals. <I>Do you favor such a proposal?</I><p>



Experts believe if Congress would assign as little as 2,000 military personnel

who have been forced to retire early because of defense cuts, but who still

want to serve our country, they could give tremendous assistance to our

seriously undermanned Border Patrol. <I>If such legislation was introduced in

Congress, would you favor passage of it?</I><p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





The Border Patrol itself would probably prefer to see the Armed Forces reduced

slightly and its own forces enlarged. But the same huge California majorities

that supported Proposition 187 would probably support the full militarization

of the border if asked--particularly if the recent devaluation of the peso

produces, as expected, a new flood of economic refugees from Mexico. But if

such an armed force were to cross over from guarding the border to rounding up

aliens for Brimelow's new Operation Wetback, I am confident that there would be

armed resistance. <p>





Has Brimelow completely forgotten the Rodney King riot? His suggestion that the

proportions of the population be shifted back (Back to just what? one asks)

strikes me as incendiary. I agree with him, as I have already said, that

current American immigration law is worse than unwise. It can and must be

revised, and the rate of immigration can and must be reduced. But even if, with

luck, the further effects of a bad law can be checked, we have no real choice

but to live with the effects to date of that law. And to do that we must create

a national culture that does not define any large portion of the citizenry as

American by sufferance.<p>



<p>



Brimelow manages to combine fear-mongering and tear-jerking when he 

writes,<P>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

The U.S. government officially projects an ethnic revolution in America.

Specifically, it expects that American whites will be on the point (53 percent)

of becoming a minority by 2050.<P>



 My little son Alexander will be fifty-nine.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





But little Alex and his kind already constitute only 75 percent of the

population. And if the boy takes after his dad and lives in dusky New York

rather than in that intermountain refuge for displaced palefaces which Brimelow

sees taking shape, then Brimelow fils will belong to an ethnic minority,

locally, long before 2050. How is he going to make his peace with that?<p>





Not, I fear, with much help from Brimelow pere, whose view of American culture

from its very origins is almost truculently Anglocentric. The black proportion

of the American population was greater at the time of the Revolutionary War (20

percent) than it is today. But Brimelow, who generally stresses the nation over

the state, defines blacks out of the revolutionary nation because at the time

they were defined out of the state. About the native population he has not a

word to say. One may grant the unwisdom of swamping the current American

population in new immigrants and yet insist that this nation is not now and

never has been culturally as English as Brimelow wants to believe. The

multicultural assignment, accordingly, is not one that this nation has taken on

gratuitously. From the start we have had no choice about it.<p>





Alexander, when he grows up, will have no choice about it either. It lies at

the heart of the ongoing American nation-building enterprise. American

(increasingly, even British) national identity is not a given. It is endlessly

constructed. And it is the multiculturalists, with all their faults, who have

taken this constructive enterprise in hand.<p>





Writing in a splendid twenty-year retrospective issue of Parnassus: Poetry in

Review, the poet Rita Dove offers a critical essay on the poet Derek Walcott

under the title, borrowed from Walcott, "Either I'm Nobody, or I'm a Nation."

The challenge that Walcott has faced, personally and artistically, is the

challenge of mixed identity; but if a black man born as a British subject on a

Caribbean island may be said to face the challenge of mixed identity in an

intense form, none of the rest of us, and certainly not Alexander Brimelow, can

hope to escape it. <p>



Culturally speaking, the key deformation of the oppressed is their confinement

in a merely private life. As regards the collective, public life, they are, to

borrow from Ralph Ellison, invisible men and women. But an artist may set

himself the nation-building task of embodying the invisible, private lives of

the minority and so delivering them into the visible, public life of the

majority. His goal, however, will be not just the incorporation of the minority

but also the reincorporation of the majority. The challenge is as much

intellectual as moral, and it is not mastered by sentimentality or

self-indulgence. Dove quotes an early autobiographical Walcott poem in which

the poet's surrogate "vows not to make his life 'public' '[u]ntil I have learnt

to suffer / In accurate iambics.'" By keeping his vow, Walcott has revised and

enlarged the Caribbean and the British identity alike.<p>





Brimelow has little truck with any of this. Few economists do. Unfortunately,

since he rests his case against continuing heavy immigration on cultural rather

than economic considerations, the omission matters considerably. Brimelow is

not entirely silent on this topic. He urges on his readers David Hackett

Fischer's huge Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America. But a more

revealing moment comes when he comments on the question of whether a million

Zulus would assimilate to American culture more easily than a million

Englishmen.<p>





This question was one of Pat Buchanan's contributions to the 1992 presidential

campaign. Addressing it, the Wall Street Journal columnist Paul Gigot wrote,

"The Zulus . . . would probably work harder than the English." To Gigot, the

line was clearly a moment of sardonic humor. But Brimelow fairly foams in

rebuttal. <p>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

It should not be necessary to explain that the legacy of Chaka, founder of the

Zulu Empire, who among other exploits killed all his concubines' children,

sometimes with his own hands, massacred some seven thousand of his own subjects

to mark his mother's death, sliced open a hundred pregnant women to satisfy a

fleeting interest in embryology, and ordered executions at whim daily until his

assassination . . . is not that of Alfred the Great, let alone that of

Elizabeth II or any civilized society.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





One would think that Gigot had been denouncing the uxoricides of Henry VIII

rather than chuckling over British work habits. The emotion in Brimelow's

reaction suggests, I believe, that an insufficiently examined personal agenda

has compromised the author's public agenda; and given the special intensity of

this issue, I fear that this personal agenda will do the public agenda no good.

I say this with regret, however, for the central legal reform to which Brimelow

calls his adopted country is one that desperately needs to be made.<p>





At his best, Peter Brimelow is an inspired controversialist, determined to

storm the enemy's redoubt where it is strongest, not where it is weakest. At

his worst, he manages to be sentimental and brutal at once, holding little

Alexander aloft on every tenth page while proposing a new Operation Wetback

that would tear hundreds of thousands of Mexican Alejandros and Alejandras from

hearth and home. Most at ease arguing the economics of the matter, he has the

courage to admit that the matter can have no economic resolution and the

greater courage to step forward as an apologist for the received Euro-American

culture.<p>





I regret that, having thus brought the matter to a cultural point, he goes no

further than he does in cultural analysis. But for all that, he makes a

powerful--indeed, nearly overwhelming--case against the status quo. And if his

book is at times uncomfortably personal, it is also painfully honest. Sometimes

it takes a personal book to make a public debate finally and fully public. This

could, just possibly, be one of those times.<p>

<blockquote>

	<i><font size=4>The industrial states must find a way to protect themselves from their own 

avarice: selling weapons to the Third World must stop</i></font><p>

	

	

	<pre>

	

	</pre>

	

	<font size=5>I</font>n the 1980s the Reagan Administration fastened on the term "the truly 

needy" to blunt public concern about cuts it had made in programs to help 

the merely needy. The Bush Administration has lately devised a 

foreign-policy equivalent: "weapons of mass destruction." In the wake of 

the Gulf War the Administration is against the proliferation of these 

weapons. It is much less resolutely against the proliferation of weapons 

of mere destruction, however. Indeed, even before the dust of the war had 

settled in the desert, teams of arms salesmen not only from the United 

States but also from Britain, France, West Germany, and other countries 

were flocking to the Middle East to tout their wares. They found plenty of 

willing buyers.<P>

Egypt has made clear that it would like to buy Hawk missiles, M-60 tank 

upgrades, and F-16 fighters. Israel wants portable battlefield-navigation 

systems, upgrades for the F-15 fighter and the M-109 artillery piece, and 

more Patriot missiles. The United Arab Emirates would like Abrams M1A1 

tanks and Patriot missiles, and so would Bahrain and Turkey.<P>

By far the biggest buyer will be Saudi Arabia, which is already in line to 

receive a $15 billion arms package including F-15 fighters, Apache 

helicopters, Abrams M1A1 tanks, AWACS radar planes, Patriot missiles, 

multiple-launch rocket systems, Seahawk helicopters, and Bradley fighting 

vehicles. This is on top of a $30 billion deal signed with Great Britain 

in 1988 for fighter aircraft, missiles, radars, airfields, and ships.<P>

Implicit in this brisk trade in arms is the idea that conventional warfare 

using weapons of mere destruction is in some way acceptable, whereas forms 

of warfare that use "weapons of mass destruction" are morally 

unacceptable. But with modern weapons the distinction between conventional 

and unconventional warfare has become blurred. The firepower of many 

modern conventional systems is so terrible that they, too, can be 

accurately described as weapons of mass destruction.<P>

The Western combatants, meanwhile, will now need to replenish the stocks 

that were expended in the war. When the procurement decisions are made, 

those weapons that performed well--lasers, microcomputers, standoff 

systems, Stealth technology--will be ordered. The production of these new 

weapons means that large numbers of the most modern weapons will come on 

the market and be sold to developing countries while manufacturers also 

seek rich customers who can afford the new systems, thus reducing unit 

cost and increasing profits. The replacement of old weapons by new in the 

arsenals of the West and the drive by arms manufacturers to hold down unit 

cost by finding more customers--this is the dynamic that has propelled the 

arms race for so long.<P>

Within that cycle an additional impetus drives the proliferation of 

conventional arms after the Gulf War. Defense contractors who supplied the 

allied forces believe that they have a new opportunity to market weapons 

that have been tested and proved in battle. At a time of shrinking defense 

budgets and contracts, exports could make up the shortfall for contractors 

who would otherwise be forced to shut down production lines and lay off 

workers. These manufacturers will have little interest in arguments about 

the morality of the arms business.<P>

And the West won't be the only seller in the postwar arms bazaar. As the 

Eastern

bloc countries reorganize their military forces and seek new sources of 

foreign exchange, they will try to produce more weapons for export and 

also to sell weapons from existing inventories. For example, 

Czechoslovakia last May announced plans to export 5,500 weapons, including 

tanks, artillery systems, and armored personnel carriers, which have to be 

removed from the Czech armed forces under the conventional-arms treaty. 

Rather than destroy these weapons, the Czechs are discussing selling the 

T-72 tanks to Syria and Iran and are looking for customers for the other 

weapons.<P>

The real challenge facing the world in the aftermath of the Gulf War and 

the Cold War is how to break out of the arms cycle that puts ever more 

advanced weapons into the hands of what the columnist Charles Krauthammer 

has called "weapons states." While the exact terms of President George 

Bush's new world order have never been articulated, the major Western 

allies have understood the phrase to mean that the United States will lead 

the way in breaking out of the arms race that has dominated so much of 

international trade since the end of the Second World War.<P>

Yet already the focus of the struggle in the arms race is once again on 

the competition for sales and not on the fight to reduce the traffic. If 

much more time is allowed to pass, it will be clear that national-security 

policy in the Bush Administration is still being dictated by the 

traditional unholy trinity of defense

industry lobbyists, die-hards in the Pentagon, and State Department 

policy-makers who see arms as a tool of foreign policy.<P>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

The exact number of countries with a chemical-weapons capability is not 

known. What IS known is that the number of countries possessing such a 

capability or having ambitions to acquire one is growing. Twelve 

developing countries--Burma, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, 

Libya, North Korea, Syria, Taiwan, and Vietnam--are now believed to have 

chemical-weapons programs. Nineteen other countries--Afghanistan, Angola, 

Argentina, Chad, Chile, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, 

Laos, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, South 

Africa, South Korea, and Thailand--have been trying to obtain chemical 

weapons and may have succeeded. The developing countries have in general 

had to acquire their chemical-weapons capability on their own, usually 

illegally but frequently with the complicity of Western companies and 

governments who turn a blind eye because they have found a useful source 

of export earnings.<P>

In 1985 plans for a chemical-weapons plant at Rabta, in Libya, were drawn 

up by the West German firm Imhausen-Chemie, which was in financial 

difficulties at the time and needed the cash from the Libyan contract. 

Imhausen commissioned plans for the plant from the Salzgitter steel 

company, which is owned by the German government, telling Salzgitter that 

the work was for a pharmaceutical plant in Hong Kong. The Japan Steel 

Works did much of the construction at Rabta, employing Thai workers. By 

1988 the plant was producing nerve-gas casings, using steel supplied by 

other West German companies.<P>

British and American intelligence had been watching the project closely 

and by the summer of 1988 were convinced that once it was fully 

operational, the Libyans would be able to produce from 22,000 to 84,000 

pounds of nerve agents every day, making Rabta the largest 

chemical-weapons plant in the Third World. When confronted with the 

evidence, the Japanese government claimed that the Rabta complex was in 

fact a desalination plant--though it is fifty miles from the sea. No 

action of any kind was taken against the Japanese; and yet, earlier this 

year, the Bush Administration was prepared to impose sanctions against 

Japan in order to protect a rare turtle, whose shell the Japanese use to 

make ornaments.<P>

By the beginning of this year U.S. intelligence officials were saying that 

the Rabta complex was producing chemical weapons and that construction had 

begun on a massive underground storage facility nearby. Exactly who is 

building the underground facility is not known.<P>

To try and curb such blatant abuses, Australia took the initiative in 1985 

and invited representatives of a number of industrialized nations to a 

meeting at the Australian embassy in Paris the following June. The first 

meeting was attended by representatives of Australia, Canada, Japan, New 

Zealand, the United States, and the ten member nations of the European 

Community. The Australia Group, as it became known, meets every six months 

and has by now expanded to include Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, 

Austria, and representatives of the European Commission, the European 

Community's executive arm. Having drawn up a list of chemicals that are 

commonly used in the manufacture of chemical weapons, the group designated 

eleven of them to require export licenses from member states, and the 

export of a further thirty-nine will be controlled by all members by 

December. This watch list will give early warning of a country's intention 

to go into the chemical-weapons business.<P>

For the Australia Group's initiative to succeed, its members must 

effectively monitor the transfer of chemicals and prosecute violators. But 

there is no standard of enforcement to which every member is required to 

adhere, nor is there any way of penalizing either group members that 

ignore the agreement or other nations that simply export the raw 

materials.<P>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

In the middle of the military buildup in the Gulf last November, when 

President Bush had already decided to go to war the following January if 

necessary, the President vetoed a bipartisan congressional bill that would 

have imposed automatic sanctions on foreign companies that produce 

chemical weapons and on nations using such weapons. The Administration 

said that the bill was unsatisfactory because it did not allow the 

President to waive the terms in the interests of national security.<P>

After the veto the Administration announced its own measure, called the 

Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative, which greatly increased the 

number of chemicals that would be subject to export controls and included 

criminal penalties for American citizens who violated the regulations. 

However, many of the chemicals on the list are used in making a wide range 

of products, such as plastics, pharmaceuticals, and fertilizers. Business 

interests argued that the initiative unfairly penalized American companies 

and opened the door to foreign competitors who did not suffer similar 

restrictions. For example, one of the chemicals on the list can be used to 

remove hair from hides before tanning, but with some modifications it can 

also be used to make nerve gas. Lobbyists argued that by restricting the 

export of such dual-use chemicals, the United States was unfairly 

restricting American industry.<P>

Then, last February, the Senate passed new legislation, the Omnibus Export 

Amendments Act, which required the President to impose sanctions on 

countries and companies developing or using chemical weapons. It is 

similar to the measure vetoed by the President the previous November, but 

this time the President is not expected to use his veto if the House 

passes the legislation.<P>

Any new arms-control measures must have a common theme: behind the moral 

principles must lie tough sanctions that make transgressors responsible 

for their acts. Even if such sanctions are imposed, addressing the spread 

of conventional and chemical capabilities without dealing with other 

layers of proliferation is of little value.<P>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was signed in 1968 and came into 

force in 1970. The NPT was designed to keep the number of states with 

nuclear weapons stable at five--the United States, the Soviet Union, 

Britain, France, and China. The treaty calls for those who have nuclear 

weapons not to ship the equipment or transfer the technology necessary for 

other countries to develop nuclear weapons. To encourage support for the 

agreement, those countries that have signed the NPT have been helped to 

develop peaceful nuclear programs.<P>

One hundred forty-three countries have ratified the NPT, but some of the 

most important have not done so. Only recently France, China, and South 

Africa have indicated that they plan to abide by the terms of the NPT, 

while Israel, India, Pakistan, Brazil, and Argentina refuse to do so. But 

just who has or has not signed seems in fact to have made little 

difference in the spread of nuclear weapons. An early signatory of the 

NPT, Iraq pursued an aggressive twenty-year program to obtain nuclear 

weapons, with much Western help, notably from Germany. India developed a 

nuclear capability in the early 1970s and has actually tested a nuclear 

device. Pakistan, after more than fifteen years of trying to develop 

nuclear weapons, has either succeeded or is on the brink. According to 

unconfirmed reports, Pakistan has agreed to share nuclear technology with 

Libya, North Korea, Taiwan, and Brazil.<P>

In the face of such proliferation the Western nations have been unwilling 

to address the failure of the NPT. At the fourth five-year review 

conference of the NPT, in Geneva in August and September of last year, 

some progress was made. Suppliers of nuclear materials, such as Germany 

and Japan, agreed to sell them only to states observing internationally 

determined safeguards, and new measures were agreed on to improve the 

inspection capacity of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iraq, as a 

signatory to the NPT, had its nuclear plant regularly inspected by the 

IAEA. Not inspected, however, were the centrifuge plant for enriching 

uranium and the factories spread around the country where materials to be 

used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons were being designed and made.<P>

If countries have been able to ignore the institutions meant to govern the 

spread of chemical and nuclear weapons, they have often lacked the 

equipment to deliver the weapons to their target. This has brought about a 

whole new aspect of the arms race over the past ten years--the attempt by 

developing nations to acquire ballistic missiles. In testimony before 

Congress, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney has warned that by the end of 

this decade at least fifteen developing countries will be able to build 

and deploy ballistic missiles, and that eight of those fifteen either 

already have or will soon have a nuclear capability. Scud missiles are 

currently in service in Syria, Egypt, Iran, Libya, and Yemen, and Iraq 

still has a significant number of launchers and missiles.<P>

In April of 1987 the United States, Canada, France, Britain, Italy, Japan, 

and West Germany agreed to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), 

intended to curb exports of missiles able to deliver nuclear weapons and 

of equipment that might be used to develop such missiles. (Since 1987 

Spain, Australia, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands have agreed to 

participate.) The participants agreed not to export rocket systems, 

unmanned air-vehicle systems, or their components.<P>

A number of Western intelligence agencies agreed to share information on 

any countries that appeared to be trying to acquire ballistic-missile 

technology. Even countries not participating in the MTCR have provided 

useful intelligence, but such actions are on a voluntary basis and rely on 

the good will of the volunteers.<P>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

In the areas of nuclear and chemical weapons and ballistic missiles some 

international controls exist, even if not all of them work as they should. 

But there is a new, far more frightening generation of weapons on the 

way.<P>

Genetic engineering holds both hopeful and terrifying potential for 

humanity. It offers the real possibility of reducing famine, infant 

mortality, and poverty, but it also allows the production of weapons that 

could radically alter the nature of war.<P>

The purpose of warfare is to conquer the enemy, by destroying his ability 

to wage war or by actually taking territory or both. In the Gulf War there 

was considerable praise for the precision weapons employed by the allies, 

which hit their targets with pinpoint accuracy. Yet the allied coalition 

killed from 100,000 to 200,000 Iraqis, and not only destroyed the 

country's ability to wage war but also eliminated much of its industrial 

infrastructure. The war would have been less costly in money, lives, and 

economic potential if the allies had had a weapon that was REALLY 

precise.<P>

No commander WANTS to kill his enemy; he simply wants to make sure that 

his enemy does not kill him and that his own side wins. In the same way 

that the products of genetic engineering can control sickness or the 

performance of wheat, they can produce illness or destroy crops. Genetic 

engineering makes it possible to tailor toxins more precisely than ever 

before, and to generate them in nearly limitless quantities. For example, 

designer agents could be used in artillery shells intended to explode over 

an advancing force of infantry. Each load of agent could cause acute 

vomiting in the soldiers, making them unable to advance, or it could cause 

such instant and severe depression that none of them would be prepared to 

fight. Alternatively, a cruise missile could dispense an agent over a port 

or an industrial center to make all the civilians unconscious for 

twenty-four hours, disrupting reinforcements at the front and allowing an 

aggressor to capture vital territory virtually unopposed. For the past ten 

years Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have been studying 

the possibilities of designer agents as weapons of war.<P>

It is a tradition in the arms business that what the superpowers develop 

one year, other countries begin to look at the next. Developing nations 

have recognized that chemical weapons combined with ballistic missiles can 

be a cheap, powerful, and accessible alternative to nuclear weapons. 

Genetic engineering affords an even cheaper alternative.<P>

Before the Gulf War, Iraq had established the Al-Kindi Company for serum 

and vaccine production in Baghdad, had started a joint venture with Jordan 

and Saudi Arabia to establish the Arab company for Antibiotic Industries, 

had created a State Company for Drug Industries, and had announced that 

Iraqi biotechnologists were building a biological-research station in the 

southern marshes that would include a genetics-research laboratory.<P>

Currently no conventions, treaties, or other agreements effectively 

address the threat posed by genetically engineered weapons. In part this 

is because the science has emerged too recently for governments fully to 

understand the need for controls on the transfer of genetic technology. 

Also, difficulties encountered in trying to reduce the proliferation of 

chemical and nuclear weapons have discouraged the major powers from 

attempting to limit other weapons.<P>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

It seems clear from the failures of the past that new systems are needed 

for policing the arms business at every level. In instances where 

governments have relied on the morality of their own companies to obey the 

lava or on other countries to behave decently, they have been 

disappointed. The carrot has been tried--for example, access to peaceful 

nuclear technology in return for signing the NPT. But it has failed. For 

almost every arms-control agreement there are countries and companies that 

have ignored it, either for reasons of political expediency or because 

they needed the money.<P>

It is no longer enough to expect governments or companies to behave 

reasonably. What is needed is a new regime to deal with arms proliferation 

at all levels. Effective sanctions that make both countries and companies 

pay for breaching the terms of any agreement are required.<P>

As a first step, the United States should be able to persuade close allies 

such as the United Kingdom and Germany to restrict exports of all kinds of 

weapons to developing nations, and to prosecute companies that break the 

rules. The United Nations could be enlisted to keep a comprehensive 

register of arms transfers, so that any violations of agreements could be 

exposed.<P>

At a meeting of the seven leading industrialized nations, the so-called 

G7, in London last July, it was agreed that such a register should be set 

up. This was a useful step forward, but it appears that the register will 

be little different from the ones already kept by the Stockholm 

International Peace Research Institute and the International Institute for 

Strategic Studies in London. The G7 agreed that the rich nations will cut 

aid to those poorer nations deemed to be spending too much on arms. But 

this statement is virtually meaningless, since no definitions of rich and 

poor have been agreed on and no sanctions for persistent violators 

determined.<P>

In the Middle East it is already clear that the United States, the 

architect of the new UN policy, is confused about how it should be 

implemented. Last May, President Bush announced a new initiative that 

called for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction from the region, 

a freeze on the acquisition, production, and vesting of surface-to-surface 

missiles, and a policy of minimum deterrence that would restrict the 

amount of conventional weapons bought by any country. Less than 

twenty-four hours later Defense Secretary Chancy pledged additional 

military aid to Israel, including $200 million for a new anti-missile 

system. Perhaps such arms sales are necessary to encourage moves toward a 

wider Middle East peace. But if the peace does not come, this aid package 

will hardly have encouraged Arab nations--Syria, for example--to show 

restraint in the future.<P>

The growing competition in the arms market means that if the major powers 

step aside and agree to curbs on the weapons trade, other, less scrupulous 

countries will be eager to fill the orders. Indeed, the relative 

significance of the major powers as weapons suppliers is steadily being 

reduced in the face of this competition. For example, the U.S. share of 

the Middle East arms market, though lately on the upswing, fell in the 

late 1980s, with much of the difference being made up by suppliers in 

Europe, Latin America, South Africa, and China.<P>

Clearly the arms-control net needs to be widened. Arms producers among the 

developing nations, such as South Africa and Brazil, could be asked to 

join a voluntary agreement; if they refused to do so, and continued to 

sell arms without regard to the consequences, then sanctions could be 

applied. Such an ambitious policy has little prospect of surviving the 

elastic morality of day-to-day political decision-making. But it would be 

a useful start along what will undoubtedly be a long and difficult 

road.

	<font size=5>N</font>ATO is a subject that drives the dagger of boredom deep, deep into the 
heart. Perhaps in elite circles in Europe people pay attention to its 
workings; some few may even feel an improbable tingle of transnational 
patriotism over "the Alliance." But in the United States NATO is the 
exclusive property of academics who hold conferences at European resorts, 
or at the kind of American resort that should be in Europe, where they 
read turgid reports on why the United States must spend more tax dollars 
on an alliance to which not one American in ten has ever given a moment's 
thought. It is a rule of intellectual life in America: in any subject 
dominated by "study groups," such as NATO, the tacit goal is the diffusing 
of a fog of boredom, to repel boarders and thus to guarantee the total 
immunization from practical result so conducive to the professor's 
dream--endless, subsidized talk that begins in trivia and achieves a 
tentative culmination in the kind of "on the one hand, on the other" 
formulation that makes night fall across the mind.<p>

NATO has been made safe for the academics because the politicians have 
left it alone. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization began in 1949 in 
legendary bipartisanship, with the support of the Republican Arthur 
Vandenberg, of Michigan, who was the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee and had earlier been an isolationist, for the idea of 
America's joining a European military alliance. And with the exceptions of 
George McGovern's 1972 call for America to "come home" from its foreign 
military involvements and the former senator Mike Mansfield's failed 
attempts to recall troops from Europe, NATO has been pickled in 
bipartisanship ever since. For Democratic politicians in particular, 
obeisance to the Alliance has provided useful political cover. You could 
justify a vote against the B-l bomber, the MX missile, or the Strategic 
Defense Initiative by citing your offsetting vote for greater "readiness" 
for our troops on those "frontiers of freedom" so beloved of congressional 
orators. There are, after all, no pressure groups of articulate Americans 
lobbying for reductions in our subvention of NATO (as there are, in 
indignant abundance, against nuclear weapons), and in their absence the 
bipartisan consensus for the Alliance as it exists today is likely to 
endure. To count on a sudden access of vision or political courage from 
the Democratic Party on this issue is to bet against the evidence.<p>

What might bring a change--and thus make the form and degree of our 
participation in NATO a matter of politics, of popular debate and 
choice--is not statesmanship or courage but the instinct for survival. 
Long ago Franklin Roosevelt laid down the formula for Democratic victory: 
tax and tax, spend and spend, elect and elect. But with the level of 
taxation apparently beyond the pale of debate, the Democrats cannot make 
the kind of promises of new spending that might bring new constituencies 
to their party. To give themselves something meatier than competence to 
stand for, they must look to the existing universe of spending for the 
wherewithal to spend and elect.<p>

NATO should be a veritable El Dorado for them; or, indeed, for a 
Republican Party seeking a wider constituency through tax cuts. NATO costs 
United States taxpayers $150 billion to $170 billion a year. That comes to 
"significantly more than the defense contributions of the other 15 NATO 
members put together," according to a recent congressional report on 
"burden-sharing," which is NATO-speak for who pays what. In 1986 we spent 
$1,155 per capita on defense, while our "Alliance partners" spent an 
average of $318. Now, we do have responsibilities beyond the North 
Atlantic Treaty area, and our greater spending reflects that. Still, 60 
percent of our defense budget goes to defend Europe, which is to say that 
60 percent of $1,155 goes to Europe, which comes to $693 per citizen per 
year, or almost $1,600 per taxpayer per year.<p>

Those numbers ought to be available for indignation; $170 billion every 
year ought to make you grind your teeth. Who could possibly defend such an 
outrageous subsidy? The answer is that last refuge of journalists whose 
reach for generalization exceeds their analytical grasp--the establishment.<p>

Pat Schroeder can tell you all about the establishment. She made an 
exploratory run for the presidency in 1987 built around the theme of 
getting the allies to pay more of the cost of their own defense, and she 
got flayed, she says, as a "western woman" (she is a congresswoman from 
Colorado) threatening the foundations of the revered Alliance. "People 
think of The Washington Post and The New York Times as liberal," she told 
me recently, "and in our party people get into a fetal position and put 
their thumbs in their mouths if those papers say a nasty word about them. 
And if the Democrats said anything on burden-sharing, both of those papers 
would come down on them as flat-earthers, dinosaurs, isolationists. In our 
party people would rather be called perverts than isolationists."<p>

I asked her what the response to her call for burden-sharing was like 
beyond the Europhile ramparts of the establishment. "Outside Washington 
and outside The New York Times," she said, "people get it when you say 
that our MILITARY allies are also our trading partners, so if you're going 
to have a level playing field on the trade side, it's got to be more even 
on the military side, too. It can't be 'Dial 1-800-USA and we'll go 
anywhere.' 'Persian Gulf? We're on our way!' And then we get there and we 
start wimping around, asking, begging, 'Could you send a hospital ship 
that would make this look like an allied thing? Please?'"<p>

Schroeder is one of the leaders in Congress on "family policy," an 
emerging cluster of issues tailored to appeal to service-needy families, 
and when she looks at the annual $170 billion NATO payout she sees day 
care, and better public schools, and better health care for aging parents. 
She sees votes. But many of her colleagues have not yet gotten this 
message. "In Washington family policy is not a power issue," she told me. 
"There are no PACS around it. Toddlers don't pay honoraria. And not only 
that: you mention 'families' and people in Washington think you've got 
lace on your shorts. They're into poster projection--the MX, the D-5, the 
Midgetman. That's what's considered serious in Washington." Other 
countries, she pointed out, have other criteria of seriousness. "The 
standard of living is higher in other countries than it is here," she 
said. "We are paying a hundred and seventy billion to defend Europe, where 
college is free. Health care--free. Day care? No problem They put their 
taxes into those things, and we spend our taxes defending them."<p>




We can't go on like this. That, at any rate, is the unargued premise of 
this article. We can't go on like this not only because it's absurdly 
expensive but also because it's absurd in a darker sense as well--in 
extremis we might have to commit suicide to defend Europe. According to 
one poll, 81 percent of Americans believe that we would use nuclear 
weapons only as a response to a Soviet nuclear attack on the United 
States. They couldn't be more wrong, and their nescience is part of the 
wages of bipartisanship on NATO. "Flexible response," our main deterrent 
strategy in Europe, pledges us to use nuclear weapons, if necessary, 
against a Soviet conventional attack on Germany. "To contain Moscow," 
writes Christopher Layne, a heterodox foreign-policy analyst, "the United 
States, in a geopolitical sense, BECAME Germany." "Rational states," he 
says, "do not base their strategy on a pledge to commit suicide to protect 
other states' security." Henry Kissinger had this fateful quality in mind 
when, in a famous speech before the NATO Foreign Ministers, he said, 
"Don't you Europeans keep asking us to multiply assurances we cannot 
possibly mean and that if we do mean, we should not want to execute, and 
which if we execute, would destroy our civilization?"<p>

This article will explore paths out of the exorbitant anachronism of NATO. 
For while the political parties on this issue, as on so many others, have 
offered portraits in paralysis, thinkers both here and in Europe have 
given the reconstitution of the Alliance some refreshingly creative 
thought. In a signal development, moreover, their ideas on a new European 
security system have migrated to the Soviet Union, where General Secretary 
Mikhail Gorbachev, saddled with an exorbitant anachronism of his own (the 
Warsaw Pact), has given voice to them. Since the Soviets, under Gorbachev, 
set the American agenda, his interest in the new ideas has gotten the 
attention of the State Department. That institution, to be sure, has a way 
of escorting all fresh approaches to an early, unmarked grave. And 
certainly NATO's opening proposal in the new conventional-arms-reduction 
talks that began last March in Vienna contains not a breath of urgency. 
NATO wants the Warsaw Pact forces to be cut drastically, which is good, 
but wants its own forces cut only tokenly, which will knock perhaps a few 
million off our $170 billion tab. With Gorbachev calling the tune, 
however, you can't tell what will happen in Vienna. Count on winning the 
Irish sweepstakes sooner, but it just might dawn on this government that 
it is not doomed to wait for Gorbachev's every move, that statesmanship is 
not an exclusive Soviet prerogative in this era, and that George Bush's 
America can emulate Mikhail Gorbachev's Russia and let its foreign policy 
serve its domestic necessities.<p>


<b>AN AFTERSHOCK</b><p>

No U.S. taxpayer will be surprised to learn that NATO was a European idea. 
"The idea of a military alliance did not occur to the original containment 
people--Marshall, Kennan, and the others," John Lewis Gaddis, a leading 
diplomatic historian of the post-war era, told me not long ago. "They 
started out thinking that economic aid would be sufficient to do what they 
wanted to do--restore the balance of power in Europe in the wake of World 
War Two. It was the Europeans who asked for an explicit military 
alliance," Gaddis said. "But there was no idea in the original concept 
that we could commit troops to Europe. We would furnish a security 
guarantee only, not station troops there. The decision to commit troops 
came later. It was one of the aftershocks of the Korean War." The North 
Korean attack on South Korea in June of 1950 was widely considered at the 
time to be a "feint" to cover a major Soviet move on Western Europe.<p>

I asked Gaddis if there was any evidence that the Soviets had then or ever 
planned such an attack. "An ambiguous piece of evidence comes out of the 
memoirs of a Czech Party official," he told me, "who describes Stalin in 
195l as having ordered planning for the invasion of Europe. But that 
doesn't mean much, since states routinely draw up worst-case contingency 
plans to invade potential enemies." Gaddis went on, "Moreover, Stalin was 
much less of a risk-taker than Khrushchev. This view of Stalin, of course, 
obliges you to account for the Korean anomaly, but there is plausible 
evidence, even there, that North Korea invaded South Korea on its own, 
without Soviet instigation." Although Stalin's attack on Europe never 
came, the aftershock lingers on.<p>

Today it takes the shape of the four-plus U.S. Army divisions in Germany. 
They are a formidable force, heavily armored, highly motivated, and backed 
by a multibillion-dollar logistical supply train designed to keep them in 
the field longer than their Soviet counterparts. Still, their deployment 
has always been as much for psychological as for military purposes. They 
are a reassurance to the Europeans, who fear that unless our boys are 
being killed on the frontiers of freedom, we will think twice about 
inviting our destruction by making good our promise to save the few acres 
of the Alliance that Providence will have saved from pulverization. Under 
the Gorbachev persuasion, however, the Europeans seem to need less and 
less reassurance. A recent poll showed, for example, that only four 
percent of the British public now sees the Soviet Union as a serious 
threat to British security. Another poll showed that 80 percent of West 
Germans now believe that there is no longer a military threat from the 
East, while 50 percent have negative attitudes about aspects of the U.S. 
presence in their country.<p>

That presence is undoubtedly inconvenient. Just under 790,000 soldiers, 
including 245,000 American GIs, are based in West Germany, which is the 
size of Oregon. That works out to more than eight soldiers per square 
mile, as opposed to 0.4 soldiers per square mile in the United States. 
Just in reparations payments for damages to property, the training 
maneuvers of this enormous force cost the allied governments nearly $70 
million annually. In the skies above West Germany, NATO aircraft make 
80,000 low-altitude training flights every year, which create intolerable 
levels of noise, and also danger--last year seventy-five civilians were 
killed in West Germany by military air crashes. A poll conducted in 
December found that 71 percent of West Germans favored a total ban on 
these flights, even though the Bonn government had come out for a partial 
ban and even though the allied fliers say they need the drills to learn 
the terrain of the country they are sworn to defend.<p>

The 790,000 NATO soldiers face 995,000 Warsaw Pact soldiers across the 
800-kilometer Central Front. In the whole Atlantic-to-Urals theater, which 
is the "reduction area" that the current Vienna talks will cover, there 
are six million soldiers and airmen armed with 10,000 nuclear weapons, 
making for a combined cost, to East and West, of $600 billion a year. It 
is, writes Jonathan Dean a U.S. ambassador to the last conventional-arms 
talks, "the largest, the deadliest, and the most costly peacetime military 
confrontation in history."<p>

As the disparity in numbers along the Central Front indicates, NATO is 
behind the Pact in manpower and in tanks (12,800 to 18,800), tactical 
aircraft (1,200 to 2,350), and artillery pieces (3,100 to 11,100). The 
numbers make it seem that NATO is cooked if the Pact strikes. NATO, 
though, adheres to what the strategic analyst Barry Posen calls a 
different "theory of victory" from that of the Pact, which holds that 
victory goes to the side with more "teeth"--more men with guns. NATO 
thinks victory goes to the side with more "tail"--a thicker logistical 
umbilical cord for pumping in fresh men and supplies as soon as they are 
needed. Is NATO right? In the wake of the INF treaty, which will eliminate 
U.S. intermediate-range nuclear weapons from Europe, that question has 
taken on a new edge. In the burgeoning field of security studies, it has 
touched off a sophisticated, vituperative, and arcane debate, featuring 
such exotica as "Lanchester attrition models," "armored division 
equivalent scores," and algebraic models of what might happen if the 
armies actually clash on the German plain. It is not my purpose to descend 
into this fray. Rather, I want to emphasize the points of agreement 
between the two sides in the debate as a way of establishing the nature of 
the military challenge with which NATO must be prepared to cope.<p>




Those who think that NATO's conventional forces are strong and those who 
think they are weak relative to the Pact's agree about what it is those 
forces must deter or defeat: a blitzkrieg attack by the Pact tank armies. 
The Soviets cannot go around the NATO line; mountains on one end and the 
Baltic Sea on the other prevent that. So they must break through it, get 
into the rear of the NATO forces, smash their communications, sow panic, 
and in general do to NATO What the Germans did to the British and French 
forces defending France in 1940--cut them off from one another, the better 
to destroy them piecemeal. In a blitzkrieg, John Mearsheimer writes in his 
seminal book Conventional Deterrence, "the offense literally outruns the 
defense. The attack succeeds because the defense is incapable of 
containing what Liddell Hart aptly called 'the expanding torrent.'"<p>

To dam that torrent at its first gush, a strong defensive line is needed. 
In France in 1940 the Allied forces employed a static defense; they fought 
from fixed positions and had little ability to move up or down the front 
to stanch the flood. NATO has highly mobile armored divisions to effect 
what it calls a strategy of forward defense--"a linear arrangement of 
forward-deployed forces that have significant tactical mobility," to quote 
Mearsheimer.<p>

Mobility alone, however, is no guarantee that NATO can avoid the fate of 
the Allies in 1940. Thickness (sheer mass both overall and at the point or 
points of the attack) is equally important. To deter a blitzkrieg, and to 
repel one should deterrence fail, NATO must keep the "forward edge of 
battle area," or FEBA, thickly populated. "There is an optimum number of 
troops required to hold a specific length of territory, an optimum 
FORCE-TO-SPACE ratio." Mearsheimer writes, employing a concept of military 
science that makes both sides in the debate over NATO's post-INF strength 
uneasy about the withdrawal of at least some U.S. troops from the FEBA to 
which the Vienna talks are likely to lead.<p>

For years NATO has decried The Pact's superiority in numbers of men and 
weapons. Now, on the eve of historic negotiations with a Soviet leader who 
has already made impressive unilateral cuts, NATO may be to some extent 
hostage to its own past propaganda about numbers, which have, after all, 
never figured in its theory of victory. In many politically attractive 
reduction schemes NATO could come out ahead of the Pact in numbers but be 
weaker, if it has thinned out its forces to a density below that dictated 
by the force-to-space ratios necessary to make its forward-defense 
strategy work. The algebra of force to space is implacable: To hold so 
many square miles, it takes a force so big. A thin FEBA is an invitation 
to blitzkrieg.<p>

But must the FEBA be thinned, one might ask? Can't German boys take the 
place of American boys withdrawn from the line? Demography joins geography 
to say no. Starting early in the 1990s there will not be enough German 
boys of draft age to man the current German army, much less to fill space 
left by departing GIs. The Germans will have to hire Turks to people the 
line.<p>

Ideally, French boys would be available for the job, and there has, in 
fact, been talk in the diplomatic press that France might want to return 
to NATO (De Gaulle pulled the country out of NATO's military structure in 
the sixties) if we leave a leadership vacuum to be filled. The French have 
trained a brigade with the West German army, and there are other straws in 
the wind. As Western Europe's largest country, France should be in NATO, 
but it won't come in unless we start to get out; pride would not permit 
France to play second fiddle to us. They don't like to face it in 
Washington, but we are not irreplaceable. A canny Yankee statesmanship 
would manipulate the bottomless vanity of the French to get them to take 
our place in the Alliance in much the same way that Tom Sawyer got the 
idlers to paint Aunt Polly's fence. Before we were powerful, we were 
shrewd.<p>

Meanwhile, the Soviets have their own force-to-space anxieties. They have 
to ask themselves how far they can cut their forces in Eastern Europe and 
still retain their ability to coerce, overawe, and intimidate the restive 
peoples of what were once unblushingly referred to as "the captive 
nations."<p>

These parallel fears about numbers--the one military, the other 
political--are the key limiting factor in the Vienna talks. They will 
impede the negotiations and bracket their progress unless a new formula 
for Central European security can be found.<p>


<B>QUALITATIVE DISARMAMENT</B><p>

Herbert Hoover has gone down in history as a the embodiment of heartless, 
unimaginative conservatism, a President who did nothing, as FDR did much, 
to lift the misery of the Depression. Hoover deserves a better press. He 
may soon come into his own
in a different guise--as the godfather of a new peace in Europe.<p>

In June of 1932, at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, President Hoover 
proposed a plan for comprehensive disarmament aimed at "increasing the 
comparative power of the defense through decreases in the power of 
attack." Specifically, Hoover, who happened to be a Quaker, called for 
"the abolition of all tanks, all chemical warfare, and all large mobile 
guns; the abolition of all bombing planes, the total prohibition of all 
bombardment from the air; and reduction by one third of battleships and 
submarines, and by one quarter of aircraft carriers, cruisers, and 
destroyers."<p>

The Hoover Plan might have ended war as we know it; instead, the plan died 
aborning, principally because Hitler removed Germany from the Geneva 
Conference in October of 1933 and shortly afterward from the League of 
Nations. Still, in the interval between Hoover's pronouncement and 
Hitler's coup de grace, the Hoover Plan dangled a plausible dream of peace 
before a world rushing toward war.<p>

After defeating Hoover in the November election, President Roosevelt 
seconded his vision for peace in a statement to the Geneva Conference that 
laid down the formula for what has come to be known as qualitative 
disarmament--"qualitative" because it seeks to reduce the kinds, rather 
than the sheer numbers, of weapons: "If all nations will agree wholly to 
eliminate from possession and use weapons which make possible a successful 
attack, defenses will automatically become impregnable, and the frontiers 
and independence of every nation will become secure."<p>

The idea behind qualitative disarmament is appealingly simple. If what 
Liddell Hart called "the defense-breaking weapons"--tanks, mobile 
artillery, attack aircraft, poison gas--are taken away or drastically 
limited in number, the blitzkrieg is not a tenable strategy. You can't, 
after all, burst into an opponent's rear unless you first pierce his 
forward line, and you can't pierce his forward line without those 
defense-breaking weapons. The blitzkrieg is a strategy for a quick 
victory, a short war. Rule it out, by ruling out the weapons that make it 
possible, and you are left with the prospect of a repeat of 1914-1918, a 
long war of attrition. Conventional deterrence in the modern world rests 
on the hope that the surest way of keeping the peace is making your 
opponent face the certainty of a war of attrition. It is perhaps 
supererogatory to add that the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who engaged in 
a war of attrition with Iraq for eight years, does not belong to the 
modern world.<p>




To find out more about qualitative disarmament, I spoke recently with Mark 
Sommer, the research director of the Alternative Defense Project, in New 
York City one of a number of groups dedicated, in their different ways, to 
former President Ronald Reagan's goal: peace through strength.<p>

"Qualitative disarmament," Sommer told me, "reasserts a distinction that 
has been lost for years between the capacity to attack and the capacity to 
protect. Nuclear deterrence has dominated our thinking about defense in 
general. In that theory, it's true, it is only through the capacity to 
attack, or to threaten attack, that you have the capacity to protect. But 
it's possible to think of conventional deterrence in a less punitive way."<p>

"Look at the standoff in Europe," he said. "Each alliance says it's 
configured only for defense, yet both armies are prepared to take the 
battle over into the other's territory. They don't understand that they 
could relinquish that capacity to attack without weakening their capacity 
to protect." NATO would both feel and be more secure if the Pact forces 
along the inter-German border did not have "defense-breaking" weapons. The 
Pact would feel and be more secure if the United States did not have the 
offensive weapons to execute its two broad doctrines: the Air-Land Battle, 
which calls for ground and tactical air forces to engage the enemy not 
only at the front but also in his own territory, and the Follow-on-Forces 
Attack, in which highly accurate smart weapons would cut the tail of a 
tract offensive with deep strikes at its rear. An arms-reduction scheme 
that could pluck the defense-breaking weapons from the arsenals of both 
sides, Sommer said, would allure both sides to defend the same territory 
at much less risk of escalation in a crisis and at much less cost.<p>

How do you tell the difference between offensive and defensive weapons, so 
that you can pluck out one and leave the other? I put that question to 
Paul Walker, a weapons analyst, the author of several books on defense, 
and the co-director of the Institute for Peace and International Security, 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Offensive weapons, Walker said, have a long 
range, their payloads are heavy, and they are highly mobile. Defensive 
weapons have shorter ranges, they are less accurate and they are less 
mobile across, but not up and down, a given front. Walker conceded that in 
practice these fine distinctions might be hard to make. "Frankly," he 
said, "The best was of telling offensive from defensive weapons is to ask 
the other side what weapons of YOURS they perceive as offensive."<p>

The notion of asking the other side what weapons scare it, so that you can 
get rid of them, would no doubt get a hoot in the local pub. The whole 
idea is to scare the other guy, right? Wrong. Scaring the other guy leads 
to arms-race instability: you build, he builds, you build some more, and 
pretty soon that $170 billion we spend on NATO rises to $225 billion, and 
beyond. That way lies penury. And yet it's the direction in which the Bush 
Administration appears to be heading.<p>

In the presidential campaign Bush talked about implementing something 
called "competitive strategies" to strengthen NATO, which apparently means 
rapidly developing and deploying a new generation of deep-strike weapons 
aimed at preventing the Pact from reinforcing its initial attack. These 
weapons, which would simply implement the Follow-on-Forces Attack 
doctrine, are deeply offensive in character, even though our expressed 
intention is to use them only in counterattack. Competitive strategies--so 
named because they would use our "competitive" advantage, high technology 
to counter the Pact's big numbers--look like an attempt to secure a 
unilateral advantage over the Soviets a la Strategic Defense Initiative. 
Used as a bargaining chip in the Vienna talks, the threat of these 
high-tech weapons might wrest from the Soviets the kind of asymmetrical 
reductions in conventional forces that they agreed to in nuclear forces in 
the INF treaty (four to one). But if the Bush Administration has any idea 
of using the new weapons to compensate for a decrease in U.S. ground 
forces, it should think again.<p>

A prime objective of U.S. policy in the Vienna talks should be to mute the 
threat of the "standing-start" attack--a surprise attack launched by the 
twenty Soviet divisions in East Germany against the NATO line. The 
standing-start attack has long been NATO's chief anxiety and the Soviets 
would be fools to declaw it if we had plans to field weapons that would 
give us a surprise-attack capability of our own.<p>

In his statement at the May, 1988, summit with President Reagan, Gorbachev 
put forward a four-step program for cutting the forces in Europe which 
offers a better way, the way of Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt. The key 
step is "eliminating the offensive core" of each alliance's 
forces--qualitative disarmament. Which raises a practical question: How 
would armies stripped of their offensive cores defend themselves and their 
territories?<p>


<B>NON-OFFENSIVE DEFENSE</B><p>

In late 1987 four western proponents of the ideas and strategies that are 
grouped under the rubric of "non-offensive defense" wrote Gorbachev a 
letter outlining their views. He wrote back with a general endorsement of 
their thinking, and urged them to develop it further. It was, says 
Jonathan Dean, the former conventional arms negotiator, in his important 
forthcoming study of the prospects for a conventional-arms treaty in 
Europe, "a remarkable example" of East-West communication. "Western 
advocates of non-offensive defense," he says, "attracted the attention of 
the Soviet defense intellectuals and academicians, who sold General 
Secretary Gorbachev on the merits of these ideas."<p>

If parity in men and weapons has been the main goal of NATO in its past 
and now in its current talks with the Pact, superiority is the goal of 
non-offensive defense; superiority, however, not of one side over the 
other but of the defense over the offense. You have only to consider what 
Roger Ailes or Lee Atwater could do with the notion of superiority as 
against parity to grasp its latent political uses.<p>

The doyen of non-offensive defense is a West German defense intellectual 
with a name from Central Casting: Horst Alfheldt. In 1976 Alfheldt wrote a 
book outlining a wholly new strategy for NATO. In place of armored 
divisions, he wanted NATO to rely on "Tekhno-Kommandoes," groups of from 
twenty to thirty men armed with hand-held precision-guided missiles. At 
the threat of war 10,000 Tekhno-Kommandoes would spread out both across 
the front and deep behind it, taking up positions at hardened sites fitted 
out with enough supplies and ammunition to sustain them throughout the 
battle. Because the groups would be small, they would offer the Pact no 
concentrated target for conventional or nuclear artillery or air strikes. 
Because they would be equipped with next-generation high-tech weapons, 
they would wreak havoc on the turrets and treads of the Pact's tanks. The 
Tekhno-Kommandoes, in addition, would be backed by a thick network of 
rocket artillery, made up of rocket launchers cunningly camouflaged in the 
terrain. Each launcher, ideally, would be used only once, so that it could 
not draw counterbattery fire from Pact gunners, who would, in effect, have 
nothing to shoot at but the screeching air. Suppose the Pact attacked on a 
fifty-kilometer front (roughly the width of the key gaps in the 
inter-German border which the allies are most concerned about covering) 
that was defended by five rockets per square kilometer, each with a range 
of forty kilometers. "As it crossed the frontier," Alfheldt wrote, "every 
attacking unit would be in the range of fire of all the network's rockets 
inside a semicircle with a 40 km radius. Thus 12,500 missiles would be 
ready to attack the intruding unit." If the intrepid attacker nevertheless 
penetrated 100 kilometers deep behind that fifty-kilometer front, up to 
100,000 rockets could fall on him, utterly spoiling his day. The 
Tekhno-Kommandoes may have a Buck Rogers-meets-Danny the Red flavor, but 
this is clearly not a scheme hatched by sandal-wearing pacifists who 
wouldn't know the business end of a revolver from a cord of wood.<p>

Some versions of non-offensive defense completely eliminate tanks. Others 
use tanks to put lethal sting into a "spider-web defense." As envisioned 
by its theoreticians, the web would consist of 450 dispersed infantry 
battalions manned by 300,000 West Germans (which is about the troop 
strength of the current West German army). These troops would be supported 
by a rear-echelon mobile force, half West German and half NATO, of 
200,000--the spider.<p>

The spider-web battlefield would be framed by a belt of mines and sensors 
adjacent to the border. Immediately behind this would begin a checkerboard 
of prepared strong points whose defenders would aim multidirectional fire 
at the attackers, throw up barriers, and lay down minefields to channel 
the attack. The spider would descend into the web to disrupt the attack 
and to relieve besieged strong points. Against the thick web the expanding 
torrent of the blitzkrieg would find no outlet; it could not outrun what 
would amount to a defense in depth. Caught in the web, Pact forces would 
be prey for the spider. But most important, "as the spider would not be 
able to operate outside the web, which would be confined to West German 
territory," a theoretician of the strategy writes, "the concept is 
unambiguously defensive."<p>

Horst Alfheldt's original vision was to make non-offensive defense a 
unilateral policy: something that either NATO or West Germany could do on 
its own, to strengthen its defenses without threatening either arms race 
or crisis instability with the Pact. A stronger conventional defense, 
Alfheldt reasoned, could allow NATO to dispense with its first-use 
flexible-response strategy and perhaps with nuclear weapons altogether. 
That, in turn, might mean that Germany would not be turned into rubble if 
deterrence failed. This vision of a Germany able to defend itself without 
becoming a charnel house in the bargain is one reason why non-offensive 
defense has been taken up by the leading German opposition party and why 
even the Kohl government's coalition partners, the Free Democrats, have 
said some good things about it. Until Gorbachev, it appeared that the 
unilateral emphasis would put the curse on non-offensive defense. But 
Gorbachev's interest in qualitative disarmament, and his provocative hints 
about reconfiguring the Pact forces, have made it conceivable that there 
could be negotiations for the adoption of the new strategy by both sides.<p>

With or without the mobile spider force, non-offensive defense would 
create a thickly populated FEBA; the defense in depth, according to 
military thinkers, is an excellent strategy to discourage or repel a 
blitzkrieg. The same cannot be said, however, for a strategy of forward 
defense with an inadequate number of men and weapons to execute it. If 
NATO stays with its current strategy, in other words, it cannot afford to 
make the kinds of reductions in forces that would save real money. 
Non-offensive defense would cost money too, but most of it would have the 
virtue of being German.<p>

Non-offensive defense has one major military advantage over the current 
alternative. Critics of forward defense point convincingly to its 
potentially catastrophic weakness: everything depends on timely 
mobilization. Even those analysts, like Mearsheimer, who are optimistic 
about NATO's ability to fight the Pact to a standstill concede that unless 
the NATO governments call up their reserves at the first hint of a Pact 
mobilization, the Pact will win. But in a moment of tension to rank with 
the Cuban missile crisis, would the NATO governments dare to stir the 
wrath of their opposition parties and peace movements by calling for 
prompt mobilization? Fearing that mobilization would be provocative to the 
Pact, which could use it as an excuse to torque a crisis into war, they 
might well dither, while thousands upon thousands of Soviet soldiers 
streamed out of Russia and toward the line. The NATO governments are 
justified in these fears over mobilization, as the Soviet government is in 
its fears, because the heavily armored NATO forces have the capability to 
take the offensive--to smash into Eastern Europe and accomplish its 
"liberation." But a call to the Tekhno-Kommandoes or the web forces to 
take up their strictly defensive positions would carry no offensive 
threat, and consequently would be easier to make. On the central issue of 
mobilization, therefore, non-offensive defense has a clear edge over 
current NATO strategy.<p>


<B>IMMOBILISM</B><p>

Non-offensive defense has come under fire from many quarters. Although it 
is a formula for defensive superiority, it did emerge from what could 
broadly be called the European peace movement, which provenance is the 
kiss of death in hard-boiled Washington. Military men, understandably, 
don't like the idea of sacrificing their big-ticket offensive weapons. The 
arms makers could hardly be enthusiastic about that prospect either, 
though the high-tech aura of the Tekhno-Kommandoes might give them an 
opening. The bureaucrats in the State Department and the Pentagon and the 
National Security Council, and their friends in the press and among the 
opinion makers, would of course resist any effort to reduce American 
hegemony anywhere--especially in Europe, which is such a grand place to 
visit for the odd conference, seminar, or military review.<p>

Can a set of ideas that threatens such powerful constituencies succeed? 
Probably not. We may get some qualitative disarmament from the Soviets, 
but the force-to-space arguments of the military will limit how far we can 
go and how much money we can save. A clear party difference on the issue 
could alter this dour prognosis. But the Democrats are already snakebitten 
by the charge of being "soft on defense." Fancy them mustering the nerve 
to adopt an idea fathered by "Euroweenies" which would force NATO to scrap 
most of its arsenal! Lee Atwater would have their tails.<p>

The last conventional-arms-reduction talks went on in Vienna for fifteen 
years, and they were a total failure. Paul Walker, the arms analyst, told 
me a story that illustrates one reason why. Recently he and some 
colleagues of his interviewed a number of people prominent in security 
policy to see if they were open to the ideas of qualitative disarmament 
and non-offensive defense "Most of them agreed that the Mutual Balanced 
Force Reduction Talks had been a disaster," he told me. "But a minority of 
the career bureaucrats we spoke to said they thought the talks were highly 
successful. Puzzled, I asked one of them why he held this curious view. A 
cynical smile played over his face as he answered, 'Because we didn't pull 
the troops out. The talks allowed us to stage a show in Vienna while 
keeping the troops in Europe.'<p>

"'Well, now,' I asked him," Walker said, "'What are your hopes for the new 
arms-reduction talks?' He smiled that cynical smile again and said, 'We 
think they'll be equally successful.'"<p>

That kind of immobilism is possible only when bureaucrats operate in a 
politics-free environment. Alas, the Alliance is apt to remain that for 
the foreseeable future. We need a Huey Long to popularize the issue of 
America's saving money through greater European autonomy in defense, but 
few Democrats--with the notable exception of Sam Nunn, who has proposed a 
50 percent reduction in the forces of both alliances--have the "strength" 
credentials to do so.<p>

The absence of any discernible public pressure, the probability of 
opposition from the professional military, the likelihood that even 
serious arms-reductions negotiations would bog down in distinguishing 
offensive from defensive weapons, an apparent split in the Soviet ranks 
between the military and the civilian defense intellectuals over the 
merits and meaning of defensive strategies, and the certainty of more 
unilateral moves by Gorbachev on a par with last December's 500,000-man 
cut in his forces--these portents of sterility and diplomatic defeat have 
led some observers to contemplate formulas more radical than 
arms-reductions talks for extricating America from the exorbitant 
anachronism.<p>


<B>MUTUAL DISENGAGEMENT</B><p>

Christopher Layne calls himself a Taft Republican, and one's inclination 
is to take him at his word. Layne was an adviser to the Bush campaign, but 
perhaps because he holds unusual views, he was not invited to join the new 
administration. He has a Ph.D. from Berkeley in international relations 
and writes frequently for prestigious publications in that field, but he 
makes his living as a lawyer in Los Angeles.<p>

In a series of articles that combine strategic acumen with political 
savvy, Layne has staked out a position on NATO of which Senator Robert 
Taft, who in the late forties fought our entry into a European military 
alliance, would be proud. What Layne wants is nothing less than the 
disenagement of both superpowers from Europe.<p>

"I want to get the Soviet army out of Europe and back to the Soviet Union, 
where it belongs," he told me when we spoke not long ago. "In order to do 
that, we will have to take our forces out of Germany and bring them back 
to the United States, where they belong."<p>

Why, I asked, is it so important to get the Soviet army out of Europe? His 
answer surprised me. "Because the risk of war breaking out is too great if 
it remains there," he said. I asked him to explain.<p>

"Wars are not caused by nations' having armies," he said. "Wars are caused 
by political conflicts that create crises that spin out of control. Now, 
the Soviets are not going to wake up one morning and say, 'Let's invade 
Europe today.' That's just not going to happen. But their being in Eastern 
Europe prevents the natural political evolution of the Eastern European 
countries. Thus political tensions within those countries fester--they 
have no safety valve. Sooner or later, under these conditions, an 
explosion will happen; popular unrest will break out. What will the 
Soviets do then? Will they sit back and watch their empire disintegrate, 
or will they be tempted to launch a war against the West to save the 
empire?"<p>

How would a war against the West help them do that? I asked. Layne invoked 
a parallel to the Austro-Hungarian empire in answer. Fearful that the 
example of an independent Serbia would provoke separatist movements among 
the multifarious peoples of its empire, Austro-Hungary launched a 
preemptive attack against Serbia that triggered the engulfing catastrophe 
of the First World War. In the "war for the empire" scenario, think of 
Western Europe as Serbia and Russia as Austro-Hungary. Think further of 
what Layne calls "the immense magnetic attraction" that Western Europe 
exerts over Eastern Europe. Now consider how this magnetic attraction 
looks to the Soviets. They are properly afraid, Layne says, that pluralism 
and nationalism will continue to quicken not only within Eastern Europe 
but among the peoples of "the inner empire"--the Balts, the Ukrainians, 
and others. Separatism in Poland might spread separatism in the Ukraine. 
In thinking through how to deal with it, the Soviets might conclude that 
they had three choices, none of them good: do nothing and watch their 
empire disintegrate, strike at the offending provinces in the certain 
knowledge that they would have to do it again in a generation, or strike 
at the magnetic attraction doing the disintegrating. From panic springs 
folly. Perestroika and glasnost, in combination with the magnetic 
attraction, might spark events in Eastern Europe whose consequences cannot 
be foretold. Should a crisis within the Soviet empire erupt, Layne wants 
the Soviet army off the borders of the West, where it sits today.<p>

"Disengagement makes it much more unlikely that war will break out in that 
scenario," Layne said. "For one thing, the Soviets would almost certainly 
have to fight their way through Eastern Europe to get at the West, and 
they know it. But it's also important to point out that disengagement is 
not just a military process; it's a way of finding a political outcome for 
the Soviets' problem in Eastern Europe. Which is, how do you keep those 
countries more or less aligned with the Soviet Union in their external 
policy, while giving them the autonomy to make the internal political and 
economic reforms that are necessary to forestall unrest?"<p>

Layne, in short, wants a Finlandized Eastern Europe, and he thinks that 
George Bush should want it too, should see that mutual disengagement is 
the only way to get it, and should act boldly to bring it about. 
Specifically, he wants Bush to seize the diplomatic initiative from 
Gorbachev by proposing that both superpowers remove their nuclear and 
Conventional forces from Europe, "demobilize" them--return them to 
civilian life--asymmetrically, to account for the geographical 
asymmetries, and pledge that neither will be the first to put them back.<p>

He would retain a "residual nuclear deterrence" for Europe by means of 
submarines based off the European coasts--thus ending the suicide pact and 
restoring our "nuclear sovereignty." Otherwise, he would let Europe be 
Europe.<p>

Does Europe want to be Europe? Layne cites current West German-American 
differences over the Lance missile (we want to keep this short-range 
nuclear weapon; the Germans, knowing that "the shorter the range, the 
deader the Germans," are balking) as an omen of a "messy divorce" to come. 
The Lance missile, the possibility of a trade war with the single economic 
unit that Europe will become in 1992, the threat that the wily Gorbachev 
will sow dissension within the Alliance by offering to take down the 
Berlin Wall in exchange for the "denuclearization" of Europe, the bad 
political weather left by Ronald Reagan's call, in Reykjavik, for 
eliminating the ballistic missiles upon which the security of Europe is 
supposed to depend--these are some of the storms that lie just over the 
horizon for the Alliance. Better to get out now, Layne says, when we can 
by that act pry the Soviets out too. Suppose they refuse to go and we both 
end up staying there. In that case we will at least have wrested the high 
diplomatic ground from them. "The trick of statesmanship," Layne says, "is 
to turn the inevitable to one's own advantage."<p>

Layne is untroubled by the prospect of a reunited Germany, which, given 
the prevailing political dynamics, might well be a result of mutual 
disengagement. With an insouciance that takes one's breath away, he has 
written, "The prevailing (and historically incorrect) view is that Germany 
caused TWO world wars in this century." One hopes his prospective vision 
here is better than his retrospective.<p>

For a reunited Germany is the stuff of nightmares. You can't dig into NATO 
as a subject without hearing, in an aside here, a mumbled comment there, 
that to British and French and even some American observers, the Alliance 
has the purpose not just of containing Soviet power but also of separating 
Germany from its past. The superpower forces in Germany, seen from this 
perspective, are an occupation force, a multibillion-dollar lid on the 
restless grave of the Third Reich.<p>

Layne is afraid that Gorbachev will disrupt the Alliance by playing the 
card of German reunification, but memory may stay his hand. No nation 
suffered more from the last German drive to achieve hegemony in Europe 
than the Soviet Union; the Nazis slaughtered millions of Russians. The 
Soviet Union's searing experience of 1941-1945 would seem to put the 
German card, if it has anything more than a notional existence, squarely 
in the hands of the West. Should the West play it? Should it, through 
mutual disengagement, set in train developments that could lead to its 
being played? Twice in twenty years Germany upset the balance of power in 
Europe, bringing death to 60 million people. In the past forty years 
Europe, under superpower occupation, has known peace. History does not 
exhaust possibility. Nevertheless, history says, "Don't play that card," 
or it says nothing. Risk must be set against risk in international 
affairs, however, cost against cost, history against hope.<p>




"Reducing a huge military confrontation," Jonathan Dean writes, "is a 
ticklish and sensitive task, something like defusing a giant bomb." The 
analogy is exact: a bomb is dangerous to defuse and to ignore. Those who 
say that we cannot afford to defuse this one must meet an argument from 
history: we had 50,000 fewer men in Europe in the late sixties than we 
have now, and the Soviets did not invade Western Europe; nor would 50,000 
more GIs back of the line have kept them from invading Czechoslovakia. No, 
the chief danger of war is the one that Christopher Layne has adduced: a 
desperate war to preserve a collapsing empire. It's a troubling irony, but 
the ferment of reform in the Soviet Union makes that kind of war seem 
more, not less, conceivable. That is one powerful reason to seize this 
chance to build down the armies in Europe, if possible to reconfigure them 
from offense to defense, if possible to withdraw them completely. A second 
powerful reason starts with us, with our needs at the dawn of a new age of 
international economic competition. We have borne too much of the burden 
of Europe for too long. It's time to put America first.<p>

<blockquote>
	<i><font size=4>The health care crisis is upon us. In response to soaring costs, a jumbled 
patchwork of insurance programs, and critical problems in delivering 
medical care, some kind of national health insurance has seemed in recent 
years to be an idea whose time has finally come in America. For those not 
protected by insurance--and often for those who are partially 
protected--illness means financial disaster. The quality of American 
medical care is at issue too. After twenty years of unprecedentedly high 
spending for research our public health standards have fallen far behind 
some countries with fewer resources. We rank seventeenth in infant 
mortality, according to a United Nations study; thirtieth in life 
expectancy for males, behind Spain, Greece, and five Communist nations in 
Eastern Europe. And yet, writes reporter Godfrey Hodgson, for all our 
troubles, an opportunity to reform American health care has slipped by. 
How could this be? And where do we go from here?</i></font><p>
	
	
	<pre>
	
	</pre>
	
	<font size=5>I</font>f someone had asked me five years ago," said Dr. Rashi Fein, "to estimate 
when the United States would have some clearly universal and comprehensive 
system of national health insurance, I might have answered: in fifteen 
years."<P>
"Three years ago," he went on, "my estimate would have been fifteen minus 
eight, or minus ten, or even minus twelve. But if someone were to ask me 
today when we will have national health insurance, my answer would be: 
many years more."<P>
Dr. Fein, of the Harvard Medical School, is one of the most highly 
respected authorities on health policy in the country; the fact that both 
the Nixon Administration and Senator Edward Kennedy have consulted him 
gives some index of his standing. But he is not alone in his judgment "A 
few years ago," I was told by Dr. John Hogness, president of the Institute 
of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences, "the feeling among 
experts was that we would have national health insurance by 1973. Now the 
feeling among experts is that it will take three to five years."<P>
"Not in this Congress," said Bill Fullerton, top staff aide on health to 
Chairman Wilbur Mills of the House Ways and Means Committee. "Not in the 
next Congress. With the confrontation politics we have now, I don't see 
the Democrats giving the Republicans something to crow about, and I don't 
see the Republicans giving the Democrats something to crow about either. 
My personal view is that the earliest it could come would be the second 
year of the next Administration."<P>
A simple way of stating what has happened is that after the passage of 
Medicare in 1965, just about everybody in the world of health policy was 
persuaded that the United States needed something called national health 
insurance--even if there was little agreement on what that should mean. 
Then, rather suddenly in the early 1970s, the mood changed. More cautious 
views reasserted themselves, both among experts and among politicians. The 
same reversal of mood which dampened optimism about the possibility of 
social change through political action generally--in the field of 
education, for example, or in dealing with poverty and urban problems-
has now also begun to shape the debate about health care.<P>
It is not just that congressional enactment of any kind of national health 
insurance, which only a few years ago seemed to be getting closer and 
closer, is now becoming more and more remote. Any form of national health 
insurance enacted in the late 1970s is now likely to be a milder measure, 
involving less drastic change, than seemed inevitable so recently.<P>
One Democrat the Republicans will be especially anxious not to present 
with anything to crow about before 1976 is Senator Kennedy. But the 
strongest push in Congress for a truly radical overhaul of the health care 
system has come from Kennedy, as chairman of the subcommittee on health of 
the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee. Both liberals and organized 
labor--through the Committee for National Health Insurance, set up by the 
late Walter Reuther and backed by George Meany and the AFL-CIO as 
well--have supported Kennedy's "health security" approach. S.3, the 
Kennedy-Griffiths bill (it is sponsored in the House by Representative 
Martha Griffiths, Democrat of Michigan) is the most radical of the half 
dozen or more health insurance bills now before Congress. It offers the 
fullest range of benefits with the fewest co-insurances, deductibles, and 
other snags. It is also the firmest on the principle that if government 
financing is to be made available to the health care system, it must be 
used as leverage to secure government control: leverage to keep down 
rising costs and to make the health system more accountable to government 
in other respects. And with this intent, one of its key proposals has been 
that, as Kennedy put it in his book In Critical Condition in 1972, "The 
Federal government would become the health insurance carrier for the 
entire nation." "Only the government," he wrote, "can operate such an 
insurance program in the best interest of all the people. We can no longer 
afford the health insurance industry in America, and we should not waste 
vast funds bailing it out."<P>
That is a plain enough position, and little more than a year old. Yet 
Kennedy will almost certainly have to retreat from that position, 
and--whatever precise form national health insurance eventually 
takes--insurance companies will almost certainly have an important share 
of the pie.<P>
This is not because of any change of heart on Kennedy's part. It is a 
consequence of the facts of life in Congress. Senator Kennedy has emerged 
as the leading Democratic spokesman on health issues, but he does not have 
the votes to pass his health security bill, even in the Senate. The 
question is academic, in any case, since he cannot bring it to the floor 
for a vote. That prerogative lies with the Senate Finance Committee, 
headed by Senator Russell Long, Democrat of Louisiana. And Long has his 
own bill, artfully contrived to sap the strength of Kennedy's proposals.<P>
Senator Long is in favor of what is called "catastrophic insurance" that 
is, insurance against catastrophically heavy medical bills. Long proposes 
that the federal government insure people only against being hospitalized 
for sixty days and for other medical bills over $2000. Kennedy--unwisely, 
perhaps, from a tactical point of view--has emphasized, in his book and in 
hearings, the havoc caused by "medical catastrophes."<P>
"Catastrophic insurance" would be inflationary in its effect. This is 
because, as things stand now, many people go without treatment that costs 
more than the upper limit imposed by their conventional insurance policy; 
with a federal insurance program footing the bill, more expensive 
treatment would be prescribed and paid for. Moreover, a federal insurance 
scheme limited to the "catastrophic" end of the scale would do nothing to 
meet Kennedy's central concern that the public establish control over the 
costs and procedures of a system that would absorb billions of dollars of 
public money.<P>
"It calms down the flame," Senator Kennedy told me, "but it really doesn't 
meet the need. You're going to be bankrupting people anyway. It adds up to 
an inflationary trend. And I have a philosophic belief that you have to 
use the lever of financing to do something about quality, and something 
about control."<P>
Yet the appeal of "catastrophic insurance," as the lesser of evils for 
politicians and organized medicine if the alternative is a fully 
federalized system, could be very damaging to hopes of more comprehensive 
reform. In 1972, the Senate Finance Committee was already deadlocked on 
Senator Russell Long's "catastrophic insurance" legislation. The coalition 
against it was maintained by Senator Kennedy and his allies, who insisted 
that, if passed, the Long bill meant good-bye to any broader national 
health insurance measure for five years. If Long's bill had been reported 
out of committee, it would almost certainly have passed on the Senate 
floor. "There just aren't enough souls in the Senate hardy enough to vote 
against it," one Kennedy aide said bitterly. And if it had passed the 
Senate, then all would have depended, as it so often does when the shape 
of major legislation is at stake, on one man: Chairman Wilbur Mills of the 
House Ways and Means Committee.<P>
And so, in the summer of 1972, Arkansas Democrat Mills and Massachusetts 
Democrat Kennedy issued a joint statement. They said they would work 
together to draft joint legislation on national health insurance. 
Officially, the line from both the Senator's and the Chairman's staff 
people is noncommittal: "Work is continuing." But in early 1973 Kennedy 
and Mills met several times, and they now hope to introduce a joint bill 
this fall, a bill which would in one major respect be weaker than the 
Kennedy-Griffiths bill.<P>
Kennedy is trying earnestly to find a compromise he can accept without 
betraying what he regards as the essential features of S.3. And Mills is 
trying just as hard to find a bill he can pass. Two main issues remain to 
be resolved.<P>
One is the method of financing. Realistically, national health insurance 
can be financed in only three ways: through the federal budget; through 
Social Security, like Medicare; or through what is known as "mandated" 
coverage. This last approach, favored by the Nixon Administration, would 
have the great bulk of premiums paid by individuals and their employers to 
private insurance companies, so that public funds would be needed only for 
those who could not obtain coverage through their jobs, or for other 
special reasons. On financing, Mills and Kennedy have not yet made up 
their minds. If we had the key to this problem," Senator Kennedy told me, 
"we'd have the legislation."<P>
The second major issue--the role of insurance companies--has now been 
resolved. But Kennedy has made an important concession. He is wary of the 
danger that, whatever regulatory controls Congress sets up over the health 
insurance industry, "in all too short a time the controlled end up 
controlling." That is why he favored eliminating the role of the private 
health insurance industry completely. He now believes, however, that 
"there may be some role, actuarial or procedural, some arrangement that 
could be worked out that would give them some role." One point, in short, 
is now clear. In order to get a version of national health insurance that 
Mills would report out of committee, Kennedy will have to accommodate, in 
some way, the commercial health insurance industry. America, one might say 
with Senator Kennedy, may not be able to afford the health insurance 
industry; but Senator Kennedy cannot afford to do without the health 
insurance industry.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The prospect of Senator Kennedy's crusade for national health insurance 
being transformed into a canny Kennedy-Mills compromise with Aetna, 
Connecticut General, or even W. Clement Stone (the Chicago insurance man 
with the "positive mental attitude" who was, so far as we know, Mr. 
Nixon's biggest campaign contributor in both 1968 and 1972), is 
distressing for those who believe that the American health care system 
needs radical reform.<P>
There are other indications, too, that the middle ground both of academic 
debate and practical politics has taken a step back toward the cautious 
center. But this recent shift should be seen in perspective: it comes 
after some startlingly rapid strides to the left.<P>
Between 1968 and 1970--which is to say, almost overnight, as major shifts 
in political attitudes are measured--certain ideas about health policy 
that had been considered daring even on the liberal Left suddenly became 
widely acceptable. There were two in particular: the idea that the federal 
government should guarantee the availability of health care to all 
citizens through a national health insurance system, and the idea that 
government should actively encourage the replacement of at least some 
fee-for-service practice by prepaid group health arrangements. As late as 
1965, even liberal reformers limited themselves to the complaint that not 
enough health care was available to enough people. But by 1970, to say 
that the American health care system was in crisis had indeed become 
something of a cliche.<P>
In early 1970, President Nixon announced to a press conference that "we 
face a massive crisis in this [health] area. Unless action is taken within 
the next two or three years...we will have a breakdown in our medical 
system." That was well over three years ago and to date there has been no 
legislative action commensurate with such a prophecy. But neither has 
there been anything that could truly be called a breakdown.<P>
No doubt at the time the President believed exactly what he said. His 
assessment was supported by the somber report sent to him by Robert Finch, 
his first Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and Roger Egeberg, 
his first Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs. The 
report posed the alternatives in the starkest terms. "What is at stake," 
it concluded, "is the pluralistic, independent, voluntary nature of our 
health care system. We will lose it to pressures for monolithic, 
government-dominated medical care unless we can make the system work for 
everyone." And this was no idiosyncratic view of Finch's. Two years later 
his successor at HEW, Elliot Richardson, produced a White Paper which, he 
insisted, "seeks to modify the entire SYSTEM of health care" (his 
italics).<P>
The Nixon Administration's policies, even more than its rhetoric, showed 
its conversion at that time to the argument that the system needed 
fundamental change. Each of its two main proposals marked a clear breach 
with the shibboleths of organized medicine. One official who had worked at 
HEW for a decade said to me with awe in his voice: "The atmosphere around 
here changed so much in three or four years that you had a Republican 
President saying, and a Republican Administration doing, things that would 
have raised the roof if Kennedy or Johnson had done them."<P>
One of the two main thrusts of the Administration's strategy was to 
encourage the spread of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO's). The HMO 
concept was co
opted from the prepaid group health idea, of which the California-based 
Kaiser
Permanente plan is the best-known example. The essence of the group health 
idea is that, instead of paying medical bills when they fall due, you pay 
a flat annual sum to join a group which contracts to provide all the 
medical care you may need. Typically, the group either maintains its own 
hospitals, or makes arrangements with particular hospitals to provide 
services; it also employs physicians and other staff. The whole idea has 
long been anathema to organized medicine. For one thing, it turns the 
rugged, individualist, fee-for-service, small-businessman physician into 
an employee. Secondly, with the specific incentive of fee-for-service 
removed, group health schemes have shown consistently lower rates of 
utilization of advanced medical technology, thus stimulating a passionate 
debate among medical academics as to whether group health did too little, 
or fee-for-service doctors did too much.<P>
The notion that Health Maintenance Organizations "might provide a check on 
the provision of unnecessary services, inflation and inequitable 
distribution" of doctors received a boost from the work of Dr. Paul 
Ellwood, Jr., of the American Rehabilitation Foundation in Minneapolis, on 
the grounds that HMO's would "align [the physician's] economic interests 
with those of the consumer." In a paper called "The Health Maintenance 
Strategy," first drafted in March, 1970, and revised in June and October 
that year, Ellwood and his Colleagues seemed to be consciously selling 
HMO's as an alternative to national health insurance. "The Nixon 
Administration must make a major decision on its strategy for dealing with 
the much-proclaimed health crisis in America. It can either rely on 
continued or increased Federal intervention...or promote a health 
maintenance industry...the health maintenance strategy offers...a feasible 
alternative to a nationalized health system."<P>
This argument was apparently persuasive, for in a speech early in 1971, 
Mrs. Beverlee Myers, an assistant administrator at HEW, laid down the 
prerequisites for the types of HMO the federal government would encourage. 
Significantly, Mrs. Myers defined HMO's more widely than liberals would 
have liked: besides the Kaiser-Permanente model, with its own hospitals 
and other specialized facilities, she included organizations modeled on 
the San Joaquin Medical Care Foundation in California, that is to say, 
group practice arrangements, set up by doctors, which RETAINED 
fee-for-service.<P>
One can get the flavor of some of the organizations which qualify as HMO's 
under the Administration's definition by reading a long article published 
by Fortune this spring in which the profit-making possibilities of HMO's 
are glowingly discussed. Their profit ratio, the article argues, could be 
as high as that of oil companies, and one doctor who successfully sold 
stock in his HMO received the highest accolade Fortune has to bestow: "a 
fast-moving entrepreneur." "The most blatant forms of entrepreneurial 
practice qualify as HMO's under the Administration's proposals," comments 
Dr. Victor Sidel, of Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, New York. And Dr. 
Max Fine, of the Committee for National Health Insurance, described to me 
with horror the style of some of the HMO's that flourish in Southern 
California. "They send loudspeaker trucks round the streets," he said. 
"They offer fried chicken to anyone who joins the group. And they send 
solicitors round door to door, and pay them three dollars a head for every 
patient they sign up." One such group health outfit advertises in medical 
journals, offering free use of a company-owned Mercedes to any doctor who 
will join. Sports cars for the doctors, and fried chicken for the 
patients: that was hardly the vision of group health pioneers.<P>
Both with HMO's and with national health insurance, the Republicans 
borrowed a liberal idea and made something very different out of it. 
National health insurance, in fact, has become one of those phrases, like 
the word "liberal," whose meaning has exploded, so that little pieces of 
it are littered all over the political landscape. There is a world of 
difference between the health scheme Labor and Senator Kennedy had in 
mind, and what Republicans have proposed.<P>
There is the matter of the insurance companies. When Elliot Richardson was 
Secretary of HEW, he admitted in congressional testimony that his version 
of national health insurance would have the effect of swelling the premium 
income of private health insurance companies from $23 billion to $30 
billion in the first year, or by some 30 percent. Dr. Fine calculates that 
even this is a substantial underestimate, and that the Administration's 
plan would have produced a windfall for the insurance companies (including 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield) of no less than $12 billion--more than 50 
percent above its current premium income. The fact that in spite of these 
remarkable expectations the insurance industry opposes any form of 
national health insurance as an entering wedge of federal regulation, 
gives some idea of how ideological, and how profitable, the insurance 
business may be taken to be.<P>
But liberals' objections to the Administration's proposals are not limited 
to the observation that they would enrich the insurance industry lavishly. 
The National Health Insurance Partnership, as the Administration called 
its national health insurance proposals, would limit the government's role 
to a minimum. It would merely require that the carrying of a stipulated 
minimum employer-employee health insurance coverage be made a mandatory 
condition of all employment. Those who were not covered in this way would 
be picked up either by a family health insurance plan, replacing Medicaid 
for the poor; or by "pool coverage," arranged in some not too clearly 
specified way for the unemployed, the self
employed, and the employees of small businesses. The government would 
also, under the Administration's plan, set national health insurance 
standards. And here the contrast between coverage proposed in the 
Kennedy-Griffiths bill and the modest benefits (and thickets of 
exceptions) promised by the Administration's bill is so great as to be 
ludicrous.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The principle of national health insurance dates back to the 1930s. It was 
temporarily interred when congressional efforts to enact the 
Wagner-Murray-Dingell bill (first proposed in 1943 after Senator Robert 
Wagner had sponsored a similar bill in 1939) ended in 1950, in the face of 
fierce opposition from the American Medical Association. The AMA assessed 
its members twenty-five dollars a head that year to fight "the enslavement 
of the medical profession."<P>
For nearly two decades the idea lay dormant. Public attention to the 
problem during the 1950s and the early 1960s focused on two efforts, one 
congressional, the other undertaken by private enterprise. Politicians 
abandoned any attempt to involve the government in making medical care 
available to the general population, and concentrated instead on taking 
care of the special problems of the old and the very poor. Ideologically, 
the thrust for the two programs eventually enacted in 1965 came from 
different directions. Medicare--free medical care for the aged under 
Social Security--was a liberal program. But Medicaid--federal assistance 
to the states to provide medical care for the indigent--was attractive to 
conservatives and states
righters, concerned about the growing burden of providing medical care for 
welfare recipients.<P>
One important reason for political indifference to the medical needs of 
working- and middle-class people in those years was the rapid spread of 
private health insurance, both with commercial insurance companies and 
with the "nonprofit" Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. By 1971, more than 
76 million Americans were covered by Blue Cross hospitalization insurance; 
and of these about 66 million had Blue Shield policies for doctors' and 
surgeons' bills. (By contrast, only some 8 million people belonged to 
group health plans organized by the Group Health Association of America, 
of whom some 2 million belonged to the largest plan, Kaiser-Permanente.) 
Spread of health insurance came about largely because hospitals, and, to a 
lesser extent, the doctors, wanted to be assured of payment. Nevertheless 
the proportion of private hospital expenditure paid by insurance 
(excluding all government payments) rose from 34.6 percent in 1950 to 73.7 
percent in 1968. Inadequate as it was, the spread of private health 
insurance for years precluded any clamorous demand for national health 
insurance.<P>
Walter Reuther, shortly before his death, revived public discussion of 
national health insurance. In the Bronfman lecture to the American Public 
Health Association in Detroit on November 14, 1968, less than two weeks 
after President Nixon was elected, he called for "an appropriate system of 
national health insurance that will provide an adequate and workable 
financial mechanism to make high quality comprehensive health care 
available to every American." In January, 1969, Senator Kennedy announced 
that he intended to sponsor a measure to enact such a system. And then, 
abruptly, everybody was talking about national health insurance again. As 
Dr. William McKissick reported in the New England Journal of Medicine:<P>
     "The year 1969 witnessed advocacy of universal health insurance from 
political quarters that ranged from Representative John Dingell...to the 
American Medical Association...Governor Rockefeller, the Aetna Life 
Insurance Company, Senator Javits, Senator Kennedy...Walter Reuther..."<P>
and, he might have added, Reuther's adversaries in the AFL-CIO. When 
President Nixon was converted to the cause, it seemed truly an idea whose 
time had come.<P>
A bureaucratic detail pinpoints the change in official Administration 
attitudes toward health care reform better than all the volumes of 
congressional testimony and the task force reports of the time. For years, 
every draft of health legislation ritually included boiler-plate language 
which, it was believed by congressmen and federal officials, had to be 
inserted to placate the AMA. Section 1801 of the Social Security Act of 
l965, which enacted Medicare, is an example: "Nothing in this title," it 
proclaimed a trifle disingenuously, "shall be construed to authorize any 
Federal officer or employee to exercise any control over the practice of 
medicine or the manner in which medical services are provided."<P>
Suddenly, in the changed climate of l968 and subsequent years, nobody felt 
the need to write in clauses like that anymore. And not only that. Robert 
Ball, who quit this year as commissioner of the Social Security 
Administration, made the point to me that, after 1968 or 1969, most 
experts would have regarded it as a grave deficiency in legislation if it 
did not attempt to exercise some control over "the manner in which medical 
services are provided."<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why did the field of debate about national health policy and the role of 
the federal government shift so sharply to the left after 1968?<P>
In a single word, the answer given by all the experts I talked to was: 
Medicare. The impact of the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 was 
both financial and psychological.<P>
The fact that hospitals and doctors were reimbursed on a cost basis, under 
both programs, accelerated the inflation of medical costs. Medicare and 
Medicaid went into effect in 1966. Within two years, cost inflation had 
reached the proportions of a crisis. And that steep, sudden inflation 
exposed other weaknesses in the health system, and triggered a general 
reassessment of long-accepted assumptions and values.<P>
At the same time, once the federal government was involved in paying for 
health care, essentially for the first time, it became both possible and 
necessary to ask how much further it should be involved. As Wilbur Cohen, 
Secretary of HEW at the time Medicare was enacted in 1965, put it to me: 
"The passage of Medicare broke the back of the ideological controversy 
over the government's role, and opened up the possibility of discussing 
changes in the delivery system." Robert Ball agrees:<P>
     "There has been a most remarkable change in atmosphere. I went all 
through the fight for Medicare, and it would have been unthinkable at that 
time to get stronger legislation in terms of affecting the delivery of 
health care. When Medicare came in it was accepted as an economic measure, 
as something that would protect people against the costs of medical care. 
It was considered as part of the pension system. The great change which 
began fairly soon was that people began to feel that there was a real 
responsibility to do something about cost; to do something about quality; 
and to do something about organization. Medicare was a terrific 
catalyst."<P>
It wasn't long before it became plain that the cost overruns on Medicare 
were going to be spectacular. Between l966 and 1968, everything went up; 
hospital bills, doctors' fees, laboratory charges, insurance premiums, and 
even--though more modestly-
nurses' and orderlies' wages. (At Massachusetts General Hospital in 
Boston, for example, nurses' wages went up 100 percent between 1959 and 
1969; but over the same period interns' salaries went up 1650 percent!) 
Over the decade of the 1960s, hospital charges rose four times as fast as 
all other items in the Consumer Price Index; physicians' fees rose twice 
as fast. And that increase was heavily concentrated in the brief period 
after the introduction of Medicare. The rate of inflation of hospital 
costs, for example, increased from an average of 6.9 percent between l950 
and 1960 to an annual average of 14.8 percent between March, 1966, and 
March, l970.<P>
Some economists [See Endnote 1] have argued that the primary reason for 
inflation was increased demand from patients. But the Nixon 
Administration's own White Paper in 1971 commented that "while undoubtedly 
there were improvements in the quality of care for at least some of the 
population, more than 75% of the increase in expenditures for hospital 
care, and nearly 70% of the increase for physician services, were the 
consequence of inflation."<P>
By 1969, some hospitals were charging as much as $150 a day for basic 
care--in effect for little more than a bed, food, and attention from a 
nurse when she had a moment. John de Lury, of the New York sanitation 
workers' union, gave a state legislative hearing a harrowing illustration 
of what the full cost could come to:<P>
     "A ten-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital at 3:20 A.M. The boy 
died at 10:34 the same night. The family of this child was charged $105.80 
for drugs, $184.80 for X
rays, $220.00 for inhalation therapy, $655.50 for laboratory work. The 
total bill for the child was $1717.80."<P>
With the government reimbursing whatever hospitals and doctors charged, 
the cost of both Medicare and Medicaid spiraled out of control. Less than 
ONE YEAR after Medicare came into operation, Congress had to increase by 
25 percent the Social Security tax budgeted to pay for it. The actuarial 
estimates of both utilization and cost presented to Congress by the 
Administration when the program was under construction proved to be 
hopelessly understated. Cost overruns, projected over the next twenty-five 
years, added up to a stupendous $131 billion.<P>
Medicaid was soon in worse trouble than Medicare. Two reporters, generally 
sympathetic to the program, wrote that "starting in late l966 Medicaid hit 
New York's medical marketplace like a flash-flood." In January, 1967, the 
federal budget, assuming that Medicaid would be in operation in 
forty-eight states by the end of the year, predicted that it would cost 
$2.25 billion. A year later, however, although only thirty-seven states 
were receiving Medicaid, the actual cost came to $3.54 billion.<P>
In human terms, there is no question that both Medicare and Medicaid have 
done incalculable good. Medicare, covering about 21 million people, paid 
portions of bills for roughly half of them last year; allowing for various 
overlaps among programs, Medicaid paid a part of the bills last year for 
about 16 million of the many more people who were eligible. No one can put 
a cash value on the lives that have been prolonged and the suffering saved 
as a result. But there is no denying that by pouring money into the 
medical system on a cost reimbursement basis, Medicare and Medicaid set 
off a wild inflation in costs.<P>
The rise, however, had begun long before Medicare was enacted. The rapid 
spread of health insurance, both with commercial companies and with Blue 
Cross/Blue Shield, had been triggering an inflationary effect since the 
middle 1950s. Private insurance policies worked on a cost reimbursement 
basis, like Medicare, and far from having any deflationary control over 
medical practice, often encouraged EXPENSIVE treatment. Many policies, for 
example, would pay for certain kinds of treatment only in a hospital, a 
proviso that naturally encouraged needless hospitalization.<P>
Secondly, the acceleration of Medicare-induced inflation coincided with 
the general inflation of the late 1960s. Half of the inflation of medical 
costs, Wilbur Cohen believes, is due to the general inflation, which in 
turn he blames on the Vietnam War.<P>
In any case, a flood of new money--Medicare and Medicaid are now paying 
for well over a third of all health care--was poured into the system at a 
moment when medical costs had been rising more quickly than most other 
costs. No serious attempt was made either to increase the number of 
providers or to hold down costs by imposing controls. The result was 
predictable.<P>
The inflationary effect worked differently in the two cases of doctors' 
fees and hospital bills. In the case of physicians' fees, what happened 
was what economists call a "demand-pull" inflation. Since the supply of 
doctors remained virtually stable, greatly increased demand meant that 
doctors could increase their fees (sometimes directly sometimes by 
splitting procedures and thereby charging more for what would have been 
one appointment) and still be sure of the same volume of patients.<P>
Some have argued that hospital costs too, rose mainly in response to 
demand-pull, as an army of new users descended on overstressed resources. 
The argument is attractive to hospital administrators because, if 
accepted, its logical corollary is that even more money should be spent on 
hospitals--something administrators approve of for various reasons. But 
while admissions to hospitals rose by 21 percent over the period from 1961 
to 1969, the supply of hospital beds rose even faster, by 25 percent. 
Medicare and Medicaid did indeed drive hospital costs up, but not by 
stimulating an excess of demand over supply. In the hospitals, there was 
cost-push inflation.<P>
In October, 1968, two economists, Paul S. Feldstein and Saul Waldman, 
correctly summarized what had happened in the Social Security Bulletin:<P>
"In Medicare's first year, the financial position of the hospitals 
improved considerably, possibly as the result of the following factors:<P>
(a) increases in occupancy rates;<P>
(b) reimbursement to hospitals for the cost of services to some aged 
patients, previously provided free or at reduced charges;<P>
(c) reduction of losses from uncollectibles...<P>
(d) payment to voluntary and government hospitals under Medicare of an 
allowance amounting to 2% of allowable costs...<P>
(e) receipt of additional revenue from higher charges."<P>
Why did charges go up? Feldstein and Waldman offered two alternative 
explanations:<P>
"1. Hospital management may have miscalculated the effect of Medicare and 
believed higher charges to non-Medicare patients would be needed because 
it expected less than adequate reimbursement under Medicare.<P>
2. Hospital management may have decided that the early Medicare period, 
which was a period of unusual change in hospital finances and accounting, 
was a convenient time to adjust their charge
schedules."  [They also added a third point: some large hospitals remained 
in deficit even after increasing charges].<P>
That is a gentle way of putting it. Bill Fullerton, in Wilbur Mills's 
office, spelled it out more bluntly. "After Medicare," he told me, "the 
hospitals got paid more than before: they got full cost. And that meant 
that, despite all their protestations to the contrary, for the first time 
they were really making money. I talk to plenty of hospital 
administrators, and they say, 'I have a little list of things I want to do 
for the hospital. When Medicare came along, I could start checking them 
off.'"<P>
John de Lury put it even less kindly, and still accurately:<P>
     "The hospitals with the high patient costs are the newer ones, those 
on the make, with brilliant reputations, with teaching affiliations. Above 
all they are the ones with programs of vast expansion and edifice 
complexes. Their rates are high to support their vast ambitions, and they 
are making us pay through the nose."<P>
The strategic accommodation accepted by the Johnson Administration in 
1965, in order to pass Medicare, was with the hospital people: with the 
American Hospital Association and with Blue Cross. (In most American 
cities, hospital trustees, senior medical staff, and Blue Cross boards are 
so intertwined that it can truthfully be said the deal was made with a 
single interest: "the hospital people") Two main concessions were made. 
Medicare was to be financed by reimbursing costs. And the hospitals were 
to be allowed to choose their own "fiscal intermediaries" to check, audit, 
and authorize disbursement. Some chose private insurance companies. More 
chose Blue Cross. Given the coinciding interests, attitudes, and personal 
contacts of many hospital administrators and of the Blue Cross people who 
were supposed to be riding herd on them, it is not too harsh to say that 
"the hospital people" were given their own ticket to write.<P>
They could, and did, expand their buildings, take on new staff, invest in 
fancy electronic equipment, make generous settlements with the unions--and 
could be paid whatever the bill came to by the feds, just as long as the 
friendly fellows at Blue Cross or at the insurance company said it was OK. 
The result was a bonanza not only for doctors and hospitals but for 
insurers, electronic data processors, surgical dressing manufacturers, 
drug companies, and all the other interests which feed at the $70-billion 
trough of the medical-industrial complex. It was no accident that in the 
years immediately following passage of Medicare, the hottest of the hot 
stocks on Wall Street were those of profit-making nursing homes for old 
people. The promoter of the hottest of them all, the tactfully named Four 
Season Nursing Centers, has just pleaded guilty to the biggest stock fraud 
in American history: $200 million.<P>
What made the Medicare bonanza so attractive was this no-loss proposition: 
the federal government was footing the bill, and the providers were adding 
it up. As two Tufts Medical School professors wrote in 1970: "Medicare has 
proved a better mechanism for insuring the providers than the patients."<P>
Government audits have tightened up recently, and have shown how 
inadequate both sections of the insurance industry, the profit-making 
companies and Blue Cross/Blue Shield, proved at controlling costs. 
Massachusetts Blue Cross, for example, was given a 15 percent increase in 
premiums by the regulatory authority on December 1, 1970, and then filed 
for a further 33 percent increase on May 10, 1971. In the previous two 
years, modest investigation revealed the executive payroll had almost 
doubled. Blue Cross of Chicago was criticized by HEW auditors for using 
Medicare money to pay for first-class air travel and entertainment for its 
executives. And so it went in the commercial companies, too. In certain 
cases, federal auditors found that insurance companies acting as fiscal 
intermediaries programmed their computers to omit from cost-control 
checking procedures hospitals in which the companies had invested.<P>
Two particularly baroque tales illustrate just how free and easy the 
spending was: the episode of the monogrammed golf balls, and the 
rags-to-riches saga of the Medicare Billionaire.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Virginia, Blue Cross was named as the "intermediary" for Medicare, Part 
A (hospital services), and Blue Shield was the ''fiscal agent" on behalf 
of the state for Medicaid. They were charged by the law with deciding 
which "providers"--mainly hospitals in this case--should be paid how much; 
on a "reasonable cost basis." They were then to receive, disburse, and 
account for the money, and apply safeguards against "unnecessary 
utilization of services." The government auditors' report suggests that 
this hardly turned out to be the main problem.<P>
The "Virginia Blues" took on staff until the federal auditors found, two 
years later, that staffing was "about 23% in excess of requirements." They 
bought two big IBM machines, so that while the workload increased by 22.3 
percent, money spent on data-processing jumped 1409.8 percent. Yet, the 
auditors found, the system remained "basically ineffective." Other 
expenditures seemed even harder to justify. Soon after getting the 
Medicare contract, the Virginia Blues built a new office building, and 
spent more than a million dollars on new furniture for it...from the 
furniture company whose sales manager was chairman of the state Blue Cross 
board of trustees' building committee. He did not, however, let that 
position influence him into giving Blue Cross undue bargains. With no 
competitive bidding, Blue Cross paid $1750 each for secretaries' desks.<P>
Medicare was also billed for at least part of the cost of entertainment 
for Blue Cross executives and their "clients"--it would be interesting to 
know whether "clients" means insurees or doctors--including "cocktails, 
beer, wine, alcoholic beverages, tickets for stage plays and football 
games and golf fees." A portion of the cost of a company picnic was 
charged to Medicare, including 1050 buffet dinners, two bartenders, bingo 
prizes, and the rental of six ponies.<P>
The Social Security Administration's auditors commented (dryly) that 
"since alcoholic beverages are not considered stimulants of production and 
do not help to disseminate technical information, they cannot be 
considered allowable costs to the Medicare program."<P>
Finally there were the golf balls. Medicare was charged with one-third of 
$2138.50 paid for thirteen dozen golf balls imprinted with the Blue 
Cross/Blue Shield monogram. Teachers and social workers are not the only 
ones who sometimes benefit more from programs intended to help the poor 
than the poor themselves do.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Shortly after his first inauguration, President Nixon announced the names 
of a select group of trustees for the Nixon Foundation. Most of them were 
either well known to be old friends of the new President, or at least 
heavy campaign contributors. More than one owed a good deal to the 
medical-industrial complex; W. Clement Stone, for example, or Elmer Bobst 
the Vitamin King. But one name was then quite obscure: that of H. Ross 
Perot.<P>
By the end of 1969, after his elevation to the board of the Nixon 
Foundation, H. Ross Perot had become a world celebrity by chartering two 
jets (one of them modestly christened "Peace on Earth") and flying off to 
Southeast Asia in a well publicized attempt to ransom American POW's. By 
1970, with stock of the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, which he 
controlled, selling at over $150 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, 
Perot's personal wealth was authoritatively estimated at $1.5 billion. No 
American, Fortune magazine guessed admiringly, had ever made so much money 
so quickly. But then neither Henry Ford nor John D. Rockefeller, nor even 
Paul Getty, had had federal Medicare funds to help him.<P>
Perot, at one time an IBM software salesman made his big leap in 1965 when 
Texas Blue Cross and Blue Shield subcontracted the data-processing work 
arising under their Medicare contract to the company he had founded in 
1962, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation (EDS). Perot was at that 
time, and remained for almost a year afterwards, a part-time employee of 
Texas Blue Cross; he was manager of their data
processing department at a salary of $20,000 a year. Until then, EDS had 
been small beer. Its turnover had never exceeded $500,000 a year. The Blue 
Cross contract was worth $5 million; the contract ran for three years, 
even though Blue Cross's contract with the government, on which it 
depended, was for only one year. There was no competitive bidding, and 
while the contract between the Social Security Administration and the 
Texas Blues had a provision for the examination of records, the contract 
between Blue Cross and EDS did not. To get ready to handle this tempting 
contract, EDS had enjoyed a vital helping hand: a loan of $8 million from 
the Republic National Bank of Dallas, whose chief executive officer was 
the chairman of Blue Cross.<P>
Once into Medicare and Medicaid work, Perot and EDS never had to look 
back. The corporation's gross revenue rose from $1.6 million in 1966 to 
$47.6 million in 1970. The rate of profit on that revenue rose from 15 
percent in 1966 to 41 percent in 1969, and then fell back to a mere 29 
percent in 1970. By 1971, EDS was doing the electronic data-processing 
work for Medicare in nine states, including four out of the biggest five. 
Two-thirds of its gross revenues have come from Medicare and Medicaid. EDS 
stoutly maintains that it has processed Medicare and Medicaid claims more 
cheaply than they would otherwise have been processed, and this may be 
true. In any case, on its own showing, EDS made profits of up to 41 
percent on turnover, two-thirds of which came straight out of public funds 
which were supposed to be disbursed on a "reasonable cost basis." In other 
words, in a perfectly legal manner, and in less than five years, Ross 
Perot was able to make himself a very wealthy man in a way that would be 
regarded in many other countries as incredible: by owning stock in a 
company that helped other private organizations decide whether the 
government should or should not pay out public funds for the medical care 
of the old and the poor.<P>
In an atmosphere where such things were possible, it was probably 
inevitable that attention should turn from the mechanics of the health 
care system to its ethics. While the escalation of costs forced even 
conservatives to concede that the system faced crisis, liberals--who had 
largely confined themselves to quantitative and economic issues in the 
past--began to make more searching criticisms.<P>
"The cost question turned the spotlight on the other deficiencies of the 
system," said Karl Yordy of the National Institute of Medicine. "It was 
not only the increase in costs produced by the fact that Medicare was on a 
cost-reimbursing basis," thinks Dr. Jack Geiger, the head of the State 
University of New York's new medical school at Stony Brook, "it was the 
rise in costs, plus the failure to deliver health care, that revealed the 
inadequacies of the system. The push for a reassessment of the system came 
from the fact that the cost of health care, and the difficulty of finding 
primary sources of health care, were beginning to hit the white middle 
class."<P>
Whatever the reason, four new, interrelated lines of criticism began to be 
heard in the late 1960s with increasing force. Each probed more deeply 
than the last into the substructure of assumptions that underlay the 
American medical system.<P>
* A new skepticism appeared about the value of technology in medicine; a 
new willingness to question an equation that had been virtually 
unchallenged for a generation; the assumption that good medical care means 
advanced medical technology.<P>
* Institutions, and in particular the dominant institution of modern 
medicine in America, the hospital, became objects of increased 
suspicion.<P>
* The physician's professional authority began to be challenged as never 
before.<P>
* Ultimately, even the traditional ethics of medicine were called into 
question on issues of social and political responsibility.<P>

For over twenty years, from 1948 to 1968, Congress had been persuaded to 
pour money steadily into medical research. Most politicians were aware 
that "health" was an issue with their constituents. But once the AMA 
seemed to block any reform of the health care delivery system, the only 
politically prudent way of showing concern for the health issue was by 
voting money for research. A formidable coalition pressed the good work 
forward. It consisted of lobbyists, led by two indomitable ladies, Mary 
Lasker and Florence Mahoney, and others less free from self-interest; 
congressmen and senators, led by Representative John Fogarty of Rhode 
Island and Senator Lister Hill of Alabama; and research administrators. 
These lobbyists succeeded in increasing congressional appropriations for 
medical research, channeled through the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), from $7 million in 1947 to over $1 billion twenty years later. In 
sixteen out of those twenty years, Congress actually reversed its normal, 
stern, budget-cutting inclinations of those years, and appropriated more 
money than the Administration was asking for. [See Endnote 2]. Not 
coincidentally, in the late 1950s and the early 1960s, the public began to 
read more and more about the wonders of arcane medical technology: about 
miracle drugs, and magic surgery and electronic aids to diagnosis, and 
eventually about "space age medicine."<P>
Dr. Jack Geiger was strategically situated to observe this phenomenon. He 
had run OEO-funded health centers in Mississippi and Boston before heading 
up SUNY's new medical school at Stony Brook. But before going to medical 
school he had been a science reporter for UPI, where it was his job to 
chronicle the marvels of the new medical technology. As a result of that 
experience he is convinced that inflated propaganda during those years led 
eventually to a backlash of skepticism about what technology could achieve 
in medicine.<P>
"There was endless publicity about the cure for cancer, the cure for heart 
disease, and so on," Geiger said, putting audible quotation marks around 
the word "cure." "People began to feel it was only a matter of time before 
the brilliant, dedicated doctors discovered a cure for death."<P>
He was hardly exaggerating. In 1961, President Kennedy was interviewed on 
NBC's Today show by Dave Garroway, who asked him: "Will we eventually cure 
everybody? Will the health of the nation approach perfection someday, by 
care and research?" And it wasn't only gushing television interviewers who 
seemed in the early 1960s to assume that research would "cure everybody" 
someday. For Mary Lasker, Stephen Strickland has written, "the conquest of 
disease was...an obtainable goal," while many senators thought that 
conquest was "assured, if not imminent."<P>
And yet, after twenty years of these unprecedentedly high expenditures on 
research, American medicine, far from "curing everybody," was unable to 
prevent public health standards from slipping behind those of many other 
countries with far smaller resources. By the time the l970 United Nations 
Demographic Yearbook was published, the United States was seventeenth in 
the international league table in infant mortality, behind Hong Kong, 
Western Samoa, and Fiji as well as most countries of Western Europe. 
Twelve countries, plus two of the constituent republics of the Soviet 
Union, the Ukraine and Byelorussia, claimed a higher life expectancy for 
females, and another six came within one year of the U.S. figure of 
seventy-four years; while in life expectancy for males, in spite of all 
the money spent on research into cancer, heart disease, and stroke, the 
United States ranked thirtieth, behind Spain, Greece, and five countries 
in Communist Eastern Europe. [See Endnote 3].<P>
A reaction against the prevailing faith in technology was to be expected, 
and it came. Doctors and laymen began to wonder whether American medicine 
was not placing too heavy an emphasis on drugs, surgery, and research, at 
the expense of primary and preventive health care. Medical academics began 
to show a new interest in foreign medical practice. The National Health 
Service in Britain, once beyond the American pale because it was 
"socialized medicine," has probably been more comprehensively studied in 
the last five years by American than by British scholars. Scandinavian 
public health has attracted almost as much attention.<P>
These comparative studies came back with some disturbing information. One 
study [See Endnote 4] found, for example, that twice as much surgery was 
performed in proportion to population in the United States as in England 
and Wales. This might have been taken as comforting proof of the 
old-fashioned reluctance of British surgeons to operate--except for the 
awkward fact that rates of surgery in American group health plans also 
turned out to be half those reported for Blue Shield fee-for
service practice. In other words, those American surgeons who earn a fee 
every time they operate perform twice as many operations as British 
surgeons. And worse, When American surgeons had a financial incentive to 
operate, they did so twice as often as when they had none. Another study 
showed that the incidence of tonsillectomies in California was twice as 
high as it was in Sweden, a country with outstandingly high standards of 
health care for children. Numerous other studies, not on an international 
comparative basis (a study of New York teamsters' and their families' 
health, for example), supported the suggestion that a disturbingly high 
proportion of elective surgery was unnecessarily performed.<P>
Another trend fed the new skepticism: a galloping increase in 
specialization within the health professions. "Virtually all the 
attributes and the attending problems of modern American medicine," the 
medical sociologist Rosemary Stevens wrote in 1970, "spring from the 
gigantic technological achievements...which both precipitated and were 
facilitated by functional specialization." The general practitioner was 
becoming extinct. By 1970, there were twice as many men and women training 
for a single surgical specialty--orthopedic surgery--as for general 
practice. By 1968, 70 percent of all the physicians in the country claimed 
to be specialists. A majority of doctors, perhaps, continued to equate 
increased specialization with increased skill. And yet there was a growing 
awareness that while specialization, like research, had undoubtedly raised 
the standard of the best treatment--in the sense that sophisticated 
diagnosis, medication, and surgery were available--progress in these 
fields had failed to bring a commensurate improvement in standards of 
overall care, in contrast to those of other countries.<P>
In 1969, for only the second time in two decades, Congress slashed the NIH 
budget. The cuts were a consequence of two unrelated events: the Vietnam 
squeeze on domestic spending and stinging criticisms of NIH's financial 
management by a House subcommittee headed by Representative L. H. 
Fountain, Democrat of North Carolina. The cuts, while not very large, 
signaled a change of mood. By the end of the 1960s, the prevailing 
disposition in Congress, and among those in the general public who thought 
about medical policy, was to concede that research remained important, but 
to insist that improving the delivery and reducing the cost, of health 
care must have priority over the litany of "cancer, heart disease and 
stroke."<P>
A similar sequence can be traced in attitudes toward the hospital as an 
institution. Most of the high technology medicine is practiced in 
hospitals, so that for a time they, and their fund-raising efforts, 
benefited from the prestige of the new miracles that were being performed 
in them. Moreover, with the proliferation of specialists, many thoughtful 
analysts envisioned a greatly expanded role for hospitals as medical 
centers, coordinating the diagnosis and treatment of both in-patients and 
outpatients.<P>
But by the end of the decade, attitudes toward hospitals were changing. 
Too many people were being hospitalized, partly because of technological 
trends, but even more because of the way insurance policies were being 
written. The average cost of hospitalization increased by 75 percent 
between 1966 and 1969.<P>
Just at this moment, for largely professional reasons, a new wave of 
liberal and radical medical academics (many of them students of "social 
medicine," a new discipline for which universities and medical schools 
were setting up departments during these very years) wanted to see the 
hospitals' role diminished. "The principle of the hospital as the center 
of care, including ambulatory care, is being challenged," wrote Dr. Jack 
Geiger at about this time. "People shouldn't go to the hospital unless 
they have to," said Dr. Victor Sidel of Montefiore in the Bronx. "Why 
not?" I asked. "Because hospitals are dangerous places." He went on to 
explain that hospitalization may serve as a depressant where patient 
morale is concerned, and that the danger of infection persists in even the 
best-run modern hospital.<P>
Hospitals were also being assailed from without. They were being attacked 
by poor people, especially poor black people, and by their radical allies, 
black and white. The charge was that at best they were unresponsive to 
community needs, and, at worst, arrogant and racist. The attack was made 
at many levels: in sophisticated academic argument; as part of radical 
confrontation tactics; and in the heat of spontaneous outbursts of anger 
and despair.<P>
In 1970, Barbara and John Ehrenreich, who had been associated with a group 
of radical medical reformers called the Health Policy Advisory Center 
(Health-PAC), distilled the radical critique into a forceful and 
provocative book, The American Health Empire. Their thesis is one of 
alluring simplicity. Liberals, they say, are always lamenting the lack of 
system in the American health industry, or complaining that "the system 
doesn't work." They are wrong, say the Ehrenreichs. There is indeed a 
health system in America, and it works efficiently enough. The catch is 
that its primary objective is not to provide good health care for the 
American people. The FIRST priority of the system, say the Ehrenreichs, is 
to make money; and this the health industry does in a highly efficient 
manner, for doctors, drug manufacturers, insurance companies, and the rest 
of the medical-industrial complex, including "nonprofit hospitals, which 
take their profits in power, in salaries for administrators and medical 
staff, and in real estate."<P>
The second priority, the book goes on to argue, is research, which the 
industry needs to make profits, and which requires the clinical data 
provided by patients, especially in hospitals. The third priority is 
training more doctors, to perpetuate the system. Here, too, a supply of 
patients, preferably poor patients with "interesting" conditions, is 
required. [See Endnote 5]. Some doctors will go on to do research Some 
will teach. Most will make money, for themselves and for the medical
industrial complex. And, incidentally, they will have to provide health 
care for the American people.<P>
This cynical but compelling analysis is supported by a historical 
interpretation. The Ehrenreichs argue that a three-stage revolution of 
scale has occurred in American medicine, analogous to the development from 
small business to corporation to giant multinational conglomerate. First, 
the individual doctor in private practice began to give way to the 
hospital: by 1969 less than 29 percent of the nation's health expenditures 
went to individual doctors. Then, even before this process had run its 
course, individual hospitals became dependent on the medical schools and 
teaching hospitals. In the last twenty years, almost all hospitals and 
health centers in New York, and a very large number of doctors in 
practice, have come under the medical and organizational influence of 
Columbia-Presbyterian, Einstein-Montefiore, and the city's five other 
major teaching hospital complexes. The same process has occurred in 
Baltimore, Philadelphia, Boston, Houston, Los Angeles, and other major 
cities. The resulting networks of affiliated institutions the Ehrenreichs 
call "health empires," and they argue that these empires have an 
institutional compulsion to expand, in order to attract the talent and the 
money--both from the federal government and from private foundations and 
bequests--they need to stay on top.<P>
Radicals like the Ehrenreichs generally argue that these newly emerging 
giant medical institutions carry within them the seeds of their own 
destruction. Almost all of them are located in the inner 
city--Columbia-Presbyterian, for example, on the fringes of Harlem--where 
the contrast between their wealth and privilege and conditions in the 
surrounding community will inevitably lead to dialectical contradictions 
and ultimately to conflict.<P>
To a limited extent, the people of the ghettos began to verify this 
prediction. However, just as in ghetto rioting between 1964 and 1968, 
small, local businesses were attacked while major symbols of social and 
economic power--like the General Motors building, an oasis in the flames 
of Detroit--were left untouched, old, poor hospitals bore the brunt of the 
trouble, not the rich, expanding medical complexes. Confrontations have 
occurred between administrators and insurgents in several big
city hospitals: Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, Cook County in Chicago, San 
Francisco General, and D.C. General in Washington, for example. The 
insurgents in each case were young, mainly white, middle-class radical 
doctors; or community militants; or some combination of these.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The suspicion that, for all its technical achievement, American medicine 
was falling away from both professional ethics and the concept of social 
responsibility was not confined to radicals or to the young. Consider, for 
example, the following harsh judgment on the quality of treatment 
dispensed to recipients of Medicaid:<P>
     "The task force, along with what is possibly a majority in the health 
profession and certainly a majority of the population interprets the 
recent Federal enactments [those, that is, establishing Medicaid] as 
intending that access to basic medical care shall be a right or 
entitlement....That right or entitlement is not fulfilled when millions in 
the population...are given a kind of service that is woefully inferior by 
every standard known to man or doctor."<P>
That statement is taken from no radical diatribe. It is a quotation from 
the official report of a task force set up by the Nixon Administration to 
study Medicaid, with staff support from HEW, and chaired by the president 
of the Blue Cross Association of Chicago, Walter McNerney. In a paper 
written in 1972, Dr. Victor Sidel summed up the anguished reassessment 
that had been taking place in a thousand lectures, papers, and medical 
conferences: "Everything that we have learned about how clever we are, how 
important we are, how relevant we are, how trusted we are, how 
self-sacrificing we are, will have to be re-examined."<P>
Besides speeches, reports, and articles, the wave of dissatisfaction with 
medical practice manifested itself in a variety of ways, on the part of 
both doctors and their patients. Doctors demanded peer review of each 
other's professional performance. Many medical experts argued for the 
development of a paraprofessional class, to relieve doctors of some part 
of their medical monopoly. Most significantly, malpractice suits against 
doctors rose sharply, and courts increasingly had a tendency to find for 
the plaintiffs, the patients.<P>
Writing in the Spring, 1973, issue of The Public Interest, sociologist 
Nathan Glazer discussed this last phenomenon and expressed a concern felt 
by many Americans in the years of the great medical bonanza. He pointed 
out that the incidence of malpractice suits in England or in Sweden had 
not greatly increased, and asked<P>
     "why the best-paid doctors in the world--at least some of them--seem 
to find it necessary to engage in barely legal or illegal practices in 
order to force their incomes higher? Or is it indeed because they are the 
best-paid doctors in the world that so many have engaged in profiteering 
at the public expense?...Is it possible that the somewhat greater distance 
between healing and monetary payment that generally prevails in England 
and Sweden contributes to a morally healthier medical profession?"<P>
In that same article, reviewing recent academic studies of the American 
health system, Professor Glazer reports a "recent backlash of defense for 
the American health system."<P>
If, in the late 1960s, congressional faith in Unlimited research 
expenditure wavered under the influence of a new concern with the human 
problems of health care delivery, and a new skepticism about technology, 
that skepticism was rather short
lived. The "dread disease lobby" soon reasserted itself. In January, 1971, 
President Nixon proposed (with the support, incidentally, of Senator 
Kennedy) to set up a new, separate National Cancer Institute. He advocated 
it with the old can-do rhetoric about the need for the kind of effort 
"that split the atom and took man to the moon." The rest of the medical 
research community was strong enough to prevent this dismemberment of NIH. 
But by the end of 1971, Congress enacted, and the President signed, a new 
Cancer Act, authorizing $1.6 billion over three years for a new "assault" 
on cancer. At the medical schools, the high tide of radicalism is said to 
have crested.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even before its attention was distracted and its energies paralyzed by 
Watergate, the Administration had lost any sense of urgency about national 
health insurance. Indeed it had all but abandoned its plans in their 
original form. Before he left HEW on his way to the Justice Department via 
the Pentagon, Elliot Richardson had his staff prepare what came to be 
called the Mega proposal. This was a secret plan for comprehensive 
"simplification and reform" of the more than 300 HEW categorical social 
programs. In general, the plan followed the lines of the Administration's 
general philosophy of revenue-sharing and "the New Federalism"--not to 
mention its desire to cut back domestic spending.<P>
The health section, which soon leaked out, proved of special interest. For 
one thing, it contained a harshly explicit critique of the 
Administration's own national health insurance proposals. "Many billions," 
it said, would be needed to convert these into a "true universal 
entitlement plan with a comprehensive benefit plan." In its place, the 
Mega paper suggested a new concept: Maximum Liability Health Insurance. In 
effect this was a much liberalized version of the concept of "catastrophic 
insurance." The government would provide cover from the "catastrophic" end 
of the scale down to a maximum liability fixed for each individual 
according to his income. Below that level he would be on his own, at 
liberty either to pay his own bills or to insure himself in the market.<P>
This scheme derived largely from the theories of Dr. Martin Feldstein, the 
Harvard economist who worked as a consultant on the Mega proposal. 
Feldstein has now spelled out the maximum liability concept under another 
name ("major risk insurance," or MRI) in an article in the June, 1973, 
issue of the AMA magazine, Prism.<P>
     "Every family would receive a comprehensive insurance policy with an 
annual direct expense limit...scaled so that families with higher incomes 
would be responsible for larger amounts of their medical bills...the 
expense limit might start at $300 per year for a family with an income 
below $3,000. It might be ten percent of the income of persons earning 
between $3,000 and $10,000 and $1,000 for incomes above that level. MRI could be improved by introducing a 
coinsurance feature above that basic deductible...."[See Endnote 6].<P>
Feldstein argues that his scheme would not only prevent financial hardship 
for individuals but would also save billions of dollars in public money, 
both by removing the existing tax deductions for medical expenses (though 
of course these could be removed in conjunction with any other reform) and 
by making people "more cost conscious in spending their own money and this 
in turn would help to check inflation."<P>
Feldstein is an economist, but his analysis seems almost oblivious to 
noneconomic factors. In one of his papers, he attributes rising costs 
primarily to rising demand on the part of patients, brushing aside the 
degree to which it is doctors, and not patients, who make the effective 
decisions about the demand for treatment. He argues that the best way to 
measure the benefits of hospital care is in dollars! In short, he, and 
others of his school, analyze the medical system as if it were a 
marketplace like any other. They advocate "deductibles," "coinsurance," 
and other devices to make the patient spend his own money when he needs 
medical care precisely because such devices help to turn medical decisions 
into economic ones.<P>
The revival of respect for essentially economic prescriptions for the 
health care crisis was to be expected. But it marked the end of a period 
in which economic problems caused a revaluation of the noneconomic 
deficiencies of the medical system.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Both the shift to the left in the late 1960s and the subsequent reaction 
can be explained by factors intrinsic to the health care system--up to a 
point. There is, as I have tried to show, a great deal of evidence that 
the way Medicare and Medicaid were introduced led to a rapid rise in 
medical inflation, and that inflation led to reassessment, to a sense of 
crisis, and to a change in the whole climate for reform of the system. The 
reaction can also be explained in terms of developments within the world 
of medicine. If rapidly rising costs led to a sense of crisis, then it can 
hardly be irrelevant that inflation of health costs has slowed down. Harry 
Schwartz, in his spirited 1972 book called The Case for American Medicine, 
claims that "between August 1971 and August 1972, the medical price index 
rose only 2.2%, substantially less than the cost of living rose in the 
same period." Checking with other health economists, I found that there is 
some dispute about the extent to which government policy from Phase I to 
Phase IV braked the inflation of medical costs, but it is not disputed 
that the sharp rise of the late 1960s is now over. Indeed, to the extent 
that the sharp inflation was caused by fee increases that would not be 
repeated for some time to come, it would be odd if the rate of inflation 
had not slackened off. And again, to the extent that the rise in costs 
created a new propensity to ask fundamental questions about the system, 
the passing of the wave in medical costs would naturally be expected to 
presage some calming of the clamor for reform.<P>
But I suspect that something larger is also involved. The striking thing 
is how closely the changes in political and intellectual attitudes to the 
health care system have mirrored the changes in other areas of American 
life.<P>
A parallel from the history of higher education may illustrate what I 
mean. In August, 1967, Christopher Jencks and David Riesman finished 
writing a book about American universities, which they called The Academic 
Revolution. In January, 1969, they sat down to write a preface to the 
second edition. In the intervening seventeen months, all hell had broken 
loose on American campuses. The "revolution" of their title, to the extent 
that it was more than merely metaphorical, had been a slow, gradual 
affair, transforming universities over a couple of decades. Now, to the 
embarrassment of Jencks and Riesman, people were rushing out to buy their 
book in the hope of getting some understanding of what looked like an 
all-too
literal academic revolution.<P>
This experience set Jencks and Riesman to measuring, in their second 
preface, the sheer speed of change in American attitudes to higher 
education since they had started studying it at the end of the l950s. 
Then, they recalled,<P>
     "both educators and laymen seemed appallingly complacent about 
American higher education...the only widespread complaints about higher 
education were that Americans needed more of it...Almost all educators 
accepted the legitimacy and authority of the academic profession a few 
years ago, even when they criticized specific aspects of its operation. 
Today all this has changed...the public is becoming more skeptical about 
educators' claims...educators are far less sure than they were that their 
traditions and values are worth defending...a small but growing minority 
seems convinced that the academic system...is not just blemished but 
fundamentally rotten."<P>
Change only a few words--"educators" into "doctors," "academic" into 
Medical," and so on--and this could stand as a summary of what happened in 
American medicine in the late 1960s. It was as true of American medicine 
as of higher education in the 1950s and the early 1960s--probably more 
true--that "the only widespread complaints were that Americans needed more 
of it."<P>
The crisis of confidence of the late 1960s, in short, seems to have 
followed the same course in the universities as it did in medicine, and in 
fact as it did in the life of other social institutions as well. Doubt, 
criticism, crisis, radical challenges to old assumptions and established 
structures of authority and a willingness even on the part of 
conservatives to move out of entrenched positions and accept a surprising 
degree of change: these were the characteristics of the years from l966 to 
l970. Then the old assumptions, the defenders of the status quo and the 
doubts about the doubts began to have their turn once again.<P>
The reasons for this pattern, I am suggesting, lie only partly inside the 
medical system itself, in the consequences of Medicare, or in the 
operation of demand-pull and cost-push. For, much as some of its leaders 
would like it to, the medical system does not in the end operate in 
isolation from the general mood of American life. In the most specific 
ways, medical institutions, like other institutions, felt the impact not 
only of liberal reform but also of the Vietnam War, of inflation, the 
civil rights movement, feminism, student dissent, and ghetto anger. It 
also felt the reaction to the great national crisis of the 1960s: the 
disillusionment with rising federal budgets, the impatience of the white 
middle class with strident radicalism, the counterattack of organized 
interest groups, and the stubbornness with which conservative 
intellectuals have patched up intellectual defenses of the free enterprise 
status quo.<P>
Yet most of the things that were wrong with American medicine when 
President Nixon thought the system faced imminent breakdown are wrong with 
it now. Americans still spend far more on their health than people 
anywhere else in the world, and live shorter lives than do the inhabitants 
of many of the countries Americans' ancestors emigrated from in the 
nineteenth century.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What are the prospects for change at this time? The initiative for health 
care reform having passed to Congress, the eventual shape of national 
health insurance will emerge from the tete-a-tetes between Senator Kennedy 
and Chairman Mills. Even if they do succeed in drafting a bill by the 
fall, it will have to wait in line behind both tax and trade legislation 
in what have become overcrowded sea-lanes leading to the Ways and Means 
Committee. Even if legislation is drafted late this year, it is realistic 
to guess that it would not become law before, say, 1977. Perhaps five 
years have been lost.<P>
This is not the result of any obstructionist desire on the part of Wilbur 
Mills. The chairman may be an old gray fox, a pragmatist who keeps his 
cards up against his chest until he plays them. But he is also a positive 
man, a master craftsman of consensus. He personally wants to pass a 
historic--which means a substantial-
national health insurance bill before he retires. He has steered thousands 
of pieces of legislation through Congress. But Medicare was to have been 
his monument. He sees that monument as slightly tarnished, by inflation 
and by the suggestion of incompleteness. National health insurance would 
be a fitting crown for one of the great congressional careers.<P>
Mills does not think such a bill can be passed unless it includes a 
role--some role, however limited--for the insurance industry. On the other 
great issue, the method of financing, the evidence is that neither Kennedy 
nor Mills has yet committed himself. And there are good reasons why they 
should not commit themselves yet. The deficit is so high that it would be 
hard to finance a major measure through the budget. Social Security is so 
high that it would be hard to increase that for a while. And the 
"mandated" employer-employee approach has several disadvantages--not least 
that it belongs to the Republicans. No wonder many experts are turning 
toward some gradualist approach to national health insurance. They want to 
crawl up to it unobserved, and wave the flag only when there is a victory 
to announce.<P>
One such gradualist tactic would start with the catastrophic approach and 
transform it bit by bit. If the Long bill took effect, not at $2000 and 
sixty days, but at $100 and a week, we would wake up one morning to find 
that Congress had amended it into national health insurance. In theory, 
Martin Feldstein's idea of starting at the top and working down could be 
extended piecemeal even more effectively. A third approach, which both 
Mills's and Kennedy's staff have examined, would be to start with mothers 
and children--for example, with federal coverage of prenatal care, 
delivery, and postnatal care up to the age of five. That would have 
numerous advantages. Good health care in the first five years of life is 
cheap--it need cost no more than $5-7 billion a year, Dr. Rashi Fein 
calculates. It also reduces the need for more expensive care later in 
life. And motherhood is notoriously hard to oppose politically.<P>
Senator Kennedy admits the attraction of such gradualist ideas. But for 
him they all suffer from the same philosophic weakness. They give the 
government no leverage to reform the health care system as a whole and 
they therefore risk repeating the experience of Medicare. His personal 
preference is for Social Security as a method of financing, and for an 
interesting reason. His thinking goes back to what was perhaps the most 
important single cause of the mood of reaction we have been witnessing 
recently: the feeling on the part of many middle-class people that they 
were left out by the liberal reforms of the 1960s. Again, it is worth 
noticing that the argument is in no way specific to the medical field; it 
applies to social policy as a whole. Kennedy told me:<P>
     "I think there's one lesson we learned in the 1960s and that is that 
programs which are directed toward alleviating social needs ought to be 
targeted in a universal way. What is the most successful social program we 
have in this country? Social Security. And why? Because it's universal. A 
policeman in Boston, for example, isn't going to be against a particular 
program that helps the blacks, so long as he's being helped too. Once he 
feels the pressures on him are being taken care of, I think he's 
enormously tolerant of doing something for the disadvantaged--so long as 
he feels that things are moving along for him too."<P>
That is the language of consensus politics. It is, interestingly, 
identical with the view of Irving Kristol, who, through his editorship of 
the journal The Public Interest and friendship with Ambassador Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, had a considerable influence on the social policies of 
the first Nixon Administration. And it may well be true that it will take 
a return to consensus politics, on Capitol Hill and perhaps in the White 
House too, if the Democrats can recapture it, before a major national 
health insurance measure is passed.<P>
But the important weakness in the American health care system which the 
crisis of the late 1960s revealed was not the organizational and financial 
crisis which a cautious, compromise brand of national health insurance 
would deal with. It was the entrepreneurial concept of the doctor's social 
role, the intimate relationship, in Nathan Glazer's formulation between 
healing and monetary reward, which has prevented a real, indeed a 
brilliant, improvement in medical technique from being translated into 
commensurate improvement in medical care. Cleansed of the entrepreneurial 
temptations which the Administration's interpretation has allowed, the 
Health Maintenance Organization could develop into the key institution in 
a transformation of the economic structure of medicine which would 
diminish the conflict between the doctor's and the patient's interests. 
Probably the best hope of spreading the HMO system would be by linking it 
with a national health insurance system; and there are certainly ways in 
which this could be done. But it is clear that in the crisis of the 1960s 
an opportunity for reforming one of the least attractive aspects of 
American life arrived, and was lost.

Elizabeth Drew in The Atlantic of December, 1967. Mrs. Drew 
pointed out that cancer, heart disease, and stroke, 
which received the lion's share of congressional attention,
 happen to be the major medical threats to elderly, middle-class males,
  the demographic category to which all the key congressional figures belonged.
   The story has also been well told in detail by Stephen P.
    Strickland in Politics, Science and Dread Disease (Harvard 
    University Press, 1972).<p>

3. These international rankings are not absolutely precise,
 for two reasons. National statistics do not all date from 
 the same year. And not all territories included in the U.N.
  data are sovereign nations. I have, for example, excluded 
  Northern Ireland and the Ukraine (both of which have higher
   life expectancy than the United States). Interestingly, 
   two U.S. dependencies, Puerto Rico and the Ryuku Islands,
    also have higher male life expectancy than the United States.<p>

 in Tuskegee, Alabama, had been paying black syphilis patients to forgo
  treatment in the interests of research illustrated how far medical 
  researchers were prepared to go. It also stimulated debate among civil 
  libertarians and on Capitol Hill about defining new canons of research 
  ethics.<p>

6. The Rising Cost of Hospital Care, National Center for Health 
Services Research and Development, in 1971. Feldstein complains 
that "the role of increasing demand as the primary cause" of 
cost increases "is not generally understood," in spite of the 
fact that he has taken the trouble to demonstrate it with "a 
formal mathematical model." Yet at times he seems a little confused
 on this point himself: he concludes his paper by saying that "our 
 current methods of hospital insurance have encouraged hospitals...
 to increase the sophistication and expensiveness of their product 
 more rapidly than the public actually wants." The trouble, in fact,
  has come from a special type of "demand," usually known to those 
  unfamiliar with Feldstein's formal mathematical model as 
  "supply."</blockquote><p>

<blockquote>
	<i><font size=4>A Boston physician of leading and liberal opinion, CHANNING FROTHINGHAM 
was physician to the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital form 1912 to 1933, and 
has been consultant physician since 1933. He was a member of the faculty 
of the Harvard Medical School from 1908 to 1933, when he became 
physician-in-chief of the Faulkner Hospital.</i></font><p>

	<font size=5>M</font>any Americans do not receive adequate medical care. The figures presented 
by the Selective Service Examiners in 1942 and 1943 showed that throughout 
the United States 39.2 per cent of the registrants examined by the Local 
Boards and at the Induction Centers were rejected. This high percentage of 
our boys found unfit to fight was not evenly distributed throughout the 
country. For instance, in Oregon there were only 24.4 per cent rejected 
and in Kansas 25.4 per cent. On the other hand, in North Carolina 56.8 per 
cent were rejected and in Arkansas 55.9 per cent. Between these two 
extremes, Massachusetts and New York had 37.7 per cent rejected. Usually 
the poorer the state, the more neglect of health.<P>
Good medical care includes the activities of the public health 
services--Federal, state, and local--and the preventive medical 
procedures, diagnosis, and treatment for the sick provided by practicing 
physicians. Public health services vary not only from state to state, but 
also in different communities within a state. In recent years the Federal 
government has been contributing more and more towards the public health 
programs of the states, the size of the appropriation varying, with a 
higher percentage of assistance offered to the less wealthy states. In the 
fiscal year 1946, Massachusetts, for instance, paid $3,930,399 for its 
Department of Public Health, and to the Commonwealth in the same year the 
Federal government contributed $3,158,842; in addition, the Department of 
Mental Health in Massachusetts, which cares for the mentally ill, had a 
budget of $14,053,672 drawn from state funds.<P>
The activities of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health include 
diagnosis and treatment of the sick as well as an extensive program for 
the prevention of disease. The Department runs biological and diagnostic 
laboratories. It has food and drug laboratories with inspection service. 
It has a Division of Sanitary Engineering involved in the control of water 
supply and sewage disposal. It also is closely allied with the Department 
of Labor and Industries in the study of occupational hygiene. It is active 
in dental health and in the study and control of communicable diseases. It 
has responsibility for various hospitals and out-patient clinics for the 
control and treatment of tuberculosis. It has clinics for the control and 
treatment of venereal diseases. It also has responsibility for the 
Emergency Maternal and Infant Care Program. The Department not only deals 
with general health problems but participates in the care of the sick. 
This emphasizes a point which is not always appreciated: namely, that you 
cannot separate the health of the individual from the public health. In 
addition to what the state does, the individual cities and towns in 
Massachusetts support their own public health agencies.<P>
In the years to come there will be continued expansion of the activities 
of the Departments of Public Health in the different states. The diagnosis 
and care of more and more patients will undoubtedly come under the control 
of these departments, if one can judge by the steady growth of these 
services in the past. Even in those communities already well supplied, the 
demand for the extension of health services exists, as is shown by 
requests for more legislation and for increased appropriations.<P>
The problem of developing satisfactory public health services in a good 
medical program is complicated by the lack of well-trained public health 
officers. It is further complicated by the opposition of some practicing 
physicians. Such hostility often develops when the state encroaches upon 
the field of the private practitioner or laboratory expert, even if the 
patient's advantage is served. To develop satisfactory public health 
services in a National Health Program, therefore, further education of 
both laymen and physicians is essential. Physicians must be attracted into 
the service by satisfactory financial reward. Public health services are 
expensive, and it is obvious that more Federal aid will be necessary for 
some states if the advantages of such services is to be evenly 
distributed. As disease does not recognize state lines, measures to 
protect us from preventable illness should be uniform throughout the 
country.<P>
All the studies show that physicians, laboratories, and hospitals are very 
unevenly distributed through out the United States. For example, in New 
York City there is one physician to every five hundred inhabitants, while 
in the United States as a whole there is one physician to every seventeen 
hundred. Clearly, many areas do not have the hoped-for percentage of one 
physician for every thousand of the population.<P>
Good medicine cannot be practiced without laboratories, hospitals, and 
well-trained specialists. The lack of these facilities and specialists 
leaves many areas unable to attract well-trained practicing physicians. 
Furthermore, the resulting overcrowding of physicians in our urban centers 
where these facilities exist produces another problem, because even in 
these areas there are not enough hospitals to provide all the physicians 
with hospital privileges. Many communities are unable to raise the funds 
necessary to supply suitable hospitals and laboratories and to guarantee 
proper financial return to the physicians. Therefore, some plan must be 
developed to aid the poorer communities in the states.<P>
The most serious obstacle in making good medical care available to the 
people is its cost. The following table shows the usual charges for 
certain operations in a hospital in which different types of 
accommodations exist for the comfort of the patients. These are actual 
figures supplied by reliable and conscientious surgeons.<P>

It is estimated that more than half the families in the United States have 
incomes of less than $2000 a year. How can such families meet these 
charges? Some distribution of the justifiable costs for specialists' 
services must be arranged for the majority of our population.<P>
Furthermore, in a well-organized medical program the family physician who 
gives the preventive inoculations and the periodic examinations, and makes 
the early diagnosis, and who will take care of all conditions which do not 
need specialists' services, should receive an adequate income. Many people 
cannot afford complete care on the present fee-for-service basis and 
therefore do without these preventive and other important medical 
procedures. Some program must be devised to provide to a vast number of 
our people a family physician of their own choice.<P>
Another troublesome factor is that this method of paying for medical care 
by individual fees tempts many to gamble on avoiding preventable diseases 
by self
medication, drug-clerk diagnosis, and the employment of cultists, all in 
the hope that they will be less expensive than a good doctor.<P>
<BR>
<b>2.</b><P>
The amount of money spent annually on medical care for individuals in the 
United States is estimated at about $4,000,000,000. Those who have studied 
the possibilities believe that this sum is sufficient to provide good 
individual care for all the people and to reimburse the physicians 
adequately.<P>
The problem, therefore, is to develop a plan to collect this sum in a 
manner consistent with the individual's ability to pay and then to spend 
it so that good medical care will be available to all the contributors. 
Obviously there will always be some who cannot contribute and must accept 
charity, and of course provision will be made for them.<P>
Two methods of collecting funds from large numbers of our people to 
provide medical services for all have been in operation: namely, taxation 
and insurance. Because tax-supported medical care is usually associated 
with charity, and because the reception of charity is repugnant to most 
Americans, the trend is to develop the needed funds by the insurance 
principle. Radical changes in the insurance programs are necessary if we 
are to extend coverage to that more than 75 per cent of the population 
which for one reason or another does not have medical insurance. Yet only 
a few years ago it was contended by some--especially those in control of 
organized medicine--that prepayment plans to raise money to distribute the 
costs of medical care were unnecessary.<P>
Insurance plans already in existence cover the costs of medical care in 
varying degrees. Some are voluntary, some compulsory; some operate on a 
nonprofit basis, others for profit. Most of them, if properly managed, are 
successful, but unfortunately they include less than a quarter of our 
population, and the benefits in most instances fall far short of complete 
medical care. How shall we extend this insurance program so that it will 
be available to all but the really indigent? And how shall we provide 
comprehensive high-quality medical care, including preventive medical 
procedures, early diagnosis, and treatment for all?<P>
The evidence is conclusive that voluntary prepayment insurance plans will 
not be able to provide medical care for the great majority of our 
citizens. It cannot rescue from medical indigency the great mass of people 
who now frequent our charity or tax-supported clinics. It will not provide 
complete service to the tremendous number of people who for one reason or 
another do not get good medical care today. Its cost is too high. For 
under a voluntary insurance system the rich will stay out and continue to 
receive their medical care as they do today on a fee-for-service basis, 
thus reducing the number of subscribers. Those who gamble on their health 
will also stay out, as will the cultists who believe that disease rests 
upon a theory and that its cure does not depend upon elaborate diagnosis 
and expensive treatment. The omission of these groups will further limit 
the number of subscribers. With the subscribers limited, the rates must be 
raised or the benefits from the funds diminished. The premium rate for 
comprehensive voluntary insurance--profit or nonprofit--is too high for 
the majority of American families.<P>
<BR>
<b>3.</b><P>
The existing voluntary plans controlled by the physicians cover unusual 
emergencies in medicine rather than preventive medical procedures and 
early diagnosis, both of which are so important for the health and welfare 
of the individual. Compulsory insurance, on the other hand, based on a 
percentage of one's income, with certain necessary restrictions, offers 
medical care to its contributors and will include all but the really 
indigent. In the Wagner-Murray
Dingell bill, which was presented to the Seventy-ninth Congress, provision 
was also made to include the really indigent if their local communities, 
which must assume responsibility for them, wish to have them included.<P>
One might still hesitate to urge a program to be financed by compulsory 
prepayment through an extension of the Social Security system, and to be 
administered under its supervision in conjunction with the Surgeon General 
of the Public Health Service, if such a program would in any way lower the 
quality of medical care provided. A study of the proposed legislation, 
however, shows that the quality of medical care would be better 
safeguarded under such a system than it is at present or is likely to be 
under voluntary insurance plans.<P>
Organized medicine has always claimed--and on this point I agree--that two 
important factors that have elevated American medicine to its present high 
position are free choice of physician by the patient and absence of 
interference with the intimate physician-patient relationship. Both of 
these factors, instead of being hindered by a National Health Program, 
will actually be more extensively developed. Through inclusion in the 
program, the families with the smallest incomes, who now go to tax- or 
charity-supported clinics, will be able to choose their own physicians as 
the well-to-do choose them. Furthermore, that ugly reminder of the cost of 
care--namely, the fee--will no longer come between doctor and patient. All 
too often the conscientious physician, in trying to save his patient 
expense, omits a consultation or a test whose value is questionable, only 
to wish eventually that it had not been omitted.<P>
The family physician will continue to play the most important role in 
medical care. It is he who is first consulted on all problems by the 
family, who knows the environmental problems of the family, and who guides 
the individual to the proper specialist. The solo practitioner who tries 
to tackle all the medical problems of an individual is long out-of-date. 
In his place, and after considerable controversy, we have what is known as 
the group practice--that is, the family physician, the pediatrician, and 
the specialist in partnership. This group practice has been increasingly 
successful in providing better service.<P>
In the proposed National Health Program the practicing physician will have 
available all needed laboratory aid and consultations without having the 
question of cost arise. He will be freed from the too frequently justified 
worry that he will lose his patient to the specialist. For the proposed 
National Health Program calls for all subscribers to see to the family 
practitioner or pediatrician first. This point alone will improve the 
quality of medical care because poor results can develop when a patient 
goes directly to a specialist or one who poses as a specialist. All 
medical care for the individual should be guided by a physician who is 
familiar with the patient.<P>
We need more doctors. We need more money for medical education and medical 
research. And while profit insurance companies contribute generously to 
medical research, the records show little if any money allocated to 
medical education and medical research by voluntary nonprofit prepayment 
insurance plans for hospitalization and medical care.<P>
The proposed legislation for a National Health Program provides for 
contributions to expand medical education and to further medical research. 
It also provides:--<P>
1. A family physician for each subscriber, to care for him in the
      office, home, and hospital.<P>
2. Laboratory and hospital facilities for the Physician and the patient. 
<P>
3. Specialists of guaranteed quality as needed--namely, group
      practice.<P>
4. Equal division of control in the administration of the care between 
       qualified laymen (the recipients of the care) and the medical 
       profession.<P>

The term "socialized medicine" has been carelessly tossed about in 
discussions of the Wagner-Murray-Dingell bill. There is nothing in the 
program similar to the type of socialized medicine which exists in Russia. 
If, however, by socialized medicine one means medical care paid for by 
taxation and administered under governmental supervision,--Federal, state, 
or local,--then the beginning of such socialized medicine already exists 
in the United States and has been found satisfactory, if one can judge by 
the fact that it is steadily expanding.

<blockquote>

	

	<font size=5>W</font>E are so used to thinking of spirituality as withdrawal from the world 

and human affairs that it is hard to think of it as political. 

Spirituality is personal and private, we assume, while politics is public. 

But such a dichotomy drastically diminishes spirituality construing it as 

a relationship to God without implications for one's relationship to the 

surrounding world. The God of Christian faith (I shall focus on 

Christianity although the God of the New Testament is also the God of the 

Old Testament) created the world and is deeply engaged in the affairs of 

the world. The notion that we can be related to God and not to the 

world--that we can practice a spirituality that is not political--is in 

conflict with the Christian understanding of God.<P>

And if spirituality is properly political, the converse also is true, 

however distant it may be from prevailing assumptions: politics is 

properly spiritual. The spirituality of politics was affirmed by Plato at 

the very beginnings of Western political philosophy and was a commonplace 

of medieval political thought. Only in modern times has it come to be 

taken for granted that politics is entirely secular. The inevitable result 

is the demoralization of politics. Politics loses its moral structure and 

purpose, and turns into an affair of group interest and personal ambition. 

Government comes to the aid of only the well organized and influential, 

and it is limited only where it is checked by countervailing forces. 

Politics ceases to be understood as a pre-eminently human activity and is 

left to those who find it profitable, pleasurable, or in some other way 

useful to themselves. Political action thus comes to be carried out purely 

for the sake of power and privilege.<P>

It will be my purpose in this essay to try to connect the severed realms 

of the spiritual and the political. In view of the fervent secularism of 

many Americans today, some will assume this to be the opening salvo of a 

fundamentalist attack on "pluralism." Ironically, as I will argue, many of 

the undoubted virtues of pluralism--respect for the individual and a 

belief in the essential equality of all human beings, to cite just 

two--have strong roots in the union of the spiritual and the political 

achieved in the vision of Christianity. The question that secularists have 

to answer is whether these values can survive without these particular 

roots. In short, can we be good without God? Can we affirm the dignity and 

equality of individual persons--values we ordinarily regard as 

secular--without giving them transcendental backing? Today these values 

are honored more in the breach than in the observance; Manhattan Island 

alone, with its extremes of sybaritic wealth on the one hand and Calcuttan 

poverty on the other, is testimony to how little equality really counts 

for in contemporary America. To renew these indispensable values, I shall 

argue, we must rediscover their primal spiritual grounds.<P>

Many will disagree with my argument, and I cannot pretend there are no 

respectable reasons for doing so. Some may disagree, however, because of 

misunderstandings. A few words at the outset may help to prevent this. 

First, although I dwell on Christianity I do not mean thus to slight 

Judaism or its contribution to Western values. It is arguable that every 

major value affirmed in Christianity originated with the ancient Hebrews. 

Jewish sensitivities on this matter are understandable. Christians 

sometimes speak as though unaware of the elemental facts that Jesus was a 

Jew, that he died before even the earliest parts of the New Testament were 

written, and that his scriptural matrix was not Paul's Letter to the 

Romans or the Gospel of John but the Old Testament. Christianity diverged 

from Judaism in answering one question: Who was Jesus? For Christians, he 

was the anticipated Messiah, whereas for traditional Jews (Paul and the 

first Christians were of course also Jews), he was not. This divergence 

has given Christianity its own distinctive character, even though it 

remains in a sense a Jewish faith.<P>

The most adamant opposition to my argument is likely to come from 

protagonists of secular reason--a cause represented preeminently by the 

Enlightenment. Locke and Jefferson, it will be asserted, not Jesus and 

Paul, created our moral universe. Here I cannot be as disarming as I hope 

I was in the paragraph above, for underlying my argument is the conviction 

that Enlightenment rationalism is not nearly so constructive as is often 

supposed. Granted, it has sometimes played a constructive role. It has 

translated certain Christian values into secular terms and, in an age 

becoming increasingly secular, has given them political force. It is 

doubtful, however, that it could have created those values or that it can 

provide them with adequate metaphysical foundations. Hence if Christianity 

declines and dies in coming decades, our moral universe and also the 

relatively humane political universe that it supports will be in peril. 

But I recognize that if secular rationalism is far more dependent on 

Christianity than its protagonists realize, the converse also is in some 

sense true. The Enlightenment carried into action political ideals that 

Christians, in contravention of their own basic faith, often shamefully 

neglected or denied. Further, when I acknowledged that there are 

respectable grounds for disagreeing with my argument, I had secular 

rationalism particularly in mind. The foundations of political decency are 

an issue I wish to raise, not settle.<P>

<B>CHRISTIAN LOVE</B><P>



<font size=5>L</font>OVE seems as distant as spirituality from politics, yet any discussion of 

the political meaning of Christianity must begin by considering (or at 

least making assumptions about) love. Love is for Christians the highest 

standard of human relationships, and therefore governs those relationships 

that make up politics. Not that political relationships are expected to 

exhibit pure love. But their place in the whole structure of human 

relationships can be understood only by using the measure that love 

provides.<P>

The Christian concept of love requires attention not only because it 

underlies Christian political ideas but also because it is unique. Love as 

Christians understand it is distinctly different from what most people 

think of as love. In order to dramatize the Christian faith in an 

incarnate and crucified God, Paul spoke ironically of "the folly of what 

we preach," and it may be said that Christian love is as foolish as 

Christian faith. Marking its uniqueness, Christian love has a distinctive 

name, agape, which sets it apart from other kinds of love, such as philia, 

or friendship, and eros, or erotic passion.<P>

When John wrote that "God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son," 

he illuminated the sacrificial character of divine love. This is the mark 

of agape. It is entirely selfless. If one could love others without 

judging them, asking anything of them, or thinking of one's own needs, one 

would meet the Christian standard. Obviously, no one can. Many of us can 

meet the requirements of friendship or erotic love, but agape is beyond us 

all. It is not a love toward which we are naturally inclined or for which 

we have natural capacities. Yet it is not something exclusively divine, 

like omnipotence, which human beings would be presumptuous to emulate. In 

fact, it is demanded of us. Agape is the core of Christian morality. 

Moreover, as we shall see, it is a source of political standards that are 

widely accepted and even widely, if imperfectly, realized.<P>

The nature of agape stands out sharply against the background of ordinary 

social existence. The life of every society is a harsh process of mutual 

appraisal. People are ceaselessly judged and ranked, and they in turn 

ceaselessly judge and rank others. This is partly a necessity of social 

and political order; no groups whatever--clubs, corporations, 

universities, or nations--can survive without allocating responsibilities 

and powers with a degree of realism. It is partly also a struggle for 

self-esteem; we judge ourselves for the most part as others judge us. 

Hence outer and inner pressures alike impel us to enter the struggle.<P>

The process is harsh because all of us are vulnerable. All of us manifest 

deficiencies of natural endowment--of intelligence, temperament, 

appearance, and so forth. And all personal lives reveal moral deficiencies 

as well--blamable failures in the past, and vanity, greed, and other such 

qualities in the present. The process is harsh also because it is unjust. 

Not only are those who are judged always imperfect and vulnerable, but the 

judges are imperfect too. They are always fallible and often cruel. Thus 

few are rated exactly, or even approximately, as they deserve.<P>

There is no judgment so final nor rank so high that one can finally attain 

security. Many are ranked high; they are regarded as able, or wise, or 

courageous. But such appraisals are never unanimous or stable. A few reach 

summits of power and honor where it seems for a moment that their victory 

is definitive. It transpires, however, that they are more fully exposed to 

judgment than anyone else, and often they have to endure torrents of 

derision.<P>

Agape means refusing to take part in this process. It lifts the one who is 

loved above the level of reality on which a human being can be equated 

with a set of observable characteristics. The agape of God, according to 

Christian faith, does this with redemptive power; God 'crucifies' the 

observable, and always deficient, individual, and "raises up" that 

individual to new life. The agape of human beings bestows new life in turn 

by accepting the work of God. The power of agape extends in two 

directions. Not only is the one who is loved exalted but so is the one who 

loves. To lift someone else above the process of mutual scrutiny is to 

stand above that process oneself. To act on the faith that every human 

being is a beneficiary of the honor that only God can bestow is to place 

oneself in a position to receive that honor. (That is not the aim, of 

course; if it were, agape would be a way of serving oneself and would thus 

be nullified.) Agape raises all those touched by it into the community 

brought by Christ, the Kingdom of God. Everyone is glorified. No one is 

judged and no one judges.<P>

Here we come to the major premise (in the logic of faith, if not 

invariably in the history of Western political philosophy) of all 

Christian social and political thinking--the concept of the exalted 

individual. Arising from agape, this concept more authoritatively than any 

other shapes not only Christian perceptions of social reality but also 

Christian delineations of political goals.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>THE EXALTED INDIVIDUAL</B><P>



<font size=5>T</font>O grasp fully the idea of the exalted individual is not easy, but this is 

not because it rests on a technical or complex theory. The difficulty of 

grasping the concept is due to its being beyond the whole realm of theory. 

It refers to something intrinsically mysterious, a reality that one cannot 

see by having someone else point to it or describe it. It is often spoken 

of, but the words we use--"the dignity of the individual," "the infinite 

value of a human being," and so forth--have become banal and no longer 

evoke the mystery that called them forth. Hence we must try to understand 

what such phrases mean. In what way, from a Christian standpoint, are 

individuals exalted? In trying to answer this question, the concept of 

destiny may provide some help.<P>

In the act of creation God grants a human being glory, or participation in 

the goodness of all that has been created. The glory of a human being, 

however, is not like that of a star or a mountain. It is not objectively 

established but must be freely affirmed by the one to whom it belongs. In 

this sense the glory of a human being is placed in the future. It is not a 

mere possibility however, nor does it seem quite sufficient to say that it 

is a moral norm. It is a fundamental imperative, even though all of us, in 

our sinfulness, to some degree refuse it. This fusion of human freedom and 

divine necessity may be summarily characterized by saying that the glory 

of an individual, rather than being immediately given, is destined.<P>

Destiny is not the same as fate. The word refers not to anything terrible 

or even to anything inevitable, in the usual sense of the word, but to the 

temporal and free unfoldment of a person's essential being. A destiny is a 

spiritual drama.<P>

A destiny is never completely fulfilled in time, in the Christian vision, 

but leads onto the plane of eternity. It must be worked out in time, 

however, and everything that happens to a person in time enters into 

eternal selfhood and is there given meaning and justification. My destiny 

is what has often been referred to as my soul.<P>

Realizing a destiny is not a matter of acquiescing in some form of 

relentless causality. If it were, there would be no sin. A destiny can be 

failed or refused. That is why it is not a fate. True, the very word 

"destiny" is indicative of necessity, but the necessity of a destiny is 

not like the necessity that makes an object fall when it is dropped. 

Rather, it is the kind I recognize when I face a duty I am tempted to 

evade and say to myself, "This I must do." Yet my destiny has a weight 

unlike that of any particular duty, since it is the life given to me by 

God. As is recognized in words like "salvation" and "damnation," the call 

of destiny has a peculiar finality.<P>

The agape of God consists in the bestowal of a destiny, and that of human 

beings in its recognition through faith. Since a destiny is not a matter 

of empirical observation, a person with a destiny is, so to speak, 

invisible. But every person has a destiny. Hence the process of mutual 

scrutiny is in vain, and even the most objective judgments of other people 

are fundamentally false. Agape arises from a realization of this and is 

therefore expressed in a refusal to judge.<P>

The Lord of all time and existence has taken a personal interest in every 

human being, an interest that is compassionate and unwearying. The 

Christian universe is peopled exclusively with royalty. What does this 

mean for society?<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>T</font>O speak cautiously, the concept of the exalted individual implies that 

governments--indeed, all persons who wield power--must treat individuals 

with care. This can mean various things--for example, that individuals are 

to be fed and sheltered when they are destitute, listened to when they 

speak, or merely left alone so long as they do not break the law and 

fairly tried if they do. But however variously care may be defined, it 

always means that human beings are not to be treated like the things we 

use and discard or just leave lying about. They deserve attention. This 

spare standard has of course been frequently and grossly violated by 

people who call themselves Christians. It has not been without force, 

however. Even in our own secularized times people who are useless or 

burdensome, hopelessly ill or guilty of terrible crimes, are sometimes 

treated with extraordinary consideration and patience.<P>

The modest standard of care implies other, more demanding standards. 

Equality is one of these; no one is to be casually sacrificed. No natural, 

social, or even moral differences justify exceptions to this rule. Of 

course destinies make people not equal but, rather, incomparable; equality 

is a measurement and dignity is immeasurable. But according to Christian 

claims, every person has been immeasurably dignified. Faith discerns no 

grounds for making distinctions, and the distinctions made by custom and 

ambition are precarious before God. "Many that are first will be last, and 

the last first." Not only love but humility as well--the humility of not 

anticipating the judgments of God--impels us toward the standard of 

equality.<P>

No one, then, belongs at the bottom, enslaved, irremediably poor, 

consigned to silence; this is equality. This points to another standard: 

that no one should be left outside, an alien and a barbarian. Agape 

implies universality. Greeks and Hebrews in ancient times were often 

candidly contemptuous of most of the human race. Even Jesus, although not 

contemptuous of Gentiles, conceived of his mission as primarily to Israel. 

However, Jesus no doubt saw the saving of Israel as the saving of all 

humankind, and his implicit universalism became explicit, and decisive for 

the history of the world, in the writings and missionary activity of Paul. 

Christian universalism (as well as Christian egalitarianism) was 

powerfully expressed by Paul when he wrote that "there is neither Jew nor 

Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; 

for you are all one in Christ Jesus."<P>

Christian universalism was reinforced by the universalism of the later 

Stoics, who created the ideal of an all-embracing city of reason--

cosmopolis. Medieval Christians couched their universalist outlook in 

Hellenic terms. Thus two streams of thought, from Israel and Greece, 

flowed together. As a result the world today, although divided among 

nations often ferociously self-righteous and jealous, is haunted by the 

vision of a global community. War and national rivalry seem unavoidable, 

but they burden the human conscience. Searing poverty prevails in much of 

the world, as it always has, but no longer is it unthinkingly accepted in 

either the rich nations or the poor. There is a shadowy but widespread 

awareness, which Christianity has had much to do with creating, that one 

person cannot be indifferent to the destiny of another person anywhere on 

earth. It is hardly too much to say that the idea of the exalted 

individual is the spiritual center of Western politics. Although this idea 

is often forgotten and betrayed, were it erased from our minds our 

politics would probably become altogether what it is at present only in 

part--an affair of expediency and self-interest.<P>

The exalted individual is not an exclusively Christian principle. There 

are two ways in which, without making any religious assumptions, we may 

sense the infinite worth of an individual. One way is love. Through 

personal love, or through the sympathy by which personal love is extended 

(although at the same time weakened), we sense the measureless worth of a 

few, and are able to surmise that what we sense in a few may be present in 

all. In short, to love some (it is, as Dostoevsky suggested, humanly 

impossible to love everyone) may give rise to the idea that all are worthy 

of love. Further, the idea of the exalted individual may become a secular 

value through reason, as it did for the Stoics. Reason tells me that each 

person is one and not more than one. Hence my claims upon others are 

rightfully matched by their claims upon me. Simple fairness, which even a 

child can understand, is implicitly egalitarian and universal; and it is 

reasonable.<P>

Can love and reason, though, undergird our politics if faith suffers a 

further decline? That is doubtful. Love and reason are suggestive, but 

they lack definite political implications. Greeks of the Periclean Age, 

living at the summit of the most brilliant period of Western civilization, 

showed little consciousness of the notion that every individual bears an 

indefeasible and incomparable dignity. Today why should those who assume 

that God is dead entertain such a notion? This question is particularly 

compelling in view of a human characteristic very unlike exaltation.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>THE FALLEN INDIVIDUAL</B><P>



<font size=5>T</font>HE fallen individual is not someone other than the exalted individual. 

Every human being is fallen and exalted both. This paradox is familiar to 

all informed Christians. Yet it is continually forgotten--partly, perhaps, 

because it so greatly complicates the task of dealing with evil in the 

world, and no doubt partly because we hate to apply it to ourselves; 

although glad to recall our exaltation, we are reluctant to remember our 

fallenness. It is vital to political understanding, however, to do both. 

If the concept of the exalted individual defines the highest value under 

God, the concept of the fallen individual defines the situation in which 

that value must be sought and defended.<P>

The principle that a human being is sacred yet morally degraded is hard 

for common sense to grasp. It is apparent to most of us that some people 

are morally degraded. It is ordinarily assumed, however, that other people 

are morally upright and that these alone possess dignity. From this point 

of view all is simple and logical. The human race is divided roughly 

between good people, who possess the infinite worth we attribute to 

individuals, and bad people, who do not. The basic problem of life is for 

the good people to gain supremacy over, and perhaps eradicate, the bad 

people. This view appears in varied forms: in Marxism, where the human 

race is divided between a world-redeeming class and a class that is 

exploitative and condemned; in some expressions of American nationalism, 

where the division--at least, until recently--has been between "the free 

world" and demonic communism; in Western films, where virtuous heroes kill 

bandits and lawless Indians.<P>

This common model of life's meaning is drastically irreligious, because it 

places reliance on good human beings and not on God. It has no room for 

the double insight that the evil are not beyond the reach of divine mercy 

nor the good beyond the need for it. It is thus antithetical to 

Christianity which maintains that human beings are justified by God alone, 

and that all are sacred and none are good.<P>

The proposition that none are good does not mean merely that none are 

perfect. It means that all are persistently and deeply inclined toward 

evil. All are sinful. In a few sin is so effectively suppressed that it 

seems to have been destroyed. But this is owing to God's grace, Christian 

principles imply, not to human goodness, and those in whom it has happened 

testify emphatically that this is so. Saints claim little credit for 

themselves.<P>

Nothing in Christian doctrine so offends people today as the stress on 

sin. It is morbid and self-destructive, supposedly, to depreciate 

ourselves in this way. Yet the Christian view is not implausible. The 

twentieth century not to speak of earlier ages (often assumed to be more 

barbaric), has displayed human evil in extravagant forms. Wars and 

massacres, systematic torture and internment in concentration camps, have 

become everyday occurrences in the decades since 1914. Even in the most 

civilized societies subtle forms of callousness and cruelty prevail 

through capitalist and bureaucratic institutions. Thus our own experience 

indicates that we should not casually dismiss the Christian concept of 

sin.<P>

According to that concept, the inclination toward evil is primarily an 

inclination to exalt ourselves rather than allowing ourselves to be 

exalted by God. We exalt ourselves in a variety of ways: for example, by 

power, trying to control all the things and people around us; by greed, 

accumulating an inequitable portion of the material goods of the world; by 

self-righteousness, claiming to be wholly virtuous; and so forth. Self

exaltation is carried out sometimes by individuals, sometimes by groups. 

It is often referred to, in all of its various forms, as "pride."<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>T</font>HE Christian concept of sin is not adequately described, however, merely 

by saying that people frequently engage in evil actions. Our 

predisposition toward such actions is so powerful and so unyielding that 

it holds us captive. As Paul said, "I do not do what I want, but I do the 

very thing I hate." This does not imply, of course, that I am entirely 

depraved. If I disapprove of my evil acts, then I am partly good. However, 

if I persist in evil in the face of my own disapproval, then I am not only 

partly evil but also incapable of destroying the evil in my nature and 

enthroning the good. I am, that is to say, a prisoner of evil, even if I 

am not wholly evil. This imprisonment is sometimes called "original sin," 

and the phrase is useful, not because one must take the story of Adam's 

disobedience literally but because it points to the mysterious truth that 

our captivity by evil originates in a primal and iniquitous choice on the 

part of every person. I persistently fail to attain goodness because I 

have turned away from goodness and set my face toward evil.<P>

The political value of the doctrine of original sin lies in its 

recognition that our evil tendencies are not in the nature of a problem 

that we can rationally comprehend and deliberately solve. To say that the 

source of sin is sin is to say that sin is underivable and inexplicable. A 

sinful society is not like a malfunctioning machine, something to be 

checked and quickly repaired.<P>

Sin is ironic. Its intention is self-exaltation, its result is self

debasement. In trying to ascend, we fall. The reason for this is not hard 

to understand. We are exalted by God; in declaring our independence from 

God, we cast ourselves down. In other words, sin concerns not just our 

actions and our nature but also the setting of our lives. By sin we cast 

ourselves into a degraded sphere of existence, a sphere Christians often 

call "the world." Human beings belong to the world through sin. They look 

at one another as objects; they manipulate, mutilate, and kill one 

another. In diverse ways, some subtle and some shocking, some relatively 

innocuous and some devastating, they continually depersonalize themselves 

and others. They behave as inhabitants of the world they have sinfully 

formed rather than of the earth created by God. Original sin is the quiet 

determination, deep in everyone, to stay inside the world. Every sinful 

act is a violation of the personal being that continually, in freedom, 

vision, and love, threatens the world. The archetype of sin is the 

reduction of a person to the thing we call a corpse.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>THE MAN-GOD VERSUS THE GOD-MAN</B><P>



<font size=5>W</font>HEN the paradox of simultaneous exaltation and fallenness collapses, it 

is replaced by either cynicism or (to use a term that is accurate but 

masks the destructive character of the attitude it refers to) idealism.<P>

Cynicism measures the value of human beings by their manifest qualities 

and thus esteems them very slightly. It concludes, in effect, that 

individuals are not exalted, because they are fallen. Idealism refuses 

this conclusion. It insists that the value of human beings, or of some of 

them, is very great. It is not so simplistic, however, as to deny the 

incongruity of their essential value and their manifest qualities. Rather, 

it asserts that this incongruity can be resolved by human beings on their 

own, perhaps through political revolution or psychotherapy. Human beings 

can exalt themselves.<P>

We shall dwell in this discussion on idealism, partly because idealism is 

much more tempting and therefore much more common than cynicism. Idealism 

is exhilarating, whereas cynicism, as anything more than a youthful 

experiment, is grim and discouraging. We shall dwell on idealism also 

because it is so much more dangerous than it looks. The dangers of 

cynicism are evident; that a general contempt for human beings is apt to 

be socially and politically destructive scarcely needs to be argued. But 

idealism looks benign. It is important to understand why its appearance is 

misleading.<P>

Idealism in our time is commonly a form of collective pride. Human beings 

exalt themselves by exalting a group. Each one of course exalts the 

singular and separate self in some manner. In most people, however, 

personal pride needs reinforcement through a common ideal or emotion, such 

as nationalism. Hence the rise of collective pride. To exalt ourselves, we 

exalt a nation, a class, or even the whole of humanity in some particular 

manifestation like science. Such pride is alluring. It assumes grandiose 

and enthralling proportions yet it seems selfless, because not one person 

alone but a class or nation or some other collectivity is exalted. It can 

be at once more extreme and less offensive than personal pride.<P>

To represent the uncompromising and worldly character of modern idealism 

we may appropriately use the image of the man-god. This image is a 

reversal of the Christian concept of the God-man, Christ. The order of the 

terms obviously is crucial. In the case of the God-man, it indicates the 

source of Christ's divinity as understood in Christian faith. God took the 

initiative. To reverse the order of the terms and affirm the man-god is to 

say that human beings become divine on their own initiative. Here pride 

reaches its most extreme development. The dignity bestowed on human beings 

by God, in Christian faith, is now claimed as a quality that human beings 

can acquire through their own self-creating acts.<P>

In using the concept of the man-god, I do not mean to suggest that 

divinity is explicitly attributed to certain human beings. Even 

propagandists, to say nothing of philosophers, are more subtle than that. 

What happens is simply that qualities traditionally attributed to God are 

shifted to a human group or type. The qualities thus assigned are 

various--perfect understanding, perhaps, or unfailing fairness. 

Illustrative are the views of three great intellectual figures, familiar 

to everyone, yet so diversely interpreted that the fundamental character 

of their thought--and their deep similarity--is sometimes forgotten.<P>

Friedrich Nietzsche set forth the ideal of the man-god more literally and 

dramatically than any other writer. Nietzsche's thinking was grounded in a 

bitter repudiation of Christianity, and he devoted much of his life to 

scouring human consciousness in order to cleanse it of every Christian 

idea and emotion. In this way his philosophy became a comprehensive 

critique of Western civilization, as well as a foreshadowing of an 

alternative civilization. It is, as practically everyone now recognizes, 

remarkable in its range, subtlety, and complexity; Nietzsche is not easily 

classified or epitomized. It can nevertheless be argued that the dramatic 

center of his lifework lay in the effort to overthrow the standard of 

Christian love and to wipe out the idea that every human being deserves 

respect--leading Nietzsche to attack such norms in the field of politics 

as equality and democracy. If Christian faith is spurned, Nietzsche held, 

with the courage that was one of the sources of his philosophical 

greatness, then Christian morality must also be spurned. Agape has no 

rightful claim on our allegiance. And not only does agape lack all moral 

authority but it has a destructive effect on society and culture. It 

inhibits the rise of superior human beings to the heights of glory, which, 

we realize at last, are not inhabited by God. By exalting the common 

person, who is entirely lacking in visible distinction and glory, agape 

subverts the true order of civilization. The divine quality that Nietzsche 

claimed for humanity was power--the power not only of great political 

leaders like Julius Caesar and Napoleon but also of philosophers, writers, 

and artists, who impose intricate and original forms of order on chaotic 

material. Such power, in the nature of things, can belong only to a few. 

These few are human gods. Their intrinsic splendor overcomes the absurdity 

that erupted with the death of the Christian God, and justifies human 

existence.<P>

Karl Marx is perhaps not only as well known among Christian intellectuals 

as even the most celebrated theologians but also as influential. The 

familiar saying "We are all Marxists now" dramatizes the fact that Marx's 

views on such matters as class and capitalism are part of the furniture of 

the modern mind. Christian writers are not exceptions; spontaneously they 

think in some measure in Marxist terms. A considerable number of them can 

even be called Marxist Christians--an appellation fully justified in the 

case of most liberation theologians. Marx has in that sense become a 

familiar member of the Christian household. When he is thus domesticated, 

however, we tend to forget what he really thought. We may forget that he 

was as apocalyptically secular and humanistic as Nietzsche, even though he 

disdained the kind of elevated and poetic rhetoric that abounds in 

Nietzsche's writings. He called for the entire transformation of human 

life by human beings, and this, in Marx's mind, included the 

transformation of nature. The universe was to become radically--in its 

roots, in its sources and standards--human. True, like the Christians he 

scorned, and unlike Nietzsche, Marx was egalitarian. The transformation of 

humanity and being was envisioned as the work of multitudes, the 

proletariat, and not of exceptional individuals, and ahead lay justice and 

community rather than glorious solitude, as in Nietzsche. Nevertheless, 

Marx tacitly claimed for the proletariat qualities much like those 

attributed in the Old Testament to God--omniscience, righteousness, and 

historical sovereignty, all devoted to avenging past wrongs and 

transfiguring human existence.<P>

Sigmund Freud, of course, avoided both the rhetoric of redemption and the 

thought; he regarded any great change in the character of human beings or 

the conditions of human life as unlikely, and by intention was a 

scientist, not a prophet or a revolutionary. He belongs among the heralds 

of the man

god, however, because of the conviction that underlay all his 

psychological investigations. Disorders of the soul, which for Christians 

derive in one way or another from sin, and hence in their ultimate origins 

are mysterious, Freud believed to be scientifically explicable. From this 

conviction it followed that the healing work Christians believe to be 

dependent on divine grace Freud could assign altogether to human therapy. 

The soul was thus severed from God (for Freud a childish illusion) and 

placed in the province of human understanding and action. Not that 

psychoanalysis and Christianity are in all ways mutually exclusive; the 

many Christians who have learned from Freud testify to the contrary. But 

for Freud and his major followers, psychoanalysis is a comprehensive 

faith, not merely a set of useful hypotheses and techniques. As a faith, 

it attributes to humanity alone powers and responsibilities that 

Christians regard as divine. Human beings are exalted by virtue of purely 

human faculties. Freud's attitude of resignation was a matter mainly of 

temperament; his methods, theories, and basic assumptions have reinforced 

the efforts of human beings to seize the universal sovereignty that 

Christians assign exclusively to God.<P>

Nietzsche, Marx, and Freud represent a movement by no means restricted to 

those who consciously follow any one of them or even to those familiar 

with their writings. Not only are we "all Marxists now"; it could be said 

with nearly equal justification that we are all Nietzscheans and 

Freudians. Most of us have come to assume that we ourselves are the 

authors of human destiny. The term "man-god" may seem extreme, but I 

believe that our situation is extreme. Christianity poses sweeping 

alternatives--destiny and fate, redemption and eternal loss, the Kingdom 

of God and the void of Hell. From centuries of Christian culture and 

education we have come habitually to think of life as structured by such 

extremes. Hence Christian faith may fade, but we still want to live a 

destiny rather than a mere life, to transform the conditions of human 

existence and not merely to effect improvements, to establish a perfect 

community and not simply a better society. Losing faith in the God-man, we 

inevitably begin to dream of the man-god, even though we often think of 

the object of our new faith as something impersonal and innocuous, like 

science, thus concealing from ourselves the radical nature of our 

dreams.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>POLITICAL IDOLATRY</B><P>



<font size=5>T</font>HE political repercussions are profound. Most important is that all 

logical grounds for attributing an ultimate and immeasurable dignity to 

every person, regardless of outward character, disappear. Some people may 

gain dignity from their achievements in art, literature, or politics, but 

the notion that all people without exception--the most base, the most 

destructive, the most repellent--have equal claims on our respect becomes 

as absurd as would be the claim that all automobiles or all horses are of 

equal excellence. The standard of agape collapses. It becomes explicable 

only on Nietzsche's terms: as a device by which the weak and failing exact 

from the strong and distinguished a deference they do not deserve. Thus 

the spiritual center of Western politics fades and vanishes. If the 

principle of personal dignity disappears, the kind of political order we 

are used to--one structured by standards such as liberty for all human 

beings and equality under the law--becomes indefensible.<P>

Nietzsche's stature is owing to the courage and profundity that enabled 

him to make this all unmistakably clear. He delineated with overpowering 

eloquence the consequences of giving up Christianity and every like view 

of the universe and humanity. His approval of those consequences and his 

hatred of Christianity give force to his argument. Many would like to 

think that there are no consequences--that we can continue treasuring the 

life and welfare, the civil rights and political authority, of every 

person without believing in a God who renders such attitudes and conduct 

compelling. Nietzsche shows that we cannot. We cannot give up the 

Christian God--and the transcendence given other names in other faiths-

and go on as before. We must give up Christian morality too. If the God

man is nothing more than an illusion, the same thing is true of the idea 

that every individual possesses incalculable worth.<P>

It is true, as we have seen, that love and reason provide intimations of 

such worth--but intimations alone; they provide little basis for 

overruling the conclusions of our senses. The denial of the God-man and of 

God's merciful love of sinful humanity is a denial of destiny, and without 

destiny there is simply life. But life calls forth respect only in 

proportion to its intensity and quality. Except in the case of infants and 

children, we ordinarily look on those lacking in purposeful vitality with 

pity or disgust. Respect we spontaneously reserve for the strong and 

creative. If it is life we prize, then institutions that protect and care 

for people whose lives are faltering are worse than senseless. It is hard 

to think of anyone else, with the single exception of Dostoevsky, who has 

understood all of this as profoundly as did Nietzsche.<P>

Marx certainly did not. His mind was on matters of a different kind, 

matters less philosophical. The result was an illogical humanitarianism. 

Marx was incensed by the squalor in which the common people of his time 

were forced to live and by the harsh conditions and endless hours of their 

work. Marx sympathized deeply with the downtrodden and disinherited. But 

this expressed his personal qualities, not his philosophy or faith. His 

philosophy was a materialism that can be interpreted in differing ways but 

that implied, at the very least, that reality was not created by and is 

not governed by God; his faith was in science and human will. He provided 

no philosophical or religious grounds whatever for the idea that every 

person must be treated with care. In spite of Marx's humanitarianism, 

therefore, there is a link between Marxist thought and the despotic 

regimes that have ruled in his name. It is perfectly true, as his 

defenders aver, that Marx adhered to political principles quite unlike 

those manifest in the purges and prison camps of the Soviet Union. That 

such practices should claim the authority of his name is thus outrageous 

in a sense. Nonetheless, the connection between Marx himself and modern 

Marxist despots is not entirely accidental. They share the principle that 

a single individual does not necessarily matter.<P>

If the denial of the God-man has destructive logical implications, it also 

has dangerous emotional consequences. Dostoevsky wrote that a person 

"cannot live without worshipping something." Anyone who denies God must 

worship an idol--which is not necessarily a wooden or metal figure. In our 

time we have seen ideologies, groups, and leaders receive divine honors. 

People proud of their critical and discerning spirit have rejected Christ 

and bowed down before Hitler, Stalin, Mao, or some other secular savior.<P>

When disrespect for individuals is combined with political idolatry, the 

results can be atrocious. Both the logical and the emotional foundations 

of political decency are destroyed. Equality becomes nonsensical and 

breaks down under attack from one or another human god. Consider Lenin: as 

a Marxist, and like Marx an exponent of equality, under the pressures of 

revolution he denied equality in principle--except as an ultimate goal-

and so systematically nullified it in practice as to become the founder of 

modern totalitarianism. When equality falls, universality is likely also 

to fall. Nationalism or some other form of collective pride becomes 

virulent, and war unrestrained. Liberty, too, is likely to vanish; it 

becomes a heavy personal and social burden when no God justifies and 

sanctifies the individual in spite of all personal deficiencies and 

failures.<P>

The idealism of the man-god does not, of course, bring as an immediate and 

obvious consequence a collapse into unrestrained nihilism. We all know 

many people who do not believe in God and yet are decent and admirable. 

Western societies, as highly secularized as they are, retain many humane 

features. Not even tacitly has our sole governing maxim become the one 

Dostoevsky thought was bound to follow the denial of the God-man: 

"Everything is permitted."<P>

This may be, however, because customs and habits formed during Christian 

ages keep people from professing and acting on such a maxim even though it 

would be logical for them to do so. If that is the case, our position is 

precarious, for good customs and habits need spiritual grounds, and if 

those are lacking, they will gradually, or perhaps suddenly in some 

crisis, crumble.<P>

To what extent are we now living on moral savings accumulated over many 

centuries but no longer being replenished? To what extent are those 

savings already severely depleted? Again and again we are told by 

advertisers, counselors, and other purveyors of popular wisdom that we 

have a right to buy the things we want and to live as we please. We should 

be prudent and farsighted, perhaps (although even those modest virtues are 

not greatly emphasized), but we are subject ultimately to no standard but 

self-interest. If nihilism is most obvious in the lives of wanton 

destroyers like Hitler, it is nevertheless present also in the lives of 

people who live purely as pleasure and convenience dictate.<P>

And aside from intentions, there is a question concerning consequences. 

Even idealists whose good intentions for the human race are pure and 

strong are still vulnerable to fate because of the pride that causes them 

to act ambitiously and recklessly in history. Initiating chains of 

unforeseen and destructive consequences, they are often overwhelmed by 

results drastically at variance with their humane intentions. Modern 

revolutionaries have willed liberty and equality for everyone, not the 

terror and despotism they have actually created. Social reformers in the 

United States were never aiming at the great federal bureaucracy or at the 

pervasive dedication to entertainment and pleasure that characterizes the 

welfare state they brought into existence. There must always be a gap 

between intentions and results, but for those who forget that they are 

finite and morally flawed the gap may become a chasm. Not only Christians 

but almost everyone today feels the fear that we live under the sway of 

forces that we have set in motion--perhaps in the very process of 

industrialization, perhaps only at certain stages of that process, as in 

the creation of nuclear power--and that threaten our lives and are beyond 

our control.<P>

There is much room for argument about these matters. But there is no 

greater error in the modern mind than the assumption that the God-man can 

be repudiated with impunity. The man-god may take his place and become the 

author of deeds wholly unintended and the victim of terrors starkly in 

contrast with the benign intentions lying at their source. The irony of 

sin is in this way reproduced in the irony of idealism: exalting human 

beings in their supposed virtues and powers, idealism undermines them. 

Exciting fervent expectations, it leads toward despair.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>IDEOLOGY AND AMBIGUITY</B><P>



<font size=5>P</font>RACTICALLY everyone today agrees that "being good," in a political sense, 

depends on recognizing the measureless worth of the human being. When this 

recognition is translated into ideological terms such as liberalism and 

conservatism, however agreement vanishes. The main moral assumption 

underlying the discussion above becomes controversial. Nevertheless, we 

have to ask what the ideological implications of Christianity are, for 

this is simply to inquire about the practical meaning of the ideas that we 

have been discussing and thus to carry the argument to its logical 

conclusion.<P>

In asking about ideology, however, we immediately encounter something that 

seemingly undermines any ideological commitment. This is an implicit 

political ambiguity. This ambiguity is deeply rooted in Christian 

principles, and must at the outset be taken into account.<P>

In the Christian view, while every individual is exalted, society is not. 

On the contrary every society is placed in question, for a society is a 

mere worldly order and a mere human creation and can never do justice to 

the glory of the human beings within it. The exaltation of the individual 

reveals the baseness of society. It follows that our political obligations 

are indeterminate and equivocal. If we recognize what God has done--so 

Christian principles imply--we shall be limitlessly respectful of human 

beings but wary of society. Yet human beings live in society, and we meet 

them there or not at all. Hence we cannot stand wholly apart from society 

without failing in our responsibilities to the human beings whom God has 

exalted. So far as we are responsive to God, we must live within human 

kingdoms as creatures destined to be fellow citizens in God's Kingdom. 

This obligation gives rise to a political stance that is ambiguous and, in 

a world of devastatingly unambiguous ideologies, unique: humane and 

engaged, but also hesitant and critical.<P>

Christianity implies skepticism concerning political ideals and plans. For 

Christianity to be wedded indissolubly to any of them (as it often has 

been, "Christian socialism" and Christian celebrations of "the spirit of 

democratic capitalism" being examples) is idolatrous and thus subversive 

of Christian faith.<P>

Trying to take into account both the profound evil in human nature and the 

immense hope in the human situation, as Christians must, leads inevitably 

to what reformers and radicals--particularly those of the Third World, 

surrounded as they are by impoverished multitudes--are apt to regard as 

fatal equivocations. It leads, as I have already indicated, to a critical 

spirit and to qualified commitments. It would be easy to charge that such 

a posture reflects the self-interest and complacency of those who do not 

suffer from the injustice characterizing existing structures. 

Equivocation, it may be said, is one of the luxuries of bourgeois life in 

the industrial world.<P>

Still, a Christian in the United States, without being particularly 

discerning or morally sensitive, can see at least two things not so 

clearly visible to Third World Christian writers, particularly those 

liberation theologians who long for immediate social transformation. One 

of these is the universal disaster of revolution. There is perhaps not a 

single example in our time of a determined effort to produce swift and 

sweeping change which has not ended in tyranny; such efforts have often 

also ended in abominations, such as those witnessed in recent times in 

Cambodia, incalculably worse than those perpetrated by the old social 

order.<P>

The second thing a Christian in a prosperous industrial nation can see is 

visible because it is near at hand: that life can be culturally vulgar, 

morally degraded, and spiritually vacuous even under conditions of 

substantial justice. Not that justice has been fully achieved in the 

United States. But it has been approximated closely enough for us to begin 

to gauge its significance. We can begin to see that justice does not 

necessarily mean an entirely good society. The great masses of people in 

the United States enjoy historically unprecedented prosperity, in stark 

contrast with conditions in the Third World. Accompanying this prosperity, 

however, are signs--too numerous and flagrant to need mentioning--of moral 

cynicism, spiritual frivolity, and despair. If revolutions make plain the 

power of sin--its ability to captivate idealistic reformers--mass society 

displays the ingenuity of sin. Human beings in their passion for justice 

have not devised institutions that they cannot in their pride and 

selfishness outwit.<P>

It may seem that the ideological meaning of Christianity is becoming 

clear: Christianity is solidly, if covertly, on the side of the status 

quo. It is conservative. There are good reasons for arguing, however, that 

Christianity cannot logically be conservative but is rather--in its own 

distinctive fashion--radical. <P>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>A HESITANT RADICALISM</B><P>



<font size=5>T</font>HE Christian record in the annals of reform, it must be granted, is not 

impressive. Christians have accepted, and sometimes actively supported, 

slavery, poverty and almost every other common social evil. They have 

often condemned such evils in principle but failed to oppose them in 

practice. Faith does not necessarily conquer selfishness and is 

particularly unlikely to do so when connected with an established religion 

and thus with privileged groups. That Christianity has in various times 

and places, and in various ways, been an established religion is perhaps 

the major reason why it has been implicated in injustices such as slavery, 

serfdom, and the oppressive wage labor of early capitalism.<P>

Nevertheless, Christianity in essence is not conservative. The notion that 

it is (the historical record aside) probably stems mainly from the fact 

that Christians share with conservatives a consciousness of the 

fallibility of human beings. The two camps occupy common anthropological 

ground. But the consciousness of human fallibility is far keener among 

Christians than among conservatives, for Christians are skeptical of human 

arrangements that typically command deep respect in conservatives. Thus, 

Christians cannot logically assume that the antiquity of institutions 

provides any assurance of their justice or efficacy. They realize, if they 

consult Christian principles, that long-standing customs and traditions 

embody not only the wisdom of generations but also the wickedness--in 

particular, the determination of dominant groups to preserve their powers 

and privileges.<P>

Christians are also mistrustful of aristocracies and elites. Conservatives 

typically commend the rule of long-ascendant minorities, those certified 

by the established order as wise and noble. But Paul, addressing early 

Christians in Corinth, noted that "not many of you were wise according to 

worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth." 

New Testament passages indicate that Christ had a special concern for the 

despised and disinherited, the ignorant and unsophisticated. "God chose 

what is foolish in the world to shame the wise." The attitude expressed in 

such a passage is remote from the topical conservative reverence for 

minorities of inherited rank and traditional learning.<P>

Conservatives (like non-Christian radicals) commonly assume that sin can 

be circumvented by human skill. In the conservative view, allowing only 

those institutional changes that are gradual and protracted, and according 

authority to traditional elites, will accomplish this. For Christians, sin 

is circumvented only by grace. It is certainly not circumvented by 

society, the form that sinful men and women give to the fallen world.<P>

In America conservatives believe that sin is effectively redirected to the 

common good through the market. The alchemy of capitalist competition 

transmutes sin into virtue. But it is difficult to see how any Christian 

who fully grasps Christian principles can be an unqualified supporter of 

capitalism. Insofar as the market governs social relations, people are 

forced into acquisitive rivalry; to count in any way on a gift of "daily 

bread" rather than on money in the bank would be the mark of a fool. 

Acquisitive success is candidly equated with virtue and personal worth 

naively measured in material terms. Charity is often bestowed on the needy 

but it is a matter of personal generosity, not of justice or community; 

and it is unsanctioned in capitalist theory. No principles could be more 

thoroughly anticommunal than those of capitalism. Indeed, capitalism is 

probably more anticommunal in theory than in practice, for human beings 

cannot be as consistently selfish and calculating as capitalist doctrine 

calls on them to be. Capitalism has one bond with Christianity--the 

premise that human beings are ordinarily selfish. A system that enables an 

industrial society to achieve a degree of order and efficiency without 

depending on either human goodness or governmental coercion cannot be 

entirely despised. Nevertheless, even if capitalism worked as well as its 

supporters claim, it would by Christian standards fail morally and 

spiritually.<P>

But if Christians are more pessimistic about human beings and about social 

devices like the market than are conservatives, how can they act on the 

side of serious social change? How can they do anything but cling to all 

institutions, however unjust, that counteract the chaotic potentialities 

of human beings and achieve some sort of order? There are three answers to 

these questions.<P>

First of all, Christian ideas place one in a radical--that is, critical 

and adverse--relationship to established institutions. The Kingdom of God 

is a judgment on existing society and a symbol of its impermanence. Jesus 

was crucified because his presence and preaching were profoundly 

unsettling to reigning religious and political groups. Jesus did not seek 

the violent overthrow of these groups, but neither did he show much 

concern for their stability.<P>

Further, these attitudes have to be acted on. This is a matter of 

spiritual integrity. To anticipate the coming of the Kingdom of God is 

merely sentimental, a private frivolity, unless one tries to reshape 

society according to the form of the imminent community, a form defined by 

equality and universality and requiring particular attention to the 

disinherited and oppressed.<P>

Finally, however, to take it for granted that all attempted reforms will 

fail would be as presumptuous as to assume that they will succeed. It is 

not only sinful human beings who are at work in history. Christians 

believe, but God as well. Agape is not merely a standard of personal 

conduct, powerless over events. In exalting individuals, it discloses the 

inner meaning of history. To practice love is to be allied with the 

deepest currents of life. From a Christian standpoint, a frightened 

refusal of all social change would be highly inappropriate.<P>

Clearly the immediate political aims of Christians are not necessarily 

different from those of secular radicals and reformers. Their underlying 

attitudes are different, however. The Christian sense of the depth and 

stubbornness of evil in human beings, along with the faith that the 

universe under the impetus of grace is moving toward radical re-creation, 

gives a distinctive cast to the Christian conception of political action 

and social progress.<P>

Secular conceptions of reform are apt to be characterized by optimistic 

oversimplifications and distortions. American reformers. for example, 

typically assume that human beings are both reasonable and just and that 

beneficent social change is therefore easy. The main thing necessary, 

after identifying a problem, is to devise and propagate a rational 

solution. Poverty, crime, class conflict, war, and all other great social 

evils can gradually but surely be eliminated. Good will and intelligence, 

well organized and fully informed (through the studies of social 

scientists), will suffice. Such illusions stem from a dilemma noted above. 

It is difficult for secular reformers to reconcile their sense of the 

dignity of individuals with a recognition of the selfishness and 

perversity of individuals. They are thus led persistently to exaggerate 

human goodness. Trying to match their view of human nature with their 

belief in human dignity, they fail to see how human beings actually behave 

or to understand the difficulties and complexities of reform.<P>

Tocqueville suggested approvingly that Christianity tends to make a people 

"circumspect and undecided." with "its impulses...checked and its works 

unfinished." This expresses well the spirit of reform inherent in 

Christian faith. Christianity is radical, but it is also hesitant. This is 

partly, of course, because Christianity restrains our self-assurance. 

Efforts at social transformation must always encounter unforeseen 

complexities, difficulties, limits, and tragedies. Caution is in order. 

But Christian hesitancy has deeper grounds than prudence and more 

compelling motives than wariness of practical blunders. Hesitation 

expresses a consciousness of the mystery of being and the dignity of every 

person. It provides a moment for consulting destiny. Recent decades have 

seen heroic political commitments in behalf of social reform, but 

hesitation has been evident mainly in the service of self-interest. 

Christian faith, however, suggests that hesitation should have a part in 

our most conscientious deeds. It is a formality that is fitting when we 

cross the frontier between meditation and action. And like all significant 

formalities, it is a mark of respect--for God and for the creatures with 

whom we share the earth.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>S</font>OME will dislike the implication that "being good" consists in being 

radical; others will think it strange to link radicalism with hesitation 

or religious faith. I suggest, however, that the main task facing 

political goodness in our time is that of maintaining responsible hope. 

Responsible hope is hesitant because it is cognizant of the discouraging 

actualities of collective life; it is radical because it measures those 

actualities against the highest standards of imagination and faith. 

Whether so paradoxical a stance can be sustained without transcendental 

connections--without God--is doubtful.<P>

We live in a disheartening century--"the worst so far," as someone has 

said. There have never before been wars so destructive as the series of 

conflicts that erupted in 1914; never have tyrannies been so frenzied and 

all-consuming as those established by Nazism and communism. All great 

political causes have failed. Socialism has eventuated in the rule either 

of privileged ideological bureaucrats or of comfortable, listless masses; 

liberal reform in America has at least for a time passed away, leaving 

stubborn injustices and widespread cynicism; conservatism has come to 

stand for an illogical combination of market economics and truculent 

nationalism. Most of the human race lives in crushing poverty, and the 

privileged minority in societies where industrial abundance undergirds a 

preoccupation with material comfort and an atmosphere of spiritual 

inanity.<P>

It is not just that hope itself is difficult to maintain in our situation. 

One is forced, so to speak, to hope alone. After all that has happened, in 

what party or cause or movement can one find a hope that can be 

unreservedly shared? Inherent in the disheartenment of our century is the 

impossibility of believing any longer in political commitment. And to draw 

back from commitment is to face political solitude. The individual must 

find a way of standing for authentic values with little or no human 

support. A radicalism that is hesitant must also be solitary.<P>

If the great causes and movements all have failed, and unqualified 

political commitments have become impossible, why not, as Paul asked, eat 

and drink, since tomorrow we die? This is a question that secular reason 

should take far more seriously than it ever has.<P>

It is a question to which all of us need an answer. The need is partly 

political. There can be no decent polities unless many people can resist 

the historical discouragement so natural in our times. The consumer 

society and fascism exemplify the possible outcome when nations are 

populated predominantly by people incapable of the hesitation in which 

reality needs to be faced or the hope in which it must be judged and 

reshaped.<P>

The need is also personal. In its depths the life of an individual is 

historical and political because it is one with the lives of all human 

beings. To despair of history is to despair of one's own humanity. Today 

we are strongly tempted to split the individual and history, the personal 

and the political. When this occurs, personal being is truncated and 

impoverished. People in earlier times of bewilderment and disillusionment, 

such as the era of the downfall of the ancient city-state system, were 

similarly tempted, and a standard of life first clearly enunciated by 

Epicurus in the aftermath of the Macedonian conquest of the city-states is 

still, in the twentieth century. attractive. Epicurus called for 

withdrawal from public life and political activity; he argued that 

everything essential to one's humanity, such as friendship, can be found 

in the private sphere. Personal life thus is salvaged from the raging 

torrent of history. But it is also mutilated, for it is severed from the 

human situation in its global scope and its political contours.<P>

The absorption of Americans in the pleasures of buying and consuming, of 

mass entertainment and sports, suggests an Epicurean response to our 

historical trials. The dangers--erosion of the grounds of political health 

and impairment of personal being--are evident.<P>

Being good politically means not only valuing the things that are truly 

valuable but also having the strength to defend those things when they are 

everywhere being attacked and abandoned. Such strength is exemplified by 

Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the great German pastor and theologian, who 

uncompromisingly opposed the Nazi regime from the beginning, even to the 

extent of returning to Germany from a guaranteed haven in America to join 

the anti-Hitler resistance. Arrested by the Gestapo, he was killed at the 

end of the war. One of Bonhoeffer's prayers, composed in prison, was, 

"Give me the hope that will deliver me from fear and faintheartedness." 

Much that I have tried to say in the preceding pages might be summarized 

simply in this question: If we turn away from transcendence, from God, 

what will deliver us from a politically fatal fear and faintheartedness?<p>

<blockquote>

	<i><font size=4>California will cease to be a democratic polity unless it 

	lets its Mexican immigrants vote in local elections. Politically 

	impossible?  Yes--but a dramatically successful experiment in effective 

	border control could change that political calculus</i></font><p>

	

	

	<pre>

	

	</pre>

	

	<font size=5>I</font>n California immigration has become a hot political topic without quite

becoming a debate. Like crime, it is a topic over which Californian political

candidates contend mostly by going faster or further than their opponents in

the same general direction. Control of the border, restrictions on even legal

immigration, repatriation of illegal immigrants imprisoned for crimes committed

in California, the reduction of health and education benefits for illegal

immigrants, and an aggressive insistence that Washington pay the bill for

policies made in Washington--proposals like these define the flow, and no one

who aspires to office dares go against it. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne

Feinstein, both Democrats, both liberals, have each offered restrictionist

immigration-reform proposals. Governor Pete Wilson, arriving a bit late on the

scene and quietly jettisoning pro-immigration policies that he championed as a

Republican senator, has offered proposals far more sweeping, including a

patently unconstitutional demand that citizenship be denied to the

American-born children of illegal immigrants. Democratic gubernatorial

candidate Kathleen Brown, the daughter of one former governor and the sister of

another, has her own immigration-reform agenda. All these politicians are

responding to an uncompromising public mood.<p>



<p>



Into the teeth of this gale comes an article published last year, in the

anthology The California-Mexico Collection, making the bold suggestion that

illegal Mexican immigrants to California should be not just legalized but also

given the vote. Jorge G. Castaneda, a noted Mexican intellectual, writes in

"Mexico and California: The Paradox of Tolerance and Dedemocratization" that,

all other cultural and economic issues aside, the presence of a large, growing,

and permanently disenfranchised Mexican population in California is subverting

the state's most basic tradition--its democracy. "Through no fault of its own,

undocumented Mexican immigration is contributing to the "dedemocratization" of

California society. . . . by the end of the twentieth century, the richest

state in the world will have a terribly skewed political system, with a foreign

plurality that works, consumes, and pays taxes, but does not vote, run for

office, organize, or carry much political clout."<p>



<p>



Californians who have commented on the political disenfranchisement (or

non-enfranchisement) of illegal immigrants from Mexico have tended to see it as

a problem for the immigrants themselves: lacking the vote, the immigrants lack

influence. Castaneda sees the same disenfranchisement as a problem for

California as a democratic society. Sixty-three percent of the students of the

Los Angeles Unified School District are Latinos, many of whose parents are

legally ineligible to vote; but, according to a former Los Angeles school board

member, 75 percent of registered voters in California and 88 percent of those

who actually vote have no children in school. True, parents are hurt by

nonparents who refuse to be taxed to educate other people's children,

but--Castaneda would argue--to see the resulting harm in classic interest-group

terms is to misconstrue it. In a normal, healthy democracy, the self-interest

of the parents, which coincides with the long-term self-interest of the

society, would be backed by plenty of votes. A democratic society in which the

parents of many children in the public school system lack the vote is abnormal

and unhealthy. Whatever the laws on its books, it is, de facto, both

undemocratic and dysfunctional.<p>



<p>



That Castaneda has identified a grave weakness in California's democracy is, I

think, irrefutable. And yet his remedy for this weakness is perfectly

calculated to send an already inflamed controversy deeper into the flames: "The

only realistic way to alter the negative effect of Mexican influence on

California . . . is to change the nature of its origin by legalizing

immigration and giving foreigners the right to vote in state and local

elections." Castaneda recognizes that in practical, political terms, the odds

against his view's prevailing in the near term are insuperable. "The real

stumbling block is that the decision to legalize immigration will not be made

by those who would benefit from it most--the bottom tier--but rather by a

white, Anglo, middle-class, and elderly electorate. The only way to change the

nature of California politics is through legalization, but the only way to

achieve legalization is to change the nature of California politics. Not an

easy circle to square."<p>



<p>



Castaneda draws a modicum of encouragement from the fact that Sweden, Denmark,

Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Switzerland have granted

foreigners the right to vote in state and municipal legislative elections.

Following their lead, he proposes not that immigrant Mexicans be naturalized

but rather that, while remaining Mexicans and without acquiring dual

citizenship, they be allowed to vote in California state and local elections

only. He recognizes that tradition in the United States has seen naturalization

and the vote as inseparable, but this inseparability is just the part of the

tradition that he believes must change. "The choice . . . lies between

enfranchisement along European lines or continuing to deny foreigners political

rights and relegating them to the bottom tier of California society. The fact

that the problem is so strongly concentrated in California should serve as an

incentive to finding a state or municipal solution. What happens in California

or Los Angeles and San Jose need not be a federal policy applicable throughout

the country."<p>



<p>



There is a daring plausibility to Castaneda's analysis, but if California were

to accept his proposal, the state would be saying, in effect, that on so

crucial a matter as the prerogatives of citizenship its relationship to Mexico

counts for more than its relationship to the United States. After all, no

comparable crisis of "dedemocratization" yet looms for the country as a whole.

If Mexicans are understood to have migrated from Mexico to the United States,

rather than to California, it would seem to be up to the federal government to

determine their status, including their eligibility to vote in even local

elections. Castaneda, however, prefers to see these immigrants as having come

only to California rather than to the United States--a bold move on his part.<p>



<p>



Like all the contributors to the anthology in which his article appears,

Castaneda assumes that the U.S. Border Patrol is not and never will be a factor

in the demographic future of the California-Mexico connection. Only one of his

fellow contributors so much as mentions the Border Patrol, and then only to

include it among potentially delinquent elements to which "the California

connection itself may become hostage." For the rest, the constant assumption in

The California-Mexico Connection is that illegal immigration is as

uncontrollable as the weather. It is not a policy, in other words, but simply a

large, generally benign fact.<p>



<p>



Against this background the sudden, unprecedented success of the Border Patrol

at slowing--indeed, almost halting--illegal Mexican immigration across the Rio

Grande at El Paso, Texas, a major entry point, comes as something of a

thunderbolt. On the one hand, it opens the possibility that immigration may

become a policy again rather than a quasi-natural fact. On the other hand, it

opens the way, paradoxically, to the acceptance, in some form, of Castaneda's

otherwise unacceptable proposal.<p>



<p>



From September 19 to October 2, 1993, the El Paso Border Patrol, under Chief

Silvestre Reyes, quietly but suddenly closed the several breaches in the border

fence that had been major entry points for illegal immigrants, and

simultaneously instituted a strategic reform and redeployment of the patrol's

forces. The reform was a sharp de-emphasis of the hot pursuit of illegal

immigrants after they cross the border. The redeployment was a new

concentration of agents along the borderline itself. Of 650 agents in the

district, 400 were now deployed along the border; in the downtown El Paso area

they were stationed in a line of sight, each to the next. At the start there

were also temporary reinforcements from both the Border Patrol proper and the

Immigration and Naturalization Service, which has charge of a bridge where most

legal entry occurs. The total additional cost of the two-week Operation

Blockade, including repair of the fences and overtime, was only $300,000.

Shortly after the start of the operation Reyes announced that the new approach

would continue indefinitely, without new funding, as Operation Hold the Line.<p>



<p>



Hold the Line would have been a better name for the initial operation, which

never sealed the border or halted legal permanent or temporary border crossing

from Ciudad Juarez, just across the Rio Grande. The continuation of normal,

peaceful interaction across a border regulated but not sealed only makes

Reyes's results the more impressive. Apprehensions for illegal entry along the

El Paso border have dropped to about 150 from an average daily level of 800 to

1,000. Since as many as half of all border crossers into El Paso come to work

in greater El Paso, statistics for those going beyond El Paso by plane or train

are of particular interest--and as it happens, those numbers are even more

dramatic. According to John L. Martin, who last December published under the

auspices of the Center for Immigration Studies the fullest account to date of

the continuing operation, "Apprehensions resulting from train checks have

decreased by 90 percent. Airport apprehensions, regularly numbering in the

hundreds, and which hit a record level of 1,034 last July 4, are now averaging

8-15 per day."<p>



<p>



Seventy to 75 percent of the citizens and legal residents of El Paso are of

Hispanic descent, and mistaken arrests by the Border Patrol have resulted in a

series of lawsuits, particularly in connection with Bowie High School, near the

Rio Grande, where illegal border crossers reportedly have sought cover in the

school crowd. Martin claims that this problem has now been all but eliminated.

"Chief Reyes noted on November 8 that, since assuming the new operational

deployment of deterrence rather than apprehension, there has not been a single

new complaint from the public. He pointed out in a similar vein that there had

not been a single shooting incident involving his forces since then, either."

Not in jest, Martin reports a new morale problem in the El Paso Border Patrol:

the new techniques, substituting deterrence for pursuit, are so effective that

the agents are bored.<p>



<p>



Though no scientific opinion poll has been taken, the El Paso Times reported on

September 23 that telephone calls to the newspaper were running ten to one in

favor of the new policy. The Ciudad Juarez Chambers of Commerce and Industry

did oppose it, and even called for a boycott of El Paso businesses. There was,

briefly, a decline in trade at the downtown stores nearest the border, perhaps

partly because of the misleading initial use of the word "blockade." Outlying

stores were unaffected, however, and by October even the downtown stores were

back to 85 to 90 percent of their pre-operation volume, with a substantial

reduction in shoplifting and car theft.<p>



<p>



The policy has detractors beyond the Ciudad Juarez Chamber of Commerce. The

Roman Catholic bishop of El Paso opposes it. Residents of Ciudad Juarez

accustomed to crossing freely into El Paso to work also oppose it. In one of

three demonstrations hundreds of marchers chanted "We want to work." Shortly

after the operation began, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times, it

was denounced in a Mexican diplomatic note dispatched to the State Department.

And yet, a bit surprisingly, the mayor of Ciudad Juarez was quoted as being in

favor of it, perhaps because of the difficulty that the permanent residents of

his city have had in coping with the criminal "coyotes" who prey upon

prospective emigrants.<p>



<p>



How important a precedent is El Paso? Operation Hold the Line is in effect

along only a twenty-mile stretch of border separating El Paso from Ciudad

Juarez, and attempted border crossings east or west of that twenty-mile stretch

have risen slightly. Still, though smaller than Tijuana-San Diego, Ciudad

Juarez-El Paso is of major importance. Its combined population comes to more

than 1.5 million. The normal rate of legal border crossing there is estimated

by the INS at 120,000 a day, or well over 35 million a year. If the approach

taken in Operation Hold the Line has reduced the level of apprehensions for

illegal border crossing--the nearest available objective measure of illegal

traffic--at such a major entry point by more than 85 percent while keeping the

border open to ordinary traffic, staying within the existing border-control

budget, and lowering the level of violence and citizens' complaints, then this

approach certainly merits serious consideration as a border-control model.

Reyes's El Paso redeployment, as noted, brought 400 of the district's 650

agents to the border proper. Until recently the San Diego Border Patrol had

fewer than a hundred of its 1,000 agents guarding the line. Last February,

under public pressure, Attorney General Janet Reno announced that the San Diego

contingent would gradually grow by another 400, and the commissioner of the

INS, Doris Meissner, predicted a linked and again gradual shift from the inland

apprehension of border-crossers to El Paso's approach, deterrence at the border

itself. Reyes's success in El Paso may well have owed something to sudden

implementation and surprise, however, and there will be no comparable surprise

in San Diego. In addition, Martin, in a telephone interview, cited Reyes on the

potential importance of a "desperation factor" in San Diego. Tijuana may differ

from Ciudad Juarez, Martin explained, in that more of the migrants arriving

there are simultaneously at the end of a long journey and at the end of their

resources.<p>



<p>



These are all important considerations, but they may mean only that if

comparable results are ever achieved in San Diego, they will be achieved on a

budget higher than Reyes's amazingly low one. Reyes has called into question

the claim that controlling the border would be fiscally prohibitive if not

technically impossible. He has also called into question the quite common claim

that even if not technically impossible or fiscally prohibitive, controlling

the border would entail a level of brutal militarization that would appall the

nation and the world. The image summoned up has been that of the Volkspolizei

of the former East Germany, peering through the cross hairs of their

high-powered rifles at fugitives creeping past the barbed wire. But Reyes, whom

Martin describes as a quiet, low-key, unconfrontational leader, has become

dramatically more efficient at halting illegal immigration while all but

eliminating violence by the Border Patrol agents under his command--and while

winning, it would appear, warm support from a 70 percent Latino community with

intimate ties to a sister city across the Rio Grande. The significance of this

several-faceted success is hard to exaggerate.<p>



<p>



Because of their intellectual investment in the thesis that the border cannot

be policed, many immigration advocates will want to prove that Reyes's success

is temporary or illusory--but they should consider the potential gain for the

huge population of immigrants already in the United States should his success

prove replicable and permanent. At stake, in brief, is another mass amnesty for

illegal immigrants like the one that occurred in 1986.<p>



<p>



At the moment there is absolutely no chance of a second such amnesty. On the

contrary, American political leadership, spearheaded by Californians, is

hell-bent on reducing, not enhancing, benefits to immigrants, which are now

perceived narrowly as mere incentives for further immigration. In a way

Castaneda saw this coming. Having proposed the mass legalization and

enfranchisement of illegal immigrants, he wrote in The California-Mexico

Connection, "There is no dispute that legalization poses costs and perils. The

main danger lies in the incentive for future immigration and in the increased

migratory flows that would undoubtedly result in the short term. But these

costs are clearly no greater than the costs of the status quo, which threatens

to tear California society apart."<p>



<p>



But why should this incentive exist only in the short term? Worldwide, the

supply of desperately poor potential migrants is essentially infinite. Illegal

immigration across the U.S.-Mexican border is only a part of that much larger

problem. It is the most visible part, however; and unless the border can be

controlled, the political trend will be precisely the opposite of what

Castaneda would wish, as indeed it has been during the past year.<p>



<p>



And yet this backlash is ultimately against a perceived and frightening loss of

control, rather than against Mexicans as a racial or ethnic group. Accordingly,

if legalization can be seen again as a measure promising a restoration of

control--that is, if it can be made to function as something other than an

incentive--then it may yet attract surprising support. The 1986 Immigration

Reform and Control Act was accepted as a once-only great compromise. The mass

legalization of then-illegal immigrants was traded for the promise that a new

program of employer sanctions would destroy the incentive for further mass

immigration. That hope proved vain; but if it had never been entertained, IRCA

would never have passed.<p>



<p>



Until Americans have some assurance that a new mass legalization will not

function as an incentive, they will never vote for it. It is not that the last

foreigner to be naturalized must have been naturalized at the time of a new

mass legalization. What is required is rather and only that control be so

firmly and clearly re-established that decisions on admittance to the

country--and admittance to the voting booth--will be at the discretion of the

American host and not of the foreign guest. Employer sanctions alone, however

severe, will never be enough to bring this about, but employer sanctions

combined with truly effective policing of the border might be.<p>



<p>



And in that case the IRCA compromise, now a bitter embarrassment to many who

backed it at the time, may return in a new form. Immigration "restrictionists"

will have to agree to legalize illegal immigrants who are already in the

country. Immigration "admissionists" will have to surrender the notion that

there is no such thing as an illegal immigrant (there are only "undocumented

workers") and agree to an effective, publicly backed Border Patrol assuring

tight control over the largest single source of future illegal immigration.<p>



<p>



Unlikely? No doubt--but surely no more unlikely than the indefinite maintenance

of a status quo that nearly all parties to the immigration debate find

unacceptable.<p>

<blockquote>

<p>

<p><br><p><br>

<font size=5>I</font>n 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville submitted an Essay on 
Pauperism to the Royal Academic Society of Cherbourg. The Essay addressed 
itself to a striking contemporary paradox:  why, in the most "opulent" (we 
would say, more timidly,. "affluent") nation in the world--that is, 
England--was there such an extraordinary problem of "pauperism" (what we 
would now call "welfare": poor people on poor relief)?  In France and 
Spain and Portugal, he pointed out, the people were all much poorer than 
in England;  and the average Spaniard was poor even in comparison with the 
English pauper on poor relief.  But in none of these poorer countries was 
there a "pauper problem" of the kind that agitated English society and 
English politics.  How could one account for that "apparently 
inexplicable" phenomenon?<p><pre>

</pre>

<font size=4><b>"Enough"</font></b><p>

     Tocqueville's answer was twofold.  First, urbanization and 
industrialization made the poor more dependent on public charity for a 
minimum level of subsistence.  In an agrarian economy, it was only in rare 
periods of famine that the poorest rural laborer could not get enough to 
eat--"enough" meaning here simply a diet that would avert starvation.  In 
contrast, the poor in a modern city have no such normal, minimum 
guarantee;  they are therefore in frequent need of public assistance, if 
they are to keep body and soul together.<p>

     Second, in an "opulent" society the idea of poverty itself undergoes 
a continual redefinition. The poor experience not only the need for a 
guaranteed minimum;  they also suffer from what a modern sociologist would 
call "relative deprivation." Tocqueville puts the matter this way:<p><blockquote>

     "Among civilized peoples, the lack of a multitude of things causes 
poverty.... In a country where the majority is ill-clothed, ill-housed, 
ill-fed, who thinks of giving clean clothes, healthy food, comfortable 
quarters to the poor?  The majority of the English, having all these 
things, regard their absence as a frightful misfortune:  society believes 
itself bound to come to the aid of those who lack them     In England, the 
average standard of living a man can hope for in the course of his life is 
higher than in any other country of the world.  This greatly facilitates 
the extension of pauperism in that kingdom." [* See endnote]</blockquote><p>

     But Tocqueville did not stop with this explanation--a persuasive and 
not particularly controversial explanation--of why wealthy nations have so 
many "paupers."  He went on to assert that public assistance and 
"pauperdom" existed in a symbiotic relationship, and he predicted that 
each would nourish the other, that both would inexorably grow.  Behind 
this remarkable prediction was a view of human nature.  "There are," he 
wrote, "two incentives to work:  the need to live and the desire to 
improve the conditions of life.  Experience has proven that the majority 
of men can be sufficiently motivated to work only by the first of these 
incentives.  The second is only effective with a small minority.... A law 
which gives all the poor a right to public aid, whatever the origin of 
their poverty, weakens or destroys the first stimulant and leaves only the 
second intact."<p>

     At this point, we are bound to draw up short and take our leave of 
Tocqueville. Such gloomy conclusions, derived from a less than benign view 
of human nature, do not recommend themselves either to the 
twentieth-century political imagination or to the American political 
temperament. We do not like to think that our instincts of social 
compassion might have dismal consequences--not accidentally but 
inexorably.  We simply cannot believe that the universe is so 
constituted.  We much prefer, if a choice has to be made, to have a good 
opinion of mankind and a poor opinion of our socioeconomic system.  We 
shall, for instance, be more sympathetic, if not to the specific argument, 
then at least to the general approach of Regulating the Poor: The Function 
of Public Welfare by Frances Fox Piven and Richard A. Cloward recently 
published by Pantheon.<p><pre>

</pre>

<font size=4><b>Mystery</font></b><p>

     Professors Piven and Cloward, both leading "activists" in the Welfare 
Rights Movement, have written a valuable book--but, alas. a confusing 
one.  The confusion results from the two purposes they have in mind.<p>

     The first purpose, which they achieve in an excellent and even 
masterly way, is to answer the same question that perplexed Tocqueville: 
why has there been such a fantastic "welfare explosion" in the United 
States?  Specifically, why has there been such an extraordinary growth in 
our welfare population after 1964--after, that is, unemployment began to 
move down toward the unprecedented (in peacetime, anyway) low level of 3.5 
percent? Between 1964 and 1968. we had general prosperity of a kind not 
known since World War II.<p>

     This prosperity was not, of course, shared equally by rich and poor, 
white and black:  but all did demonstrably and substantially share in it.  
Nevertheless, it was precisely during those years that the "welfare 
explosion" took place.<p>

     I do not think it is sufficiently appreciated by the public at large 
just how baffling this event was to our scholars and our policy-makers in 
Washington.  For half a decade, our best minds puzzled over the 
statistics, held innumerable conferences to discuss them, and got 
nowhere.  The only serious effort at explanation was made by Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, in his famous and brilliant memorandum on the Negro 
family, in 1965.  He called attention to the fact that most of the new 
welfare recipients were in the Aid to Dependent Children category, that a 
growing proportion of families in this category were black and fatherless, 
and that the disorganization of the Negro family seemed to have gathered a 
sociological momentum of its own--a momentum impervious to the effects of 
improving economic circumstances.  Why this was happening to the Negro 
family, however, Mr. Moynihan could not convincingly explain. This 
permitted a great many liberal-minded scholars to spend all of their 
energies attacking him rather than the problem.<p>

     But, eventually, any social phenomenon yields up its mystery.  Or, to 
put it another way:  eventually. all social observers, no matter how 
blurred their vision may be by tacit ideological presuppositions, come to 
see the obvious.  We now know what caused the "welfare explosion." I would 
also say--though this topic is still exceedingly controversial--that we 
are coming to realize what has been causing the disorganization of the 
Negro family.<p>

     All the facts are lucidly and authoritatively presented by Professors 
Piven and Cloward. Unfortunately they have felt compelled to wrap their 
findings in a thin, transparently false general theory of welfare in a 
capitalist society.<p>

     This general theory is so simpleminded, so crude in a quasi-Marxist 
way, that one is embarrassed to summarize it. I will therefore let the 
authors state it for themselves:<p><blockquote>

     "...Relief arrangements [under capitalism] are not shaped by the 
impulse to charity... [they are created and sustained to help deal with 
the malfunctions inherent in market economies.<p>


     "Relief arrangements are usually initiated or expanded in response to 
the political disorders that sometimes follow from the sharp economic 
downturns or dislocations that periodically beset market systems.  The 
purpose of relief-giving at such times is not to ease hunger and want but 
to deal with civil disorder among the unemployed.  Once stability is 
restored, however, the relief system is not ordinarily eliminated.  
Instead, it is reorganized to buttress the normal incentives of the labor 
market.  This is done in two ways. The main way is by cutting the 
'able-bodied' off the rolls whether or not there are jobs, and whether or 
not the wages offered are sufficient for survival.  Second, some of those 
who cannot work or who are not needed in the labor market are allowed to 
continue on the relief rolls, but they are treated so barbarously as to 
make of them a class of pariahs whose degradation breeds a fear and 
loathing of pauperism among the laboring classes."</blockquote><p>



     Now, the objections to this theory on historical, sociological, and 
economic grounds--are too numerous to mention.  But one objection ought to 
be definitive:  it does not explain what Piven-Cloward elsewhere in the 
book explain so well--that is, the "welfare explosion" of the 1960s.  
True, the "welfare explosion" coincided with rioting in the black slums.  
But according to the general theory, the poor in the black slums should 
not have been rioting at all, since the economy was booming and black 
unemployment was at an all-time low:  and if they did riot, it should have 
been because they were being pushed off welfare into low-paying jobs.  In 
fact, they were rioting while they were going on welfare in ever 
increasing numbers--and while welfare payments were being increased, not 
while they were being cut back.<p>

     The true explanation of the "welfare explosion" is available to any 
reader of Regulating the Poor who will ignore the authors' general 
theory.  (This is easily done:  once they have stated the theory, they 
happily forget all about it when discussing the 1960s.)  This "explosion" 
was created--in part intentionally, in larger part unwittingly--by public 
officials and public employees who were executing public policies as part 
of a "War on Poverty."  And these policies had been advocated and enacted 
by many of the same people who were subsequently so bewildered by the 
"welfare explosion."  Not surprisingly it took them a while to realize 
that the problem they were trying to solve was the problem they were 
creating.<p>

     Here, as related in Piven-Cloward's book, are the reasons behind the 
"welfare explosion" of the 1960s:<p>

     1. The number of poor people who are eligible for welfare will 
increase as one elevates the official definitions of "poverty" and 
"need."  The War on Poverty elevated these official definitions;  
therefore, an increase in the number of "eligibles" automatically followed.<p>

     2. The number of eligible poor who actually apply for welfare will 
increase as welfare benefits go up--as they did throughout the 1960s.  
When welfare payments (and associated benefits. such as Medicaid and food 
stamps) compete with low wages, many poor people will rationally prefer 
welfare.  In New York City today, as in many other large cities, welfare 
benefits not only compete with low wages;  they outstrip them.<p>

     3. The reluctance of people actually eligible for welfare to apply 
for it--a reluctance based on pride or ignorance or fear--will diminish if 
an organized campaign is instituted to "sign them up." Such a campaign 
was  successfully launched in the 1960s by (a) various community 
organizations sponsored and financed by the Office of Economic 
Opportunity, (b) the Welfare Rights Movement, and (c) the social work 
profession, which was now populated by college graduates who thought it 
their moral duty to help people get on welfare--instead of, as used to be 
the case, helping them get off welfare.  In addition, the courts 
cooperated by striking down various legal obstacles (for example, 
residence requirements).<p>

     In summary, one can say that the "welfare explosion'' was the work, 
not of "capitalism" or of any other "ism," but of men and women like Miss 
Piven and Mr. Cloward--in the Welfare Rights Movement, the social work 
profession, the office of Economic Opportunity, and so on.  It would be 
nice to think that the "general theory" in Regulating the Poor was devised 
mainly out of an excess of modesty.<p><pre>

</pre>

<font size=4><b>Connection</font></b><p>

     It should be emphasized that Piven-Cloward think the "welfare 
explosion" is a good thing.  They believe more people should be on welfare 
and that these people should get far more generous benefits than now 
prevail.  One would expect, therefore, that this book would have a 
triumphant tone to it.  Yet it does not.  Indeed, it ends rather abruptly, 
in a minor key.<p>

     The reason, one suspects, is that even Piven-Cloward must be less 
than certain about what they have accomplished.  Somehow, the fact that 
more poor people are on welfare, receiving more generous payments, does 
not seem to have made this country a nicer place to live--not even for the 
poor on welfare, whose condition seems not noticeably better than when 
they were poor and off welfare. Something appears to have gone wrong:  a 
liberal and compassionate social policy has bred all sorts of 
unanticipated and perverse consequences.<p>

     One such perverse consequence, and surely the most important, is the 
disorganization and demoralization of the Negro family.  It used to be 
thought that a generous welfare program, liberally administered, would 
help poor families stick together.  We now find that as many poor black 
families are breaking up after they get on welfare as before they got on;  
and that, in general, the prospect of welfare does nothing to hold a poor 
family together.  Mr. Moynihan was percipient in emphasizing, back in 
1965, that there was a connection between family disorganization and the 
influx of poor black female-headed families to welfare.  What we can now 
see is that the existence of a liberal welfare program might itself have 
been responsible, to a significant extent, for this family disorganization.<p><pre>

</pre>

<font size=4><b>Unmanned</font></b><p>

     One must emphasize here that the question of race or ethnicity is of 
secondary importance.  It is true that the Negro family has experienced 
historical vicissitudes that make it a relatively vulnerable institution.  
But it is also probable--I would go so far as to say certain--that if the 
Irish immigrants in nineteenth-century America had had something 
comparable to our present welfare system, there would have been a "welfare 
explosion" then, and a sharp increase in Irish family disorganization, 
too.  The family is, in our society, a vital economic institution.  
Welfare robs it of its economic function.  Above all, welfare robs the 
head of the household of his economic function, and tends to make of him a 
"superfluous man."  Welfare, it must be remembered, competes with his 
(usually low) earning ability;  and the more generous the welfare program, 
the worse he makes out in this competition.<p>

     Is it surprising, then, that--unmanned and demoralized--he removes 
himself from family responsibilities that no longer rest on his 
shoulders?  That he drifts out of his home--or is even pushed out of his 
home--into the male street-corner society of the slum?  One wonders how 
many white middle-class families would survive if mother and children were 
guaranteed the father's income (or more) without the father's presence?  
And how many white middle-class fathers would, under these circumstances, 
persist at their not-always-interesting jobs?<p>

     To raise such questions is to point to the fundamental problems of 
our welfare system, a vicious circle in which the best of intentions merge 
into the worst of results.  It is not easy to imagine just how we might 
break out of this vicious circle.  One might suggest, however, that we 
begin by going back and reading Tocqueville more respectfully.  We may not 
find the truth in him;  but the exercise may help liberate us from our own 
twentieth-century illusions.<p>

	<font size=5>S</font>trollers about the Capitol at Washington frequently pause to admire the

ingenuity and the studious habits of a certain respectable colored man who

serves as door-keeper to an august national court. It is an established

principle at Washington that an American citizen visiting the capital of his

beloved country shall never be allowed to open a door for himself; and,

consequently, wherever there is a door, there must needs be a door-keeper. A

being more superfluous than a door-keeper to the room in which this high court

is held it would be difficult to imagine. The door has been provided by a

grateful nation with a convenient loop or handle of brass, adapted to the

meanest capacity, and with a spring which causes it gently to close without the

interposition of human hands. It closes, too, upon something soft, so that

there is no danger of the deliberations of the court being disturbed by a bang.

Most of the persons who enter the room are familiar with all its arrangements;

and if their hands should chance to be full of papers, they could easily thrust

out one little finger, and, inserting it in the handle, pull the light and

unlatched door wide open. Nor does the door-keeper show to a seat the

awe-struck visitors who are occasionally attracted to the apartment by

curiosity. Within the room other officers, white in color, or higher in rank,

stand ready to prevent ladies from rushing forward to the bench of the judges

or losing themselves among the lawyers within the bar. The sole business of

that respectable colored man from 11 A.M. to 3 P.M. is to open a light door

which shuts itself. Being a man of resources, he has provided himself with a

chair and tied a string to the handle of his door. He goes to his place every

morning provided with reading-matter, and there he sits, holding his newspaper

or book in one hand, and the end of his string with the other. When any one

approaches, he knows it by instinct, and gives the string a mechanical pull,

without looking up or being mentally aware that he has performed an official

duty.<p>



<p>



Behold the typical man in him! He represents a class in Washington. He is one

of the small sins which Congress permits and commits.<p>



<p>



The sins of this kind which Congress commits are worse than those which it

permits. After satisfying the curiosity of the ladies with a view of the

Supreme Court,--a work of three minutes,--you naturally ascend to the gallery

of the Senate. This is the paradise of door-keepers. I think I counted fourteen

doors to this gallery. There are doors which admit only ambassadors,

door-keepers' friends, and other privileged persons. There are doors which

exclude the public from the Reporters' Gallery, writing-room, and telegraph

office. There are many doors which admit ladies, and many more that open into

the portions of the gallery used chiefly as a warming-place by unemployed

negroes. Each of these doors consists of two leaves that swing together, and

are kept shut by the attraction of gravitation. What a field for door-keeping

is here! At nearly every leaf of these numerous doors sits or stands a

door-keeper, his hand inserted in his brass loop,--one man outside to let in

the coming, and another inside to let out the parting guests. From their

keeping such a tight clutch upon their handles, I think there must be more

door-keepers than there are doors. Every man seems afraid that if he should let

go his handle another might get hold of it, and thus rob him of his slight

pretext for being on the pay-roll. Half a dozen locks and a hundred latch-keys

would deprive of all semblance of pretext the gentlemen who exclude the

miscellaneous public from the Ambassadors' Gallery and the Reporters'

apartments: and the rest of the door-keeping could be well done by two men. But

that would never do in Washington. The pretext for being on the pay-roll is the

very thing wanted.<p>



<p>



If the visitor is rash enough to hint that two men to each door is rather a

lavish expenditure of human force, considering the scarcity of labor on this

continent, he is silenced by the question, How could two or three or half a

dozen men "clear the galleries"? They could not. Nor could forty, if the

auditors were determined to sit fast. But the Speaker's simple order, addressed

to people habituated and wholly disposed to obey properly constituted

authority, clears them with all requisite despatch. If not, there are

thirty-three bored, yawning, inexpressibly idle men about the capitol, in blue

uniform and steeple-crowned hats, who are styled the Capitol police. They have

a captain and two lieutenants, to head any onset upon a stubborn public which

the Speaker might order, and it would relieve the monotony of their existence

to be ordered upon any duty whatever. <p>



<p>



Congress has, indeed, furnished itself most liberally with servants. The

Senate, which consists of seventy-four members, is served by at least one

hundred officers of all grades, from secretary to page. The House, which

numbers two hundred and fifty-three members when the States are fully

represented, has not less than a hundred and fifty officers, although the

investigator does not find so many in the published list. We observe a

considerable number of persons employed about the Capitol whose names elude the

search of those who pore over the Blue Book of Mr. Disturnell, or the useful

and excellent Congressional Directory of Major Ben Perley Poore. If we add to

the officers employed about the two chambers the printers and binders who do

the work of Congress in the public printing-office, we shall find that Congress

has many more servants than members. It may be that most of these are

necessary. The Secretary of the Senate may require the assistance of twenty-one

clerks. The heating-apparatus of the Capitol may be of such a complicated and

tremendous nature that it is as much as fourteen men can do to manage it.

Members may read and consult such a prodigious number of books and documents as

to need the assistance of more librarians than are employed in the Mercantile

Library of New York, which has ten or twelve thousand subscribers, as well as

an immense reading room. Including the librarians of the library proper and

those of the sub-libraries and document-rooms of the two houses, there are

twenty-four persons in the Capitol supposed to be chiefly employed in

ministering to the intellectual wants of members of Congress. All these persons

may be indispensable, but they do not seem so to the casual observer. The

casual observer receives the impression that the servants of Congress, like

those of the government generally, would be improved if two very simple and

easy things were done,--the salary of the chiefs doubled, and the number of

their assistants reduced one half.<p>



<p>



I can show the reader, by relating a little incident which I witnessed in

Washington last winter, how it comes to pass that so many more officers get

appointed than seem to be necessary. While resting in the office of the public

printer, after going over the most admirably complete and efficient

printing-office in the country, a well-dressed, polite young man came in, and

presented a letter of introduction to the superintendent. Clouds gathered over

the face of that functionary as he read it; and he invited the bearer to be

seated in a tone which implied that he wished he was in Jericho. I was

afterward favored  with an explanation of the scene; and that explanation

applies to a large number of the names in the Blue Book. A few days before, the

superintendent had discharged thirty compositors because he had no work for

them. This nice young man, who was one of them, went to one of the senators

from his State, stated his case, and asked the senator to procure his

reappointment. That senator, not considering the gross impropriety of his

interference, but complying with the established custom, wrote a letter to the

superintendent, of some length and much urgency, asking him to put his

constituent back to the place from which he had been removed. I am afraid that

this most improper request was complied with; for the officer to whom it was

addressed was a servant of Congress, who might one day want that senator's

vote. It is of no consequence whether he complied or not. Every reader

acquainted with governments or with human nature knows that nine men out of

ten, in that superintendent's place, would have found work, or a pretence of

work, for that man. Nor can we so much wonder at the conduct of the senator. He

also looks to re-election. He also desires to make friends. This pleasing young

man may have an uncle who controls a newspaper or an iron-foundry in the

senator's State, and it is convenient, at a critical time, to have the hearty

support of a few uncles of that description. The difficulty is, that at

Washington there is no rock of security anywhere in the system, against which

applications like this can strike and be repulsed. If that superintendent were

properly secure in his place, he would have shown the young man to the door,

just as any other printer would have done, with the simple remark that he had

no work for him.<p>



<p>



Some time will probably elapse before the people gain such a triumph over the

politicians as to secure permanency of appointment to government officials.

Meanwhile members of Congress should disdain to listen to applications like

this; especially members whose position has some basis of security.<p>



<p>



A stranger to politics and to Washington is astonished to observe how general

the feeling is, that a public man is justified in gratifying an impulse of

benevolence, or in discharging a private obligation, at the cost of the public.

Some time ago, General Grant chanced to be looking out of a window while a

salute was firing in his honor, and he saw a man lose one of his legs by the

bursting of a cannon. When the man had recovered his health, General Grant was

President of the United States. What more natural than that the President

should ask Mr. Boutwell to give the unfortunate man, if convenient, a

watchman's place in the treasury? He pitied the man, and he had the power to

give him effectual relief at the public expense. Most men would have yielded to

this impulse of benevolence, as General Grant did, and most men perhaps

approved the act. Nevertheless, it is just in this way that the Capitol, the

departments, the post-offices, and the custom-houses get clogged with

superfluous persons. It is thus that one-legged incompetence pushes from its

place two-legged ability. Some one, WHO CANNOT BE REFUSED, asks the

appointment, and then one of two things must happen,--either a man must be

summarily and unhandsomely, if not inhumanly, thrust from his post, or two men

must be set to doing one man's work. Generally, both these things are done. The

two men go on for a while, until some new broom sweeps one or both away, to

make room for the favorites of another irresistible personage.<p>



<p>



An entertaining writer, some weeks ago, favored the public with reminiscences

of former administrations, in order to show that the people cordially sustain a

President who indulges his personal feelings at the people's cost. He told a

story of General Jackson, which might have been true, the incident being

entirely characteristic. "General," asked an old friend of the ex-President, at

his Tennessee Hermitage, "tell me why you kept yourself and all your friends in

trouble, through your first Presidential term, by keeping Mr. Gwinn Marshal of

Mississippi?" To this General Jackson replied: "When my mother fled with me and

my brother from the oppression of the British, who held possession of North

Carolina, we were very, very poor. My brother had a long sickness (occasioned

by a wound received from a British officer because he refused to do some menial

service), and finally died. In the midst of our distress and poverty, an old

Baptist minister called at our log-cabin, and spoke the first kind words my

mother heard in her new home; and this good man continued to call, and he

finally made our house his lodging-place, and continued to prefer it, when

better ones in the neighborhood were at his service. Years rolled on, and this

good man died. Well, sir, when the news was brought me that I was elected

President, I put up my hands and exclaimed, 'Thank God for that, for it will

enable me to give the best office under the government to the son of the old

minister who was the friend of my mother, and of me in my youth'; and I kept my

promise, and, if it had been necessary, I would have sacrificed my office

before he should have been removed."<p>



<p>



The feeling was natural and noble. The only question is, whether a man should

requite at the expense of his country services done to his mother. The relater

of the anecdote appends to it this commentary: "General Jackson was

triumphantly re-elected to a second term." It is true; but is was in spite of

such errors as this, not in consequence of them. Members of Congress who can

remember that mad period of our political history will not justify personal

government by the example of General Jackson.<p>



<p>



Few of us, perhaps, have an adequate sense of the superior sacredness of public

property to private, of public trusts to private. Little things betray our

sluggish public conscience. No man, except a thief, would think of taking a

sheet of postage-stamps from the desk of a banker or merchant; but, in

Washington, it seems to be only men exceptionally honorable who scruple to use,

or even to take, franked envelopes, which appear to be lying about everywhere.

Still fewer have a proper sense of how much worse it is to steal from all their

fellow-citizens than it is to steal from one of them. In everything relating to

government, a citizen of the United States should feel that he is upon his most

sacred honor. We are here in double trust. Our difficult and still doubtful

experiment is for mankind as well as ourselves. I would not magnify a small sin

into a great one; still less would I assume to be more virtuous than others;

and yet it seems to me that a citizen of the United States should shrink from

accepting a proffered frank, as he would avoid touching only enough pitch to

defile the tips of his fingers. I would not blame, but forgive, a Frenchman for

cheating his government, which is itself a cheat; but the citizens of free

countries defraud and despoil themselves when they do or permit an action which

implies that public property is less sacred than private.<p>



<p>



A special calamity of the small sins of Congress is, that their results are

exceedingly conspicuous, and bring upon Congress an amount of odium or ridicule

that ought to be excited only by great transgressions. I have mentioned the

superfluous door-keepers and the swarms of officers everywhere to be seen about

the two chambers. The amount of money wasted upon these gentlemen is not great;

but the waste is obvious and striking. The dullest visitor comprehends that a

small party of ladies can gain admittance to a gallery by a light and easy door

without the assistance of two able-bodied men. Some of the small sins of

Congress entail effects still more glaring, and fix a permanent, unconcealable

stain upon the nation itself. Not a stain upon its honor; but such a stain as a

lady incurs when her dress comes in contact with a freshly painted railing. We

do not want fair Columbia to be thus disfigured. We wish her to be spotless and

glorious even in the garments that she wears and in the ornaments that adorn

her. We desire her to be tasteful in her splendors.<p>



<p>



The reader has probably often asked himself, while wandering about the Capitol,

what could possess Congress to throw away the public money upon some of those

pictures that disgrace the western continent, and human nature generally, in

the Rotunda. He has, perhaps, also, after giving up that conundrum, assayed to

conjecture why no member has risen superior to the clamor of economists, and

proposed an appropriation of two dollars to white-wash them from the view of

mankind. It was bad enough to put them there; but to keep them visible, year

after year, and give new commissions to the painters who produced them, are

acts almost too abominable to be reckoned among the small sins of the national

legislature.<p>



<p>



Congress no doubt interpreted correctly the wishes of the people in making the

Capitol stately and ornate; and it was an exquisite thought to go on decorating

and completing it while the hosts of the Rebellion were intrenched within sight

of its rising dome. Every building that belongs to the nation, every object

that bears upon its surface the letters "U.S.," should have something in its

style and appearance that will convey to the mind of the beholder a feeling of

the imperial grandeur of the country's mission and destiny. Those nasty and

cheap sub-post-offices in the city of New York, and those conspicuously shabby,

rusty, cast-iron lamp-post letter-boxes, are an abomination in my eyes; not

merely because they are stupidly inconvenient, but because they are mean in

appearance; because I desire that whenever American eyes rest upon an object

bearing the stamp of the nation, they rest upon something which they can

contemplate with satisfaction and pride. Hence, it is always a pleasure to get

round to the front of the Capitol, and turn away from the shanties, the shops,

the sand-heaps, the general dilapidation and shabbiness of the region, and gaze

for a while upon the magnificence of that vast range of architecture, with its

avalanches of snowy steps, that glorious dome floating lightly over the centre,

and the small, brilliant flag above each wing, denoting that Congress is in

session. In this brave attempt to express in marble the grandeur and glory of

the United States, we see the prophecy of those chaster splendors, that simpler

magnificence, which will enchant and exalt our grandchildren when they visit

the future and final capital of the country. It was an excellent thing,

perhaps, after all, to try our 'prentice hand on Washington, and exhaust all

the possibilities of error there.<p>



<p>



The interior of the Capitol is chaos, of course. That is unavoidable when a

large building is erected over a smaller one. The visitor forgives and is

amused at the labyrinthine intricacies in which he is continually lost; and

when at last he stands beneath that beautiful dome, which hovers over him like

an open balloon of silk illuminated by the sun, he experiences a renewal of the

joy which the exterior afforded him. Doubtless, we are running too much to

domes; we are putting a dome over every building of much magnitude--it is such

a fruitful source of contracts. But this one justifies itself, and startles the

coldest spectator into admiration. It was also a fine conception to place under

it in that perfect light a series of large historical paintings. Nor was it

necessary that they should be of the highest rank as mere works of art; because

it is not certain that there are now living upon earth artists capable of

executing painting of that magnitude in a truly excellent manner. No artist in

these times can get the many years of large practice which is necessary for the

attainment of the large manner; and, I suppose, the best we can hope for, at

present, in pictures of great size, is correct, refined, excellent

scene-painting. But some of the paintings in the Rotunda, besides being

singularly hideous as pictures, are historical falsehoods, which any school-boy

might be able to detect at a glance. That one, for example, which is supposed

to have been suggested by De Soto and his men discovering the Mississippi

River,--what a curiously ridiculous lie it is, with its display of superb

costumes, its well-conditioned horses, and its plump cavaliers as fresh and

gay, in their silk and velvet, as if they were careering in the streets of

Madrid on a day of festival? What is better known than that these Spaniards

reached the banks of the Great River in woful plight after a wearisome march of

many months through the wilderness! It is also particularly recorded that De

Soto was sparing in expenditure for gay apparel, and that every rag of clothes,

except what his follower wore, was burnt after one of their bloody encounters

with the Indians. An hour's research in the library of Congress, under the

intelligent guidance of the librarian, would have put the painter in possession

of all the picturesque details of the real scenes, and given him subjects for

several pictures of peculiar interest. A picture could have been composed for

that panel which would have such fascinating power as a mere exhibition of

truth, that few would have cared to criticise it as a work of art.<p>



<p>



But the question recurs, Why are such artists employed? The shameful answer is,

Because they lobby for a commission and know how to lobby with effect. It is

not an honest ignorance of art and history which has thus disfigured the

Capitol; for these paintings are the constant theme of ridicule among members

as they are among private citizens. One artist won his commission, it is said,

by assiduous flattery of the wives and daughters of the members of Congress.

While artists of merit were toiling after excellence in distant studios, this

wiser man in his generation was enjoying elegant leisure in the drawing-rooms

of Washington, where he made sketches in the albums of ladies who could

influence votes, or painted their portraits in some Italian or Spanish costume

from his portfolio. He is thought to have secured votes by pretending that the

excellent but not beautiful wife of a member of Congress reminded him

constantly of an exquisite model he once had in Rome,--one of the loveliest

creatures in the world. He had, moreover, some little talent in small

album-sketches and little fancy portraits in costume. This, doubtless, deceived

some members, who did not reflect upon the infinite difference between a grand

historical painting and an imitation of the velvet in a cavalier's doublet. If

that man's claim to the highest honor which the nation can bestow upon an

artist had been openly discussed in committee, his name would never have

reached the House at all. It was private lobbying that brought this dishonor

upon art, upon Congress, and upon the national taste.<p>



<p>



It has been proposed to introduce the rule that no man shall be appointed to

office who seeks office. Congress may rely with certainty the most complete

upon this, that no artist capable of worthily filling one of the panels of the

Rotunda will ever lobby for the commission in the drawing-rooms of Washington.

If that artist should ever be wanted, he will have to be looked for and

solicited. <p>



<p>



The reader has perhaps wondered also why Congress should have selected for the

execution of the national statue of Abraham Lincoln a person of no standing or

experience as an artist. Miss Vinnie Ream is a young lady of perfect

respectability, and, no doubt, highly estimable in her private relations. No

one can blame HER for her good fortune. She has done little more than to open

her mouth and let the plum fall into it. But what has Congress done? Here was a

piece of work to be given out,--the statue of a man as little statuesque as any

we can imagine,--which required in the artist a combination of artistic skill

and JUDGMENT, love of the man, and love of truth. The work was to be seen by

hundreds who had been familiar with the subject, and by tens of thousands who

would take a kind of affectionate interest in the artist's management of its

difficulties. The Abraham Lincoln of future generations was to be created. In

the selection of the artist a national fame was either to be conferred or

enhanced. Congress assigned this work to a girl who had the rudiments of her

art still to learn, and who had given no proof of her capacity to acquire those

rudiments. She exhibited a model. It was about to be overlooked. She burst into

tears. The results to her were, a ten-thousand-dollar commission, a universal

celebrity, and two years in Europe,--three immense boons, either of which had

been a fit requital for long-tried excellence. And, as if this were not enough,

a room was given her in the Capitol itself in which to execute and exhibit her

work. Congress bestowed upon this unknown and untried child honors which it has

persistently withheld from artists who have conferred upon the country whatever

name it has in the world of art, but who hardly know what the word "lobbying"

means. Recognition one tenth as distinct and emphatic as this, how it would

have cheered the early years of the excellent sculptors of whom the country is

proud! Such caprice does not harm THEM; for when Congress confers distinction

thus, it parts with its power to confer honor, and sensibly lessens its own.<p>



<p>



Five minutes' conversation with Miss Vinnie Ream explains this ridiculous

behavior of Congress. She is one of those graceful, animated, bright-eyed

picturesque, undaunted, twinkling little women, who can make men say YES to

anything they ask. She also wore a pretty blue, turban-like covering for her

hair, which was killing at five paces; and there is that in her manner which

puts men in the humor of uttering badinage, and at the same time gives them the

idea that she is a helpless little body who would cry if she could not have her

own way. The visitor to her room in the Capitol had but to stand apart and see

the modest audacity of her demeanor, and observe the assured, lively manner in

which she held a circle of men in conversation, in order to comprehend why

Congress, in its easy, thoughtless good-nature, should have granted to her the

most signal honors it ever bestowed upon an artist.<p>



<p>



Men are naturally susceptible to the picturesque in woman. It is natural also

to feel like caressing and protecting whatever reminds us of tender, graceful

childhood. Members had done well to give a private commission to this agreeable

young lady by way of encouraging her to attempt acquiring some skill in

modelling. But they were false to their trust when they gave her an important

public work to execute. Men who are charged by their fellow-citizens with the

adornment of national edifices and the bestowal of national honors are much to

blame in allowing a blue turban, a pair of speaking eyes, a trim waist, and a

fluent tongue to carry off prizes due only to tried merit. Members can form

little idea of the dishonor, nay, the contempt, which they bring upon Congress

by indulging a whim of this kind. Millions witness the result; only a few

individuals see the bright excuse; and of those few only one sex admits that it

is any excuse at all.<p>



<p>



There is an impression in Washington that a great deal of legislation is

influenced by female lobbyists; and the easy success of this young lady gives

countenance to the idea. A woman of attractive presence and of a certain

audacity of manner, who should be able to live and entertain in handsome style,

could no doubt win favor and votes for some measures. Many members come from

homely homes, the ladies of which have expended their vivacity and beauty in

that American phase of "the struggle for life" which Fanny Fern style,

"grappling with Erin." Such members, when they find themselves in a

drawing-room next to a lady who expends HER vivacity in entertaining them, and

arrays HER beauty in all the charms of novel costume and bewitching decoration,

are only too apt to surrender to the fascinating influence. But such women

cannot be hired to go lobbying. It occasionally happens that a circle

interested in a scheme contains one such who will render the service required.

Generally speaking, however, the female lobby is small and insignificant. A

lady informed me last winter that she had defeated international copyright;

and, indeed, she was the Washington agent of the weak opposing influence. But a

pebble can stop a six-horse coach when it is going UP a steep hill, and the

horses are tired, the driver indifferent, and the passengers asleep. <p>

Of all the smaller sins of Congress, there are none, perhaps, which excite so

much odium as that multitude of petty transgressions covered by the words

"Contingent Expenses." The mere running expenses of Congress, including its

share of the public printing, amount to about twice the revenue of the

government under President Washington. I have tried in vain to get at the total

cost of a session of Congress. The mere list of the Contingent Expenses of the

House fills a volume of two hundred and twenty pages, and there is no hint

anywhere of the sum total. It is certain, however, that a session of Congress

costs the country as much as four millions of dollars, including pay, postage,

printing and contingent expenses. "Will the honorable member from Ohio allow me

five minutes to make an explanation?" asks an honorable member from Somewhere

Else. If that request is granted it costs the people of the United States a

little over six hundred dollars. The chaplain's prayer, which usually lasts one

minute, consumes one hundred and thirty-eight dollars' worth of time every

morning. Calling the Yeas and Nays, an operation of half an hour, comes to over

four thousand dollars. Allowing six months for an average session, and twenty

days a month as the average number of meetings, Congress costs us something

more than thirty-three thousand dollars a day. Who would begrudge his share of

this great expense, if it were necessary? It is not necessary. A vigorous man

of business, who should have the contract for running Congress, could save

enough in the three items of printing, postage and contingencies to double the

salaries of members, give a decent compensation to the justices of the Supreme

Court, the judges of the Court of Claims, and heads of departments, and have a

handsome surplus for himself. Nothing is so extravagant and undemocratic as to

pay such salaries to the judges, cabinet ministers, and members of Congress as

to exclude from those high and honorable posts the great body of able men who

are neither rich nor reckless. A fraction of the mere waste of Washington would

support them all respectably, and render it possible for men of talent who have

little property to serve the government.<p>



<p>



The book of the Contingent Expenses of the House of Representatives is amusing

literature indeed. There is an air of candor about it that edifies the mind. It

looks so VERY honest, the publication of such items as "2 mice-traps, 50 cts."

"Repairing 3 chairs, $1.50" "Easing drawer, 25 cts." "1 paper of needles, 10

cts." "One long poker, $3.00"; and "2 pounds of putty, 25 cts." It is such a

satisfaction to know that the poker which cost so much was long! It is also

interesting to note, that to clean and polish that extremely absurd relic of

barbarism, the "mace," cost three dollars; and that, during one session of

Congress, the people paid for "hauling" more than TEN THOUSAND CART-LOADS of

documents!  There are many items, however, which excite interest of another

kind. When we find two hundred "porte-monnaies" charged at prices ranging form

$1.20 to $4.25 each, we cannot help feeling that each and every one of those

articles is petty fraud. The United States has not undertaken and is not bound

to supply any portion of its servants with porte-monnaies. What a scandal, too,

is that annual penknife business! One thousand and ninety-eight penknives, at

prices averaging about three dollars each, I find after a few minutes' search

charged among the "Contingent Expenses" of the second session of the Fortieth

Congress! I could probably make up the amount to two thousand by going through

the book, in which the items are apparently published, but are really interred

and covered up. There are charges also of "Half dozen Martinique snuff,

$25.00," "50 lbs. of tobacco, $25.00," "2 doz. pocket-scissors, $28.00," "2

doz. hair-brushes, $48.00," "12 cotton stay-laces, $6.00," "5 extra morocco

desks, $67.00," and endless charges for inkstands, newspapers, and periodicals;

stationery by the mountain, of course. I spend my whole time, from January to

December in one unending, unchanging task of spoiling white paper; but I cannot

get through more than three reams per annum, which costs about twelve dollars.

Knowing how far a little stationery will go, I read of the inconceivable

quantities consumed about the Capitol with amazement.<p>



<p>



It is to be hoped that none but men in sound health will be sent to Congress,

for it costs a great deal to get a member home if he should happen to die in

Washington. The following is the bill paid to the Sergeant-at-arms of the House

for transporting the body of a deceased member from Washington to Easton in

Pennsylvania:--<p>

               --------<p>



<p>





           $2,144.65<p>



<p>



The fee system, it appears, is still employed to compensate some of the

officers of Congress. If there is a "call of the House," i.e. a general hunting

up of absent members, the Sergeant-at-arms is permitted to charge five dollars

and twenty cents for "arresting, bringing before the House, and discharging"

each absentee. If a hundred members are absent, which is not unfrequently the

case, a call of the House costs the country five hundred and twenty dollars. If

witnesses are summoned to testify before a committee, the Sergeant-at-arms

charges a fee and mileage for each. Thus every person summoned from New Orleans

to testify with regard to the negro massacre cost us three hundred and

seventeen dollars, and the cost of merely summoning the witnesses in that

affair was $2,392. It cost three hundred and seventeen dollars to summon

"General Hamlin" to testify before a committee. The object of the committee

could no doubt have been accomplished for three cents and a half,--half a cent

for stationery and three cents for postage.<p>



<p>



Now, if money is to be thrown away in this reckless manner, if the Capitol is

to remain the scene of waste and profusion we find it now, then I say the

people have a choice with regard to the persons who shall be benefited by it.

They do not see any justice or any propriety in Henry Wilson's being compelled

to pinch on five thousand dollars a year, while servants of the body to which

he belongs retire rich after four years' service. It brings a blush to the

cheek of every properly constituted person to think that a justice of the

Supreme Court should be compelled to expend his whole salary for two rooms and

the board of his family, while a man who gets stationery contracts sets up his

carriage and buys pictures. If the government is to be plundered at every point

by every hand, it is time the spoils were more fairly divided.<p>



<p>



There is only one remedy for this profusion at the Capitol. Congress has

honestly attempted to cut off the opportunities for petty larcency. It has

attempted it many times, but never with much success. The mileage system, the

franking-privilege, the wild and wondrous waste of stationery, the pocketing of

French inkstands and costly pen-holders, the lugging home of half-reams of

paper, and all the small stealings of committee-rooms, have been, by turns, the

theme of ridicule and the object of legislation. Some leads have been stopped;

but others have been immediately opened, and the same thieves who pilfered

under the old law have plundered under the new. We ought to know by this time

that a privilege is a thing which is always and everywhere abused. We ought to

know that a perquisite is always and everywhere a means of corruption. We ought

to know that nearly every one in the world who is compensated by fees gets much

too much or much too little, or riots in abundance now, to be starved

to-morrow. Let Congressmen simply abolish fees, perquisites, and privileges,

and accept in lieu thereof a proper increase to their salaries,--say, double

what they now receive. Let members pay their own postage, charge no mileage,

subscribe for their own newspapers, buy their own envelopes and writing paper,

and compensate all their officers by salaries.<p>



<p>



Nothing short of this will ever answer the purpose. If Congress should permit

only so much as a bottle of ink to be furnished to each committee-room once a

week, and charged to Contingent Expenses, a widening crevice would be

established through which a torrent of colored fluids would continually pour.

Add pens to the ink, and you would see exquisite pen-holders, fitted with the

most costly diamond-pointed gold pens, and huge cases of the finest products of

Gillott, heaped high in the store-rooms of the Capitol. Complete the list with

paper, and you have a thick volume of wonderful items, and run up a stationery

bill the mere clippings and extras of which build houses and found estates. The

sole remedy is to pay each member a decent compensation,--not less than ten

thousand dollars a year,--and allow neither to members nor to committees so

much as a sheet of foolscap or a penny pen-holder.<p>



<p>



The completion of the Pacific Railroad antiquates the system of mileage, by

destroying the necessity for it. Indeed, ever since railroads brought two

thirds of Congress within forty-eight hours' ride of Washington, a system of

mileage which gives to one member eight dollars for his travelling-expenses, to

another several hundred dollars, and to another several thousands, has been

growing ridiculous. But now that a member from Oregon can get to the capital in

eleven days, it is too absurd to pay him fifteen times as much mileage as Henry

Clay used to get for his six weeks' horseback ride from Kentucky. Away with

Congressional mileage! The honorable member from Oregon will, of course, have

to incur a little more expense in getting to Washington than the honorable

member from Baltimore; but he will not find this an insupportable burden. He

will be pretty sure to have free tickets to most places presented him a few

hours after his election, and I am afraid he will be weak enough to accept them

until Congress makes it unlawful for him to do so. More than that, a palace-car

will be assigned to his exclusive use, as long as the Pacific Railroads have

favors to ask, or retribution to fear, from the body of which he is a member.<p>



<p>



The surrender of the franking-privilege, besides being the most popular act

which Congress could do, would be also one of the most beneficial to itself. It

would operate as a tonic. The flow of buncombe speech would be checked,

millions of infinitesimal frauds would be prevented, and a source of

demoralization would be annihilated. <p>



<p>



Abolish perquisites, abolish fees, abolish privileges, and double salaries.

There would be little buncombe opposition from members and editors who set up a

champions of economy, but their buncombe could be triumphantly refuted if

Congress SAVED the million and a half additional pay out of the running

expenses of the Capitol, the post-office, and the public printing-house.<p>



<p>



I believe I express the opinion of all the gentlemen who have held the office

of public printer, when I say that half a million dollars per annum is worse

than wasted at the public printing-office. Having examined the office, the

reports of the superintendent, and several of the more expensive volumes

issued, I see clearly enough that if there were such an officer as National

Editor, with the usual editorial power to select, cut down, and exclude, he

could save the country much more than half a million a year by merely drawing

his pencil through useless matter. What havoc he would have made, for example,

in the gorgeous quarto (962 pages) in which are preserved the letters,

resolutions, and addresses of condolence called forth by Mr. Lincoln's

assassination! In that huge and splendid work, which cost us eighteen thousand

dollars, there may be ten pages worth saving; and those the National Editor

would have forwarded per boy to Newspaper Row, opposite Willard's, at a cost of

two car tickets. The saving on that one item would have made the Supreme Bench

comfortable for a whole year. In the Agricultural Report for 1867, which fills

five hundred and twenty-two "large octavo pages" handsomely illustrated, of

which two hundred and twenty-four thousand five hundred copies were given away,

at a total expense of a hundred and twenty thousand dollars, what gashes an

intelligent National Editor would have made! or rather, would he not have

selected the valuable portions and sent copies to each of the agricultural

newspapers and periodicals? They would give to matter really valuable all the

publicity that could be desired. The Patent-Office Report has annually swollen,

until it now makes over two thousand pages,--four large octavos, of which one

half the space is occupied by engravings. Of this most expensive work sixty

thousand copies are given away. The Reports of the Commissioners to the Paris

Exposition of 1867 will fill several profusely illustrated volumes, which will

of course be given away profusely. When we read the names of some of the

Commissioners, we know very well what a gifted National Editor would do with

their contributions.<p>



<p>



In the last report of Mr. John Defrees, Congressional printer, a gentleman who

knew the precise value of the mountains of books which Congress ordered him to

manufacture, we find this interesting paragraph:--<p>



<p>



     "The Army Register of Volunteers has also been completed in eight volumes.

Fifty thousand copies were ordered to be printed, FOR SALE AT COST, by the

joint resolution of June 30, 1864. An edition of five thousand copies of the

first four volumes was printed, but finding very little demand for the work,

the edition of the residue of the volumes was reduced to one thousand."<p>



<p>



FOR SALE AT COST! That is the true method, if Congress must manufacture books.

Observe how the enormous error of this publication was rebuked and corrected by

bringing it to the test of sale at cost. If the people want a book they will

buy it at cost; if they will not buy it at cost, it is proof positive that they

do not want it enough to justify an appropriation of their money. It was an

amiable idea to preserve the name of every man who fought for his country

during the war; but to preserve such a catalogue did not necessitate its

publication in eight volumes. Such extravagance keeps alive in the general mind

the false, pernicious idea, that the government may properly expend money on

principles which would be absurd and ruinous in an individual.<p>



<p>



Do members of Congress sell West Point and Annapolis cadetships? I am afraid I

must confess that it has been done. Not often; for members are abundantly

blessed with nephews, and friends who have nephews, and they are generally

besought for those appointments as soon as it is rumored that they intend to

run for Congress. Not often; for members generally want all their small change

of that nature during the canvass. Not often; for few men of an infinitesimal

calibre have yet found their way to Congress. And still I fear that the member

who gave a cadetship to the son of a person who presented his wife with a grand

piano was in some degree influenced by the circumstance. There are lobbyists

who profess to be able to procure cadetships for money, but most of them are

strikers. Some members find their election expenses a heavy burden, and I

believe that, occasionally, a distinct arrangement has been entered into

between a member of the lobby and an anxious father, to this effect: the

anxious father agrees to send a check for two thousand dollars to the chairman

of the member's committee, as a contribution to the expenses of the election,

and the man of the lobby agrees to induce the member to give the anxious

father's son a cadetship in one of the national academies. In a very few

instances such an arrangement may have been fulfilled. Some members, I fear,

regard the duty of making these important appointments in the light of a

perquisite, and, as just remarked, the work "perquisite" is generally

synonymous with corruption. Congress will perform an act as wise as it will be

noble when it relinquishes a privilege that has always been abused, and always

must be, by men who have sons, nephews, and election committees.<p>



<p>



Before leaving this small branch of a large subject, I must not fail to remark

that many of us seem to be unduly alarmed at the corruptions and abuses of the

government. The American people are so accustomed to honestly in their dealings

with one another, and to a certain frugality of ordinary expenditure, that they

start back affrighted from the scene of profusion, and worse than profusion, of

government offices. Let us see then how it is with other governments. Let us

see if government by the people for the people is less or more profuse, less or

more corrupt, than the vaunted governments by a class for a class. <p>



<p>



That is a pretty piece of scandal which advocate Mathieu Marais relates in his

Memoires, of the dissolute Regent of France and the Abbe de Broglie. The Abbe

having warmly commended a certain wine, the Regent said he would like to have

some of it, and the Abbe sent him three hundred bottles. The prince insisted on

paying for them, and accordingly the priest handed him a bill in proper form,

like this:--<p>



<p>



His Royal Highness, the Prince Regent<p>



<p>



       To the Abbe de Broglie.<p>



<p>



60 gallons of wine.......................400 francs<p>



<p>



300 bottles........................................60   "<p>



<p>



300 corks............................................15   "<p>



<p>



Twine.....................................................4    "<p>



<p>



Sealing-wax, Spanish.......................9    "<p>



<p>



Baskets...................................................25  "<p>



<p>



Carriage..................................................7    "<p>



<p>



                                            ----------<p>



<p>



            Total:  The Abbey of Mount St. Michael<p>



<p>



The prince paid the bill. The governorship of an abbey, and a handsome income

for life of other people's money, was the reward which this man, entrusted with

the revenues of church and state, felt to be due to a profligate young

ecclesiastic who had given him a moment's amusement. This was in 1721. Fifty

years later, the young Abbe de Talleyrand won his first preferment, which

consisted of two abbeys, by saying a good thing to Madame Dubarry, the king's

mistress. He, the most licentious young man in Paris, had sat silent while

others amused the mistress with tales of intrigue and gallantry. She asked him

at length why he did not favor the company with one of his numberless amorous

adventures. "Because," said he, assuming a melancholy tone, "in Paris, at

present, it is so much easier to win the favor of ladies than to get preferment

in the Church." This small joke made the king laugh, when it was told to him,

and it was worth to the youth who uttered it the two abbeys just referred to.<p>



<p>



On similar principles the church benefices of every established church on earth

have been usually bestowed. That is to say, the appointing power does not

usually so much as THINK of appointing the fittest attainable man, but gives or

sells benefices, abbeys, bishoprics, archibishoprics, SOLELY for its own

pleasure and purposes. [See Endnote 1]. If the Archbishop of Canterbury should

die to-day, Mr. Gladstone would bestow the vacancy upon that man in England

who, in that place, could do most to help him retain and increase his majority

in the House of Commons; unless, perchance, the services have already been

rendered which give to some person, family, club, or clique a claim to the

appointment. No one could blame him. The system requires it of him. He could

not be Prime-Minister, and act on any other principle.<p>



<p>



A French gentleman resident in New York related to me the other evening the

particulars of a case which he thought showed advantageously for the government

of the present usurper. A custom-house officer at a French seaport, after many

years of faithful service, was dismissed from his place for accepting two gifts

from an importer, of the value of one dollar and thirty cents. Respectable

merchants petitioned for his restoration, but the minister replied that he had

not the power to restore him; there was no provision in the system of the

government for the pardon of such an offence. It simply could not be done. This

was supposed to be extremely virtuous. But, surely, we cannot call that system

pure in which the great thieves want so much that they will not and cannot

permit the little people to steal at all,--which loads with plunder the men who

help steal ALL the revenues of France, and covers with diamonds the women who

assist to dazzle and delude the people. At the very time when this poor old man

was thrust out into hopeless destitution for a momentary weakness or

inadvertence, the woman of one of the head plunderers was selling off some

hundreds of thousands of francs' worth of diamonds merely because she had so

many jewels that she did not know what to do with them. <p>



<p>



In England, too, they are rigid in dealing with petty corruption,--as they

ought to be. An instance occurred recently. A navy clerk caused to be conveyed

to a timber merchant an intimation that for thirty pounds he would get for him

a certain contract to supply timber to one of the navy-yards. Both the clerk

and his messenger were tried for conspiracy to obtain money by false pretences,

and on being convicted were sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment at hard

labor. This was just. But, on the other hand, there is in this same England an

amount and variety of political immorality, particularly among great lords,

capitalists, and corporations, which leaves the United States stainlessly pure

in comparison. We all know what English elections are. The reason why we all

know is, because the corruption at those elections has become an established

jest, which the national humorists, such as Hogarth, Dickens, Thackeray, and

Bulwer, have found available for their art. Through the works of these great

authors we have become perfectly familiar with that corruption, and with the

national average of moral feeling which joyfully accepts the bribing and

debauching of free citizens as a legitimate source of fun. Englishmen urge

foreigners to stay over another steamer on the purpose to witness "the humors

of an English election," as Spaniards detain their guests for the Sunday

bull-fight.<p>



<p>



We may also pass lightly over that long period in the history of England when

every minister bought an essential portion of his majority by bank-notes put

into the hands of members in the house of Commons. "The sums varied," as we

learn from Wraxall, "from five hundred to eight hundred pounds a year," which

sums were "conveyed" to gentlemen of the House of Commons "in a squeeze of the

hand" as they passed the ministerial agent. It was the business of that agent

in Lord Chatham's time "to distribute with ART and POLICY, amongst the members

who had no ostensible place, sums of money for their support during the

session, besides contracts, lottery-tickets, and other douceurs. It is no

uncommon circumstance at the end of a session for a gentleman to receive five

hundred or a thousand pounds for his SERVICE" [See Endnote 2]. There has been

published a letter from an English minister to Cardinal Henry, who was minister

of Louis XV. of France at the beginning of his reign. Here is an edifying

extract: "I pension half the parliament to keep it quiet; but as the king's

money is not sufficient, they to whom I give none clamor loudly for a war. It

would be expedient for your Eminence to remit me three millions of French

livres in order to silence the barkers. Gold is a metal which here corrects all

ill qualities in the blood. A pension of two thousand pounds a year will make

the most impetuous warrior in Parliament as tame as a lamb." [See Endnote 3].

There is also a letter extant, in which Louis XIV. authorizes his minister to

offer the Duke of Marlborough four millions of francs for a peace on certain

conditions. With regard to the peace of 1763, against which Lord Chatham so

eloquently protested, it is known to have been accomplished by the most lavish

expenditure of money and promotion. "The Royal household had been increased

beyond all former example. The lords and grooms of the bedchamber were doubled.

Pensions were thrown about indiscriminately. Five-and-twenty thousand pounds

were issued in one day, in bank-notes of one hundred pounds each. The only

stipulation was, GIVE US YOUR VOTE!....The city of London refused to address

(in favor of peace), although the sum of fourteen thousand pounds was offered

to complete the bridge.....The Lord-Lieutenants had begging-letters sent to

them to use their influence; and five hundred pounds, secret service, were

added to each letter. The sum of five hundred pounds was the notorious price of

an address. Some addresses cost a much larger sum. The sum was regulated

according to the importance and magnitude of the place from which the address

was obtained." [See Endnote 4]. We also read, in the memoirs of that time, of

men holding offices of which they only drew half the salary, "being RODE for

the other half"; and these individuals, both the riders and the ridden, were

not city-clerks and contractors, but men of rank and influence.<p>



<p>



But these things occurred a long time ago,--one hundred and six years,--when

all the world, except Prussia, was corrupt; and Prussia is an empire today

because she was not corrupt then. Since that time England has nobly grappled

with many a hoary abuse, has made important advances toward free trade and

purity of government, and is still pressing onward. And yet we read astounding

things of the venality of the present generation of her ruling class. The

history of railroads in Great Britain appears to be little more than a history

of giant frauds, from the day of honest George Stevenson to that of collapsed

Morton Peto. The English biographer of the Stevensons tells us of a great duke

who caused the defeat of a railroad bill in Parliament, because the engineer

had laid out the line too near one of his Grace's fox covers; of a "party" in a

committee of lords offering to withdraw opposition to a projected road for ten

thousand pounds; of opposition "got up mainly for the purpose of being bought

off"; of railway directors boasting of the number of votes they could "command"

in the House of Commons; of parliamentary log-rolling in the "Yankee" style of

"You help me roll my log, and I'll help you roll yours"; of a railway bill

which it cost the directors eighty-two thousand pounds to get passed; of

another, the total cost of passing which was four hundred and thirty-six

thousand, two hundred and twenty-three pounds, about THREE MILLION DOLLARS of

our present currency; of needy members "conciliated" by being paid five

thousand pounds for a strip of land worth five hundred; of members who

"systematically sold their parliamentary interest for money considerations"; of

an "impoverished nobleman" receiving thirty thousand pounds for a narrow strip

of his estate, the whole of which was not worth more than that sum, and then

selling another corner to another company for a second thirty thousand pounds,

thus getting sixty thousand pounds "damages" for what greatly increased the

value of his property. "Of course," remarks Mr. J.C. Jeafferson, "it was well

understood that the two sums of thirty thousand pounds did not represent the

price of the land, but the price of the peer's parliamentary interest."<p>



<p>



It seems, too, that many of the petty infamies incident to the infancy of

popular government--infamies which we are about to abolish--are in full

activity in England. English politicians have not yet discovered the puerility

of bribing obscure and utterly uninfluential newspapers by lavish advertising.

Advertisements for navy rum were inserted by the last Tory administration in a

little weekly paper, circulating a few hundred copies among clergymen of

conservative politics. Comic papers of the same politics were subscribed for in

considerable numbers for distribution in government asylums. Advertisements

were paid for at rates three or four times higher than the regular price. At

the time of the last general election, as we learn from the Pall mall Gazette,

"an advertising-agent was instructed by a government department to send

advertisements to a certain provincial journal. This journal was so excellent a

medium for the purpose that the agent, whose business it is to know these

things, was quite unaware of its existence. He had to make inquiries as to

whether there was such a newspaper or not. His investigations were successful.

It turned out that the influential and widely circulated print had been started

a few weeks previously to serve the interest of the Tory candidate for the

borough in which it was published. Accordingly, the government advertisements

were sent for the support of the paper; and there we have seen them, column

after column, week after week." The same journal informs mankind that this

extremely primitive, provincial, and generally useless form of bribery is

"rampant" in England, as well as that of giving exclusive news for fulsome

laudation. "In short," adds this able newspaper, "it comes to this: it is the

custom of ministers in England, as well as in foreign parts, to subsidize the

press for their own benefit." But how stupidly they do it! During the recent

general election in England, there was a certain "industrious literary

compiler," named Townsend, who wrote on the D'Israeli side with great diligence

and small effect. He was promised by Mr. D'Israeli, not a petty office in the

custom-house for four years, but a post in the mint for life, worth a thousand

pounds a year; or, if that should not fall vacant, he was to have the still

more lucrative place in the inland revenue held by a brother of the Premier,

whose death was daily expected. But before the vacancy occurred, Mr. D'Israeli

had lost the power to confer such munificent rewards for services so trifling,

and the new ministry, upon the death of Mr. James D'Israeli, had the virtue to

abolish the sinecure he had held so long. The disappointment was too much for

the unhappy writer, who stabbed himself to the heart; an occurrence which led

to the disclosure of the facts. All this is very much in what Englishmen

flatter themselves is the American style: only more so. [See Endnote 5].<p>



<p>



Indeed, they have in England most of the small sins of popular government as

well as all of the great ones. I read in the London papers, at the close of a

session, that the House of Commons, like the House of Representatives, is idle

during the first half of a session; which obliges it to hurry bills through

with such velocity at last, that members can hardly catch their titles, but

merely ascertain whether an act is favored or opposed by the ministry, and vote

accordingly. It appears, also, that ministers cram the public offices with

superfluous clerks, and that absurd and fraudulent charges are covered by that

convenient word, "contingencies." Dr. Russell was in the Crimea lately, and

wrote home to the Times, that "the French and Russian dead have been reverently

gathered together, but the English cemetery on Cathcart's Hill is in a shameful

state, notwithstanding the thirteen thousand pounds paid by the government for

its proper maintenance. The Russian government has done more than could be

expected of it, but all the monuments in the cemetery are being chipped to

pieces, and no attempt has been made to gather the remains of our fallen

soldiers in one spot." There is, also, in England, a "pardon lobby," which can

sometimes get a man of rank released form prison before his term has expired;

as in the United States a forger of wealthy family can occasionally (though

very rarely) procure a similar favor.<p>



<p>



Mr. Froude's recent utterance with regard to the prevalence of fraud in England

would surely be an exaggeration if applied to the United States. It could not

be truly said of the business of America that it is "saturated with fraud." "So

deep has it gone," added the historian, "that a strictly honest tradesman can

hardly hold his ground against competition. You can no longer trust that any

article that you buy is the thing which it pretends to be. We have false

weights, false measures, cheating, and shoddy everywhere. Yet the clergy have

seen all this grow up in absolute indifference; and the great question which at

this moment is agitating the Church of England is the color of the

ecclesiastical petticoats." This is not true of the United States, where, as a

rule, men of business comprehend well, and act upon their belief, that the sole

possible basis of a business permanently great is to give a good dollar's worth

for a dollar. Probably Mr. Froude, like Mr. Carlyle, lives very much among his

books, and does not possess personal knowledge of anything which cannot be

learned in a library. As to the clergy, their existence as a privileged order

is in peril; they are engaged in Mr. Darwin's "struggle for life." Clergymen of

ability, who have several strings to their bow, do not meddle with the

petticoat question.<p>



<p>



There is a poem by Mrs. Browning, written before we had emancipated ourselves

from slavery, in which she told us that the penalty we paid for consenting to

remain under that shameful yoke was that we forfeited the right to glow with

indignation, and hurl the sharp rebuke, at atrocious deeds done anywhere on

earth. In the presence of our own giant iniquity, we must remain silent when we

heard of distant outrage. But the principle to which she gave expression in

this fine poem is, perhaps, of universal application. No nation is so pure that

is can with propriety point the finger of reproach at another; because, if the

sins of one are different from those of the other, it does not follow that they

are less. I do firmly believe that the people of the United States are the most

honest people in the world; but I do not know that we should be such if it were

as hard to live in the United states as it is in the densely peopled and

entirely appropriated countries of the Old World. There was no stealing in the

California mining-region when every man was making his pile. Considering how

much our virtues and our vices are produced by circumstances, it is as

ridiculous to boast as it is vulgar to taunt.<p>



<p>



Why then parade those examples of the weakness and corruption of other

governments? For several reasons. It is comforting to have companions in

misfortune, and it is reassuring to know that governments that were once wholly

corrupt are now but partially so. The court of Louis XIV. and their servants

numbered three thousand persons, and the king carried on his war by the sale of

places. There were lieutenant-colonels then in the French army ten years of

age, and archbishops under twenty-one. It is not so bad as that in France now;

and in England several entire species of corrupt practice have been extirpated.

The tendency of governments to become corrupt is powerful and constant, and

they can be kept endurably honest only by eternal vigilance. Besides, a year or

two since, when the North American Review exposed the government of New York

the English Tories seized the articles with avidity, and caused them to be

republished in England, and circulated as "campaign documents." All the Tory

organs commented upon them, and drew inferences unfavorable to government by

the people for the people; omitting to mention that the corrupt governments of

our three largest sea-ports are sustained by voters whom the Tory system of

Europe had kept in brutal ignorance. If New York aldermen steal, it is because

Great Britain has been governed by a class. Send us intelligent, educated

emigrants, ye supercilious Tories! Send us men trained in the duties of

citizenship, and we will soon expel the thieves from city-hall and lobby. We

shall do it, as it is; but not as soon as we should like.<p>



<p>



After all, we are but serving an apprenticeship in the art of government by the

whole people. We have done very well hitherto. Evils have arisen, but they have

been grappled with and suppressed. Evils exist, but there is no reason to think

that the recuperative energy of the system is near exhaustion. It is only

people who do not know much about the period of Washington and John Adams, who

think the government was better then than it is now. It is better now, upon the

whole, than it was then; and MUCH better, considering how difficult a task

governments now have. In its worst estate, it was better than the best

despotism. Congress, I am sure, will repent of its small sins; and by and by it

will so reorganize the public service that the temptation to commit many of

them will be removed.<p>

1. Since writing this passage, I read the following in an English paper: "The

account of the biddings for the next presentation to the rectory and vicarage

of Westborough and Dry Donnington, in the county of Lincoln, which was put up

to auction at the Mart on Tuesday, certainly offers food for reflection to

thoughtful minds. It appears that the living is worth seven hundred and eight

pounds per annum. There are two churches to serve,--a mile and a half

apart,--service being held alternately at each place, viz. in the morning at

one, and in the evening at the other, and vice versa. There was, the auctioneer

stated, good society; he thought he might add, good hunting, and allowing one

hundred pounds a year to a curate to do the dirty, disagreeable work, such as

attending to the sick and dying, there would remain a net profit of about six

hundred pounds a year for the rector. The outside sum offered for the privilege

of attending to the eternal salvation of the inhabitants of the two parishes in

question was four thousand eight hundred pounds. This did not reach the reserve

price, and accordingly the living was withdrawn, doubtless to the great

disappointment of the young divines with 'a call,' but no ready money."<p>

5. Here is another anecdote of the last general election in England: "Some time

ago a well-educated young Welshman came into possession of a farm left him by

his father, and, being a Liberal in politics, he voted at the last election for

the Liberal candidate. He was in the habit of churning his butter by

water-power, which he obtained from a brook which ran through the land of his

neighbor, a powerful conservative landed proporietor, and member of Parliament.

To punish the young farmer's audacity in voting according to his principles,

the Tory magnate ordered the course of the water to be diverted, so that it

might not be used any longer to churn the Radical farmer's butter. This was

actually done. The famer found one day the water turned from his house, and now

he has to churn his butter by hand."<p>

	<i><font size=4>A college professor looks at the

forgotten victims of our mediocre educational system--the potentially high

achievers whose SAT scores have fallen, and who read less, understand less of

what they read, and know less than the top students of a generation ago.</i></font><p>

	

	

	<pre>

	

	</pre>

	

	<font size=5>T</font>wo crises are stalking American education. Each poses a major threat to the

nation's future. The two are very different in character and will require

separate strategies if we wish to solve them; yet to date, almost without

exception, those concerned with restoring excellence to our schools have lumped

them together.<p>



<p>



The first crisis, which centers on disadvantaged minority children attending

inner-city schools, has received considerable attention, as well it should. Put

simply, it involves students whose habitat makes it very difficult for them to

learn. The key issues are more social than educational. These children clearly

need dedicated teachers and a sound curriculum, the two staples of a quality

school, but the fact remains that most of them will not make significant

progress until they also have decent housing, a better diet, and a safer

environment in which to live.<p>



<p>



The second crisis, in contrast, is far more academic than social and to a

surprising extent invisible. It involves approximately half the country's

student population--the group that educators refer to as "college-bound."

Although the overwhelming majority of these students attend suburban schools, a

fair number can be found in big-city or consolidated rural districts, or in

independent or parochial schools. Beginning in the mid-1970s these students

have been entering college so badly prepared that they have performed far below

potential, often to the point of functional disability. We tend to assume that

with their high aptitude for learning, they should be able to fend for

themselves. However, the experience of the past fifteen years has proved

decisively that they can't.<p>



<p>



For most people, any mention of the problems of American education almost

immediately conjures up an image of the wretched conditions in the

stereotypical urban ghetto school. But can we really explain the sharp decline

in college-entrance-exam scores by pointing to the inner cities, where only a

tiny fraction of students even take the Scholastic Aptitude Test, or SAT? Do so

many freshmen entering prestigious institutions like Harvard and Berkeley

display a limited mastery of basic historical facts, not to mention of their

own language, because they come from crime-ridden neighborhoods or school

districts with no tax base?<p>



<p>



If one looks at the aggregate statistics of American education from this

perspective, the full dimensions of this other crisis become strikingly

apparent. Consider the recent history of the Stanford Achievement Test, which

has long served as one of the main instruments for measuring pupil progress in

our schools. According to Herbert Rudman, a professor of educational psychology

at Michigan State University and a co-author of the test for more than three

decades, from the 1920s to the late 1960s American children taking the Stanford

made significant gains in their test performance. They made so much progress,

in fact, that as the test was revised each decade, the level of difficulty of

the questions was increased substantially, reflecting the increasing level of

challenge of the instructional materials being used in the schools.<p>



<p>



From the late 1960s to the early 1980s, however, we managed to squander the

better part of that progress, with the greatest losses coming in the high

schools. During the past few years the Stanford and other test results have

shown some improvement in math and science, and in language skills at the

elementary school level. But there has been little or no movement in the verbal

areas among junior high and high school students, and seasoned test

interpreters have also seen a tendency for the gains made in the early years of

school to wash out as the child becomes older. In effect, the test numbers

substantiate what the National Commission on Excellence in Education

concluded--quoting the education analyst Paul Copperman--in 1983 in A Nation at

Risk: "Each generation of Americans has outstripped its parents in education,

in literacy, and in economic attainment. For the first time in the history of

our country, the educational skills of one generation will not surpass, will

not equal, will not even approach, those of their parents."<p>



<p>



The blame for this wholesale decline in test scores is often put on a throng of

underachieving minority students thought to have been pulling down national

test averages, but in fact just the opposite is true. To be sure, it is

possible to attribute much of the relatively small initial drop in SAT scores,

from 1963 to 1970, to the fact that blacks and other minorities began taking

the test in larger numbers during those years, but since then the composition

of the test population has not changed in any way that would dramatically

affect test scores. Most important, blacks have made gradual but significant

gains in the past two decades, as measured by school achievement tests like the

Stanford and by college-entrance exams. Although their average scores still

fall substantially below those of whites, their combined (verbal and math) SAT

scores rose by 49 points during the 1980s alone.<p>



<p>



"Perhaps the most untold story of American education in the past few years is

the achievement of black students," Gregory R. Anrig, the president of the

Educational Testing Service, declares. "The hard data are encouraging." The sad

irony, of course, is that this progress came at a time when the Reagan

Administration was proposing drastic cuts in the amount of federal scholarship

aid available to students from low-income families, most likely leading many

young blacks to believe that a college education was not within their reach.<p>



<p>



While students in the bottom quartile have shown slow but steady improvement

since the 1960s, average test scores have nonetheless gone down, primarily

because of the performance of those in the top quartile. This "highest cohort

of achievers," Rudman writes, has shown "the greatest declines across a variety

of subjects as well as across age-level groups." Analysts have also found "a

substantial drop among those children in the middle range of achievement," he

continues, "but less loss and some modest gains at the lower levels." In other

words, our brightest youngsters, those most likely to be headed for selective

colleges, have suffered the most dramatic setbacks over the past two decades--a

fact with grave implications for our ability to compete with other nations in

the future. If this is true--and abundant evidence exists to suggest that it

is--then we indeed have a second major crisis in our education system.<p>



<p>



<p>



SIXTY POINTS LOST ON THE SAT<p>



<p>



Look at what has happened on the SAT, a test that retains its well-deserved

status as the most important educational measuring device in America. Despite

the test's many critics, the number of colleges relying on the SAT keeps

increasing, because it provides such an accurate gauge of the basic skills

needed for college-level work, among them reading comprehension, vocabulary,

and the ability to reason with mathematical concepts. The SAT also has the

virtue of having a rock-steady scoring system: it is calibrated, by the College

Board, so that a score earned in 1991 will represent almost exactly the same

level of performance as it did in, say, 1961. Thus, by tracking the percentage

of students coming in above the benchmark of 600 on the College Board scale

(which runs from 200 to 800), one can get a good sense of how the country's

most capable students have fared over the years.<p>



<p>



The news is not encouraging. In 1972, of the high school seniors taking the SAT

11.4 percent had verbal scores over 600; by 1983 the number had dropped to 6.9

percent, and, despite modest gains in the mid-1980s, it remains in that

disheartening vicinity. That's a decline of nearly 40 percent. The decline

since the mid-1960s has probably been closer to 50 percent, but unfortunately

the College Board changed its reporting system in 1972, and earlier data isn't

available. The math SAT presents a somewhat different story. Though the

percentage scoring over 600 dropped from 17.9 in 1972 to 14.4 by 1981, it has

climbed back up to 17.9 in 1991. However, an influx of high-scoring

Asian-American students (who now make up eight percent of those taking the

test, as compared with two percent in 1972) has apparently had much to do with

this recent upsurge.<p>



<p>



To grasp what these national figures really mean, it helps to approach them

from the standpoint of the individual student. How, we should ask, would the

drop in SAT scores affect a typical top-quartile senior at a well-regarded

suburban high school in 1991? To my knowledge, no published studies have

addressed this question, but the available information, including my own

research, suggests that our hypothetical senior would come in roughly fifty to

sixty points lower on the verbal section and twenty-five points lower on the

math than he or she would have in 1970.<p>



<p>



Consider the trend in average freshman scores at selective colleges. Indeed,

perusing a twenty-year-old edition of Barron's Profiles of American Colleges is

an experience equivalent to entering a different world, with tuitions much

lower and SAT scores much higher than at most schools today. In 1970 students

arriving at top-ranked institutions like Columbia College, Swarthmore College,

the University of Chicago, and Pomona College posted average verbal SATs from

670 to 695; by the mid-1980s the scores ranged from 620 to 640, and they have

stayed roughly in that neighborhood ever since. The same pattern appears at

colleges a notch or two lower in the academic hierarchy. To take a few examples

from different geographic areas, from 1970 to 1987 average verbal scores went

from 644 to 570 at Hamilton College, from 607 to 563 at Washington University,

from 600 to 560 at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and from 560 to 499

at the University of California at Santa Barbara.<p>



<p>



The point is not that these particular schools have slipped in their relative

standings. They all currently receive ratings the same as or higher than those

they received twenty years ago from Barron's in terms of competition for

admission. One could pick almost any selective institution at random and find

the same trend (an exception: the stronger schools in the South, where test

scores held steady or rose in the wake of desegregation). Nor can one attribute

the drop in scores to a change in the size of the test population or in the

percentage of high school seniors taking the SAT (the latter figure has risen

significantly only in the past few years, too recently to have affected the

1987 scores). To be sure, an increase in the number of minority students

attending these institutions has been a factor, but the basic problem remains:

with a 40 percent decline in the proportion of students scoring over 600, there

are far fewer high-scoring students to go around.<p>



<p>



But do these numbers matter? Does a loss of sixty points on the verbal SAT

translate into a significant difference in a student's educational experience

at college? The testimony of those who teach at the college level suggests that

the answer is yes. When a national poll in 1989 asked professors whether they

thought undergraduates were "seriously underprepared in basic skills," 75

percent said yes and only 15 percent said no. The same poll asked whether

institutions of higher learning were spending "too much time and money teaching

students what they should have learned in high school." Sixty-eight percent

said yes. Professors feel like this, I should add, not because they are old

scolds given to grousing about students but because their work brings them into

daily contact with the manifold ways in which the American education system has

failed these young people.<p>



<p>



Those who tend to dismiss those sixty lost SAT points as insignificant haven't

seen a college term paper lately. It's not that freshmen in 1991 are unable to

read or write. Most of them possess what the National Assessment of Educational

Progress calls "satisfactory" skills in this area. But is that enough for

college? Do they have sufficient command of the English language to comprehend

a college-level text, think through a complex issue, or express a reasonably

sophisticated argument on paper? Those of us who were teaching in the early

1970s can attest that the overwhelming majority of freshmen at the more

selective colleges arrived with such "advanced" skills. Now only a handful come

so equipped.<p>



<p>



<p>



THE CONTEXT OF IGNORANCE<p>



<p>



Take reading, for example. "While the nation's students have the skills to

derive a surface understanding of what they read," the<p>



NAEP recently reported, "they have difficulty when asked to defend or elaborate

upon this surface understanding." That's what most college faculty would say.

Emilia da Costa, a Latin America specialist who has taught at Yale for the past

eighteen years, estimates that whereas 70 percent of her students can pick out

the general theme of an essay or a book, only 25 percent come away with

in-depth comprehension of what they read. David Samson, a former lecturer in

history and literature at Harvard, likewise observes, "No one reads for nuance.

They pay no attention to detail." My own experience confirms this. Countless

times I have been amazed at how little students have managed to glean from a

book I know they have read, to the point where they are often unable to recall

the names of prominently mentioned figures. So much escapes them; even those of

above-average ability absorb no more than a dusting of detail from a printed

text. And without such detailed information it's impossible for them to gain a

real understanding of what the author is saying.<p>



<p>



Equally distressing is the rate at which today's students read. A friend of

mine at the University of Michigan remembers that in the 1960s the normal

assignment in his courses was one book a week. Now he allows two to three weeks

for each title. He has also reluctantly had to adjust the level of difficulty

of his assignments: even a journalist like Walter Lippmann is too hard for most

freshmen and sophomores these days, he finds. Again, this is typical. Twelve to

fifteen books over a fifteen-week semester used to be the rule of thumb at

selective colleges. Today it is six to eight books, and they had better be

short texts, written in relatively simple English.<p>



<p>



As one might expect, students who don't read at an advanced level can't write

well either. Their knowledge of grammar is not bad, according to Richard

Marius, the director of the expository writing program at Harvard, but "the

number of words available to express their thoughts is very, very limited, and

the forms by which they express themselves are also very limited." The average

incoming Harvard student, he observes, has a "utilitarian command of language"

resulting in sentences that follow a simple subject-predicate,

subject-predicate format with little variation or richness of verbal

expression. Harvard, of course, gets the cream of the crop. Those of us

teaching at lesser institutions would be happy with utilitarian but serviceable

prose from our freshmen. More often we get mangled sentences, essays composed

without the slightest sense of paragraphing, and writing that can't sustain a

thought for more than half a page.<p>



<p>



Along with this impoverishment of language comes a downturn in reasoning

skills. Da Costa laments that students are no longer trained in logical

analysis, and consequently have difficulty using evidence to reach a

conclusion. R. Jackson Wilson finds this to be the greatest change he has

observed during a quarter century of teaching history at Smith College.

"Students come to us having sat around for twelve years expressing attitudes

toward things rather than analyzing," he says. "They are always ready to tell

you how they feel about an issue, but they have never learned how to construct

a rational argument to defend their opinions." Again, these complaints are

amply substantiated by data from the National Assessment of Educational

Progress. On one test of analytic writing measuring "the ability to provide

evidence, reason logically, and make a well-developed point," only four tenths

of one percent of eleventh graders performed at the "elaborated" (what I

believe should be considered college-freshman) level.<p>



<p>



Finally, no account of the present condition of college students would be

complete without mention of the extraordinary dearth of factual knowledge they

bring to college. Horror stories on this topic abound--and they are probably

all true. I will never forget two unusually capable juniors, one of whom was a

star political-science major, who came to my office a few years ago to ask what

was this thing called the New Deal. I had made reference to it during a lecture

on the assumption that everyone in the class would be well acquainted with

Franklin Roosevelt's domestic program, but I was wrong: the two students had

checked with their friends, and none of them had heard of the New Deal either.

Another junior recently asked me to help him pick a twentieth-century American

novelist on whom to write a term paper. He had heard vaguely of F. Scott

Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, but did not recognize the names of Sinclair

Lewis, John Dos Passos, Norman Mailer, William Styron, and Saul Bellow.<p>



<p>



Indeed, one can't assume that college students know anything anymore. Paula

Fass, a professor of history at the University of California at Berkeley,

remains astonished that sophomores and juniors in her upper-level course on

American social history are often unable to differentiate between the American

Revolution and the Civil War, but rather see them as two big events that

happened way back in the past. Alan Heimert, a veteran member of the Harvard

English department, encounters the same mushy grasp of historical knowledge and

blames it on the "trendy social-studies curriculum" now taught in most high

schools which covers broad thematic topics rather than history. "They are aware

that someone oppressed someone else," he says with only slight exaggeration,

"but they aren't sure exactly what took place and they have no idea of the

order in which it happened."<p>



<p>



Though not always recognized, a direct connection exists between this deficit

in factual knowledge and the decline in verbal skills. Most reading, after all,

is at bottom a form of information processing in which the mind selects what it

wants to know from the printed page and files it away for future use. In

conducting that operation of selecting, interpreting, and storing information,

the reader constantly relies on his or her previous stock of knowledge as a

vital frame of reference. No matter how fascinating or valuable a new detail

might be, a person finds it almost impossible to hold in memory and have

available for retrieval unless it can be placed in some kind of larger context.

Providing that basic intellectual scaffolding used to be a major function of a

good high school education. Year-long survey courses in history and literature,

covering the United States, Europe, and the world, were designed to ensure that

college-bound students would have the necessary background to make sense of the

new subject matter they would encounter in college. Yet few high schools today

teach that kind of curriculum.<p>



<p>



Little wonder that so many students experience great difficulty in absorbing

detail; since they have no context in which to fit what they read, it quickly

flows out of their minds. Unable to retain much, they find little profit in

reading, which leads them to read less, which in turn makes it harder for them

to improve their reading skills.<p>



<p>



One often hears this generation accused of laziness. They don't perform well in

school or college or later on the job, it is said, because they lack

motivation. I don't happen to subscribe to that theory. The percentage of

students who are truly lazy--that is, who simply have an aversion to work--is

probably no greater today than it has been in the past. The real problem, I'm

convinced, is that college-bound youngsters over the past two decades have not

received the quality education they deserve. As R. Jackson Wilson observes of

his students at Smith, this generation is typically "good-spirited,

refreshingly uncowed by teachers' authority, and very willing to work." They

enter college with high ambitions, only to find those ambitions dashed in many

cases by inadequate skills and knowledge. The normal activities required to

earn a bachelor's degree--reading, writing, researching, and reasoning--are so

difficult for them that a large number (I would guess a majority at most

schools) simply give up in frustration. Some actually leave; the rest go

through the motions, learning and contributing little, until it's time to pick

up their diplomas. We rightly worry about the nation's high school dropouts.

Perhaps we should worry as well about these silent college "dropouts."<p>



<p>



<p>



HOW GOOD SCHOOLS BUCK THE TREND<p>



<p>



What has caused this great decline in our schools? The multitude of reports

that now fill the library shelves tend to designate "social factors" as the

prime culprit. Television usually heads the list, followed by rock music, the

influence of adolescent peer groups, the increase in both single-parent

families and households where both parents work, and even faulty nutrition.<p>



<p>



Those who attribute the loss of academic performance to social factors don't

take account of the small number of high schools around the country that have

managed to escape the downturn. Some are posh private academies; a few are

located in blue-collar neighborhoods. What they have in common is a pattern of

stable or even rising test scores at a time when virtually all the schools

around them experienced sharp declines. There is no indication that the

children attending these exceptional schools watched significantly fewer hours

of television, listened to less heavy-metal music, were less likely to have

working mothers, or ate fewer Big Macs than other children. Rather, they appear

to have had the good fortune to go to schools that were intent on steering a

steady course in a time of rapid change, thus countering the potentially

negative impact of various social factors.<p>



<p>



It would seem obvious good sense to look closely at this select group of

schools to determine what they have been doing right, but as far as I can

determine this has been done in only two national studies. The better one was

issued by the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) in

1978, under the somewhat pedestrian title Guidelines for Improving SAT Scores.

Now out of print and hard to find, it contains one of the most perceptive

diagnoses available of the underlying malady in our schools.<p>



<p>



The report identifies one main characteristic that successful schools have

shared--the belief that academics must invariably receive priority over every

other activity. "The difference comes," we are told, "from a singular

commitment to academic achievement for the college-bound student." These

schools did not ignore the other dimensions of student life. By and large, the

NASSP found, schools that maintained excellence in academics sought to be

excellent in everything else they did, they "proved to be apt jugglers, keeping

all important balls in the air." But academic work came first.<p>



<p>



Two other factors help account for the prowess of these schools in holding the

line against deterioration. The first is a dogged reliance on a traditional

liberal-arts curriculum. In an era of mini-courses and electives, the tiny

group of high schools that kept test scores and achievement high continued to

require year-long courses in literature and to encourage enrollment in rigorous

math classes, including geometry and advanced algebra. Though the learning

environment in those schools was often "broad and imaginative," in the words of

the NASSP, fundamentals such as English grammar and vocabulary received heavy

stress. The other key factor in preserving academic quality was the practice of

grouping students by ability in as many subjects as possible The contrast was

stark: schools that had "severely declining test scores" had "moved

determinedly toward heterogeneous grouping" (that is, mixed students of

differing ability levels in the same classes), while the "schools who have

maintained good SAT scores" tended "to prefer homogeneous grouping."<p>



<p>



If attaining educational excellence is this simple, why have these high-quality

schools become so rare? The answer lies in the cultural ferment of the 1960s.<p>



<p>



<p>



THE INCUBUS OF THE SIXTIES<p>



<p>



In every conceivable fashion the reigning ethos of those times was hostile to

excellence in education. Individual achievement fell under intense suspicion,

as did attempts to maintain standards. Discriminating among students on the

basis of ability or performance was branded "elitist." Educational gurus of the

day called for essentially nonacademic schools, whose main purpose would be to

build habits of social cooperation and equality rather than to train the mind.

A good education, it was said, maximized the child's innate spontaneity,

creativity, and affection for others. To the extent that logic and acquired

knowledge interfered with that process, they were devalued.<p>



<p>



This populist tidal wave receded by the late 1970s, but the mediocrity it left

in its wake remains. The extent of the devastation has varied by subject area:

math and the natural sciences, which continue to be blessed with relatively

widespread agreement on what should be taught, have escaped the worst damage

(though test scores in these areas still fall below average in comparisons with

scores in other industrialized nations), while English and history now lie in

ruins in all too many schools. The latter, of course, are the disciplines

primarily responsible for inculcating verbal skills and for supplying the broad

framework of knowledge that students need for success in college. Yet it is

precisely in these areas that the spirit of the sixties remains most evident,

hovering over the high schools and junior highs like a ghost.<p>



<p>



Consider the teaching of English. The Great Books, of course, are out of

fashion. A few get assigned as a token gesture, but are rarely set in

chronological order. The results of a questionnaire I recently distributed at

Hobart and William Smith Colleges suggest that less than a quarter of the

college-bound population now gets a real year-long survey of American

literature, with probably no more than 15 percent taking such a course in

British or European literature. Instead, students all too often are given works

that, as the English department at one highly ranked independent school puts

it, are "age-appropriate" and "reflect [a] concern for social pluralism."

"Age-appropriate" means giving students assignments "that reflect their

interests as adolescents, that they can read without constant recourse to a

dictionary, and from which they can take whatever they are inspired to take."<p>



<p>



Nor are they asked to read much. Most ninth- and tenth-grade English reading

lists are limited to four or five titles a year. According to Arthur N.

Applebee, the director of the National Research Center on Literature Teaching

and Learning, the typical college-bound high school student reads only

sixty-five pages a week (even with Advanced Placement courses factored in), or

less than ten pages a night. A check of the typical high school curriculum

would disclose that plays are favorite choices these days (they tend to be much

shorter than novels and make easier reading), along with personal memoirs. The

rich diet of fiction and poetry that used to be served up--Dickens, Twain, Poe,

Hawthorne, Shakespeare, Chaucer, Thoreau, Dickinson, Milton, Melville, and

Steinbeck--is increasingly hard to find.<p>



<p>



These changes in the teaching of literature matter greatly because reading is

the primary vehicle by which students absorb the rhythms and patterns of

language. The more a person encounters sophisticated prose, the more he or she

will pick up varied sentence structure, vocabulary in context, and even

spelling, as well as advanced descriptive techniques and narrative strategies.

Feed a student the literary equivalent of junk food and you will get an

impoverished command of English, which is what we too often see in the current

crop of college freshmen. And yet, because most new teachers these days are

themselves the product of this new English curriculum, the trend continues to

run the wrong way.<p>



<p>



The rest of the English curriculum also reflects the impact of the sixties. If

the reports I get from my students are accurate, it would appear that formal

drills on grammar, vocabulary, spelling, and diction are infrequent these days.

Teachers may toss an occasional drill into the schedule to keep parents

satisfied, but the assumption is that students will absorb these things

automatically from their reading. Given what students currently read, however,

that's a dubious assumption. As for writing, when it is assigned (there seems

to be wide variation among schools on this), it tends to take the form of

"personal expression"--with assignments calling for first-person narratives

that describe what the student has seen, felt, or experienced. Essays in which

the writer marshals evidence to support a coherent, logical argument are all

too rare. Since that kind of exercise might dampen creativity, it must be

minimized. The outcome is utterly predictable. "Analytic writing was difficult

for students in all grades," the National Assessment of Educational Progress

noted in summarizing the results of its various writing tests in 1984, while

students "had less difficulty with tasks requiring short responses based on

personal experience."<p>



<p>



In sum, this is a generation whose members may be better equipped to track the

progress of their souls in diaries than any group of Americans since the

Puritans. But as for writing papers in college, or later producing the sorts of

documents that get the world's work done, that's another story. In contrast, a

survey conducted by the Educational Testing Service in the mid-1960s, just

before countercultural innovations swept away the old curriculum, discovered

that over twice as many high school students of that era said that they

"frequently" wrote papers criticizing the literary works they were studying (a

valuable pedagogic strategy because it forces the student to become a much

closer reader) as said that they "frequently" wrote papers based on personal

experience.<p>



<p>



<p>



THE SHOCK OF COLLEGE-LEVEL DEMANDS<p>



<p>



The same tendency appears in other key subjects. Students headed for college

used to get a solid grasp of both American and European history at the high

school level. Now, as most people are aware, they pass through an array of

social-studies courses designed to impress upon them the central values of the

sixties, including concern for the natural environment, respect for people of

different racial and ethnic groups, and women's rights. These values are

important and should certainly be included in the curriculum. But teaching them

in such a superficial manner, devoid of any historical context, simply doesn't

work--as the alarming increase in racist and sexist incidents that has plagued

college campuses in the past few years would suggest. Above all, this spotty

social-studies approach deprives students of that vital base of in-depth

knowledge they must have to succeed as undergraduates.<p>



<p>



Accompanying this pervasive dumbing-down of the curriculum has been a wholesale

change in school philosophy. In place of "stretching" students, the key

objective in previous eras, the goal has become not to "stress" them. One hears

again and again that kids growing up "need time to smell the roses." (That they

are more likely to spend their free hours in front of a television or cruising

a shopping mall seems never to be considered.) Placing serious academic demands

on them, it is thought, might impede their natural development and perhaps even

render them neurotic. But the stress they avoid in high school often comes back

to haunt them in college. An extensive survey of college freshmen recently

found that an increasing number say they are "overwhelmed by all I have to do."

"We have very high suicide rates among college students now," the survey's

director, Alexander Astin, says. This should come as no surprise: having had

little previous experience with stress, students are not well equipped to face

the normal and necessary pressures of either college or the "real world."<p>



<p>



Perhaps most crucial, the sixties mentality, with its strong animus against

what it defines as "elitism," has shifted the locus of concern in American

education from high to low achievers. All over the country educators today

typically judge themselves by how well they can reach the least-able student in

the system, the slowest one in the class. Programs to help the culturally

disadvantaged and the learning-disabled have proliferated, while those for the

gifted receive no more than token interest.<p>



<p>



The prevailing ideology holds that it is much better to give up the prospect of

excellence than to take the chance of injuring any student's self-esteem.

Instead of trying to spur children on to set high standards for themselves,

teachers invest their energies in making sure that slow learners do not come to

think of themselves as failures. These attitudes have become so ingrained that

in conversations with teachers and administrators one often senses a virtual

prejudice against bright students. There is at times an underlying feeling,

never articulated, that such children start off with too many advantages, and

that it would be just as well to hold them back until their less fortunate

contemporaries catch up with them. At a minimum, the assumption goes, students

of above-average ability will in due course find their way to classy colleges

and thus don't need any special consideration from their schools.<p>



<p>



In adopting this posture, one must remember, the education profession has

simply been carrying out its social mandate. In the wake of the sixties the

country seemed to be telling the schools that the prime mission now was to

produce equality rather than excellence--to lift up those on the bottom,

whether they were there because of race, class, ethnicity, or low ability. As

the test scores tell us, the education establishment took this mission to

heart. Those in the bottom quartile have shown slow but steady progress, while

those in the top quartile have exhibited a sharp decline. Only since the

appearance of A Nation at Risk, in 1983, with its warning about "a rising tide

of mediocrity" sweeping over the schools, have we started to realize the

sizable hidden cost that this currant educational strategy has exacted.<p>



<p>



Here it is necessary to be precise: the problem is not the pursuit of equality

as such but the bias against excellence that has accompanied it. If anything,

the effort to help children who start off life severely handicapped by their

socioeconomic circumstances deserves more money and attention than it has

received to date. However, that effort need not and must not obscure from view

the quite separate problem of restoring academic quality to our schools. If

real change is to occur in this regard, we must make clear to teachers and

administrators that their mandate has been revised--that we want to move toward

social equality AND academic excellence.<p>



<p>



<p>



FOUR REMEDIES<p>



<p>



Most of the reform proposals currently on the table fail to speak to the other

crisis in American education. The majority are designed to raise minimum

standards or to cut the high school dropout rate. To the extent that

higher-level academics gets mentioned, the discussion usually centers on such

topics as critical-thinking and "process writing" skills and cooperative

learning groups, as if a few minor adjustments in technique could make a

significant difference. Almost no one addresses the fundamental, substantive

issues that must be dealt with if we really want to restore excellence to our

schools.<p>



<p>



If that IS our objective--if we are determined to recover the ground we have

lost since 1970--then we should take the following concrete steps:<p>



<p>



1) Dramatically increase the quality and quantity of assigned reading for

students at all grade levels. By the senior year of high school, college-bound

students should be reading the equivalent of at least twelve books a year FOR

CLASS, not counting textbooks, along with six to eight additional books under

the rubrics of independent and summer reading. To build up to this amount, the

reading load should be adjusted in each of the preceding grades so that

students become gradually accustomed to reading more each year. (A good rule of

thumb might be to have college-bound students read the same number of books

each year as their grade number--eight books in the eighth grade, nine books in

the ninth, and so on.) Since reading is a learned skill that can almost

invariably be improved by practice, the sheer number of pages counts--the more

the better. But there should also be an effort to make the assigned texts as

complex and challenging as possible. In the end, nothing builds a true command

of language faster than this kind of regimen.<p>



<p>



I can already hear a chorus of educators declaring this proposal to be utterly

unworkable. "Kids just don't read anymore," they will say. But the fact is that

this sort of reading load, which was standard in the best American schools a

quarter century ago, is still standard in some schools today. At McDonogh, an

independent school just outside Baltimore that enrolls college-bound students

from a wide range of ability levels, fifteen to twenty assigned books a year in

English class is not unusual for eleventh and twelfth graders. College

admissions officers I know rave about how well prepared McDonogh graduates are

and how enthusiastic about learning. The secret, I'm convinced, is in the

reading. I see no reason why other schools can't follow McDonogh's example.<p>



<p>



2) Bring back required survey courses as the staple of the high school

humanities curriculum. There are many different ways to do this. My preference

would be to have one year of coordinated courses in history and English focused

on the United States, another year focused on Europe, and a third year devoted

to the non-European world. Issues of race and gender would naturally arise; it

is hard, for instance, to cover American literature without including black and

women writers, or to discuss our past without spending considerable time on

slavery and segregation. But the main purpose of this curriculum would be to

ensure that students enter college with a firm knowledge of how the world they

will inherit has developed.<p>



<p>



3) Institute a flexible program of ability grouping at both the elementary and

secondary school levels. Few issues in education can raise tempers faster than

ability grouping, and few are more badly misunderstood. The most common error

is to confuse ability grouping with "tracking," a practice in which students

are sorted out at an early age according to their scores on intelligence tests

and placed in separate "tracks" for fast, medium, and slow learners, where they

remain through high school. Reformers in the 1960s rightly objected to that

kind of predestination, pointing out that minority and working-class children

were often routinely put in the slow track and thus deprived of the chance to

advance themselves through schooling. But unfortunately this assault on

tracking soon broadened to include ability grouping, a somewhat murky term that

I would contend should be defined as a system for dividing students up on the

basis of their actual performance in individual subjects. Under ability

grouping a student might start off in the fast group in math but the slow one

in English, with the placements changing from year to year depending on his or

her progress. The guiding principle is not to give privileged treatment to any

one group but rather to provide instruction closely tailored to the learning

needs of each child.<p>



<p>



Does ability grouping work? The research can supply whatever verdict one

favors. Until roughly the mid-1960s most of the studies tended to show that

ability grouping was beneficial. Then came the cultural revolution of the late

1960s. For the next two decades researchers found that ability grouping was

damaging to most students, especially those at the bottom. The pendulum now

seems to be swinging back the other way, with a number of recent investigators

suggesting that such grouping does not harm anyone and can be of great value to

those of above-average ability, provided they get a special curriculum that is

truly challenging rather than simply moving through the standard curriculum at

a faster pace. Moreover, these newer studies suggest that ability grouping may

actually enhance the achievement of slower learners if they, too, are given a

curriculum and teaching style specially designed for them. A unique program at

South Mecklenburg High School, in Charlotte, North Carolina, has even found

that ability grouping can significantly help those in the middle ability range,

though once again the crucial element is instruction tailored to their needs.<p>



<p>



Since the research is contradictory, perhaps the best way to decide the issue

is to apply common sense. It is obvious that with children of different ability

levels in the same classroom, everything will tend toward a level just a notch

above the lowest common denominator. Instead of being challenged to develop

their talents to the fullest, the most capable students will be forced to work,

in effect, at half speed. The math problems set before them will require little

effort on their part to solve; the English texts will not stretch them in the

least. As a result, these students quickly discover that there is no reason for

them ever to extend themselves, that they can coast through school with minimal

effort.<p>



<p>



Ability grouping continues to face formidable political opposition; last year,

regrettably, the education task force of the National Governors' Association

took its first major step by denouncing it (though its statement was so brief

that one has difficulty telling whether it opposes ability grouping or

tracking). Thus compromises may be in order. One possibility is the system of

intensive courses adopted by the Waynflete School, in Portland, Maine. An

intensive section in English entails a heavier than normal load of reading in

more-advanced texts, more-sophisticated writing assignments, and faster-paced

instruction. The key is that all students are free to try an intensive section;

there is no teacher placement involved. Those doing so run little risk: since

the curriculum includes the same core material covered in a regular section,

students unable to handle the demands can drop back at any time during the

school year.<p>



<p>



This arrangement has several advantages. One is that the "regular" sections are

truly regular, rather than "slow" or "remedial," so that those enrolled in them

feel no stigma whatsoever. Better yet, students who voluntarily contract to be

in a special section are especially motivated. Administrators at Waynflete

report being pleasantly surprised at the number of kids with middle-range

academic ability who perform well in intensive sections because they enjoy the

challenge. And of course, this is a reform that can be implemented with

relatively little disruption to other programs and at virtually no extra

expense. It seems clear that more schools should be trying this system, yet to

date, so far as I can tell, it remains unique to Waynflete.<p>



<p>



4) Attract more bright college graduates into the teaching profession. It is

astonishing, but all too true, that the average verbal SAT score of the young

people drawn into teaching has hovered around 400 for more than a decade. "Half

of the newly employed mathematics, science, and English teachers are not

qualified to teach these subjects," bemoaned A Nation at Risk. Clearly, if we

want top-notch instruction for college-bound students in the years ahead, we

must find a new supply of capable teachers.<p>



<p>



To the familiar prescriptions of offering much higher pay and better working

conditions I would add that it's time to abolish certification requirements for

teachers, at least above the elementary school level. When they first came into

being, those requirements served the important purpose of helping to raise

standards, but today their only function is to discourage talented would-be

teachers from entering the profession. Indeed, certification actually serves to

lower standards: instead of acquiring a thoroughgoing knowledge of their

subject, future teachers spend far too much of their time in college and

graduate school taking Mickey Mouse courses on how to construct a lesson plan.

Private schools do not require certification, yet they manage to attract a

teaching corps of much higher quality--even at lower salaries than the public

schools pay. "Our teachers never learned how to teach, which is why they teach

so well," quips Laurance Levy, the former head of McDonogh's first-rate English

department.<p>



<p>



My impression is that many in the top quartile of the class at our best

colleges would flood into teaching if they could do so on the basis of a

liberal-arts bachelor's degree--and if they could avoid the kind of stifling

bureaucratic control that is all too often a teacher's lot today. Some states,

including New Jersey, have experimented with letting young teachers of this

description loose in their classrooms, apparently with much success, though,

alas, these new teachers are eventually required to obtain certification. And

programs at various selective private colleges and universities permit would-be

teachers to combine a liberal-arts degree and professional training. But for

the most part the cumbersome, outdated apparatus of the teaching profession

remains in place.<p>



<p>



The solution? While it is probably not politically possible in most states to

dismantle the existing system in the near future, why not set up a parallel

system to provide an alternate career path for new teachers? Those liberal-arts

college graduates choosing the new path would go straight to the classroom and

be exempt from all formal professional training. They would, however, have

more-experienced teachers in their schools serving as their mentors. Attracting

these people into the profession would necessitate a much higher pay scale but

also something more. When I recently asked a group of exceptionally capable

students at my college if they would consider a teaching career along these

lines, three quarters at first said yes, but soon reversed themselves. They had

witnessed the demeaning conditions under which most teachers work, they

explained, and wouldn't want the job even if salaries were more appealing. The

only way to lure them into the classroom, it became clear, would be to give

them considerable freedom to shape their own curricula, allow them to choose

instructional materials, and spare them the petty annoyances like the

ubiquitous loudspeaker announcements that can suddenly disrupt a class. If the

governors really want to do something useful to upgrade education, establishing

this alternative career path is perhaps the most valuable project they could

take up.<p>



<p>



<p>



A MORAL ISSUE<p>



<p>



The other crisis in American education has ominous implications for the

well-being of our political system. According to a recent study by the Times

Mirror Center for the People and the Press, titled "The Age of Indifference,"

young Americans aged eighteen to twenty-nine are remarkably uninformed. They do

read, the survey found, but primarily lightweight publications like People

rather than serious newspapers or periodicals. Most striking, a majority of

these young adults report that they often first become aware of political

candidates from television commercials. This response cuts across all

educational levels: college graduates and high school dropouts alike displayed

a troubling ignorance of political facts and a reliance on sound-bites as their

basic source of political knowledge. The "limited appetites and aptitudes" of

this generation, the Times Mirror Center concluded, are already adversely

affecting "the practice of politics and the nature of our democracy."<p>



<p>



One could advance a host of reasons--economic, social, and cultural--why this

other crisis in education needs immediate attention. But in the end the most

important is probably moral, having to do with the responsibility of each

generation to look after the well-being of its children. Observing the

performance of students who have been arriving at college campuses over the

past decade, one can only conclude that the present generation of American

parents has been failing in its obligation to provide its offspring with a

high-quality education. It seems safe to predict that this failure will have

specific consequences in a lower sense of professional fulfillment for these

youngsters as they pursue their careers, and will hamper their ability to stay

competitive with contemporaries in many European and Asian countries, where

college-bound students typically do get the benefit of first-rate schools. Is

it right or sensible to place our children at such a strong disadvantage before

they even begin their adult lives?<p>



<p>



As the United Negro College Fund aptly puts it, a mind is a terrible thing to

waste. It's time to recognize that we have been wasting far too many good ones.

<font size=5>R</font>ICHARD Schroeder was five when he moved into the new 

house.  It had a big back yard that opened up into the tall grass of the 

dunes--his own private slice of the Oregon coast.  He played there almost 

every day until he was ten or eleven.  Then his father began taking him to 

play golf.  Richard loved the game, and was soon working as a caddy at the 

country club.  In college he won several regional amateur tournaments.  

After graduation he went into the securities business, but he still played 

whenever he could.  And he kept thinking about the land behind his parents' 

house.  The rippling dunes, the smell of the surf--he could create a 

world-class golf course, eighteen holes as good as Pebble Beach, right 

there in Gearhart, Oregon.  People would come from thousands of miles away 

just to play on his course.<P>



Dropping out of securities, he spent the mid-1970s working as a club pro, 

learning the golf trade. He also learned the development business. For the 

scheme to be profitable, the course had to be built in conjunction with a 

destination resort--a mixture of hotel and residential space. Schroeder 

was looking at a $100 million project. The acreage was split into a dozen 

parcels, each with a separate owner. Schroeder got them all behind the 

scheme and found a backer who would build it and a famous golf-course 

designer who would lay it out. All this took ten years--a long time, but 

Schroeder knew that dreams do not come true easily. Only in 1986, he says, 

did he learn about the "butterfly problem."<P>

Schroeder was hardly planning to build on pristine wilderness. Part of the 

site is fenced off for cow pasture; the rest, to his annoyance, is strewn 

with beer cans and the tracks of four-wheel-drive vehicles. But the land 

is also one of the few remaining habitats for the rare Oregon silverspot 

butterfly (Speyeria zerene hippolyta). A finger-sized reddish-brown 

insect, S.z. hippolyta is registered as a threatened species under the 

Endangered Species Act of 1973, which directs the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 

Service, a branch of the Department of the Interior, to maintain a list of 

species that are either endangered (in imminent peril of becoming extinct) 

or threatened (likely to become endangered in the near future) and to fine 

or imprison people who "harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, 

trap, capture, or collect" species on the list. Fines, jail--all at once 

Schroeder was in different territory. In addition to the usual obstacles 

facing developers (lawsuits, permits, bonding agents), he would now have 

to guarantee that his golf course could be built without killing a single 

Oregon silverspot butterfly.<P>

The Endangered Species Act first gained notoriety in 1978, when the 

Supreme Court stopped work on an almost finished dam in Tennessee because 

it menaced a little-known fish. Since then the act has reached its long 

fingers into many aspects of American life. The Fish and Wildlife Service 

has forced the cancellation of one dam, in Colorado, because it put 

whooping cranes at risk; pushed the Bureau of Reclamation to postpone 

expanding another, because it jeopardized the humpbacked chub; induced 

Massachusetts to close beaches just north of Boston at the height of 

summer, to protect the piping plover; started a lengthy political battle 

by proposing to settle packs of gray wolves in western states; sent a 

warning to 600 landowners in Polk and Highlands counties, Florida, 

spelling out the consequences if the development of their property harms 

the Florida scrub jay; and hauled the town of Ranchos Palos Verdes, 

California, into criminal court for inadvertently driving the endangered 

Palos Verdes butterfly into apparent extinction, in part by turning one of 

its major breeding grounds into a baseball field (the suit was thrown out 

on a technicality).<P>

None of this comes cheap. Buying land for the Mississippi sandhill crane 

has cost more than $20 million. Riverside County, California, is spending 

an equal sum on the Stephens' kangaroo rat, and would have authorized an 

additional $100 million had voters not rejected the idea. Voters will not 

get the chance to refuse in the Pacific Northwest, where the Fish and 

Wildlife Service plans to save the northern spotted owl, a native of 

forests in Washington, Oregon, and California, by halting most logging on 

8.2 million acres, an area nearly the size of Massachusetts and 

Connecticut combined. Some estimates of the cost of locking up the timber 

reach into the tens of billions of dollars. In the case of the California 

gnat-catcher, now proposed for the endangered-species list, the costs may 

rise even higher, for the bird lives in Los Angeles, and efforts to save 

it will require clamping down on the most powerful real

estate market in the nation.<P>

Richard Schroeder worked diligently to accommodate S.z. hippolyta. He met 

with the silverspot recovery team, the group of scientists and Fish and 

Wildlife Service staffers in charge of the butterfly's future. He hired 

the world's expert on the insect, Paul Hammond, of Oregon State 

University, to put together an official lepidopterist-certified 

conservation plan for the Fish and Wildlife Service. But all came to 

naught. Last March, Hammond found an additional patch of butterfly 

habitat. Exasperated, Schroeder's financial backers pulled the plug--it 

seemed they would never know where the butterfly might turn up next. When 

we visited Schroeder last summer, he was a deeply frustrated man. "The 

whole thing's crazy," he said, shaking his head. He seemed to be trying to 

control his anger. Society had chosen an insect over the dream of a human 

being, and for the life of him Schroeder couldn't see the logic in it, or 

how anyone was better off for it.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<B>THE NOAH PRINCIPLE</B><P>



<font size=5>T</font>HE endangered species act is up for reauthorization this year, and tales 

like Schroeder's are why a political brawl has already begun. Most 

Americans would be appalled if a shopping center wiped out the last bald 

eagle. And it is likely that they would be dismayed to learn the fate of 

the obscure Tecopa pupfish, which lost its sole habitat, a hot springs in 

Death Valley, to a bathhouse that could easily have been redesigned to 

save the fish. Instead, it became the first species to be removed from the 

endangered list by reason of extinction. But feelings are much less 

certain when it comes to canceling a $100 million golf course to save a 

bug nobody has ever heard of.<P>

Perhaps fifty silverspots live on the land for Schroeder's project. How 

can anyone imagine that they are worth keeping in place of a multimillion

dollar resort? On the other hand, how can anyone sanction the elimination 

of a species from this earth to profit a few people? Would the decision be 

different if the land housed five insects, rather than fifty? Or if it 

held not butterflies but bald eagles? What if chemicals within butterflies 

turn out to have medical benefits, whereas eagles are useful only as a 

national symbol? And what if saving the eagle required canceling not one 

but ten resorts?<P>

Until recent decades Americans were untroubled by such questions. The 

nation was still empty. It didn't seem possible that preserving a few 

animals could impose real hardship. There seemed no need to choose between 

a species and economic growth. But now the country's empty corners are 

filling up, and biologists warn that in the next decade or two the fate of 

thousands of species will be decided. In making those decisions, ordinary 

notions of balancing the benefits against the costs may seem 

inappropriate, inapplicable, or even immoral. Yet any time we decide that 

a course of action makes some entity "better off"--butterfly, golf-course 

builder, or society as a whole--we are perforce judging that whatever the 

benefits, they are greater than the costs. At present these decisions are 

governed by the Endangered Species Act. Unfortunately, the act fails to 

balance costs and benefits meaningfully. Indeed, it is put together in 

such a way that it explicitly avoids the terrible choices that must be 

faced.<P>

Federal wildlife-protection laws go back to the end of the past century, 

when a famous poacher named Ed Howell slaughtered bison in Yellowstone 

National Park with impunity because no statute forbade it; public outrage 

at Howell's cheeky remarks to the newspapers pushed Congress into passing 

the Yellowstone Park Protection Act of 1894. Other laws followed. Mostly 

aimed at poachers, they cost society little, and roused little opposition. 

In 1964 the Bureau of Sports Fisheries and Wildlife, the bureaucratic 

ancestor of today's Fish and Wildlife Service, compiled a "redbook" of 

sixty-three endangered species. Assembled informally by a panel of nine 

biologists, the redbook was the government's first endangered-species 

list. Laws passed in 1966 and 1969 directed the Department of the Interior 

to formalize the list and to protect the species on it by acquiring their 

habitats. These statutes were weak--they did not actually ban killing 

members of endangered species except in national wildlife refuges. When 

President Richard M. Nixon called for stringent legislation in 1972, the 

bid fell on receptive ears. Congress passed the Endangered Species Act by 

a large majority in December of 1973, and Nixon quickly signed it. Neither 

seems to have had a clue about what they were setting in motion.<P>

"They thought they were writing a law about saving bald eagles and elk-

what I call the 'charismatic megafauna,'" says Dennis Murphy, the director 

of the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford. "Instead, they got a 

law protecting species"--a difference with unexpected implications. 

According to Edward O. Wilson, a renowned entomologist at Harvard, there 

are only a few thousand types of the mammals and birds that people like to 

anthropomorphize, but there may be something on the order of 100 million 

species, of which only about 1.4 million have been named. Creatures such 

as fungi, insects, and bacteria form the vast majority of this horde; 

mammals, birds, and other vertebrates are little but colorful 

epiphenomena. (Asked what years of research had taught him about God, 

J.B.S. Haldane, one of the founders of evolutionary biology, replied that 

the Creator had an "inordinate fondness for beetles.") Those not initiated 

into the ways of biological thought may equate "preserving global 

biodiversity" with saving whales and whooping cranes, but scientists who 

use the phrase are concerned with protecting organisms that most people 

wouldn't hesitate to step on.<P>

Because the majority of species are unknown, no one can say with certainty 

how many are going extinct. Moreover, extinction itself is hard to 

observe--one can never be certain that a few specimens somewhere have not 

been overlooked. Thought for more than a decade to be extinct, the 

Shoshone pupfish, a cousin of the Tecopa pupfish, turned up in its native 

hot springs in 1986. The long-lost black-footed ferret was rediscovered 

accidentally a decade ago, when a ranch dog near Meeteetse, Wyoming, 

returned home with a dead one in its mouth; excited conservationists then 

found a small colony of the weasel-like creatures. But no one doubts that 

extinction occurs, and most biologists believe that it is now taking place 

at an accelerating rate. Worldwide, Wilson guesses, the rate may be 50,000 

species a year. Figures for the United States are surprisingly uncertain, 

but Peter Hoch, of the Missouri Botanical Garden, has calculated what he 

calls a "rough but defensible approximation": some 4,000 domestic species 

are at risk of extinction within five to ten years.<P>

Biologists advance three arguments for avoiding this prospect. On a 

utilitarian level, living creatures are the source of almost all foods and 

many medicines; wiping out even the humblest mold might deprive humanity 

of the genes for a future penicillin. Wilson has calculated that the 

genetic information encoded in the DNA from the common mouse, if 

represented as ordinary-size letters, would almost fill the fifteen 

editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica printed since 1768. Who, 

conservationists ask, would like to see that information vanish, along 

with its potential benefit to humanity?<P>

More generally, the web of species around us helps generate soil, regulate 

freshwater supplies, dispose of waste, and maintain the quality of the 

atmosphere. Pillaging nature to the point where it cannot perform these 

functions is dangerously foolish. Simple self-protection is thus a second 

motive for preserving biodiversity. When DDT was sprayed in Borneo, the 

biologists Paul and Anne Ehrlich relate in their book Extinction (1981), 

it killed all the houseflies. The gecko lizards that preyed on the flies 

ate their pesticide-filled corpses and died. House cats consumed the dying 

lizards; they died too. Rats descended on the villages, bringing bubonic 

plague. Incredibly, the housefly in this case was part of an intricate 

system that controlled human disease. To make up for its absence, the 

government was forced to parachute cats into the area.<P>

These reasons for protecting biodiversity are practical and 

anthropocentric. But the "foremost argument for the preservation of all 

nonhuman species," the Ehrlichs argue in Extinction, is neither. It is the 

"religious" belief "that our fellow passengers on Spaceship Earth . . . 

have a right to exist." Far from being extreme, the "Noah Principle," as this 

argument was named by the biologist David Ehrenfeld, is shared by many 

scientists and conservationists. As a species, the Noah Principle says, 

the smallest grub has the same right to exist as the biggest whale; so 

does every species of cockroach, every species of stinging nettle (all 

plants are included in these arguments), and even the microorganisms that 

cause malaria and syphilis. Anthropologists refuse to categorize cultures 

as "higher" and "lower" civilizations, because all have intrinsic worth; 

biologists believe that there is no inherent difference in value between 

"higher" and "lower" organisms. All are precious, and human beings have a 

moral responsibility to each and every one. "It's a matter of 

stewardship," Wilson says.<P>

The practical and moral costs of losing the nation's biological endowment 

may be enormous. But so may be the cost of saving it. To halt the spasm of 

extinction, Wilson and Paul Ehrlich wrote in a special biodiversity issue 

of Science last August,<P>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

the first step . . . would be to cease 'developing' any more relatively 

undisturbed land. Every new shopping center built in the California 

chaparral, every hectare of tropical forest cut and burned, every swamp 

converted into a rice paddy or shrimp farm means less 

biodiversity. . . . [Even so,] ending direct human incursions into remaining 

relatively undisturbed habitats would be only a start. . . . The indispensable 

strategy for saving our fellow living creatures and ourselves in the long 

run is . . . to reduce the scale of human activities.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





"To reduce the scale of human activities" implies telling people to make 

do with less; nations must choose between their natural heritage and the 

economic well-being of their citizens.<P>

<BR>



<font size=5>T</font>HE endangered species act is this country's response to that choice. It 

strongly favors preserving biodiversity--more strongly, conservationists 

say, than any other environmental law in the world. "Quite frankly," 

Murphy says, "it is the best weapon we have." It didn't start out that 

way. Indeed, few grasped the act's implications until its first test 

before the Supreme Court. On one side was the Tellico Dam, a Tennessee 

Valley Authority project frequently described as a boondoggle. On the 

other was the snail darter, a three-inch snail-eating fish that was first 

observed in 1973, six years after Tellico began construction and shortly 

before the act became law. Handed this unexpected weapon, Tellico's 

opponents petitioned the Fish and Wildlife Service to list the fish on an 

emergency basis in 1975. The amazed TVA complained that Tellico's 

environmental-impact statement had passed two federal court reviews, that 

$50 million in taxpayers' money had already been spent, that the dam would 

provide flood control, hydroelectric power, and recreational facilities (a 

lake). It claimed that the snail darter was found elsewhere, and thus was 

not endangered. Nonetheless the service listed the darter, and a civil 

action ensued, based on the Endangered Species Act. By 1978 the suit had 

wound its way up the legal trellis to the Supreme Court.<P>

Attorney General Griffin Bell personally argued the case, attempting to 

demonstrate the snail darter's insignificance by displaying one to the 

justices. The tactic failed. In June of 1978 the Court ruled that "the 

plain intent of Congress" was to stop extinction no matter what the cost. 

The language of the act, the Court said, "shows clearly that Congress 

viewed the value of endangered species as 'incalculable'"--in practical 

terms, infinite. Obviously, a $100 million dam was worth less than an 

infinitely valuable fish. Simple logic dictated halting Tellico. <P>

The decision had a "bombshell impact on Capitol Hill," says Donald Barry, 

of the World Wildlife Fund, who was then a staff attorney in the 

solicitor's office of the Department of the Interior. Even some of the 

law's most ardent congressional supporters were alarmed by its 

inflexibility, although that inflexibility, of course, endeared the act to 

environmentalists. Tellico's principal sponsor, Senate minority leader 

Howard H. Baker, Jr., of Tennessee, set out to change the act. The ensuing 

political maneuvering led to the establishment of a small escape hatch: a 

committee that could be convened when all other attempts had failed to 

resolve conflicts between protecting a species and building a project 

requiring federal funds or permits. Because it included several Cabinet 

members, the committee could not be summoned every time an endangered 

species was threatened. On the other hand, it could authorize the 

extinction of a species, as long as the benefits of the project strongly 

outweighed the benefits of actions aimed at saving the species. In its 

first meeting the "God Committee," as it was soon nicknamed, unanimously 

found in favor of the snail darter, though mostly because the group 

regarded Tellico as a waste of money.<P>

Baker rammed through legislation exempting Tellico from the Endangered 

Species Act. The dam was built and, as predicted, proved to be less than 

an economic dynamo; a few years later more snail darters turned up in 

other rivers nearby. (The fish was downgraded to "threatened" in 1984.) 

But the whole affair set a pattern that has continued to the present. 

People who care little about the endangered species frequently invoke them 

as an excuse to stop projects; the science used to justify the actions of 

one side or another is often rushed, as it was for Tellico, and can be so 

incomplete that it verges on the fraudulent; and, most important, the law 

still insists that species must be saved no matter what the cost.<P>

For the Fish and Wildlife Service, this set of circumstances has turned 

the Endangered Species Act into a bureaucratic horror. The agency, 

formerly a haven for guys who liked to work outdoors, is now a hot spot of 

sophisticated partisan arm-twisting. Hundreds of petitions flow in every 

year, and the service must evaluate them all, with litigious interest 

groups scrutinizing every move. Consequently, listing moves at a crawl. As 

of November, the most recent date for which official figures are 

available, 668 domestic species, more than half of which are plants and 

invertebrates, clung to their places on the list. Another 100 had been 

accepted for the list, but the service had not yet published a final 

notice about them in the Federal Register, the last step in listing. Some 

500 species resided in a curious state of limbo called Category I: the 

Fish and Wildlife Service agreed that they merited listing but had not got 

around to accepting them officially. A further 3,000 occupied a second 

limbo, Category II: the service thought they might merit listing but had 

not yet investigated fully. At the current rate of progress, according to 

a 1990 report by the Department of the Interior's own Office of Inspector 

General, clearing today's backlog may take up to forty-eight years, during 

which time many more species will be menaced. Already, several species 

have vanished while the government was trying to decide whether they were 

endangered.<P>

After listing a species, the Fish and Wildlife Service puts together a 

"recovery plan" for it. And here too, the agency is behind, though the 

reasons are as much budgetary as political. It has approved 364 recovery 

plans, covering about half the listed species, but few have been 

implemented. In its 1990 report the Office of Inspector General estimated 

the recovery cost for all species currently listed or expected to be at 

$4.6 billion, spread over ten years. The service's 1990 budget for 

recovering species was $10.6 million. Other agencies pitch in, but even 

so, in 1990 the total state and federal budget for all aspects of 

endangered species--listing, research, land acquisition, and so on--was just $102 million, 

less than a fourth of the annual amount needed for recovery alone.<P>

In reading these figures, one conclusion is inescapable: more species-

many more--will be driven, like the Tecopa pupfish, to extinction. Few 

species are unsavable today; concerted human effort can save most of them. 

But we are unlikely to have the means to save them all. In this 

deficit-ridden age Fish and Wildlife Service budgets will not climb to the 

altitude necessary to save the few hundred species on the list, let alone 

the thousands upon thousands of unlisted species that biologists regard as 

endangered. Like cost-conscious Noahs, Americans will pick which creatures 

to bring with them and which to leave behind. The choice is 

inescapable--but the Endangered Species Act, in its insistence that we 

save every species, implicitly rejects this responsibility. As a result, 

the government is left with little guidance. It moves almost at random, 

with dismaying consequences.<P>

<B>THE FALL OF A SPARROW</B><P>



<font size=5>T</font>HE heart of the last dusky seaside sparrow sits in a freezer in the 

genetics department of the University of Georgia. Orange Band (the bird 

was named for the colored identity band on its leg) had lived in captivity 

for seven years, much of the time in a cage at Walt Disney World. It died 

on June 16, 1987, twenty years after the Fish and Wildlife Service 

included the dusky seaside sparrow on its first official endangered

species list. Orange Band's death, environmentalists said, was a signal 

failure of the Endangered Species Act. But it might be more accurate to 

say that the bird was a casualty of trying to follow the Noah Principle on 

a limited budget.<P>

Knowing that it did not have the resources to save every species, the 

agency sought impartial scientific criteria that would enable it to focus 

its efforts on some species rather than others; politics and guesswork 

would be eliminated. From the beginning this goal proved elusive, and the 

sparrow's disappearance came at the end of a roller-coaster ride through 

the rankings.<P>

Ammodramus maritima nigrescens, as scientists now refer to the dusky, was 

discovered in 1872. One of nine subspecies of the seaside sparrow 

(ornithologists dispute the exact number), the dusky was native to the 

complex waterlogged terrain of east central Florida. Scattered through 

this coastal area are brackish marshes that breed mosquitoes at a 

staggering rate--more than a million can spring from a square yard of 

mucky turf in a day. The marshes also bred dusky seaside sparrows. Less 

than six inches in size, their bellies streaked in black and white, 

duskies were finicky creatures; they nested only in patches of marsh grass 

that had no shrubs or trees in sight. Because this kind of open space is 

hard to come by, A.m. nigrescens had the smallest range of any North 

American bird: two bits of Brevard County, Florida. One was a few miles 

inland, near the St. Johns River; the other was offshore, on marshy 

Merritt Island.<P>

This part of Florida first acquired renown in the late 1950s, when NASA 

bought Merritt Island and turned it into what is now called the John F. 

Kennedy Space Center. (Cape Canaveral is a point on the east side of the 

island.) Many daunting obstacles faced the country on its path to space, 

but one of the worst was the mosquito. "I was grilling hamburgers 

outdoors, and hordes of mosquitoes were landing on them to get the blood," 

recalls Herbert Kale, the vice-president for ornithology of the Florida 

Audubon Society, describing a visit to a piece of Florida wetland with no 

mosquito control. "You'd flip the meat and dozens of mosquitoes would burn 

up as they clung to it." Pesticides had become available in the 1940s, and 

Brevard County drenched itself with them until the mosquitoes became 

resistant. Switching tactics in 1955, the county sliced the marsh into 

large squares, built low walls around the edges, and waited for the pools 

to be filled up by rain, storm tides, and pumping. Because salt-marsh 

mosquitoes can't lay their eggs in standing fresh water, NASA employees 

were soon able to drive to work with the windows open. Bird watchers were 

thrilled too. The paddy-like pools attracted huge numbers of herons, 

egrets, and ducks. Allan Cruickshank, a well-known ornithologist who lived 

nearby, urged NASA to turn the northern part of its land, bought as a 

buffer zone, into a wildlife refuge. The space agency was happy to oblige

-it was never going to build on the land--and Merritt Island National 

Wildlife Refuge was born.<P>

The refuge didn't help the dusky. DDT and other pesticides had shrunk the 

Merritt Island population, never large, by perhaps 70 percent; impounding 

the marsh reduced it further, because it killed the grass habitat that 

duskies required. By 1968, when, at Cruickshank's suggestion, a graduate 

student from the University of Wisconsin surveyed the refuge, no more than 

thirty-five males lived on the few hundred remaining acres of dusky 

habitat. (Females were much harder to spot, and researchers didn't try to 

count them.) Five years later only two males were left on Merritt 

Island.<P>

On the mainland the second population was in trouble too. Ranchers drained 

the marshes with ditches, turning them into pasture. To provide green 

forage, they burned off the dead marsh grass. Several hundred duskies had 

managed to hang on, but the situation was desperate. A.m. nigrescens had 

support from bird watchers and scientists like Cruickshank and Kale. They 

lobbied the Jacksonville branch of the Fish and Wildlife Service, which in 

l969 begged headquarters to buy out the ranchers, a measure that it said 

"could mean the difference between survival and extinction of a 

species."<P>

The agency now had to decide what it was going to do about the dusky. Was 

it going to lead the bird onto the ark, or strand it ashore? The choice 

was not easy. In 1969 Congress had appropriated $1.3 million for acquiring 

endangered-species habitat. Several thousand acres of Florida swamp would 

cost more than a million dollars. Spending that money on A.m. nigrescens 

would mean not spending it on other, equally desperate species. Should the 

Office of Endangered Species save the dusky and lose, say, the American 

alligator or the key deer? What Solomon could tell the agency which course 

to follow?<P>

Absent biblical authority, C. Eugene Ruhr, the office's supervisor for 

domestic species, had to figure out the answer himself. He thought the 

decision could best be made by coming up with a coherent set of 

priorities. In 1971 he set down a method for ranking species, by giving 

them a numerical score in each of ten biological and economic categories. 

At the end Ruhr added the ten scores together; the higher the sum, the 

higher the priority awarded to that species.<P>

Critics attacked the procedure as ridiculous. Because scores were 

subjective, the same species might be ranked differently by different 

people. Moreover, the plan suffered from what Lynn Llewellyn, a service 

officer, later called the "apples + oranges - grapes = fruit salad" 

problem. A species might receive a 50 in the population-change category 

and another 50 in the recovery-cost category. But nobody knew if one 50 

should count as much as the other, and so the system was never fully 

applied.<P>

Determined to produce a rational basis for making choices, Ruhr asked two 

migratory-bird specialists, Howard M. Wight and the aptly named Rollin 

Sparrowe, to come up with a less subjective one. In 1973 the two men 

created a plan that separated biological factors from non-biological 

factors, such as public interest in a species, creating two priority 

systems. In a test of the biological priority system, the highest score 

awarded--78.25 out of 100--went to the (California condor. With a score of 

61.75 the dusky was tied with the American peregrine falcon and the 

Mississippi sandhill crane. Its score would have been higher if the 

American Ornithologists' Union had not that year officially downgraded the 

bird from a full species to a mere subspecies. As a subspecies, the dusky 

ranked forty-second among the 180 species surveyed; as a species, it would 

almost certainly have ranked in the top twenty, and maybe Wight and 

Sparrowe would have placed it in the top ten.<P>

Keith Schreiner, then the head of the Office of Endangered Species, was 

still dissatisfied. The Wight-Sparrowe system gave highest priority to 

species on the brink of oblivion, like the condor. These "basket cases" 

(Schreiner's term) were always expensive to resuscitate, which implied 

that the government would be spending all its money on species with little 

chance for success. Moreover, the system didn't take into account whether 

species were favored by powerful members of Congress. ("You had to 

allocate your resources in a way to avoid shutting off future monetary 

resources," Schreiner says, matter-of-factly.) In 1976 Schreiner asked 

another service biologist, David Marshall, to construct a third ranking 

system, this one directly taking into account that Capitol Hill was more 

likely to support what Marshall calls "glamour species" than "creepy

crawlies." Reluctant to endorse a policy that courted Congress at the 

expense of biological principles, Marshall nonetheless produced a scheme 

that added in political factors. His plan combined a biological score 

similar to that of Wight and Sparrowe with an ecopolitical score 

determined by the amount of "support" for a species inside and outside the 

scientific community. (Wight and Sparrowe kept the two scores separate, 

de-emphasizing the political.) In short, a species got a boost for doing 

well in a popularity contest.<P>

This badly hurt the dusky. When the bird was downgraded to a subspecies, 

it lost an important ecopolitical constituency--bird watchers, who collect 

observations of species, rather than subspecies. The dusky plummeted to 

ninety-seventh place in the general rankings, far below the falcon, which 

rose to eighth place, and somewhat below the crane, which dropped to 

seventy-seventh.<P>

The Fish and Wildlife Service paid little attention to the ups and downs 

of the bird's ranking. Even before Ruhr had written up his ranking system, 

it had decided to put much of its land-acquisition budget into buying 

dusky habitat. (We could find no one able to explain this decision.) By 

1972 the agency had set up a second wildlife reserve in Brevard County, 

the St. Johns National Wildlife Refuge, on more than 2,000 acres of former 

ranchland. The price was $787,000--almost a third of the agency's total 

land-acquisition expenditures for endangered species in that year. Over 

the next four years it spent almost a million dollars to add another 2,000 

acres.<P>

What happened next has been eloquently described by Mark Jerome Walters, a 

journalist whose book on the dusky's extinction, A Shadow and a Song, will 

be published this fall by Chelsea Green. Despite the high cost of 

acquiring dusky habitat, the service failed to take care of it. 

Specifically, it didn't plug a major drainage--a task that Walters says 

would have taken "a couple guys with shovels a couple of days." As a 

result, the land dried out further. Nearby ranchers continued to burn 

fields. In December of 1975 a pasture fire went out of control and burned 

three quarters of the refuge. Only eleven males survived.<P>

The recovery team, of which Herbert Kale, the Brevard County 

ornithologist, was a member, had already urged the service to buy a second 

piece of habitat to the south, near a proposed extension of the Beeline 

Expressway (so called because it cuts straight across central Florida). 

The agency agreed; it bought 1,500 more acres for the dusky. But again, it 

did not fill in the ditches--it was still negotiating to buy a big ranch 

in the middle of the reserve, and could not legally cut off its drainage. 

By mid-1978 Washington had bought some 6,200 acres at a cost of $2.6 

million.<P>

That summer the agency surveyed the dusky population. It found twenty

four males: four on the burned northern part of the refuge, twenty on the 

new southern part, and none on Merritt Island. On August 31 staffers in 

the Atlanta office met to discuss the bird's future. Costs, they believed, 

had to be balanced against benefits. In view of the small number of surviving birds, they asked Washington for 

permission to "hold the line on future land acquisition." The remaining 

dusky money, as much as a million dollars, could go to another endangered 

species, the American crocodile. Schreiner concurred. "We always went for 

the ones with the best chance of recovery with the least money," he told 

us recently. "It would have been senseless to commit a large sum of money 

to that species when other species could have used the money and actually 

survived." The service stopped negotiating to buy the last ranch, an act 

that effectively doomed the last wild population of A.m. nigrescens. 

Amazingly, the agency had a fourth priority system at the time--and in 

this one the dusky was placed in the fifth highest of forty possible 

recovery categories. (The St. Johns refuge still exists, its northern half 

a favorite landing spot for migratory birds, its southern half a testament 

to the effects of what Kale calls "benign neglect.")<P>

Kale and Will Post, then a biologist at the Florida Game and Fresh Water 

Fish Commission, suggested breeding the sparrow in captivity. No female 

duskies had been seen since 1976, but the bird still had a chance. If 

dusky males were bred to females of a related subspecies, the Scott's 

seaside sparrow (A.m. peninsulae), the chicks would be half dusky. Female 

hybrids could then be "back-crossed" to the dusky males, producing birds 

that were three-quarters dusky. The sixth generation would be 98.4 percent 

pure.<P>

After requesting a legal opinion about the propriety of the program, the 

Fish and Wildlife Service allowed Kale to capture the last five wild birds 

in 1979 and 1980. The first generation of hybrids was healthy and fertile. 

Pleased, Kale asked for permission to continue--only to discover that the 

service had changed its mind. A new legal opinion said that the Endangered 

Species Act covered pure species only, and that federal money therefore 

could not be spent on hybrids. Despite an offer to fund the project 

privately, the service declared A.m. nigrescens off limits.<P>

The stubborn Kale made his pitch again in 1983, this time working with 

curators at Walt Disney World's Discovery Island. With Mickey Mouse 

picking up the tab, taxpayers' funds would not be involved. In the 

meantime, Kale says, the service had been working on a similar back

crossing project for a more popular, "macho" bird, the peregrine falcon. 

Yet another legal opinion was issued by the agency's solicitor, and both 

the falcon and sparrow projects were allowed to proceed.<P>

Nothing went right. One of the dusky males died of old age. Some of the 

female hybrids turned out, on closer inspection, to be males. The Scott's 

sparrows tended to die of unknown causes. One hybrid female was mated to 

three dusky males, ultimately building six nests and laying eleven eggs. 

Only one hatched. Many of the other pairs were incompatible. The males, 

Kale realized, were too old. He was bitter about the two-year delay caused 

by the service's confusion over its hybrid policy. In a half-hearted 

fashion the breeding project continued at Disney World. Care of the hybrid 

birds was imprecise. They were killed by storms; they were killed by rats; 

some simply disappeared. The pure birds died, one by one, until only 

Orange Band was left.<P>

Extinction was not the final blow. After Orange Band died, researchers at 

the University of Georgia analyzed part of the bird's genetic makeup. As 

best they could determine, Orange Band's DNA was almost identical to the 

DNA from other seaside sparrow subspecies. ("The last A.m. nigrescens," 

they wrote, "appears to have been a routine example of the Atlantic coast 

phylad of seaside sparrow"--a conclusion that Kale hotly disputes.) If the 

bird was not even a separate subspecies, the service's extraordinary 

conservation effort had been misapplied.<P>

Meanwhile, the service has continued to fumble over the question of which 

species to help into the ark. Its current priority system--the sixth, by 

our count--was adopted in 1983. Three factors are considered: the degree 

of threat faced by a species, its potential for successful recovery, and 

its taxonomic status (whether it has close genetic relatives). Recovery 

priorities rank from a high of 1 to a low of 18; species that are in 

conflict with land development are supposed to receive speedier treatment. 

Explicitly left out of consideration is the type of species involved; 

despite the widespread perception that Congress prefers "glamour species," 

it has officially instructed the Fish and Wildlife Service to award equal 

protection to "higher" and "lower" forms of life. The Oregon silverspot 

butterfly and Fassett's locoweed are thus supposed to be on equal terms 

with the bald eagle and the northern spotted owl, because they all have 

the same priority rank.<P>

The ranking system does not set rules for deciding how much to spend on 

which species. Nonetheless, some correlation should exist between a 

species's recovery priority and what is spent on it. Unfortunately, none 

does, raising the specter of more duskies to come. A.m. nigrescens itself 

rated a 6 in the 1983 system, sharing that rank with thirty-eight other 

species, including the northeastern beach tiger beetle and the Florida 

panther. In 1990 the service spent not one penny to bolster the beetle's 

chances for survival; other federal agencies spent $500. Meanwhile, the 

Florida panther, a "higher" life form, received $3.8 million. The 

aberrations are by no means restricted to priority 6. Average expenditures 

for the eight species with a recovery priority of 1 were $100,000 LESS 

than those for species with a priority of 6. The government lavished an 

average of $53,200 on priority-15 species, but starved priority-4 species 

with an average per-species budget of $5,500. More than half of the $100 

million that state and federal governments devoted to endangered species 

was awarded to eleven species--less than two percent of those on the list. 

A hundred and fourteen species received no money at all.<P>

On average, the service spent more on subspecies than on full species, 

more on species with a low recovery potential than on those with a high 

recovery potential, and, despite congressional instructions to the 

contrary, fourteen times as much on "charismatic megafauna" as on other 

types of species. Perhaps most troubling, average federal and state 

disbursements are actually lower for endangered species than for 

threatened species. Two of the three most expensive species--the northern 

spotted owl ($9.7 million, the highest single expenditure) and the grizzly 

bear ($5.9 million)--are threatened, not endangered. (The third species, a 

bird called the least Bell's vireo, is endangered; it received $9.2 

million.)<P>

Kale was still angry at the Fish and Wildlife Service when we spoke to him 

last fall. (He seemed as irate as Richard Schroeder.) The service, Kale 

said, had paid lots of money for habitat that it had not managed; it had 

then spent still more, only to decide that a final, key parcel of land was 

not worth the trouble. Even when somebody else was willing to pay, it had 

refused for several years to allow a last-ditch captive-breeding effort. 

The whole business, he thought, was senseless and sad. The service had 

made decisions, but in the most haphazard way, and everyone was the worse 

for it. He could remember going into the marshes in the 1950s and seeing 

duskies lined up singing in the grass by the road.<P>

<B>THE AMERICAN WAY</B><P>



<font size=5>N</font>EAR the town of Mima, in Southwestern Washington State, an acre of rich 

dark soil is stitched with neat rows of small plants. From a distance the 

field seems to be growing a thriving crop of carrots. But these plants 

will not find their way onto a dinner plate. The field and nine more acres 

nearby contain a million seedlings of a tree, the Pacific yew (Taxus 

brevifolia).<P>

Ten acres of seedlings is not a large tract by the standards of its owner, 

the Weyerhaeuser Company, of Federal Way, Washington, which plants almost 

280 million seedlings a year. Nonetheless, this tree farm has attracted 

extraordinary attention. The bark, needles, and roots of T. brevifolia 

contain taxol, a potential treatment for ovarian cancer. Resistant to 

chemotherapy, cancer of the ovary is one of the most intractable forms of 

the disease; it has an overall five-year survival rate of less than 40 

percent. This single crop of yew seedlings could yield enough taxol to 

treat a large proportion of the 20,000 women who are stricken each year 

with ovarian cancer.<P>

The discovery of taxol is exactly what Congress had in mind when it passed 

the Endangered Species Act. "Who knows, or can say," asked one 

congressional report on the act, "what potential cures for cancer or other 

scourges, present or future, may lie locked up in the structures of plants 

which may yet be undiscovered, much less analyzed?" But the yew is also an 

implicit rebuke to the means Congress chose to safeguard those potential 

cures. A few years ago T. brevifolia was treated as a weed, burned on the 

ground as slash whenever bigger and more valuable trees were cut down. It 

was not officially endangered or threatened, but its numbers were 

decreasing. Now the species is flourishing as never before, but the 

recovery occurred by means so far from the Fish and Wildlife Service that 

one cannot help wondering if orthodox governmental plans to save 

biodiversity are asking the right questions, let alone providing the right 

answers.<P>

The yew's journey to salvation started in the late 1950s, when the 

National Cancer Institute began randomly testing the cancer-fighting 

potential of thousands--nobody knows the full number--of plants, bacteria, 

fungi, and molds. The procedure now followed by the NCI Developmental 

Therapeutics Program is complex in detail but simple in principle: 

Researchers grind up a small sample of an organism and administer it to 

cancer cells. If the cells react, the sample is separated into its 

chemical constituents, which are tested separately in a procedure 

analogous to sifting through a set of ever-finer sieves. According to 

Michael Grover, the associate director of the program, approximately one 

quarter of today's cancer drugs were discovered through such random 

screening, either by the NCI or by private drug firms. Taxol, the latest 

example, emerged from the NCI's program in 1971.<P>

Testing the compound was no easy task. One mature tree's worth of bark-

about forty pounds--yields one twentieth of an ounce of taxol, not enough 

to treat one patient. A big research push would require tons of bark. The 

first, small-scale clinical trials, in 1983, produced such severe allergic 

reactions that many had to be abandoned. Researchers resumed them after 

discovering that patients had probably reacted to the medium in which the 

taxol was administered--a form of castor oil--rather than to the drug 

itself. Subsequent results showed that taxol might have power over breast 

and lung cancer as well as ovarian cancer. The trials were small because 

taxol was so scarce. Nonetheless, NCI officials told reporters last June 

that the drug "may be one of the most important anticancer agents 

discovered in the past decade."<P>



The prospect created almost as much fear as elation.  The yew and its 

cousins have been revered since the Stone Age, when spears were hewn from 

their tough yet flexible wood.  The finest English longbows were made from 

yew.  Growing often in cemeteries, they developed gnarled roots that were 

supposed to wrap the dead.  In contrast, the modern timber industry has had 

little use for the tree, because it grows too slowly; unable to produce big 

logs, the yew was cut down and not replanted.  Only in old-growth forests 

have yews survived long enough to grow tall (for a yew, forty feet is tall) 

and accumulate a lot of bark.  When the NCI issued a call for large-scale 

taxol research, in June of 1990, conservationists feared that continued 

clear-cutting would wipe out the yew--along with the taxol it contains--and 

the mighty forests it lives in.  The Environmental Defense Fund called for 

changes in the way timber is sold; Jerry Rust, an Oregon county 

commissioner, formed a Native Yew Conservation Council; the Oregon Natural 

Resources Council threatened legal action to force the government to 

prospect for yew logs in old clear cuts rather than relying on new ones.  

"The waste is appalling," says Wendell Wood, the conservation coordinator 

of the Oregon Natural Resources Council.  "They're still burning countless 

yews on the slash pile.  It's like Ollie North on the shredder.  They're 

burning the evidence and denying the problem ever existed."<P>



To satisfy the demand for taxol, yew logs are now being plucked out of old 

clear-cuts by single mothers, laid-off loggers, and surly countercultural 

leftovers who live in the woods and make their livelihood by picking brush 

for flower arrangers, herb specialists, and plant stores. Piled high with 

gunny sacks of yew bark, their battered pickup trucks line up outside the 

taxol-extraction plant in Cottage Grove, Oregon. The procedure seems 

innocent enough, but the conversation in the line on the day we visited 

would have alarmed Wendell Wood. The trucks had anti-corporate and anti

military bumper stickers. Despite these sentiments, the drivers joked 

about how they could drive into national forests and rustle some yews. 

"The bark's real loose," one man explained to us. "You can stick in a 

screwdriver and peel them like sausages." Another had his rig loaded 

dangerously high. "I got to get it now," he said. "Pretty soon there won't 

be any left."<P>

These words exemplify the notion that extinction is an inevitable by

product of what is called "the tragedy of the commons." Coined by the 

biologist Garrett Hardin in 1968, the phrase refers to the instructive 

tale of the communal pasture in medieval villages. All nearby herdsman 

were allowed, the story goes, to graze their cattle on this land. As 

individuals, the herdsman benefited by grazing as many cattle as possible; 

but the community as a whole was better off when herdsman restricted 

grazing enough to keep the grass alive. Because what one person conserved 

another could use, nobody had an incentive to conserve anything, and the 

commons was doomed. In general, Hardin argued, there is little incentive 

to maintain common property, for the costs may be borne by one while the 

benefits are enjoyed by all.<P>

Similar reasoning applies to wildlife, which is owned, so to speak, by 

everyone. Society as a whole may benefit from its continued existence but 

few people are prepared to pay for it by themselves. Passenger pigeons, a 

favorite game bird in the nineteenth century, were driven to extinction 

because hunters had no incentive to stop taking them when their fellows 

could keep blasting away. Conservationists believe that the yew, being a 

common resource, is a future passenger pigeon. Before the benefits of 

taxol were discovered, humanity was indifferent to the tree's fate and its 

numbers declined slowly; now the yew is valuable, and its future, 

according to this reasoning, is bleaker still.<P>

The customary response to this prospect is a law to protect common 

property. Few people oppose such legislation when it involves, say, anti

poaching laws to protect bison in Yellowstone Park. Opinions change when 

the Endangered Species Act compels the Richard Schroeders of America to 

abandon their golf courses. These people are not profiting from rare 

animals; they simply want to build something on their property. In some 

cases the government pays for the land, as the Fish and Wildlife Service 

did for the St. Johns National Wildlife Refuge. More often the law simply 

limits what landowners can build or change, forcing them to bear the cost 

of saving the species while others reap the benefits. People who would 

ordinarily be neutral toward rare animals are thus converted into outright 

antagonists. "If they had just let the cows run loose and eat the 

[caterpillars' food plants] down, they would never have had a butterfly 

problem," says Dewey Youngblood, one of Schroeder's financial backers. 

"The problem was, we tried to work with the butterfly. But it became 

apparent after two years that there was no end in sight to the problem." 

Not everyone is so nice. In a case that may be a harbinger of the future, 

one developer is widely reported to have sped a project along by 

destroying one of the three known populations of the endangered San Diego 

mesa mint.<P>

This hostility, economists say, shows that the Endangered Species Act 

works against people's incentives, not with them. Instead, the argument 

runs, we should compensate those who bear the brunt of saving a species. 

Gardner Brown, Jr., an economist at the University of Washington, points 

to the plight of the small landholders who live around Kenya's elephant 

parks. The parks are too small, and the roaming elephants eat up the crops 

outside their borders. Because the farmers cannot shoot the beasts, they 

must silently pay the price for their existence. "Why not give them 

something in return?" Brown asks. "Why should they suffer so that people 

in the developed world can feel good? What if we banned the importation of 

film by tourists, and awarded the farmers the exclusive Kodak franchise? 

Let them sell film at twenty dollars a roll! The tourists, who are the 

main beneficiaries of the elephants in any case, would be shelling out to 

save them. The farmers, who are being ruined by them, would have a leg 

up." This example, Brown cautions, is merely illustrative, but it typifies 

economists' approach to conserving biodiversity. If the benefits of saving 

a species are tangible and measurable, they point out, why not turn over 

the task to a private party who is willing to bear the cost in exchange 

for a share of those benefits?<P>

In the best cases the method is simple: convert the commons into private 

property that can be marketed. Weyerhaeuser's five acres of yew seedlings 

embody this transformation. The nursery is the result of an agreement 

between the tree company and a drug company, Bristol-Myers Squibb. 

Bristol-Myers researchers were interested in taxol as soon as they learned 

of its novel properties, but they were dismayed by the obstacles involved 

in producing it. When the hopeful results from the first clinical trials 

appeared, the firm began thinking that production might be worth the 

effort. Last January the National Cancer Institute signed an agreement 

with Bristol-Myers to cooperate in the development of the drug. Bristol

Myers had been investigating three major methods of increasing the taxol 

supply: synthesizing the drug, growing yew cells in the laboratory, and 

tree farming. For their part, Weyerhaeuser researchers had begun in 1987 

to explore the chemistry, genetics, and husbandry of yews. After Bristol

Myers Squibb concluded its agreement with the NCI, Weyerhaeuser quietly 

negotiated with the drug maker. Last August the two companies announced a 

joint project to learn more about yew trees. If research and regulatory 

hurdles can be overcome, the domesticated yew could become a renewable 

source for a cancer medicine. In that case, says Steve Hee, Weyerhaeuser's 

nursery manager, "growing yews will become something that a lot of 

different people get involved in--it's the American way."<P>

In the next few years Weyerhaeuser will plant ten million yews, preserve 

yew seeds from the wild to ensure the tree's continued genetic diversity, 

open its land to yew-bark collectors in areas where the company is about 

to harvest its prime crop, Douglas fir, and search for ways to increase 

the taxol yield in the tree. Other forest-product companies will doubtless 

follow. No government agency ordered them to save the yew. Acting out of 

greed, that disquieting emotion, the same companies that burned yews 

indiscriminately only a few years ago will now spend hundreds of thousands 

of dollars to grow and protect millions of T. brevifolia. The yew will 

join the rose, the orange, and the cow--species that flourish because of 

the marketplace.<P>

Economists concede that not all stories can have such a happy ending. Yews 

stay in one place, making them easy to own. When a species has a large 

range, however, establishing property rights isn't practical. No one 

person could own monarch butterflies in the wild, because they migrate 

from Mexico to Canada. Moreover, the number of species with medical 

potential is small compared with the range of the world's living things. 

Most of the useful ones, NCI microbiologists say, are likely to be 

protozoa, algae, soil fungi, and the like--millions of unlovable organisms 

that contain a staggering array of genetic diversity. Finally, as David 

Ehrenfeld, the author of the Noah Principle, has written, "economic 

criteria of value are shifting, fluid, and utterly opportunistic in their 

practical application." Again, the yew may be an example. Weyerhaeuser's 

investment in the tree is a gamble: the company is betting that nobody 

will find a cheap way to synthesize taxol. But in 1988 researchers were 

already calling the drug "the number one target today of synthetic organic 

chemists," and interest has only increased since then. From a patient's 

point of view, cheaper taxol is better taxol. If that taxol comes from a 

vat, Weyerhaeuser and other timber firms will drop the yew like a weed. 

The species will be on its own again.<P>

"What exasperates me is the reluctance to try [the market] approach even 

when it is practical," says John Goldstein, an economist at the Department 

of the Interior. "Sure, markets won't save everything. But why won't 

people set them up when they can be useful?" One reason is that preserving 

the yew in a nursery is not the same as preserving it in the deep 

green-black shade of the forests that are the tree's natural setting. To 

conservationists, species are not sustained if they live only in zoos, on 

farms, or in seed banks. Biologists have scientific reasons for worrying 

about zoo populations--these tend to be small enough to risk losing 

genetic variability--but their larger distress is aesthetic and moral. 

Trained to view all living things as worthy, they are reluctant to assign 

high value to one species, because it implies assigning lower value to 

other species. "By assigning value to diversity," Ehrenfeld has argued, 

"we merely legitimize the process that is wiping it out." Markets, in this 

view, ineluctably sin against the Noah Principle. Our fellow passengers on 

Spaceship Earth should not be for sale.<P>

To economists, this attitude is baffling. "We can't save every species out 

there," Gardner Brown says. "But we can save a lot of them if we want to, 

and save them in ways that make sense economically and scientifically. To 

do that, we have to make some choices about which species we're going to 

preserve. And nobody wants to do that! Nobody!"<P>

Is that because they are dismayed by the prospect of playing God?<P>

"Oh, sure. But in this case God is just sitting on His hands, which is a 

pretty dangerous thing for Him to do."<P>

<B>THE BUTTERFLY SOLUTION</B><P>



<font size=5>R</font>ICHARD Schroeder is not the only person in Clatsop County, Oregon, with a 

butterfly problem. A few miles up the coast Northwest Conference Resorts, 

of San Carlos, California, is trying to build another golf course and 

housing complex in another patch of silverspot butterflies. Northwest 

Conference is run by Frank Hildreth and Donald Wudtke, two developers who 

would like people to know that they are not the sort of rapacious 

individuals one sees in the movies. "We're not fighting the system," 

Wudtke says. "We really believe in it." After the two men began thinking 

about the Oregon coast, Wudtke attended meetings of the butterfly recovery 

team, the group of scientists and bureaucrats set up by the Fish and 

Wildlife Service to guide the agency's efforts to restore the silverspot. 

Twenty-five professionals for a butterfly! He thought it astonishing. The 

scientists, Wudtke decided, were frustrated. "After eight years they 

hadn't established anything," he says. "They just talked and talked." In 

March of 1990  Northwest Conference signed a contract to buy 276 acres of 

grassy sand dunes. Like Schroeder, they had a butterfly problem. Hildreth 

and Wudtke were confident, however, that they had a solution: building a 

golf course and housing right around S.z. hippolyta.<P>

Their notion is more promising than it might seem at first glance. 

Silverspots, like many butterflies, are choosy about where they place 

their eggs. Because their caterpillars eat only the common blue violet, an 

inconspicuous wildflower that is customarily referred to by its scientific 

name, Viola adunca, they lay eggs exclusively near it. Because V. adunca 

grows only on open coastal grassland, that is as where S.z. hippolyta 

lives. As it happens, the silverspot tied its fortunes to the wrong 

flower, because such grassland is, in ecologists' terms, at a low 

"successional state," which means that it is inevitably overrun by 

brush--especially Scotch broom, a tall shrub with brilliant yellow 

flowers--and then by lodgepole pine. Luckily for the butterfly, it is also 

linked to a second species: Homo sapiens. Preferring to hunt in open 

fields, Native Americans periodically set fire to the grasslands, stopping 

the natural succession to brush and pine. The violets, a pioneering 

species, sprang up again after each burn, and in this way the butterfly 

flourished for centuries. Only in the 1930s did the silverspot meet its 

nemesis: Smokey Bear. The U.S. Forest Service campaigned against fires, 

and the ecological succession from grasslands to forest began anew. Scotch 

broom overwhelmed the six

inch violets, and with them the butterfly. Although development has joined 

ecological succession in shrinking the silverspot's habitat along the 

coast, more than nine tenths of the loss has been natural, according to 

Paul Hammond, the lepidopterist who is the principal expert on S.z. 

hippolyta. Eight small populations have managed to hang on, two of which 

are in Clatsop County. Without human intervention, Hammond told us, Mother 

Nature will expunge the butterfly from the Clatsop plains by the year 

2000.<P>

Options are limited. Because the land is far more valuable than the 

butterfly, no market will save S.z. hippolyta. It is unlikely to be the 

key to a new cancer cure, and it isn't nutritious. No nationwide group of 

amateur lepidopterists will pay admission to a silverspot park. Without 

the Endangered Species Act, the last silverspots in Clatsop County would 

already have been bulldozed out of existence. But with the act the 

butterfly has a slim chance. The law prevents private-property owners from 

acting to destroy a species. Where the threat is of natural origin as it 

is for the silverspot, nothing compels the landowners to act to reverse 

the course of nature. They can twiddle their thumbs and wait for Scotch 

broom to annihilate the insect. With a recovery priority of 9, the 

silverspot is tied for 456th place on the Fish and Wildlife Service's 

priority list. Hence no federal wildlife refuge will be established on the 

site of either of the two proposed resorts.<P>

The butterfly's existence in Clatsop County depends on finding a 

compromise that will allow the insect to be saved by its apparent enemy; 

developers. Such a compromise is one of the many solutions that Schroeder, 

working with Hammond, tried without success; it is also what Hildreth and 

Wudtke hope to devise. The notion is far from foolish. "Golf courses and 

resorts are a perfect match for the butterfly's management needs," Hammond 

says. Although the habitat would have to remain separate from the golf 

course, putting them together could still be "a win-win situation."<P>

Before 1982 such compromises were nearly impossible. Initially aimed 

mainly at poachers, the act's prohibition against killing endangered 

species gradually expanded to encompass the destruction of their habitat 

as well. People were almost completely barred from altering the territory 

of a listed species, no matter how low its numbers. (On the land belonging 

to Hildreth and Wudtke, the last survey found exactly one butterfly.) 

Developers had no reason to cooperate with the law. Recognizing the 

problem, Congress altered the Endangered Species Act to create what it 

called an opportunity for a "unique partnership between the public and 

private sectors in the interest of endangered species and habitat 

conservation." The amendment authorized the Fish and Wildlife Service to 

perform what are in effect swaps. People like Hildreth and Wudtke create a 

"habitat conservation plan," which ensures that private development will 

not hurt a species's chances of survival. If the plan is acceptable, the 

service issues an "incidental take permit," which promises that nobody 

will go to jail if a bulldozer operator inadvertently flattens a 

butterfly. The permit does not allow anyone to wipe out a species; only a 

few individuals of the species, if that, may be taken, and then just by 

accident. But it gives developers legal protection--provided that their 

plans do not imperil the species.<P>

Habitat-conservation plans are intended to reconcile private interests 

with public efforts to save species. They identify a species's needs and 

then, where necessary, redirect and scale back the developer's project. 

"If you trim away the fat, you rarely end up with an either-or situation," 

explains Michael O'Connell, a conservation biologist at the World Wildlife 

Fund and a co-author of Reconciling Conflicts Under the Endangered Species 

Act, a recent book on habitat-conservation plans. The plans are not a 

magic solution to all controversies over endangered species--a point noted 

by Michael Bean, the chairman of the Environmental Defense Fund's wildlife 

program and one of O'Connell's co-authors on Reconciling Conflicts. But, 

Bean argues, the plans are well suited to situations where urban 

development threatens an endangered species's habitat. In these cases both 

sides can get what they want, and society as a whole is well served.<P>

These hopes are unlikely to be realized with any frequency. The travails 

of Shroeder, Hildreth, and Wudtke illustrate the near-impossibility of 

such compromises. Schroeder proposed a trade: he would put a few fairways 

on existing habitat to the south, and plant violets in an area to the 

north. The Fish and Wildlife Service said neither yes nor no; it stalled, 

asking for more studies. Then Hammond discovered more butterfly habitat. 

The resort, to be economically viable, would extend into that newly found 

habitat. An honest man, Hammond reported his findings. The plan collapsed. 

No one believed that the service would expose itself to the charge of 

compromising the interests of a species. "They just sat on their hands," 

says Dennis Murphy, the conservation biologist, who is on the butterfly 

recovery team. "It was better than making a decision."<P>

Despite this unhappy history, Hildreth and Wudtke are pressing on. Last 

summer the two men showed us a color map depicting their preliminary 

habitat-conservation plan. It set aside twenty-five acres, a tenth of the 

resort, for the butterfly. Hildreth said they had spent more than $50,000 

determining the right area; another $200,000 was destined for 

environmental studies. "We'd like to think we're doing it as just part of 

good planning," Wudtke explained. Construction would be starting soon, and 

when the complex was finished the butterfly land would be managed properly 

instead of being overgrown by Scotch broom.<P>

A few weeks later Hammond listened politely to our description of their 

plan. He sat in an office full of wide wooden trays, each of which 

contained dozens of spotted butterflies mounted on pins. He was, he 

stressed, not opposed to such projects. But he thought that the area the 

two men had set aside was probably too small. They would need to add more 

land. "And then," he said, "it will get expensive."<P>

No doubt Hildreth and Wudtke will add as little as possible, and the Fish 

and Wildlife Service will find some reason to nitpick. One might call the 

resultant paralysis the silverspot syndrome: no resort, no butterfly, a 

lose-lose situation that combines the worst of both worlds.<P>

Such an outcome may not be rare. The two butterfly plans were created by 

the developers alone. A likelier route to success, according to the 

authors of Reconciling Conflicts, is to enlist the aid of local 

governments and environmental groups, all parties investing time and money 

in drafting the plan. (Among other things, this makes the plan less 

litigation-prone.) But that drives up costs substantially, and sometimes 

drives them beyond the $250,000 spent by Hildreth and Wudtke. Ultimately, 

preparation of the plan becomes so expensive that it is worthwhile only 

when the stakes are high--that is, when the value of the land in question 

is high. If land is expensive, so is setting it aside for the species, as 

many habitat conservation plans require. Near Palm Springs, California, for example, a 

plan has carved out a 17,000-acre reserve for the Coachella Valley fringe

toed lizard, using $25 million from developers, the Nature Conservancy, 

and federal and state agencies. If it survives internecine squabbling, a 

plan under development in Austin, Texas, will buy habitat for two bird, 

five invertebrate, and two plant species at a cost of more than $93 

million. Unsurprisingly, only ten habitat-conservation plans have been 

accepted in the past nine years.<P>

More important, the plans are only a means of choosing how to save a 

species. They do not decide whether to save it. In the eyes of the law, 

listing a species is equivalent to making that decision; if human plans 

threaten the species, they must be set aside. Conservationists often claim 

that such stark conflicts will be uncommon. (Peter Raven, the director of 

the Missouri Botanical Garden, has argued that trade-offs are "truly 

necessary" only in "rare cases.") But the United States has thousands of 

people like Richard Schroeder and it has thousands of endangered species. 

Inevitably, they will collide--everywhere and often. In these fights, 

according to the law, only one side is supposed to win.<P>

Technically, losers do have one hope: the God Committee. But it can be 

convened only when the controversy involves the federal government; if 

private developers do not need federal permits, there is no avenue of 

appeal. In practice even this limited way out is rarely used, because 

making the appeal places the appellant in the unenviable position of going 

on record as wanting to do in a species. Few wish to be seen that way-

one reason that the God Committee has been called on only three times in 

the fourteen years of its existence. (The third appeal occurred just last 

September, pitting the Bureau of Land Management against the northern 

spotted owl. A decision is expected later this year.)<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>A</font>S a practical matter, endangered species almost always win in conflicts 

with development--an outcome that flows from the act's grounding in the 

Noah Principle. Yet the Noah Principle makes choices next to impossible, 

and in this regard the Endangered Species Act must be changed. In the eyes 

of the law all species are equal, because each is of incalculable worth. 

Americans are willing to set aside some human concerns to save the bald 

eagle and the grizzly bear. But no one has demonstrated that they will 

give their informed consent to laws that grant the same privileges to the 

Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle. Indeed, a casual glance through the 

magazines of the environmental movement reveals a marked preference for 

charismatic megafauna over creepy-crawlies; the pages of Sierra and 

National Wildlife are devoted to lush color photographs of mammals and 

birds. As a result, funding for species preservation is awarded with 

blithe disregard for the principle of equality. On the infrequent 

occasions when the Noah Principle is invoked, it creates contempt for the 

law. If society prefers charismatic megafauna, priority should be given to 

them without apology. If biologists think otherwise, it should fall to 

them to change public preferences.<P>

More important, the claim of incalculable value forces all sides into 

acting as if cost meant nothing. Powerful interests don't want endangered 

species anywhere near them, yet the law states with great specificity that 

their wishes are not to be heeded. The situation invites hypocrisy. 

Thousands of jobs and billions of dollars are at stake, and economic 

considerations WILL be heard. Unable to get in the front door 

legitimately, money and influence sneak in through the back. (The same 

Congress that declared endangered species to be of "incalculable" value 

evaded the intent of the act by allocating little for their welfare, and 

subsequent Congresses have not done much better.) Many species never make 

it onto the list for fear of the consequences--not to the species but to 

the economic and political forces that may be crimped if they are listed. 

And little wonder, for those who cannot prevent listing are forced, 

actively or passively to restore the species for the enjoyment of the rest 

of society. Compensating them for their costs may not, as some economists 

claim, be the easiest resolution. But it would stop the law from turning 

property owners into the enemies of the endangered species on their land. 

Without the support of property owners, the "incalculable" value of 

species will eventually become a chimera.<P>

The thought of deliberately consigning any species to extinction, let 

alone thousands of them, is repugnant, and no one we spoke to liked it. 

(Asked if he would like to see the silverspot vanish, Schroeder looked 

surprised. "Of course not," he said.) But we will inevitably cause 

extinctions; we cannot hide from it. Taking responsibility for our actions 

is a better course than letting species die of our indecision. To pretend 

that we are acting to save everything is intellectually dishonest. It 

turns the hard choices over to the forces of litigation and bureaucratic 

inertia. Clinging to the Noah Principle may make us feel good, but it 

ensures that the nation's biological heritage will be managed, as Lewis 

Carroll would have had it, by Helter and Skelter.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



Last June we drove down the coastal highway to Richard Schroeder's 

proposed golf course. We found it just north of a gas station and across 

from a driving range, as Schroeder had said. A dirt road led into the 

property; we took it, rocking through the ruts left by four-wheel-drive 

vehicles. In a moment we came to a cow pasture: prime butterfly territory. 

Dotted with the bright-yellow blossoms of Scotch broom, the field was a 

sad sight--if you were interested in butterflies. The owner, one of 

Schroeder's neighbors, wants to retire after decades on the farm. He is 

waiting for the shrub to take over. Then, maybe, the land can be sold for 

condominiums.<P>

It was too early in the season to see silverspots. We looked anyway--but 

of course we didn't find them.<p>

	<font size=5>I</font>t was "noble, revolutionary--and probably the most thoughtless of the many

acts of the Great Society." Thus did Theodore White, chronicler of all that is

brave and optimistic about America, assess in 1982 the thing his country had

done to itself seventeen years earlier. He was not talking about the decision

to increase the commitment of American ground forces to South Vietnam, nor

about the beginning of programs that would end in racial quotas and

school-busing orders, nor about the inauguration of Medicare and other benefits

whose costs the public would in the 1980s be struggling to pay. Rather, this

most thoughtless gesture was the Immigration and Nationality Act amendments of

1965.<p>



<p>



<p>



The new laws were not expected to increase the flow of immigrants to this

country. Indeed, for the first time in America's history, they put limits on

the numbers that could enter from Mexico, the Caribbean, and elsewhere in the

Western Hemisphere. But the laws did revolutionize the nature of the immigrant

population. Back in the 1920s, when the U.S. first placed limits on the number

of immigrants it would accept, the central principle of immigration policy was

that America's new citizens should resemble its old ones. Under the

"national-origins" system introduced in 1921, quotas for European immigration

preserved the "racial preponderances" within the American population. Ireland,

for example, could send each year 3 percent as many immigrants as there were

foreign-born Irish-Americans counted in the U.S. Census of 1910. (In 1924, the

quotas were made more restrictive. They were set at 2 percent of the ethnic

representation among Americans, foreign-born and native-born, shown in the 1890

Census. ) The national-origins system was designed as a shield against the "New

Immigration" of Poles, Italians, Slavs, and Eastern European Jews.<p>



<p>



<p>



With the Immigration Act amendments of 1965, the United States announced that

it would look impartially on the world. The Ethiopian, the Turk, the resident

of Calcutta or Rangoon, would compete on equal footing with the Englishman and

the German. America would open itself not merely to the tired and the poor but

to the racial and ethnic balance of the wide world. The result, wrote Theodore

White, was "a stampede, almost an invasion." The "sources of fresh arrivals

[would be] determined not by those already here, but by the push and pressures

of those everywhere who hungered to enter."<p>



<p>



<p>



Those pressures are sobering to contemplate. According to the International

Labour Organization, the total labor force of the Third World countries will be

600 million to 700 million people larger in the year 2000 than it was in 1980.

To employ all those additional workers, the developing countries would have to

create more jobs than now exist in Western Europe, Japan, the United States,

the Soviet Union, and the other industrialized nations combined. Obviously,

that will not happen, and some of those who cannot find work, especially in

Latin America, will decide to leave.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Especially" Latin America because the riches of the United States lie within

easy reach of so much of Central and South America, and because population

growth there is exceptionally fast. The combined population of the Latin

American nations was about 150 million in the early 1950s. It is expected to be

845 million by 2025. Half of the people in Latin America are eighteen years old

or under; they will be entering the labor force, looking for work in their

countries or ours, in the next generation. Robert Fox, of the Inter-American

Development Bank, points out that the total Latin American labor force is now

about 115 million, but will be 197 million twenty years from now. "This is

intractable," he has said. It is based on a population already born. Latin

American countries would have to create an average of 4 million new jobs each

year until 2025 [to accommodate the growth]. The U.S., with an economy five

times larger, averages 2 million new jobs per year."<p>



<p>



<p>



Regardless of these projections, the flow of immigrants from the Third World

has already begun. From 1930 to 1960 about 80 percent of America's immigrants

came from European countries or Canada. From 1977 to 1979, 16 percent did, and

Asia and Latin America accounted for about 40 percent each. In 1979, the nine

leading "source" countries for legal immigration were Mexico, the Philippines,

Korea, China and Taiwan, Vietnam, India, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and

Cuba. In tenth place, with 3 percent of the total, was the United Kingdom.<p>



<p>



<p>



The structure of the immigration code meant that the Third World's share of new

Americans was likely to increase. Under the post-1960 law, places in the

immigration queue are assigned with grand indifference to ethnic origin but

with careful attention to family ties. The immediate relatives of American

citizens--parents, minor children, and spouses--are admitted without limit. In

recent years, some l00,000 people have entered this way annually. In addition,

the law provides for 270,000 immigrants each year (no more than 20,000 from any

one country) in the "numerically limited" categories, which heavily favor less

immediate relatives. Eighty percent of the 270,000 places are allotted to the

adult children or the brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens, plus the immediate

relatives of non-citizens who are here as permanent resident aliens. The

remaining places go to those with skills considered valuable to the American

economy, or to those who would simply like to come. The law's premium on family

connections means that each new arrival from the Philippines or Korea

eventually makes many others in those countries eligible for admission.<p>



<p>



<p>



Beyond this change in the mix, there has been a change in numbers. In 1980, at

least 125,000 Cubans and Haitians arrived in southern Florida and were admitted

as "special entrants," a category invented to cope with the influx. Since 1975,

the U.S. has accepted over half a million refugees from Indochina. More than

160,000 came in 1980 alone, which together with the Cubans and Haitians pushed

that year's total for legal admissions to 808,000, the highest in sixty years.

<p>



<p>



<p>



And this is to speak only of lawful entrants. As Latin America's population has

grown and its governments and economies have foundered, more and more of its

people have looked northward for relief. In the mid-1970s, the commissioner of

the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Leonard Chapman, said that there

might be as many as 12 million foreigners here illegally. Official estimates

are now 50 to 75 percent lower than that, but no one can say with confidence

how many illegal aliens are here and how many more are coming. In many of the

big cities of the north, throughout the southwestern states, and in the

labor-intensive farming regions of the east and west coasts, daily life

provides signs of the illegal tide. Early this year, the attorney general of

the United States, William French Smith, proclaimed, "Simply put, we've lost

control of our own borders."<p>



<p>



<p>



As the immigrants continue to arrive, the alarm bells have begun to ring. From

liberals and conservatives alike have come warnings about the implications of

the trend. Clare Booth Luce, the venerable Republican, has said that the

immigrants will be more difficult to absorb because they are not white. Carl

Rowan, a black Democrat, has written about the "immigration nightmare." Ray

Marshall, secretary of labor in the Carter Administration, has claimed that we

could worry much less about unemployment if we got rid of illegal immigrants.

Jesse Helms and Paula Hawkins, two of the most conservative members of the U.S.

Senate, have argued that if the U.S. doesn't help defeat the guerrillas in El

Salvador, we will be flooded with Salvadoran refugees, as we were with refugees

from Vietnam. Labor leaders have issued statements saying that immigrant

workers are stealing Americans' jobs.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Our immigration policy is making us poorer, not richer" Richard Lamm, the

Democratic governor of Colorado, said this year. "It is dividing our wealth and

resources." Last year, Lamm contended that America's economic "pie" had stopped

growing and that "the unchanging pie dramatically alters an issue like

immigration, for now additional people will have to take from that pie rather

than contribute to it. . . . Who needs additional people when we cannot employ

our own citizens?"



After many months of travel through the parts of the United States most

affected by immigration, it is clear to me that something big is going on. To

see Koreans, Vietnamese, and Cambodians contending for places with the

Mexicans, Salvadorans, blacks, and "Anglos" of Los Angeles is to glimpse what

New York must have been like when Ellis Island was more than a monument. To

examine Miami's recent economic, political, and social history is to see Cuban

and Haitian immigration as the event around which all others turn. In countless

other places, from Brooklyn to rural Wisconsin, from Houston to Orange, New

Jersey, the words heard in the air, the clothes and faces seen on the street,

the courses taught in the schools, have all changed because of immigration.<p>



<p>



<p>



But it is far from clear to me that the changes under way are ominous or bad.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The best-known "facts" about today's immigration are, in many cases, not facts

at all. Because of the 808,000 people who were admitted legally in 1980,

politicians and authorities have suggested that the U.S. is experiencing an

unprecedented foreign flow. A well-respected immigration expert, Michael

Teitelbaum, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has written in

*Foreign Affairs* that "immigration and refugee flows to the United States in

the late 1970s were at or near the highest levels ever experienced...."<p>



<p>



<p>



This is hyperbole. The year 1980 was the recent peak. One year later, after the

Cuban and Haitian boatlift was over, and after the greatest surge of

Indochinese refugees had passed, legal immigration fell to 697,000. By

contrast, it was 1.2 million in 1907, and exceeded one million in five other

years near the turn of the century. Today's figures do not include illegal

immigrants, but the figures from the turn of the century (when there were few

illegals) do not include anyone who arrived legally by ship in cabin class or

by land, from Canada or Mexico.<p>



<p>



<p>



Since the American population was so much smaller early in the century, the

relative impact of immigration was far greater then. From 1880 to 1890, and

again from 1900 to 1910, the average annual flow of counted immigrants was

equal to more than one percent of the American population. From 1970 to 1979,

it was *one-fifth* of one percent. The foreign-born made up 4.7 percent of the

population in 1970; they made up 8.8 percent in 1940 and 14.8 percent in

1910.<p>



<p>



<p>



Many politicians and experts assert that the U.S. is unique in its

vulnerability to immigration. Governor Lamm, for example, says that "the

unemployed...will never get jobs as long as we continue to take in twice as

many immigrants as the rest of the world combined." The "twice as many"

calculation simply fails to count nearly one million Ethiopian refugees who

have fled to Somalia (a nation of 4 million people) and the 1.5 million Afghans

displaced into Pakistan. In normal years, the U.S. does admit more immigrants

and refugees than any other country, but Canada and Australia have accepted

more relative to their population sizes. From 1956 to 1978, the U.S. never

received more than 2.8 legal immigrants for each thousand in its population.

During the same period, Canada's rate was as high as 17 per thousand, and

Australia's rate was as high as 15.1.<p>



<p>



<p>



Yet statistics are at best a crude indication of people's real concerns about

immigration, and a statistical rebuttal is not enough. "It is difficult to

explain to residents of the community that the Indochinese refugees are drying

skinned cats out on the clothes line because they enjoy cats as a delicacy in

their country," the mayor of Santa Ana, California, told a congressional

committee in 1981. It is difficult to feel at ease about the impact of the new

arrivals, difficult to guess whether the cultural fabric will stretch, as it

has before, or finally be torn.<p>



<p>



<p>



The unspoken question about the immigrants is *What are they doing to us?* Will

they divide and diminish the nation's riches? Will they accept its language?

Will they alter racial relations? Will they respect the thousand informal rules

that allow this nation of many races to cohere?<p>



<p>



<p>



MONEY<p>



<p>



Economists who study the effects of immigration take two very different

approaches. One school views immigrants primarily as additional people--new

workers in the labor force, extra purchasers in the national market. From this

perspective, immigration can sometimes be valuable, if the labor it provides

alleviates a shortage. Thus Western Europe needed immigrant "guest workers" to

ease its labor shortage in the 1960s. And thus, contends the economist Julian

Simon, immigrants can help the United States. The value of immigrants Simon

says, is that they "represent additional *people* as people...[and] lead to

faster economic growth by increasing the size of the market, and hence boosting

productivity and investment." In addition, since so many of the immigrants are

young, they can help offset the aging of the American work force. Most of those

who see immigration from the labor-market perspective conclude, unlike Simon,

that immigrants hurt a mature economy like that of the United States. If the

immigrants are uneducated and unskilled--farmers, peasant craftsmen--they will

drag down the overall productivity rate. They will, in effect, more narrowly

divide the economic pie.<p>



<p>



The other economic approach pays little attention to how many immigrants

arrive. It concentrates instead on the economic behavior of those who survive

the process of migration. This view is propounded by economists who place great

stress on "human capital," the mixture of talents and cultural incentives that

makes Germany economically different from England and Hong Kong from Macao.

From this perspective, the ingenuity and perseverance that immigrants possess

can make an economy richer, because immigrants will adapt and innovate and

sacrifice in ways that non-immigrants are too comfortable to try. They make the

pie larger for everyone to share.<p>



<p>



<p>



I came to find the second approach more realistic, for reasons I can best

present through the story of the Nguyen family, formerly of Saigon, now of Los

Angeles.<p>



<p>



<p>



In 1975, the four brothers and six sisters of the immediate Nguyen family lived

in Saigon with their parents plus the extended family of nephews and

brothers-in-law. The father ran a small import-export business. The children

held clerical or professional jobs. Two were in the Army of the Republic of

Vietnam (ARVN); one of them had been a law student before he was drafted. One

son was an architectural draftsman, and one was a lawyer. Two daughters worked

as secretaries, one in a South Vietnamese government ministry, the other at the

U.S. Embassy. Although the family was not part of Saigon's moneyed elite, it

was respectably successful. Because of the daughter who worked for the

Americans, the family was on a list of people the U.S. planned to evacuate if

Saigon fell.<p>



<p>



<p>



In the chaos that engulfed Saigon in April of 1975, the onetime law student,

Mr. Nguyen, was the first of the family out of Saigon. (He has asked that his

given name not be used) How did he escape? "In panic," he says. He made his way

to Tan Son Nhut airport, where the rescue helicopters were supposed to land. He

was thirty years old and spoke no English.<p>





Mr. Nguyen was taken to Clark Air Base in the Philippines, then to Guam, and

eventually to a resettlement base at Camp Pendleton, California. There he spent

the next six months. In camp, he volunteered to work for the U.S. Catholic

Conference, which was (and remains) heavily involved in resettling refugees. In

time he came to be paid $5 a day for helping to coordinate the many details in

finding homes for the refugees. When the camp closed, at the end of October,

1975, he was the last refugee released.<p>



<p>



<p>



Across the vast expanse of the Los Angeles basin Mr. Nguyen traveled in search

of work. His first break came in November. In El Segundo he found work as an

assembler in a waterbed factory, for $2.10 an hour, then the minimum wage.

After Mr. Nguyen had accepted the job, the foreman asked him for his address.

"I told him I didn't know, because I didn't live any place yet. I was only

going to rent a place after I got a job."<p>



<p>



<p>



Mr. Nguyen had his first foothold, but not much more than that. He was taking

home less than $400 per month, and was paying $120 for his room. On leaving the

camp, Mr. Nguyen had been entitled to $300 for resettlement expenses, but he

had refused the money. "I had pride. I wanted to feel that I had made it

without any help," he says. "But I felt lonely and miserable. In those

factories, you can't slow down." He was buoyed only by his glimpses of other

Vietnamese adjusting to industrial life. "You see one person in the corner, he

might have been a farmer in Vietnam. He survived, I can survive."<p>



<p>



<p>



Three weeks later, he heard of another possibility, an opening with RCA. On his

time off, he went to the RCA record factory and said that he'd had experience

with studios and music back in Vietnam. The personnel man listened with feigned

attentiveness and told him that he sounded like the man for the job. When Mr.

Nguyen reported for work, he found that he would be putting labels on records

for $3 an hour.<p>



<p>



<p>



"I learned that money is really valuable in this country," he says. "You pay

for it with blood and tears. I started thinking about that $300. Money is

money. Why not collect it and put it in the bank and earn interest instead of

just ignoring it?"<p>



<p>



<p>



Having steeled himself to claim his resettlement bonus, Mr. Nguyen went into a

religious-charities office to apply. While there he ran into the resettlement

director, who knew of his work in the camp. The charities were looking for a

man like him, she said. Mr. Nguyen started to tell her he couldn't speak

English well enough, but she shushed him with the reassurance that he'd be put

in a training program. The pay would be $660 a month. He accepted. By the end

of 1975, Mr. Nguyen was a white-collar worker.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Meanwhile, the rest of the family has adapting to life in the newly christened

Ho Chi Minh City. Nguyen Ninh, the brother who had been a draftsman, escaped

purges directed at other technicians because, as he remembers now, "they needed

our skills to make the machinery run." Yet he suspected that sooner or later

his usefulness would end. One of his brothers named Viet, had been a lieutenant

in the South Vietnamese Army and was being held in a "re-education camp." When

Viet escaped from the camp, after two years' detention, he joined Ninh in a

plan to flee the country.<p>



<p>



<p>



With friends, the brothers bought an old boat from country people and then

covertly brought it to the city to fortify it for an ocean voyage. None of them

had been on the water, but they tried to teach themselves seamanship. One night

in 1977, they set out, seven people in a boat that Nguyen Ninh says was not

more than twelve feet long.<p>



<p>



<p>



They hoped to reach Malaysia, but the winds blew hard from that quarter. On the

eighth day at sea, the boat's engine failed, and they drifted where the wind

pushed them.<p>



<p>



<p>



"After the broken engine, we figure 99 percent that we die in the ocean," Ninh

said this spring. "Nearly everyone who goes in a boat dies." Commercial ships

passed, but they kept on going, some even adjusting their course so as to avoid

entanglement with the troublesome boat people. The boat began to leak, and then

it sank. The men were in the water, swimming, reckoning their remaining time in

hours.<p>



<p>



<p>



In the distance, a large, dark shape loomed. It was a freighter from Kuwait.

Its captain, looking through his binoculars, was startled by the sight of men

swimming in the ocean. When rescued, they were 200 miles from Vietnam.<p>



<p>



<p>



They had avoided death, but for the next year the two Nguyen brothers lived as

stateless men. Immigration officials would not let them go ashore at the ship's

next stop, Singapore. They lived aboard ship till it returned to Kuwait, and

when it got there they were jailed. Its next voyage was to Vietnam, they were

told, and it would take them back home. The brothers tried to reach embassies,

the Red Cross, the UN, but they got nowhere until a sailor agreed to mail a

letter to Mr. Nguyen in California.<p>



<p>



<p>



With efforts under way in Los Angeles and Kuwait, the men were classified as

refugees and, after three months in jail, were turned over to the UN. They

spent eight more months in a UN refugee camp in Greece, where they worked as

farm laborers. After Mr. Nguyen was certified as their sponsor in the U.S.,

they were accepted as refugees. On June 22, 1978, they arrived in America.<p>



<p>



<p>



Like their brother, they spoke no English on arrival, but they began learning

as they looked for work. Beyond supporting themselves, they hoped to send money

to the family members still in Vietnam, to help them buy their way out. Viet,

the former ARVN lieutenant, got a job at a valet-parking outfit at the Los

Angeles International Airport, for the minimum wage. Ninh became a carpenter's

helper. A few months later, he found a place as a trainee draftsman with a

machine-tool company.<p>



<p>



<p>



Four sisters and a nephew were the next Nguyens to come over. They went by boat

to a refugee camp in Indonesia. In 1979, they joined their brothers in Los

Angeles.<p>

<p>



<p>



Then the other two sisters escaped. One, Hai, had been a student; the other,

Mai, had worked at the U.S. Embassy. In 1980 they set out on foot. With two

children, they traveled west to Cambodia and then walked for seven days through

the jungles of Cambodia to the Thai border. In Thailand, they were admitted to

a refugee camp. There they stayed for six months. In 1980, with Mr. Nguyen

acting as their sponsor, they entered the United States. They were among the

808,000 admissions that alarmed many Americans that year.<p>



<p>



<p>



The family with which they were reunited had changed dramatically in the

previous five years. Mr. Nguyen had become a citizen and was married to another

Vietnamese immigrant. He and the other brothers were established in a way that

would have been hard to imagine when they first arrived, as dispossessed

persons. They had assimilated so fully as to see that in Southern California in

the late seventies, the road to financial independence was real estate. After

Ninh and Viet arrived, in 1978, the three brothers had pooled their money in

hopes of buying a house. Each of them was eventually bringing home about $1,000

a month; by sharing living expenses, they saved about $2,000 a month. By 1979,

they had accumulated enough for a down payment on a house in Downey, a

respectable middle-class suburb. All three signed the mortgage.<p>



<p>



<p>



Viet had saved enough money from his work at the parking lot to buy a small

furniture store, too. As he was contemplating the investment, he told Mr.

Nguyen that it would consume all his savings. Mr. Nguyen replied that if he

lost the money, he could always earn it back, but if the gamble paid off, he'd

be independent. Ninh was by then earning $10 an hour as a professional

draftsman.<p>



<p>



<p>



Mr. Nguyen, the Benjamin Franklin of the family, encouraged his sisters to

train for better jobs. Hai took a course in accounting and wound up working for

a Vietnamese dentist in Long Beach. Mai studied cosmetology. She did not like

it, but her brother pushed her to see it through. She finished, and found a job

in West Los Angeles. She made the sixty-mile commute daily, and by the end of

1980 she was earning $2,000 a month doing nails. By 1982, she had a chance to

buy her own salon. The family pooled its assets and took out loans, and now she

runs Mai's Beauty Salon, in Beverly Hills, hard by Rodeo Drive. The family's

father finally arrived, having first escaped to Belgium and established himself

as a baker.<p>



<p>



<p>



All the while, Mr. Nguyen was improving his own position. He rented the house

in Downey to other members of his family, eight siblings and in-laws. They pay

$100 a month apiece, which covers the mortgage. Mr. Nguyen has moved with his

wife to a second house. They have carefully worked out their financial

timetable. In a few years, they will have retired the second mortgage on their

home, and his wife can quit her job as a chief bank teller to have children.<p>



<p>



<p>



When I went to visit the house in Downey, home to nearly a dozen people,

counting the children, I was prepared for a sense of confinement, or of brave

endurance amid squalor, or of practically anything except the serene order I

found. It sits amid other unexceptional, modern California houses, with a vista

of a distant freeway, on a street like a thousand others in the Los Angeles

basin. Inside the house, the sisters and brothers, arriving late after long

commutes from their farflung businesses, changed quickly into Vietnamese

pajamas and kimonos and took their leisure in the living room. Delicately

colored prints of Asian scenes hung on the walls. The dining table stood on a

platform with a canopy overhead, giving the effect of an indoor gazebo. The

only external indication of the struggle for advancement going on within was

the seven cars that jammed the driveway and lined the curb.<p>



<p>



<p>



The adults, thin and short, spoke in heavily accented English about their

arrivals, which in some cases were only a year in the past. Two elementary

school children, whose father was still in jail in Vietnam, appeared in

American-style pajamas and shyly answered questions in American tones. The

family is still saving money, in preparation for the mother and for the spouses

and siblings yet to arrive.<p>



<p>



<p>



Mr. Nguyen's job involves assisting many new arrivals from Indochina. He tells

them that they must adjust to the "new life" in the United States, as his

family has done. He warns them against welfare, although he says he cannot

blame people for accepting the $600 a month, plus food stamps and medical

benefits, that welfare provides. "I tell them, If you go on job training, you

will learn the English faster. Welfare will make you lazy. You will hesitate to

work and hesitate to speak English."<p>



<p>



The Nguyen family is, of course, not typical of all immigrants. Its members,

with their education and their white-collar backgrounds, started out several

steps ahead of the peasants and farmers who fled at the same time. The refugee

camps, however cheerless, and the resettlement bonuses, however small, were

more help than many other immigrants receive. Most important, the Nguyens'

status as legal, fully entitled participants in American society made it easier

for them to establish credit, buy homes, start businesses, and move up the

ladder rung by rung.<p>



<p>



<p>



Still, there *is* something in their story that is typical of immigrants'

histories. However hard it was to continue living in Ho Chi Minh City (or, in

earlier eras, Pinsk or Palermo), it took a certain daring to set out in the

boat or walk through the jungle. At worst, the emigrants would die or be

captured. At best, they would arrive as uprooted foreigners, ignorant of the

language and the mores that compose their new culture.<p>



<p>



<p>



Some theorists speculate that the act of emigration is a kind of natural

selection: those who are passive or fatalistic--or comfortable--do not take the

step. Others suggest that the rigors of the passage teach the immigrants the

skills they need to survive. In any case, there is little dispute that an

"immigrant personality" exists, and that its elements are the same ones that,

in retrospect, are so apparent in the nation's previous immigrants.<p>



<p>



<p>



Compared with people who have not been forced to land on their feet, immigrants

are generally more resourceful and determined. (A twenty-three-year-old man

from El Salvador, who had come to the U.S. illegally and was working in

Houston, told me that he could not understand all the talk about unemployment.

Why, he himself was holding three jobs.) The full story of the immigrant

personality would also include the psychological burdens of dislocation. But

looked at from the economic point of view, the immigrant's grit and courage,

and even his anxieties, impart productive energy to the society he joins.<p>



<p>



<p>



This is different from saying that immigrants are valuable primarily for their

specific talents. Some are, of course; the harvest ranges from Albert Einstein

to Rod Carew. But through American history, the great masses of immigrants have

not brought with them special skills. Most have come from the lower, but not

the bottom, ranks of their native societies. They are people without advantages

of birth who are nonetheless on the way up.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Those who do come to the United States are those who are advancing within

their own societies," says Ray Marshall, now of the University of Texas; "those

who have attained the necessary knowledge of America and how to get here, and

who have accumulated or been able to borrow the funds they need to pay for

their airline tickets or to pay their smugglers."<p>



<p>



<p>



The single most important quality in immigrants is the willingness to adapt.

The very traits that persuade someone to move from Guatemala to Los Angeles, or

even from Detroit to Houston, often enable the immigrant to find and fill

economic gaps, which is what the Nguyen family did, and what many other

immigrants have done.<p>



<p>



<p>



Not every immigrant becomes an entrepreneur; a man who pushed a hand plow in a

Mexican village will probably pick vegetables or wash dishes if he comes to the

United States. The more temporary the visit, the more likely the immigrant is

merely to sell his unskilled labor, rather than look for a special niche.

Economists distinguish such "sojourner" behavior from the attitude of the true

immigrant. It typified many Italian sojourners in the United States eighty

years ago and French-Canadians in New England until several decades ago, and

probably typifies most illegal immigrants from Mexico in recent years.<p>



<p>



<p>



Still, there is evidence beyond the anecdotal about the economic benefits

immigration can bring to the new homeland. The Urban Institute, which has been

conducting a study of the California economy in the 1970s, recently released

its preliminary findings:<p>



<p>



<p>



During the 1970s, when Southern California received more immigrants than any

other part of the country, it also created jobs faster than any other, and its

per capita income increased by 25 percent, also higher than the norm.

Immigration was far from the only factor in these increases, the study

reported; but, it said, the findings suggest, "at least at the aggregate level,

that large-scale immigration did not depress, and perhaps increased, per capita

income in the state"--that is, it did not divide the pie. On balance, the study

said, the economic benefits to the region--results of the new human energy, the

entrepreneurship, the adaptability-- outweighed the costs, which primarily came

from the immigrants' use of public services, such as hospitals and schools.<p>



<p>



<p>



Although immigration is a divisive issue in Miami, almost no one disputes the

economic bonus the Cuban community now represents. The first to flee Castro

were mainly professionals and businessmen, who soon repeated their success

here. The second and third waves were less select, more like America's other

immigrants; the first-wave Cubans grumbled that those who had lived under

communism had lost their drive. Still, they were absorbed into Little Havana,

where they opened shops and restaurants and kept the town alive. Miami's Cuban

population has helped make it the entrepot for Latin American trade, to the

occasional sorrow of the Drug Enforcement Administration, but to the

satisfaction of financiers.<p>



<p>



<p>



Immigrants eagerly join the American race to get ahead. According to Barry

Chiswick, of the University of Illinois, the sons and daughters of immigrants

earn 5 to 10 percent more than others of the same age and educational level

whose parents were native-born. The immigrants themselves, compared with

native-born people of the same race and with the same amount of schooling,

start out at a big earnings disadvantage. But, in a matter of years, even the

first generation catches up with and then passes the native-born. This

"earnings crossover" occurs after fifteen years for Mexican immigrants and

after eleven for black immigrants. According to Thomas Sowell, a conservative

black scholar, second-generation black-skinned West Indians in the United

States have a higher average income than native-born white Americans.<p><p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Those opposed to immigration respond to these tales of success with three

objections.<p>



<p>



<p>



The first is demographic. One by one, immigrants may add to the national

wealth, but collectively they frustrate efforts to limit America's population.

Arguments about the ultimate "carrying capacity" of America's farmland, water

supply, and other natural resources have been muted in the past decade, as

American fertility rates have fallen. But many who are concerned about

population growth naturally believe that each new immigrant puts ecological

equilibrium that much further out of reach.<p>



<p>



<p>



Those who advance this case often claim that immigration now accounts for half

the total increase in the U.S. population. That is almost certainly not true.

During the 1970s, the American population grew by less than one percent a year.

The roughly 4 million legal immigrants admitted during that decade accounted

for 21 percent of the growth. In comparison, the population grew by 2 percent

per year from 1900 to 1910, and immigrants accounted for 40 percent of the

increase.<p>



<p>



<p>



If legal and illegal immigration combined did, as many environmentalists

assert, account for half the increase in the 1970s, then there must have been

more illegal than legal immigrants during that period. No one familiar with the

subject believes that so many came. Lawrence Fuchs is a professor at Brandeis

University who was executive director of the staff of the Select Commission on

Immigration and Refugee Policy, the government body that in 1981 recommended

changes in immigration law. The Census Bureau has estimated, he says, that in

1978 between 3.5 million and 6 million illegal immigrants were present in the

U.S. Fuchs says, "Since we know that some of those have been coming since long

before 1970, and since we also know that a large proportion of them are persons

who go back and forth and are definitely not permanent residents, it is clearly

fallacious to assert a number such as 50 percent without carefully qualifying

it."<p>



<p>



<p>



The demographic argument cannot be dismissed. But if immigrants bring

adaptability to an economy, they may thereby increase the chances of finding

new ways to use and conserve resources. Environmental concern means that we

must strike a balance between two competing virtues: a sustainable population.

and the invigorating effects of immigration. Too many of the environmental

activists sound as if immigration is an unrelieved evil.<p>



<p>



<p>



The second objection concerns international equity, even morality. It starts

with the premise that immigration is a naturally selective process. Precisely

because immigrants are so industrious, it is argued, the United States should

not be skimming them from the poor nations of the world. Roger Conner, the

executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR),

told a congressional committee in 1981 that the 808,000 legal immigrants and

refugees admitted the previous year represented one five-thousandth of the

population of the world. "Out of 5,000 impoverished people, we took one, taking

the brightest, most able, most energetic, the best organized," he said. "We are

taking the cream of each social class by the standards of their society...."We

are taking the most energetic and talented."<p>



<p>



<p>



In a human family of great riches and greater deprivation, a country as

comfortable as the United States has an obligation to help. But of the varied

ways in which America might advance the interests of poor countries, closing

the door on their people seems one of the least effective, direct, or fair.<p>



<p>



<p>



"We never heard this argument from experts in economic development or from the

developing countries themselves," says Lawrence Fuchs. "We only heard it from

Americans who oppose immigration."<p>



<p>



<p>



Third, many people object to immigration because of the Americans it hurts.

Overall, the nation might gain from immigration, they concede. But the benefits

go to the most comfortable Americans, and the costs are absorbed by the least

powerful and privileged.<p>



<p>



<p>



Roger Conner is one of the foremost apostles of this view.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Conner is a compact, sandy-haired lawyer, thirty-five years old, with a

puckishly all-American look. Like many other lobbyists in Washington, he seems

to be struggling to resist grabbing his listeners by the lapels so as to be

sure they'll hear all he has to say. In the past, he channeled his enthusiasm

into the environmental movement, but, he says, he came to feel that immigration

was the biggest environmental question of all. For the past four years, as

executive director of and chief spokesman for FAIR, he has been asking

Americans to re-examine their assumptions about immigration.<p>



<p>



<p>



Conner is exasperated by the notion that you can understand the effects of

immigration by looking at the immigrants. "They are the last people you'd want

to talk with," he said this spring. "Of course it's been good for them.

Especially for the first ten years, they will work very hard. But what no one

ever does, when they're out talking with the aliens and hearing their success

stories, is talk to the people who are paying the price."<p>



<p>



<p>



Conner admits that most people may profit from immigration. The immigrants

themselves do, and so do those Americans who don't compete with immigrant labor

and therefore are free to enjoy its blessings. The benefits include fresher

food (picked by immigrant field hands, instead of by machine), more pliant

domestic service (provided by Mexican maids), smaller bills in restaurants

(with Salvadorans in the kitchen), and lower prices for new houses (because of

lower pay for the construction crew).<p>



<p>



<p>



Whom does that leave out? In Conner's view, those who pay the price are the

black teenagers, the white working-class fathers, the ambitious children of

maids and janitors, who are just as eager as any Vietnamese or Mexican to move

up the ladder but who find that the rungs have been knocked out. This is a

disaster for them but not, Conner says, for the classes that make the laws and

run the businesses.<p>



<p>



<p>



"If the illegal aliens were flooding into the legal, medical, educational, and

business occupations of this country, this problem would have received national

attention at the highest level and it would have been solved," the labor

economist Vernon Briggs, of Cornell University, has written. Lawrence Fuchs

says that according to public-opinion polls the college-educated are the only

group in favor of more immigration.<p>



<p>



<p>



The economic argument against immigration is particularly troublesome for

liberals. It pits the rest of the world's poor against the two American groups

thought to have the most to lose from increased immigration: unionized labor,

which says its wage levels would be depressed, and young, unskilled blacks, who

would be nudged out of place for entry-level jobs.<p>



<p>



At this point, it is important to emphasize the distinction, not always clearly

stated, between legal and illegal immigration. If one were searching for the

pure immigrant spirit, the place to look would be among the illegals, for every

one of them has overcome some obstacle in order to be here. But because they

cannot compete fully in the aboveboard economy (they have no legal redress if

underpaid or mistreated; they have difficulty getting loans or rising into the

white-collar world), their climb up the occupational ladder ends early. More

important, from Conner's perspective, they put unfair pressure on the American

citizens competing for similar jobs. A man outside the law will accept working

conditions a citizen would not--and should not. Once the illegal immigrant has

the job, the citizen must choose between accepting similar conditions or going

without work.<p>



<p>



<p>



What kind of work do the illegals perform? According to some academic theory,

and to the folk wisdom of the Southwest, immigrants do the jobs that Americans

"won't" do. Michael Piore, an economist from MIT, has developed a model of a

"dual" labor market: some jobs are so dirty, so onerous, so poorly paid, that

if immigrants were not there to take them, the jobs would not exist. Therefore,

the immigrants who are filling them have not really displaced anyone else.<p>



<p>



<p>



"People say, 'Why aren't blacks like the Haitians?"' says T. Willard Fair, the

president of the Urban League of Greater Miami, where Haitians now hold many of

the maid and bellman jobs in which blacks once got their start. "'Why don't

they want to work?' The Haitians are behaving the way we did thirty years ago.

We would work for anything, take any abuse in the workplace."<p>



<p>



<p>



To most of those directly involved in the industries where illegal immigrants

concentrate, it seems obvious that no one else is lining up for the jobs. Last

December, Merle Linda Wolin, of The Wall Street Journal, went to see a number

of businesses where illegal immigrants had been rounded up during the spring of

1982 in Project Jobs, a short-lived sweep against employed illegal

immigrants.<p>

<p>



<p>



At a furniture factory in Santa Ana, California, on a railroad-construction

gang in Texas, in a food-processing plant in Chicago, and at other sites of

hard work, Wolin found that American citizens had in fact turned up for the

jobs when the immigrants were gone--but soon afterward, they had quit. The pay

was too bad; unemployment compensation was, by comparison, an attractive deal.

Former truck drivers and carpenters found it humiliating to sweep parking lots

or to keep up with a racing assembly line. By the time the *Journal's* reporter

arrived, six months after Project Jobs, the plants were again full of illegal

aliens. A team of researchers, headed by Wayne Cornelius, the director of the

Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California, San Diego,

found a similar pattern in California. "The attitude of many young people is

that this is the dirty work of society," Cornelius has said, "and that people

born, brought up and educated in the U. S. shouldn't have to do it."<p>



<p>



<p>



What I learned on my tours over the same territory supported Cornelius's point.

At a packing house in San Antonio, for example, men grunted as they hauled

sides of meat from trucks into refrigerators. They disappeared as I, an Anglo

in a rented car, drove up; Project Jobs had struck here. The beefy, red-haired

foreman said that he'd be "happy" to have citizens in his work force if he

could get them. Of course, he had "no idea" whether there were any illegal

immigrants there. "It's against the law to ask." This is the convenient fiction

that permits many employers to hire an illegal work force and pretend they

haven't.<p>



<p>



<p>



The agricultural industry in California, Texas, and Florida depends more

heavily on illegal labor than any other industry does, and the growers have a

more fully developed self-justifying rationale. Many protect themselves by

saying they don't know who works for them, since the hiring is done by crew

chiefs, acting as "independent agents." In the Rio Grande Valley of Texas,

"independent" contracting means that people cross the river between 4 and 6

A.M. and stand near the bridges in Brownsville and Progreso, waiting for crew

chiefs to drive up and hire truckloads of workers for the day. In the inland

reaches of Texas and other large agricultural states, commuter labor is not so

feasible, and resident camps of illegal immigrants are an open secret. Growers

say they have no alternative: they need Mexicans (or, in Florida, Haitians) to

work the fields, because no one else would stick with the job. Americans can

get food stamps and live like kings on welfare, I was told by orange growers in

the Rio Grande Valley; but the Mexicans are grateful for the work. They are

even grateful for the piece-rate wages--40 cents for a bushel of cucumbers, 35

cents for a sack of oranges--that usually work out to well under the minimum

wage.<p>



<p>



<p>



Even Alfred Giugni, whose job is preventing illegal immigration, says the

growers may have a point. Giugni, a gigantic, mirthful man of mixed Italian and

Hawaiian parentage, is the district director of the Immigration and

Naturalization Service office in El Paso. "In the 1950s, the people picking

strawberries in Oregon were high school and college students," he says. "Now

they're Vietnamese and illegal Hispanics. The employers like it, because they

will work harder. Your high school student will work long enough to earn as

much money as he wants, and then he'll quit."<p>



<p>



<p>



In Houston, a city swollen with immigrants from the declining industrial cities

of Michigan and Indiana and the turbulent societies of Central and South

America, I spent several days talking with illegal immigrants from Mexico and

El Salvador. All had been successful by their own standards, but all operated

along the margin that separates jobs "with a future" from work Americans

"won't" do.<p>



<p>



<p>



One of the women was in her forties and was wearing a housekeeper's jacket from

an office-maintenance firm. She had been raised in El Salvador, and for several

years taught elementary school there. She came to the United States in 1970,

when she was in her late twenties, on a tourist visa. It expired after three

months, but she decided to stay. She began to work as a live-in maid for three

immigrant families who shared one house. Her pay was $40 a week plus room and

board. By 1974, she was earning $75 a week for the same work.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Next, I learn to drive, so I can make more money," she said. With more of the

city to choose her employers from, she was able to raise her rate to $125 a

week. "But I am so tired of living in. I look for other work." In 1977, she

found a job as a nighttime janitor--"bathroom lady"--in an office building.

After a month and a half there, "the company sees that I speak a little

English," she said. "They have other Latin people working there. They put me in

a supervisory position, give me $2.65 an hour. During the days, I still clean

house for $30 a day. I take the bus, and from six to ten in the evening I clean

the offices. I am working thirteen hours a day."<p>



<p>



<p>



She maintained this pace until 1981. As she had moved toward bigger, more

institutionalized employers, her treatment had improved, and she hoped to

continue that trend. She went to the employment manager at one of Houston's

best-known hotels and applied to be supervisor of the housekeeping staff. She

was eventually hired, and after several months moved to a similar position at a

new office center. She now earns and pays taxes on $18,000 a year. "Nobody ever

asks me for my paper," she says. "Never. But my wages are too low I take care

of a big place; I would be making more than $18,000 if I had my papers."<p>



<p>



<p>



I also met in Houston an eighteen-year-old with a tousle-haired country-boy

look, who was dressed in shiny black polyester trousers and a matching vest,

worn over a white-on-white shirt. He left his farming village in El Salvador

late in 1980, because, he said, "it is dangerous to be on either side." He took

buses through Guatemala and Mexico, offered *mordida*--bribes--of $10 and $20 a

shot to Mexican officials along the way, and reached the frontier near Nuevo

Laredo, Mexico, by the end of the year. He crossed the Rio Grande, which at

most places means nothing more than a wade, and hitchhiked out of Laredo to

Houston. He located friends from his village, lived with them, and found a job

at $3.40 an hour washing dishes in a well-known hotel. This wage was typical:

outside of agriculture and domestic service, I found almost no illegal

immigrants working for less than the federal minimum wage of $3.35 an hour, but

many working at the minimum or just above it.<p>



<p>



<p>



After a few days in the kitchen, the young man had heard enough from his

friends to believe that he could find a less grueling way to earn his money. He

found a job in a metal-pipe yard, which at least was outdoor work. He tried to

improve his English, and, although it is still not good, he was able to apply

for jobs in which he would deal with the public. He returned to the hotel,

where he now works as a bartender, earning $4.25 an hour.<p>



<p>



<p>



His companion, also from El Salvador, was a twenty-four-year-old with the

intense, committed look of a radical intellectual. Of the several dozen

Salvadorans I met in California and Texas, perhaps one quarter explained their

immigration in terms of political oppression and human rights. The rest said

they were hunting for work. This young man was one of the quarter. He said he

had reluctantly left his wife and child behind, because he was "Looking for a

country that would respect human rights." He took buses through Mexico until he

neared the U.S. border, then waded the Rio Grande near Brownsville. He worked

on farm-labor gangs on the vast, flat ranches of South Texas, hitched a ride to

Houston, and started as a minimum-wage dishwasher in a hotel, the job he still

holds. After he was established, he called for his wife to join him. She left

their first child at home with her parents. Their second child was born in

Houston late last year, a U. S. citizen.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



These dishwashers and maids think they are doing jobs most Americans would

refuse. But there is another view of illegal immigration: it holds that men and

women like those I met in Houston are displacing Americans, directly or

indirectly.<p>



<p>



<p>



Donald Huddle, of Rice University, contends that citizens do want the jobs

immigrants now hold. Huddle and other researchers surveyed the jobs that

illegal immigrants were holding when they were caught and found that they paid

from $4 to $9.50 an hour. He concluded, "These wages debunk the commonly held

notion that illegal aliens are taking only those jobs that Americans don't want

because they are so lowly paid." Vernon Briggs points out that in every broad

category of work in which illegal immigrants are found, most of the workers are

still American citizens. He says that therefore it is misleading to talk about

"immigrant work."<p>



<p>



<p>



A more fundamental objection raised to the "Americans won't do dirty work"

argument is that it ignores the dynamic aspect of economics. Perhaps it proves

nothing that citizens won't take the jobs now available in the packing house

and the tomato field; perhaps those jobs are dirty and low-paid precisely

because so much cheap labor is available to fill them. "If there were no

illegals," says Ray Marshall, "the jobs would be different."<p>



<p>



<p>



Businesses in the service sector, such as restaurants and hotels, would pass

along the modest additional cost of hiring legal help. Who would notice the

extra dollar on the dinner bill? Some farmers would be able to pass along the

extra cost of picking grapes or oranges; others would use labor more

efficiently or mechanize their fields.<p>



<p>



<p>



Still other businesses would fold, but for them the restrictionists shed no

tears. In part, they would be service "businesses," such as household help.

What would happen if the border were closed tomorrow? I asked Alfred Giugni, in

El Paso. "The only serious impact would be the maid situation," he said.

"Everything else would work out. You get the impression that the only maids who

are paid the minimum wage in El Paso are the ones who work for people in the

INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service]."<p>



<p>



<p>



The other likely casualties would be garment factories, leather works, and

other low-wage, labor-intensive businesses. "The jobs in which illegal aliens

are not displacing American workers are those jobs in which American industry

is competing with workers in newly developed countries," Dan Stein, an official

of FAIR, has written. America's future lies with a skillful work force and high

tech. "The fewer unskilled laborers there are in this country, the better off

we should be," Vernon Briggs says.<p>



<p>



<p>



In any case, Conner, Briggs, and others argue, it is a strange and greedy kind

of social arithmetic that tots up those who might hypothetically be hurt by

restriction but ignores those who are now paying the costs of uncontrolled

borders.<p>



<p>



<p>



Briggs notes government estimates that 29 million people, or nearly 30 percent

of the employed civilian labor force, work in what he calls "the kinds of

low-skilled industrial, service, and agricultural jobs in which illegal aliens

typically seek employment." He contends that "farm workers, dishwashers,

laborers, garbage collectors, building cleaners, restaurant employees,

gardeners, maintenance workers, to name a few occupations, perform useful and

often indispensable work. Unfortunately, their remuneration is often poor, in

part because there is a large pool of persons available for these jobs."<p>



<p>



"The victims of immigration are the marginal workers, with low education, who

may not be hot to work sixty hours a week," says Roger Conner. "My own life as

an employer teaches me that if an employer is looking for a minimum of hassle,

he will look past these people--unless he has a reason to have to make it work

with them. There is just enough truth to the notion that aliens make better

workers that it nourishes the stereotypes and creates a self-fulfilling

prophecy. One reason there are so few opportunities for young black people on

construction sites is that the aliens on the scene always have somebody

available to bring in with them."<p>



<p>



<p>



When Conner was a boy, in Dallas, his mother took in ironing and later did

domestic work. He cites today's counterparts of his younger self as among the

Americans the immigrant hurts. "To the extent that the initial targets of

immigrants tend to be unskilled jobs and low-skill entrepreneurial

opportunities--say a small construction company--those are the ways out of

poverty for the energetic American. The guy who wants to work his way up--to

him the immigrant is an obstacle. I would concede a gain in efficiency from

immigration, but the cost is what we lose in upward mobility from the lower

classes."<p>



<p>



<p>



Conner's "concession" distills the economic argument against immigration to its

pure form: immigrants can make the economy more efficient, but they can hurt

the American lower class. Is this grounds for closing the door? I believe

not.<p>



<p>



<p>



For one thing, the analysis may be totally incorrect. Sixty years ago,

Progressives and conservatives joined to oppose the New Immigration. The

Progressives based their argument on the damage done to America's poor. Robert

Hunter's *Poverty*, an influential Progressive tract, concluded that the

immigrant stood between the American workingman and a better life. The

Dillingham Commission, a government panel whose forty-two-volume study laid the

groundwork for the immigration laws of the 1920s, also said that immigrants

displaced American workers. Even so, the commission concluded that displaced

workers found better jobs in an expanding economy. Oscar Handlin has said of

its findings, "To the extent that immigrants contributed to that expansion,

they actually helped to lift the condition of the laborers they found already

there."<p>



<p>



<p>



Is it necessarily any different now? In Texas and California, Mexican-Americans

have been displaced by Mexican immigrants. Ricardo Romo, who teaches history at

the University of Texas, says that his parents were displaced from their

migrant laborers' jobs in South Texas. But "no one should assume that those who

leave are worse off than if they had stayed," he says. "In many cases, there is

substantial improvement when people move on. The kids go to better schools than

their parents, they get into skilled trades."<p>



<p>



<p>



Through the past decade, unemployment has been low in the very places where

immigration, legal and illegal, has been the greatest: California, Florida,

Texas. True, this is partly tautology--why would immigrants go where there were

no jobs? But it also suggests that a growing economy, even though washed by

waves of immigration, can create more opportunities for Americans than a

stagnant one that freezes competitors out.<p>



<p>



<p>



The Urban Institute's study of Southern California reported that the region's

unemployment rates for all races and age groups were lower than the national

average, and that the difference between rates for whites and for non-whites

was less than elsewhere. This was true though Southern California is rivaled

only by Miami in its concentration of immigrants and has a higher proportion of

illegals. "One can conclude that the large undocumented population in Los

Angeles did not increase unemployment among Hispanics or other groups in Los

Angeles," the report said.<p>



<p>



<p>



Even if the case against illegal immigrants is assumed to be true, is the

solution to shield the entire economy from the bracing effects of immigration?

Restrictionists often cite the case of Kemah, Texas, to suggest the tensions

that even legal immigrants create. In Kemah, the commercial fishermen who had

long worked the Gulf Coast found their waters dotted with Vietnamese in rival

boats. The Vietnamese were here legally, admitted as refugees. They had

scrimped, like the Nguyens, to lease or buy their fishing craft. The

working-class whites of the region had initially tolerated them. When the

Vietnamese "took low income jobs cleaning fish or working in restaurant

kitchens, they were acceptable," Paul D. Starr, a sociologist from Auburn

University, said recently in the Texas Observer. "But when they became

fishermen--and competitors--attitudes toward them changed....The unpleasant

fact is that the Vietnamese work harder and longer and under more difficult

conditions than do most Americans."<p>



<p>



<p>



The Vietnamese won, and American citizens lost--but they lost in the kind of

economic competition that is supposed to be the engine of capitalism. Should

the fishermen have been protected against the Vietnamese's willingness to work

longer hours? Are we ready to say that fair competition is too much for

Americans to withstand? Unless we are, there is no economic case against legal

immigration.<p>



<p>



<p>



Unfair competition is something else. Illegal immigrants, however admirable as

individuals, are unfair rivals. They are often exploited, but that is not the

real inequity. After all, they are here by their own choice. They are most

unfair to the struggling Americans who hold similar jobs. Appreciating the

immigrants' adaptability, we should welcome their lawful presence. Can anyone

contend that what the Nguyen family enjoys it has "taken" from someone else?

But recognizing the barriers that the black teenager, the white laborer, and

the Mexican-American father confront, and the strains their frustration puts on

the entire society, we should attempt to ensure that less of America's

immigration takes place outside the law.<p>



<p>



<p>

LANGUAGE<p>



<p>



Assume for a moment that legal immigrants make an economy more efficient. Does

that tell us all we need to know in order to understand their impact on our

society? A national culture is held together by official rules and informal

signals. Through their language, dress, taste, and habits of life, immigrants

initially violate the rules and confuse the signals. The United States has

prided itself on building a nation out of diverse parts. *E Pluribus Unum*

originally referred to the act of political union in which separate colonies

became one sovereign state. It now seems more fitting as a token of the

cultural adjustments through which immigrant strangers have become Americans.

Can the assimilative forces still prevail?<p>



<p>



<p>



The question arises because most of today's immigrants share one trait: their

native language is Spanish.<p>



<p>



<p>



From 1970 to 1978, the three leading sources of legal immigrants to the U.S.

were Mexico, the Philippines, and Cuba. About 42 percent of legal immigration

during the seventies was from Latin America. It is thought that about half of

all illegal immigrants come from Mexico, and 10 to 15 percent more from

elsewhere in Latin America. Including illegal immigrants makes all figures

imprecise, but it seems reasonable to conclude that more than half the people

who now come to the United States speak Spanish. This is a greater

concentration of immigrants in one non-English language group than ever

before.<p>



<p>



<p>



Is it a threat? The conventional wisdom about immigrants and their languages is

that the Spanish-speakers are asking for treatment different from that which

has been accorded to everybody else. In the old days, it is said, immigrants

were eager to assimilate as quickly as possible. They were placed, sink or

swim, in English-language classrooms, and they swam. But now the Latin

Americans seem to be insisting on bilingual classrooms and ballots. "The

Hispanics demand that the United States become a bilingual country, with all

children entitled to be taught in the language of their heritage, at public

expense," Theodore White has written. Down this road lie the linguistic

cleavages that have brought grief to other nations.<p>



<p>



<p>



This is the way many people think, and this is the way I myself thought as I

began this project.<p>



<p>



<p>



The historical parallel closest to today's concentration of Spanish-speaking

immigrants is the German immigration of the nineteenth century. From 1830 to

1890, 4.5 million Germans emigrated to the United States, making up one third

of the immigrant total. The Germans recognized that command of English would

finally ensure for them, and especially for their children, a place in the

mainstream of American society. But like the Swedes, Dutch, and French before

them, they tried hard to retain the language in which they had been raised.<p>



<p>



<p>



The midwestern states, where Germans were concentrated, established bilingual

schools, in which children could receive instruction in German. In Ohio.

German-English public schools were in operation by 1840; in 1837, the

Pennsylvania legislature ordered that German-language public schools be

established on an equal basis with English-language schools. Minnesota,

Maryland, and Indiana also operated public schools in which German was used,

either by itself or in addition to English. In *Life with Two Languages,* his

study of bilingualism, Francois Grosjean says, "What is particularly striking

about German Americans in the nineteenth century is their constant efforts to

maintain their language, culture, and heritage. "<p>



<p>



<p>



Yet despite everything the Germans could do, their language began to die out.

The progression was slow and fraught with pain. For the immigrant, language was

the main source of certainty and connection to the past. As the children broke

from the Old World culture and tried out their snappy English slang on their

parents, the pride the parents felt at such achievements was no doubt mixed

with the bittersweet awareness that they were losing control.<p>



<p>



<p>



At first the children would act as interpreters for their parents; then they

would demand the independence appropriate to that role; then they would yearn

to escape the coarse ways of immigrant life. And in the end, they would be

Americans. It was hard on the families, but it built an assimilated

English-language culture.<p>



<p>



<p>



The pattern of assimilation is familiar from countless novels, as well as from

the experience of many people now living. Why, then, is the currently

fashionable history of assimilation so different? Why is it assumed, in so many

discussions of bilingual education, that in the old days immigrants switched

quickly and enthusiastically to English?<p>



<p>



<p>



One reason is that the experience of Jewish immigrants in the early twentieth

century was different from this pattern. German Jews, successful and thoroughly

assimilated here in the nineteenth century, oversaw an effort to bring Eastern

European Jews into the American mainstream as quickly as possible. In New York

City, the Lower East Side's Hebrew Institute, later known as the Educational

Alliance, defined its goal as teaching the newcomers "the privileges and duties

of American citizenship." Although many Jewish immigrants preserved their

Yiddish, Jews generally learned English faster than any other group.<p>



<p>



<p>



Another reason that nineteenth-century linguistic history is so little

remembered lies in the political experience of the early twentieth century. As

an endless stream of New Immigrants arrived from Eastern Europe, the United

States was awash in theories about the threats the newcomers posed to American

economic, sanitary, and racial standards, and the "100 percent Americanism"

movement arose. By the late 1880s, school districts in the Midwest had already

begun reversing their early encouragement of bilingual education. Competence in

English was made a requirement for naturalized citizens in 1906.

Pro-English-language leagues sprang up to help initiate the New Immigrants.

California's Commission on Immigration and Housing, for example, endorsed a

campaign of "Americanization propaganda " in light of "the necessity for all to

learn English--the language of America." With the coming of World War I, all

German-language activities were suddenly cast in a different light. Eventually

as a result, Americans came to believe that previous immigrants had speedily

switched to English, and to view the Hispanics' attachment to Spanish as a

troubling aberration.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The term "Hispanic" is in many ways deceiving. It refers to those whose origins

can be traced back to Spain (Hispania) or Spain's former colonies. It makes a

bloc out of Spanish-speaking peoples who otherwise have little in common. The

Cuban-Americans, concentrated in Florida, are flush with success. Some of them

nurse dreams of political revenge against Castro. They demonstrate little

solidarity with such other Hispanics as the Mexican-Americans of Texas, who are

much less estranged from their homeland and who have been longtime participants

in the culture of the Southwest. The Cuban-Americans tend to be Republicans;

most Mexican-Americans and Puerto Ricans are Democrats. The Puerto Ricans, who

are U.S. citizens from birth, and who have several generations of contact with

American city life behind them, bear little resemblance to the Salvadorans and

Guatemalans now pouring northward to get out of the way of war. Economically,

the Puerto Ricans of New York City have more in common with American blacks

than with most other Hispanic groups. Such contact as Anglo and black residents

of Boston and New York have with Hispanic life comes mainly through Puerto

Ricans; they may be misled about what to expect from the Mexicans and Central

Americans arriving in ever increasing numbers. Along the southern border,

Mexican-American children will razz youngsters just in from Mexico. A newcomer

is called a "T.J," for Tijuana; it is the equivalent of "hillbilly" or

"rube."<p>



<p>



<p>



Still, "Hispanic" can be a useful word, because it focuses attention on the

major question about this group of immigrants: Will their assimilation into an

English-speaking culture be any less successful than that of others in the

past?<p>



<p>



<p>



To answer, we must consider what is different now from the circumstances under

which the Germans, Poles, and Italians learned English.<p>



<p>



<p>



The most important difference is that the host country is right next door. The

only other non-English-speaking group for which this is true is the

French-Canadians. Proximity has predictable consequences. For as long as the

Southwest has been part of the United States, there has been a border culture

in which, for social and commercial reasons, both languages have been used.

There has also been a Mexican-American population accustomed to moving freely

across the border, between the cultures, directing its loyalties both ways.<p>



<p>



<p>



Because it has always been so easy to go home, many Mexicans and

Mexican-Americans have displayed the classic sojourner outlook. The more total

the break with the mother country, the more pressure immigrants feel to adapt;

but for many immigrants from Mexico, whose kin and friends still live across

the border and whose dreams center on returning in wealthy splendor to their

native villages, the pressure is weak.<p>



<p>



<p>



Many people have suggested that there is another difference, perhaps more

significant than the first. It is a change in the nation's self-confidence. The

most familiar critique of bilingual education holds that the nation no longer

feels a resolute will to require mastery of the national language. America's

most powerful assimilative force, the English language, may therefore be in

jeopardy.<p>



<p>



<p>



It is true that starting in the early 1960s U.S. government policy began to

move away from the quick-assimilation approach preferred since the turn of the

century. After surveys of Puerto Rican students in New York City and

Mexican-Americans in Texas revealed that they were dropping out of school early

and generally having a hard time, educational theorists began pushing plans for

Spanish-language instruction. The turning point came with *Lau v. Nichols,* a

case initiated in 1971 by Chinese-speaking students in San Francisco. They sued

for "equal protection," on grounds that their unfamiliarity with English denied

them an adequate education. In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled in their favor,

saying that "those who do not understand English are certain to find their

classroom experience wholly incomprehensible and in no way meaningful." The

ruling did not say that school systems had to start bilingual programs of the

kind that the phrase is now generally understood to mean--that is, classrooms

in which both languages are used. The court said that "teaching English to the

students...who do not speak the language" would be one acceptable solution. But

the federal regulations and state laws that implemented the decision obliged

many districts to set up the system of "transitional" bilingual education that

has since become the focus of furor.<p>



<p>



<p>



The rules vary from state to state, but they typically require a school

district to set up a bilingual program whenever a certain number of students

(often twenty) at one grade level are from one language group and do not speak

English well. In principle, bilingual programs will enable them to keep up with

the content of, say, their math and history courses while preparing them to

enter the English-language classroom.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The bilingual system is accused of supporting a cadre of educational

consultants while actually retarding the students' progress into the

English-speaking mainstream. In this view, bilingual education could even be

laying the foundation for a separate Hispanic culture, by extending the

students' Spanish-language world from their homes to their schools.<p>



<p>



<p>



Before I traveled to some of the schools in which bilingual education was

applied, I shared the skeptics' view. What good could come of a system that

encouraged, to whatever degree, a language other than the national tongue? But

after visiting elementary, junior high, and high schools in Miami, Houston, San

Antonio, Austin, several parts of Los Angeles, and San Diego, I found little

connection between the political debate over bilingual education and what was

going on in these schools.<p>



<p>



To begin with, one central fact about bilingual education goes largely

unreported. It is a temporary program. The time a typical student stays in the

program varies from place to place--often two years in Miami, three years in

Los Angeles--but when that time has passed, the student will normally leave.

Why, then, do bilingual programs run through high school? Those classes are

usually for students who are new to the district--usually because their parents

are new to the country.<p>



<p>



<p>



There is another fact about bilingual education, more difficult to prove but

impressive to me, a hostile observer. Most of the children I saw were

unmistakably learning to speak English.<p>



<p>



<p>



In the elementary schools, where the children have come straight out of

all-Spanish environments, the background babble seems to be entirely in

Spanish. The kindergarten and first- to third-grade classrooms I saw were

festooned with the usual squares and circles cut from colored construction

paper, plus posters featuring Big Bird and charts about the weather and the

seasons. Most of the schools seemed to keep a rough balance between English and

Spanish in the lettering around the room; the most Spanish environment I saw

was in one school in East Los Angeles, where about a third of the signs were in

English.<p>



<p>



<p>



The elementary school teachers were mostly Mexican-American women. They

prompted the children with a mixture of English and Spanish during the day.

While books in both languages are available in the classrooms, most of the

first-grade reading drills I saw were in Spanish. In theory, children will

learn the phonetic principle of reading more quickly if they are not trying to

learn a new language at the same time. Once comfortable as readers, they will

theoretically be able to transfer their ability to English.<p>



<p>



<p>



In a junior high school in Houston, I saw a number of Mexican and Salvadoran

students in their "bilingual" biology and math classes. They were drilled

entirely in Spanish on the parts of an amoeba and on the difference between a

parallelogram and a rhombus. When students enter bilingual programs at this

level, the goal is to keep them current with the standard curriculum while

introducing them to English. I found my fears of linguistic separatism

rekindled by the sight of fourteen-year-olds lectured to in Spanish. I reminded

myself that many of the students I was seeing had six months earlier lived in

another country.<p>



<p>



<p>



The usual next stop for students whose time in bilingual education is up is a

class in intensive English, lasting one to three hours a day. These students

are divided into two or three proficiency levels, from those who speak no

English to those nearly ready to forgo special help. In Houston, a teacher

drilled two-dozen high-school-age Cambodians, Indians, Cubans, and Mexicans on

the crucial difference between the voiced *th* sound of "this" and the

voiceless *th* of "thing." In Miami, a class of high school sophomores included

youths from Cuba, El Salvador, and Honduras. They listened as their teacher

read a Rockwellesque essay about a student with a crush on his teacher, and

then set to work writing an essay of their own, working in words like

"Garrulous" and "sentimentalize."<p>



<p>



<p>



One of the students in Miami, a sixteen-year-old from Honduras, said that his

twelve-year-old brother had already moved into mainstream classes. Linguists

say this is the standard pattern for immigrant children. The oldest children

hold on to their first language longest, while their younger sisters and

brothers swim quickly into the new language culture.<p>



<p>



<p>



The more I saw of the classes, the more convinced I became that most of the

students were learning English. Therefore, I started to wonder what it is about

bilingual education that has made it the focus of such bitter disagreement.<p>



<p>



<p>



For one thing, most immigrant groups other than Hispanics take a comparatively

dim view of bilingual education. Haitians, Vietnamese, and Cambodians are

eligible for bilingual education, but in general they are unenthusiastic. In

Miami, Haitian boys and girls may learn to read in Creole rather than English.

Still, their parents push to keep them moving into English. "A large number of

[Haitian] parents come to the PTA meetings, and they don't want interpreters,"

said the principal of Miami's Edison Park Elementary School last spring. They

want to learn English. They don't want notices coming home in three languages.

When they come here, unless there is total non-communication, they will try to

get through to us in their broken English. The students learn the language very

quickly."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Bilingual education is inflammatory in large part because of what it

symbolizes, not because of the nuts and bolts of its daily operation. In

reality, bilingual programs move students into English with greater or lesser

success; in reality, most Spanish-speaking parents understand that mastery of

English will be their children's key to mobility. But in the political arena,

bilingual education presents a different face. To the Hispanic ideologue, it is

a symbol of cultural pride and political power. And once it has been presented

that way, with full rhetorical flourish, it naturally strikes other Americans

as a threat to the operating rules that have bound the country together.<p>



<p>



<p>



Once during the months I spoke with and about immigrants I felt utterly

exasperated. It was while listening to two Chicano activist lawyers in Houston

who demanded to know why their people should be required to learn English at

all. "It is unrealistic to think people can learn it that quickly," one lawyer

said about the law that requires naturalized citizens to pass a test in

English. Especially when they used to own this part of the country, and when

Spanish was the historic language of this region."<p>



<p>



<p>



There is a historic claim for Spanish--but by the same logic there is a

stronger claim for, say, Navajo as the historic language of the Southwest. The

truth is that for more than a century the territory has been American and its

national language has been English.<p>



<p>



<p>



I felt the same irritation welling up when I talked with many bilingual

instructors and policy-makers. Their arguments boiled down to: What's so

special about English? They talked about the richness of the bilingual

experience, the importance of maintaining the children's abilities in

Spanish--even though when I watched the instructors in the classroom I could

see that they were teaching principally English.<p>



<p>



<p>



In my exasperation, I started to think that if such symbols of the dignity of

language were so provocative to me, a comfortable member of the least-aggrieved

ethnic group, it might be worth reflecting on the comparable sensitivities that

lie behind the sentiments of the Spanish-speaking.<p>



<p>



<p>



Consider the cases of Gloria Ramirez and Armandina Flores, who taught last year

in the bilingual program at the Guerra Elementary School, in the Edgewood

Independent School District, west of San Antonio.<p>



<p>



<p>



San Antonio has evaded questions about the balance between rich and poor in its

school system by carving the city up into independent school districts. Alamo

Heights is the winner under this approach, and Edgewood is the loser. The

Edgewood School District is perennially ranked as one of the poorest in the

state. The residents are almost all Mexican-Americans or Mexicans. It is a

settled community, without much to attract immigrants, but many stop there

briefly on their way somewhere else, enough to give Edgewood a sizable

illegal-immigrant enrollment.<p>



<p>



<p>



In the middle of a bleak, sun-baked stretch of fields abutting a commercial

vegetable farm, and within earshot of Kelly Air Force Base, sits Edgewood's

Guerra School. It is an ordinary-looking but well-kept one-story structure that

was built during the Johnson Administration. Nearly all the students are

Mexican or Mexican-American.<p>



<p>



<p>



Gloria Ramirez, who teaches first grade, is a compact, attractive woman of

thirty-three, a no-nonsense veteran of the activist movements of the 1960s.

Armandina Flores, a twenty-seven-year-old kindergarten teacher, is a beauty

with dark eyes and long hair. During classroom hours, they deliver "Now,

children" explanations of what is about to happen in both Spanish and English,

although when the message really must get across, it comes in Spanish.<p>



<p>



<p>



Both are remarkable teachers. They have that spark often thought to be missing

in the public schools. There is no hint that for them this is just a job,

perhaps because it symbolizes something very different from the worlds in which

they were raised.<p>



<p>



<p>



Gloria Ramirez was born in Austin, in 1950. Both of her parents are native

Texans, as were two of her grandparents, but her family, like many other

Mexican-American families, "spoke only Spanish when I was growing up," she

says. None of her grandparents went to school at all. Her parents did not go

past the third grade. Her father works as an auto-body mechanic; her mother

raised the six children, and recently went to work at Austin State Hospital as

a cleaner.<p><p>



<p>



Ramirez began learning English when she started school; but the school, on

Austin's east side, was overwhelmingly Mexican-American, part of the same

culture she'd always known. The big change came when she was eleven. Her family

moved to a working-class Anglo area in South Austin. She and her brother were

virtually the only Mexican-Americans at the school. There was no more Spanish

on the playground, or even at home. "My parents requested that we speak more

English to them from then on," she says. "Both of them could speak it, but

neither was comfortable."<p>



<p>



<p>



"Before then, I didn't realize I had an accent. I didn't know until a teacher

at the new school pointed it out in a ridiculing manner. I began learning

English out of revenge." For six years, she took speech classes. "I worked hard

so I could sound--like this," she says in standard American. She went to the

University of Texas, where she studied history and philosophy and became

involved in the Mexican-American political movements of the 1970s. She taught

bilingual-education classes in Boston briefly before coming home to Texas.<p>



<p>



<p>



Armandina Flores was born in Ciudad Acuna, Mexico, across the river from Del

Rio, Texas. Her mother, who was born in Houston, was an American citizen, but

her parents had returned to Mexico a few months after her birth, and she had

never learned English. Flores's father was a Mexican citizen. When she reached

school age, she began commuting across the river to a small Catholic school in

Del Rio, where all the other students were Chicano. When she was twelve and

about to begin the sixth grade, her family moved to Del Rio and she entered an

American public school.<p>



<p>



<p>



At that time, the sixth grade was divided into tracks, which ran from 6-1 at

the bottom to 6-12. Most of the Anglos were at the top; Armandina Flores was

initially placed in 6-4. She showed an aptitude for English and was moved up to

6-8. Meanwhile, her older sister, already held back once, was in 6-2. Her

parents were proud of Armandina's progress; they began to depend on her English

in the family's dealings in the Anglo world. She finished high school in Del

Rio, went to Our Lady of the Lake College in San Antonio, and came to Edgewood

as an aide in 1978, when she was twenty-two.<p>



<p>



<p>



Considered one way, these two stories might seem to confirm every charge made

by the opponents of bilingual education. Through the trauma of being plucked

from her parents' comfortable Spanish-language culture and plunged into the

realm of public language, Gloria Ramirez was strengthened, made a cosmopolitan

and accomplished person. Her passage recalls the one Richard Rodriguez

describes in *Hunger of Memory,* an autobiography that has become the most

eloquent text for opponents of bilingual programs.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Without question, it would have pleased me to hear my teachers address me in

Spanish when I entered the classroom," Rodriguez wrote. "I would have felt much

less afraid....But I would have delayed--for how long postponed?--having to

learn the language of public society."<p>



<p>



<p>



Gloria Ramirez concedes that the pain of confused ethnicity and lost loyalties

among Mexican-Americans is probably very similar to what every other immigrant

group has endured. She even admits that she was drawn to bilingual education

for political as well as educational reasons. As for Armandina Flores, hers is

a calmer story of successful assimilation, accomplished without the crutch of

bilingual education.<p>



<p>



<p>



Yet both of these women insist, with an edge to their voices, that their

students are fortunate not to have the same passage awaiting them.<p>



<p>



<p>



It was a very wasteful process, they say. They swam; many others sank. "You

hear about the people who make it, but not about all the others who dropped

out, who never really learned," Ramirez says. According to the Mexican-American

Legal Defense and Education Fund, 40 percent of Hispanic students drop out

before they finish high school, three times as many as among Anglo students.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Many people around here don't feel comfortable with themselves in either

language," Ramirez says. Flores's older sister never became confident in

English; "she feels like a lower person for it." She has just had a baby and is

anxious that he succeed in English. Ramirez's older brother learned most of his

English in the Marines. He is married to a Mexican immigrant and thinks that it

is very important that their children learn English. And that is more likely to

happen, the teachers say, if they have a transitional moment in Spanish.<p>



<p>



<p>



Otherwise, "a child must make choices that concern his survival," Ramirez says,

"He can choose to learn certain words, only to survive; but it can kill his

desire to learn, period. Eventually he may be able to deal in the language, but

he won't be educated." If the natural-immersion approach worked, why, they ask,

would generation after generation of Chicanos, American citizens living

throughout the Southwest, have lived and died without ever fully moving into

the English-language mainstream?<p>



<p>



<p>



These two teachers, and a dozen others with parallel experience, might be wrong

in their interpretation of how bilingual education works. If so, they are

making the same error as German, Polish, and Italian immigrants. According to

the historians hired by the Select Commission, "Immigrants argued, when given

the opportunity, that the security provided them by their cultures eased rather

than hindered the transition." Still, there is room for reasonable disagreement

about the most effective techniques for bringing children into English. A

former teacher named Robert Rossier, for example, argues from his experience

teaching immigrants that intensive courses in English are more effective than a

bilingual transition. Others line up on the other side.<p>



<p>



<p>



But is this not a question for factual resolution rather than for battles about

linguistic and ethnic pride? Perhaps one approach will succeed for certain

students in certain situations and the other will be best for others. The

choice between bilingual programs and intensive-English courses, then, should

be a choice between methods, not ideologies. The wars over bilingual education

have had a bitter, symbolic quality. Each side has invested the issue with a

meaning the other can barely comprehend. To most Mexican-American parents and

children, bilingual education is merely a way of learning English; to Hispanic

activists, it is a symbol that they are at last taking their place in the sun.

But to many other Americans, it sounds like a threat not to assimilate.<p>



<p>



It is easy for Americans to take for granted, or fail to appreciate, the

strength of American culture," says Henry Cisneros, the mayor of San Antonio.

Cisneros is the first Mexican-American mayor of the country's most heavily

Hispanic major city, a tall, grave man of thirty-six who is as clear a

demonstration of the possibilities of ethnic assimilation as John Kennedy was.

Cisneros gives speeches in Spanish and in English. Over the door that leads to

his chambers, gilt letters spell out "Office of the Mayor" and, underneath,

"Oficina den Alcalde." "I'm talking about TV programs, McDonald's, automobiles,

the Dallas Cowboys. It is very pervasive. Mexican-Americans like the American

way of life."<p>



<p>



<p>



"These may sound like just the accouterments," Cisneros says. "I could also

have mentioned due process of law; relations with the police; the way

supermarkets work; the sense of participation, especially now that more and

more Mexican-Americans are in positions of leadership. All of the things that

shape the American way of life are indomitable."<p>



<p>



<p>



In matters of civic culture, many Mexican-Americans, especially in Texas, act

as custodians of the values the nation is said to esteem. They emphasize

family, church, and patriotism of the most literal sort, expressed through

military service. In the shrine-like position of honor in the sitting room. the

same place where black families may have portraits of John F. Kennedy or Martin

Luther King, a Mexican-American household in Texas will display a picture of

the son or nephew in the Marines. Every time I talked with a Mexican-American

about assimilation and separatism I heard about the Mexican-American heroes and

martyrs who have served in the nation's wars.<p>



<p>



<p>



All the evidence suggests that Hispanics are moving down the path toward

assimilation. According to a survey conducted in 1982 by Rodolfo de la Garza

and Robert Brischetto for the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project,

11 percent of Chicanos (including a large number of illegal immigrants) were

unable to speak English. The younger the people, the more likely they were to

speak English. Ninety-four percent of those between the ages of eighteen and

twenty-five could speak English, versus 78 percent of those aged sixty-six to

eighty-seven. Not surprisingly the English-speakers were better educated, had

better jobs. and were less likely to have two foreign-born parents than the

Spanish-speakers.<p>



<p>



<p>



The details of daily life in Hispanic centers confirm these findings. The first

impression of East Los Angeles or Little Havana is of ubiquitous Spanish, on

the billboards and in the air. The second glance reveals former Chicano

activists, now in their late thirties, bemused that their children have not

really learned Spanish, or second-generation Cubans who have lost interest in

liberating the motherland or in being Cubans at all.<p>



<p>



<p>



Ricardo Romo says that when he taught Chicano studies at UCLA, his graduate

students would go into the San Antonio *barrio* but could not find their way

around, so much had they lost touch with the Spanish language. At a birthday

party for a Chicano intellectual in Texas, amid *pinatas* and plates laden with

*fajitas,* a birthday cake from a bakery was unveiled. It said "Happy Birthday"

in Spanish--misspelled. There was pathos in that moment, but it was pathos that

countless Italians, Poles, and Jews might understand.<p>



<p>



<p>



With Mexico next door to the United States, the Mexican-American culture will

always be different from that of other ethnic groups. Spanish will be a living

language in the United States longer than any other alternative to English. But

the movement toward English is inescapable.<p>



<p><p>



<p>



<p>



In only one respect does the Hispanic impulse seem to me to lead in a dangerous

direction. Hispanics are more acutely aware than most Anglos that, as a

practical reality, English is the national language of commerce, government,

and mobility. But some have suggested that, in principle, it should not be this

way.<p>



<p>



<p>



They invoke the long heritage of Mexican-Americans in the Southwest. As

"Californios" or "Tejanos," the ancestors of some of these families lived on

and owned the territory before the Anglo settlers. Others came across at the

turn of the century, at a time of Mexican upheaval; still others came during

the forties and fifties, as workers. They have paid taxes, fought in wars, been

an inseparable part of the region's culture. Yet they were also subject to a

form of discrimination more casual than the segregation of the Old South, but

having one of the same effects. Because of poverty or prejudice or

gerrymandered school districts, many Mexican-Americans were, in effect, denied

education. One result is that many now in their fifties and sixties do not

speak English well. Still, they are citizens, with the right of citizens to

vote. How are they to exercise their right if to do so requires learning

English? Do they not deserve a ballot printed in a language they can

understand?<p>



<p>



<p>



In the early seventies, the issue came before the courts, and several decisions

held that if voters otherwise eligible could not understand English, they must

have voting materials prepared in a more convenient language. In 1976, the

Voting Rights Act amendments said that there must be bilingual ballots if more

than 5 percent of the voters in a district were members of a "language minority

group." The only language minority groups" eligible under this ruling were

American Indians, Alaskan natives, Asian-Americans (most significantly, Chinese

and Filipinos), and Spanish-speakers. A related case extracted from the Sixth

Circuit Court of Appeals the judgment that "the national language of the United

States is English."<p>



<p>



<p>



So it is that ballots in parts of the country are printed in Spanish, or

Chinese, or Tagalog, along with English. This is true even though anyone

applying for naturalization must still pass an English-proficiency test, which

consists of questions such as "What are the three branches of government?" and

"How long are the terms of a U.S. Senator and member of Congress?" The apparent

inconsistency reflects the linguistic reality that many native-born citizens

have not learned the national language.<p>



<p>



<p>



By most accounts, the bilingual ballot is purely a symbol. The native-born

citizens who can't read English often can't read Spanish, either. As a symbol,

it points in the wrong direction, away from a single national language in which

the public business will be done. Its only justification is the older

generation, which was excluded from the schools. In principle, then, it should

be phased out in several years.<p>



<p>



<p>



But there are those who feel that even the present arrangement is too onerous.

Rose Matsui Ochi, an assistant to the mayor of Los Angeles, who served on the

Select Commission, dissented from the commission's recommendation to keep the

English-language requirement for citizenship. She wrote in her minority

opinion, "Abolishing the requirement recognizes the inability of certain

individuals to learn English." Cruz Reynoso, the first Mexican-American

appointee to the California Supreme Court, was also on the Select Commission,

and he too dissented. America is a political union--not a cultural, linguistic,

religious or racial union," he wrote. "Of course, we as individuals would urge

all to learn English, for that is the language used by most Americans, as well

as the language of the marketplace. But we should no more demand

English-language skills for citizenship than we should demand uniformity of

religion. That a person wants to become a citizen and will make a good citizen

is more than enough."<p>



<p>



<p>



Some Chicano activists make the same point in less temperate terms. Twice I

found myself in shouting matches with Mexican-Americans who asked me who I

thought I was to tell them--after all the homeboys who had died in combat,

after all the insults they'd endured on the playground for speaking

Spanish--what language they "should" speak.<p>



<p>



<p>



That these arguments were conducted in English suggests the theoretical nature

of the debate. Still, in questions like this, symbolism can be crucial. "I have

sympathy for the position that the integrating mechanism of a society is

language," Henry Cisneros says. "The U.S. has been able to impose fewer such

integrating mechanisms on its people than other countries, but it needs some

tie to hold these diverse people, Irish, Jews, Czechs, together as a nation.

Therefore, I favor people learning English and being able to conduct business

in the official language of the country."<p>



<p>



<p>



"The *unum* demands only certain things of the *pluribus,*" Lawrence Fuchs

says. "It demands very little. It demands that we believe in the political

ideals of the republic, which allows people to preserve their ethnic identity.

Most immigrants come from repressive regimes: we say, we're asking you to

believe that government should not oppress you. Then it only asks one other

thing: that in the wider marketplace and in the civic culture, you use the

official language. No other society asks so little.<p>



<p>



<p>



"English is not just an instrument of mobility. It is a sign that you really

are committed. If you've been here five years, which you must to be a citizen,

and if you are reasonably young, you should be able to learn English in that

time. The rest of us are entitled to that." <p>



<p>



<p>



Most of the young people I met--the rank and file, not the intellectuals who

espouse a bilingual society-- seemed fully willing to give what in Fuchs's view

the nation asks. I remember in particular one husky Puerto Rican athlete at

Miami Senior High School who planned to join the Navy after he got his diploma.

I talked to him in a bilingual classroom, heard his story, and asked his name.

He told me, and I wrote "Ramon." He came around behind me and looked at my pad.

"No, no!" he told me. "You should have put R-A-Y-M-O-N-D. "<p>



<p>



<p>



RACE<p>



<p>



In much of the world, political boundaries reflect ethnic divisions that have

endured for thousands of years. Something more than loyalty to a political

system is involved in being a German, a Thai, or a Japanese. Japan, in fact,

refused to accept more than a few thousand Indochinese refugees, primarily on

the grounds that so alien an element could never be absorbed. But the United

States has enshrined the idea that ethnic origins may be surmounted or, better

still, ignored. Once Englishmen, Africans, Turks, we are all Americans now.<p>



<p>



<p>



The glory of American society is its melding of many peoples. But that has

never been an easy process. Few threads run more consistently through American

social history than concern about racial and ethnic change. Since colonial

days, members of successive ethnic groups have warned that the American

national character, embodied by their group, was endangered by incoming aliens.

The roster of groups that represent the "American" character has slowly

expanded: the original British and Dutch Protestants have been joined by

Catholics and Jews, Central and Eastern Europeans, and, most slowly and

arduously of all, people of color.<p>



<p>



<p>



Although ethnic concerns obviously remain on Americans' minds, our public

language lacks polite ways to express them. The U.S. must rely on political and

linguistic terms when it attempts to discuss the complicated web of relations

that constitute a society; it has no acceptable language with which to express

concern about changes in the ethnic makeup. Mexicans may complain that gringo

tourists have changed the character of Mexican resorts, and Saudi Arabians may

worry about the effects of American expatriates on their culture. Everyone

concedes that there is a Mexican or a Saudi character, and that Americans do

not have it. But when Americans attempt to talk about the effect of Mexican

immigrants on American society, the only terms that seem to be available are

those of racism. The exhortation inscribed on the Statue of Liberty contains no

notion of degree, no hint that immigration could change American society too

much or too fast.<p>



<p>



<p>



The United States has faced this issue once before. Its response to the New

Immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe at the turn of the century was

very different from the anti-immigrant feelings of the previous fifty years.

Nativist groups had complained about the Germans and especially the Irish

during the mid-nineteenth century, but there were few suggestions that they

were racially defective. The hostility to Italians, Slavs, and Eastern European

Jews, in contrast, was explicitly racial.<p>



<p>



<p>



The Dillingham Commission, the official government body whose research paved

the way for the national-origins quota system, published a "Dictionary of

Races" as part of the scientific findings it released in 1910. The purpose of

the dictionary, its authors said, was to ascertain "whether there may not be

certain races that are inferior to other races...to discover some test to show

whether some may be better fitted for American citizenship than others." The

experts who oversaw the dictionary's preparation, according to Oscar Handlin's

*Race and Nationality in American Life,* "agreed that there were innate,

ineradicable race distinctions that separated groups of men from one another,

and they agreed also as to the general necessity of classifying these races to

know which were fittest, most worthy of survival."<p>



<p>



<p>



By "race," these nativist intellectuals meant what would now be called

ethnicity. In 1916, a New York socialite and scientist named Madison Grant

published a book called *The Passing of the Great Race.* Grant's insight was

that the European population might be divided into three distinct races. The

Nordic race, the source of America's original British and German immigrants,

was, "all over the world, a race of soldiers, sailors, adventurers, and

explorers, but above all, of rulers, organizers and aristocrats...." The other

two European races, the Alpine and the Mediterranean, were heavily represented

in the New Immigration and were deficient in various ways. In the same spirit,

Francis A. Walker, then president of MIT, said that the New Immigrants were

"beaten men from beaten races; representing the worst failures in the struggle

for existence...They have none of the ideas and aptitudes which...belong to

those who are descended from the tribes that met under the oak trees of old

Germany to make laws and choose chieftains."<p>



<p>



<p>



Most of the quack-scientific theories used to prove the racial inferiority of

the New Immigrants make for easy sport these days. Almost no one is contending

that today's new immigrants are drawn from defective stock. If anything, the

complaint from those who must compete against them is that they are too well

equipped in the struggle for economic survival. The only group to earn

widespread opprobrium was the several thousand Cubans who were released from

prisons and mental hospitals in 1980 and sent to Miami as a small but very

noticeable part of the Mariel boatlift.<p>



<p>



<p>



While the central thesis of "racial" inferiority has no clear counterpart in

today's immigration debates, the sense of unease about racial and ethnic

differences does. The concerns Americans expressed about the New Immigration

help clarify our responses to the immigration now under way.<p>



<p>



<p>



The turn-of-the-century restrictionists agreed on a premise that seemed so

obvious to them that it was often left unstated. The premise was that different

races had certain ineradicable traits. Observe the Italian peasant in Calabria,

the Jewish peddler in Minsk, and you have seen the future of these "races" in

America, the argument went. The presumed effects on American culture ranged

from a greater dependence on central government to a reduction in the average

American's height.<p>



<p>



As post-melting-pot sociologists remind us, American ethnic groups are

different from one another. They have different religious preferences,

different eating and drinking habits, different patterns of economic success.

Ethnic identification affects our political behavior: American foreign policy,

for example, would be different if it were simply "American," and not an

amalgamation of Irish-American, Greek-American, Polish-American,

Jewish-American, Cuban-American, Afro-American, Italian-American, etc.,

views.<p>



<p>



<p>



Some people therefore wonder about the directions in which today's new groups

will push tomorrow's American culture. For example, Griffin Smith, an attorney

who is writing a book about immigration, points out that the English word

"representative" and the Spanish word "delegado" appear side by side on the

Texas ballot. "The English word exists in a matrix of history and tradition

that the Spanish counterpart does not altogether share....Whatever else Spain

gave to the New World, a sound political tradition was not high on the list.

Immigration from Latin America brings with it that tradition and culture." <p>



<p>



<p>



A theme in the early literature of restriction as strong as that of the

ineradicability of ethnic traits was the idea that Americans' land was no

longer their own, that foreign-looking people speaking foreign tongues had

usurped territory that once was comfortable and familiar. In his influential

book *Poverty,* published in 1904, the Progressive reformer Robert Hunter

wrote,<p>



<p>



"To live in one of these foreign communities [within American cities] is

actually to live on foreign soil. The thoughts, feelings, and traditions...are

often entirely alien to an American. The newspapers, the literature, the

ideals, the passions, the things which agitate the community, are unknown to us

except in fragments. During the meat riots on the east side of New York City

two years ago, I could understand nothing....A few years ago, when living in

Chicago in a colony of Bohemians and Hungarians who had been thrown out of

employment by the closing of a great industry...I felt the unrest, the

denunciation, the growing brutality but I was unable to discuss with them their

grievances, to sympathize with them, or to oppose them. I was an utter stranger

in my own city."<p>



<p>



<p>



With minor alterations for local geography and updating of the ethnic groups,

this might be the lament of English-speaking whites of Miami in the 1980s, or

of the black and white populations of Los Angeles, confronting their newly

polyglot city.<p>



<p>



<p>



Robert Hunter and his contemporaries had far more reason to feel like strangers

in their own land than most Americans do now. In their day the flow of

immigrants was far heavier, in both absolute and relative terms. Moreover, the

immigrants who were arriving in such numbers seemed more alien than even the

Cambodians and Salvadorans who have come during the 1980s. "The people who

opposed their entry--and they were more numerous and vociferous and seem to

have felt even more threatened than now--made the point that Catholics and Jews

were radically different," says Lawrence Fuchs, speaking of the New Immigration

era.<p>

<p>



<p>



Certain parts of the United States have recently felt a localized impact

approximating that of the New Immigration. First on the list would be southern

Florida, which received the 125,000 Cuban and Haitian "special entrants" in the

course of one year; second, Los Angeles; and third, cities along the Mexican

border, such as Laredo and Del Rio, where the human ripples from Mexico's

economic catastrophe first touched the United States.<p>



<p>



<p>



But through most of the country, the immigration of the past ten years has

meant a gradual change in proportions, rather than the introduction of

startlingly different populations that was so troubling early in the century.

Most Asian immigrants are concentrated in the western states, with nearly a

third of the nation's total in California alone. Although Asians are

increasingly numerous in California, they have been an evident part of the

state's population since the mid-nineteenth century, when Chinese contract

laborers were admitted to work on the railroads. Although Latin American

immigrants now also congregate in Chicago, Boston, New York, and other northern

cities, the greatest numbers of them have settled in the same southwestern

states where Mexicans and Mexican-Americans are part of the traditional ethnic

mix. Neither the Asian nor the Mexican ethnic group has always been welcomed by

the white majorities in these areas--the Chinese were the targets of

exclusionary laws in the nineteenth century--but they have been there through

the years, and their presence presumably blunts the shock effect of additional

immigration.<p>



<p>



<p>



In short, historical comparison suggests that today's immigration should not

seem as threatening as the New Immigration did. The country was able to

overcome that great dislocation; will it not overcome this one? There is an

important qualifier to the confident assumption that it will, however.

Precisely because the warnings issued by the racial theorists were taken

seriously, the New Immigration came to an abrupt halt. With the passage of the

national-origins law of 1924, the ethnic balance of the American population was

supposed to be preserved. With the coming of the Depression, immigration ceased

to be an issue at all; during the 1930s, more people left the United States

than entered it. For more than forty years, until the immigration reforms of

1966, the U.S. had what Roger Conner, of FAIR, calls a "breathing space." The

cycles of the assimilative process were able to run undisturbed for more than a

generation, slowly bringing the masses of New Immigrants into American

culture.<p>



<p>



<p>



Now there is no let-up in sight. Therefore, if there were signs that the

assimilative process was breaking down-- that immigrants were not learning

English, that they could not participate successfully in economic and political

life--there would be grounds for fearing that the society could not bear the

strain of further immigration. But if the immigrants are, as all evidence

indicates, learning the national language, respecting the rules of political

participation, and proving victorious in the economic arena, then precisely

what threat do they pose? For better and for worse, America has always been an

open, fluid, commercial culture. It has embraced those willing to play the game

its way, and today's immigrants are as willing to do so as any of their

predecessors have been.<p>



<p>



<p>



What of the embedded, "ineradicable" cultural differences that today's

immigrants may introduce? To judge them we must leave the realm of evidence and

enter that of faith. Either you believe that American society, which has

absorbed and adjusted to so much, will be overpowered by this new challenge, or

you do not. My own, purely anecdotal impression, shaped by stories like those

of the Nguyens and their Mexican and Korean and Haitian counterparts, is that

American culture will prove resilient. "I certainly don't think the shift from

Poles and Slavs to Koreans and Vietnamese is all that significant," the

historian Stephan Thernstrom, of Harvard, told Barry Siegel, of the Los Angeles

Times, last December. "That's not to say there are no strains, but nothing now

portends what the country went through in the mid-nineteenth century and the

start of the twentieth century."<p>



<p>



<p>



We are left, then, with the nasty question of how much resistance to

immigration arises merely from color prejudice. Some of it undoubtedly does.

This is an atavistic emotion, part of American history and perhaps even of

human nature. But it is ugly and ignoble, and it deserves no reflection in

American law.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



At the bottom of all fear of strangers, especially those of a different color,

is the idea that they will remain a culture apart, separated by race and

behavior and aspirations from the surrounding society. The most sobering

impression left by my exposure to today's immigrants--not at all what I started

out looking for-- is the reminder that such a culture already exists, and it is

not made of those new to our shores.<p>



<p>



<p>



Immigrants rarely get their start in the middle-class enclaves and the

high-rent districts. When they move to a city, they settle in today's

equivalents of New York's Lower East Side. In most cities, that means that

Cubans and Vietnamese are moving into areas that for at least a generation have

been home to American blacks. There they do their best to establish themselves.

Predominantly black areas of Long Beach, for example, are becoming centers for

Cambodian and Vietnamese merchants, doctors, and dentists. From such proximity,

poisonous relations have grown.<p>



<p>



<p>



To many American blacks, it seems obvious that the immigrants, so new to the

country, have been more warmly treated than the blacks, who have been here all

along. Marvin Dunn, a black psychologist at Florida International University,

in Miami, says, "When the first wave of Cubans moved in, there was a deep

resentment at all the financial assistance and resettlement aid the government

was giving them, at the expense of social programs for people who had been

living here. Now there is resentment at a system that would prefer to hire

Haitians because they work more cheaply and complain less." Many blacks also

point out that the jobs as porters, maids, parking-lot attendants, and hotel

workers which their teenagers might otherwise hold are being filled by

immigrants.<p>



<p>



<p>



For their part, Dunn says, "The Haitians have a sense that we complain too

much, that our children are out of control, that we don't do enough for

ourselves." From Asian refugees, from Cubans, from black-skinned immigrants

from the Caribbean, I heard blunt, ungenerous assessments of the black

Americans among whom they lived. The contrast is probably sharpest in Miami,

where, compared with American blacks, one immigrant group, the Cubans, is

economically so successful, and another, the Haitians, seems better loved by

the Anglo and Cuban communities, despite its dark skin. The Haitians may live

four to a room in ramshackle boarding houses; they may have difficulty finding

work, except on the labor gangs in central Florida's vegetable-growing regions.

Still, they seem hopeful, determined, convinced that they can make a better

life for themselves. "These Haitian families are very hardworking, moonlighting

two or three jobs," said a white woman who coordinates Creole bilingual

education at a heavily Haitian school. "They have a lot of confidence in the

system, they have a lot of trust in the schools. Much more so than many

American blacks, who have lost faith in the system."<p>



<p>



<p>



The immigrants are on their way up, their children guaranteed a better life

simply because they will be raised in Los Angeles or Miami instead of Pnompenh

or Port-au-Prince. Their optimistic faith that hard work will be rewarded is

precisely what is lacking among the black teenagers and young mothers with whom

the immigrants share the inner-city streets.<p>



<p>



<p>



Such an absence of faith cannot be incomprehensible when legalized segregation

is but one generation in the past, when extralegal discrimination lives on, and

when official policies, especially those built into the welfare system, imply

that such people cannot really be expected to take responsibility for their

fates. Still, the fact remains that the culture of the black underclass leaves

its members worse equipped for economic advancement than immigrants who start

out with less.<p>



<p>



<p>



With some exceptions, such as the criminal minority among the Marielitos,

immigrants do not engage in crime and violence. Although fathers often leave

their wives and children behind when they migrate in search of work, they

typically send money home for support. When I asked young men from Mexico or

Haiti about the families they left behind, I usually got a detailed, up-to-date

report. Families that migrate together or form after migration are generally

stable. There is usually a father as well as a mother to provide an example to

the children and to discipline them. There are exceptions to all these

generalizations within the spectrum of immigrants, but most immigrants are

closer to the pattern the generalizations suggest than are most members of the

American black urban lower class.<p>



<p>



<p>



Many black officials and intellectuals who fear that immigration is harming the

black lower class recite the economic arguments about depressed wage rates and

competition for entry-level jobs. But when they spoke to me with greatest

passion, they were not talking about immigrants at all. Rather, they were

explaining that their deepest fears arise from the cleavage within black

society.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Some people seem to think that all blacks are poor and dispossessed," says

Marvin Dunn. "It's not true. There are two black Americas. One is doing very

well, better than ever. It is taking advantage of the system, moving up. The

other is getting larger as a group, and it is sinking deeper into the quagmire

of despair. That is the group that threatens the rest of America, black and

white."<p>



<p>



<p>



It becomes a self-perpetuating system," Dunn says. People who have grown up in

single-parent families, especially boys without fathers, are less likely to

have a sense of family responsibility when they grow up. The high volume of

children who are growing up outside a family network could ultimately cause the

destruction of the black family structure."<p>



<p>



<p>



"This is the black man's black problem," says T. Willard Fair, of the Miami

Urban League, an imposing, flamboyantly outspoken man with a shaved head. Fair

is a leading advocate of restricting immigration; he has allied himself with

Roger Conner's organization, FAIR. He argues that immigrants' gains have been

black Americans' losses, especially in Miami, where Cubans and Haitians have

made blacks politically and economically "dispensable" to whites. He has

recommended a one percent sales tax in Dade County to finance black

self-improvement. But, he says, though more money and fewer immigrants are

necessary conditions for black self-improvement, they will not be sufficient

unless the pathological culture of the black lower class is directly

confronted.<p>



<p>



<p>



"White America created that problem," Fair says, "but they are not in a

position to solve it. I am concerned that we are on the verge of losing a

generation of children. They have no ambition, no hope for a better future.

They live for the now. We have got to understand that unless we [blacks] as a

people put some basic values back in place, all the other stuff we talk

about--the high joblessness, the housing shortage--won't mean anything."<p>



<p>



<p>



Strictly speaking, the lower-class cultural problem is not directly connected

with immigration, except as the flow of willing foreign workers gives employers

even less incentive to find a place for black teenagers. But if our attitude

toward immigration ultimately turns on our notion of what makes a society

cohere, then it invites speculation about the other ingredients of cultural

cohesion. I, at least, have been left with the feeling that our major social

challenge will not be assimilating the Minhs and the Garzas, no matter how many

of them might come. Rather, it will be coming to terms with that part of

American society most estranged from the rest, giving its members a reason to

feel that they belong.<p>



<p>



THE LAW<p>



<p>



Twice in its history, the American government has undertaken a top-to-bottom

re-examination of its immigration laws. The first time, the process took more

than twenty years to complete. It began in 1907, with the appointment of the

Immigration Commission, chaired by Senator William Dillingham, of Vermont, and

continued through the late 1920s as successive "national origins" acts were

passed.<p>



<p>



<p>



The Dillingham Commission was able to write on a blank slate; when it began its

celebrations, there was virtually no immigration law to revise. But by the time

Congress approved the creation of a Select Commission on Immigration and

Refugee Policy, in 1978, the immigration code had grown until it was exceeded

in complexity and length only by the internal-revenue laws.<p>



<p>



<p>



The original chairman of the Select Commission was Reubin Askew, the former

governor of Florida. When he resigned, in 1979, to accept President Carter's

nomination as the U.S. trade representative, he was succeeded by Theodore

Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame. The fifteen other members of the Select

Commission included four Cabinet members; four senators; four congressmen; and

a state supreme court judge, a labor leader, and an official of the Los Angeles

city government who were, respectively, of Mexican, Cuban, and Japanese

descent. In all, half of the Select Commission's members could trace their

lineage to the New Immigration. They included former Secretary of State Edmund

Muskie, former Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, and former Representative

Elizabeth Holtzman. By contrast, all the members of the Dillingham Commission

were descendants of Englishmen or Scots.<p>



<p>



<p>



The Select Commission held public hearings in a dozen cities, from Albany to

Phoenix. Like the Dillingham Commission, it hired scholars and consultants for

studies of the economic, linguistic, demographic, and cultural implications of

continued immigration. In March of 1981, it released its final report and

recommendations; since then, these have focused the political deliberations

about controlling immigration.<p>



<p>



<p>



The legislative vehicle for the Select Commission's recommendations has been

the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, named for its two sponsors, Republican Senator Alan

K. Simpson, of Wyoming, who served on the Select Commission, and Democratic

Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, of Kentucky, who did not. The bill passed the

Senate last year, but a flurry of amendments kept it from coming to a vote in

the House. It died at the end of that congressional session, but was

reintroduced early this year. It has once again passed the Senate and is still

awaiting action in the House.<p>



<p>



<p>



The premise of the Select Commission's report and of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill

is that legal immigration is good for the United States but illegal immigration

is bad. Immigrants work hard, save and invest, and create more jobs than they

take," said Theodore Hesburgh, when presenting the Select Commission's findings

to a congressional committee in 1981. "The children of immigrants, according to

our studies, acculturate well to American life and actually seem to be

healthier and to do better in school on the average than those of native-born

Americans." Therefore, "it is in the national interest of the United States to

accept a reasonable number of immigrants and refugees each year. . . regardless

of the color, nationality, or religion of those admitted." But illegal

immigration creates a climate of lawlessness. Its victims, Hesburgh said,

include not only the working-class Americans whose wages are depressed but the

illegal immigrants themselves ("the ones who are victimized by unscrupulous

employers, those who die in the desert, or in the ballast tanks of ships") and

those would-be immigrants denied admission ("the ones who are waiting patiently

in line for so many years to come to the United States through the normal legal

immigration channels").<p>



<p>



<p>



Before this general principle can be applied to creating specific policies,

three questions must be answered. First, can the U.S. accept as many immigrants

as would like to come--that is, could it handle illegal immigration simply by

legalizing the entire flow? Second, if it must exclude some potential

immigrants, how can it most effectively do so? Third, how, then, should it

choose which immigrants to admit?<p>



<p>



<p>



There is almost no dissent on question number one. The population of the Third

World nations is expected to increase by 1.6 billion in the next twenty years;

more than 80 million additional people will enter the Latin American labor

force before the end of this century. Perhaps Mexico will discover a way to

feed and employ its rapidly growing population; but for the moment the flow of

Mexican emigrants is on the rise. As Central America's population soars, its

nations are disrupted by warfare and revolution.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



In the face of such pressures, the U.S. has no choice but to limit immigration.

The environmental consequences of a larger American population cannot be

conclusively proved. What can be proved is that successful absorption of

immigrants is largely a matter of proportion. The annual flow of legal

immigrants has ranged between 400,000 and 800,000 through the past decade. Even

those levels, so modest by comparison with the ones reached during the New

Immigration, have provoked widespread uneasiness and concern. The Select

Commission staff recommended that future net immigration be set at 750,000 a

year. But after the Cuban and Haitian landings of 1980, the commission decided

to recommend 500,000 a year, which was reflected in the original version of the

Simpson-Mazzoli bill.<p>



<p>



<p>



If the purpose of the bill is to open the door to legal immigration, this seems

inordinately timid. Immigrants had a shock effect in 1980 because so many of

them arrived unexpectedly in so few places. Regular, legal immigration is far

less disturbing. If illegal immigration were more effectively limited, an

increase in legal immigration might be tolerated; we would have less reason to

fear that the situation was out of control. Relative to our current population

size, total immigration of 800,000 a year would be one third the rate during

the New Immigration; one million would be less than half as much. If immigrants

add vigor to our economy and culture, can we not accommodate half as large an

alien presence as our grandfathers did?<p>



<p>



<p>



Still, as many as we choose to admit, more would desire to come. Somehow the

flow must be controlled, and there would be no shrinking from the realities

that implies. "Controlling immigration" means using the police and military

powers of the state to thwart the desires of human beings whose only fault is

having been born on the wrong side of a national border. There is no

alternative to exercising those powers, but they should be effective and

humane. Current practice is neither.<p>



<p>



<p>



The main burden is placed on the Border Patrol, supplemented by sporadic

campaigns by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to detect pockets of

illegal aliens in garment factories, restaurants, and other employment centers.

The tools at the government's disposal are hardly fearsome to most. Although it

is a crime to "enter without inspection," the punishment in most cases is

deportation. For an immigrant from Nigeria or Korea, this is a serious sanction

(and an expensive one for the U.S. government which pays the air fare back

home). For Mexicans apprehended at or near the border, it is not. For them,

deportation usually means a ride in a Border Patrol bus back to the river, and

another attempt the next day.<p>



<p>



<p>



Although illegal immigrants may be arrested if found in an American workplace,

the employer who hires them faces no penalty whatsoever. The immigration code

imposes a $2,000 fine or up to five years in jail on anyone who "conceals,

harbors, or shields from detection" an illegal alien, but thanks to a clause

known as the "Texas proviso," passed at growers' insistence in 1952, hiring an

illegal immigrant "shall not be deemed to constitute harboring."<p>



<p>



<p>



The Census Bureau estimates that 500,000 illegal aliens enter each year. That

does not mean that the alien population grows by 500,000 a year, because a

large but unknown number come temporarily as sojourners. Researchers from the

University of Texas have attempted to estimate the number of Mexicans here

illegally by seeing how many people (especially working-age males) disappeared

unaccountably from the Mexican population between one Mexican census and the

next. They determined that between 1.5 and 4.0 million Mexicans were illegally

in the U.S. in 1980, which is a smaller number than has been suggested by

"certain non-empirically based speculations on the subject."<p>



<p>



<p>



Since the illegal immigrants themselves cannot be directly counted, the

government pays attention to the things it can count--especially the number of

people the Border Patrol manages to stop on the way in. This figure has soared.

In 1965, the Border Patrol and the INS located about 110,000 "deportable

aliens," mainly through efforts at the border. (The Border Patrol attempts to

prevent illegal entry at the border; the INS supervises legal entry there and

is in charge of "area control" in cities away from the border.) By 1970, the

agencies found more than 320,000, and through the late 1970s they apprehended

roughly one million illegal aliens per year, more than 90 percent of them from

Mexico. After the peso devaluation of 1982, border stations reported another

sharp rise in the number of people apprehended. In the Border Patrol's El Paso

sector, for example, the number rose by 33 percent between August of 1981 and

August of 1982. Through the first eight months of 1983, apprehensions were well

above the 1982 levels.<p>



<p>



<p>



Such increases reflect the increased pressures driving people out of Mexico and

Central America. But the figures are also subject to bureaucratic distortions.

As Border Patrol officials are the first to point out, a woman crossing for the

day to work as a maid in El Paso looks just the same on the records as a young

man from Nicaragua nearing the end of his thousand-mile pilgrimage north. The

least significant immigrants--the thousands of day laborers who trudge across

the Rio Grande as dawn breaks each day--are the easiest to catch. In border

cities like El Paso, the Border Patrol can arrest virtually as many of these

casual crossers as it chooses. When political attention is focused on

apprehension figures, this is the way to build totals with less effort than is

required to break immigrant-smuggling operations or to "cut sign"--that is, to

track small bands of intruders through the mountains and desert.<p>



<p>



<p>



Border Patrol officials also point out that apprehension totals omit the

crucial return-migration figure. While visiting border stations in Texas and

California late last year, I was told that northward activity might be light.

The main flow would be to the south, back home for the holidays.<p>



<p>



<p>



But even when all the limits to statistical precision have been noted, Border

Patrol officials are unanimous in saying that more illegal immigrants are

attempting to come. The conventional political wisdom is that the Border Patrol

is doomed to impotence in controlling the flow. With 2,000 miles of unfortified

border to survey and a total work force of 2,600, no more than 450 of whom are

patrolling at one time, the Border Patrol is said to be hopelessly outmatched.

"There is not enough money in the federal budget to have the Border Patrol

stand arm in arm for 2,000 miles, which is what it would take," says Henry

Cisneros, of San Antonio.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



My own observations of border patrol activities left me moderately more

optimistic about the patrol's potential. Yes, the border is vast, and no, it

will never be sealed. When I asked Border Patrol and INS officials in El Paso

and San Diego whether a very patient immigrant could be absolutely certain of

penetrating, the answer was always yes. As I moved down the hierarchy, I heard

increasingly skeptical estimates of how much of the flow was being stopped. The

station chiefs and district directors said they thought that their men caught

one illegal immigrant in two or three. In the vans patrolling "the line," I

heard estimates of one in four to one in eight--and everyone was guessing. The

old hands said that new patrolmen had to get used to the idea that it was just

a job. You had to go out and serve your eight hours and do what you could. If

you thought about all the ones who got through, you would soon burn out.<p>

<p>



<p>



Nonetheless, it was also clear that the Border Patrol, however porous, made a

big difference by its mere presence, much as highway patrolmen affect the speed

of traffic even though they could never arrest everyone going over 55. Most of

the activity is concentrated in a few well-known areas. Although the E1 Paso

sector, second busiest after Chula Vista, south of San Diego, is responsible

for 341 miles of border, 86 percent of the illegal entrants it apprehends cross

in a ten-mile stretch around E1 Paso.<p>



<p>



<p>



This is not the same thing as saying that 86 percent of all crossings are made

in those ten miles, but it can hardly be surprising that immigration is

heaviest in urban areas. In the El Paso sector, where the border arbitrarily

divides one large urban population into the American city of El Paso and the

Mexican city of Juarez, a Mexican who makes it the first fifty yards in from

the border has the hardest part of his journey behind him. Once away from the

river, he can mingle in street scenes dominated by Mexican and Mexican-American

faces (300,000 of Juarez's one million residents have credentials to cross the

border legally every day). The Border Patrolmen pride themselves on being able

to pick out illegal immigrants by their dress and demeanor--everyone else will

look at a Border Patrol car as it drives by, they say, whereas an illegal

immigrant will suddenly stare at a lamp post--but the chances of blending in

are better here than in the desert.<p>



<p>



<p>



Perhaps because all sides realize that so many are getting through, there is a

routinized, almost casual air to the Border Patrol's dealings with immigrants

in El Paso. As I sat alongside the pilot in a Border Patrol helicopter, he

relentlessly tracked a limping Mexican man and two Mexican women carrying

string shopping bags, flushing them from a housing development where they

attempted to hide, pinning them in a cul-de-sac as a van roared through the

streets to apprehend them. The drama and terror of such a moment, or of the

nighttime chases on foot through back alleys, seemed lost on the patrolmen--and

on their quarry, as well. Each was doing his job; they would probably meet

again, in the same way. Five minutes after tracking down the three, the

helicopter pilot was chuckling as he buzzed a stocky Mexican man standing

knee-deep in the Rio Grande. "We call him the old capitalist," the pilot said

of the man, who had his trousers rolled up and was carrying others across the

river piggyback. "He keeps regular hours, goes on vacation with his wife. As

long as he stays in the river, we can't touch him."<p>



<p>



There are higher stakes for both sides in Chula Vista, the busiest part of the

border. Fewer of the immigrants are day-crossers. This is the northern terminus

of a long migration path up the Mexican interior; a hundred miles farther north

lie the incalculable opportunities of Los Angeles. In the Border Patrol's

favor, the "line" does not split a city here. For at least a mile north of the

border, open fields constitute a no-man's land. From a hilltop with a view of

the border, patrolmen spend nights peering through infrared scopes, looking for

the bright-green patterns that are would-be immigrants huddling in a riverbed

or crawling through the grass. The scopes, originally designed for Army tanks,

are probably more effective for the Border Patrol, since its targets can do so

little to conceal themselves or to disrupt the Patrol's activities.<p>



<p>



<p>



Almost a thousand people a day are apprehended in this sector; in the course of

several hours on the hilltop, I watched patrolmen pick out a group of crawling

or running green shapes every few minutes and then, by radio, guide patrolmen

on horseback to intercept them. Unlike E1 Paso's sojourners, many of these

people tried to escape. They seemed desperate at having been caught. It was an

ugly and sobering business; this is what the abstraction of "controlling the

border" really means. But it also suggested that the Border Patrol can be more

than a fig leaf. The crucial variable, as with the police, seems to be

presence, and more presence requires more money. The least controversial part

of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill is its recommendation that the Border Patrol be

beefed up.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



While a stronger border patrol might further restrict illegal immigration, it

will not stop it. All parties to the political debate agree that poor people

will continue to come to a rich country until life in their homeland

improves.<p>



<p>



<p>



Some claim that if international poverty is the ultimate cause of immigration,

coping with poverty is the cure. Thus Senator Gary Hart, of Colorado, has said

that immigration policy is really foreign policy. By encouraging economic

development, we can reduce the pressures that drive people to our shores.

Logically and ethically appealing as this approach may be, it is also utterly

unrealistic, at least as the centerpiece of immigration policy. Through all its

decades of providing foreign aid, the U.S. has helped other nations grow more

wheat and produce more steel, but it has been spectacularly unsuccessful in

sponsoring large job-creation projects in the Third World.<p>



<p>



<p>



As its answer to illegal immigration, the Select Commission recommended the

step that has become the most hotly contended feature of the Simpson-Mazzoli

bill: "employer sanctions," which would undo the Texas proviso--that is, make

it a crime to hire illegal immigrants.<p>



<p>



<p>



The case in favor of employer sanctions is that jobs are the magnet for illegal

immigrants, and if the jobs disappear, so will the incentive to migrate.

Technical arguments rage about the circumstances in which limited

employer-sanction programs have or have not proven effective in Europe or in

certain American states. But there is a commonsense connection between

restricting jobs and restricting illegal immigration. Illegal immigrants told

me that the one place they had to produce plausible documents in order to be

hired was southern Florida. (Elsewhere, employers asked at most for Social

Security numbers and immigrants provided fake documents, a ruse expedient for

both sides. ) Miami was also the only place where I saw illegal immigrants who

had trouble finding work.<p>



 <p>



<p>



"The chief attraction of employer sanctions for me is that it controls jobs

rather than people," the economist Michael Piore told a congressional committee

in 1981. "I think it is more humane in general....Most undocumented immigrants

come to work....If you could eliminate work opportunities, you would therefore

stop the basic attraction. People do develop attachments to this

country....Once those attachments develop, it becomes extremely cruel and, I

think, in a fundamental sense, inhuman, to expel them."<p>



<p>



<p>



Under the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, those entitled to work legally in the United

States would have to carry some sort of identification. The bill leaves the

details of the identification system vague and asks the President to report on

different options within three years.<p>



<p>



<p>



Three groups have formed an unlikely alliance to oppose this plan. Together,

they were responsible for keeping the Simpson-Mazzoli bill from coming to a

vote in the House last year. Business interests, including agricultural

growers, claim that checking credentials will be yet another intolerable

regulatory burden. Their real objection, especially in the case of the growers,

seems to be the loss of a hardworking part of the labor force. In deference to

growers' interests, the Simpson-Mazzoli bill includes a plan under which

foreign laborers can be temporarily imported, usually for farm work.<p>



<p>



<p>



Civil libertarians, including the American Civil Liberties Union, view the

national identity card as another dangerous infringement on individual rights

and privacy. "A secure verification system could very likely be built on a

national data bank which would centralize personal data about all persons

authorized to work in the United States," John Shattuck, of the ACLU, told a

congressional committee last year.<p>



<p>



<p>



To such assertions, Senator Simpson has replied that the national identity card

would be nothing more than a forge-proof record of a Social Security number,

which is already required when accepting most jobs, opening a bank account,

registering at many universities, and participating in other aspects of modern

life. How would civil liberties be harmed, he asks, by a more authentic card?

Are they not more gravely threatened by continuing to encourage the flow of

immigrants who live outside the full protection of the law?<p>



<p>



<p>



Finally, Hispanic organizations oppose employer sanctions, arguing that a

crackdown on illegal immigrants will become a crackdown on anyone who looks

Hispanic. "Well meaning employers, fearful of government sanctions, will shy

away from hiring us," says Vilma Martinez, of the Mexican American Legal

Defense and Educational Fund. "Racist or biased employers will simply use the

fear sanctions as an excuse to avoid hiring us."<p>



<p>



<p>



The supporters of the bill contend that, on the contrary, a universal identity

card will protect Hispanic Americans. Since everyone will have to present his

identity card, Flanigan as well as Rodriguez, the Hispanic will have ironclad

proof of his right to hold the job. (Under the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, the

employer would be obliged to ask for the card, and once it was presented, he

would be obliged to accept it as proof of legally admitted status.) This has

not convinced the Hispanic organizations, who represent the most formidable

opposition to the Simpson-Mazzoli bill. Their arguments so persuaded Senator

Edward Kennedy, of Massachusetts, that he became the only member of the Senate

Judiciary Committee to vote against the Simpson-Mazzoli bill. The way out of

this standoff may be through modifications of the bill, such as those proposed

by Gary Hart. He has sponsored an amendment that would impose stiff penalties

on employers who discriminate against employees on the basis of "national

origin."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



As a complement to its crackdown on illegal immigration, the Simpson-Mazzoli

bill proposes an amnesty for illegal aliens who are already here. Anyone who

could prove that he had been in the country since before a certain cutoff date

would be granted the status of having been legally admitted. Under the current

Senate version of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, anyone here before January 1, 1977,

would immediately qualify for permanent-resident status, and anyone here before

January 1, 1980, would qualify for temporary-resident status, which could be

converted to permanent-resident status if the immigrant demonstrated competence

in English within two years. The bill has not yet passed the House, and the

House version includes amendments that would push the 1977 date forward to

1982.<p>



<p>



<p>



We're never going to see again in this country what we saw in 1954 with

Operation Wetback," says Alan Eliason, the Border Patrol chief in E1 Paso,

speaking of the last large-scale attempt to round up illegal immigrants. "We

are not going to go out and try to locate and deport several million illegal

aliens. We don't have the resources. People won't stand for it. It's not going

to happen." Senator Simpson also says that amnesty is inseparable from the

basic goal of immigration reform: ending the two-class society in which some

immigrants live outside the shelter of the law.<p>



<p>



<p>



The major opposition to amnesty now comes from local governments. Once

immigrants are free to step out of the shadows, it is argued, they will demand

more public assistance. But if Orange County, California, or Dade County,

Florida, or Bexar County, Texas, ends up bearing an unfair burden for this

change in national policy, the federal government should offer reimbursement.

It is no solution at all to pretend that the U.S. will ever evict the millions

of legal immigrants who have already arrived.<p>



<p>



<p>



That leaves the final question about immigration policy: Of the many who hope

to come, how shall the U.S. choose which to accept? Admissions fall into two

categories--normal immigrants and refugees--and each presents painful

choices.<p>



<p>



<p>



In addition to changing the ethnic mix among immigrants, the reforms of 1965

placed a higher value on family reunification. Before, under the

McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, skilled workers had an advantage in qualifying for

admission. Since 1965, potential immigrants have been considered in three

tiers. First come the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, defined as spouses,

children under twenty-one, or parents of citizens over twenty-one, who are

admitted without limit.<p>



<p>



<p>



Next come less immediate relatives, who have first claim within the annual

ceilings of 20,000 immigrants per country and 270,000 from the entire world.

Places within these "numerically limited" categories are assigned according to

six preference categories, four of which are for relatives. First preference is

for unmarried adult children of U.S. citizens; second for spouses and unmarried

children of permanent-resident aliens; fourth for married children of U.S.

citizens; and fifth for brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens. Together,

these members of the extended family accounted for 190,000 of the numerically

limited admissions in 1978.<p>



<p>



<p>



Finally, there are immigrants without family ties to the United States, who, as

a whole, have far bleaker chances of admission. Some qualify for third

preference, professionals and people of "exceptional ability in the sciences or

the arts"; otherwise they are relegated to sixth preference, workers in

occupations with labor shortages, or to "non-preference," which is everyone

else. In 1978, some 14,000 occupational-preference immigrants were admitted,

along with their spouses and children, 16,000 in number. Only 54,000 people

were admitted as non-preference immigrants or through "private bills," special

legislation admitting immigrants one by one.<p>



<p>



<p>



A sane immigration policy would continue the emphasis on reuniting immediate

families. It is harder to see the justification for devoting so much of the

limited quotas to members of the extended family. Admissions systems are

inevitably arbitrary, but this is more so than most. It bestows benefits on

certain families simply because an uncle or a cousin managed to immigrate in

the past. It closes the door on the classic immigrant, the independent man or

woman who sets out to make a new life. As of 1980, Mexico had a backlog of

173,000 non-preference visa applications; worldwide, 280,000 non-preference

applications were pending. They will be considered only after the 807,000

preference-category applications are handled--which is to say, never. In

recognition of this imbalance, and in an attempt to open the door to new "seed

immigrants," the Select Commission proposed reducing the quotas for the

extended family and increasing them for independent immigrants. Why not follow

the logic to its conclusion? Keep the places for immediate family members, and

open the rest of the queue to independent immigrants.<p>



<p>



<p>



Refugees and applicants for political asylum present the most painful choices

of all. The 1965 Immigration Act reserved 6 percent, or 17,400 per year, of the

numerically limited visas for refugees. Under the Refugee Act of 1980, the

annual limit was raised to 50,000. But that law also gave the President

enormous leeway in admitting refugees, and in fiscal years 1980 and 1981

President Carter determined that more than 200,000 refugees should be accepted,

specifying a ceiling of 168,000 each year from Indochina and 33,000 from the

Soviet Union.<p>



<p>



<p>



If the major enforcement problem for the INS is stopping Mexican immigrants at

the border, its major administrative problem is handling the claims for refugee

status and political asylum filed by Haitians and Salvadorans. Almost none of

the claims have been approved; fewer than one hundred Salvadorans, for example,

have been granted asylum.<p>



<p>



<p>



One technical obstacle to the Haitian and Salvadoran claims is that the Refugee

Act of 1980 applies only to those who have already fled their homeland for some

country of first asylum other than the United States. "Vietnamese in Thailand

is eligible, but a Haitian who lands in Miami is not. He may apply for

political asylum, but he must prove, like candidates for refugee status, that

he is "unable or unwilling" to go home "because of persecution or a

well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,

membership in a particular social group, or political opinion." In principle,

this might be read to include almost anyone subject to the generalized

oppression of Third World governments. In practice, it covers almost anyone who

wants to leave the Soviet Union or its satellites, including Cuba, and precious

few others besides the Indochinese.<p>



<p>



<p>



The stories told by Haitian and Salvadoran "refugees" lack the crisp

distinctions implied by the law. A few give convincing testimony that specific

revenge awaits them if they go home. A larger number say that life there would

be worse than it is in the United States. They are, of course, correct; and

that is the ugly reality of our refugee policy. Most of the world's population

lives under some kind of repression. Even though America's upraised torch of

liberty is the noblest part of its role in the world, the U.S. cannot provide a

new home for all of the oppressed. To whom, then, should it offer shelter?<p>



<p>



<p>



The policy would seem less arbitrary if it were more narrowly focused. The

United States should accept as refugees those who have been political prisoners

or have been singled out for persecution. In addition, we have a special

responsibility in situations like Vietnam's, in which our policies have

directly affected foreigners' lives. (Some who advocate asylum for Salvadorans

say that the same reasoning should apply there, because of past and present

U.S. influence in that country.) For the rest, the U.S. should make more room

in its overall immigration quotas, offering a less arbitrary chance to the

millions around the world who hope for a better life and who could, in

unexpected ways, make our lives better too.<p>

	<i><font size=4>Most of what everyone "knows" about the demise of health-care reform is 
probably wrong--and, more important, so are the vague impressions people 
have of what was really in the Clinton plan</i></font><p>
	
	
	<pre>
	
	</pre>
	
	<font size=5>B</font>y the time the Clinton health-care-reform plan was abandoned, in 
September, everyone knew how terrible it was. It had been hatched in 
secret by an egghead team that knew a lot about policy details but had no 
grasp of political reality. The Administration had wasted time and missed 
deadline after deadline for presenting the plan to Congress, causing the 
plan to miss its best opportunity for passage-
during the President's brief honeymoon period, in 1993. The scheme was 
fatally overcomplicated. The proposed legislation, 1,342 pages long, was 
hard for congressmen to read and impossible for anyone except the plan's 
creators, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Ira C. Magaziner, to understand.<P>
The Clinton plan would have imposed sweeping changes on one seventh of the 
national economy, with consequences far greater than Congress could 
possibly consider before casting a rushed vote. It represented a 
regulation-minded, top-down, centralized approach at a time when the world 
was moving toward decentralization and flexibility--and when the supposed 
health crisis was solving itself anyway. The more people learned about 
this plan, the less they liked it, and it finally died a natural and 
well-deserved death.<P>
Or so goes the conventional wisdom, as relayed in countless newspaper and 
magazine postmortems of the health-care struggle. The critiques were 
usually accompanied by veiled jabs at Hillary Clinton--what will she do 
with her time now that health care's gone?--and outright ridicule of 
Magaziner, who was portrayed as the smartest person with the dumbest plan 
since Robert McNamara and the Vietnam War.<P>
But suppose that what everyone knows is wrong. This happens all the time 
in politics. Barely a year ago, for example, everyone in Washington knew 
that Congress was absolutely certain to pass a health-care program by now. 
The leaders of the Administration's health-care-reform effort, Hillary 
Clinton and Magaziner, believe that everyone is wrong again now. I heard 
them elaborate this view in September and October, during a series of long 
background conversations. "Background" means that I agreed to check with 
them on any material I wanted to quote directly. The gist of their views, 
however, was on the record. It is no surprise that they view the reform 
plan as something other than an overcomplicated bureaucratic nightmare. 
The surprise is how much more convincing their version of reality is than 
the prevailing one.<P>
These conversations began at Magaziner's suggestion. He and I were friends 
in graduate school, more than twenty years ago, and he was obviously 
betting that I'd listen to him more sympathetically than other reporters 
would. I am biased, in that I like and respect Magaziner. But until these 
meetings I had had no contact with him during his time as health czar, and 
I have not always agreed with his ideas. (His worst achievement: helping 
bring a no-requirements curriculum to Brown University, when he was the 
student-body president in 1969.) In this case the facts seem to be on his 
side.<P>
Let's consider each count in the conventional bill of indictment against 
the Clinton
Magaziner plan.<P>
First count: The plan was hatched in secret. During the 1992 presidential 
campaign Bill Clinton talked frequently about his interest in health-care 
reform and gave a signal about the reform approach he preferred. In a 
speech in September he recommended "competition within a budget." To the 
health-care cognoscenti this indicated an approach different from the main 
Republican and Democratic proposals of the time.<P>
The most familiar Democratic approaches were "single-payer" and 
"play-or-pay." Single-payer, which was endorsed during the 1992 Democratic 
primaries by Senator Robert Kerrey, of Nebraska, meant a Canadian-style or 
Medicare-style system. Private doctors and hospitals would provide care, 
but the government would take over all medical payments, financing them 
with a big new medical tax. All Americans would be covered. Play-or-pay, 
supported by many Democrats, required companies either to buy health 
insurance for their workers or to pay into a public fund, which would 
insure workers not covered by their companies. People who were not working 
would not be insured. An approach popular among Republicans relied on new 
tax breaks to encourage people to buy health insurance on their own. Some 
politicians from both parties endorsed a "managed competition" scheme, 
separate from all these.<P>
Clinton's reference to "competition within a budget" fit a proposal laid 
out in the fall of 1992 by Paul Starr, a Princeton professor, in a short 
book called The Logic of Health Care Reform. This book came closer than 
any other document to anticipating the ultimate shape of the 
Clinton-Magaziner bill.<P>
In Starr's plan, which was a variation on a managed-competition scheme, 
all Americans would be covered--even if they were out of work, even if 
they had "pre
existing conditions." The cost of coverage would be paid mainly by 
companies, which would contribute to the insurance premiums for each of 
their workers. The government would subsidize coverage for those who were 
unemployed or worked for small firms. Private insurance companies would 
offer coverage, as they do now, but the government would "manage" the way 
they competed for business. Each company would come up with a list of 
standard benefits, which it would have to offer at the same price to all 
customers. That is, the insurers could not turn down people who were 
already sick, or charge fifty-five-year-old applicants more than 
thirty-year-olds. Each year people could compare the offers and choose the 
plan they liked best--including a fee-for-service plan that let them go to 
their family doctor. From the customer's point of view, the system would 
work like the "open enrollment" policy at many corporations, in which 
employees can choose a new health plan each year. The government would set 
an overall limit on the amount of money that could be spent on medical 
care each year, while giving insurance companies and health plans latitude 
to spend the money as they thought best. This limit was the "budget" in 
Clinton's reference to "competition within a budget."<P>
With numerous changes of detail and emphasis, the plan that Starr 
explained in his book and that Clinton alluded to in his campaign became 
the plan the Clinton
Magaziner task force unveiled in 1993. The most important difference lay 
in what was meant by "within a budget": the bill that Clinton presented 
would have limited total spending not directly, by fiat, but indirectly, 
by limiting the amount that insurance premiums could rise each year. The 
process of working out these details and emphases kept Magaziner and some 
500 task-force members busy round the clock during the Administration's 
first few months.<P>
According to today's conventional wisdom, these meetings doomed the reform 
effort before it really began, for it was here that Magaziner and his 
fellow nerds cooked up their unrealistic schemes. But did the process seem 
weird, secretive, and isolated at the time? Yes, but in only one limited 
and revealing way.<P>
On matters of substance, the task force went out of its way to hear a 
variety of views. Most members of the task force were policy or budget 
officials borrowed from other parts of the government, but the group also 
included outside scholars and experts, plus several doctors and nurses. 
There were no representatives of organized outside interests--no delegate 
from the American Medical Association, no one from the Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers of America--but the task force met frequently with outside 
groups and above all with senators, representatives, and their staffs. By 
early May, Congressional Quarterly reported, the task force had met with 
572 separate organizations. "We had a couple of hundred meetings with the 
congressional leadership and individual members," Magaziner says now. 
"People were saying that it was the biggest outreach effort ever in laying 
the groundwork for a bill."<P>
Indeed they were saying so. A Congressional Quarterly headline on May 22 
read, "Clinton Task Force All Ears on the Subject of Overhaul." The 
article said, "Most members of Congress give the president high marks for 
laying the political groundwork necessary for his proposal to get the 
careful consideration of both parties. . . . Clinton has been playing the 
health-care issue with an eye to keeping everyone at the table, at least 
at the outset."<P>
In late September of 1993, when Hillary Clinton appeared before five 
congressional committees in three days to explain the rationale behind the 
bill, not a single legislator complained about "closed" or "secretive" 
deliberations: not Robert Dole, not Robert Packwood, not John 
Danforth--Republican senators who all later came out against the bill. 
Senator John Breaux, of Louisiana, a conservative Democrat who supported a 
competing reform plan, praised Hillary Clinton for the "truly remarkable" 
consultations the task force had carried out. <P>
So when did the task force become "secretive"? Complaints inevitably arose 
when Magaziner and his assistants stopped soliciting outside advice and 
started announcing decisions. Those who disagreed felt that they hadn't 
been listened to. "Some people say they were excluded because in this case 
we didn't agree with them," Hillary Clinton told me. "But I think that a 
fair assessment is that we listened to everybody--and then made 
recommendations based on what we thought made the most sense."<P>
The larger problem was with the one group that truly was excluded from the 
deliberations--the Washington press and, by extension, the public in whose 
interest it is supposed to act. During the brusque early weeks of the 
Clinton Administration, when George Stephanopoulos was walling reporters 
out of the White House press office and the Administration thought it 
could use talk shows to take its message directly to the public, over the 
heads of the daily press, Magaziner was told by the White House 
communications office that he and his associates should not talk to 
reporters about what ideas they were considering for the new bill. Instead 
they were supposed to refer all queries to the communications office. This 
didn't stop leaks, of course, but it gave Magaziner a lasting reputation 
among reporters as a man who liked to operate in the dark. Hillary Clinton 
is known within the Administration for a combative attitude toward the 
press. But she now says that the news blackout on emerging details of the 
health bill was a major mistake.<P>
"Even though we had a process unlike any other that has drafted a bill," 
she told me, "--more open, more inclusive--we got labeled as being 
secretive because of . . . our failure to understand that we should be 
more available to the press along the way. That was something we didn't do 
well. . . . We were not aware of how significant it is to [shape] the 
inside story in Washington, in order to make the case . . . for whatever 
your policy is."<P>
Secrecy toward reporters was stupid. But reporters are now acting as if it 
were something worse: closed-mindedness about ideas.<P>
Second count: The plan was politically naive. Everyone now knows that the 
health
care reformers drew up their master plan without taking the slightest 
interest in what most Americans thought or felt. In reality, though, the 
plan suffered because the Administration was too attentive to shifting 
political moods.<P>
Even before Inauguration Day, Magaziner was churning out memos about the 
right way to pitch the plan to editorialists and interest groups, about 
the likely Republican arguments and how to rebut them, about the 
connection between a health-care bill and a re-election campaign in 1996. 
Week in and week out his memos to Bill and Hillary Clinton contained head 
counts of likely Senate and House votes--who was leaning, who could be 
pressured and pushed. In his conversations with me Magaziner seemed to 
spend half his time sizing up the legislators he had had to deal with: 
Senator X was in thrall to Bob Dole because of personal problems, 
Congressman Y had to start out opposing the bill because of donations from 
Interest Group Z.<P>
Two fundamental decisions about the plan had much less to do with policy 
than with judgments of political reality. One involved handling the 
single-payer challenge. A Canadian-style single-payer system has two big 
virtues. It is simple to administer, since doctors, hospitals, and 
patients no longer have to worry about dozens of insurance companies with 
scores of different payment plans. The single
payer approach also guarantees that everyone in the country has medical 
coverage. But Clinton was dead set against a single-payer plan, arguing 
that it would require sweeping new taxes and would, in effect, abolish the 
entire medical-insurance industry. This left the political problem of how 
to deal with the hundred or so members of the House who supported some 
kind of single-payer plan. Without them, no health bill of Clinton's could 
possibly pass.<P>
Congress also contained a large number of supporters of market-reform and 
managed-competition plans. The main advantage of such plans is that they 
change the incentives of medical practice so that doctors, patients, and 
hospitals are more conscious of costs when making medical decisions. To 
get a plan passed, Clinton had to show that it would reform the medical 
market.<P>
"We had to try to bridge the chasm" between these groups in drawing up the 
plan, Magaziner told me. "If we were serious about universal coverage, we 
felt, then the single-payer people would buy off even if they didn't like 
managed competition. We felt we were doing enough of the market reforms 
that the reform people would buy off too. And, by the way, we also thought 
that that was the best policy."<P>
But by June of 1993 one of the main market-reform legislators, 
Representative Jim Cooper, of Tennessee, made clear that he wouldn't buy 
off. He recommended seeing to insurance reforms first and getting around 
to universal coverage in a few years. The single-payer group, of course, 
was not going to agree to that. "At that point," Magaziner said, "we knew 
that the only way we could try to bridge the chasm was to start a little 
bit left of center and try to negotiate toward the center."<P>
"Left of center" meant proposing a benefits package a little more generous 
than what the Administration really wanted, setting the employer's share 
of total costs a little bit higher, making the limits on insurance 
premiums a little bit tighter. When the Republican Party lost interest in 
negotiating, this strategy became a liability, because it made the Clinton 
plan look more extreme than it was meant to be.<P>
The other purely political calculation concerned sales strategy. 
Throughout his campaign Bill Clinton had emphasized the overall cost of 
medical care as a central evil of the U.S. system. Americans spend about 
twice as much money per capita on medical care as people in other 
developed nations, with results that are not twice as good. Whenever he 
was asked about cutting the budget deficit or taming the entitlements 
monster, Clinton said that the first and most important step was to 
control health-care costs. This approach won the support of business, 
since health
insurance costs had for years been rising faster than any other business 
expense. (From 1948 to 1990, Paul Starr points out, business spending on 
health coverage rose by an average of 15.6 percent a year.) Through most 
of 1993, while the plan was being developed and unveiled, major business 
groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of 
Manufacturers supported its general outlines and accepted even its 
"employer mandates," which would require companies to pay most of the cost 
of coverage for their employees. But by the summer of 1994 the 
Administration was selling the plan mainly as a matter of fairness and 
security. Its slogan was "Health Care That's Always There." <P>
In theory the Administration could have kept stressing both aspects of its 
plan--that it would make individuals more secure while reducing the strain 
on business. The peculiar logic of health-care economics, as revealed in 
most other developed countries and in American group-care systems, is that 
when everyone is covered, it becomes easier to control overall costs.<P>
The Administration's political experts, however, recommended a more 
streamlined sales approach. Clinton's pollster, Stanley Greenberg, 
produced results in 1993 showing that no one believed that a government 
health-care plan could ever save money. Although opinion polls taken 
through the end of 1993 showed that most people supported the idea behind 
Clinton's plan (once pollsters explained what the idea was), most people 
also believed that the plan would drive costs up, not down. Therefore the 
more the Administration emphasized its cost-control themes, the less 
believable it would become. "The polls showed that people will trust the 
government to guarantee them security," Magaziner told me. "They will not 
believe that the government can control costs."<P>
As Republican opposition to the bill increased in 1994, Democratic 
strategists decided that "security" would be a more effective, partisan 
rallying theme. "You have to mobilize people, and it's hard to mobilize 
people around words like 'cost containment' or 'universal coverage,'" 
Hillary Clinton told me. "So if we didn't convince the middle class that 
universal coverage meant them, we wouldn't get the political support. . . 
. If you talked about how they could lose their job, how they are one 
divorce or one pre-existing condition away from losing coverage, then 
perhaps they would get engaged." By the end of the struggle this sales 
approach made the Administration even more vulnerable to Republican 
charges that it was putting out a bighearted, soft-headed, typically 
liberal plan. <P>
One other enormously important, and almost purely political, decision 
sealed the fate of the bill. Magaziner and Hillary Clinton had hoped to 
present the bill to Congress a few months after the Inauguration, in the 
spring of 1993. Thanksgiving had nearly come before they were actually 
ready to present a finished bill. That delay had little or nothing to do 
with the nuances of policy. It had everything to do with political 
necessity--and of a sort that everyone knew was sensible at the time.<P>
Third count: "The First Lady's whiz-kids wasted precious months." This was 
how The Economist stated the next objection. Rather than getting busy and 
presenting the plan when the Administration still had a dewy glow, the 
health team sat around until it was too late.<P>
The Administration's original strategy was to rush the health plan through 
as part of its first budget-reconciliation bill. That would have meant 
having detailed health proposals ready by April at the latest, and the 
task force had been geared toward meeting that deadline. The genius of 
this approach, little noticed by the public, is that it would have allowed 
the health plan to pass with a simple majority vote.<P>
Congressional politics has quietly moved into the "supermajority" system 
that Lani Guinier was widely denounced for seeming to recommend. In theory 
it takes fifty
one votes to get a bill through the Senate. In reality it takes sixty 
votes to end a filibuster, so Bill Clinton knew that the Senate's 
forty-plus Republicans could stop nearly any legislation they chose.<P>
They could not stop budget bills. These come to the floor under rules that 
limit debate, and with only a fifty-one-vote majority required for 
passage. So if the health
care plan could be made part of the budget bill, the Administration could 
get it acted on quickly, with enough of its own party's votes to see it 
through.<P>
The Senate's majority leader, George Mitchell, endorsed this strategy, but 
its de facto parliamentarian, Robert Byrd, objected, scuttling the plan. 
The Administration then decided that it would introduce the health-care 
plan as soon as the budget bill passed. But passage was the rub. The 
budget bill, with its big deficit-reduction package, was seen by everyone 
in Washington as a major early test of the Administration's strength. (The 
struggle over the bill is the subject of Bob Woodward's book The 
Agenda.)<BR>
<BR>
The budget fight dragged on much longer than Bill Clinton had hoped or 
planned. As it became obvious that the final budget vote would be very 
close (on August 6 it finally passed the Senate 51-50, with Vice President 
Al Gore casting the deciding vote), the Administration wanted to avoid any 
extraneous controversy that might affect it. Clinton had been scheduled to 
make the final decisions about the health
care plan in late May. Because of fears that leaks about his choices would 
complicate the budget vote, the decisions were put off--a delay that had 
ripple effects lasting the rest of the year. Without Clinton's decisions, 
the task force could not prepare detailed legislation; without 
legislation, it could not start negotiations with congressmen and their 
staffs. Without final choices on what would be in the package, it could 
not prepare budget estimates; without those estimates, the Treasury and 
the Congressional Budget Office could not vet the plan.<P>
By the fall the budget fight was over--but then NAFTA became the issue of 
the moment. Clinton had been scheduled to spend most of the month of 
October traveling and speaking about the health-care plan. As he was 
flying to his first event, a labor convention in California, news came 
that U.S. soldiers had been killed in Somalia. Clinton flew back to 
Washington after his speech and spent most of the month dealing with 
Somalia and NAFTA; he canceled all the other health
care events.<P>
Despite the delays and missteps, when the President finally unveiled the 
plan, in September of 1993, it seemed to have a good chance. "The reviews 
are in and the box office is terrific," the political analyst William 
Schneider wrote just after it was presented. "President Clinton's health 
care reform plan is a hit. . . . The more people read and hear about the 
plan, the more they seem to like it." <P>
Six weeks after the Inauguration, Magaziner had written a memo to Bill and 
Hillary Clinton saying that if health-care-reform legislation was not 
presented and passed immediately, it probably could not be passed during 
"your first term." With Republican midterm gains in Congress, it now 
appears that this prediction will be borne out. But the delay was neither 
negligent nor intentional. It is a reminder of how quickly events spin out 
of a President's control, and how rare it is for him to be able to advance 
his own agenda rather than respond to someone else's emergency.<P>
Fourth count: The plan had delusions of grandeur. Now we move to the 
substance of the plan, which has been described as a regulatory rat's 
nest, a nightmare of overambitious social engineering, and a sweeping 
solution where modest reforms would do.<P>
The reality is that very little in this plan was new or unprecedented, and 
that it was barely more complex or comprehensive than most other plans.<P>
When people complained that the plan was grandiose, they had three 
features in mind: universal coverage (everyone would be insured, whether 
working or not), community rating (everyone in a given region would pay 
the same premium for coverage, regardless of age or pre-existing 
conditions), and employer mandates (forcing businesses to cover much of 
the insurance cost).<P>
All these ideas have been part of the health-care-reform debate for years. 
Universal coverage and community rating sound like bleeding-heart 
concepts, but they are based on tough economic reasoning. The idea behind 
both is that piecemeal reform of a health-care system can be worse than no 
reform at all.<P>
The fairness argument for universal coverage is obvious. Even people who 
are poor deserve care when they are sick or hurt. This is why every 
developed nation except the United States offers universal care. The 
economic argument has become almost as familiar. Even people without 
health insurance ultimately receive treatment, when they show up in 
emergency wards; hospitals cover the cost by padding charges for everyone 
else. This backhanded form of coverage is neither economically efficient 
nor humane. As recently as the fall of 1993 Bob Dole was saying that 
universal coverage was a "non-negotiable goal of reform."<P>
Community rating is a closely related idea. Every health-care-reform 
scheme in America is concerned with holding down costs. In most businesses 
market competition does the job, but competition in the health-insurance 
area often works in a perverse way. Insurance companies have tended to 
compete not by improving the incentives, habits, and nature of medical 
treatment--which in the long run is the only way to limit expenses--but by 
becoming choosier about whom they will insure. If they can limit their 
coverage to young, healthy people and rule out those who are already sick, 
then they can offer coverage at a lower price, without having done 
anything to improve the efficiency of care.<P>
This is what has happened to the health-insurance business in the past 
generation. In the old days Blue Cross offered coverage to everyone in the 
same geographic area at the same price. Now younger, healthier people can 
get cheaper coverage--which many of them skip anyway, figuring they don't 
need it--while prices rise for those most likely to need care. Fewer of 
them can afford to buy it, more must take advantage of the cruel and 
inefficient fallback of emergency-room coverage, and overall costs keep 
going up. The young, healthy people eventually become old and sick, and 
are caught too. <P>
This cycle is known as adverse selection, and it has been talked about in 
the health
care-reform business for years. Community rating is the main response. It 
is designed to average each person's medical costs over the course of his 
or her whole life and to make sure that people have coverage at the times 
of their lives when it's most necessary. In proposing community rating the 
Clinton team was hardly making waves.<P>
Even the part of the plan that sounded strangest and most radical, its 
"mandatory alliances," is already familiar to millions of Americans under 
a different name. Anyone who works for a big company or a state or federal 
agency knows about the open-enrollment system for selecting health 
insurance. The company or agency negotiates with HMOs, insurance 
companies, and local medical networks that want to offer coverage to its 
employees. Once a year employees choose which plan they want. The employer 
then deducts money from their paychecks, adds its own share, and passes 
the money on to the medical providers.<P>
This, with small variations, is also how the task force's mandatory 
alliances would have worked. They would have taken bids from insurance 
companies, HMOs, and other health providers and then let each household 
choose the plan it liked best. Each provider would have been required to 
set a price for a standard benefits plan, so that customers could make 
easy price comparisons among the offerings. The alliances would not, as 
has often been assumed, have tried to provide medical care themselves, 
through big new government clinics.<P>
The most ominous-sounding aspect of the new alliance system was its 
"mandatory" nature. Everyone would have been obliged to choose and buy a 
standard benefits plan from an alliance. (Contrary to repeated claims by 
opponents of the bill, people would have been free to buy any extra 
coverage they wanted, or get any additional treatment from any doctor they 
chose, as long as they did it with their own money. Employers would also 
have been free to offer additional coverage.) The health-care task force 
argued that the alliances had to be mandatory in order to create the 
community-rating effect. Otherwise, young, healthy people would stay out 
of the system, and the pernicious cycle of adverse selection would begin. 
An exception was made for employees of very large companies, who would 
still have been able to buy through their own firms' open-enrollment 
plans. The reasoning was that a General Motors or an AT&T had a work force 
large and diverse enough to constitute a community-rating pool all by 
itself. Everyone would have been forced into a pool one way or another.<P>
Some health-care-reform plans have no mandatory component. Several 
versions of managed competition, for instance, would set up alliances like 
those in the Clinton bill but not require anyone to buy from them. It is 
virtually impossible, though, to achieve universal coverage without some 
element of compulsion. (Medicare offers universal coverage for those over 
sixty-five, but everyone who works is compelled to pay a Medicare tax.) 
Moreover, Magaziner argued, for most people the mandatory system would in 
practice mean more choice and freedom than they now enjoy.<P>
When he ran a small business in Rhode Island, Magaziner said, he covered 
all health-insurance costs for his employees but could give them only two 
plans to choose from. Handling the bidding and paperwork for a broad range 
of plans would have been impossible. "If there had been an alliance, I 
could have paid my dues to the alliance and let people choose among all 
the plans." The alliances in the Clinton bill would have been required to 
offer customers a choice among all plans that met basic certification 
requirements. In big cities a dozen or more plans might be available. The 
minimum offering would be three kinds of coverage, including at least one 
fee-for-service plan that would permit a family to stay with the 
independent doctor it had been using.<P>
After the plan was withdrawn, Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton 
University, told The New York Times, "No one understood this, but the 
average American patient would have had more choice under the Clinton plan 
than they now will. If you work for a particular company, your choice of 
HMOs is whatever that company offers you." Some critics argued that the 
Clinton plan would destroy the market for coverage beyond the plan's basic 
benefits, and that as a result people would find it difficult to buy as 
much coverage as they might like. But that is different from the 
widespread belief that extra coverage would be against the law-
and for most people the range of choice would probably be broader under 
Clinton's plan.<P>
Far from concocting a system that would look and feel radically different 
from what Americans were accustomed to, the task force believed that it 
was changing the surface of health care as little as possible while 
altering its underlying economic structure. The alliance system, despite 
its strange name, was meant to look familiar to people who already had 
coverage. The employer-mandate system of finance, in which companies would 
bear most of the health-insurance costs, reflected the fact that 90 
percent of the people who now have insurance (excluding those on Medicare) 
get it through their employer. The employer mandate is a de facto tax but 
a well-established one, and a familiar concept in health-policy circles. 
Many Republicans, including Robert Packwood and Richard Nixon(!), have 
over the years endorsed employer-mandate plans.<P>
Indeed, none of the individual elements of the Clinton plan was a shocking 
new entrant into the health-care debate. The plan's system for controlling 
expenditures, through premium caps that limited how fast the cost of basic 
coverage could rise, departed from Paul Starr's recommendations. But it 
closely resembled a plan offered by a group of congressional moderates 
that included the Republican senators John Danforth and Nancy Kassebaum.<P>
To say that the resulting package of proposals was "too complex" is like 
saying that an airplane's blueprint is too complicated. The Medicare 
system is complex. So is every competing health-care-reform plan. Most of 
the 1,342 pages of Clinton's Health Security Act (which I have read) are 
either pure legal boilerplate or amendments to existing law. Conventional 
wisdom now holds that the sheer bulk of the bill guaranteed its failure. 
The Nafta bill was just as long, and so was the crime bill that passed 
last summer. If the health bill had been shorter and had not passed, 
everyone would know that any proposal so sketchy and incomplete never had 
a chance.<P>
Fifth count: It was a coercive approach to one seventh of the economy--and 
to a problem that was solving itself.<P>
Much of the problem for the plan seemed, at least in Washington, to come 
not even from mandatory alliances but from an article by Elizabeth 
McCaughey, then of the Manhattan Institute, published in The New Republic 
last February. The article's working premise was that McCaughey, with no 
ax to grind and no preconceptions about health care, sat down for a 
careful reading of the whole Clinton bill. Appalled at the hidden 
provisions she found, she felt it her duty to warn people about what the 
bill might mean. The title of her article was "No Exit," and the message 
was that Bill and Hillary Clinton had proposed a system that would lock 
people in to government-run care. "The law will prevent you from going 
outside the system to buy basic health coverage you think is better," 
McCaughey wrote in the first paragraph. "The doctor can be paid only by 
the plan, not by you."<P>
George Will immediately picked up this warning, writing in Newsweek that 
"it would be illegal for doctors to accept money directly from patients, 
and there would be 15-year jail terms for people driven to bribery for 
care they feel they need but the government does not deem 'necessary.'" 
The "doctors in jail" concept soon turned up on talk shows and was echoed 
for the rest of the year.<P>
These claims, McCaughey's and Will's, were simply false. McCaughey's pose 
of impartiality was undermined by her campaign as the Republican nominee 
for lieutenant governor of New York soon after her article was published. 
I was less impressed with her scholarly precision after I compared her 
article with the text of the Clinton bill. Her shocked claim that coverage 
would be available only for "necessary" and "appropriate" treatment 
suggested that she had not looked at any of today's insurance policies. In 
claiming that the bill would make it impossible to go outside the health 
plan or pay doctors on one's own, she had apparently skipped past 
practically the first provision of the bill (Sec. 1003), which said,<P>
"Nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting the following: (1) 
An individual from purchasing any health care services."<P>
It didn't matter. The White House issued a point-by-point rebuttal, which 
The New Republic did not run. Instead it published a long piece by 
McCaughey attacking the White House statement. The idea of health 
policemen stuck.<P>
So did the idea that one seventh of the national economy would be 
transformed overnight. Of the vast American commerce in health care, more 
than 40 percent is already paid for by the federal government, mainly 
through Medicare. Under the Clinton plan the rest of the money would still 
go through most of the insurance companies, HMOs, doctors, hospitals, and 
laboratories that are receiving it now.<P>
The final element in the conventional wisdom is that this cumbersome, 
flawed plan was in any case unnecessary, because the health-care problem 
was going away. Medical costs rose by "only" 5.9 percent in 1993--yet that 
was more than twice as fast as wage growth and almost twice as fast as the 
overall inflation rate. Over the past several decades medical costs have 
risen about three percent faster than the overall inflation rate; in 1993 
the gap was 2.9 percent. <P>
"There is no persuasive evidence that we are in either a stabilized or an 
improving health-care-financing environment," Hillary Clinton told me. "In 
fact, many of the problems will only continue to get worse. The problems 
that middle-class Americans care the most about--like what doctor they can 
see--will likely become appreciably worse, because many will be forced 
into managed care over which they have no say. Employers will make those 
decisions. They will pay more for fewer benefits. How deeply this sinks in 
and how much it motivates political action, I don't know."<P>
If this plan did not perish because it had been designed in intolerable 
secrecy, or because its designers knew nothing about politics, or because 
it was full of unacceptable new ideas, or because it was so much more 
complex than any predecessors, then what happened to it?<P>
The Administration's view, for which, again, there is ample evidence, is 
that it went down because of two zero-sum games, one political and one 
economic. Health
care reform became a battle in which some would win and others would 
lose--and Clinton lost.<P>
Through most of 1993 the Republicans believed that a health-reform bill 
was inevitable, and they wanted to be on the winning side. Bob Dole said 
he was eager to work with the Administration and appeared at events side 
by side with Hillary Clinton to endorse universal coverage. Twenty-three 
Republicans said that universal coverage was a given in a new bill.<P>
In 1994 the Republicans became convinced that the President and his bill 
could be defeated. Their strategist, William Kristol, wrote a memo 
recommending a vote against any Administration health plan, "sight 
unseen." Three committees in the House and two in the Senate began 
considering the bill in earnest early in the year. Republicans on several 
committees had indicated that they would collaborate with Democrats on a 
bill; as the year wore on, Republicans dropped their support, one by one, 
for any health bill at all. Robert Packwood, who had supported employer 
mandates for twenty years, discovered that he opposed them in 1994. "[He] 
has assumed a prominent role in the campaign against a Democratic 
alternative that looks almost exactly like his own earlier policy 
prescriptions," the National Journal wrote. Early last summer conservative 
Democrats and moderate Republicans tried to put together a "mainstream 
coalition" supporting a plan without universal coverage, without employer 
mandates, and without other features that Republicans had opposed. In 
August, George Mitchell, the Democratic Party's Senate majority leader, 
announced a plan that was almost pure symbolism--no employer mandates, 
very little content except a long-term goal of universal coverage. Led by 
Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich, Republicans by September were opposing any 
plan. "Every time we moved toward them, they would move away," Hillary 
Clinton says.<P>
"We always knew that in the end people's trust of the President and First 
Lady would be crucial," Ira Magaziner says. "The debate was going to be 
complicated, and that trust factor was very important." Whitewater eroded 
the trust factor. The President looked beatable, and he lost.<P>
Economic factors counted too. Doctors had fought bitterly against Medicare 
in the early 1960s, but for the most part they sat this battle out. If 
they weren't controlled by the government, they would be controlled by 
insurance companies, which in some ways were worse. But other interest 
groups had more to lose. Health-insurance agents would be put out of 
business. Health-insurance companies could have their premiums capped. 
For-profit hospitals thought they would lose money. Manufacturers of 
medical equipment thought that market growth might slow. Large businesses 
that did not already offer health care for workers knew the employer 
mandate would cost them money. (These were mainly corporations like 
PepsiCo and General Mills, which own restaurant chains whose part-time 
workers are uninsured.)<P>
During the 1992 campaign the Clinton war room excelled at answering 
negative charges immediately, before damaging impressions could set in. 
But even flatly untrue attacks on the health plan went 
unanswered--direct-mail campaigns saying that everyone would have to go to 
a government clinic, daily doses of misinformation from Rush Limbaugh, TV 
advertisements fanning McCaughey
style fears of jail terms for people who wanted to stick with their family 
doctor. Last March The Wall Street Journal found that a panel of citizens 
preferred the provisions of the Clinton plan to the main 
alternatives--when each plan was described by its contents alone. But when 
pollsters explained that the preferred group of provisions was in fact 
"the Clinton plan," most members of the panel changed their minds and 
opposed it. They knew, after all, that Clinton's plan could never work.

	<font size=5>A</font>lmost every American family sooner or later must pay for medical care for 
an ailing parent or grandparent. This is so because people 65 years of age 
and over are sick more often, have more chronic illness, such as cancer or 
heart disease, and are less able to pay for medical care than are younger 
adults. Indeed, the staggering cost of hospitalization and medical 
treatment is the commonest cause of pauperization of the elderly.<P>
Congress has recognized the seriousness of the problem, and to meet it two 
different kinds of bills have been considered. One type extends the 
Old-Age and Survivors' Insurance coverage of the Social Security Act so 
that medical benefits can be paid automatically to the aged sick from 
insurance premiums collected during the working life of the insured. 
(Obviously, special provision would have to be made to meet the temporary 
problem of medical care assistance to those not under Social Security and 
those already retired who did not accumulate medical care benefits during 
their working lives because the law did not then include these benefits.) 
Such a law would also prevent illness from bankrupting our older citizens. 
The other type of bill extends the welfare provisions of the Social 
Security Act so that medical benefits can be paid from federal and state 
appropriations to the aged sick if they can prove that they are unable to 
pay.<P>
The law which was passed by Congress last September (Social Security 
Amendments of 1960, Title VI) falls into this second category. It provides 
for payment of certain medical bills, on evidence of need, through 
individual state plans financed from federal and state appropriations 
calculated according to a matching formula. The need is determined by a 
means test. A social worker, or, more likely, a clerk trained as a social 
investigator, questions the applicant, checks on his assets, and makes 
recommendations to be approved by the responsible local welfare officer. 
Exact benefits to any individual will depend on his state of residence. 
There will be many different plans, since each of the fifty states must 
submit its own plan based on appropriate enabling legislation. So far only 
four states and Puerto Rico have submitted plans for federal approval.<P>
Where state legislation has already been passed, the aged, in order to be 
eligible for financial aid, must have exhausted most of their assets and 
must have a financial status barely above the welfare level. There are, 
however, enough loopholes to permit the aged sick, if they have the 
necessary political influence, to protect their assets and still obtain 
financial aid for payment of their medical bills. As a result, our 
self-supporting old people may now find themselves at the mercy of the 
local political boss when they become sick.<P>
Although the exact details of operation of the present law vary from state 
to state, certain generalizations can be made. The first and immediate 
result of the law is to assist the states in paying for those aged already 
on relief rolls. The state may either substitute federal funds for 
existing state expenditures or expand its medical care program for the 
aged sick on the welfare rolls, or it may do both. In neither case does 
this bring aid to patients who are not already on or eligible for 
relief.<P>
Insofar as the self-supporting aged are concerned, the intent of the 
present law is "to furnish medical assistance on behalf of aged 
individuals...whose income and resources are INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE COST 
OF NECESSARY MEDICAL SERVICES." But it is impossible to estimate the cost 
of the necessary medical services in advance in order to conserve assets, 
because the physician cannot predict the patient's future. Elderly 
patients whose heart attacks, cancer, and strokes bring them to the 
hospital during acute flare-ups can recover in a short time, suffer 
temporary or permanent disabilities of varying degrees of severity, 
develop one of many possible complications, or die any time in the course 
of the disease. In contrast, for welfare patients who have no assets to 
conserve the lack of predictability is unimportant, since medical costs 
can be estimated from time to time on a short-term basis and funds can be 
provided as needed.<P>
Except for the restriction "no lien may be imposed against the property of 
any individual prior to his death on account of his medical assistance for 
the aged," the responsibility for determining financial eligibility is 
placed on the states. Each state may establish the definition of assets to 
be taken into consideration in the means test, the financial limit above 
which no assistance will be granted. The state also decides whether other 
kinds of assets will be excluded from consideration.<P>
For example, in Massachusetts, before financial assistance can be given, 
all assets other than real property and life insurance have to be expended 
down to a sum of $2000 to $3000, depending on the sex of the patient and 
whether or not the spouse is alive. All children of the patient are liable 
for repayment in full of the financial assistance granted. It is assumed 
that in enforcing this latter provision, all children will have to submit 
to a means test.<P>
This new federal law will degrade the self-supporting aged because it does 
not prevent financial bankruptcy. Instead, after remaining assets are 
expended almost down to the present welfare level, the applicant must 
submit himself to the usual series of welfare investigations and 
procedures. It will come as a shock to those who consider themselves to be 
self-reliant Americans to find that, through no fault of their own, as a 
result of illness, they will be treated by society as if they were on 
relief. Let us see how the law would work in a typical case.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two weeks ago, Mrs. Caroline Jones, 68 years old, suddenly had a stroke. 
She was taken to the hospital unconscious, but has improved so that she is 
now almost completely alert. Her entire left side is paralyzed, although 
she is regaining control and strength in her fingers. The doctor thinks 
that if she has no immediate complications, she may leave the hospital in 
about one or two weeks, provided a bed becomes available in a good nursing 
home or someone can be found to care for her at home. The doctor has 
warned the family that the outcome is uncertain. She may make a complete 
recovery. But there are many possible complications, and even without them 
she may have any degree of permanent disability, including complete 
invalidism.<P>
Mrs. Jones has been living in her own home and caring for her 72-year-old 
husband. He has been short of breath since a coronary attack five years 
ago. Until his retirement at 65, he was a skilled machinist and "made good 
money." He had always been a proud man, never wished to be dependent on 
others, and had accumulated considerable savings and a few thousand 
dollars' worth of government bonds, owned his own home outright, and had a 
life insurance program. Following his retirement, he supported himself 
with odd jobs, but he has been unable to work since his heart attack.<P>
The cost of his long illness and his lack of income, except for Social 
Security payments of $125 per month, have left him with total assets of 
about $5000, plus the equity in his $12,000 home, on which he recently had 
to take a mortgage of $7500. His hospital and medical care insurance, 
which was a fringe benefit of his employment in a large electrical 
company, was canceled on his retirement.<P>
The Joneses have two children. The daughter is married to a schoolteacher, 
George Allen. They live nearby in a small house, with five children--three 
in high school and two in a local college. The Joneses' son moved to the 
West Coast, where he works in an airplane factory. He sends his father a 
small check every month "to help out." Two of his three children have 
recently married and are beginning families of their own. The third, a 
daughter, had severe paralytic polio as a child and needs constant 
attention. He has been very frugal, because he wants to make sure that his 
daughter will always have the necessary medical care.<P>
Mrs. Jones's son-in-law, George Allen, begins to worry. He has estimated 
that the hospital and medical bills to date are from $500 to $700. After 
Mrs. Jones leaves the hospital, her medical care will cost from $75 to 
$l25 per week for an indefinite period. The expense of this new illness 
added to Mr. Jones's care could quickly bankrupt the family. Mr. Allen has 
heard of the new law to provide funds for medical care for people over the 
age of 65. But when he calls up the local welfare department, he finds 
that no money can be provided before a means test is performed. This will 
involve an analysis of the financial status of the patient and her family, 
and will take time. The guess is that this case can be reached in three to 
four weeks.<P>
Meantime, Mr. Allen is sent an instruction sheet outlining the conditions 
under which financial aid can be granted. Among other things, he finds 
that about half of the Joneses' remaining assets will have to be expended 
before aid can be requested and that all payments made for medical care 
may be recovered from his wife and her brother at a later date.<P>
George Allen becomes frightened and wonders whether he can conserve some 
of the family's assets. He calls his lawyer, who arranges an appointment 
for him with the councilman from his district. The councilman is very 
friendly but makes no specific recommendations. He explains the law with 
particular emphasis on excluded categories of assets. The councilman then 
suggests, "When you are ready to make an application, send it along to me 
and I will see that you get a decision without delay."<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mrs. Jones's case is typical. The financial problems would have been the 
same if she had had a heart attack, cancer, or any other common serious 
disease of the aged. The delays and uncertainties in obtaining benefits 
under the present law may also interfere with medical care and may defeat 
attempts at preventive medicine. When disease needs early treatment and 
comes on gradually, another serious effect results. In order to avoid 
impending bankruptcy, patients may postpone calling the doctor in the hope 
that the disease will cure itself.<P>
However this complicated law may affect the individual, several facts are 
clear: a large staff of interviewers will be necessary; the cost of 
administration will be high; and local political patronage will be 
widespread. Because of the many undefinable medical and economic 
variables, the regulations implementing the law cannot be specific. The 
responsible officials in state and local government will, therefore, have 
much latitude for determining eligibility in individual cases.<P>
The situation is thus tailor-made for political favors when old people 
want to hang on to what little they have left and when the cost of a 
particular case cannot be predicted and administration becomes complex and 
prolonged. The local political boss will be in a key position if, while 
medical bills are piling up for one of his constituents, he can 
short-circuit the slow-moving, cumbersome machinery of multiple means 
tests by having the forms filled out and by arranging for a quick, 
foolproof decision.<P>
Further leeway is permitted by the federal prohibition of liens on 
property and by state exclusion of other types of assets. Foresighted old 
people may have their lawyers arrange their estates not only to avoid 
taxes but also to maintain their eligibility for medical care funds. 
Assets may be transferred from such categories as stocks, government 
bonds, and saving accounts to pay off the mortgage on the home or to add 
to other excluded categories of assets.<P>
Once illness has begun, legal advice will no longer be helpful, since no 
lawyer can ethically advise transfer of assets in order to defraud the 
government. So, if assets are to be transferred at the first sign of 
illness, local political influence may be helpful in protecting the 
patients against a too-searching means test. Also, children with assets 
likely to be attached will use whatever political influence they can 
muster to protect their own personal interests.<P>
A most serious defect of the new law is the creation of an ethical climate 
similar to that of the Prohibition era. Self-respecting aged citizens 
facing bankruptcy due to illness will be open to any influence which might 
protect them from destitution. Otherwise upstanding citizens will not 
hesitate to defraud the government or to give their votes in return for 
political influence to help pay for their medical bills. This practice 
would not be new in our society. In the early part of this century it was 
not unusual for the needy to give their votes in exchange for the 
necessities of life. These practices fostered the power of the local 
political boss, particularly in urban areas.<P>
The decline of the power of the political boss in the United States was 
hastened by the passage and implementation of the Social Security Act. 
Favors in the form of handouts to be exchanged for votes could no longer 
compete with benefits which the citizen had earned and received as a 
matter of right under law. This was Edwin O'Connor's conclusion in his 
analysis of the decline of the political boss in The Last Hurrah. This 
opinion was supported most dramatically by James Michael Curley, former 
Massachusetts political boss, in a television broadcast at the time of the 
publication of his book I'd Do It Again.<P>
Local political bosses and ward heelers would welcome a pork barrel 
comparable to the one they controlled before the passage of the Social 
Security Act in 1935. The present law is exactly what they have been 
looking for. Large sums of money are involved. Congress has estimated that 
the additional cost of the present program in all of the states for those 
people not already on relief will amount to $325 million in state and 
federal funds each year, but it is already clear that the cost will be 
many times this sum and that no exact estimate can be made now. In 
exchange for votes, local political bosses may be able to help their 
constituents become eligible for medical care payments. In addition, they 
will control patronage through the many jobs required for the 
administration of the new law. This is particularly so where state law 
provides for appointment by local government and where merit systems are 
loosely enforced.<P>
This new law will inevitably lead to indirect political control over the 
patient's ability to pay his physicians' fees. It is, therefore, 
surprising that the American Medical Association has publicly announced 
its support of the present law, in spite of its frequently expressed fear 
of political control of medical practice. Self-interest alone ought to 
make the association overcome its blind opposition and favor putting 
medical care benefits for the elderly into the insurance provisions of the 
Social Security Act, under which patients would have their claims paid as 
if from an insurance company. It is incredible that the American Medical 
Association fails to see that a law based on the insurance principle would 
be free from the political domination over individual physicians, which is 
a major feature of the present law.<P>
Dissatisfaction with the present federal law has caused some states to 
postpone the enactment of enabling legislation. Others consider it an 
interim solution, in part because they wish to take immediate advantage of 
available additional federal funds for the aged sick already on relief. 
For example, Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York, in his annual 
message to the legislature at the opening of the 1961 session, said, "To 
take advantage of federal funds made available by 1960 legislation, I 
propose adoption of a new $40 million program of additional medical 
assistance for the needy aged in New York state.....It is my conviction, 
as I have previously stated, that far more comprehensive federal 
legislation is required to help our senior citizens meet their medical 
needs. I believe that the only fiscally sound approach to the financing of 
such a federal program is through the proven contributory system of Social 
Security."<P>
The new federal law was a major political issue during the presidential 
campaign. Vice President Richard Nixon indicated his satisfaction with the 
law as passed by the special session of the Congress. This was somewhat 
surprising, because the Eisenhower Administration has favored the concept 
that the individual, insofar as possible, be responsible for his own 
support. The present law actually encourages certain patients to become 
destitute or to refuse jobs if remaining assets or additional income would 
make them ineligible for major benefits. On the other hand, Senator John 
F. Kennedy was dissatisfied with the law and promised that, if elected, he 
would press for the enactment of a law based on the insurance principle of 
the Social Security Act. Indeed, such a law has been given early priority 
in his legislative proposals to the 87th Congress.<P>
Congress has clearly recognized that voluntary health insurance cannot 
meet the need, and financial assistance by the government for payment of 
medical bills for some of the aged is now a reality. But the present law 
also does not meet the need, and furthermore fosters direct local 
political control over the aged sick. Passage of a law under the Social 
Security Act would protect the aged against bankruptcy due to illness. It 
would also, in one fell swoop, do away with political control, debasing 
means tests, and complex, expensive administration, and would be 
self-supporting. Let us hope that Congress acts 
promptly.

<h2>Signet Banking Corporation Facts, History and Highlights</h2><p><font size=+1>	Signet Banking Corporation is a $11 billion financial services organization that offers a wide array of financial products through its Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking and Capital Markets divisions. The corporation is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SBK."<p>	Signet traces its roots back to 1795 as the Bank of Baltimore in Maryland, making it the 8th oldest bank in the U.S.  The predecessor of the parent company was founded in 1922 as the Morris Plan Bank of Richmond and was one of the first banks to offer installment loan credit to average individuals.
<p><A HREF="1970s.mov"><IMG align=right SRC="images/1970pic3.gif" ALT="1970s Movie File"></A>
Signet (then Bank of Virginia) was the first bank in the country to sign up with a new way to pay for purchases in 1953 -- MasterCharge, now MasterCard International.  Signet has been a leader in technology in the banking industry and was one of the first banks to bring the ATM to Virginia and Maryland.  Signet is also one of a handful of banks in the nation to process checks using image technology.  And Signet was the first U.S. bank to establish a comprehensive site for <A HREF="http://www.signet.com/collegemoney">college financing information</a> on the World Wide Web.
<p> 
	Headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, Signet has a <a href="http://www.signet.com/perfinance/branch.htm">branch</a> and <a href="http://www.signet.com/perfinance/atmlocator.htm">ATM</a> network throughout Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia, and customers nationwide. The company is expanding its offices and market presence across the nation, with a mutual fund marketing group in Vermont and New York, mortgage offices in North Carolina and Tennessee and other extension offices in Georgia, Texas, California, and Pennsylvania. The recent national roll-out of consumer loan products has brought customers to Signet from every state. 
<p>
<A HREF="distirel.mov"><IMG align=left SRC="images/distpic3.gif" ALT="Distance Irrelevant Movie"></A>Signet uses a strategy known as <a href="http://jerome.signet.com/hr/ibdm.html">Information-Based Decision Making (IBDM)</a> to target financial products to people most likely to purchase them.  Products and services are customized and refined for groups based on a series of results from statistical models using credit bureau and other available data.<p>IBDM made possible the rapid growth and ultimate spin-off of most of Signet's credit card business, now known as Capital One Financial Corp.  IBDM is at use throughout Signet, from commercial products and services to deposit and credit products for consumers.<p><p>

<FONT SIZE=+1>As the numbers of available options increase, the task of selecting the savings tools that match your needs has become more challenging.  Even though there are many savings vehicles available, they fall into several broad categories:  savings accounts, time deposits (generally known as certificates of deposit or CDs), and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).  To learn more about these categories, select one of the sections below.  Should you come across terms that are unfamiliar, use the glossary for assistance.<P>

Signet is currently developing and evaluating security measures to protect its customers' accounts.  Those measures include:
<UL>
<LI>RSA Encryption (SSL for example), which protects information transferred between customers and Signet.
<UL>
<LI>Netscape <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/newsref/ref/internet-security.html">Internet Security</A>
</UL>

<LI>Firewall Technology, protecting unauthorized access to Signet's information systems.

<LI>User Name and Password requirements for accessing specific account information.
</UL>
While this is not a complete list, these are some of the security options Signet is actively pursuing in order to insure that each customer's account information and activity is kept confidential.

 As businesses become more streamlined and more competitive, they hire the
most qualified employees, the ones who can deliver the most &quot;bang for the
buck&quot;. And they keep those employees by investing in employee benefit programs
which reflect the business' need for efficiency and effectiveness. How can
you compete with the big guys? You don't need to be a huge, multi-national
conglomerate to be able to offer a competitive benefits package to your
employees. You won't have to spend a lot to maintain your investment plan
when you choose Signet Bank's affiliate, Signet Financial Services, Inc. So you'll still have some
money left over to invest in your own retirement. And isn't that why you
work so hard in the first place? </P>

for retirement 
<LI>No limit to employer contribution 
<LI>Enables pre-tax salary deferral and employer matching 
<LI>Employee deferral is limited to any reasonable amount up to 100% of salary
and/or bonuses

 The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued a mandate which specifies
that all business taxpayers who paid at least $50,000 in employment taxes
during 1995 must begin paying taxes electronically starting on July 1, 1997.
The Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS) will accept both debit
and credit Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments as part of this mandate.
Both of the Signet services listed below are designed to handle ACH credit

<h1>Signet Banking Corporation Reports Earnings</h1>
<p>
<font size=+1>
RICHMOND, Va. - (Jan 22, 1997) - Signet Banking Corporation today reported earnings of $33.6 million, or $.55 per share, for the fourth quarter of 1996 and $124.9 million, or $2.06 per share, for the year.  In 1995, Signet reported earnings of $9.0 million, or $.15 per share, for the fourth quarter and $111.1 million, or $1.86 per share, for the full year.  
<P>
<P>Reported results for 1995 included charges for a commercial fraud loss and earnings of Capital One Financial Corporation prior to its spin-off to shareholders on February 28, 1995.  Adjusting for these items, net income for the 1996 fourth quarter and the full year rose 6 percent over the comparable periods in 1995.  On the same basis, earnings per share increased 4 percent in 1996 above 1995 fourth quarter and full-year levels.
<P>
<P>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Malcolm S. McDonald said that the company was pleased with the vibrant revenue and asset growth and credit quality.  "We accomplished a great deal during the year through innovative marketing and risk management techniques. Targeted commercial and consumer businesses were very well-received in the marketplace.  Loan-by-check outstandings, despite a six-month hiatus in marketing, grew 80 percent.  We are encouraged by promising early results for gathering deposits by mail, and are experiencing good response to several other commercial and consumer products and services.  We capped the year by completing our first student loan securitization in December." 
<P>
<P>The managed loan portfolio (loans and securitized assets) grew $949 million to $7.4 billion at December 31, 1996.  Robust loan growth in both the commercial and consumer sectors spurred 15 percent annual growth in the portfolio, even as Signet continued to reduce its commercial real estate lending exposure.  Focused regional and national middle market specialties and lease financing accounted for most of the growth in commercial loans which rose $360 million, or 12 percent, in 1996.  Direct-response installment lending fueled the 20 percent increase in managed consumer loans, which reached $3.4 billion at year-end.
<P>
<P>Non-performing assets decreased 29 percent during the year to $38.8 million, or .61 percent of balance sheet loans and foreclosed properties, compared with $54.3 million, or 1 percent, at the end of 1995.  Net charge-offs in 1996 were $66.8 million, or 1.13 percent of average loans, and $53.1 million, or .87 percent, in 1995.  Excluding the loan-by-check risk tests, the net charge-off ratio was .74 percent in 1996.
<P>
<P>Signet provided $29.8 million in the fourth quarter, and $73.9 million for the full year of 1996, to the allowance for loan losses.  At December 31, 1996, the loan loss allowance of $136.7 million equaled 352 percent of non-performing assets and 2.15 percent of loans outstanding.
<P>
<P>Total revenues (net interest income and non-interest income) for the quarter were $206.3 million and $748.3 million for the year.  Total revenues were 12 percent higher than the 1995 fourth quarter, and up 13 percent year-over-year, excluding Capital One.  Non-interest income benefited from strong trading gains and securitizations.  Signets net interest margin was 4.56 percent, down from 4.70 percent in the previous quarter.  Funding costs remained fairly stable in 1996 while asset yields adjusted to lower base rates, accounting for most of the decrease in the net interest margin.
<P>
<P>Non-interest expense for the fourth quarter and the full year was $125.3 million and $485.3 million, respectively.  Adjusting for Capital One and the fraud loss in 1995, non-interest expense grew 8 percent as a result of higher staff and marketing expenses in 1996.  In October, Signet initiated a company-wide redesign program to realign its infrastructure and improve efficiency.  Implementation of the redesign will begin in mid 1997.  The efficiency ratio was 65 percent for 1996. 
<P>
<P>The 1996 return on equity was 14.4 percent and the return on average assets was 1.1 percent. The equity-to-asset ratio was 7.9 percent.
<P>
<P>Signet is a $12 billion financial institution with headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. The company offers a wide array of financial services through its Capital Markets, Commercial and Consumer Banking businesses. Signet has offices in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia, and markets several of its products nationally.

<p>
<font size=+1>Since opening our doors in 1922 as the Morris Plan Bank 
of Richmond, Signet has been focused on meeting consumers' needs. 
Our goals have been accomplished in many ways:  by developing new 
products, by expanding the ways we deliver services, by identifying 
new community partners, and by improving communication with both 
individuals and community groups in our market areas.  As 
Signet moves toward becoming a financial services company for the 
next century, our commitment remains unchanged.
<p>
Signet's community reinvestment program strives to understand the 
diverse needs of our communities and to respond in a timely, 
effective manner.  We accomplish this mission 
through one-on-one discussions with community leaders and 
neighborhood groups; ongoing and consistent outreach; continual analysis 
of lending and service efforts; market surveys; active 
participation in community planning; and feedback from customers, 
employees and our <a href="bod.htm">Board of Directors.</a>
<p>
Another important element of community reinvestment is the active 
involvement of our senior management, Board, and specialized 
staff.  Viable and responsive community reinvestment activity demands 
access and participation at all levels of our company.  
The Board determines the community reinvestment policies that govern 
Signet's community initiatives.  Senior managers and business-unit 
leaders manages these policies, and community reinvestment 
professionals coordinate our corporate and regional programs.
<p>
Finally, we believe our community reinvestment efforts should link 
strong and viable community groups, government agencies, and 
for-profit entities into driving forces that will promote 
progress and revitalization.  We are committed to using all 
our resources -- lending, investments, contributions, and 
people -- in the redevelopment of Signet communities.
<p>
Whether providing lending expertise to a developer, uniting community 
groups toward a common goal, linking fellow banks in a joint 
project, sponsoring a forum to educate the public about 
housing or small business issues, supporting the operation of 
a nonprofit organization, or counseling individuals so they can 
earn a better credit rating, Signet extends its best resources 
to create the right answers for the challenges facing our 
communities.
<p>
The following pages provide an overview of our community reinvestment 
efforts and a snapshot of several 1995 activities involving Signet 
and our community partners.  We welcome your comments about 
these or other Signet community reinvestment initiatives.

B</font size><a href="ba2.html">usiness analysts</a> at Signet do not define themselves by their position on an organizational chart or the size of their office.  Our analysts distinguish themselves by the way they think, the  way they approach problems and the way they work together.  They blend strategic vision, persistent curiosity and a strong will to succeed.
<p>
<font size=+4>
A</font size>t Signet, we don't expect our analysts to conform to one image, with a particular major or career objective.  Instead, we seek prospects who demonstrate skill sets which we believe we can build upon and which will serve both employee and employer well in the future.  Our analysts are encouraged to articulate and work towards their personal goals.

<h2><a name="Heading1">Frequently Asked Questions about Security</a></h2>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="Heading2">Is it safe?</a></h3>
<p>Yes. While it is understandable that you be concerned about the safety of
your financial data, remember that almost everything that you can do with
Signet Online<sup>sm</sup> Web Banking you can also do over the phone, and probably would without
concern. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Add to this our encryption and authentication, and you have a special security
procedure that isn't available over the telephone, the fax, or even by mail.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="Heading3">Do I need special software?</a></h3>
<p>No. All you need is a browser that supports the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
level 2. These include Netscape Navigator 3.x, Netscape Navigator 2.02,
and Microsoft's Internet Explorer version 3.x. Other advanced browsers may
work also; feel free to experiment. If a browser doesn't support the necessary
security features, you will merely receive an error message from the server.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="Heading5">What can I do to improve security?</a></h3>
<p>Open Netscape's Security Preferences, then click the &quot;General&quot; tab. Make
sure all the &quot;Show an Alert before...&quot; boxes are checked. Be certain the
box marked &quot;Enable SSL v3&quot; is checked, then click the Configure button next
to it. If your browser supports 128 bit encryption, make sure it is checked.
If all you see is 40-bit options, get the registered, domestic version of
the browser from your Internet service provider, Netscape, or your local
software store. This version, available only to US residents, supports the
much more secure 128-bit encryption. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that any settings you change will affect all secure sessions, not just
your connections to Signet Online<sup>sm</sup> Web Banking.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="Heading6">I'm not worried about security. How can I improve performance?</a></h3>
<p>You can improve performance at the expense of security in Netscape's Security
Preferences. </p>
<p>Open Security Preferences, then click the &quot;General&quot; tab. Make sure all the
&quot;Show an Alert before...&quot; boxes are unchecked. Be certain the box marked
&quot;Enable SSL v3&quot; is checked, then click the Configure button next to it.
Set the encryption options to 40-bit encryption.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that any settings you change will affect all secure sessions, not just
your connections to Signet Online<sup>sm</sup> Web Banking.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="Heading7">What's all this about 40-bits and 128-bits?</a></h3>
<p>A properly designed encryption algorithm is only breakable by attacking
it with &quot;brute-force&quot; methods. In other words, the fastest way to break
the cipher is to try every possible key. The number of bits in such an algorithm
represents the number of possible keys, and thus the difficulty of breaking
it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A 40-bit key has 2<sup>40</sup>, or about a trillion, possible combinations. A fast mainframe computer
capable of 64 million instructions per second could work on nothing else
for a year and still have only a 50-50 chance of breaking a 40-bit key.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A 128-bit key has 2<sup>128</sup>, or about two hundred trillion <b>times</b> more possible combinations than 40-bit. This is rather more secure, as
the same mainframe would have to spend two hundred trillion years before
it had its 50% chance of success! </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Heading8">A More Detailed Discussion of Security and Encryption</a></h2>
<p>It happens to everyone. As soon as you got on the Internet, some friend
or co-worker came up and asked, &quot;Aren't you afraid? I've heard it's not <b>safe</b>.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The media, TV in particular, have made a big deal about the risks of the
Internet. The colorful world of hackers and crackers, even the terms: Virus,
Trojan Horse, Public-Key Encryption, all have a ring of espionage that makes
for good, sensational TV. The reality is a more prosaic, but no less important.
Let's discuss how Internet Security relates to you and, specifically, the
Signet Online<sup>sm</sup> service. </p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="Heading9">What's at risk?</a></h3>
<p>To begin with, let's touch briefly on the real risks: At no time are you,
or anyone else using the Signet Online<sup>sm</sup> service connected directly to the Signet Bank computers where your money
is &quot;kept.&quot; If the worst possible thing happened, and your computer was stolen
with your User ID and Password taped to the monitor, the absolute most any
bad guy could do would be to look at your balances, read your mail, and
move money between <b>your</b> accounts. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So, understand that your money is <b>safe</b>. What is at risk here is your privacy. This is your bank mail, your account,
and no-one is supposed to see it but you. All the extensive protection we
have implemented is there to protect your privacy. </p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="Heading10">What's beyond our control?</a></h3>
<p>Of course, if you actually leave your User ID and Password taped to your
monitor, there's nothing we can do. You probably know someone who writes
their PIN number on their ATM card and this is just as foolish. Don't do
it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There's one other thing we can't control, and in this sense the TV is right:
We can't keep someone from seeing anything you send over the Internet. The
structure of the Net itself makes it impossible. It's a public net, and
someone with the appropriate hardware can get a look at just about any chunk
of traffic -- similar to the way anyone can <b>look</b> at your car as you drive it on a public street. What we can do is make
it impossible for them to do anything <b>with</b> it. This is why most Internet security focuses on encryption -- the wired
equivalent of locking your car. As you'll see, though, we have some tricks
you could never use with a car.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="Heading11">What we do to protect you</a></h3>
<p>We're about to get technical here, but bear with us. We have many security
features involved for your protection, but each protects against a different
threat. Our first level of defense is your User ID and Password. We use
these to assure that you are the person on the other end of the line. From
there, things get more complex. Our server is designed to implement the
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, a very advanced form of security which
involves authentication, encryption, and verification. Let's take a look
at a session:</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you first access the Signet Web site, you are communicating normally.
Anything you send over the net, and anything our server sends back, are
&quot;in the clear;&quot; anyone intercepting your communications would be able to
see everything you type, and every page we send. Once you enter the secure
area, however, (by pressing the &quot;Continue&quot; button on the Welcome page) everything
changes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First, your browser and our server go through a special procedure called
a handshake. </p>
<p>To begin, the server sends you our security certificate. This allows your
browser to satisfy itself that you are actually connected to our server.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then they each generate two keys: Your browser creates a key for sending
that can only be deciphered by our server, and another key for deciphering
messages sent from our server. Our server also uses one key to send to and
one to receive from your browser. The keys are encrypted and securely exchanged.</p>
<p><!-- <p>
(Note that even our server can't read messages encrypted to be sent to you.
Neither can your browser understand its own messages encrypted for our server.
This is possible through public-key encryption, which provides one-way locks
for data. You can freely give your public key to your friends (or even your
enemies), because it can only be used to encrypt messages to you, never to
decrypt them. Knowing someone's public key provides no clue to help decipher
their messages.)<p> --></p>
<p>Next, they negotiate the security algorithms they will use for encrypting
messages (usually either a 40-bit or a more secure 128-bit algorithm). Your
browser tells our server which algorithms it supports, and our server chooses
the strongest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now that the line is secured, the server prompts you for your User ID and
Password. When you have entered these correctly, you pass on into the Web
Banking section itself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At this point, communication between your browser and our server continues
&quot;normally,&quot; with the additional step that every message continues to be
encrypted with the session's keys. Each set of keys is used only for a single
session; even if the hypothetical mainframe spent its year (or trillion)
cracking today's session, it would have to start from scratch to break tomorrow's.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, to guard against someone sitting down and using your computer when
you leave the room, we have a time-out feature. If you request no new data
from the server in three to 15 minutes (you can set the time in the Options
section), our server disconnects you automatically. If you wish to log in
again, you and your browser will have to go to the Welcome page and go through
the above steps all over again. Though typing your User ID and Password
in again is a bother, your browser certainly has the lion's share of the
work. Of course the hypothetical bad guy has the truly insurmountable task,
which is, after all, the point!</p>
<p></p>

<BR><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#800000"><B>What it Does:</B></FONT></CENTER>

<STRONG>A Controlled Disbursement Account (CDA) is designed to give you exact, same-day clearing information on disbursed checks presented for payment.  Signet obtains the total amount of your daily clearings from the  Federal Reserve and provides this information to you allowing your company to receive a more accurate cash position.  Non-productive balances are eliminated and your ability to make investment or borrowing decisions on exact funding needs is enhanced. </STRONG><P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#800000"><B>Benefits of Controlled Disbursement:</B></FONT></CENTER>

<UL><STRONG><LI>Provides notification of check clearing totals by 10:00 a.m. each day via PC or touch-tone telephone.

<BR><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#800000"><B>What it Does:</B></FONT></CENTER>

<STRONG>A Payable Through Draft Account uses payment instruments that have the appearance of a check but are drawn directly on your company.  The Payable Through Draft gives your company two advantages.  First, you have the convenience of using a check-like instrument.  Second, you are better able to control frequent payments to field representatives while maintaining full control over your disbursements.</STRONG><P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#800000"><B>Benefits of a Payable Through Draft Account:</B></FONT></CENTER>

<UL><STRONG><LI>Allows field agents (such as insurance claim adjusters) to issue on-the-spot payments to your company's customers or vendors.
<LI> Gives your company full control over disbursements by enabling the review of draft payments before final payment.
</STRONG></UL>

<BR><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#800000"><B>What it Does:</B></FONT></CENTER>

<STRONG>Positive Pay helps your company track which checks have cleared your account and then manages the payment of these items. Checks may be automatically returned, or you can choose to send back only those items believed to be altered or fraudulent.  This service is most suited for high volume check customers that have centralized control of the check issuance function.  Check copies are not provided but if inspection is necessary, your company may want to consider the use of Signets Payable Through Draft service.</STRONG><P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#800000"><B>Benefits of Positive Pay:</B></FONT></CENTER>

<UL><STRONG><LI>Allows for enhanced control of company funds by providing daily information on individual checks that meet certain criteria.
<LI>Reduces the risk of losses as a result of fraud, forged and/or altered checks.  Checks presented but not recorded on company books will quickly alert management to potential risk.

<STRONG>Payments are processed at high speed using  either Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) technology on state-of-the art, high speed processing equipment.  As each batch of remittances and checks/money orders are image-captured using Signet's technology, a unique batch and sequence trace number is assigned.  These same trace numbers follow the documents through the scanning process and are applied to both the document and the check/money order.  Use of consistent trace numbers facilitates simple information retrieval, research, and internal audit requirements.  When coupled with Signets Rapid Image product, which allows access to not only the remittance data but also to the  actual document images, tasks such as research and customer service become even more efficient.</STRONG><P>

<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>"W</FONT>hen I first negotiated with Signet Bank for construction loans, I met with senior officials and expressed my feelings that many construction lenders were 'fair weather friends.'  I wanted to know Signet's attitude toward this situation.  They were quick to assure me through good times and bad they would stand by my company to establish a long term 'partnership'.  Their commitment was put to the test during the early 90's when our company went through a major stockholder buy-out and  a slow market at the same time.  They proved to be very supportive and never backed away from any commitment.  I knew for certain that I had found a lender who I could count on for years to come.  We are fortunate to have multiple lines of credit with several lenders.  However, because of the superior service and trusting relationship, the bulk of our loans are placed with Signet.  Our company has always had a wonderful relationship with the Signet personnel as they are eager to simplify our administrative 'headaches' by quickly and efficiently processing all of our requests." <BR><BR>

<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=center SIZE=5>

<BR><BR><P><B>Congratulations to Tom Teal, Signet Residential Construction Finances Builder of the Month.  Tom Teal has been building homes in the Richmond area for over 25 years.  Teal is the largest home builder in Richmond and is consistently ranked among the 400 largest home builders in the United States. Teal attained its size and reputation by focusing on customer service.  The company offers over 50 standard home plans for customers to choose from.  Each plan can be customized to suit the individual needs and tastes of the buyer through the use of the Teal Homes architectural staff and computer-assisted design. 

	<P>Teal homes are in over 18 communities in the Richmond area, including AshCreek and Kings Charter in Hanover County, Foxcroft and Rivers Bend in Chesterfield, and Birkdale.  More recently, Teal Homes completed construction of 85 retirement homes in the Methodist Retirement Community of Cedarfield in Richmonds West End.  Teal was selected to build this project because of its reputation for design expertise and quality construction.  

	<P>Signet Residential Construction Finance congratulates Tom Teal and wishes him much success with all of his future home building projects.    </B><BR>

<P>
<p><b>Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM, also called Variable Rate Mortgage):</b>
A mortgage with an interest rate that adjusts periodically to reflect changes
in market conditions. Your mortgage payments are adjusted up or down (usually
on an annual basis) as the interest rate changes. To protect you in a rising
interest market, rate increases are limited (usually 2 percentage points
annually; 6 percentage points over the life of the loan).<P>

<p> <b>Annual Membership/Participation Fee:</b> An amount that is charged
annually for having a line of credit available. It is charged regardless
of whether or not you use the line.<P>

<p> <b>Annual Percentage Rate (APR):</b> The cost of credit on a yearly
basis expressed as a percentage. (In the case of a mortgage, this rate also
includes points and other associated costs, therefore it is usually higher
than the advertised simple interest rate. The APR more accurately reflects
what you'll be paying and allows you to compare different mortgages based
on actual costs.)<P>

<p> <b>Application Fee:</b> Fees that are paid upon application for your
loan or credit line. It may include charges for property appraisal and
a credit report.<P>

<p> <b>Appraisal:</b> An estimate of the value of a home, made by a professional
appraiser. The maximum amount of the mortgage is usually based on the appraisal.<P>

<p> <b>Balloon Payment:</b> A lump-sum payment that you may be required
to make under a plan when the plan ends.
<P>

<STRONG>Blended Interest:</STRONG>  Using this method of calculating account interest, you earn a base rate on balances up to a fixed amount, a higher rate on balances above the first level ceiling up to a second fixed amount, and the highest rate on the remaining balance.<P>

<p> <b>Cap:</b> A limit on how much the variable-interest rate can increase
during the life of the plan.<P>

<p> <b>Prepaids:</b> The amounts that are put into escrow at closing,
usually including real estate taxes, insurance, and interest from the settlement date to the end of the month.<P>

<p> <b>Principal:</b> The amount of money that you owe. This will

<FONT SIZE=+1><p>Installment loans are a great way to fund that project or make that
purchase you've been looking forward to for so long but were never quite
sure where the money would come from. Whether it is building an addition
to your house, putting in a swimming pool, or buying a boat or new car,
an installment loan can be the best way to make it all happen.</p>

<p> With an installment loan, you can borrow the amount you need and make
monthly payments on that amount over a period of time until it is paid
off. Typically you are required to pay it off by a certain date but have
the option to pay it off at any time prior to your scheduled repayment
date, thus decreasing the total amount of interest you must pay on the
loan. (Prepayment penalties may apply to certain types of loans.  Read all loan terms carefully before borrowing.)</p>

<p>So, if you've been putting off that home improvement project, an installment
loan may be the place to start.</p></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Credit cards are becoming more and more important in today's society.
You can use your credit card at almost any merchant to purchase just about anything
imaginable. The best thing about a credit card is convenience. You don't
need to carry cash with you, and when you're in a jam it can come to the
rescue. For the added convenience and overwhelming acceptance of credit
cards, an annual fee is generally charged for credit cards.  Where extended credit is granted (that is, for purchases not paid off each month), an annual percentage rate (APR) is charged.

<p> Most credit cards allow a grace period on purchases until the billing
date. This means that interest will not be charged on those purchases that
were made during the statement period. If you choose not to pay off your
balance, interest will accrue, typically beginning on the payment due date, although this may vary. This is
typically different for cash advances, however. Cash advances can be made
at any bank or financial institution (including ATMs) that accept credit
cards (e.g. Master Card&reg; or Visa&reg;). You may receive any amount of cash up
to your cash advance limit and interest begins to accrue on the date the
cash is received. Often times credit card companies will offer special
low APRs on cash advances and balance transfers for a limited time. Many
times your credit limit and APR will be different for purchases and cash
advances. 

<p> A credit card is a very convenient tool and can be used for just about
anything, but a word of caution: keep track of your credit card spending to ensure
that your credit card bill doesn't exceed your ability to make timely repayments. </p>

<p>Another form of credit that is similar to an installment loan is a line
of credit. A line of credit is similar to an installment loan in that you
borrow a set amount of money (e.g. $5000), however the difference is, if
you pay off a portion of that money (e.g. $1000) you can borrow again up
to your original limit (i.e. you can borrow that $1000 again), as long as you are complying with the terms of the loan. A line of credit is typically extended for a set period of time and during that time you can have as much outstanding as
your limit will allow, and in this respect it is much like a credit card.</FONT> </p>

<FONT SIZE=+1>More and more lenders are offering home equity lines of credit and
loans. By using the equity in your home, you may qualify for a sizable
amount of credit, available for use when and how you please, at an interest
rate that is relatively low compared to most credit cards and installment
loans. Furthermore, depending on your specific situation - you may be allowed to deduct the interest because the debt is secured
by your home. (Always consult a qualified tax advisor to determine your specific situation.)</p>

<p>If you are in the market for credit and you are a home owner, a home
equity plan may be right for you. Home equity lines and loans are priced
lower than many consumer loan instruments due to the added security provided
by having your home as collateral. When making this decision, you should
weigh carefully the costs of a home equity plan against the benefits. Shop
for the credit terms that best meet your borrowing needs without posing
undue financial risk. And, remember, failure to repay the loan could mean
the loss of your home.</p>

<p> If you would like more information on what a <a HREF="#LOC">Home Equity
Line</a> or <a HREF="#second mortgage loan">Second Mortgage Loan</a> is,
read on for an overview. This may be the solution you've been looking for.
And remember, if you would like an explanation of any of the terms being
used, click on the <a  NAME="glossary"><a HREF="lendglos.htm">glossary</a>

<h4><a  NAME="LOC">What is a home equity line of credit?</a></h4>

<p>
<br>A home equity line is a form of revolving credit in which your home
serves as collateral. In most cases the financial institution which originates
the loan will place a lien on your home in case the loan is not repaid.
Because the home is likely to be a consumer's largest assset, many homeowners
use their credit lines for major items such as education, home improvements,
or medical bills but not for day-to-day expenses.</p>

<p> With a home equity line, you will be approved for a specific amount
of credit -- your credit limit -- this is the maximum amount you can borrow
at any one time while you have the plan.</p>

<p> Most lenders set the credit limit on a home equity line by taking a
percentage (usually between 75% and 90%) of the appraised value of the
home and subtracting the balance owed on any existing mortgage. This is
called your Loan to Value Ratio or LTV. </p>

<p>In determining your actual credit line, the lender also will consider
your ability to repay, by looking at your income, debts and other financial
obligations, as well as your credit history and that of any co-borrower. </p>

<p>Home equity lines often set a fixed time (often 10 years) during which
you can draw down money, much like a line of credit. When this period is up,
the plan may allow you to renew the credit line. But in a plan that does
not allow renewals, you will not be able to borrow additional money once
the time has expired. Some plans may call for payment in full of any outstanding
balance, while others may permit you to repay over a fixed time, called
the repayment period.</p>

<p> Once approved for the home equity line, usually you will be able to
borrow up to your credit limit whenever you want. Typically, you will be
able to draw on your line by using special checks. Under some plans, borrowers
can use a credit card or other means to borrow money and make purchases
using the line. However, there may be limitations on how you use the line.
For example, some plans may require you to borrow a minimum amount each
time you draw on the line or keep a minimum amount outstanding. Some lenders
also may require that you take an initial advance when you first set up
the line.</p>

<p> Due to the high costs of opening a home equity line, some banks may
charge closing fees that typically range from $99 to $500. These fees generally
include the costs of recording the lien with the county/city registrar and appraisal of the property that will serve as collateral. In many cases the financial institution which extends the

<h3><a  NAME="second mortgage loan">What is a second mortgage loan?</a></h3>

<br><FONT SIZE=+1>A home equity loan, or a second mortgage loan, provides you with a
fixed amount of money repayable over a fixed period. Usually the payment
schedule calls for equal payments that will pay off the entire loan within
that time. You might consider a traditional second mortgage loan instead
of a home equity line if, for example, you need a set amount of money for
a specific purpose, such as an addition to your home.</p>

<p> In deciding which type of loan best suits your needs, consider the
costs under the two alternatives. Look at the APR and other charges. You
cannot, however, simply compare the APR for a traditional mortgage loan
with the APR for a home equity line because the APRs are figured differently.
The APR for a traditional mortgage takes into account the interest rate
charged plus points and other finance charges. The APR for a home equity
line is based on the periodic interest rate alone. It does not include
points or other charges.</p>

<p> Due to the high costs of opening a Second Mortgage Loan (Home Equity
Loan) some banks may charge closing fees that typically range from $99
to $500. These fees generally include the costs of recording the lien with
the county/city registrar and an appraisal of the property securing the loan. In many cases the financial
institution which extends the loan will allow you to roll the closing fees
into your loan amount.</p></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Many long-time renters and first-time home buyers don't think they
can afford a home, believing that a monthly mortgage payment is always
larger than a rent payment. Others think that you have to have a lot of
money in savings for a down payment and closing costs. And some presume
that anything negative in their credit history will disqualify them from
obtaining a mortgage. Low to moderate income families also may believe
that they cannot afford a mortgage. However, there are many opportunities
that exist through government subsidized programs. Contact your loan officer
for more details. These misconceptions keep many eligible buyers on the sideline.

<p> Read the information below for basic explanations of the different
types of mortgages available. If you would like an explanation of
any of the terms being used click on the <a HREF="glossary.htm">glossary</a> link at any time to view the definitions of commonly used jargon.</p>

<CENTER><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" ></CENTER><P>

<h3>Three Mortgages-Many Options</h3>

<br>Although there are many options for a first mortgage loan, they
all fall into one of these three general categories: 
<ol>
<li><b>Fixed Rate Mortgages:</b> Monthly payments for interest and
principal stay the same for the life of the loan. Property taxes and
homeowners insurance may increase and cause an increase in the monthly loan payment, but generally the monthly payments
will be very stable.</li>

<p> Fixed rate mortgages are available for a variety of term lengths. The
shorter the term, the higher the payment. There are also &quot;bi-weekly&quot;
mortgages, which shorten the term of the loan - saving you literally tens
of thousands of dollars in interest - by calling for payment of half the
monthly payment every two weeks. (Since there are 52 weeks in a year, you
make 26 payments, which is the equivalent of making 13 monthly payments
every year.)
<p><a HREF="glossary.htm">glossary</a>
<br></p>

<li><b>Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs):</b> These loans generally begin
with an interest rate that is 2-3 percent below a comparable fixed rate
mortage, and could allow you to buy a more expensive home. For some, the
lower starting interest rate - and resulting lower monthly payments -
make home ownership possible.</li>

<p> With an ARM, the interest rate is subject to change at specified intervals
(for example, every year) depending on changing market conditions; if interest
rates go up, your monthly payment will go up, too. However, if rates go
down, your mortgage payment will drop also.</p>

<p> To protect you over a long period, ARMs have an interest rate maximum or "cap".
You'll know, upfront, the highest interest rate you would ever have to
pay on your ARM.</p>

<p> There are also mortgages that combine aspects of fixed and adjustable rate
mortgages - starting at a low fixed rate for 3, 5, 7, or 10 years, for
example, then adjusting to market conditions on an annual basis for the remaining
term.
<p><a HREF="glossary.htm">glossary</a></p>

<li><b>Balloon Mortgages:</b> These mortgages offer low, fixed-rate payments
as though the mortgage were a 30-year term. But instead, the loan has a
fairly short term such as 5 to 7 years* - and then ends with a single
large payment (the &quot;balloon&quot;) for all the remaining principal.
Most people arrange for refinancing as that time approaches. The balloon
mortgage can be a good choice if you know you'll only be in your home for
a short time.</FONT>
</li>
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1><EM>*For example, with a $100,000 mortgage loan amount with
a 10% down payment, a fixed interest rate of 7.750% and an APR of 7.750%,
your monthly payments would be $664.77 for the first 7 years, then on the
seventh anniversary of your loan closing the balance of $89,524 would be
due.</EM></FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Organization Of Guide</STRONG></FONT><BR> The
sequence of topics at this site parallels the steps you should take in your
quest to finance  college. First, you must define your monetary need and second,
you must learn how to finance that  need. Please don't skip to the scholarship
resource sections and begin firing off appeals for help. </P>
<P>For most people, equating the financial aid process with an isolated search
for scholarships is an  unproductive way to spend time, and the time of the kind
organizations offering assistance. Instead,  start at the beginning.<BR>
</P>
<P>First you will explore the larger trends in higher education finance, as
well as learn to separate fact  from fiction.<BR>
</P>
<P>Then you will learn the special vocabulary of financial aid. You will meet
the players in the financial  aid game, and you will learn how to calculate your
family contribution-the amount of money your  family will be judged capable of
contributing to college costs. We will guide you through the entire  aid
application process and show you how to take charge of each step along the way.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Why is taking charge important?</STRONG><BR> 1.	It increases your
eligibility for aid.<BR> 2.	It enhances your chances of receiving all the aid
to which you are entitled.<BR> 3.	It improves the composition of your
award-more grants and fewer loans.<BR>
</P>
<P>Third, you move from fundamentals to more advanced topics. You become a
master of the financial  aid game-college selection, personal finance and tax
strategies. You learn the best moves for two  different situations: when college
entrance is approaching fast and when college is still years away.<BR>
</P>
<P>Fourth, you will meet the major money sources-the colleges, Uncle Sam, and
the states. They are  the dispensers of billions of dollars. By getting to know
their programs well, you will not overlook a  single penny that is due you.<BR>
</P>
<P>Fifth, you learn about two major alternatives for financing college
costs-your boss, and the US  military. The suggestions may not be to your
liking, but you should know about them and consider  or reject them at this
point in the process.<BR>
</P>
<P>And finally, you get to special opportunities. You've already had the meat
and potatoes course.  Now you are looking for the cake or maybe just the
frosting. You'll find sections here for the bright,  the career-oriented, the
athlete, the graduate student, and for minorities and women. <BR>
<I>Don't Miss Out</I> concludes with tips to bring together many of the ideas
developed earlier at greater  length. Use these tips as a review. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>It Takes Special Knowledge</STRONG></FONT><BR> A
college education is expensive. For some families it can be the largest
expenditure they will ever  make-more costly than the purchase of a new home and
with fewer years to make the payments.  Even though this may not be what you
want to hear, don't throw up your hands and walk away.  Financial help is
available-plenty of it. But there is more to getting aid than matching a list of
 scholarship leads to a pile of stationary. It takes special knowledge. For
instance:<BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Knowing Who Gets the Aid</STRONG>. In theory, student aid should go
to those who need it most. In  practice, assistance is more likely to find its
way to those who know how, when and where to  apply. <BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Knowing About The Buyer's Market</STRONG>. Competition for
students, especially top students, is  intense. This competition creates
opportunities-opportunities you can maximize.<BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Knowing Basic Personal Finance Techniques</STRONG>. There are
investments, gifts, low-interest loans,  education bonds, and special lines of
credit. When properly used, these techniques can help your  cash flow and
reinforce the availability of student aid. When improperly used, they will
cancel your  eligibility for aid. You want to achieve the former and prevent the
latter.<BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Knowing How to Tell Good Advice From Bad Advice</STRONG>. Advice on
paying for college is plentiful.  But not all of it is good. Some is dated. Some
is wrong. And some is tainted by the self-interest of  those who offer it.</P>
<P>Special knowledge is what this guide is all about. <I>Don't Miss Out</I>
will teach you and your family  how to formulate your own financial aid
strategy-one that will lead you to a good, affordable higher  education.<BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>The Big Picture</STRONG></FONT><BR> The good news
is that in 1997/98 nearly $60 billion in student aid will be available. Another
bit of  good news is that even more money is out there to be had. Uncle Sam's
biggest student aid effort,  the Stafford Loan, is an entitlement program. That
means everyone who is eligible for a loan can get  a loan. But it takes an
application. As the great Confucius would have said: &quot;Apply forget-no loan 
you get.&quot; <BR>
</P>
<P>The good news is balanced, as always, with bad news. In 1997/98, student
expenses (tuition,  room, board, books, fees, and transportation) will total
$129.68 billion and while these expenses  continue to take large annual jumps,
student aid (except for loan money) will level off or even  decline.<BR>
</P>
<P>While looking for student aid, keep in mind that Uncle Sam, Colleges,
States, and Employer-Paid  plans are the main sources of student aid. Not
private scholarships. Our advice: When you look for  financial aid, head for the
tables with the biggest plates. Unfortunately, many student aid seekers  don't
follow this advice. They make the search for crumbs-that 2% of the Student Aid
pie which  represents private scholarships-their number one priority. NOT SMART!<BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Looking to the Future<BR>
</STRONG></FONT>Our next point. Paying for college isn't a one-shot deal. You
must think in terms of this year's costs,  next year's costs, and the following
year's costs. A lot will happen during the next few years. You  should be
conscious of these trends and make them part of your long-range plan. What
follows are  the most important ones. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Trend A: College Costs Increase Faster Than Inflation</STRONG><BR>
Beginning this fall, and continuing over the next 10 years, the number of people
going to college will  increase from 14.4 million to 16.4 million. This surge
means schools should be able to spread their  fixed costs-plant, maintenance,
staff and faculty salaries-among more paying customers. Combine  this with
concerted efforts by colleges to cut costs, and the result should be smaller
annual tuition  increases; we predict a rate just slightly ahead of inflation.
Why not a rate equal to inflation? There  are many reasons why rising college
tuition can't be likened to increases in the cost of bread. For  example:<BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Higher education is labor intensive</STRONG>. For this reason,
technological gain does not have as great  an impact on &quot;productivity&quot;
in the academic world as it does in the industrial world. College students 
cannot be turned out like Model Ts. Great teaching, as Socrates and Plato knew,
comes from  conversation between two inquiring minds. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Computermania and Technology</STRONG>. In their never-ending pursuit of
excellence, college after  college is grabbing headlines by announcing that
every student will be equipped with a personal  computer. These computers must
be linked by networks and supported by mainframes. They need  wiring, cooling,
maintenance, and a training staff. All this costs money. Also, if colleges are
to be on  the leading edge of technology, they must have the latest in
laboratories, research equipment, and  machinery. Most of them don't have it
now. Getting it (and maintaining it) will cost billions. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Fuel Costs and Deferred Maintenance</STRONG>. These are,
proportionally, a far greater burden on  colleges than on families. Old
buildings, drafty halls, and a student population that overloads the  circuits
with gadgets ranging from hair dryers to multimedia computers keep the meters
spinning.  Also, colleges are plagued with leaky roofs, crumbly foundations,
cracking asphalt and inaccessible  pipes. Ivy won't hold up the walls forever.
Our campuses need over $60 billion in repairs.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>The Robin Hood syndrome</STRONG>. Financial aid budgets, with few
exceptions, can no longer meet the  financial need of all students. For years
the common solution was to raise tuition through the roof;  those who could pay,
in effect, subsidized those who could not. In fact, at some of our nation's 
pricier, most elite schools, an average of 20% of each student's tuition goes
for scholarships for  students with need. Slowly, however, as families come to
realize how few students actually pay  &quot;sticker price,&quot; it's putting
pressure on colleges to rethink their pricing strategies. Instead of 
discounting tuition for as many as 90% of their students, some schools are
actually lowering tuition  for everyone!</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Graduate Student Subsidies</STRONG>. Along these same lines,
undergraduate tuition often subsidizes the  education of graduate students,
especially in the social sciences and humanities where grant money  is
increasingly scarce. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Recruiting Costs</STRONG>. Visiting high schools. Providing toll-free
phone numbers. Designing and  maintaining ever-hipper web sites. Printing and
mailing glossy color viewbooks. Hosting campus  visits for students as well as
counselors. Recruiting costs at private four-year institutions now  average over
$1,500 per student enrolled. At four-year public colleges, that cost is a mere
$700. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Comparison shopping</STRONG>. As students and parents become more
sophisticated shoppers, they  expect more for their money. They expect colleges
to provide ample sports and recreational  facilities, adequate levels of campus
security, health care facilities, and extensive career placement  offices. Rooms
must be wired for computers, hair dryers and stereos. And dining halls must 
accommodate a variety of dietary requirements. All of this costs money. The
irony is, that the very  people who complain about rising college costs are in
part responsible for urging tuitions upward.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>College is less expensive than most people think</STRONG>. Not all
colleges cost $30,000 a year. In fact,  45% of all students go to community
colleges, where annual tuition averages about $1,200 and  another 30% attend
state universities, where annual tuition averages under $3,000. Even most 
private colleges charge you less than $10,000. Add $7,000 for room and board,
and for what  amounts to $40/day at a public school or $70/day at a private one,
you get a room (including heat,  water and electricity), three meals a day,
professional health care, recreational facilities, a wide  range of social and
cultural activities, counseling services, career assistance, and an education.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Trend B: Tuition Price Wall</STRONG><BR> Families can afford only so
many loans, while state and federal governments can fund only so many  grants.
The only other way to keep college affordable is for colleges to lower their
costs.  Fortunately many colleges recognize they can no longer just fiddle
around with tuition rates and  pricing strategies, but must do more to control
their costs. Michigan State has declared a cap on  tuition increases (not to
exceed inflation). Bennington (traditionally one of our nation's most  expensive
colleges) has undergone major restructuring to reduce tuition by 10% over the
next five  years. In fact, about 80% of our nation's colleges are taking lessons
from corporate America (or is  it Dilbert?) for help in improving their
operations. Business buzzwords like &quot;downsizing,&quot;  &quot;rightsizing,&quot;
&quot;repositioning,&quot; &quot;benchmarking,&quot; &quot;outsourcing,&quot;
and &quot;reengineering&quot; have become  campus mantras as schools find ways
to live within their means. With personnel costs making up  nearly 70% of some
collegiate budgets, what this really means is lots of layoffs, buyouts and early
 retirements. (Or, as they say in the business world, the &quot;release of
resources.&quot;) Is this a sign that  we're finally hitting a price wall? Let's
hope so! Otherwise, no matter how wise a financial aid  consumer you become,
private colleges may soon become unaffordable for most middle income  families.
</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Trend C: Bidding Wars</STRONG><BR> How do you feel about the car
buying process? Do you feel as though every one else gets a better  price? Or do
you feel pretty confident that you've beaten the salesperson at his or her own
game?  Some of us will do just about anything to avoid haggling over a price,
and feel very badly that some  financial aid administrators have been put in a
position where even the wealthiest parents and  students feel as though it's
their right to negotiate for more aid. Unfortunately, the process of  awarding
financial aid based entirely on &quot;need&quot; is now more of an ideal than an
actuality as more  and more schools use tuition discounts (or &quot;merit
scholarships&quot;) to meet recruiting goals. This  flexibility in awarding aid
has led to a deal making mentality in which, as <EM>The Washington Post 
</EM>editorialized, those who are more sophisticated or better advised will
haggle while the less  connected or less confident will not. This cleavage
between the &quot;information haves&quot; and &quot;information  have-nots&quot;
is doubly dangerous when located at the very gateway to education-based upward 
mobility.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Trend D: Your Fickle Uncle Sam</STRONG><BR> Uncle Sam is the main
dispenser of student aid. But Uncle changes his programs every year;  sometimes,
twice a year. His programs expand and shrink in dollar volume. Money that is 
authorized may never be appropriated. Money that is appropriated can be
rescinded. Eligibility for  the programs is as variable as the dollars. In Year
A you may be eligible. In Year B you are out. In  Year C you are in again-but
for a different amount of aid.<BR>
</P>
<P>This instability is not limited to dollars. It also extends to their
delivery. Forms may be late. Deep  questions must be resolved on such matters as
how to verify selective service registration and  citizenship status. The
academic year may have started, the dollars appropriated, but the machinery  for
delivering the dollars is still being tuned.<BR>
</P>
<P>As a second part of the budget battle, Uncle's giving less money to the
states for education, resulting  in similar instability at that level as well.
</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Trend E: Colleges Want You</STRONG><BR> Colleges want you. For all but
about 100 schools, selectivity is out the window. Today, 92% of all  students
are accepted by one of their top two college choices. It's a buyer's market. It
widens your  opportunity to shop wisely and well. And the more marketable you
are-good grades, leadership,  musical talent, athletic ability-the more
college-sponsored financial aid opportunities you will find.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Trend F: Fascination with Excellence</STRONG><BR> Major studies have
aroused public opinion about the decline of excellence in elementary and 
secondary schools. Nearly every proposed solution requires tons of money.
Lengthen the school  day. Lengthen the school year. Pay some teachers more than
others. Pay all teachers more. Make  everyone wear uniforms. Build single sex
schools. Plug a computer into every socket. Put a  computer in every home. Not
all solutions will be adopted. But some will, and money will flow.  While a
nation of literate, math whizzes sounds wonderful, in a finite economy, that
money must  come from somewhere. Most likely, it will come from money that
otherwise might have gone to  financing your higher education.<BR>
</P>
<P>But again, there is a upside. The enshrining of excellence legitimizes the
use of academic  scholarships, on the part of colleges, to attract
high-performance students. Expect continued growth  in such awards.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Trend G: The Web is Not a Medium, It's a Large</STRONG><BR> More and
more college information (like this book) is showing up on the Web. Nearly 1000 
four-year colleges maintain home pages containing everything from virtual campus
tours to virtual  course catalogues to virtual alumni news. You may also find
links to student home pages, letting you  &quot;meet&quot; potential classmates.
And you can sometimes follow a school's athletic teams, read its  student
newspaper, or visit the campus art museum. To find a school's address in
cyberspace, use a  search engine like Yahoo (<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com">http://www.yahoo.com</A>)
and look up the category, <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/education/universities">Education:
Colleges  and Universities</A>. Quite often you'll find the school's web address
is simply its name, for example, 
<A HREF="http://www.brown.edu">http://www.brown.edu</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P>For an overview of all the financial aid information in cyberspace, spend
some time with Mark  Kantrowitz at <A HREF="http://www.finaid.org">http://www.finaid.org</A>.
His site links to numerous resources including student aid  publications,
student aid organizations, scholarship databases and contact information for
financial  aid offices. <BR>
</P>
<P>To become a cyberspace activist, try the Alliance to Save Student Aid (<A
HREF="http://student-aid.nche.edu">http://student-aid.nche.edu</A>),  the
United States Student Association (<A HREF="http://essential.org/ussa">http://essential.org/ussa</A>),
or the National Association of  Graduate and Professional Students (<A
HREF="http://www.nagps.org/NAGPS/nagps-hp.html">http://
www.nagps.org/NAGPS/nagps-hp.html</A>). This last site  is updated most
frequently, and is useful for undergrads as well.<BR>
</P>
<P>Throughout this text we've included hyperlinked Web addresses where
appropriate, but like snail  mail addresses, they can change frequently (and
unlike snail mail, they are not reachable if so much  as a &quot;~&quot; or a &quot;/&quot;
is out of place). Your best bet is to visit Mark Kantrowitz (see above) and
learn to  use one of the many search engines to pinpoint the type of information
you need. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Trend H: A College Education still Pays</STRONG><BR> A college
education will prepare you for a fulfilling life-through broader cultural
awareness, deeper  knowledge, greater self-confidence, sounder health, richer
pleasures, keener citizenship and vastly  expanded resources for personal
happiness. But if philosophical reasons aren't enough, you'll be  pleased to
learn that college still helps you stay employed and earn more money. </P>

<P>Practically everyone we know equates the search for monetary help for
college with a search for  scholarships. Get rid of that belief quickly! And
repeat after us three times: To obtain financial aid,  sophisticated families:<BR>
* Present the family's situation for need analysis in a favorable manner.<BR> *
Apply to all the major assistance programs for which they are eligible.<BR> *
Apply early, accurately and honestly.<BR> * Select colleges that are most
likely to present them with a good aid package.<BR> * When appropriate, discuss
with the financial aid administrator the possibility of improving the aid  that
was offered.<BR> * Become knowledgeable about favorable options-commercial or
otherwise-for financing  educational expenses not covered by aid awards.<BR>
</P>
<P>These steps can be worth thousands of dollars. Any other approach will make
you the unknowing  looking for the unfindable. To avoid wasting time and money,
read this chapter on the myths that  envelop the financial aid field. And
remember: You don't profit from these beliefs; only the people  who sustain them
do.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3"><STRONG>Won't A Scholarship Replace My Money?</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Most people believe that scholarships put money in their pocket. Example: You
have been assessed  a $5,000 per year contribution to College X, a school that
costs more than that to attend. One  lucky day, you win a $1,000 scholarship.
You now say your contribution will be $4,000. Right?  Wrong. Your contribution
will still be $5,000. Most colleges take the $1,000, add it to your  available
family resources, and take away $1,000 of the loan or grant or work opportunity
that it  had planned to give you. In other words, scholarships can help pay your
college bill, but they do not  necessarily reduce your share of the bill. <BR>
<STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Question</STRONG>: If that is so, then why do clubs and
organizations work so hard to raise scholarship  money to help a particular
student? <STRONG>Answer</STRONG>: They are not familiar with financial aid
packaging  techniques. If they were, all that money raised by candy bar sales
and church suppers would go to a  different purpose.<BR>
<STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Question</STRONG>: Why do colleges urge students to find
scholarships? <STRONG>Answer</STRONG>: Your scholarship frees  collegiate aid
the school can now use to help another student. In other words, Student A's 
scholarship actually benefits Student B. This may not have been the donor's
intent, but it is a  generous act and should not go unthanked. Remember: Only
the money goes to the other student.  You retain the honor of having won the
scholarship.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Looking for Special Scholarships</STRONG><BR> Every day we get letters
from people who tell us their life stories and then ask &quot;is there a special
 scholarship for me?&quot; These letters sadden us, because we know the writers
haven't followed the  smart route for getting financial aid. Most financial aid
comes from Uncle Sam, your state, or your  college and is based on need. If
college costs more than your assessed contribution, you are eligible  for aid.
Your age, sex, race and career ambitions have nothing to do with it.<BR>
</P>
<P>Even if you do find a &quot;special scholarship,&quot; remember, there's a
big difference between being eligible  and winning. For example, your odds of
winning a 4H award (250 awards, 500,000 seniors as 4H  members), are only
2000:1. To increase your chances, you could purchase a one-week old piglet, 
feed it 20 times a day until it weighs 1700 pounds. Then rent a forklift and a
truck, take it to the  state fair, and hope it wins a blue ribbon in the heavy
hog competition. This might improve your  odds to 20 or 30 to 1. But what about
the costs of raising a 1700 pound porker?<BR>
</P>
<P>Think we're kidding? The Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers offered
these statistics from its last  Art &amp; Writing Awards contest: Students
submitted 250,000 art and writing entries. Of those,  12,000 writing and 14,000
art entries went on for national judging with five writing and five art  entries
each receiving $5,000 scholarships. In other words, odds of winning, 25,000:1.
Our advice:  Go the traditional route first. Then, if you have nothing else to
do, and you need practice filling out  applications, and you want to help the
Postal Service stay in the black, start looking for a &quot;special 
scholarship.&quot; You may even find one.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Unclaimed Scholarships</STRONG><BR> Q. I've read that millions in
scholarships goes unclaimed every year. Is this true?<BR> A. This claim is
usually made by computerized scholarship search companies who hope you will 
send them $25-$200 to find those millions. We're sure a few scholarships do go
unused every year,  but for once, would like to see companies citing these vast
untapped resources provide some  concrete examples. According to most financial
aid professionals, the millions you hear about are  unused employee tuition
benefits. See below.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Money From foundations &amp; Corporations</STRONG><BR> The College
Board estimates that private foundations and corporations give out nearly $8.1
billion  in aid, but it's not money you apply for directly. Foundation money
mainly goes directly to  universities where it's used to help students at the
doctoral or post-doctoral level. There is some  foundation money for
undergraduates, but that money usually has narrow local restrictions, e.g., for 
students in Teenytiny County. Such grants are well publicized in the local
paper. <BR>
</P>
<P>Corporate money usually goes to employees or children of employees, either
in the form of tuition  reimbursement or company scholarships. Some corporations
do give money to students whose  parents aren't on the payroll, but this is
usually done via grants to colleges; the colleges in turn select  the
recipients-you can't apply for them directly. The UPS Foundation, for example,
provides nearly  $1.6 million each year via 599 different private colleges and
universities.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Computerized Scholarship Searches</STRONG><BR>
<EM>If you need information on federal or state student aid</EM>, don't pay a
computer service. You can  learn all you need to know from this book or the free
pamphlets published by Uncle Sam and your  home state. <EM>If you need
information on collegiate student aid</EM>, don't pay a computer service. The 
college will tell you what you need to know. <EM>If you need information on
scholarships offered by  your employer or church</EM>, don't pay a computer
service. Ask your boss or minister. <EM>If you need  information on local
scholarships</EM>, don't pay a computer service. Check the HS bulletin board.<BR>
</P>
<P>Most experts agree, computerized search services seldom help you find
private aid. At their very  best, they might provide you with a few leads, as
opposed to actual dollars; but we've heard too  many horror stories of families
being duped out of processing fees to recommend this route to  anyone. Federal
investigations shut down many shady dealers every year, but anxious parents make
 an easy target, so a new crop of mail fraud perpetrators springs up every year.<BR>
</P>
<P>Are there any exceptions? Yes, if your state, or college, or high school has
a service you can use for  free or a small fee (you should NEVER pay more than
$50). Also, you can do a free search of  nearly 200,000 sources thanks to
fastWeb (<A HREF="http://www.studentservices.com/fastweb">http://www.studentservices.com/fastweb</A>).</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Income Shifting Doesn't Pay </STRONG><BR> Many people can't accept the
fact they are in a higher tax bracket than their children. They will shift 
assets from themselves to their offspring, thinking the income from these assets
will then be taxed at  a much lower rate. Sometimes they even construct
elaborate trusts with the help of lawyers and  accountants whose fees can run
upwards of $1,000.<BR>
</P>
<P>But oftentimes, all this maneuvering is for naught. Investment income in
excess of $1,300 for  children under 14 is taxed at the parent's rate. Tax rates
for trusts can be higher than tax rates for  most families. And student assets
are assessed at a much high rate than parent assets in determining  a family's
expected contribution to college costs. In short, some schemes should carry a
big red  warning label that says, &quot;Income Shifting Can Be Hazardous To Your
College Bills.&quot; </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Reading the Wrong References</STRONG><BR> Everybody knows the Consumer
Reports' Income Tax Guide takes a somewhat different slant to its  subject than
publications from the IRS. Consumer Reports' objective is to show you ways to
save  on taxes while the IRS seeks to extract the last drop of blood. You may
value the IRS guide for its  mechanical instructions, but not for its
substantive advice on holding on to more of your money. <BR>
</P>
<P>So it is with paying-for-college guides. Before you use one, make sure you
know its origin. Is it  written from the viewpoint of those who pay the money
(parents or students)? Or from those who  get the money (colleges or collegiate
organizations)? Or those who give the money (Uncle Sam and  the states)? The
guides may treat the same subject, but their treatment could be many dollars
(your  dollars) apart.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>&quot;Reading&quot; On-Line References</STRONG><BR> While some of the
best &quot;InfoBahn&quot; resources are education-oriented, remember, there is
no virtual  editor checking facts and biases, so if at all possible, try to
identify the information source and heed  the warnings above. Also, on a recent
browse, many of the sites which boasted helpful names  turned out to be
scholarship search firms. Avoid them (except for
<A HREF="http://www.studentservices.com/fastweb">fastWeb</A> mentioned
earlier). </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Reading Old References</STRONG><BR> When it comes to student aid, any
reference older than one year is out of date. If you use an older  reference,
you will be badly misled with regard to loan sources, subsidies, interest rates,
eligibility,  grants size, saving techniques, government regulations, and
college costs. Even web sites, which  should be easy to keep current, frequently
have very dated material. Look for the tag line showing  when the page was last
updated. This wisdom is especially true for students starting school in the 
1997/98 year as reauthorization of the entire Higher Education Act looms near!

<H3>Short Definitions </H3>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Grants and Scholarships </STRONG>are aid awards that do not have to be
repaid. They are gifts, however  some will require you to perform a service. The
recipient of a band scholarship, for instance, may  have to dress up in a
costume complete with spats, march around a football field, and blow into a 
tuba whenever the college so directs.<BR>
<STRONG>Loans</STRONG> are sums of money that must be repaid. To qualify as
financial aid, loans must carry a lower  interest charge than prevailing
commercial rates. They must also offer favorable repayment  provisions. For
example, in the Stafford Loan program, borrowers do not start paying interest on
 the loan nor do they have to retire any of the principal until after completing
their studies.<BR>
<STRONG>Work-Study</STRONG> counts as financial aid when employment is arranged
for you through the financial aid  office. Earnings from work you found yourself
are not included as part of financial aid. Such  earnings are added to the sum
you are judged capable of contributing to college costs.<BR>
<STRONG>Enrollment Status</STRONG> impacts on aid eligibility. To qualify for
most federal aid, you must be at least a  half-time student. Half-time is
generously defined. For example, it consists of only six semester or  quarter
hours per academic term for schools on the semester, quarter, or trimester
system. Also  under this system, the amount of your award changes with your
status. A $1,000 award for a  full-time student becomes a $750 award for a
three-quarter-time student (one majoring in the  waltz?) and $500 for a
half-time student. A tip: If you are a part-time student and wish to qualify for
 more aid, take one additional course each semester.<BR>
<STRONG>Accreditation</STRONG> is a process that ensures the school's programs
meet at least a minimum level of  quality. Make sure your school has been
accredited by a nationally recognized association. Not  only do you not want to
waste your tuition dollars getting a worthless education, but students who 
attend a non-accredited school will not qualify for federal or state student
aid.<BR>
<STRONG>Eligible Program </STRONG>is one that leads to a degree or certificate
and meets other &quot;integrity&quot; rules  established by Uncle Sam. To get
federal aid, you must be enrolled in an &quot;eligible program.&quot;  Students
working toward associate, bachelor, professional or graduate degrees need not
worry  about what constitutes an &quot;eligible program.&quot; Students looking
at proprietary schools (for a two  month study, for example, of computer repair)
should take heed. Most student aid fraud takes place  in vocational programs of
less than two years, and Uncle Sam is trying his best to separate the  wheat
from the chaff (shaft?). Note: Schools that receive more than 85% of their
funding from  federal student aid programs are immediately suspect. </P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>The 1st Player-The Student</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Financial aid programs define students by dependency status. They are either
dependent students or  independent students.<BR>
</P>
<P>A dependent student is one who is at least partially dependent on his or her
parents for support.  The income and assets of both student and parent are used
to develop the amount a family must  contribute to college costs.<BR>
</P>
<P>An independent student is not dependent on parental support. Only the
student's income and assets  (and that of any relevant spouse) are evaluated to
determine contribution to college costs. To be  considered independent, under
federal regulations, a student must meet one of the following  conditions:<BR>
1.	Be 24 years of age by December 31 of the award year (e.g., December 31, 1997
for the  1997/98 award year).<BR> 2.	Be an orphan or ward of the court.<BR>
3.	Be a veteran of the Armed Services.<BR> 4.	Be married or have legal
dependents other than a spouse.<BR> 5.	Be a professional student, or a graduate
student.<BR> 6.	Be judged independent by the financial aid administrator based
on documented unusual  circumstances.<BR>
</P>
<P>Establishing independence can give you an advantage: By not having to
include parental income and  assets on your financial aid application forms,
your college contribution will most likely be lower and  that will result in
more student aid. </P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>The 2nd Player-The Parents</STRONG></FONT><BR> Parents
may be loving, caring, supportive role models. The financial aid process doesn't
care. Its  main interest: Are they married, separated, divorced? Is there a
stepparent around who can foot the  bill? Here is the impact of marital status
on financial aid:</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Both Parents Are Alive and Married to Each Other.</STRONG> The income
and assets of both parents  are fair game for the financial aid computer.<BR>
<STRONG>Parents Are Divorced or Separated.</STRONG> The federal financial aid
form is only interested in the  income and assets of the parent with whom the
student lived for the majority of the twelve months  preceding the date of the
application.<BR>
<STRONG>A Parent Remarries.</STRONG> If the parent with whom the student lived
the greater part of the twelve  months preceding the date of the application
remarries, the stepparent's income and assets are  evaluated for a contribution
to college costs just as though he or she were a natural parent.<BR>
</P>
<P>These rules apply to federal aid and, generally, to state aid. The colleges,
when deciding how to  dispense their own money, are not bound by these rules.
They can probe deeply into the resources  of the divorced or absent parent who
got off scot-free under federal regs. </P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>The 3rd Player-The Colleges</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Colleges can be classified as either private or public.<BR>
</P>
<P>Private colleges can be more innovative in developing attractive financial
aid packages and tuition  assistance programs. They are not as circumscribed by
red tape as are tax-supported schools. </P>
<P>Private colleges also have more latitude in how to spend their money. Again,
it's their money, not  the taxpayer's (this also means they're apt to pry more
deeply into your family's finances as they try  to decide who is most deserving
of limited aid funds).<BR>
</P>
<P>Public colleges, being tax-supported, are usually less expensive. As a
general rule, students seldom  pay more than 30% of the actual cost of
education. The state pays the balance. Also, public  colleges have two sets of
fee structures: a lower one for state residents and a higher one for 
out-of-staters. At one time, it was easy to establish state residency to qualify
for the lower rate.  Today, it's more difficult. Most states have created
elaborate bureaucracies, the efficiency of which  appears to be judged in direct
proportion to the number of residency denials issued.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>The 4th Player-Federal Need Analysis Services</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Before a college can consider you for aid, it must know how much you can pay.
Families that can  pay $10,000 won't be eligible for as much as families that
can spare only $1,000. Determining how  much you can pay without becoming a
burden to your neighbors is called Need Analysis. Public  and private schools
now use what amounts to two varying systems. <BR>
</P>
<P>The process for determining eligibility for federal aid begins with a
longish form called the Free  Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Uncle
Sam prints 35 million FAFSAs each year,  and contracts with several regional
processing systems to send data from your completed FAFSA  to a central
processing system. <BR>
</P>
<P>Because the formula used to calculate your EFC is mandated by Uncle Sam, it
is known as the  Federal Methodology. And since all EFCs are calculated by the
same computer, you gain nothing  by submitting your FAFSA to one application
processor over another. So why are there different  processors? To spread out
the work load (and the federal contracts). </P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>The 5th Player-The College Board and College
Scholarship Service</STRONG></FONT><BR> The process of determining eligibility
for collegiate aid is another story. Why? There is no uniformity.  Many colleges
insist on additional knowledge about your family's finances to determine
eligibility for  their own programs. The College Board/College Scholarship
Service collects this information for  many of them using Financial Aid PROFILE.
The core of PROFILE is similar to the FAFSA, but  the College Board will
customize each form with additional questions as required by the colleges to 
which the student is applying for aid. You'll learn more about PROFILE in
<A HREF="ch06.html">Chapter 6</A>. For now, just  remember, it's important to
find out which schools require what forms to make sure you're  considered for
every aid source possible.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>The 6th Player-The Financial Aid Administrator</STRONG></FONT><BR>
For college students, the financial aid administrator can be the most important
person on campus.  The FAA can take the family contribution and-ouch-increase it
or-hooray-reduce it. The FAA can  draw from money under the college's direct
control or certify the student's eligibility for money not  under the college's
control. The FAA can decide on the contents of the student's aid package. Is it 
to be grants the student will not have to repay? Or will it all be loans? In
short, the FAA is the final  arbiter of how much the family must contribute to
college costs and how much outside help, and of  what kind, the family will
receive. <BR>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, FAAs are working under increasingly stressful conditions. At
most schools, they  have no real say in setting tuition rates, developing
operating budgets, or establishing enrollment  goals (in terms of numbers or
diversity), yet their offices are under constant pressure to make  certain
enough of the &quot;right&quot; students can afford tuition so the school meets
its enrollment goals and  balances its budget. The admission office wants to
know why musical Johnny didn't enroll (would an  extra $2,000 have done the
trick?) while the budget director wants to know why needy Dee Dee  got $3,000
when splitting that money between no-need, no-show Joey and low-need, no-show 
Marky would have brought in twice the tuition. To add to this stress, FAAs must
keep their aid  decisions ethical and consistent and make certain their schools
don't run afoul of one of the 7000  sections of Uncle Sam's Higher Education
Act. <BR>
</P>
<P>Get to know this player. He or she can make the difference between winning
and losing (and  besides, is truly one of the nicest, most helpful people you'll
meet on campus).</P>

<EM>Ubi Est Mea</EM>? (Old Latin Proverb, Translation: Where is Mine?)</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG><BR> The Concept of Need</STRONG></FONT><BR> Many
high school students believe they cannot receive financial aid for an expensive
private school  if their parents can afford to send them to a state school.
Others think that almost all financial aid is  set aside for minority students.
Of course, neither of these assumptions is true.<BR>
</P>
<P>Most financial aid is based on the concept of &quot;need.&quot; You cannot
understand financial aid without  understanding &quot;need.&quot; Need should
never be confused with &quot;needy.&quot; Need is a number-nothing  more,
nothing less. This is how to determine the need number:<BR> Visualize three
bars, Bar A, Bar B and Bar C. <BR>
</P>
<P>Bar A is the cost of attendance at the college of your choice.<BR> Bar B
will represent your family's expected contribution to college costs, as
determined by need  analysis (see previous chapter).<BR> And Bar C is the
amount of &quot;outside&quot; student aid you've received (e.g., private
scholarships and  veteran's benefits).<BR>
</P>
<P>Bar A-the cost of attendance-is a variable. It will vary from college to
college. It can even vary  within one school, depending on your student status,
the courses you take, how far away you live,  etc.<BR> Bar B and Bar C, which,
when added together make up your contribution, are constant (unless  there is a
drastic change in your family's situation). It doesn't matter where you plan to
buy your  education. The amount you must contribute from your own resources
should be the same.<BR>
</P>
<P>If Bar A is larger than Bar B and Bar C combined, you have financial need.<BR>
</P>
<P>Let's illustrate this concept of need for a family judged capable of
contributing $5,000 per year to  each of three colleges, College X which costs
$20,000; College Y which costs $10,000; and  College Z which costs $7,000.<BR>
</P>
<P>Assuming the student has found a $2,000 scholarship, that family's need is
$13,000 at College X;  $3,000 at College Y; and a big fat $0 at College Z.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Casual Observation:</STRONG></FONT><BR> With a central
processor and single, free application, it seems like Need Analysis should be
much  simpler now.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Behind the Scenes:</STRONG></FONT><BR> Colleges that
rely primarily on federal and state resources to make up financial aid packages
seem  satisfied with the current system of need analysis.<BR>
</P>
<P>Students, who for the most part no longer have to pay to have their aid
applications processed,  seem satisfied with the current system of need
analysis.<BR>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, colleges with a lot of institutional aid to distribute are
frustrated by this simplicity.  These schools feel the FAFSA does not gather
enough information to calculate a family's true ability  to pay. Accordingly,
many use an application form of their own (or PROFILE) to gather additional 
information and determine a student's &quot;need&quot; for institutional funds.
In short, awarding aid based  entirely on &quot;need&quot; (as determined by a
uniform method of need analysis) is an ideal rather than a  practice.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Finally: </STRONG></FONT><BR> Don't think the elements
that enter into the need calculation-the family contribution and the cost of 
college-are carved in stone. They are elastic. They can be stretched and
squeezed. This is not the  time to show you how to turn rock into play-doh. But
it is time to let you know it can be done. In 
<A HREF="ch07.html">Chapter 7</A> you will find a plethora of ideas for
stretching and squeezing.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Why Take Charge?</STRONG></FONT><BR> The admission
and financial aid cycles operate on different schedules. You select colleges in
the fall,  apply during the winter, and get acceptance decisions in early
spring. The financial aid cycle,  however, cannot be formally initiated until
after January first of the year in which you plan to attend  college (so the
computers can be fed exact data on how much your family earned the previous 
year). You submit your federal student aid application as soon after 1 January
as possible. Then you  are kept in the dark for several months before you learn
(1) how much you will have to contribute,  (2) whether you have need (3) whether
you qualify for need-based aid (4) and what your actual  financial aid package
will look like. Some years, students are asked to make their decision about 
what college to attend before they even receive their financial aid award
letter.<BR>
</P>
<P>If you want to assume your family contribution will not cause you a
cash-flow problem, and that  your need will be met at whatever college you elect
to attend, then you can trust the system and  submit all your applications in
the dark. You would be like the good soldier who carries out orders  even though
he does not understand them.<BR>
</P>
<P>But if you assume, realistically, that (1) your family contribution will
impose a cash-flow burden, (2)  your need will not be met in all cases or (3) if
it is met, it may be met in a manner that is financially  burdensome to you, you
cannot be a good soldier. You have to take charge of the process. In  doing so,
you protect your own interests. You guard against shocks and surprises. You
allot  adequate planning time. You improve your chances of having all your need
met and met in an  attractive manner. You may even succeed in lowering your
family contribution and qualifying for  more aid. What does all this mean? Let's
translate these general statements into specifics to illustrate  each point.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>What is Meant by Taking Charge?</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Taking charge is not complex. You won't have to enroll in a leadership or
muscle-building course or  graduate from Officer Candidate School. All you have
to do is read this chapter and act on the  advice it gives. The take-charge
process has three elements:<BR> 1.<STRONG> Learn the Money Numbers Ahead of
Time</STRONG>. Before you fill out any aid applications you  should know the
size of your family contribution, the costs of the colleges of your choice, and
the  resulting amount of need you will have at each of these schools.<BR> 2.
<STRONG>Execute the Application Process With Speed and Precision</STRONG>.
That's how you insure you'll be  first in line for aid, before the &quot;Sold
Out&quot; signs light up.<BR> 3. <STRONG>Know About Influence Points</STRONG>.
College selection, preparing for need analysis, the speed and  accuracy with
which you apply, the evaluation of aid offers, financial aid
administrators-these are all  influence points. How you handle yourself as you
approach these points will impact on your family  contribution, aid eligibility,
and size and composition of your aid award.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="5"><STRONG>Step One--Learn the Money Numbers Ahead of Time</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Let's begin with the first element of the take-charge process: Learn the Money
Numbers Ahead of  Time. You do that by securing answers to three questions:<BR>
</P>
<P>1. How much will our family be expected to contribute to college costs? For
federal aid purposes,  this will be a constant. For institutional aid, it may
vary.<BR> 2. What are the total costs at the college(s) of my choice? This is
also a variable.<BR> 3. What's our need going to be at each college of my
choice?<BR> Once you have the answer to Question #3-even if it's just an
approximation-you can begin some  sensible financial planning.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Question #1: How Much Will We Have To Pay?</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Family Contribution is made up of four elements: the Parents' Contribution from
Income, the  Parent's Contribution from Assets, the Student's Contribution from
Income and the Student's  Contribution from Assets (if you are an independent
student, the Family Contribution will  correspond to the Student's Contribution
from Income and from Assets). <BR> Family contribution for the purposes of
federal aid is calculated by Uncle Sam's central processor.  Family contribution
for the purposes of institutional aid might be calculated in a slightly
different  fashion, either by the College Scholarship Service or the institution
itself. In other words, two  different need analysis systems will be in
operation for the 1997/98 school year. Both operate on  the same principle. They
let you shelter some of your income and assets for taxes, living expenses  and
retirement. Then they want whatever's left.<BR>
</P>
<P>You should know that the income protection allowance-the money left to you
for shelter, food,  clothing, car operations, insurance and basic medical
care-is based on the Department of Labor's  &quot;low budget standard.&quot; If
you have gotten along on a low budget standard, the need analysis  formula will
fit you like a glove. But if you have become locked into a higher standard of
living, with  mortgage payments, fat utility bills, two cars, summer vacations,
an occasional trip to the theater,  and so on, the small allowance won't do you.
It won't cover expenses. And your assessed family  contribution will appear
impossibly large!<BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>The Federal Methodology</STRONG> is the system that will, more than
any other, impact on your eligibility  for student aid. It should concern you
the most. <BR>
<STRONG>The Simplified Need Test </STRONG>may be used by families whose total
parental adjusted gross incomes  (or, in the case of independent students, the
student and spouse's total adjusted gross incomes) are  under $50,000 and who
are eligible to file a 1040EZ, a 1040A, or who do not file a tax return at  all.
The simplified formula is essentially the same as the Federal Methodology with
the following  exception: It does not count either parent or student assets in
the family contribution calculation.<BR>
<STRONG>The Institutional Methodology</STRONG> is used primarily by higher
priced colleges to determine eligibility  for collegiate resources. The
Institutional Methodology is also essentially the same as the Federal 
Methodology, but with a few extra questions. For example, you will have to
report the value of your  home.<BR>
</P>
<P>Now it's time to calculate the family contribution under the Federal
Methodology. Dependent  Students should print out the worksheets in
<A HREF="app1.html">Appendix 1</A>. Independent Students go to
<A HREF="app1.html">Appendix 2 or  3</A>. Your calculations won't match to the
penny what the need analysis computer will determine. But  the result will be
close. Here are some things to know before you start filling in the figures:<BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Dependent Students</STRONG><BR> * All income and tax data comes
from the previous calendar year. If you start college in September  1997, the
previous calendar year is 1996.<BR> * All asset data is as of the date you
submit the need analysis form.<BR> * If your parents are divorced or separated,
use the income and asset figures of the parent with  whom you will live for the
greater part of the twelve months prior to the date of the application.<BR> *
If your parent has remarried, you must include your stepparent's income and
asset information.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Independent Student</STRONG><BR> * All income and tax data comes from
the previous calendar year. If you start college in September  1997, the
previous calendar year is 1996.<BR> * All asset data is as of the date you
submit the need analysis form.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Institutional Methodology</STRONG><BR> The worksheets allow you to
calculate your EFC under the Federal Methodology. To get an idea of  what
private colleges (and some out-of-state public colleges) will expect you to
contribute, just add  the equity in your home to the total value of your assets.
Your family contribution should increase by  an amount equal to about 5-6% of
this equity. Also, if your parents are divorced, you should  assume the private
college will ask about the income of the parent whose information is not listed
on  the FAFSA. <BR>
</P>
<P>If you want to prepare for the absolute worst, you should know that colleges
with their own aid  applications may ask for the current value of your
retirement accounts (IRAs, Keoghs, 401 (k)s,  single premiums) and question you
about sibling assets (to make sure you're not hiding money in  baby brother's
bank account). <BR>
</P>
<P>The good news is, the Institutional Methodology also gives you a couple of
extra allowances against  income. For example, you may rework the formula
subtracting unreimbursed medical expenses that  exceed 4% of your AGI and
tuition expenses of up to about $6,000 for each student enrolled in  private
secondary schools.<BR>
</P>
<P>Again, the Federal Methodology determines eligibility for federal aid (and
most state aid). It's a  strict formula with little room for negotiation. The
Institutional Methodology is used by many  colleges to award need-based
collegiate aid. The formula is not legislated so individual discretion  can be
wide and the room for negotiation sometimes great (depending on the policies of
the school,  and the desirability of the student).</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Question #2: How Much Will College Cost?</STRONG></FONT><BR>
OK. You have made an estimate of your family contribution. Now you need to know
how much it  will cost to attend the college of your choice. College costs and
tuition are not synonymous. College  costs-also known as &quot;Cost of
Attendance&quot; or &quot;Cost of Education&quot; or &quot;Student Expense
Budget&quot;-are  an aggregate of six elements.<BR> 1.<STRONG> Tuition and
fees</STRONG> are generally the same for all students. <BR> 2. <STRONG>Book
and supply </STRONG>expenditures depend on the courses you select. You can
purchase these items  in the college store, in the community, or you can save
some money and buy them in a used book  emporium.<BR> 3. <STRONG>Housing</STRONG>
charges may vary depending upon where you choose to live; in a dorm, off-campus
in  an apartment, or at home, in your old room.<BR> 4. <STRONG>Meal</STRONG>
charges can also vary. There is one figure if you purchase a school meal plan.
There is  another if you plan to cook for yourself (translation: pasta, pizza,
tuna, and fast food). And there is  still a third figure if you're enjoying
home-cooked meals-it makes no difference how much this  arrangement might add to
your parents' costs.<BR> 5. <STRONG>Miscellaneous</STRONG> expenses represent
all the money you spend at places other than the college.  This includes upkeep
of clothing, health insurance, even a small allowance for CDs, pizzas, and an 
occasional night out. The personal expense category can be very flexible. If you
are handicapped,  for instance, or have child care bills to shoulder, this item
can be set very high.<BR> 6. <STRONG>Transportation</STRONG>, too, is
flexible. It may be based on two or three roundtrip flights between a  distant
campus and home or it may represent commuting expenses.<BR>
</P>
<P>Expense budgets are established by the aid administrator for the different
categories of students  who attend a typical college. There may be a separate
budget for dependent students living in the  dorm, dependent students in an
apartment, dependent students who live at home, independent  students in each of
these categories, and subcategories for single and married independent students.
 In addition, the aid administrator will make special allowances in the budget
for the unique problems  of the handicapped. For example:</P>
<PRE>Single Student, Lives at Home		$11,210
Single Student, Lives in Dorm		$14,590
Single Student, Lives in Own Apartment	$15,210
Married Student, Child Care Expenses	$20,830</PRE>
<P><BR> Here are some points to ponder about expense budgets:<BR> * Some
items in the expense budget, such as room and board when you live at home, may
not  represent a special outlay for your family. Also, by being frugal, your
actual expenditures may be  less than the college has allowed.<BR> * If some of
your college-related expenses do not appear to be accurately reflected in the
expense  budget, let the financial aid administrator know. Any increase in the
expense budget increases your  eligibility for financial aid.<BR>
</P>
<P>You can get excellent estimates of college costs from current editions of
most of the comprehensive  college guides (See your guidance counselor). Of
course, you will want to augment this information  by writing directly to
colleges and asking for their most current catalogue. Also remember, if the 
information you're using is for the 1996/97 year, and you aren't starting
college until 1997/98, you  should add 6% to the total cost figure to get a
better idea of the rate you'll be paying.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Question #3: What's My Need?</STRONG></FONT><BR> Now
you have all the materials you need to answer the third question: How much need
will I have  at each college of my choice? You do that by comparing your Family
Contribution, as determined  from <A HREF="app1.html">Appendix 1, 2, or 3</A>,
with the Cost of Attendance (all six elements) at each school that  interests
you. Remember: If you're applying to one of the wealthier private schools you
should  perform this comparison twice: once using the federal methodology to
determine your eligibility for  federal aid, and again using the institutional
methodology to determine your eligibility for institutional  aid.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="5"><STRONG>Step Two--Execute the Process with Speed and Precision</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Now that you've finished the first take charge step (Learn the Money Numbers
Ahead of Time),  you can initiate the second element: Execute the Application
Process With Speed and Precision.  You submit your aid application as soon after
the first of the year as possible. We say &quot;as soon  after&quot; because a
great many programs operate on a first-come, first-served basis.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Which form should you fill out? </STRONG><BR> That's up to the
colleges and your home state. Be sure to find out before New Year's Day. Here 
are some general guidelines: Everyone must file the Free Application for Federal
Student Aid  (FAFSA) to be considered for federal student assistance. In
addition, some families will have to use  the College Scholarship Service's
Financial Aid PROFILE and/or a supplemental form from their  home state to be
considered for collegiate or state resources. Finally, some families will have
to  complete an institutional aid form and send it directly to the college they
hope to attend. In other  words, you may have to file one, two, three or four
forms depending on the wishes of your home  state and the schools to which you
apply. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Why so many forms? </STRONG><BR> Simple. College is expensive and
there's not enough financial aid for everyone, so schools have to  figure out
who needs money the most. When Congress reauthorized the Higher Education Act,
it  removed &quot;home equity&quot; from the need analysis calculation. Suddenly
zillions more people (mostly  middle class people) became eligible for aid.
Unfortunately, Congress did not appropriate more  money to cover its largess so
aid administrators had to tell families, &quot;Sorry, I know you qualify for 
aid, but we don't have any money to give you.&quot; Their solution: (1) Use
FAFSA results to award  federal aid to all who qualify; (2) Use PROFILE and
institutional aid application results to find out  more about a family's
finances; (3) adjust the family contribution accordingly; (4) award collegiate 
resources to the still needy; and (5) suggest politely that everyone else borrow
more money.<BR>
</P>
<P>Students applying to in-state schools will frequently get by with filing
just the FAFSA. Students  applying to more expensive schools where federal and
state aid doesn't cover the tuition bill (e.g.,  private schools and
out-of-state public schools) will usually have to complete multiple forms, as 
described above. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Where do you get the forms and what do you do with them? </STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Paper FAFSAs</STRONG> come from your guidance office or college
financial aid office. You fill it out as  soon after January 1 as possible and
snail mail it to the regional processor listed on the form. You  pay no fee.<BR>
<STRONG>Electronic FAFSAs</STRONG> may be filed directly with the central
processor using FAFSA Express.  Students will find FAFSA Express at selected
schools and libraries, or they may download their  own copy from Uncle Sam's
Office of Postsecondary Education web site  (<A
HREF="http://www.ed.gov/offices/OPE/express.html">http://www.ed.gov/offices/OPE/express.html</A>).
The screen resembles the paper FAFSA and  includes on-line help and
instructions. Internal edits help prevent errors and reduce rejections. 
Students using FAFSA Express still have to print the signature and certification
page, sign it, and  mail it to their regional processor (who will in turn send a
signature &quot;flag&quot; to the central processor),  but everything else may
be sent electronically. <BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>If possible, try to file electronically! </EM>Last year, processor
snafus led to huge backlogs of paper  aid applications and made it impossible
for aid administrators to build timely financial aid packages.  Electronic
filers experienced none of these problems, however, they accounted for only
about  8,000 of the 4.8 million FAFSAs. <BR>
<STRONG>State aid applications</STRONG> (if you need one), come either from
your home state (see <A HREF="ch11.html">Chapter 11</A>) or  your guidance
office. Again, you fill it out (usually after January 1) and send it to the
address listed  on the form. You pay no fee.<BR>
<STRONG>PROFILE </STRONG>registration booklets will be in your guidance office
this September. If any of your  schools are listed in the registration booklet,
complete the enclosed registration form and return it to  CSS via mail or fax.
You may also register electronically by visiting 
<A HREF="http://www.collegeboard.org/css/html/proform.html">http://www.collegeboard.org/css/html/proform.html</A>.
CSS then sends you a packet of forms,  customized with each school's financial
aid questions. The basic PROFILE is similar to the FAFSA,  but CSS has
accumulated a batch of nearly 200 additional questions that schools may also
choose  to ask you. These questions pry into everything from the student's
intended career objective, to  whether the student has applied for any outside
scholarships, to whether any income generating  assets have recently been sold
(and the purpose for which they were sold), to the year, make and  model of all
the family's motor vehicles. You pay a fee for all this fun; $5 just to
register, then  $14.50 per school.<BR>
</P>
<P>PROFILEs may be filed prior to January 1 enabling financial aid
administrators to get a head start  on estimating financial aid packages. Check
your schools' filing deadlines carefully.<BR> Renewal FAFSAs will come in the
mail beginning mid-November, to students who filed a FAFSA  during the 1996/97
award year. Renewal FAFSAs are pre-printed with much of the data you  provided
last year, so unless there's a change in information, you can skip over many of
the  questions. If you are using the renewal application be certain to check the
names (and codes) of the  colleges and state agencies that are to receive the
results of your needs analysis. Uncle Sam noted  that last year many students
neglected to do this, then wondered why the financial aid office never  got a
copy of their processed forms.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Avoid Making Mistakes</STRONG><BR> Over 1.6 million students filed
correction applications last year, listing new information or fixing  errors. By
filing a mistake-free form, you can be ahead of all those people in the chow
line.<BR>
<STRONG>* Name, Rank and Serial Number</STRONG>. You must have a social
security number to apply for financial  aid. Furthermore, the Department of
Education now verifies every applicant's name, social security  and date of
birth with the Social Security Administration. To minimize problems, avoid using
 nicknames. The computer doesn't know whether &quot;Bill Reese&quot; and &quot;William
Reese, Jr.&quot; are the same  person. Married or divorced students must be
especially careful as their last names may have  changed, while their social
security numbers have not.<BR>
<STRONG>* January 1</STRONG>. FAFSAs cannot be dated or submitted before
January 1.<BR> * Date Due. Be sure you know when colleges want you to submit
the forms. If you apply to six  colleges and each has a different deadline,
submit the forms in time to meet the earliest deadline.  Both FAFSA and PROFILE,
remember, go to the colleges via a middleman, so you should start  the process
four to six weeks before your due dates. <BR>
<STRONG>* Use the Right Forms</STRONG>. In trying to simplify the aid process
by standardizing the application,  Uncle has made things more complex for some
students who must now file a FAFSA as well as use  PROFILE. Read each school's
financial aid literature closely to make sure you know which forms  to file.<BR>
<STRONG>* Identify Your College Completely</STRONG>. 8,200 schools participate
in Uncle Sam's student aid  programs. If Uncle included an institutional code
list with each FAFSA packet, he would have no  money left to fund aid programs,
so it's your responsibility to list schools correctly-this means you  must
record the full name and complete address of every school that should receive
your financial  aid information. Remember &quot;U. of M.&quot; could mean
Maryland or Michigan. &quot;University of California&quot;  could mean the
campus at Davis or Irvine. <BR>
<STRONG>* Estimating Information</STRONG>. If the earliest filing date falls
before your mom and dad have done their  income taxes, you can use income and
tax estimates on the FAFSA. If you note, later on, that your  estimates were
incorrect, you'll have to provide corrections. Estimators are also the most
likely  candidates for verification (see below).<BR>
<STRONG>* Comparison Between Need Analysis Forms and IRS Forms</STRONG>.
College financial aid  administrators verify about 30% of all financial aid
forms. That's when you get to produce copies of  tax forms and other documents
for a comparison check. Most FAFSAs are selected based on  &quot;preestablished
criteria,&quot; which is bureaucratese for &quot;something smells fishy.&quot;
Lesson: Be accurate  and honest in submitting your data. If you are outside a
$400 tolerance range, and did not provide  any corrections, the college will
know and you will be asked to make corrections. Items on the  FAFSA that must
match your 1040 include adjusted gross income, income tax paid and number of 
exemptions. Note: Some schools ask all their students for copies of their tax
returns-as a matter of  policy.<BR>
<STRONG>* A Good Use of the Winter Holiday</STRONG>. On a quiet day, switch off
the TV, sit down with your  family, an income tax form and a financial aid
application, and put red circles around the common  items. At that time, you may
wish to complete the tax return so you can get a headstart on filling out  the
FAFSA. Remind mom and dad that the FAFSA asks whether the aid application was
filled out  using estimated data or a completed 1040 (which is not the same as a
filed 1040). If you're going to  owe taxes, you can let your 1040 sit around
until April 15th, but get it filled out ASAP!<BR>
<STRONG>* Be Consistent</STRONG>. The FAFSA processor is programmed to
crosscheck data and flag questionable  applications for verification. <EM>Example
One</EM>: A dependent student claims a one-parent family but  records income for
two parents. <EM>Example Two</EM>: A family shows $100,000 in savings, but no 
unearned income. Conversely, a family shows $10,000 in unearned income, but has
no assets.  There should be some correlation between the value of your savings
and investments and the  amount of your unearned income. Otherwise, lights will
flash, bells will sound, and investment advice  will come pouring in (or, you'll
be asked to share your investment secrets). In either case, you're a  candidate
for verification. <BR>
<STRONG>* Change in Status</STRONG>. If, after you submit your FAFSA, there is
a change in your status (a family  death, disability, prolonged unemployment,
divorce or separation), notify the college immediately.  Financial aid
administrators cannot make direct changes to your EFC, however, they can adjust 
individual data elements (e.g., lower your reportable income or assets) to
reflect your new situation. <BR>
<STRONG>* Early Bird Gets the Worm</STRONG>. Apply for financial assistance as
early as possible. Schools can  often meet the needs of the first applicants,
and then run out of assistance money for the late  applicants. <BR>
<STRONG>* Don't Make Mistakes</STRONG> when filling out your aid applications.
Mistakes cause the form to  bounce. By the time you make corrections and
resubmit it, you will find yourself at the end of the  line and the money gone.
Most common mistakes: Omitting social security number, recording an  incorrect
social security number, leaving questions blank when you mean zero, (write &quot;0&quot;),
using  &quot;white-out,&quot; entering a range of figures such as $200-400,
entering cents, leaving off numbers  ($5,000 vs. $50,000), writing illegibly,
and writing in the margins.<BR>
<STRONG>* Don't forget to sign the form</STRONG>. The FAFSA now includes the
Statement of Educational Purpose  in which you promise to use your student aid
for XYZ College only. Whether you file a paper  FAFSA or use an electronic
version, you must sign a hard copy of this form before Uncle will  authorize any
funds. <BR>
<STRONG>* Don't Falsify Anything</STRONG>. As the top of the FAFSA clearly
states, &quot;If you purposely give false or  misleading information on this
form, you may be fined $10,000, sent to prison or both.&quot; And don't  expect
the financial planner you hired to bail you out.<BR>
<STRONG>* Make Copies</STRONG> of all financial aid forms and your responses to
any information requests that may  come from Uncle Sam, the need analysis
processor or the colleges. Make sure to send the original,  however, and keep
the copy for yourself.<BR>
<STRONG>* If You are Male (between 18 and 25), Register for Selective Service</STRONG>.
You will not be  eligible for financial aid unless you do. If you are exempt
from registering for the draft, you must file  a statement accordingly. <BR>
<STRONG>* If necessary, include the processing fee</STRONG>. The FAFSA is free,
but PROFILE costs $5 to  register and $14.50 for each school that is to receive
a report! (This cost is a big reason to make  sure you don't waste your time on
PROFILE unless your college asks you to!)</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>What Happens Now?</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<STRONG>The FAFSA</STRONG><BR> You send your FAFSA to an application processor
(the address appears on your form). Here's an  outline of what happens next.<BR>
1. 1.The processor scans in your data (or keys it in, if necessary) and
transmits it to a central  processor<BR> 2. The central processor matches your
application information against several national databases to  verify your
eligibility for aid. For example, it checks your Selective Service status, your
Social  Security number, and your citizenship status.<BR> 3. The central
processor checks your data for inconsistencies and contradictions.<BR> 4. The
central processor evaluates your finances and calculates your &quot;Expected
Family  Contribution&quot; (EFC). <BR> 5. The central processor incorporates
your EFC into a multi-part eligibility document called a  Student Aid Report
(SAR).<BR> 6. The central processor sends you a copy of your SAR. Review this
report carefully to make  certain your EFC was calculated using the accurate
information. Also take a look at your EFC. If  there's an &quot;*&quot; next to
it, you've been selected as a candidate for verification. If there's a &quot;C&quot;
next to  it, you're a big winner-the central processor has identified an
eligibility problem which must be  resolved before you receive any student aid
at all. <BR> 7. The processor sends a more detailed analysis (called an
Institutional Student Information Record,  or ISIR) to all the colleges you
named.<BR> 8. The central processor transmits your data to your state higher
education agency.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>PROFILE</STRONG></FONT><BR> PROFILE goes back to the
College Scholarship Service for processing. For yet another fee  ($5.50) CSS
will send a Data Confirmation Report along with your Acknowledgment. This Report
 shows what information CSS entered from your application and whether CSS found
any problems  with the way you completed PROFILE. If you see a mistake, CSS says
it will correct it at no  charge. Otherwise, if you need to change or update any
information, you should send this new data  directly to your school.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>The Financial Aid Package</STRONG></FONT><BR> The
financial aid administrator (FAA) now rolls up his or her sleeves and goes to
work. First, the  FAA determines your cost of attendance (or student expense
budget). Second, the FAA reviews  your expected family contribution, compares it
your cost of attendance, and establishes your need  (and eligibility) for most
state and federal programs. Third, the FAA takes another look at your  EFC to
determine your eligibility for collegiate awards-about 35% of all FAAs will
adjust the  contribution based on policies of their office. And finally, the FAA
builds your Financial Aid  Package.<BR>
</P>
<P>Before they build any aid packages, however, the financial aid staff will
sit down and establish a  packaging philosophy-a set of guidelines to ensure
consistency and equity in their treatment of all aid  applicants. Unfortunately,
each school has its own ideas about consistency and equity which means  your
need will probably be met differently at each school to which you apply. For
example, some  schools award every student the maximum Stafford possible. Others
award grant aid first, then  self-help (loans and work). Some have rules
prescribing the ratio of grants to loans, a ratio that can  vary with the income
of the aid applicant (lower income students receiving more grants than loans, 
upper income students receiving mostly loans). Even if they don't state their
packaging philosophy in  their aid literature (few schools do), many schools
will present you with case studies showing aid  combinations for families at
different income levels which can tell you everything you need to know!<BR>
</P>
<P><EM>In general, when awarding money from programs they administer but do
not fund (i.e.,  federal programs), colleges tend to give priority to the
neediest of the able. When awarding  money from their own funds, colleges tend
to give priority to the ablest of the needy.</EM></P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Layer One-Pell and State Grants</STRONG></FONT><BR>
The Pell Grant is the foundation of every aid package (see <A HREF="ch10.html">Chapter
10</A>). Only students with EFCs  under about $2,500 are eligible for Pells.
State grants make up the other part of Layer One. Most  states require students
to attend an in-state college to qualify for a state award.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Layer Two-Outside Scholarships</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Next, the aid administrator gleefully incorporates any outside scholarships you
may have found  (that's money the school need not worry about providing you).
This includes the $500 awarded you  by your church or temple, as well as the
$5,000 from your parent's boss.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Layer Three-Federal Programs</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Third, if you still have need (i.e., if the cost of college exceeds your EFC
plus your Pell Grant plus  your state grant plus your outside scholarships) then
the FAA draws on four other federal programs:  Stafford Loans, Perkins Loans,
Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, and Work-Study  (For programs
specifics, see <A HREF="ch10.html">Chapter 10</A>). The way FAAs use these
programs varies from school  to school according to their packaging philosophy
and the size of their student aid budget. In  addition to the considerations
described earlier, some have policies in which they first award  Stafford loans
(which are limitless), preserving (scarcer) federal resources for students who
then still  have need. Others (primarily the less expensive schools) do the
reverse, using Stafford money as a  last resort. </P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Layer Four-Collegiate Resources</STRONG></FONT><BR> If
the cost of college is still greater than all of your resources (your EFC plus
money from all the aid  programs just mentioned), the FAA can do one of three
things: <BR> 1. Give you a huge award from the college's own resources. These
resources include low interest  loans and collegiate scholarships. The richer
the college, the more resources it will have for this layer  of the package.<BR>
2. Use the information you provided via PROFILE or the school's own aid
application (i.e., the  Institutional Methodology) to adjust your family
contribution and if you still have need, give you  funds from the college's own
resources.<BR> 3. Apologize for not being able to meet your financial need
fully and suggest your parents borrow  money under Uncle Sam's PLUS program (or
use a commercial loan source) to help ease any cash  flow problems.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Layer Five-PLUS Loans</STRONG></FONT><BR> Finally, the
aid administrator will approve you for a PLUS loan. The size of your loan is
limited to  the total program cost less any financial aid you may have received.
In other words, if school costs  $10,000 and you receive $5,000 in financial
aid, you may receive a PLUS loan of $5,000. The size  of your family
contribution does not matter so long as your parents are credit worthy. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Families Without Financial Need</STRONG><BR> If the family has no
financial need and the school really wants the student, the FAA may offer the 
student a non-need based award such as an academic scholarship.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>The Award Letter</STRONG></FONT><BR> The FAA will
present your aid package in the form of an award letter. These letters vary in
format,  but they all contain the following items:<BR> 1. A statement of the
expense budget developed for you. Again, this varies based on factors like 
whether you plan to live on- or off-campus.<BR> 2. Your expected family
contribution, as calculated under the federal methodology and the  institutional
methodology.<BR> 3. The amount of your need.<BR> 4. A description of how all
or part of that need is to be met, listing each aid source and dollar  amount.<BR>
5. A suspense date by when you must return the award letter. <BR> 6.
Information on available procedures for &quot;appealing&quot; any information in
the award letter with  which you disagree.<BR>
</P>
<P>If there is something you don't understand about the offer, or if you notice
your EFC is different than  what was sent to you by the processor on your
Student Aid Report, ask the school for clarification.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Comparing Your Award Letters</STRONG><BR> While it's seldom wise to
make the agonizing, final decision concerning which college to attend  based on
money issues alone, it's no longer realistic to exclude money as a factor. That
said, it's  important to make sure you're not just looking at the schools'
sticker prices (that would be like  comparing apples and oranges). Instead, you
have to evaluate how much each school is going to  cost your family in
out-of-pocket money. And to make certain you're not then comparing Granny 
Smiths with Red Delicious, be sure to factor in the amount of loan money you'll
eventually have to  repay. You might find it helpful to create a worksheet
(either on paper or a spreadsheet) with a  side-by-side comparison of each
school's package.<BR>
</P>
<P>Compare the award letters from all the colleges to which you applied. But
don't delay responding to  an award letter because you are still waiting for
letters from other colleges. If you don't reply by the  required date, your
award will be canceled and the money freed up for some other deserving  student.
(Colleges can't hold money). Responding to the award letter does not commit you
to  attendance. It just safeguards your award, should you elect to go to that
college. <BR>
</P>
<P>In responding to the award letter, your have four choices: You can accept
the award in its entirety;  accept some components of the award and reject
others; reject the award entirely; or request a  revision in the composition of
awards (more grants, less loans).</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Appealing Your Award</STRONG><BR> Few people still ask us if they can
challenge the admission decision. Instead, everyone wants to  know if they can
negotiate their aid package. Our answer? An unqualified &quot;Maybe.&quot; With
college  costs increasing at a faster rate than grant aid, this topic is
becoming increasingly complex and  sensitive. Therefore, before you bully your
way into a financial aid office demanding a recount, it's  important to know
what actions will help (or hurt) your cause. Your success in appealing an award 
depends on a great number of factors: <BR> 1.<EM> The availability of
discretionary funds</EM>. Private colleges usually have more money for 
scholarships than public universities. They also have greater flexibility in how
they distribute their  money. In any case, make your request as early as
possible, because money runs out fast even at  our wealthiest schools!<BR> 2.
<EM>The skill (and tact) with which you present your case</EM>. If your family
has had a recent change  in situation, document the change carefully and contact
the FAA. He or she cannot just change your  EFC, but he or she can adjust
individual data elements that go into its calculation to allow for special 
conditions. These are usually unpleasant things like job loss, death,
disability, divorce, or  unexpected or unusually high medical expenses. In these
cases, the FAA will probably lower the  family's income figure and recalculate.
You might also ask the FAA to reduce the value of  reportable assets. For
example, you can easily argue a recent job loss will not only affect a family's 
earnings, but also eat into its savings.<BR> 3. <EM>The caliber of the student</EM>.
If the school really wants you to enroll, the FAA can sometimes be  of more
help, usually by adjusting the composition of your aid package. Remember: Grants
are  infinitely more desirable than loans. Here's also where the line between &quot;financial
aid&quot; and  &quot;enrollment management&quot; can begin to blur: Informal
studies show it takes about $10,000 (spread  out over four years) to nab a
student who might otherwise not consider a particular school. Are you  the kind
of student on the college's shopping list?</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Will the Need-Based Route Satisfy My Need?</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Maybe. Maybe not. If it does, it could be a dream package. But, it could also be
an offer that  leaves you a thousand dollars short or mired deeply in debt.
Remember:<BR> * The college may not have enough resources to help all
applicants.<BR> * Different colleges may assess your need differently. If you
apply to three schools, each of which  costs $8,000 more than your family's EFC,
you may be offered three very different packages,  ranging from the attractive
to the unacceptable.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Step Three--Knowing the Influence Points</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Now that you've mastered the mechanics of need analysis, it's time for the third

<P><FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Tilting Things Your Way</STRONG></FONT><BR> There
are six strategies for tilting the financial aid process in your favor: <BR>
1-Reduce the Family Contribution<BR> 2-Increase the Cost of Attendance<BR>
3-Obtain an Improved Aid Package<BR> 4-Replace Your Money with OPM (Other
People's Money)<BR> 5-Lower the Cost of College<BR> 6-Improve your Cash Flow<BR>
</P>
<P>Only two of these are mutually exclusive. The Napoleon of aid seekers would
probably investigate  all six.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Strategy 1-Reduce the Family Contribution</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<STRONG>Objective: </STRONG>Reduce your family contribution so your need
becomes larger. In other words, make  yourself eligible for more student
assistance. We offer this advice with the hope you'll be able to  distinguish
between working with the system and cheating it. There's a fine line between
getting your  fair share, and abusing financial aid rules at the expense of
needier students. Many schools have  fixed (small) amounts of aid to distribute,
so increasing one student's award is only possible by  decreasing another's.
Also remember, most aid is &quot;need-based,&quot; not &quot;want-based.&quot;
That said, here  are some ideas to ponder.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Thoroughly Understand Need Analysis </STRONG><BR> We assume that while
reading <A HREF="ch06.html">Chapter 6</A> you took the time to complete the
worksheets in 
<A HREF="app1.html">Appendix 1, 2, or 3</A> and noted the various factors
considered, including the percentages and  weights assigned to your data. These
are the items that should have caught your eye.<BR>
<STRONG>1. Asset Assessment Rates.</STRONG> A dependent student does not rate
an asset protection allowance.  The dependent student's assets are taxed at 35%
of their value. Parents do rate an asset protection  allowance. Money held by
parents, as you trace it through the formula, is taxed about 5.6%. That's  quite
a difference! $35,000 in junior's bank account becomes a $12,250 contribution to
college  costs. The same $35,000 in the parental account becomes a mere $1,960
contribution. Lesson:  Accumulate money for college, yes. But don't be so quick
to accumulate in the child's name.<BR>
<STRONG>2. The Previous Year Rule.</STRONG> Your 1996 earnings determine your
aid eligibility for the 1997/98  academic year. Your 1997 earnings impact on the
1998/99 year. If your income fluctuates, and you  have control over the
fluctuations, you might defer income from the base year to the next. That  would
enhance your eligibility in the coming academic year. What about the next base
year? Life is  filled with soap opera twists (and the whole higher education act
is up for reauthorization in  1997/98). Take it one year at a time.<BR>
<STRONG>3. Business Property.</STRONG> Assets that are part of a business rate
an adjustment factor (e.g., 40% of  net worth up to $85,000 ). Think hard. Do
you have any source of income, from a hobby or  property or whatever, that you
can turn into a business? Or can you shift assets to a sub-S  corporation in
which your family holds a controlling 51% interest while people outside the need
 analysis formula (your grandmother?) hold 49%? That's a real one-two punch. Not
only do you get  the asset value reduced by the net worth adjustment, but there
is a second reduction stemming from  the 49% value transfer outside the
immediate family. All this will make your tax return more  complex, but the
trade-off is a sharply reduced contribution to college costs.<BR>
<STRONG>4. Consumer Debt.</STRONG> Under need analysis, you get no write off
for consumer debt. If you owe the  bank $20,000 in car payments, that's your
problem. But let's say you own stocks and have a  brokerage account that lets
you borrow against your portfolio. If you draw $20,000 from this  account to
finish paying for the car, you reduce the value of your reportable assets by
that amount.  You pay less for college and have a new car to drive! </P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3"><STRONG>Reduce the Value of Assets you Report for Need Analysis</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Parental assets count less than student assets. Business assets count less than
personal assets. But  there is more.<BR> 1. Home equity is not a reportable
asset under the Federal Methodology. So what happens if you  use savings to pay
down your home mortgage? You'll probably be in a much better position to 
qualify for a low-interest federal loan! (although aid administrators are free
to ask questions about  home equity, and may reserve the school's own funds for
renters (and expect families with pricey  homes and no mortgage to borrow
against this great asset).<BR> 2. Do you need to make a large purchase before
you sign and date your FAFSA? We've already  suggested buying a car. How about a
new stereo, refrigerator or washer-dryer? Pay cash, if you  can. That will
reduce your reportable assets-and provide you with good music, some cold drinks 
and a few clean clothes.<BR> 3. If you've been saving in your child's name, get
his or her permission to use that money to pay  your entire EFC for the first
year of college. (You could also use the money for something smaller,  like the
increasingly essential personal computer). This will improve your chances for
aid during  years two, three, and four. Warning: This won't work at all schools.
One of the Ivy's, for example,  expects 35% of a student's assets in Year One,
35% of the remaining balance in Year Two, etc.  Tricky, tricky, tricky!</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3"><STRONG>Declare Yourself Independent </STRONG></FONT><BR>
Independent students do not include their parents' income and assets in their
need analysis  calculation; only their own, (generally) more limited resources.
Hence, their contribution will usually  be smaller, and their need larger.
Should you try to declare yourself independent then, to gain  access to more
aid? Certainly, if you are really independent and can convince the financial aid
 administrator accordingly. Absolutely not, if it is a ploy. <STRONG>Please
note</STRONG>: Single, undergraduate  students under the age of 24 are
considered &quot;dependent&quot; in all cases, except at the discretion of the 
financial aid administrator.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Use a More Favorable Need Analysis Method</STRONG><BR> Families with
adjusted gross incomes under $50,000 who are eligible to file a 1040A or 1040EZ 
(even if they actually file a regular 1040) may use the Simplified Methodology
to calculate family  contribution. In other words, parent and student assets are
not considered for need analysis. If you  are eligible to file a 1040A or 1040EZ
and can keep your AGI under $50,000, do so! </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Reduce Your Reportable Income</STRONG><BR> 1. <EM>Take less pay</EM>.
Is there any way to defer year-end bonuses? Remember, need analysis looks at 
previous year income-1996 for the 1997/98 award year. As Uncle Sam monitors the
impact of the  Higher Education Act on the federal budget and on middle income
families, who knows what  program adjustments he'll make in. With constantly
changing rules, if you can increase your eligibility  even for a year, do it!<BR>
2. <EM>Accelerate Income</EM>. If your student won't start college until 1998,
think of ways to lower your  1997 income. For example, accelerate bonuses into
1996 and make certain you don't receive any  1996 state or local tax refunds in
1997. <BR> 3. <EM>Accelerate or postpone gains</EM>. If you plan to sell
stocks or property, do it two years before  college, or wait until your student
has graduated. Capital gains count as income which is heavily  &quot;taxed&quot;
by the need analysis system. Also, watch out for year-end dividends on mutual
funds. If the  fund you're eying is about to pay a dividend, wait until after
the payout before you buy. You'll get  more shares for your money, and not have
any capital gain dividends to report (per-share price  drops by the amount paid
out).</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3"><STRONG>Start a Family Business</STRONG></FONT><BR> It doesn't
have to be complex, but it does have to show a profit (in at least 3 out of 5
years,  otherwise the IRS calls it a hobby). Some examples. The Bakers started
Babycakes, Inc. to sell  muffins every Saturday morning at their local farmer's
market. Rose loved going to yard sales on  weekends, so, she started a second
hand furniture business with the objects she found. Uncle Sam  rewards private
enterprise with a greatly reduced expected contribution to college costs. Also 
remember, any money you pay your children becomes a business expense, and under
the Federal  Methodology, students receive an income protection allowance of
$1,750.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Save for Retirement</STRONG><BR> Need analysis wants to know how much
you contribute to a retirement fund the year before college  (it considers this
contribution a discretionary item and adds it back in to your total income). It
does  not, however, ask how much you've already saved. In other words, you can
accumulate money  tax-free (or tax-deferred) at the same time you reduce your
assets for need analysis and save for  your retirement. Please note, however,
that some colleges will ask about the value of your  retirement funds and either
ask you to borrow against them, or use that information &quot;against&quot; you
if  try to negotiate your aid package. Also, you don't want all your assets tied
up in funds that penalize  you for early withdrawal (e.g., before age 59 1/2).
You may need some money sooner.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Extraordinary Expenses</STRONG><BR> Does your family have enormous
medical expenses? Does your family pay private secondary school  tuitions for
younger siblings? Were your parents divorced or separated after you filed your
aid  application? Was your home affected by earthquakes? Floods? The Federal
Methodology no  longer includes allowances for unreimbursed medical expenses,
secondary tuition paid, or  unpleasant events like the ones just mentioned, but
leaves consideration of these special conditions  to the discretion of the
financial aid administrator. Make certain to let the FAA know!</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Strategy 2-Increase the Cost of Attendance</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<STRONG>Objective:</STRONG> Increase the cost of attendance so your need
becomes larger. This technique is most  appropriate for improving your chances
for a Stafford Loan.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Don't Rule Out More Expensive Schools</STRONG><BR> Your EFC is $9,000
and you plan to attend a $10,000 school. The maximum (subsidized) Stafford  for
which you qualify is $1,000. If you now select a $11,500 school, you qualify for
a $2,500 loan.  Your family contribution is the same.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Are All Your Expenses Reflected in the Cost of Attendance?</STRONG><BR>
Does the aid administrator have a true picture of your transportation costs,
special medical  expenses, or other legitimate expenses that may have been
overlooked by the school?  Unfortunately, FAAs cannot include the cost of a new
computer in your cost of attendance  UNLESS the school explicitly requires all
students to own one (many do)! Here, however, is a  situation that can work!
Your family contribution is $5,000 and the FAA has established a $6,000  cost of
attendance for you. The maximum (subsidized) Stafford Loan for which you can
qualify is  $1,000. You now convince the FAA your budget must include $500 for
physical therapy made  necessary by a recent car accident. Your budget now
becomes $6,500 and you qualify for a  $1,500 Stafford Loan.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Strategy 3-Obtain an Improved Aid Package</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Your aid package is loaded with loan money that, one day, you will have to
repay. You don't like  that. <STRONG>Objective:</STRONG> Change the composition
of the aid package to emphasize aid that does not have to  be repaid-grants and
work-study.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Careful College Application</STRONG><BR> In applying to colleges, do
so as early as possible, before the money runs out. Also, pick colleges  where
you are in the top 25% of the applicant pool. The most desirable applicants get
the most  agreeable aid packages. That's as true at the Ivies as it is at Horned
Toad State.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Negotiate with the Financial Aid Administrator</STRONG><BR> This works
only if the college really wants you. What gives you bargaining strength? Good
grades  and SATs, athletic ability, artistic talents, alumni ties, ethnic
background, geographic origin, even a  substantial financial aid package from
one of the school's &quot;competitors.&quot; Colleges like to brag about  the
diversity of the student body and they might be missing a pole vaulter from
Idaho or a soprano  from Rhode Island. Colleges also know they are competing for
warm bodies. You might even ask a  department head (if you are a genius) or a
coach (if you are a jock) to be your advocate in such  negotiations. Why do
colleges care so much about all this? Long term survival! First of all, a
diverse  student body makes for a more rewarding academic experience for all
enrolled students, but also,  having an enthusiastic, diverse group of alumni
spread out over the entire country is a good way for  a college to ensure a
continued stream of applicants in future years. </P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Strategy 4-Replace Your Money With OPM </STRONG></FONT><BR>
<STRONG>Objective: </STRONG>Getting Other People's Money (OPM) to pay for your
family contribution is the most  desirable but also the most difficult strategy.
<EM>The Wall Street Journal</EM> tells the story of an  enterprising,
financially strapped economics student who staged a one-person bike-a-thon to
benefit  himself. Unfortunately, pledges to his scholarship fund ($725) barely
covered his expenses ($510),  and after biking nearly 200 miles, alone and in
the dark, he offered these words of wisdom, &quot;stupid  idea, stupid idea,
stupid idea.&quot; Here are some better ones.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Money from Grandma</STRONG><BR> Direct payments to the school for
tuition are not subject to the $10,000 gift tax limits, so  grandparents who
want to help their smart grandchildren can help pay the college bill, without 
having that generosity affect the financial aid calculation or anyone's tax
return. No fuss. No muss.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Money from Your Boss</STRONG><BR> Many employers will reimburse you
for part of your tuition expenses. See <A HREF="ch12.html">Chapter 12 </A>for
more  information.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>No-Need Awards</STRONG><BR> No-need awards are scholarships given with
no regard to your financial need. If you win a $2,000,  no-need scholarship, you
are $2,000 ahead. The recipient of a no-need scholarship can fall into one  of
two categories with regard to college costs: They either have need or they
don't. Let's examine  each situation in more detail:</P>
<P><BR>
<U>Situation 1</U>-You have need and receive a no-need award<BR> The cost of
college is reduced by the amount of your award. This reduction may eliminate (1)
part  of your need; (2) your entire need; or (3) your entire need and part of
your family contribution.  Actual numbers will determine which of these it will
be. Assume the cost of college is $12,000 and  your family contribution is
$7,000. This makes your need $5,000.<BR>
<EM>Example 1</EM>-Your no-need award is $1,000. Offered aid package: Your need
is reduced from  $5,000 to $4,000; your family contribution remains at $7,000.<BR>
<EM>Example 2</EM>-Your no-need award is $5,000. Offered aid package: Your need
is wiped out; your  family contribution remains $7,000.<BR>
<EM>Example 3</EM>-Your no-need award is $6,000. Offered aid package: Your need
is wiped out; this  time your family contribution is reduced from $7,000 to
$6,000.<BR> This packaging may seem unfair, but colleges have very little
choice about how they use your  no-need award-federal regulations require them
to include the money as part of your family's  expected resources for college
before they can use it to replace any of your EFC. In Examples 1  and 2 above,
students can still benefit greatly from the no-need award by convincing the FAA
to  use the money to replace a loan element of their aid package.</P>
<P><BR>
<U>Situation 2</U>-You have no need and the award is a no-need award<BR> In
this case, the money goes directly to you. It replaces your money. You write a
smaller check  when you pay the college bill. Let's assign numbers to this. Your
family contribution is $9,000 and  the cost of college is $9,000.<BR>
<EM>Example 1</EM>-Your no-need award is $3,000. Your family contribution
shrinks to $6,000. That's all  you have to pay. <BR>
<EM>Example 2</EM>-Your no-need award is $10,000. Now you're $1,000 ahead which
will finance your  winter tour to the Yucatan. Right? Wrong. You can only
receive $9,000-the amount that eliminates  your family contribution. Financial
aid can't exceed the cost of attendance. In other words, it cannot  provide
income for you.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Strategy 5-Lower the Cost of College</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Attempt to lower the cost of college so as to reduce or eliminate your need.
<STRONG>Objective:</STRONG> To avoid  going through the hassle of applying for
aid or saddling yourself with debt following graduation.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Pick a Lower-Priced School</STRONG><BR> Choose a school in an area
where the cost of living is low (e.g., Texas, Michigan) or one that  receives
church subsidies (e.g., Brigham Young, St. Olaf). And most importantly, don't
overlook  your own State U.<BR>
</P>
<P>You might also go to a community college for two years, then transfer to a
four-year school to finish  your degree. You pick up the &quot;halo&quot; of the
prestige college's sheepskin, but at a fraction of the cost.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Examine Each Element that Makes up &quot;Cost of Attendance&quot;</STRONG><BR>
Some are firmly established (such as tuition), but you can influence others. For
example, used  books cost less than new ones, softcover costs less than
hardcover, and many airlines have  incredible student rates! (or you might use
an airline's credit card to pay tuition and use the resulting  frequent flier
miles for free round trips to campus). Students can also save money by living 
off-campus with roommates, or choosing a meal plan that fits their lifestyle
(don't pay for breakfast  at the dining hall if you know you never wake up
before noon).</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Look for Other Savings</STRONG><BR> Parents may qualify for lower car
insurance when their risky teenage driver heads to college. Also,  keep track of
pre-college costs. Campus visits, test prep courses, application fees and
private  counselors can cost thousands. Be judicious.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Accelerate College </STRONG><BR> Take college courses for credit while
in high school or get credit on advanced placement exams.  Last year, 400,000
students took 600,000 tests receiving passing scores (3, 4 or 5) on over half of
 them. About 1200 schools give credit for good AP scores (although many are
boosting their  minimum acceptable score from 3 to 4); hundreds (including
Harvard) grant incoming students  sophomore standing. Each credit hour you pick
up can be worth as much as $400 (depending on  the college's tuition costs). A
test costs only about $75.<BR>
</P>
<P>Another option is the three-year degree. High profile figures from Stanford
and Oberlin have  praised the idea. Others feel most students need the full four
years to grow, intellectually,  emotionally, and occupationally. They're afraid
the liberal-arts will get short-changed as students  won't have enough time to
take the necessary spectrum of courses.<BR>
</P>
<P>But whatever you do, don't take more than four years to graduate!</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Investigate External Degree Programs </STRONG><BR> There are lots of
ways to go to school without setting foot in a classroom. The best summary of 
these external degree programs is <EM>College Degrees by Mail </EM>by John
Bear, $12.95, Ten Speed  Press, PO Box 7123, Berkeley, CA 94707. For example:<BR>
1. <STRONG>Take correspondence courses</STRONG>. Regents College of New York
seems the most  comprehensive, offering 26 associate and baccalaureate degrees.
Students may enroll at any time,  and move through the program at their own
pace. Regents College offers no classes of its own.  Rather, it accepts a wide
array of credit from accredited sources including distance instruction, 
campus-based courses at other colleges and universities, and special assessment.
Regents College  also provides enrolled students with access to its own database
of over 7,000 distance learning  options. Students work with an academic advisor
by mail, phone, fax and e-mail to plan their  course of study. Regents College
serves nearly 20,000 resourceful, independent learners each year.  For program
information, write Regents College, The University of the State of New York,
Dept.  DMO, 7 Columbia Circle, Albany, NY, 12203, 518/464-8500 or visit their
web site at 
<A HREF="http://www.regents.edu">http://www.regents.edu</A>.<BR> 2. <STRONG>Get
your education through public television</STRONG>. Many stations have agreements
with colleges  to offer courses for credit. Mind Extension University lets cable
subscribers get course credit at  home that they may later apply toward degree
programs at participating colleges. Sample courses  include: Analytical Geometry
and Calculus, American Poetry Post-1900, Family Relationships,  Conversational
French, the US Constitution, and Economics (Macro- and Micro- ). Call 
800-777-MIND for tuition and registration information. Warning: Make sure you
check the  accreditation for these programs. Nonaccredited courses will not
count toward a degree. <BR> 3. <STRONG>Graduate from &quot;http://www.almamater.edu&quot;</STRONG>.
Computers, modems, phone lines and virtual  universities are the next wave in
external degrees. For example, the (for-profit) University of  Phoenix has
started advertising its online campus quite heavily. It's fully accredited and
located at 
<A HREF="http://www.uophx.edu/online">http://www.uophx.edu/online</A>. <BR>
</P>
<P>With huge projected increases in the number of college-bound students, many
states are also  considering &quot;electronic institutions&quot; rather than
expanding physical campuses. Twelve Western  governors have discussed working
together to create a virtual university. Florida, Iowa, Kentucky,  Maine,
Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin are also all in the
process  of introducing or expanding state networks to link students and
schools. <BR> 4. <STRONG>Get credit for life experience</STRONG>. Different
schools have their own rules on what counts for what  credit. The American
Council on Education publishes guidelines in <EM>The National Guide to 
Educational Credit for Training Programs</EM>. Another option is to take the
College Board's  College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) Test or the ACT's
Proficiency Examination Program  (PEP).</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Strategy Six-Improve your Cash Flow</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Your family contribution must be paid each semester. For those who have
assembled vast quantities  of worldly goods, the family contribution can
represent a rather sizable sum that usually comes with  a friendly note &quot;unless
this bill is paid by such and such a date your student will not be allowed to 
register for classes...&quot;<BR>
</P>
<P>How can you pay this bill without selling the family home, jeopardizing your
after-retirement financial  security or taking out a high-cost commercial loan?
You could turn to Uncle Sam's loan programs  (the Stafford and PLUS). But
Uncle's loans have some drawbacks. One, they are subject to the  whims of the
political process. And, two, they have the usual comet's tail of paperwork, 
back-and-forth mailings, and other rigmarole generally attached to federal
programs. <STRONG>Objective:</STRONG>  To pay your family contribution without
liquidating assets, hocking the family jewels, or playing  Uncle Sam's paper
games.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Choose Colleges with Innovative Payment Plans</STRONG><BR> Many
colleges offer favorable, middle-income loan programs, using money either from
its own  endowment funds or through money raised by state tax-exempt bond
issues. Other schools allow  you to pay the family contribution in installments.
See <A HREF="ch09.html">Chapter 9</A>. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Participate in Commercial Tuition Payment Plans</STRONG><BR> Here is
how most plans work: You determine your cash requirement for college-say $1,500
at the  start of each semester. The commercial organization forwards that money
to the school twice a  year, then collects ten $300 payments from you spread
evenly over a number of months. You pay  no interest, but must start making your
payments well before your tuition bill is due. Frequently,  plans charge a flat
$40-$50 fee and have a life insurance feature to cover bills in the event of
your  death. Payment plan sponsors include:<BR> * KNIGHT College Resource
Group. 855 Boyleston Street, Boston, MA 02116, 800/225-6783  (or 617/267-1500)<BR>
* Tuition Management Systems. 4 John Clarke Road, Newport, RI 02842,

<P><BR>
<STRONG>Borrow from a Commercial Loan Source</STRONG><BR> With the growing
threat to interest subsidies in federal loan programs, expect these plans to
multiply  over the next few years. But be sure to compare plans before you sign
on any dotted lines. Finance  charges can vary greatly, as can the repayment
schedules. Here are five of the largest commercial  loan sources:<BR> * TERI
offers loans of up to the total cost of education (less any financial aid
received) with 20-25  years to repay. Repayment begins 45 days after loan
disbursement, although families may defer  paying back the principal while the
student is enrolled. Families also pay a guarantee fee equal to  5% of the total
loan amount. The interest rate equals the prime rate plus 1-2%. TERI also
sponsors  the Professional Education Plan (PEP) for graduate students. Contact
The Education Resource  Institute, 330 Stuart Street, Suite 500, Boston, MA
02116, 1-800-255-TERI. <BR> * NELLIE MAE. The New England Loan Marketing
Association offers similar loans (EXCEL.  GradEXCEL and SHARE). For more
information, write Nellie Mae, 50 Braintree Hill Park, Suite  300, Braintree, MA
02184, 800-634-9308 (in MA, 617-849-1325).<BR> * SALLIE MAE. The Student Loan
Marketing Association offers a wide variety of programs for  both graduate and
undergraduate students. Its Signature Education Loan Program combines  Stafford
loans with private supplemental loans, providing students and their families
with a  comprehensive source of education loan funding throughout the student's
college career. For more  information, contact SALLIE MAE, 1050 Thomas Jefferson
Street, NW, Washington, DC 20007,  800-828-0290.<BR> * GATE. Guaranteed Access
to Education. Loan limits are set by participating schools. No  origination or
guarantee fees. No payments during full-time enrollment (interest, however,
accrues).  Repayment begins four months after graduation. Payments are
interest-only for the first five years,  followed by eight years of increasing
payments of principal and interest. Contact GATE, 7 Tucker's  Wharf, Marblehead,
MA 01945, 800-895-GATE.<BR> * PLATO. Loans of up to $25,000 per year with 15
years to repay. Use funds for all  education-related expenses, even $3,000 for a
personal computer. Repayment begins 30 days after  the student receives the loan
money (although families may defer repaying the principal for up to  four years
while the student is enrolled). Contact PLATO, 205 Van Buren St. #200, Herndon,
VA  22070, 800-GO-PLATO.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Tap Your Home Equity </STRONG><BR> If your family has a good credit
history, you can generally borrow up to 80% of the market value of  your home
minus the outstanding balance of your mortgage. In other words, if you own a
$100,000  home and have $30,000 left on the mortgage, you can borrow up to
$50,000. Calculation:  (100,000 x .8)-30,000=$50,000. You must usually pay a
small fee to open an account, but after  that, you can borrow whatever you need,
whenever you need it, without having to reapply. To use  the funds, you simply
write a check or use a credit card. Interest rates float about two percentage 
points above the prime. And here's an added bonus. Any items you charge against
your credit  line-like college tuition-will become part of your home mortgage,
so, your interest payments on  loans up to $100,000 become tax-deductible.<BR>
</P>
<P>Home equity loans are an extremely easy and flexible way to obtain cash flow
assistance on  favorable terms. In fact, they allow many families to live way
beyond their means, so take care that  ease of access to all this money does not
result in deep financial problems and cause you to lose  your home. The total
monthly payments on all of your loans should not exceed 35% of your pre-tax 
monthly income. Also make certain you choose a line of credit over a loan. The
reason? You won't  need all the money at once. In fact, in between tuition bills
you should pay down as much of your  debt as possible, so you never use up more
of your equity than necessary. <BR>
</P>
<P>When shopping for the best deal, beware of teaser rates. They're usually
only good for the first six  months or a year. Here are some other questions to
ask: What is the rate of interest? If it's variable,  how often can the rate
change? On what index is it based? Does it carry a cap? Is there an annual  fee?
An application fee? An origination fee? Can any of the terms change without my
approval? Are  there any points charged? What about closing costs? Under what
circumstances can the bank  require repayment of the outstanding credit?</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Borrow Against Your 401(k) </STRONG><BR> If you participate in a
company pension plan like a 401(k), you may be able to borrow against it.  Or,
if you are a self-employed professional with a retirement plan, you can do some
borrowing.  Under tax reform, you can borrow half the vested amount up to
$50,000, less your highest loan  balance during the preceding twelve months. The
interest rate hovers around the prime, you pay no  fees or points, and the cash
is available very quickly. To avoid tax and penalties you must repay  your
account within five years (you have longer if the money is used to buy a home).
Payments are  usually made via payroll deductions. If you decide to use this
option, make certain to borrow  enough to cover a full year's tuition, not just
a semester, since employers may impose additional  regulations, such as only one
loan per year. If at all possible, however, consider borrowing from  some other
source. Raids on your 401(k) will cause your fund to grow at a much slower pace,
and  if you're like most parents, you really do need this money for your
retirement.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Use Your IRA</STRONG><BR> You'll probably be hit with a 10% penalty
and a bill from the IRS, so, if you need $6,000, draw out  a little extra to
take care of both the bursar and Uncle Sam. As usual, there's an exception. This
 time it's found in Section 72(t)(2)(A)(iv) of the tax code (or thereabouts).
You can escape the tax  collector and withdraw funds before you turn 59 1/2,
provided you receive the money in equal,  periodic payments extending over the
rest of your years. You can even modify these payments-  after the later of five
years or turning 59 1/2.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>&quot;What If&quot; Calculations</STRONG><BR> Now that you've mastered
the advanced course in need analysis and cash flow, you should try a  few &quot;what
if&quot; situations, using the worksheets in the Appendices. <BR>
<EM>Here Are a Few &quot;What-if&quot; Suggestions</EM><BR> 1. How does a
charitable gift of $1,000 impact on your family contribution?<BR> 2. Should Mom
get a job to help with college costs? Or, should Mom quit her job to increase 
eligibility for financial aid?<BR> 3. If Dad needs to complete his degree, is
there any advantage to his returning to school at the same  time one or more
children are in college?<BR> 4. If you have two children, one year apart, with
one starting college and one starting the senior year  in high school, would it
be advantageous for the older child to &quot;stop out&quot; for one year and
wait for  son or daughter #2 to catch up?<BR> 5. Do grandparents need some
extra money? You can each give each of your student's  grandparents a gift of up
to $10,000. That could reduce your assets by as much as $80,000. It  could also
reduce the amount of tax being paid, as frequently, grandparents are retired and
in a  lower tax bracket.<BR> 6. Can you shift some assets into a business
venture?<BR> 7. Can you lower your AGI to under $50,000?<BR> 8. What happens
if you make a large purchase, such as a car, and pay cash or borrow against a 
stock portfolio?<BR> 9. What happens if you pay down your mortgage?<BR> 10.
Try some &quot;what-ifs&quot; of your own.<BR>

You've seen them. Charts that tell you to save $800 a month from now until your
newborn turns 18  if you want to afford college in the year 2014 (to say nothing
of the savings requirements for families  with two or three children). You are
best advised to ignore these charts and any other  &quot;scare-the-pants-off-you&quot;
marketing strategy employed by organizations who, of course, will be  pleased to
help you save (and invest) that $800 per month. Instead, you should save as much
 money as you can afford, do it systematically, but be realistic, and remember,
when your student  enters college, your savings can be supplemented by a
contribution from your earnings, their  earnings and a manageable loan. If you
feel you absolutely must use one of those &quot;How Much You'll  Need to Save&quot;
charts-a better goal might be to save enough to cover half the cost of college
(also  remember, you don't have to have the entire amount saved by the time your
student first enrolls. He  or she will be there for at least four years...make
certain this expanded time frame is reflected in the  chart's numbers). </P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>How Your Savings Grow</STRONG></FONT><BR> The chart
below shows how your college fund grows if you're stashing away $100 per month.
In  the short run, the rate of return seems to make very little difference. Over
20 years, however, the  difference between 7% and 12% comes to $47,510. Lesson:
Start saving early. Take a chance on  riskier investments. Let compound interest
work for you. Switch to safe investments when college  bills loom near.<BR>

<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Rule of 72</STRONG></FONT><BR> For novice investors,
the Rule of 72 is a quick way to see how fast your money will grow. If you 
divide 72 by your investment's expected rate of return, the resulting answer is
the length of time it  will take for your money to double. For example, your
$10,000 investment is earning 6%. In twelve  years (72/6) it will be worth
$20,000. At 8%, your $10,000 will equal $20,000 in just nine years.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Tax Planning vs. College Aid</STRONG></FONT><BR> When
college is still years away, the name of the game is to accumulate enough money
to help with  the inevitable bills. Unfortunately, plans to minimize tax
liability sometimes run counter to plans to  maximize financial aid
eligibility-making decisions about saving money more complex. The trick is 
knowing when tax planning and college planning run counter to each other, and
when they are  complementary.<BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>Example 1</EM>: The first decision a family must make is whether to
save money in the parents' or the  child's name. For tax purposes, unearned
income derived from parental assets can be assessed at a  higher rate than
unearned income from a child's assets. (For children under 14, the first $650 in
 interest or dividend income is tax-free. The next $650 is taxed at the child's
rate. And any unearned  income in excess of $1,300 is taxed at the parents's
rate.) For financial aid purposes, however,  parental assets are assessed at no
more than 5.6% while student assets are assessed at a flat 35%.  This often
wipes out all the tax advantages previously received. The lesson? If there's any
chance  the family will qualify for financial aid, save in the parents's name.<BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>Example 2</EM>: In saving for retirement, you don't pay taxes on the
money you contribute to 401 (k)s,  403 (b)s, Keoghs, or SEP-IRAs. Furthermore,
your money grows tax-deferred year after year.  For financial aid purposes, the
money you have saved in retirement accounts is excluded from need  analysis,
making saving for retirement one of the most effective ways to also lower your
expected  family contribution.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Getting Good Financial Advice</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Where do you go to get good advice on maximizing savings, both for college and
for retirement?  Most people can get all the information they need from
consumer-oriented personal finance  magazines like <EM>Kiplinger's</EM>, <EM>Money</EM>,
<EM>Smart Money</EM>, <EM>Worth</EM>, <EM>Fortune</EM>, and <EM>Forbes</EM>.
Other people  rely on a stockbroker for advice about the marketplace, an
accountant for tax strategies, and an  attorney for the latest on trusts and
estates. Between these three groups of professionals, families  can get a lot of
sound advice on financial planning. There is, however, an emerging group of 
professionals who can combine the advice you get from your broker, your
accountant and your  lawyer-that is the certified financial planner. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Financial Planners to the Rescue</STRONG><BR> Personal finance experts
appear under many guises-stockbrokers, financial planners, bankers, 
accountants, and insurance agents. Most of these people are bright, resourceful
professionals who  can be of genuine help in the college financing process.
Unfortunately, some of them are good at  planning only one thing-their own
lucrative retirement. Before you enlist in any of their services, learn 
something about investing, write down your objectives, and ask questions. </P>
<P><BR>
<EM>Are they fee only planners or do they work on commission? About how much
are you going  to pay for their services? </EM>Fee only planners charge by the
hour. While this may cost you more  money in the short-run, fee only planners
point out that their counterparts don't always have real  incentives to provide
you with totally unbiased service (i.e., some planners will give you nothing but
 a glossy sales pitch for whatever products bring the largest commission). If
possible, find out how  much of the planner's income comes from each of four
sources: commissions, fees you pay for  advice, fees you pay for them to manage
your funds, and fees they receive from companies that pay  them to sell their
products. And don't confuse fee-only planners with fee-based planners who 
charge both fees AND commissions.<BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>What are their fields of expertise? Their investment strategies? Are
they selling you  boilerplate from a parent company or is truly a personalized
plan?</EM> Your planner should be  familiar with investment strategies of all
types-traditional advice on retirement planning and estate  planning is not
necessarily compatible with sound college planning. Your advisor should be able
to  explain these possible conflicts and help you maximize all of your resources
(while minimizing your  tax consequences). And, your planner should be a good
listener, keeping your comfort level in mind  while helping you with your
financial plan. <BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>What is their prior work experience?</EM> Did they get their start in
law? Accounting? Insurance? A  brokerage house? A college financial aid office?
Charm school? How long have they been in  business? How many clients do they
have? How many new clients per year? Unless it's a firm  specializing in
short-term college planning, heavy turnover is a bad sign! <BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>What are their professional credentials?</EM> Do they still have ties
to an insurance company or  brokerage house? Are they with an established
company such as American Express or Waddell &amp;  Reed? Have they been
certified by a reputable group such as The Institute of Certified Financial 
Planners?<BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>Is the planner providing you with a service you can't get from your
accountant, your  stockbroker or your lawyer?</EM> There is no sense in paying
for the same service twice. <BR>
<STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Finally, ask for references</STRONG>. Reputable planners will be
only too happy to oblige. Most will be  registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission as investment advisors. You can ask the  planner for a copy
of the forms they filed (Form ADV), or request the information directly from the
 SEC (Branch of Public Reference, Office of Filings and Information Services,
450 Fifth Street, Mail  Stop 1-2 NW, Washington DC, 20549, 202/942-8090,
<A HREF="http://www.sec.gov">http://www.sec.gov</A>). Include your  daytime
phone number, state your specific request and indicate your willingness to pay
for copying  and shipping, and for about a quarter a page, the SEC will tell you
all about the planner's academic,  professional and work history. </P>

<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Savings Philosophies</STRONG></FONT><BR> Ask ten
financial advisors to recommend the best way to save for college and you're
likely to get  ten very different answers. First, you must decide how the money
should be saved-in the parents'  name? the child's name? a trust? Then you must
decide how much risk you're willing to take with  your money.<BR>
</P>
<P>It's very difficult to offer sound investment advice in a vacuum, i.e.,
without knowing how much risk  a family is comfortable with taking. As a general
rule, the safer the investment option, the lower the  return. The riskier the
option, the greater the return (as well as the potential for a huge loss). Most 
of the plans described in this chapter are safe, or as some would say, plain
vanilla, and don't require  professional fund managers to turn a profit.<BR>
</P>
<P><EM>How can you tell if your portfolio is too risky?</EM> If you
consistently wake up in the middle of the  night concerned about a price drop in
your stock or bond fund, you should rethink the composition  of your portfolio.<BR>
</P>
<P><EM>How else can you tell if an investment is right for you? </EM>If you
don't understand the investment,  its liquidity, its true costs, or how it
works, then stay away.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Sample Portfolios</STRONG></FONT><BR> The composition
of your portfolio should change with the age of your children. When they are 
young, you can afford to take more risks than you can when tuition bills are
just around the corner.  Here's one example:<BR>
<STRONG>The Early Years (Under 6)</STRONG>. About 90% of your money should be
in stock funds, split between  aggressive growth (the most risky) and growth and
income (less risky). The other 10% should be in  something safe like a money
market or CD.<BR>
<STRONG>The Middle Years (6 to 13)</STRONG>. You should keep about 90% in stock
funds, but shift the money out  of aggressive growth and into more conservative
growth and income.<BR>
<STRONG>The Pre-College Years (14 to 17)</STRONG>. According to personal
finance expert Jane Bryant Quinn,  money you'll need within four years shouldn't
be invested in a mutual fund, because historically,  that's how long it takes
for stocks to drop from a peak and rise back to the original price. Our  advice?
During these years, aim to keep 50% of your money in a growth and income fund,
and start  moving the rest (over the next four years) into CDs or a money
market. <BR> If you don't think you're going to qualify for financial aid, this
is also the time to consider switching  money from your name into your child's.
If you transfer appreciated stock funds into your child's  account before you
convert them into safer investments, the profit will be taxed at the child's
lower  rate (probably 15%), and save you thousands of dollars.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Pay Yourself First</STRONG></FONT><BR> The best way to
accumulate money is to pay yourself first, and use an investment strategy called
 Dollar-Cost-Averaging. The premise is simple. You have a fixed amount of money
withheld from  your paycheck each month and invest that money in something like
a mutual fund; you don't have to  worry about whether the market is up or down,
and you're pretty certain to be safe from financial  disaster. In fact, you'll
probably do better than most professional fund managers. Why does this  work?
Let's say you have $200 withheld from your paycheck and wired into a brokerage
account  each month where it buys shares of your favorite mutual fund. When the
market is up, your $200  buys relatively fewer shares than when the market is
low, so the average cost of your shares is  lower than the average price during
the period.</P>
<PRE>	Monthly		Price per	Shares
	Investment	Share		Purchased
	$200		$25		8.00
	$200		$25		8.00
	$200		$30		6.66
	$200		$25		8.00
	$200		$20		10.00
	$200		$25		8.00
Totals	$1,200		$150		48.66	
</PRE>
<P>Your average cost per share is $24.66 ($1,200/48.66) while the average
market price per share is  $25 ($150/6). You win! Here's another way to look at
your smart investment: Had you simply  purchased 8 shares each month, you would
have only 48 shares for your $1,200. Now you have  48.66. You win again! This
method of regular, systematic savings will allow you to accumulate  funds fast,
especially if you start when your children are very young! </P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Custodial Accounts and Trusts</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Families that want to save money in the child's name have two main
choices-custodial accounts and  trusts.<BR>
<STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Custodial Accounts</STRONG> under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act
(UGMA) accept money. Custodial  accounts under the Uniform Transfer to Minors
Act (UTMA) also accept property. Both are  irrevocable gifts to a child where a
custodian is responsible for managing the funds until the minor  reaches the age
of majority. The money which accumulates does so under the minor's lower tax 
liability. UGMA and UTMA accounts are easy to set up (just call your banker or
broker), but they  have one major drawback. Once the funds are turned over (as
early as age 18), the child can do  whatever he or she wants with them. Pay for
college, pay for a new car, pay for a lifetime supply of  jelly
donuts...Individuals may make a tax-free gift worth up to $10,000 to either of
these two  accounts<BR>
<STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Minority Trust</STRONG>. Under section 2503(c) of the tax code,
families can establish an inter-vivos (living)  trust for a minor, provided the
funds are used solely for the benefit of that minor. This trust has one  main
advantage over a UGMA. The trustee has control over the funds until the &quot;donee&quot;
is 21 years  old-well into the college paying years<BR>
<STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Crummey Trust</STRONG>. Named for the court case under which it
originated, this is very similar to the  2503(c) trust described above, but with
one important exception. The recipient of the trust  (presumably your child) may
withdraw any contributions made to the trust in that year. If your child  makes
no withdrawals, the contribution is added to the principal (and if your child
does something  stupid with the money, you can stop adding to the trust). The
trust may continue as long as the  trustee chooses. <BR>
</P>
<P>Individuals may also each make a tax-free gift of up to $10,000 to either of
these two trusts. The  drawbacks? You'll need an attorney, and as much as $2,500
in attorney fees to set up a trust and,  you'll have to file separate income tax
returns for them. Worst of all, recent tax law changes resulted  in trust income
being taxed far more heavily than individual income. The idea was to nab the
rich.  Unfortunately, many of the affected trusts are those set up to care for
the disabled or to pay for  college. Unless there's a change, the first $1,600
in trust income is taxed at 15%; the next $2,200 is  taxed at 28%; the next
$2,000 is taxed at 31%, the next $2,100 at 36% and anything above  $7,900 is
taxed at 39.6%.<BR>
<STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Charitable Remainder Unitrust</STRONG>. You donate a set amount of
money (usually at least $50,000) to  a college or a charitable institution, such
as your alma mater or local art museum, but stipulate that  from 5% to 10% of
the value of the gift, be paid out each year as income to a fund for your 
college-bound student. At the end of a designated time frame, the principal goes
to the college or  charity. Meanwhile, you, the donor (1) receive a substantial
tax deduction (2) build a college fund  for junior and (3) give money to a
favored charity. Many people choose to donate an appreciated  asset for the
trust to sell, because that way they avoid paying tax on the appreciation, yet
they get to  deduct the full market value of the item. You'll need professional
help to set up such a trust.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>CDs and T-bills</STRONG></FONT><BR> Some of the
safest, and easiest ways for parents to save money are through short- and
long-term  Certificates of Deposit, Treasury bills (which mature in 13, 26 or 52
weeks), Treasury notes (which  mature in 1 to 10 years), Treasury bonds (which
mature in 10 to 30 years), and US savings bonds.  As you shop around for rates,
remember brokerage firms can usually get you the highest rates on  CDs and
money-market funds. In August, 1996, you could get six-month CDs that yield
5.76%,  five-year CDs that yield 6.87%, three-month Treasury bills at 5.29%,
one-year bills at 5.83%,  two-year Treasury notes at 6.28%, five-year notes at
6.71%, ten-year notes at 6.93%, and  30-year Treasury bonds at 7.1%. Treasuries
are exempt from state and local taxes, so for most  families, these yields are
even higher.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>EE Savings Bonds</STRONG></FONT><BR> Parents who have
purchased EE savings bonds will not have to pay tax on the interest that
accrues,  provided the bonds are used to pay for their children's education.
Full benefits are available to  couples with incomes of $65,250 or less and to
single parents with incomes of $43,500 or less  when it's time to redeem their
bonds. The exemption tapers off for families with incomes above  these limits,
and disappears completely for couples with incomes above $95,250 and single
parents  with incomes above $58,500. Income limitations will be indexed for
inflation, so, by the time you  redeem your bonds, the income ceilings may be
much higher. One Catch: Your income for the year  in which you plan to redeem
your bonds includes all the interest the bonds have earned! This  additional
income may push some families right past the income cut-offs and ironically
eliminate their  exclusion! Bonds may be purchased at any time during the year,
but the purchasers must be at least  24 years of age. In other words, families
with incomes too high to benefit from the tax break may  not have their children
take advantage of the benefit by buying the bonds themselves. For the same 
reason, grandparents and couples who file separate tax returns are also
ineligible to participate. If  you mistakenly bought the bonds in your child's
name, you can plead your case by filing a reissue  form (PD F 4000) with the
Bureau of Public Debt, Savings Bond Operations Office, 200 Third  Street,
Parkersburg, WV 26106-1328.<BR>
</P>
<P>EE Bonds no longer carry a guaranteed minimum interest rate. Instead, the
interest rate for bonds  held less than five years equals 85% of six-month
T-bills; the interest rate for bonds held longer than  five years equals 85% of
five-year Treasury bonds. Rates are adjusted twice a year (May 1 and  November
1). For current rates, call 800-4US BOND. <BR>
</P>
<P>Note: Interest on EE bonds is posted just twice a year, so time your
redemptions carefully  otherwise you could lose out on as much as six-month's
worth of interest. Bonds are available  through payroll deductions and at most
banks and credit unions. For more information, get a copy  of <EM>The Savings
Bond Question and Answer Book and Questions and Answers About  Education Savings
Bonds</EM> from the Department of Treasury, US Savings Bonds Division, 
Washington, DC 20226. </P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Inflation Bonds</STRONG></FONT><BR> For people who
worry about the impact of inflation on the value of their bonds, Uncle Sam has 
introduced a new product, bonds which have yields pegged to the inflation rate.
Details are still  being finalized, but they will probably be sold as ten-year
notes and 30-year bonds, and be  available in denominations as low as $1,000.
Are they a good idea? Yes, if inflation rises. No, if  inflation declines. Your
guess is as good as ours. </P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Mutual Funds</STRONG></FONT><BR> The best way for
small investors to play the market is via a mutual fund. By having your money 
pooled with money from lots of other investors, you gain the advantage of
diversification and  professional fund management. Mutual funds are usually
categorized by their investment goals. For  example, <EM>Growth Funds</EM> aim
to increase the value of your investment rather than provide you with  a large
stream of dividends. Growth Funds generally invest in stocks and are best suited
for people  who plan to hold on to the fund for a longer period of time, for
example, people who won't need to  tap their college fund for many years. <EM>Income
Funds</EM> focus on providing investors with high current  income (i.e., large
dividends). Income funds generally invest in corporate and government bonds, or 
stocks with good dividend-paying records. They bring higher yields than money
market funds, but  their share price can move up or down, making them a little
riskier. <EM>Money Market Funds</EM> are very  safe, and accordingly, offer the
investor the lowest return. Money Market Funds generally invest in  high quality
securities with short maturities (e.g., bank CDs, US Treasury bills). Other
types of funds  include hybrids of the above, for example, Aggressive Growth,
Balanced Growth, and Growth and  Income. Investors will also find specialty
funds grouped by company type (for example, energy,  environmental, health care,
real estate, utilities, etc.). <BR>
</P>
<P>You can either buy funds yourself (using data from the Institute, the <EM>Wall
Street Journal</EM>, or  magazines like <EM>Smart Money</EM>, <EM>Kiplinger's</EM>
and <EM>Money</EM>) or, work with a broker. You can even buy  &quot;Life-Cycle
Funds&quot; which are pre-fabbed allocation pies sold by mutual fund companies;
there's a  pie for every investment goal.<BR>
</P>
<P>This tip from the <EM>WSJ</EM>: To simplify your taxes, set up four
separate funds. Then, to cover each year's  college expenses, sell one fund.
Also remember, as students approach college age, families should  lower their
investment risk by shifting the balance of their savings from aggressive growth
funds to  growth and income funds, and finally, to money market funds.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Zero Coupon Bonds</STRONG></FONT><BR> These are
municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and treasury bonds stripped of their interest
coupons.  Owners receive no income while holding the bonds. Instead, the income
is compounded  semi-annually and reinvested. At some future date, you receive a
fixed sum that is considerably  larger than your purchase price. For example, a
7.4% zero maturing in 2005, will cost you $486  per thousand, which means you
pay $4,860 today to get $10,000 ten years from now. A $10,000  bond maturing in
twenty years will cost you only $2,015. <BR>
</P>
<P>Many families like to use zero coupon bonds to save for college expenses
because they can time the  maturity dates to coincide with their students'
tuition bills. Also, they know exactly how much money  they will receive when
those tuition bills come due, a certainty that for some families is more 
important than taking chances with a riskier portfolio. There are, however,
several drawbacks to  zeros, which families should consider before deciding on
this type of long-term monetary  investment.<BR>
</P>
<P>Corporate bonds and municipal bonds may be called before they reach
maturity, and if you miss the  call, you may be in for a nasty surprise when you
go to claim your money. Here's why. When a  bond is called (usually because of
declining interest rates) interest stops accumulating, and its value  freezes.
The $10,000 face value you thought you were getting could turn out to be little
more than  the bond's original cost. Treasury bonds are much safer, as they
carry a no-call provision.<BR>
</P>
<P>Even though no income is distributed, tax must be paid yearly on the accrued
interest. The  exception is for zero-coupon municipals which are tax free (but
somewhat rare).<BR>
</P>
<P>There is no way of knowing what the value of the money will be when the bond
matures. If interest  rates rise, the value of the bond drops. If interest rates
drop, the value of the bond rises. As a rule,  corporate bonds have the highest
yield, but also the highest risk.<BR>
</P>
<P>Will the bond's issuer will be around in 20 years to pay off the amount due?
To be safe, avoid  bonds issued by small municipalities and corporate bonds with
risky ratings (AAA is good, DDD is  not). To be extra safe, buy
government-backed Treasury zeros.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Prepaid Tuition Plans</STRONG></FONT><BR> While
sophisticated investors can earn greater returns on their own than they can with
prepaid  tuition plans, the fact is, most families are not comfortable playing
investment games. They want an  easy way to guarantee they'll have enough money
for their children's education, and many families  are happy to sacrifice a
percentage point or two of interest to buy that security. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>State Plans</STRONG><BR> To encourage early planning for college
costs, many states sponsor &quot;Prepaid Tuition Plans&quot; in which  parents
can guarantee four years of tuition at any of the state's public (or in some
cases, private)  colleges by making a lump sum investment or periodic payments.
(FL allows participants to use the  money at any college in the country while MA
allows anyone in the country to invest in MA). No  two plans are the same, but
most operate under the same assumptions: The investment amount  depends on the
child's date of entry into college, the percentage of costs the family wants to
cover,  and the degree of flexibility parents desire in withdrawing funds. The
state invests the money and  pays the student's tuition when he or she enters
college, and takes the risk of actually guaranteeing  tuition. Families pay tax
on the appreciation when they redeem the money for college. As for the  interim
tax consequences, after a recent court ruling that investment gains inside
Michigan's plan  could not be taxed, the IRS has dropped the issue. This is good
news for all the states that had  passed enabling legislation, but were waiting
for a definitive tax ruling before starting their program.  See
<A HREF="ch11.html">Chapter 11</A> for a state listing and more information.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>The College Savings Bank</STRONG><BR>
<EM>The College Savings Bank</EM> in Princeton offers a similar type of tuition
guarantee. The Bank sells  CDs based on the average cost of 500 independent
colleges. The interest rate is 1.5% lower than  the average annual tuition
increase at these colleges. In other words, if the index rises by 7.61%, the 
interest rate is 6.11%. Your upfront premium reduces the effective rate of your
investment a  percentage or so more, making the actual yield not much higher
than most passbook savings  accounts. Participants in this plan also face steep
penalties for early withdrawal; 10% of principal  during the first three years,
5% thereafter. For more information on CollegeSure CDs, call  1-800-888-2723,
<A HREF="http://www.collegesavings.com">http://www.collegesavings.com</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>In Whose Name-Parent or Child?</STRONG></FONT><BR> As
we mentioned earlier, the critical decision you must make in any long-range
capital accumulation  plan is whether the plan will be in your name, at your tax
rate, or in the child's name, at the child's  tax rate. The money will grow more
quickly in the child's name because of the lower tax bracket.  But when it comes
time to pay tuition bills, the child's money is subject to a much heavier 
assessment. Colleges will demand 35% of the child's assets each year, but only
5.6% of parental  assets.<BR>
</P>
<P>Let's attach some numbers. A family in the 35% bracket (this includes an
allowance for state taxes)  elects to make a yearly gift of $1,000 to a child,
starting at birth. The money is invested at 8%. At  the end of eighteen years,
the kitty will be worth $34,892. Had the family added $1,000 per year to  a
parental account, also invested at 8%, the money, under higher taxation, would
have grown to  only $28,662.<BR>
</P>
<P>Now it's need analysis/family contribution time. For each of the next four
years, the student's kitty is  depleted by 35% of its value. The parental kitty,
on the other hand, is depleted by only 5.6%. At  the end of four years, the
child's kitty has shrunk by $28,664 to $6,228. The parental kitty has  shrunk by
only $5,904 and is still a respectable $22,758.<BR>
</P>
<P>So what should you do?	<BR>
</P>
<P>If there is no chance your family will qualify for aid, save in the child's
name, the money will  accumulate more quickly. To take advantage of the fact
that unearned income of children over 14 is  still taxed at the child's rate, if
you have young children, your gifts should take the form of  tax-deferred
investments, such as US Savings Bonds and fast growing stocks. Once the child 
reaches 14, redeem the bonds, sell the stocks, and place the proceeds in a safe,
but high yielding  investment. Then spend it all on tuition.<BR>
</P>
<P>If there is any chance for getting aid, save in the parent's name, make the
smaller family contribution,  and pad your college expenditures with need based
aid.<BR>
</P>
<P>Predicting aid eligibility is no easy task. Constantly changing tax laws and
student assistance laws  confuse professionals, to say nothing of those whose
jobs do not depend on keeping up with  Congressional activity. Here's what we
advise. Assume the ratio between present earnings and  assets and present
college costs will hold for the future. Run your family through the Federal 
Methodology in <A HREF="app1.html">Appendix 1</A>. Compare the estimated family
contribution with the current costs of  colleges of interest. If your family
contribution is less than the cost of college today, you may qualify  for aid in
the future. Remember to divide the parental contribution by the number you will
have in  college at least half-time at any one time.</P>

<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Rethinking Your Ideas About Admission</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Unless you plan to attend one of the few highly selective colleges, banish the
thought that it's hard to  get into college. It's easy. Over 92% of all students
are accepted by their first or second choice  school. In the old days, you
applied to five or six schools; one or two where your odds were  fifty-fifty, a
couple where you had the edge, and a safety school that was sure to take you.
Today  your selection strategy needs to be based on factors other than the
possibility of rejection. First and  foremost you should consider quality of
education and your fit with each school, but then you should  consider its
financial aid offerings. Look for:<BR> 1. Schools with innovative payment
plans. These can ease cash flow problems.<BR> 2. Schools with innovative aid
programs. These can funnel money toward &quot;desirable&quot; students.<BR> 3.
Schools with mountains of cash. These can usually handle your &quot;need.&quot;<BR>
4. Schools with a reputation for leadership in your selected field of study.
They are likely to be  well-endowed in your field.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Financial Aid in the Admission Process</STRONG></FONT><BR>
If students can't afford the school, they aren't going to enroll! This simple
truth means that at many  schools, the line between financial aid and admission
is beginning to disappear. New experiments in  &quot;enrollment management&quot;
and the intense competition for quality students translate into &quot;no-need&quot;
 awards and &quot;preferential packaging.&quot; In other words, aid
administrators are being pressured to  reassess family contributions and the
contents of aid packages for certain students to help the school  meet
enrollment goals. At most schools, however, aid resources are limited so the
first people in line  are still more likely to have their need met than the
last. Given these words of wisdom, it's up to you  to take action.<BR>
</P>
<P>1. Apply &quot;early decision&quot; for both admission and financial
aid-that way you should have all your  need met.<BR> 2. Apply to colleges where
your qualifications place you in the upper 25% of the applicant pool.  That
standing will have a significant impact on the composition of your aid package.
Schools make  no bones about that. <BR> 3. Always pair your applications. For
better &quot;leverage,&quot; apply to two four-star schools; and two  three-star
schools; not just one of each. This may increase your application fees, however,
when  you receive acceptances from schools of similar prestige, you may be able
to use that to improve  your aid package. A school may not mind losing you to a
lesser or higher regarded college. But it  will fight to keep you from going to
a competitor.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>It Doesn't Hurt To Ask</STRONG></FONT><BR> The
financial aid sections of college catalogues are often very vague. Why do
schools do this? First  of all, vagueness about financial aid is important when
you know Uncle Sam will release some  enormous rule change two days after
500,000 copies of your school's materials come back from  the printer. Second,
it's hard to be precise about what kinds of aid a student might expect when 
financial aid decisions vary from student to student depending on the their
income and asset situation  and their admission qualifications. And third, the &quot;you
may be a grand prize winner&quot; attitude is  essential for colleges trying to
convince students not to worry about the $25,000 bill they'll face if  they
enroll! While it's true that aid packages at many schools are quite generous,
frequently, that  generosity takes the form of loans, which you must repay.
<BR>
</P>
<P>To cut through the rhetoric, you will have to ask specific questions. Don't
be bashful. You have the  right to ask colleges as many questions as they ask
you. Find out about innovative payment plans of  the type illustrated in the
next two sections. And get answers to the following:<BR>
</P>
<P>1. Do you guarantee to meet a student's financial need (or a certain
percentage of a student's need)? 
<EM>Reason</EM>: Under the Federal Methodology, many more families are eligible
for financial aid.  Unfortunately, additional federal money has not been
appropriated to help all these newly eligible  families.<BR> 2. Do you have a
per-student-limit on the aid you provide?<EM> Reason</EM>: Some schools set
ceilings, such  as a $10,000 per student maximum.<BR> 3. Do I have to
demonstrate a minimum amount of need to qualify for aid? <EM>Reason</EM>: Some
schools  won't consider students for aid unless they have at least $500 need.<BR>
4. Do you have a standard &quot;unmet need&quot; figure for each aid recipient?
<EM>Reason</EM>: Some schools will,  automatically, leave each aid recipient
$500 short.<BR> 5. What is your expected &quot;student earnings&quot; figure?
<EM>Reason</EM>: Regardless of the results of need  analysis, some colleges
expect a certain amount (which can be as high as $1,700 per year). The  colleges
will expect that amount, whether it comes from the student's contribution or the
parents'  contribution.<BR> 6. Is there an application cut-off date for
guaranteeing a student's unmet need? <EM>Reason</EM>: Some  colleges say they
can meet all need for students whose applications are received prior to Date X. 
But no such guarantee extends to students who apply after that.<BR> 7. Do you
maintain financial aid &quot;waiting lists&quot; or accept students on an &quot;admit-deny&quot;
basis? <EM>Reason</EM>:  These practices mean financially needy students are
welcome but they will not receive financial aid.<BR> 8. If I don't apply for
aid in my freshman year, can I apply in subsequent years? <EM>Reason</EM>: You
can't  be prohibited from applying, however, you may get nothing because many
colleges give priority to  &quot;continuing recipients.&quot;<BR> 9. How are &quot;outside
scholarships&quot; packaged? <EM>Reason</EM>: Different colleges have different
&quot;aid  philosophies.&quot; Some schools will use the outside scholarship to
replace a loan. At other colleges, the  outside scholarship merely replaces, on
a dollar for dollar basis, collegiate grants. The Lesson?  Search for a policy
that permits &quot;outside scholarships&quot; to replace at least part of the
package's  self-help component (loans and work-study).<BR> 10. What percentage
of alumni contribute to the school's annual fundraising campaign? <EM>Reason</EM>:
If  you are worried about the college's financial survival, you can't ask for a
corporate balance sheet.  But you can check with the college's development
office to learn whether the school has strong  alumni support. At some schools,
it's as high as 65% and when colleges have this kind of loyalty,  they are not
going to fold.</P>

<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Fifteen Innovative Payment Plans</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<STRONG>1. Installment Plans</STRONG>. Realizing not many people can write a
$5,000 or $10,000 check at the  beginning of each semester, many colleges soften
the blow by letting you spread the payments.  Furthermore, by taking advantage
of installment plans, you may not have to borrow as much as you  originally
thought. If a college doesn't have a plan of its own, ask whether it works with
Academic  Management Service (800-635-0120), Knight Payment Plan (800-225-6783),
or Tuition  Management Systems (800-722-4867). AMS alone has contracts with
1,500 schools, but  sometimes you have to ask the right person the right
question to find out. Here are variants you may  encounter.<BR>
</P>
<P>Interest: (1) No interest (2) Fixed interest (3) Interest on the remaining
balance (4) No interest, but  a one-time fee.<BR>
</P>
<P>Down Payment: (1) No down payment (2) Down payment of 1/3 or 1/4.<BR>
</P>
<P>Payment Frequency: (1) Ten monthly installments (2) Two installments per
semester (3) Four  installments per semester.<BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>2. Prepayment Discount</STRONG>. Pay a year all at once, and your
tuition is discounted, sometimes by as  much as 10%.<BR>
<STRONG>3. Advance Payment Bonus</STRONG>. Place money into your account before
it's due and the college adds  a bonus to your balance. It can be a set dollar
amount (e.g., $100) or it can be a percentage of the  amount on deposit (e.g.,
2%).<BR>
<STRONG>4. Tuition Freezes</STRONG>. A guarantee that tuition will hold for a
set time or that it won't increase by  more than a fixed percentage (e.g., 3%).
Some schools use freezes to improve retention and limit  them to 3rd and 4th
year students.<BR>
<STRONG>5. Guaranteed Tuition Plans I</STRONG>. No Prepayment. Guarantees
students their tuition will not be  increased in their sophomore, junior, and
senior years.<BR>
<STRONG>6. Guaranteed Tuition Plans II</STRONG>. Deposit Required. Same as
preceding plan, but the college  requires you to maintain a set sum on
deposit-anywhere from $500 to $3,000. These plans may a  have a financing
option.<BR>
<STRONG>7. Guaranteed Tuition Plans III</STRONG>. Prepayment Required. Pay four
years tuition in advance, at the  rate which prevails your freshman year.
Parents who can make an out-of-pocket prepayment must  decide whether the
tuition increases they will be spared are worth more than what their money 
could earn in interest if it had not been used for prepayment. If the money is
to be borrowed,  parents usually have two choices: (1) The sponsoring college
will act as lender, offering money at a  favorable interest rate. Repayment may
extend from four to fifteen years. (2) Parents might raise the  money by
borrowing against the equity in their house. The interest rate may or may not be
higher  than the rate offered by the college. One advantage is that interest
payments on home equity loans  of up to $100,000 are tax deductible.<BR>
<STRONG>8. Guaranteed Tuition Plans IV</STRONG>. Other Types. At some schools,
the guaranteed tuition plan  covers as many years as parents can pay in
advance-one, two, three, or four. At others, the school  will sweeten the pot by
rebating say 10% of the payment at the end of each year.<BR>
<STRONG>9. Stretched Payments</STRONG>. Not unlike a loan. Parents of students
who do not qualify for aid defer a  fixed amount of their tuition bill. They are
given two years to pay the deferred amount and are  charged a slight interest
rate. <BR>
<STRONG>10. Barter</STRONG>. A usable service provided by you or your parents
is exchanged for tuition.<BR>
<STRONG>11. Three-Year Option</STRONG>. Some colleges offer a &quot;time-shortened
degree option&quot; that permits  students to meet graduation requirements in
three years, saving one year in tuition costs. <BR>
<STRONG>12. Two Degrees in One</STRONG>. Students can also save a year's
tuition by finding schools that offer joint  undergraduate-graduate degree
programs. For example, students can receive their BA-MBA in five  years instead
of the usual six, or a BA-MA in four years instead of the usual five. <BR>
<STRONG>13. Choice of Accommodations and Meal Plans</STRONG>. Do you need a
spacious room with a  spectacular view, or are you happy contemplating the
backside of a dumpster? Do you need 21  meals a week in the dining hall or would
you rather fend for yourself when the menu reads &quot;Chef's  Surprise&quot; or
&quot;Mystery Meat?&quot; Colleges give you options. Some colleges have housing
contracts that  vary up to $2,000 per year, depending on location and type of
room. Others offer several different  meal plans. Cost difference: from $25 to
$1,000 per year.<BR>
<STRONG>14. Use of Credit Cards for Bill Payment</STRONG>. Provides credit card
holders with some flexibility but  can cost them dearly in finance charges. If
you pay by this option, you might consider using an  &quot;affinity&quot; credit
card that at least gives you a bonus, like frequent flier miles. Or, use the
college's  own card. <BR>
<STRONG>15. Use of Electronic Bank Transfers</STRONG>. A set amount is
transferred directly from your account to  the college each month.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Thirty Six Innovative Aid Programs</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<STRONG>1. Academic Scholarships</STRONG>. Over 1200 colleges and universities
offer scholarships-generally of the  &quot;no-need&quot; type-to students who
meet special criteria in grade point averages, SAT/ACT scores, or  class
standing. <BR>
<STRONG>2. Research Assistants</STRONG>. Some (hoity-toity) colleges claim not
to offer merit-based awards,  because if they did, &quot;all of their students
would deserve one.&quot; Some of these schools do, however,  offer the students
they most want to enroll special financial incentives, like research jobs with
their  choice of faculty (complete with large stipends) or high-paying summer
internships. <BR>
<STRONG>3. Low Interest Loans</STRONG>. Many colleges have become low-interest
lenders to offset Uncle Sam's  yo-yo student aid policies and provide parents
with financial planning stability. <BR>
<STRONG>4. Quickie Loans</STRONG>. Many colleges offer short term loans to tide
students over in times of temporary  financial crisis. These loans usually run
from $100 to $500, but sometimes students can get up to  $5,000.<BR>
<STRONG>5. Replacing Loans</STRONG>. Many schools let you use outside
scholarships to replace the loan component  of your aid package. Some schools
limit this bonus to bright students, or convert your loan to a  grant only if
you maintain a certain GPA. Others make the switch only if you find the
scholarship  before your loan gets processed. You should also ask if the school
has a limit (e.g., $2,000) on the  total amount it will replace.<BR>
<STRONG>6. Middle Income Assistance Programs</STRONG>. Special loans and
scholarships for middle-income  families.<BR>
<STRONG>7. Asset-Rich Families</STRONG>. Land-rich families whose holdings are &quot;non-liquid&quot;
but disqualify them for  assistance can sometimes get special consideration.<BR>
<STRONG>8. Family Plans</STRONG>. Rebates or lower tuitions when more than one
family member enrolls. And that  includes not only brother and sister, but also
Mom, Dad and Grandma. <BR>
<STRONG>9. Alumni Children</STRONG>. Tuition breaks for alumni kids are also
common. Colleges like to establish  multi-generation relationships with
families. That's how chairs get endowed and buildings get built.<BR>
<STRONG>10. Peace of Mind</STRONG>. Some schools waive (or reduce) tuition if
the person primarily responsible for  the student's support dies or suffers
total disability.<BR>
<STRONG>11. Incentives for Academic Achievement</STRONG>. Many colleges have
special awards for the top  enrolled (continuing) students. Other schools offer
academic awards to any student who was in the  top 10% of their high school
class. Finally, some schools will convert part of a student's loans to  grants
if the student maintains a high GPA.<BR>
<STRONG>12. Matching Scholarships</STRONG>. Some schools match church
scholarships. Other schools match state 
<STRONG>regents awards, or Dollars for Scholars awards.<BR> 13. Remissions for
Student Leaders</STRONG>. Many colleges provide discounts to campus leaders, for
 example, student government officers, school newspaper editors. You won't get
this money your  first year, but you should know about it so that you can start
planning your campaign for student  body president.<BR>
<STRONG>14. Remissions for Work</STRONG>. At Warren Wilson (NC) and Blackburn
(IL) students get free room  and board. But they must put in fifteen hours of
campus work every week. Berea (KY) charges no  tuition to students of limited
means, but requires them to work ten hours/week. Many other schools  provide
room and board for residence hall assistants and supervisors. You may not
qualify in your  first year, but it's an opportunity you should know about.<BR>
<STRONG>15. Emphasis on Student Employment</STRONG>. Many colleges have beefed
up their placement offices to  help students find on- and off-campus employment.
<BR>
<STRONG>16. Off-Hour Rates</STRONG>. Many colleges set lower credit hour
charges for courses taken during  off-hours-evenings, weekends and summers. The
difference can be as high as $300 per course or a  50% reduction in room rates
(for summer school).<BR>
<STRONG>17. Moral Obligation Scholarships</STRONG>. Not a scholarship. Not a
loan. The college provides money  to the student and attaches a moral-but not
legal-obligation to pay it back after graduation. A  special sweetener: Until
IRS changes its rules, the pay-back becomes a gift to the college and a tax 
deduction to the former student. <BR>
<STRONG>18. Trial Attendance</STRONG>. Some colleges say, &quot;Try us you'll
like us&quot; and will offer new students a  discount on their first few
credits. For example, the school may offer free classes to high school  juniors
and seniors, it may let some students try the school for one semester for a low
fee (e.g.,  $25), or it may run a free summer program to give students a little
taste.<BR>
<STRONG>19. Bucking the Trend</STRONG>. Some colleges seek to win the
enrollment competition by freezing or even  lowering tuition.<BR>
<STRONG>20. Special Scholarship Drives</STRONG>. Some schools have launched
special fundraising drives aimed at  increasing their in-house financial aid
kitty. <BR>
<STRONG>21. Helping Students Find Scholarships</STRONG>. Hundreds of schools
have special offices to help  students find grants, scholarships, etc.<BR>
<STRONG>22. Older Student Remissions</STRONG>. If you are over 24, some schools
will give you a discount on  tuition, however, at most school, &quot;older&quot;
means 50 or 60. In fact, many public schools offer free  tuition to senior
citizens as long as they are state residents and attend on a space available
basis.<BR>
<STRONG>23. Special Students</STRONG>. Colleges look for students with unique
interests or backgrounds. Many give  special scholarships to any member of the
National Honor Society or students who want to be math  or science teachers.<BR>
<STRONG>24. Persistence Awards</STRONG>. Schools used to worry about retention
rates. Now they worry about  student persistence. The name may have changed (a
feeble effort by educators to shift responsibility  for retention from school to
student) but the concept hasn't. To recoup all the money they spend  recruiting
new students, schools must keep them enrolled (and paying at least some tuition)
for four  years. Accordingly, to keep you from transferring or dropping out,
some colleges offer financial  inducements such as canceling part of your loans
or considering you for extra scholarships. <BR>
<STRONG>25. Travel Awards</STRONG>. Some schools want to repay you either for a
campus visit or, if you are  enrolled, for your commuting costs. <BR>
<STRONG>26. Loan Origination Fee</STRONG>. Stafford Loans carry a 3%
origination fee. Some schools will pay your  origination fee.<BR>
<STRONG>27. Adopt-a-Student</STRONG>. At some schools, local churches and
community groups help students with  scholarship money. Other schools work with
local businesses (some companies even extend  interest-free loans to students
that are forgiven if the student, after graduation, goes to work for the 
sponsor).<BR>
<STRONG>28. Students Helping Students</STRONG>. When that happens, it's a sign
of good student morale and a  friendly campus. Some examples we've heard about
recently: Phonathons to raise scholarship  money; placing all returned
room-damage deposits in a scholarship fund; depositing all parking fines  in a
scholarship fund.<BR>
<STRONG>29. Running Start</STRONG>. High school students can spend their senior
year, or the summer before their  senior year on a campus, taking regular
college classes. Colleges look on such students as a farm  club. Be sure to ask:
Are the courses for college credit? If so, are the credits good only at the 
offering college or are they transferable?<BR>
<STRONG>30. Help for the Unemployed</STRONG>. Some schools offer free tuition
to students from families whose  major wage earner is unemployed.<BR>
<STRONG>31. Free Tuition for Farmers</STRONG>. Some schools offer up to a year
of free tuition to farmers who have  had to quit farming because of financial
hardships.<BR>
<STRONG>32. A Birthday Gift</STRONG>. To celebrate its 100th anniversary, Dana
(NE) let each graduating senior  award a $4,000 scholarship to any incoming
student. Goucher (MD) celebrated its 100th birthday  by allowing selected
students to pay 1885 tuition rates, $100/year. While these opportunities are 
past, keep your eyes open for similar &quot;celebrations.&quot; <BR>
<STRONG>33. Guaranteed Degree</STRONG>. Some schools allow graduates who are
unhappy with their major  (because they couldn't find a job, maybe) to return to
the alma mater and major in another field,  tuition-free, or at least at reduced
tuition. One school, Saint Norbert College promises that if a  student doesn't
graduate in four years because the college failed to offer a required class, the
school  will pay the additional tuition.<BR>
<STRONG>34. Tuition Equalization</STRONG>. To compete more effectively with
public schools for top students, some  private colleges offer their own tuition
equalization programs. At Bard College (NY), first year  students who were in
the top ten of their high school class pay only as much tuition as they would 
have paid had they gone to their state-supported school. The University of
Rochester is giving  alumni children and all students from NY State a $5,000
discount on tuition. They hope this will lure  students who don't need
additional assistance, thus actually save on financial aid expenses.<BR>
<STRONG>35. Toll-Free Numbers</STRONG>. Hundreds of schools send aid recipients
a toll-free number and the name  of a &quot;personal financial counselor&quot;
with whom to discuss financing options.<BR>
<STRONG>36. Reward for Community Service</STRONG>. Many schools encourage
students to participate in  community service. Some even give course credit.
Campus Compact, c/o Brown University, Box  1975, Providence, RI 02912 is a
coalition of 520 colleges serving 140,000 students. Campus  Outreach Opportunity
League is a coalition that serves students at nearly 650 schools. (COOL,  1511 K

<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>The Rich Schools</STRONG></FONT><BR> Rich schools
generally have more funds for student aid than poor schools. At some, the
average  need-based grant ranges from $10,000 to $15,000! Rich schools also have
greater flexibility in  making financial aid awards. It's their money, so they
are better able to take individual  circumstances into account than schools that
dispense, in the main, public funds. Wealth can be  judged in one of two ways:
(1) Total endowment or (2) endowment per enrolled student. Here are  schools
with mountains of money:<BR>
<STRONG>Over $2 billion: </STRONG>Harvard, U. of Texas System, Yale, Princeton,
Stanford, Emory, Texas A&amp;M  System, Columbia, U. of California, MIT,
Washington U..<BR>
<STRONG>Over $1 billion:</STRONG> U. of Pennsylvania, Rice, Cornell,
Northwestern, U. of Chicago, U. of Michigan .<BR>
<STRONG>Over $400 million:</STRONG> Notre Dame, Dartmouth, U. of Southern
California, Johns Hopkins, U. of  Virginia, Duke, New York U., U. of Minnesota,
CalTech, U. of Rochester, Brown, Case Western,  Rockefeller U., Purdue, Ohio
State, Swarthmore, Wellesley, U. of Delaware, Smith, Boston  College,
Macalester, U. of Cincinnati, Southern Methodist, Grinnell, U. of Pittsburgh, 
Carnegie-Mellon, Indiana U., U. of Richmond, Texas Christian, Pomona,
Williams,Wake Forest,  and Georgetown<BR>
<STRONG>Endowment per student</STRONG> leads to different rankings. Rockefeller
U., Princeton, Harvard, CalTech,  Rice, Grinnell, Swarthmore, Yale.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Leadership in Selected Fields</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Colleges that are acknowledged leaders in selected disciplines (e.g., the
Midwestern colleges in  agriculture; the western schools in mining and geology)
are usually heavily endowed by private  sponsors in the areas of their special
expertise. You are far more likely to find an agriculture  scholarship at Iowa
State than at Baruch College in New York City, or a petroleum engineering 
scholarship at the University of Oklahoma than at the University of the District
of Columbia.<BR> For opinions on who is best in what, ask the guidance office
or school library to pick up a copy of 
<EM>Rugg's Recommendations on the Colleges</EM> ($19.95, Rugg's
Recommendations, 7120 Serena  Court, Atascadero, CA 93422). Another (perhaps
better) way to get this kind of information is to  speak with people you respect
in your intended academic/career field. Find out where they went to  school, and
ask if they have any recommendations.<BR>
<STRONG>A tip</STRONG>: Strong departments usually have funds they control
themselves rather than the financial aid  office. Consider dropping a note to
the department head and ask about the possibility of  departmental assistance.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Working With Financial Aid Administrators</STRONG></FONT><BR>
The median salary of financial aid directors in 1995/96 was $45,400. You might
keep that sum in  mind as you get ready to explain how your $100,000 income has
been ravaged by inflation to the  point of making it impossible-absolutely
impossible-to handle your family contribution. Interestingly  (but not
surprisingly), studies show that with low-income families, willingness to pay
exceeds their  ability, while with high income families, ability to pay exceeds
their willingness. <BR> Remember that financial aid administrators primarily
dispense public funds-tax money-and such  expenditures are usually strictly
controlled by law and regulations. Financial aid administrators do  have some
flexibility in awarding the colleges' own funds and in treating changed
circumstances-such  unfortunate events as death, disability, disaster, and
divorce. If you feel that any element of your  award letter-the student's
expense budget, your family contribution, or the mix of aid programs 
offered-should be changed, then go ahead and call the office. But do so with
sound reasons and, if  necessary, with documentation. Let them know about better
aid offers you have received, but don't  take the approach that you're cutting a
deal. Financial aid administrators are professionals working  with limited
funds. If they agree to increase your award, it's frequently at the expense of
another's.  The FAA will not make that decision lightly, and never without good
cause. So before you bully  your way into the financial aid office demanding a
recount, document your case carefully and keep  in mind that one catches more
Drosophila Melanogaster with honey than with vinegar.</P>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Meet Your Uncle-Uncle Sam</STRONG></FONT><BR> For many
students, applying for financial aid represents their first encounter with Uncle
Sam. One  thing will become apparent very quickly. Getting things from Uncle Sam
is no more pleasant an  experience than giving him things, like your money at
tax time. Here is what you should expect:</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Uncle Sam likes forms</STRONG>. Lots of forms. Most of the forms have
an awkward layout, an illogical  sequence, and poorly written instructions.<BR>
<STRONG>Uncle Sam makes a sharp distinction between &quot;authorizations&quot;
and &quot;appropriations.&quot; </STRONG>A  program may be authorized, but that
doesn't mean a nickel will be spent (appropriated) for it. In  other words,
before you rejoice over a new $10 billion student aid program, make sure the
money  has actually been appropriated.<BR>
<STRONG>Uncle loves semantics and fine distinctions</STRONG>. His authorization
bill may promise a chicken in  every pot. But the enabling legislation, usually
expressed in regulations, may define &quot;chicken&quot; as &quot;any  part of
the bird,&quot; a claw, a feather... Or the definition may emphasize the avian
nature of a chicken.  The operative word then becomes &quot;bird&quot; and any
bird can be substituted for a chicken-pigeon,  crow...<BR>
<STRONG>Uncle is a social engineer</STRONG>. After redefining chicken, he will
turn his attention to the pot. He may  rule that anybody who owns a pot large
enough to hold a chicken is too rich to qualify for a fowl.  Only owners of
small pots can get birds-the smaller the pot, the bigger the bird will seem.<BR>
<STRONG>Uncle's promises don't hold for very long</STRONG>. Any program can be
supplemented, altered,  filibustered, modified or rescinded in mid-year or near
election time when it becomes important to  hold down expenses and balance the
budget.<BR>
<STRONG>Uncle likes to arm wrestle with himself</STRONG>. If the Administration
doesn't like what Congress has  mandated (or vice versa), it will miss
deadlines, base its case on budget figures that have already  been rejected (but
not yet replaced), blow smoke over the issues, hold up regulations, or tie up 
appropriated funds. <BR>
<STRONG>Uncle's timing does not correspond to the academic cycle</STRONG>. When
you want to start planning  for the next year, usually in September, Uncle is
not ready for you. By the time he can tell you what  he will do for you, you've
already made your plans.<BR>
</P>
<P>But when all is said and done, Uncle Sam is still your main source of
financial aid. Warts or no  warts, you had better learn to live with him and
like him.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>The Big Six Today</STRONG></FONT><BR> Most of Uncle's
student aid flows through six gigantic programs. Three are student based-Pell 
Grants, Family Education Loans (Stafford and PLUS), and Direct Student Loans
(Direct Stafford  and Direct PLUS). You apply for assistance under these
programs and the money comes to you. <BR>
</P>
<P>The other three programs-Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants,
Work-Study and Perkins  Loans-are campus-based. This means Uncle funds the
programs, but gives the money to the  colleges to dispense in accordance with
federal guidelines. Most of the money goes to full- and  half-time students,
however, if the financial need of part-timers is at least 5% of the need of all
the  students at the school, then at least 5% of campus-based funds must be
offered to these students.<BR> Uncle also funds two state-based programs-Byrd
Honors Scholarships and State Student Incentive  Grants-and one community-based
program-AmeriCorps. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Useful Contacts</STRONG><BR> For information about federal programs,
call the Federal Student Aid Information Center,  800-4-FED-AID, Monday through
Friday between 9:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., EST (TDD:  800-730-8913). Trained staff
can help families complete the FAFSA, explain Expected Family  Contribution and
answer questions about student eligibility. You may also request Uncle's free 
booklet, <EM>The Student Guide: Financial Aid from the Department of Education</EM>.
The number is  NOT to be used for financial counseling, to change information in
your file, to interpret policy, or to  expedite application processing. <BR>
</P>
<P>To check on the status of your application, or to request a duplicate
Student Aid Report, call  319-337-5665. If you suspect fraud or abuse involving
federal student aid funds, please call the  Inspector General's Office at
800-MIS-USED.<BR>

<STRONG>Project EASI (Easy Access for Students and Institutions)</STRONG><BR>
Project EASI is supposed to combine all grant and loan information onto one
computer network,  accessible to students, parents and colleges. Students will
be able to apply for financial aid  electronically as well as view their loan
history and learn about other aspects of admission and  financial aid. It's been
slow going, thanks to recent personnel shake-ups in the Department. But the 
site is partially up and running at <A HREF="http://EASI.ed.gov">http://EASI.ed.gov</A>.

<P><FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>PELL GRANTS</STRONG></FONT><BR> These make up
Uncle's largest gift program. In 1996/97, over $5.6 billion in Pells will be
dispensed  to 3.7 million students. They are the foundation of student aid, the
bottom layer of the financial aid  package. But they can also be called Pinochio
Grants. Why? Because Uncle seldom holds to the  award range that he promises.
Last year, $2,440 increased to $2,470; before that, $2,400 became  $2,340. How
does this happen? Easy. Pells are a big part of the Education budget and
increasing  or decreasing 3.7 million Pells by $50, $100 or $200 can make a big
difference in the budget  numbers. Last year's last minute increase was a first,
perhaps to salve the consciences of  over-zealous budget cutters who decimated
so many other social safety-net programs. So what will  the award range be for
1997/98? Congressional leaders finally agreed with the president, so the top 
award will increase to $2,700. <BR>
</P>
<P>How large a Pell will you get? It varies with your expected family
contribution, the cost of education  at your school and your student status. If
you are a part-time, half-time or three-quarter time  student, you receive 25%,
50% or 75% of your award, respectively. Uncle publishes tables with  exact
levels of Pell funding, but to get an estimate, if the cost of college exceeds
the maximum Pell  (e.g., $2,700), just subtract your EFC from the maximum grant.
For example, assuming an award  range of $400 to $2,700, an EFC of $1,200
translates into $1,500 for full-time students ($750 for  half-time students); an
EFC of $2,500 gets you nothing.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>For Whom the Pell Tolls</STRONG><BR> You apply for a Pell by
completing the FAFSA. Make certain to go this route, even if you're certain  you
aren't eligible. Colleges and the states expect you to do so and won't consider
you for other  awards until they know your Pell status. The only way for them to
know your Pell status is by seeing  results from your FAFSA.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Family Education Loans and Direct Student Loans</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Uncle Sam now runs two parallel student loan programs:<BR>
</P>
<P><EM>Federal Family Education Loans</EM>: Subsidized Staffords, Unsubsidized
Staffords and PLUS.  These loans are made by commercial lenders. <BR>
<EM>Federal Direct Student Loans</EM>: Direct Subsidized Staffords, Direct
Unsubsidized Staffords, and  Direct PLUS. These loans are made by Uncle Sam.<BR>
</P>
<P>Interest rates, annual and aggregate loan limits, fees, deferments,
cancellations, and forbearance  terms are essentially the same. Repayment
options vary slightly. The main difference, as far as the  student is concerned,
is who lends them the money. So why are there two different programs?  Politics,
as usual. Can you borrow under both? No! Your college will tell you which
program it  prefers.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Stafford Loans</STRONG><BR> Formerly called Guaranteed Student Loans,
the program was renamed in honor of retired Senator  Robert T. Stafford (R-VT).
Stafford Loans are low-interest loans to undergraduate and graduate  students
enrolled at least half-time. They are available to all families without regard
to financial need.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Which Stafford Loan is for you?</STRONG><BR>
<EM>Students with financial need</EM> may receive a subsidized Stafford in
which Uncle pays the interest  while they are in school and during any
deferments.<BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>Students without financial need</EM> may receive an unsubsidized
Stafford in which interest accrues  while they are in school and during any
deferments. <BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>Students with partial financial </EM>need may receive a combination of
the two, depending on their  status (dependent vs. independent) and level of
need.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Loan Limits:</STRONG><BR>
<EM>Dependent Undergraduates</EM>: Freshmen may borrow up to $2625 per year.
Sophomores may  borrow $3500 per year. Juniors, seniors and fifth year
undergrads may borrow $5500 per year.  The maximum undergraduate loan amount is
$23,000. These limits apply whether the money comes  from the subsidized or
unsubsidized program (or a combination of the two). For example, a  freshman who
receives a $1500 subsidized Stafford may also borrow $1125 under the 
unsubsidized program.<BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>Independent Undergraduates</EM>: Freshmen may borrow $6625 per year.
Sophomores may borrow  $7500 per year (in both cases at least $4000 must come
from the unsubsidized program). Juniors,  seniors and fifth year undergraduates
may borrow up to $10,500 per year (of which at least $5000  must come from the
unsubsidized program). The maximum an independent student may borrow  during his
or her undergraduate years is $46,000.<BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>Graduate Students</EM> may borrow up to $18,500 per year (of which at
least $10,000 must come  from the unsubsidized program) to a maximum of $138,500
($65,500 in subsidized loans, $73,000  in unsubsidized loans). This limit
includes any money they borrowed as an undergraduate.<BR>
<EM>Additional Limits</EM>: In no case may a Stafford Loan exceed the cost of
attendance at your school  minus any other financial aid you receive. </P>
<P><BR>
<EM>Prorated loan limits</EM>: Borrowing limits are prorated for programs of
less than a full academic year.  For example, students attending the equivalent
of 1/3 of an academic year are eligible for 1/3 the  maximum annual loan amount.<BR>
<STRONG>Loan Origination Fee and Insurance Fees</STRONG>. Commercial lenders
subtract a 3% loan origination  fee and a 1% insurance fee. If your loan comes
from Uncle, you pay a combined 4% instead.<BR>
<STRONG>Interest Rate</STRONG>. The rate is adjusted annually to equal 3.1%
more than the bond equivalent of the  91-day T-bill with an 8.25% cap. This
year, it is 8.25%.<BR>
<STRONG>Interest Subsidy</STRONG>. For families with demonstrated financial
need, Uncle Sam pays interest on the  loan while the student is in school and
for a six-month grace period after the student completes his  or her studies.<BR>
<STRONG>Minimum Annual Repayment</STRONG>. $600.<BR>
<STRONG>Years to Repay</STRONG>. 5 to 10.<BR>
<STRONG>Who Makes Loans?</STRONG> Private lenders-Banks, Credit Unions,
Insurance Companies. Also Uncle  Sam (for students Direct Lending schools).<BR>
<STRONG>Application Procedure</STRONG>. Obtain a Common Loan Application and
Promissory Note from the  lender. Fill out the application. Send it to your
school's financial aid administrator for certification.  The application then
goes back to the lender and guaranteeing agency who will disburse the loan to 
the school. If your school participates in Direct Lending, you do not need to
file an additional  application. The aid administrator can certify your
eligibility for a Stafford based on results from  your FAFSA and ask Uncle to
wire money directly to your school account.<BR> Under certain circumstances,
loans can be deferred, postponed, canceled or considered for  forbearance. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>PLUS Loans</STRONG><BR> PLUS loans are not based on financial need so
you may use them to cover your expected family  contribution. In fact,
creditworthy parents may borrow an amount equal to the student's total cost of 
attendance less any aid received.<BR> If a parent is judged not to be credit
worthy, the student may borrow an additional amount under  the unsubsidized
Stafford; freshmen and sophomores get an extra $4,000; juniors and seniors, an 
extra $5,000 (these amounts correspond to the higher borrowing limits for an
independent  undergraduate).<BR>
<STRONG>Loan Origination Fee and Insurance Fees</STRONG>. Lenders may subtract
a 3% loan origination fee and  a 1% insurance fee. If your loan comes from
Uncle, you pay a combined 4% instead. <BR>
<STRONG>Interest Rate</STRONG>. The rate is adjusted annually to equal 3.1%
more than the bond equivalent of the  52-week T-bill and carries a 9% cap.
Currently, it is 8.72%. <BR>
<STRONG>Interest Subsidy</STRONG>. There is no interest subsidy to borrowers.<BR>
<STRONG>Repayment</STRONG> begins within 60 days of taking out the loan and
extends from 5 to 10 years.  Repayment can be deferred while the student is in
school; interest, however, continues to accrue.<BR>
<STRONG>Who Makes Loans?</STRONG> Private lenders-Banks, S&amp;Ls, Credit
Unions, some states, and Uncle Sam  (for students attending schools
participating in Direct Lending).<BR>
<STRONG>Application procedures</STRONG> are similar to Stafford Loans. <BR>
Under certain conditions, loans can be deferred, postponed or canceled.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY GRANTS</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Uncle will give the colleges $583 million for SEOGs next year.<BR>
<STRONG>Size of awards</STRONG>. From $100 to $4,000 per year of undergraduate
study.<BR>
<STRONG>Criteria for Selection</STRONG>. Need and availability of funds. Be
smart. Apply early. Nearly 1 million  SEOG recipients each year; priority goes
to those receiving Pells. </P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>WORK-STUDY</STRONG></FONT><BR> Uncle will give the
colleges about $830 million for work-study next year.<BR>
<STRONG>Eligibility</STRONG>. About 713,000 participants each year, both
undergraduate and graduate students.  President Clinton would like to see this
number increase to one million by the year 2000, as  work-study students are
more likely to stay in school and graduate with substantially less debt.<BR>
<STRONG>Criteria for Selection</STRONG>. Need and availability of funds. Be
smart. Apply early.<BR>
<STRONG>Program Description</STRONG>. On- and off-campus employment. Salary
must be at least equal to minimum  wage. You cannot earn more money than your
award stipulates. Thus, if you receive a $1,000  award, your employment lasts
until you earn $1,000 and then it is terminated for that academic  year.
Employment may not involve any political or religious activity nor may students
be used to  replace regular employees. Schools must use 5% of their funds for
community service projects (this  requirement may be waived for select schools).</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>PERKINS LOANS</STRONG></FONT><BR> The college acts as
lender, using funds originally provided by the federal government. Uncle adds 
about $160 million per year, and there is now $1 billion in &quot;revolving fund&quot;
capital (money paid  back by borrowers). Last year, about 725,000 students
received an average of $1,342 each.<BR>
<STRONG>Eligibility</STRONG>. Undergraduate and graduate students.<BR>
<STRONG>Criteria for Selection</STRONG>. Need and availability of funds. Be
smart. Apply early.<BR>
<STRONG>Loan Limits</STRONG>: $3,000 per year for undergraduates to a maximum
of $15,000; $5,000 per year for  graduate study to a maximum of $30,000 (less
any Perkins money borrowed as an undergraduate).  At schools participating in
Uncle's Expanded Lending Option (to participate, schools must first have 
default rates under 7.5%), undergraduate students may borrow up to $4,000 per
year to a  maximum of $20,000; graduate students may borrow up to $6,000 per
year to a maximum of  $40,000 (less any Perkins money borrowed as an
undergraduate).<BR>
<STRONG>Minimum Annual Repayment</STRONG>. $480.<BR>
<STRONG>Interest rate</STRONG>. 5%.<BR>
<STRONG>Interest Subsidy</STRONG>. Student pays no interest while in school or
during a 9-month grace period  following graduation.<BR>
<STRONG>Repayment</STRONG>. 10 years. You may repay via electronic bank
transfers. Also, under some  circumstances, loans can be deferred, postponed,
forgiven, or canceled. </P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>On Defaulting</STRONG></FONT><BR> Uncle Sam rewards
and punishes colleges for their ability to collect on loans. Schools with small 
default rates (under 7.5%) get an increased infusion of Perkins capital; schools
with high default  rates (25% +) for three years running may become ineligible
for federal funds altogether. (No  Perkins money. No Stafford money. No Pell
money. No any kind of federal student aid money.)  The national default rate is
currently about 13% per year (generally lower at four-year schools and  higher
at trade schools). It may pay you to ask schools for their default rate before
you apply.<BR>
</P>
<P>Uncle Sam can also punish you if you are one of the defaulters, as he
should, since in our book,  defaulters eclipse even the most parasitic protozoa!
He can notify credit bureaus which will damage  your credit rating. He can
withhold your tax refunds until your loan is repaid. Or, he can garnish  your
wages (and fine your employer if he/she doesn't follow through). As Uncle gets
tougher, the  default problem gets better, but at some trade schools defaults
still run as high as 85%.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Loan Repayment Options</STRONG></FONT><BR> Borrowers
with multiple federal loans, or who face larger monthly payments than they can
handle  under standard, ten-year plans, may want to consolidate their loans
and/or use a longer-term  repayment plan. Again, Uncle is running two parallel
programs, which we'll call regular consolidation  and direct consolidation.
Under all of these plans, your monthly payments will be smaller but the  total
amount you repay much greater than under regular (10-year) repayment. For more 
information, check with Uncle Sam or the institution that gave you your loan.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Extended Repayment</STRONG><BR> Repayment may extend for 10 years for
students with less than $7,500 in loans; 12 years for  students with between
$7,500 and $10,000 in loans; 15 years for students with between $10,000  and
$20,000; 20 years for students with between $20,000 and $40,000; 25 years for
students with  between $40,000 and $60,000; and 30 years for those lucky
students with more than $60,000 to  repay. Under regular consolidation, the
interest rate cannot exceed the weighted average of all the  loans rounded up to
the nearest whole percent. Some lenders charge less than this maximum. Shop 
around. Under direct consolidation, the interest rate cannot exceed 8.25% for
Staffords and 9% for  PLUS. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Graduated Repayment</STRONG><BR> Students repay their loan within the
framework described above, but payments start small (when  incomes are low), and
increase over time (while incomes also rise). </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Income-Sensitive Repayment</STRONG><BR> This option is available only
from commercial lenders. Students work with their lender to establish a  more
flexible repayment schedule than the ones above. Payments may be adjusted
annually to  reflect current and future earning potential. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Income Contingent Repayment</STRONG><BR> This option is available only
under Direct Consolidation. Uncle Sam has developed a complex  formula for
determining repayment rates; they vary depending on your income and the size of
your  loan. For example, a single borrower with an income of $25,000 would begin
repaying a $12,500  loan at $117 per month while a borrower earning $35,000
would repay that same loan at $137 per  month. After 25 years, a borrower who
has been repaying faithfully, but has not yet retired the loan,  will have the
rest of his or her debt forgiven. On the down-side, the IRS will count your
forgiven  loan as in-kind (and taxable) income. Also, students opting for this
payment option might wind up  paying thousands more in interest than their
counterparts who choose one of the other repayment  options. Finally, PLUS loans
may not be repaid using the Income Contingent option. </P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarships</STRONG></FONT><BR>
No-need, renewable awards of $1,500 intended to promote student excellence. Each
state  establishes its own criteria and selects recipients.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>AmeriCorps</STRONG></FONT><BR> Participants receive a
minimum wage stipend and a $4,725 credit per year of full-time service (for a 
maximum of two years). They may use the credit at any college or graduate
school, or to pay down  outstanding student loans. Furthermore, the money does
not affect their eligibility for other federal  student aid. Currently, 23,000
students serve in 350 different programs with Uncle Sam providing  most of the
funding, but states and nonprofits doing the hiring. Prime projects are those
that address  unmet needs in education (assisting teachers in Head Start), the
environment (recycling or  conservation projects), human services (building
housing for the homeless) or public safety (leading  drug education seminars).
Interested students should apply directly to a funded program (for a list,  call
AmeriCorps, 800-94-ACORPS).</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Looking Toward Reauthorization</STRONG></FONT><BR> The
Higher Education Act that authorizes all these programs expires in September,
1997 although  chances are Congress will approve a one year extension and unveil
new regulations in 1998. Here  are some items being considered: Use tax
incentives to encourage families and businesses to save  and spend on college.
Require schools to provide a greater share of SEOG and Work-Study funds. 
Collapse all loan programs into one; make the source of funds transparent to the
student and let the  schools participate in the programs of their choice.
Frontload Pell, doubling the size of grants, but  limiting them to first and
second year students. Exclude trade schools from Pell, and move programs  for
trade school students to the Labor Department.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>America's HOPE Scholarships</STRONG><BR> President Clinton calls
education the &quot;Continental Divide&quot; between those who will prosper 
economically and those who will not. Unfortunately, many families feel priced
out of college. To  address this growing problem, he has proposed America's Hope
Scholarships. Families with  incomes under $100,000 could choose between a tax
credit or a tax deduction, whichever would  save them more. <BR>
</P>
<P>The tax-credit would be for $1,500 per full-time student for each of two
years (to receive credit in  Year Two, students would need a &quot;B&quot; grade
average). Families that pay less than $1,500 in taxes  would receive a rebate
from the Treasury. <BR>
</P>
<P>The tax deduction would allow families to write off up to $10,000 of income
per year, regardless of  how many students were in school.<BR>
</P>
<P>Good politics or good policy? Some called this plan a
hastily-assembled-election-year gimmick.  And in truth, it languished in
Congress with no pressure for action before the November elections. </P>
<P>Now, however, since Clinton was re-elected, expect to see this highlighted
in the balanced budget  proposal he sends to Congress.</P>

<P>All states maintain extensive programs of grants, tuition assistance, fee
reductions and loans. About  1.7 million students receive over $2.5 billion in
need-based state aid and 250,000 share in $400  million of non-need-based aid.<BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>States making over 50,000 awards</EM>: New York, Pennsylvania,
Illinois, Ohio, California,  Minnesota, Michigan, New Jersey, and Wisconsin -in
that order.<BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>States spending over $50 million on student aid</EM>: New York,
Illinois, California, Pennsylvania,  New Jersey, Ohio, Georgia, Florida,
Minnesota, Michigan, Virginia, Washington, Massachusetts,  Indiana and
Wisconsin-in that order.<BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>States where tuition is most affordable when measured against median
family income are</EM>:  Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, North Carolina,
and Texas.<BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>States which give money to at least 25% of their students</EM>:
Georgia, New York, Minnesota,  New Jersey, Vermont, Ohio, New Mexico,
Pennsylvania, Illinois, Wisconsin, Maine, Colorado,  Washington, Massachusetts,
Kentucky, Virginia.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Eligibility for State-based Student Aid</STRONG></FONT><BR>
States determine eligibility for need-based aid in one of four ways: (1)
Twenty-six states use only  the federal methodology; (2) Fifteen states use the
federal methodology for most of their grants and  a hybrid methodology for a few
other programs; (3) Two states let schools make the decisions  regarding
eligibility (South Dakota and Illinois); and (4) Seven states rely on their own 
system-Louisiana, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and South
Carolina. <BR>
</P>
<P>So, how do you find out which forms to file? In almost all instances, to be
considered eligible for  state-based student aid, you must file Uncle Sam's
FAFSA (and on it, indicate your home state).  Some states, those that use the
institutional methodology, might ask you to use the College Board's  PROFILE,
and finally, some states have their own applications. Important: Many states
have  already noted that using the federal methodology to determine eligibility
means more students are  qualifying for aid. Unfortunately, state grants are not
usually entitlement programs, so when the  money runs out, too bad! Again, apply
early!</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>A Summary of State Programs</STRONG></FONT><BR> No two
states have the same programs. Here are some you should ask about. Your
questions might  lead you to little-known or special opportunities.<BR>
<STRONG>1. Grants for In-State Study</STRONG>. Thanks to matching funds from
Uncle Sam's State Student  Incentive Grant (SSIG), nearly every state offers
need-based grants to undergraduates. <BR>
<STRONG>2. Grants for Out-of-State Study</STRONG>. These are also need-based
grant programs, generally  restricted to undergraduates, but some states have
signed reciprocity agreements with one or more  other states.<BR>
<STRONG>3. Merit Programs</STRONG>. Generally, there are three kinds of merit
programs. The first type is based on  financial need; however, you must meet
some academic threshold to be eligible. The second is  based on academic
accomplishment, but you must demonstrate financial need to qualify for a 
monetary award, otherwise, your recognition is honorary. The last is based
solely on academic  accomplishment. Your award is not affected by your finances.
Funding for merit-based programs is  growing much faster than funding for
need-based programs because states don't want to lose their  best students to
other states.<BR>
<STRONG>4. Special Loans</STRONG>. These loans are separate from any federal
programs. For example, in  Minnesota, first and second year may borrow $4,500
per year at .75% above the 91 day T-bill  rate (Juniors and Seniors may borrow
$6,000 per year). For all these plans, the loan money is  usually secured
through tax-exempt bonds issued by the state. In some cases, out-of-state
students  attending a school in the state underwriting the loans may benefit
from the low rates.<BR>
<STRONG>5. Teaching</STRONG>. To increase the supply of teachers, many states
have instituted special loan programs,  with &quot;forgiveness&quot; features if
the students actually end up in classrooms. If the students don't go into 
teaching, they must repay the aid. Some programs limit their benefits to
students who teach in a  shortage area. This could mean a subject area like math
or science. It could also mean a geographic  area like rural America or the
inner-city. <BR>
<STRONG>6. Special Fields</STRONG>. This category covers a variety of programs
designed to increase representation  in other fields in which the state believes
it has shortages. These fields may include medicine,  nursing, special
education, bilingual education, etc. Many graduate programs are included in this
 category.<BR>
<STRONG>7. Minority Group Programs</STRONG>. The beneficiaries must usually be
African-American, Latino or  Native American (Eskimo, Indian, or Aleutian).<BR>
<STRONG>8. Work-Study</STRONG>. State operated programs similar to the federal
work-study or cooperative  education programs.<BR> 9. Veterans. Special state
benefits to state residents who served in the Armed Forces, usually  during
times of hostilities.<BR>
<STRONG>10. National Guard</STRONG>. State educational benefits for serving in
the state's National Guard. These are  in addition to federal benefits.<BR>
<STRONG>11. Special Benefits</STRONG>. These go to state residents who are
dependents of deceased or disabled  veterans, POWs, MIAs, or police/firefighters
killed on duty.<BR>
<STRONG>12. Military Dependents</STRONG>. Some states let military personnel
and dependents stationed within the  state, attend in-state universities at
in-state rates.<BR>
<STRONG>13. Tuition Savings Plans</STRONG>. More and more states are operating
plans (or have legislation pending)  that encourage early planning for college,
either &quot;Baccalaureate Bonds,&quot; the income from which is  tax exempt if
used to pay college expenses, or &quot;Prepaid Tuition Plans&quot; in which
parents can  guarantee tuition at any of the state's public (or in some cases,
private) colleges by making a lump  sum investment or periodic payments. <BR>
<STRONG>14. Reciprocal Arrangements I</STRONG>. Reciprocal arrangements between
states often permit students  living near a state's border to study in the
adjoining state at discounted tuition rates. Sometimes this  means students pay
less by going out-of-state than if they stayed at home. Other times, students
pay  the same amount whether they go out-of -state or stay home. Unfortunately,
these kinds of &quot;trade  imbalances&quot; when combined with ever tightening
state budgets are causing some states (especially  those that take in more
students than they send away) to rethink the finances of reciprocity and  scale
back on their agreements.<BR>
<STRONG>15. Reciprocal Arrangements II</STRONG>. Study out of state at reduced
rates when your desired major is  not offered in state. Such arrangements are
coordinated by consortia such as WICHE (PO Box  9752, Boulder, CO 80301,
http://www.wiche.edu) which covers western states; the Southern  Regional
Education Board (592 10th Street, NW, Atlanta, GA 30318) which operates in the 
South; and the New England Regional Student Program administered by the New
England Board  of Education (45 Temple Place, Boston, MA 02111). The Midwest
Student Exchange Program  can be contacted via state agencies in the Midwest.<BR>
<STRONG>16. Reciprocal Arrangements III</STRONG>. WICHE offers a second program
in which students pay  reduced tuition at any of the state schools in the
region. The reduced rate equals resident tuition plus  50%; a large savings over
non-resident rates.<BR>
<STRONG>17. Tuition Equalization</STRONG>. These programs reduce the difference
in tuition costs between in-state  public and private colleges. Examples:
Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,  Kentucky, New Mexico, North
Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia and  Wisconsin.
These states make grants worth well over $100 million, although the states which
face  insufficient funds for public schools might start rethinking giving tax
money to private schools.<BR>
<STRONG>18. Grant Programs I</STRONG>. Most states provide special assistance
to students attending private  colleges in state. For example: North Carolina
residents who choose an in-state private college  receive an automatic (non-need
based) $1,150 grant.<BR>
<STRONG>19. Grant Programs II</STRONG>. Some states provide need-based
assistance to residents attending schools  out-of-state. Alaska, Delaware,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ohio,  Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin make grants worth $14.5  million.<BR>
<STRONG>20. Free Scholarship Search</STRONG>. Alabama, Florida, Idaho,
Illinois, Maine and Vermont offer state  residents (free) searches of potential
financial aid sources.<BR>
<STRONG>21. Discounts for Senior Citizens</STRONG>. Most of our states give
tuition discounts to seniors. Some  states waive tuition entirely. <BR>
<STRONG>22. Virtual University</STRONG>. Ten governors (from Arizona, Colorado,
Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico,  North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming)
discussed pooling their resources to create a  Virtual University made up of
professors throughout the region. They don't intend for this university  to
replace the traditional college experience, but to serve the needs of
non-traditional students.<BR>
<STRONG>23. Community College Partnerships</STRONG>. Many states encourage
partnerships between two- and  four-year colleges to help make the transition
seamless and broaden educational access. Sometimes  students are guaranteed
admission to the four-year school. Sometimes they're offered additional aid 
opportunities. And sometimes they are just given guidance on course selection.
For example,  Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida,
Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,  Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio,  South Carolina,
Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.<BR>
<STRONG>24. Community Service Programs</STRONG>. States were way ahead of the
community service  bandwagon. All fifty now have ties to AmeriCorps, while
others also fund their own projects. To  find your State Commission on National
Service and receive a list of funded programs, contact  AmeriCorps,

<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Innovative State Programs</STRONG></FONT><BR> Be on
the lookout for these. There's lots of action on the state level-some of which
will result in  important new programs (and some which will fizzle). <BR> *
<STRONG>Louisiana</STRONG>. START Smart (Student Tuition Assistance and Revenue
Trust) is an innovative  approach to rewarding early savings for college.
Participants save at their own pace and their  money is professionally managed
by the State Treasurer. The state then adds an annual incentive  ranging from 4%
to 14% of the amount deposited during the calendar year. For lower income 
depositors, those with AGIs under $15,000, that match would be at 14%. For
higher income  depositors, those with AGIs between $75,000 and $100,000, that
match would be at 4%.<BR> *<STRONG> Georgia</STRONG>: Helping Outstanding
Pupils Educationally (HOPE) ensures that every qualified (3.0  GPA or better)
Georgia HS grad will receive free tuition at one of Georgia's public colleges or
 universities, or up to $3,000 for a private, in-state school. Students must
maintain a 3.0 GPA while  in college to continue receiving money. Nearly 200,000
students have benefited from this program,  which is funded by the Lottery for
Education. Contact (in Georgia), 800-546-HOPE.<BR> * <STRONG>Michigan</STRONG>:
Tuition Incentive Program (TIP). Low income students can get free tuition at 
community colleges. Those who complete community college are eligible for a
$2,000 voucher for  use at any of Michigan's four year colleges.<BR> *
<STRONG>Maine</STRONG>. Education Network of Maine televises courses throughout
the state at nearly 80 regional  centers and high school sites. Students can
request library materials via their computers, and speak  with professors via
toll free numbers.<BR> * <STRONG>Massachusetts</STRONG>: MassPlan allows
parents to borrow up to the full amount of college (less any  aid received) at a
fixed rate of 7.65% with repayment spread over 15 years. This loan is available
at  63 participating Massachusetts colleges, to all students regardless of their
state of residence. For an  extra $300 parents can take advantage of the Home
Equity Option. By securing the loan with home  equity, interest payments become
tax deductible making the after-tax rate equal to 5.28% for  someone in the 31%
bracket. <BR> * <STRONG>Massachusetts</STRONG>: UPlan is a hybrid of many
other states' college savings plans. Both residents and  nonresidents may invest
in Massachusetts bonds and redeem them later for a guaranteed percentage  of
tuition at any of 70 participating (public and private) Massachusetts colleges.
Assume for  example the parent buys a $5,000 bond. If tuition this year at State
U. is $5,000 and tuition at  Private U. is $20,000, that bond will be worth 100%
of tuition at State U. or 25% at Private U.  regardless of the cost of these two
schools when the student eventually enrolls. Massachusetts has  promised
participating colleges they will be paid a rate equal to the bond's original
value plus  interest equal to 2% over inflation, compounded annually. The beauty
of this plan is not only the  peace of mind it gives investors that their
savings will keep pace with tuition increases, but also the  incentive it gives
colleges to keep tuition increases at or below inflation plus 2%. Because 
Massachusetts invests the money in state-issued bonds, income from the bonds is
exempt from state  taxes, even if the money is not used for tuition. Investors
who decide not to use the money for  tuition receive a return equal to their
original principal compounded by a rate equal to the CPI. As  with most tuition
future plans, smart investors can do better on their own (without limiting their
 college choices), however, for some families, peace of mind is worth this
sacrifice. <BR> For more information on MassPlan or UPlan, visit
<A HREF="http://www.mefa.org">http://www.mefa.org</A>.<BR> * <STRONG>Arkansas,
Louisiana, and Indiana</STRONG>: In Arkansas, they're called Academic Challenge 
Scholarships. In Indiana, they're called Twenty-First Century Scholars. They
have similar themes:  States guarantee to pay in-state tuition for low-income
students who make certain commitments.  For example, students must maintain a
specified GPA in college prep courses and remain drug free.  This
performance-based tuition waiver for at-risk students has been nicknamed &quot;The
Taylor Plan&quot;  after Patrick Taylor, a Louisiana oil man who realized that
many people drop out of HS because  they perceive it as a dead end. He figured
if you promised at-risk students a college education  (assuming they stayed out
of trouble and met admission standards), you'd see a huge increase in 
educational achievement.<BR> *<STRONG> Maine</STRONG>. Maine residents
attending out-of-state schools, and out-of-state students attending Maine 
schools can take out a &quot;Super Loan&quot; at 1% below the current Stafford
rate. The program is  available through 39 participating lenders.<BR> *
<STRONG>Arizona</STRONG>. To encourage &quot;geography bound&quot; students to
pursue four-year degrees, Arizona is  experimenting with a plan that would give
students money to use at under-utilized private colleges  that are nearer to
their homes than any of the state's public schools. This alternative is cheaper
than  building new public university facilities, and will help the state deal
with its expected enrollment  boom.<BR> * <STRONG>Virginia and Texas</STRONG>:
Special incentive grants to induce students of one racial group to attend a 
state public university in which another racial group makes up a significant
proportion of the student  body.<BR> * <STRONG>Colorado, Florida and Minnesota</STRONG>:
Public high school students may take courses at no charge  at any (public)
college in the state that will admit them. Students receive both high school and
 college credit for their work.</P>

<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Company Tuition Aid</STRONG></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>Once upon a time you could go to work for a company that had a tuition
reimbursement plan, take  college courses on your own time, and let the employer
foot the bill. Then the IRS decided this was  too good a deal. It ruled that
courses had to be job-related to qualify as a benefit. Courses not  job-related,
but paid for by the employer, had to be declared as taxable income. That ruling
pulled  the rug out from what had promised to become a major alternative program
for young people. The  reason: Jobs at the bottom are often so narrowly defined
that few courses required for a degree  could pass the &quot;job-related test.&quot;
Why would a shipping clerk need a course in American History?  While hurting
people at the entry level, the law had little impact on the educational pursuits
of the  higher-ups. A manager might justify a course in English Literature to
improve her writing skills and a  sales manager could qualify for an
Anthropology program to better understand the cultural factors  that influence
buying.<BR>
</P>
<P>The Tax-Reform Act of 1986 brought back the exclusion of non job-related
tuition benefits  (Section 127 for anyone who cares to read the 1.3 million word
tax code), but limited the exclusion  to $5,250 per year. Since then, Congress
has continued to extend the exclusion, but on a  year-to-year basis. The
exclusion expires every September 30, however, with nearly 3,000  employers
offering Section 127 plans, and around 800,000 workers taking advantage of them,
we  anticipate another extension this year. <BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>Graduate students may no longer be eligible for this exclusion after
1996!</EM><BR>
</P>
<P>Even if your employer does reimburse you for tuition, and the reimbursement
remains a tax-free  benefit, there may be strings attached. For example, you may
have to stay with the firm for a set  number of years after you graduate, or
maintain a certain grade point average while in school. These  requirements are
only fair-after all, employers help employees with their education for the good
of  the company, not just for the good of the employee. Ford is one company that
realizes this; it pays  100% of any course approved by a boss.<BR>
</P>
<P>Still, a better program for the beginner is Cooperative Education.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Cooperative Education</STRONG></FONT><BR> Cooperative
Education combines formal studies with an off-campus job related to your major.
The  money earned on the job will, in most cases, cover college costs. In some
schools, practically the  entire student body participates in cooperative
education. Examples: Northeastern University (MA),  and GMI Engineering &amp;
Management Institute (MI). There are three common methods for rotating  between
school and work: </P>
<P><STRONG>The alternating method</STRONG>. Under this method, you are a
full-time student for a term or semester,  then you work for a term or a
semester, with the cycle repeating itself until you graduate-usually in  five
years.<BR>
<STRONG>The parallel method</STRONG>. Here you attend classes part time and
work between 15 and 25 hours a  week. You may be a student in the morning and a
worker in the afternoon, or vice versa. This  method, too, may require five
years for degree completion.<BR>
<STRONG>Extended day method</STRONG>. The student works full-time and attends
school in the evening.<BR> Employers like the co-op program, considering it, in
the Wall Street Journal's words, &quot;a source of  realistic, work-oriented,
future full-time employees.&quot;<BR> Some statistics about cooperative
education: 900 participating colleges, 50,000 participating  employers, 200,000
enrolled students who earn $1.3 billion each year. The biggest employer, 
offering the widest choice of work sites, academic plans and career fields:
Uncle Sam (over 18,000  students).</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>What's new in cooperative education?</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Uncle Sam has consolidated his various work/school programs into a single
Student Educational  Employment Program (SEEP), which has two components:<BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>The Student Temporary Employment Program</EM> which gives students the
flexibility to earn a salary  while continuing their studies. The work may be
during the summer or school year and need not be  related to the student's
academic field of study.<BR>
<EM></EM></P>
<P><EM>The Student Career Experience Program</EM> which gives students work
experience directly related  to their field of study. Students alternate formal
periods of work and study and may be eligible for  permanent employment after
graduation.</P>

Center address, call your state agency (<A HREF="ch11.html">Chapter 11</A>) and
 ask them for the information. <BR> 5. <EM>Your College</EM>. Nearly 900
colleges have cooperative education programs. If the financial aid  office
doesn't have the information you need, ask if there's a separate co-op office on
campus.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Internships</STRONG></FONT><BR> It's hard to draw the
line between cooperative education and internships. Two general distinctions: 
The alternating involvement between formal studies and work, in cooperative
education, extends  throughout a student's college career, while internships
often last only one semester or one summer  break. Participants in cooperative
education always get a paycheck; interns may or may not. In fact,  the more &quot;desirable&quot;
the internship, the less the pay. </P>

<P>Don't overlook the military as a source of financial aid. You can pick up
tuition dollars before you  enter the service, while in uniform, and after being
discharged. There are programs for active duty  personnel and programs for being
in the Reserves or the National Guard. And there are programs  for officers and
programs for enlisted people.<BR>
</P>
<P>Military tuition benefits are dispensed with no reference to financial need.
You qualify for them,  whether you are rich or poor. But they are not free. The
military will want something in return. At a  minimum you'll have to get a
haircut, salute superior officers and give a few years of your time. The  U.S.
Armed Forces have collaborated on a web site that will link you up with lots of
options, and  answer your questions (oh-so-objectively), about whether the
military is for you,

<P><FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Before Entering Service</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Military Academies</STRONG><BR> The academies are extremely
competitive. Good grades, extracurricular activities, leadership and  athletic
excellence are in demand. So are superb health and solid SAT scores. You should
have  600+ on the math portion and combined scores of 1200 or more. Contact the
academies during  your junior year of high school. Most appointments are made by
Representatives and Senators. Tell  your elected officials about your interest.
Make sure they open a file on you in their offices. Keep  feeding that file with
your achievements. Also add recommendations. Make sure you obtain 
recommendations from people who are deemed important by the elected officials.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>ROTC Scholarships</STRONG><BR> The military has one-, two- and
four-year ROTC scholarships. These scholarships will pay for  tuition, books and
fees. You will also get a small monthly allowance or a flat stipend (e.g.,
$1,000  per year). The Army offers its scholarships at three levels regardless
of actual tuition costs:  $12,800, $9,000 or $5,000 per year. In addition, each
scholarship winner receives $450 per year  for books and supplies and up to
$1,500 per year in (tax free) spending money. <BR>
</P>
<P>A 1250 SAT (28 ACT) will enhance your chances for an ROTC scholarship. So
will a varsity letter  and membership in the National Honor Society. Nearly all
scholarship winners are in the top 25%  of their HS class; Three-quarters are
class officers, and over 55% are captains of varsity athletic  teams.
Application should be made by November 1 of your senior year (the Army has an
early  application option with a July 15 deadline). There will probably be an
interview. Before the  interview, brush up on current events. Also, be prepared
to give your reasons for seeking a military  career. An interest in the physical
sciences, engineering or nursing will help.<BR>
</P>
<P>ROTC is not offered at all colleges. The services will provide you with a
list. You may use your  award at any college on that list assuming you are able
to secure admission (something you must do  on your own).</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>The Regular ROTC Program</STRONG><BR> This is not a scholarship
program. Students join the program in their freshman year, at colleges that 
offer ROTC. For two years they march and salute for free. In their junior and
senior years,  participants do get paid: $100 per month.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>ROTC-Coop Education Combination</STRONG><BR> The Army reserves
cooperative education positions for some ROTC cadets in nearby Army 
installations. These positions, which provide added earnings, will also lead to
federal employment  after the participant has served on active duty.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Military Medical Programs</STRONG><BR> See <A HREF="ch20.html">Chapter
20</A></P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>One-Shot Programs</STRONG><BR> On occasion, the Navy and the Air Force
need highly specialized technical people and will use  financial aid as a
recruiting tool. For instance, the Air Force has a &quot;College Senior Engineer
 Program&quot; for students in electrical, nuclear, astronautical and
aeronautical engineering. Students can  sign up during their junior year. In
their senior year, they will receive $1740 or $900 per month.  After graduation,
they are called to active duty, attend Officer Training School and serve as a 
commissioned officer.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>In Service Educational Benefits</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Commissioned Officer</STRONG><BR> Each year, the services select
hundreds of officers to attend graduate schools. The chosen officers  receive
full pay and allowances and have all their educational expenses met while
pursuing their  master's degree or doctorate.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Off-Duty Programs</STRONG><BR> All services have arrangements with
civilian colleges and encourage off-duty course work, with the  services paying
up to 75% of the tuition costs (amount varies with rank and length of service). 
Through credit transfers and arrangements with accrediting institutions, such
off-duty courses can be  accumulated to gain credit for associate, baccalaureate
or even master's degrees. For more  information on this and the 1000 schools
participating in the Army's Concurrent Admissions  Program (CONAP) contact
Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges, National Headquarters, One  Dupont Circle,
Suite 680, Washington DC 20036.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Reserve Duty Programs</STRONG><BR> Through the National Guard and Army
Reserves, you can receive approximately $7,124 in  (tax-free) education benefits
under the Montgomery GI Bill. That combined with good, part-time  pay as a
reservist can total $25,100 over six years. Furthermore, you can earn cash
bonuses-for  example up to $2,000 for enlistment in the reserves or completing
advanced training in the National  Guard. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Loan Repayment Options</STRONG><BR> The Army Reserve, National Guard,
and the Regular Army also offer repayment on federal student  loans (e.g.,
Stafford and Perkins). In the Army Reserve and National Guard, you may have up
to  $10,000 forgiven at the rate of 15% or $1,500 per year, whichever is
greater. As an incentive for  enlistment in selected skills, the Army will
double those amounts to $20,000 in total loans, forgiven  at the rate of 15% or
$3,000 per year, whichever is greater. In the Regular Army you may have up  to
1/3 of your loan forgiven per year of active service, to a maximum of $55,000.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>After Service benefits</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>The Montgomery GI Bill</STRONG><BR> This is a contributory system.
While on active duty, the soldier, sailor, or airman allocates $100 per  month
(to a maximum of $1,200) to an educational fund. At the end of a two-year
enlistment, the  Veteran's Administration will contribute $10,986; at the end of
a four-year enlistment the VA will  contribute $13,798. After you leave the
military, the money you earned will be paid directly to you  in monthly
installments for each month you're enrolled in college. For example, if you
enlisted for  four years and qualified for $14,998 ($13,798 + $1,200), you would
receive $416 per month for  36 months to help you pay your educational costs.
Since there are generally nine months in a school  year, this income stream
should cover you for your full four years. You have ten years to use your 
education benefits from the date of your discharge. Note: This benefit increases
each year with the  inflation rate.<BR>
</P>
<P>The Army sweetens the pot with bonuses for enlisting in what it calls
critical &quot;Military Occupation  Specialties&quot; (MOS). This could add up
to $7,813 for a two-year enlistment or $15,002 for a  four-year enlistment
bringing your total fund to $20,000 or $30,000 respectively. The Army calls 
this bonus &quot;The Army College Fund.&quot; Call 1-800-USA-ARMY for more
information. The Navy  and Marines Corps have similar benefits. Call your local
Service recruiter for more details. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Dependents Education Assistance</STRONG><BR> Wives and children of
veterans who died or were totally disabled as the result of service qualify for 
Veterans Administration educational benefits. These benefits are also extended
to dependents of  former Prisoners of War and soldiers classified as MIA-Missing
in Action.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>State Educational Benefits</STRONG><BR> Most states have aid programs
for Veterans and their dependents. See <A HREF="ch11.html">Chapter 11</A> and
write to  your state's Office of Veteran Affairs (addresses in <EM>Need A Lift</EM>).</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>BENEFITS FOR MILITARY DEPENDENTS</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Army</STRONG><BR> 1. Army Emergency Relief. Scholarships for unmarried
children of active duty, retired, or deceased  soldiers. For scholarships, apply
by March 1 to Army Emergency Relief, 200 Stovall Street,  Alexandria, VA 22332.<BR>
2. Summary of Educational Benefits. Request DA Pamphlet 352-2, Headquarters,
Department of  the Army TAPC-PDE, Washington, D. C. 20314.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Air Force</STRONG><BR> Air Force Aid Society. General Henry H. Arnold
Education Grant program ($1,000 per grant) for  dependent sons and daughters of
active duty, retired or deceased Air Force as well as spouses of  active duty
members (stationed stateside only) attending undergraduate college. Veterans and
 reservists not eligible. Approximately 5,000 grants per year. Air Force Aid
Society, Education  Assistance, 1745 Jefferson Davis Highway, Suite 202,
Arlington, VA 22202-3410,  800/429-9475. By mid-March.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Navy/Marines</STRONG><BR> Dependent's Scholarship Program for U.S.
Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard Dependents.  More than 75 Navy-oriented
organizations currently sponsor scholarships or offer aid for study  beyond the
high school level. Dependent sons and daughters of Navy, Marine Corps, Coast
Guard,  and former members are eligible for these scholarships or aid.

<EM>Need A Lift? </EM>(see below)</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Benefits for the Families of Former Military</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Former military families tend to congregate in organizations after leaving the
service. Nearly every  military association sponsors student aid programs to the
children of its members. For a  comprehensive list, obtain the useful annual
book <EM>Need a Lift?</EM> published by The American Legion,  Emblem Sales, PO
Box 1050, Indianapolis, IN 46206, $3.00, prepaid. Here are a few examples:<BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>AMVETS Memorial Scholarship<BR>
</STRONG>15 awards of $4,000 each (spread over 4 years). Applicants must be
veterans, or the son or  daughter of a veteran and must have exhausted all
government financial aid. Must also demonstrate  need and academic achievement
and be a US citizen. Must maintain a 3.0 GPA. Applications  available between
January 1 and February 15 (due by April 15). Send SASE to AMVETS  National
Headquarters, attn. Scholarships, 4647 Forbes Blvd., Lanham, MD 20706, 
301/459-9600.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Reserve Officer Association</STRONG><BR> Henry J. Reilly Memorial
Scholarships. 100 (merit-based) awards for dependents of Association  members;
25 for graduate students, 75 for undergrads. Deadlines vary from April 1 to
April 30.  For additional eligibility criteria and application request, send
SASE to Scholarship Fund, ROA,  One Constitution Avenue, NE, Washington, DC
20002.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Retired Officers Scholarship Program</STRONG><BR> Interest-free loan
program for undergraduate students who are dependent children of active, 
reserve and retired uniformed service personnel. Maximum loan: $10,000 ($2,500
per year) spread  over five years. Repayment begins three to four months after
leaving college. Recipients of this loan  are automatically considered for
several TROA sponsored grant programs. Request application by  mid-February from
Scholarship Committee, TROA, 201 N. Washington St., Alexandria, VA  22314.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>A Possible Strategy</STRONG></FONT><BR> Go on active
duty for three or four years. While on active duty, take off-duty courses (for
which the  military will pay up to 75% of the tuition costs) and make sure the
courses add up to an associate  degree. At the same time participate in the
Montgomery GI Bill. When you are ready for discharge,  you will have credit for
two years of college and a tuition kitty of nearly $15,000 (more if you were  in
the infantry) to help you pay for the last two years of college. By the time you
get your degree,  you will be one, or at the most, two years older than your
contemporaries who did not go into  service. That minor disadvantage will be
offset by somewhat greater maturity and self-confidence.  Plus, you'll probably
be free of debt.</P>
