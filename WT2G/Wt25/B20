                                   YEMEN
                           HEAVY RAINS - FLOODS
                     DHA-GENEVA SITUATION REPORT NO. 1
                               18 JUNE 1996



  1. GENERAL SITUATION:

    FROM 14 TO 16 JUNE HEAVY RAINS AND FLOODS STRUCK ALL PARTS OF
  YEMEN CAUSING EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO MANY VILLAGES, TOWNS AND CITIES
  ACROSS THE COUNTRY. FOUR GOVERNORATES, SHABWAH, HADHRAMOUT, MAREB
  AND ALJAWF WERE HEAVILY HIT AND THE GOVERNMENT OF YEMEN DECLARED
  THE ABOVE GOVERNORATES DISASTER AREAS. ACCORDING TO A DECEMBER 1994
  CENSUS, THE TOTAL POPULATION OF THESE GOVERNORATES IS 1.9 MILLION
  PEOPLE OF WHICH 65 PER CENT ARE IN RURAL AREAS. INITIAL REPORTS
  FROM THE AFFECTED AREAS INDICATE THAT THE DAMAGE WAS VERY SERIOUS.
  EIGHTY (80) PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE FLOODS AND MANY OTHERS
  INJURED. AS YET UNSPECIFIED, A LARGE NUMBER OF HOUSES WERE TOTALLY
  DESTROYED AND WIDESPREAD DAMAGE WAS CAUSED TO BUILDINGS, HOSPITALS,
  ROADS, BRIDGES, EQUIPMENT, COMMUNICATION LINES,  WATER SUPPLIES AND
  AGRICULTURAL LAND.

  2. NATIONAL RESPONSE:

    THE GOVERNMENT AND THE RED CRESCENT HAVE INITIATED IMMEDIATE
  RELIEF ASSISTANCE WITH TENTS AND BLANKETS. HOWEVER, MORE FOOD,
  MEDICAL SUPPLIES, SHELTER AND WATER TANKS ARE URGENTLY NEEDED FOR
  THE FLOOD VICTIMS. THE INJURED WERE TRANSFERRED TO HOSPITALS IN THE
  CAPITAL SANA'A. THE PRESIDENT OF YEMEN HAS IMMEDIATELY FORMED A
  MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF FOUR MINISTERS TO SURVEY THE
  DAMAGE AND REPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT WITHIN 72 HOURS. ON 17 JUNE,
  THE GOVERNMENT ISSUED AN APPEAL FOR INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN
  ASSISTANCE TO HELP THE AFFECTED POPULATION. THE UN/DHA RESIDENT
  COORDINATOR AND UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE MET WITH THE PRIME
  MINISTER OF YEMEN TODAY 18 JUNE TO DISCUSS THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE AND
  UN ASSISTANCE DURING THE EMERGENCY PHASE.

  3. COUNTRY-LEVEL INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE:

   THE UN IS COORDINATING WITH THE YEMENI GOVERNMENT AND
  INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS  A COLLECTIVE RESPONSE FOR PROVISION OF
  EMERGENCY RELIEF. A MEETING OF THE UN DISASTER MANAGEMENT TEAM
  (UN-DMT) TOOK PLACE THIS MORNING TO COORDINATE THE UN RESPONSE TO
  THE DISASTER. ANOTHER MEETING OF THE UN TEAM, INCLUDING NGOs
  PRESENT IN YEMEN, WILL TAKE PLACE LATER TODAY TO AGREE ON A PLAN OF
  ACTION FOR RAPID ASSESSMENT AND EMERGENCY RELIEF ASSISTANCE.

  4. REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE:

    URGENTLY NEEDED RELIEF ASSISTANCE INCLUDES COOKING UTENSILS,
  SANITATION, MEDICAL SUPPLIES, MOBILE WATER TANKS, SUPPLY OF CLEAN
  DRINKING WATER, FOOD, BLANKETS AND SHELTER.

  5. CHANNELS OF DELIVERY OF INTERNATIONAL AID:

    THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE CAPACITY TO DELIVER EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE
  PROVIDED BY INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE
  AND THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR/CIVIL DEFENCE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN
  THE RELIEF EFFORT. SINCE ROADS AND BRIDGES HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY
  DAMAGED OR DESTROYED, THE MENTIONED MINISTRIES ARE USING THEIR
  AIRCRAFT AND HELICOPTERS FOR SURVEYING THE AREA DAMAGED AND
  DELIVERING EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE.

  6. INTERNATIONAL PLEDGES AND CONTRIBUTIONS:

    UNDP IS IN A POSITION TO IMMEDIATELY DISBURSE US DOLLARS 50,000
  TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT OF YEMEN TO COORDINATE INTERNATIONAL
  ASSISTANCE AND TO ATTEND TO SOME OF THE RELIEF NEEDS. OTHER
  ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS CARE INTERNATIONAL, OXFAM AND SEVERAL
  EMBASSIES IN SANA'A INDICATED THAT MOBILIZATION OF ASSISTANCE IS
  UNDERWAY.

    DHA IS PREPARED TO SERVE AS CHANNEL FOR CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO BE
  USED DURING IMMEDIATE RELIEF PHASE. FUNDS ARE SPENT IN COORDINATION
  WITH RELEVANT ORGANIZATIONS OF UN SYSTEM, AND DHA PROVIDES DONOR
  GOVERNMENTS WITH WRITTEN CONFIRMATION ON UTILIZATION OF FUNDS
  CONTRIBUTED.

ETHIOPIA: AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL REPRESENTATIVE ATTENDS THE
DERGUE TRIAL

An Amnesty International delegate is visiting Ethiopia from
23 to 29 June 1996 to attend the proceedings in the ongoing
trial of 45 members of the former military government, known
as the Dergue, who are charged with genocide, war crimes and
crimes against humanity carried out between 1974 and 1991. 

      Professor Daniel Nsereko is Dean of the Faculty of Law
at the University of Botswana. He is a Ugandan citizen.

      Professor Nsereko will attend the trial proceedings as
an observer and will report his findings to the International
Executive Committee of Amnesty International. He will not be
making public statements or giving media interviews during
his visit. 

      The trial started in December 1994 with pre-trial
applications, when an earlier Amnesty International
representative was in attendance. The prosecution case, which
began in early 1996, is still at an early stage. This is the
first of a planned series of trials of over 1,500 former
officials, most of whom have been detained since 1991. The
remainder are still to be charged. The trial is being held in
the Central High Court in Addis Ababa and is expected to
continue for a long time yet.

      Amnesty International is observing this important
political trial in line with its support of a policy of ~no
impunity for human rights violators~ and in order to ensure
that the trial conforms to recognized  international
standards of fair trial. The organization has campaigned
vigorously against the persistent pattern of gross human
rights violations during the 17 year brutal dictatorship of
the Dergue and Workers Party of Ethiopia government headed by
Lieutenant- Colonel Mengistu Haile-Mariam, who is currently
in exile in Zimbabwe and being tried in absentia in the
current trial in Ethiopia.

The men named above are reported to have been arrested between 18
and 24 June 1996 on suspicion of being political opponents of the
Sudan Government. They have not been brought to court or charged and
are currently in detention in a Sudan Security-run section of Kober
Prison, Sudan's main prison located in Khartoum North. There are
reports that some of the detainees have been beaten. Amnesty
International is concerned that they are possible prisoners of
conscience and that they are at risk of ill- treatment.
 
The arrests appear to be part of a round-up of suspected opponents
of the government following a public challenge to the authorities
issued by the National Democratic Alliance, an umbrella grouping of
banned political parties and trade unions, on 10 June 1996. This
challenge, which was signed by leading political opponents living
inside Sudan, called on the government to step down in favour of an
interim administration.   
 
For further background information, see Sudan: Progress or public
relations?, AFR 54/06/96, 29 May 1996. 
 
RECOMMENDED ACTION: Please send telegrams/telexes/express/airmail
letters in English, Arabic or your own language: 
 
- expressing concern at the detention without charge of these 15
men, who may be prisoners of conscience imprisoned for their
suspected opposition to the Sudan Government; 
 
- asking assurances that they are not being ill-treated; 
 
- urging that they be given immediate and regular access to their
families, legal representatives and any necessary medical attention;
 
- appealing for them to be released if they are not to be charged
with recognizably criminal offences and brought promptly to a fair
trial.

WAR
In eastern Sudan: the Sudan Allied Forces, a group of secularist soldiers who
belong to the opposition National Democratic Alliance and are based in
Eritrea, killed six soldiers near the town of Kassala along the Eritrean
border on 19/5/96. In June a land-mine blew up a water tanker on a border
road. Ethiopia also accused Sudan of launching raids into its territory in
May.
In South Sudan: the Sudan People's Liberation Army attacked units of its
rival faction, the South Sudan Independence Army, which has recently made
peace with the Khartoum regime. The SSIA claimed that one SPLA soldier died
in the attack. Instability continues in Bahr al-Ghazal, according to the
Sudan Democratic Gazette which says that Nuer forces have been raiding
cattle, and Arab militias have been raiding for cattle and slaves in the
north of the province. Fighting between the SPLA and the government continued
- an army convoy was ambushed near Wau on 12/5/96. And some reports speak of
a mutiny of government soldiers in a garrison near Juba - their term of duty
expired three years ago but they are still at the front, with no pay for
three months.
However, one SSIA commander has signed an agreement with John Garang's SPLA
to unify forces. John Luk Jok is from the Nuer tribe, which dominates the
SSIA, and has been at odds with its leadership for over a year.

INSTABILITY AND CRUCIFIXION
Darfur is the westernmost province of Sudan, lying on the borders with Chad
whose people are mostly African [non-Arab] Muslims. The area saw great deal
of instability in the 1980's, when 7,000 were reportedly killed in acts of
lawlessness and banditry. The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army has tried
to take the war in the South to Darfur, and a previous government was
suspected of fomenting a massacre of Southerners by an Arab tribe in Darfur
in 1985. However in the 1990's the government seemed to be in control of the
area: 31,000 firearms were confiscated in 1992. Now instability is returning
- in March armed robbers killed two of the provincial governor's bodyguards
in an attack on his car, and in May a judge in Darfur sentenced six men to
hang and three men to be crucified for armed robbery. Others were sentenced
to prison terms. The gang had 85 automatic rifles in their possession when
they were arrested.
The Qur'an and Sudan's version of Islamic law allow for the crucifixion of
armed bandits.

PEACE CHARTER
A peace deal was signed in Khartoum in April between the government and two
factional rivals of the opposition Sudan People's Liberation Army - Riek
Machar's South Sudan Independence Army and the forces of Kerubino Kuanyin
Bol. Machar is now reported to be uniting his forces with government troops
at Malakal in readiness for an attack on SPLA positions at Bor, the home town
of John Garang, leader of the SPLA.
The agreement was denounced as treason by the SPLA in South Sudan and by the
exiled northerners in the opposition. Both militias were militarily
insignificant, they added. 
The government and its allies continue to press the virtues of the accord. An
SSIA spokesman in Nairobi said that the government had conceded the right of
self-determination in the South by signing it, and expected a referendum
within 24 months. And Joseph Lagu, leader of the South's liberation struggle
in the 1970's, returned to Sudan in May to back the deal. Lagu called on the
government to involve John Garang of the SPLA and his allies in the northern
opposition in the deal. The accord drew qualified approval from a
representative of the banned Umma party speaking on behalf of its leader
al-Sadiq al-Mahdi at a religious festival in Khartoum recently - this
underlines the fact that the northern opposition parties, now in alliance
with the SPLA, often see the problem of the South in terms similar to the
current northern regime. 
The government held another signing ceremony in Khartoum on 16/5/96 when
James Othow signed the peace charter on behalf of yet another rebel faction,
SPLA-United, a group based in northern Upper Nile, drawing its support from
the Shilluk tribe. The Shilluk king was also there. It is led by Lam Akol, a
leading southern intellectual who split from the SPLA in 1991. However, Lam
Akol issued a condemnation of the accord and said that Othow, a government
official since last year, had nothing to do with his movement.
The accord has greatly exacerbated tribal tensions in Sudan and elsewhere.
John Garang belongs to the Dinka tribe, which dominates the South by its
size. Machar belongs to the smaller Nuer tribe. In Kakuma refugee camp in
Kenya, where 47,000 refugees live, Nuers and Dinkas clashed in June with
clubs and spears leaving six dead, says the UNHCR. Kenyan sources say that
guns were involved, and put the number of dead at 26.

SANCTIONS
The UN imposed limited diplomatic sanctions on Sudan on 10/5/96 after it
failed to produce three men alleged to have participated in an assassination
attempt against Egypt's President Mubarak.. Since then the US, UK and Egypt
have all reduced the size of Sudanese missions in their capitals. The
Egyptians expelled 38 Sudanese diplomats.
The UN also called on the Sudanese government to stop aiding international
terrorism. President al-Bashir told an Arabic magazine in May that all
foreign opposition groups would be expelled from Sudan. His office denied the
remarks the next day, but his foreign minister told another newspaper at the
end of May that the opposition groups, like the Palestinian Islamic militant
group Hamas, would indeed be asked to leave. Hamas had said earlier it would
not be going. 
One of the many larger than life characters in Sudan is Osama bin Laden, a
billionaire of Saudi origin who is believed to bankroll many of the Islamic
militant groups in the world. He fought fearlessly in the Afghan war and then
went to live in Sudan after he was expelled from Saudi Arabia for criticising
the corruption of the regime. His fate is not known at the moment - the
Sudanese foreign minister says he left Sudan for Afghanistan of his own
accord; his UN ambassador says he was expelled; other sources say that there
is a deal to deport him in return for Saudi oil. 
Sudan reportedly set up informal contacts with its arch enemy Israel last
month, presumably to discuss its relations with Hamas. Sudan's support for
such militant groups deeply agitates its neighbours - the Egyptian government
hanged six Muslim militants last month who had been trained in Sudan.

OTHER NEWS
IMF talks: Sudan's $1.7 billion arrears on repayments due to the
International Monetary Fund were the subject of talks in Khartoum in May.
Sudan was almost expelled from the organisation last year for its arrears,
but saved its membership by agreeing to make token repayments of $4 million a
month. It has not been keeping up with these. Government newspapers in
Khartoum said agreement had been reached, but this was denied by anonymous
IMF sources. (Reuter 15/5/96)

Teachers to be expelled: Yemen will reduce by 25% the number of expatriate
teachers employed by its ministry of education. This will affect 1,500
Sudanese teachers in Yemen. Sudan's government has promised jobs to any
teachers obliged to return. (SUNA 18/5/96)

Oil: Arakis, the Canadian company drilling for petroleum in Upper Nile, says
one well under development will produce 4,500 barrels a day, making it the
company's most productive well in the world. The Energy and Mining minister,
on a visit to Tehran, discussed the possibility of Iranian help in building
an oil refinery in Khartoum. Southern Sudanese have long rejected all
attempts by Northern government to control the oil wealth of their region.
Meanwhile, President al-Bashir promised that June will see the first Sudanese
produced petrol. (Reuter 22/5/96, 23/5/96; al-Sharq al-Awsat 28/5/96)

Inflation up, earnings down: Inflation reached 83% in Sudan in April, up from
71% in December. Sudan earned $120 million from its exports in the first
quarter of 1996 - 55% less than was anticipated by last year's budget. (Sudan
News and Views 6/96)

Operations cancelled: Sudan's largest hospital closed its surgical theatres
after six women died in operations in May. The Khartoum Hospital had earlier
closed its dialysis unit, and its morgue cannot take any more bodies because
there is no money for burials. (Sudan News and Views 6/96)

Yes it hurt, No it didn't work: The current regime in Sudan will celebrate
seven years of power this month but President al-Bashir admitted to a London
newspaper that the economy could do better - he is thinking of holding an
economic conference to revise government policy. (al-Hayat 23/5/96)

Children protest: Sudanese children on Sunday marched through Khartoum and
handed a memorandum to the United Nations to protest against sanctions it
imposed on Sudan in May. War orphans and others chanted "We will never
succumb, nor are we going to be humiliated or yield to the Americans. Oh
United Nations, Sudan is deeply rooted in our hearts. No to the diplomatic
sanctions against the Sudan". (Reuter 26/5/96)

Purges forgotten: 124 diplomats, teachers and journalists who lost their jobs
after the current regime took power in 1989 were reinstated in May, while 582
others had their pensions enhanced. 63 others had been reinstated by February
of this year. The government has taken several measures to broaden its
support and include any members of the opposition prepared to accept its
supremacy. It has dismissed 75,000 employees since 1990, says the Sudan Human
Rights Organisation. (Reuter 22/5/96; SHRO 4/96)

Jailbreak: An independent Khartoum newspaper reported on 17/5/96 that 95
prisoners in a prison 120 miles south of Khartoum briefly took control of
their prison after exchanging fire with warders. The men were all detained in
connexion with an alleged coup attempt in March. The next day a police
spokesman dismissed the affair as a minor incident, but the regime suspended
the publication of the newspaper, al-Ray al-Akher. Unidentified armed men
visited its offices, threatened a janitor and took away 20,000 copies of the
paper. Everyone assumed it was the security forces. (Reuter 17/5/96, 20/5/96;
ca was the target of a campaign by the Dutch-based justice and peace group
Pax Christi last year - the group wanted an end to arms supplies for the
Sudanese regime. (UPI 11/5/96)

Cholera Epidemic: 700 people were killed in a cholera epidemic which has
spread northwards from Adok in western Upper Nile to Ler, Leek and Jikany.
Cholera has also been identified in northern Bahr al-Ghazal, and acute
diarrhoea in Juba. These reports come from Medecins sans Frontieres, an
international aid agency working in Sudan, which fears that the present rainy
season will isolate people from medical help. 
The reports were denied by Khartoum's Ministry of Health, which said that
they were aimed at "tarnishing the image of Sudan abroad". A senior official
there said that 10 medical teams despatched to all parts of the country had
found no evidence to support the aid agency's fears.

Neighbours from Hell: A family in Hounslow, London, who led a three year
campaign of abuse, intimidation, arson and stabbing against the black and
Asian residents of their housing scheme were evicted for racial harassment
last month after one of their neighbours reported them to the local council.
A father of two from Southern Sudan spoke out against them and was forced to
spend last Christmas on somebody's floor. When asked how he had found the
courage to stand up to the racial hatred, he said: "I have lived with civil
war for 17 years. I am not scared as I hold my life in my hands." (Hounslow
and London Recorder 17/5/96)

HUMAN RIGHTS
Two highly critical reports on the human rights situation in the Sudan were
published at the end of May. Amnesty International, which led a major
campaign against human rights abuses in Sudan last year, said that the policy
of brutality against the opposition has continued, although the government
had made minor concessions in 1995. Amnesty repeated its call for the
international community to set up a human rights monitoring operation for
Sudan. 
A longer report  from Human Rights Watch in New York entitled Behind the Red
Line : Political Repression in Sudan, details the denial of basic freedoms of
speech, assembly and association, combined with the threat of arbitrary
arrest, detention and torture by an ever-present security apparatus, as well
as abuses committed in the course of the war. The report is based on two
missions to Sudan in 1995, and contains detailed recommendations to the
government and others. 
The two reports press the allegation that Sudan tolerates or encourages the
slave trade - the government has long denied this in tones of outraged
dignity. However, the minister of justice announced last month that a
committee would be set up to investigate the claim. Its members appear too
have been drawn exclusively from the security forces.

HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN
The Geneva based OMCT/SOS Torture said on 30/5/96 that four people detained
in Kober prison were released on 26/5/96: Mr  Elsir Osman Babu, politician;
Mr Sir Elkhtim Osman Alhag, politician; Mr
Mutwakil Hag Hamed and Mr Noor Sharaf Eldin, farmer. 32 others are still in
detention, among them Mr  Mohmed Hussain Ali a 14 year old student.
SOS-Torture is very concerned for the safety of Dr. Sati Gah-ElRasoul, Mr
Ismail Mahadeen and Mr Moneir ElBaru, who were arrested, presumably without
charge, on 26 May 1996 and are currently being detained at Kober Prison. They
ask that appeals be sent to the Sudanese authorities on behalf of the men,
asking that they be released immediately if they are being detained without
charge. If valid charges are held against them, they should be brought
promptly to a fair trial. Please address appeals to: His Excellency
Lieutenant General Omar Hassan al-Bashir, President of the Republic, People's
Palace, PO Box 281, Khartoum, Sudan.

WRESTLERS FOR GOD - A NUBA THEOLOGY OF LIBERATION
by Renato Kizito Sesana - see end of article for copyright
The Nuba mountains in the centre of Sudan are the scene of some of the worst
atrocities in the current civil war. Here, a Roman Catholic priest who
visited the mountains recently writes how the trials of the Nuba affect their
vision of God's presence with them, in their ancient culture and in their
hopes for the future. One of the most famous of Nuba traditions is the
wrestling matches in the villages ... 
Luka, a lanky 15 year old, has accompanied me during many long exhausting
trips on foot. He carried my luggage on a shoulder and a machine-gun on the
other. In every village we visited he had some friends to pray with first,
and to be riotously happy with after. One day after having walked for hours
under the sun and then having helped to dig a grave, he joined the team of
local wrestlers in challenging those from up the Moro Hills. He engaged in
the wrestling three times, losing each time to older and stronger opponents.
Every time he lost he smiled and complimented the winner. At the end, as he
was lifting from the ground the luggage and the machine-gun for two more
hours of walking, he told me smiling: "Abuna (father), did you enjoy the
wrestling? Sometime in the future I'll be strong enough to win!". Then he
smiled, exposing the holes where some of the front teeth had been removed in
the initiation to manhood, and said: "The same with the government. Soon,
with the help of God, we will be strong enough to wrestle them to the
ground!".
The confidence of Luka might prove to be too optimistic. During my first
visit to the Nuba in the beginning of August 1995, I met William "Shaker"
Kuali, 26, an SPLA freedom fighter and musician. When Shaker started playing
his guitar and singing his melodies nobody could resist smiling and dancing.
And when he joined the wrestling arena the public was all for him. Shaker
told me about his love for singing and writing poetry, and of his
determination that Sudan be a place where all people of different religions
and culture could live in harmony. "My place is here to fight for a better
tomorrow" he said, but he expressed also his ardent desire that the war would
end soon. I learned when I went back to the Nuba in December that Shaker will
never sing again his songs of hope, freedom and love. Just a few days after
we met, August 18th, he was gunned down by government soldiers while
defending his home village. 
Honey from the Rock: If wrestling is the symbol of the indomitable resistance
of the Nuba, there is another symbol properly depicting their soul. "I will
satisfy you with the wild rock honey", God promises to his people in Psalm
81:16. Why wild rock honey? I asked myself this question many times when the
Nuba offered me wild rock honey as the best treat you can find in their
Mountains. It is really the best honey I ever tasted. The honey from the rock
of the Nuba Mountains is a proper image for the delicate feelings of the
Nuba. I have never received such generous hospitality as in Sudan. The Nuba
routinely surprise me with gifts of beautifully decorated gourds, bead
necklaces and hand carved crosses. People have thanked me in endless personal
ways for my visits. A Protestant pastor broke down in tears when we had to
part ways after a few days of walking together. The Nuba are people who value
friendship. Happy are those who receive the honey of their friendship. 
Their struggle, like everything in their life, has a strong communitarian
aspect. In the Nuba community all participate.  There are no superstars. At
the market, during the dancing, the liturgy, or the wrestling competition the
participation of each person is total, at whatever level of involvement in
the action. Christmas night was moonless. In the vast yard around the little
c like becoming part of one body. It was a unique Nuba way of expressing
their joy and faith in Jesus. "I have no longer any doubt - I told them -
Christ is a Nuba. I have seen Him in your generous love for the Church, in
your faith, in the eyes of your children, in your dances. Christ is
definitely a Nuba." 
Liberation and Inculturation: It would be good to be able to express the
faith of the Nuba people in a Nuba way; to write a Nuba theology starting
from the experience of oppression, Africaness, culture, liberation and faith
of the Nuba people. A prominent feature of the Nuba people is that in their
present experience, struggle for liberation and faith in God intersect. Their
own human liberation and the defence of their culture become the reason and
sustenance of their struggle. Christ meets them at this junction. The
liberation theology which emerged in Latin America during the turmoil of the
sixties proclaimed a faith centred concept of integral liberation to the
oppressed. African theology instead started from culture and developed the
idea of inculturation. Now there are signs that the two theologies of
liberation and inculturation are going to meet and proclaim a liberation
rooted in inculturated faith. 
To an evangelizing Catholic Church struggling to shed its ethnocentric roots,
to overcome its own long history of cultural oppression and persecution, and
to align itself with all those who hunger for justice, the Nuba offer a very
special gift. The Nuba Christ is crucified on a cross where the vertical beam
represents the thrust for liberation, a liberation which transcends the
economic and political to reach divinization. The horizontal beam represents
the reaching out to culture, to the people in their concrete way of life. In
the eyes of the world the Nuba are crucified on a cross of degrading misery
and backward culture. Yet the same cross, in their hands, becomes an
instrument of salvation, redemption and resurrection, a new way of life where
human dignity and faith in God are one. Evangelization of the Nuba means to
enter into this double dynamic of inculturation and liberation.

POLICE FOIL KILLING, ROBBERY ATTEMPT

Addis Abeba (ENA) - A statement issued Friday by the
Investigation Coordination Department of the Police
Force Central Bureau said police has foiled the
conspiracy of a clandestine organization to assassinate
high government officials, renowed individuals and
foreigners especially American citizens.

The alleged members of the illegal, underground organization
including its chaairman Dr. Taye Wolde-Semayat and deputy chairman and
economic affairs head Seleshi Berhane as well as other members have been put
under police custody following the abortive attempt, the statement said.

It said rather than organizing peacefully and carrying out legal and peaceful
political work, the illigal organization has been undertaking until early 1995
extensive activity following the insurructionist path to establish an
underground organization initially under the name "Ethiopian Unity Patriots
Front".

Following is the full text of the statement.

According to the constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia,
every citizen has the right to subscribe to the political view of his choice,
to organize freely and in accordance with the law and regulations to move
throughout the country to mobilize supporters and to protest in a peaceful
manner. This right has been exercised in full since the beginning of the
transition period when it was inscribed in the Charter. This right is
respected today with a greater constitutional guarantee following the adoption
of the Constitution which was produced with the participation of all the
peoples of our country.

Whereas the democratic rights of citizens and peoples are constitutionally
guaranteed, their implementation can only succeed when all citizens exercise
their rights in a lawful and orderly manner. The fact that during the
transition period and since then, political parties were established and
succeeded in functioning legally, and that citizens began to extensively
exercise their democratic rights is a proof of this reality. As has been seen
to date, all measures taken by the government, from ensuring peace and
stability to the establishment of democratic structures to promote the
exercise of democratic rights emanate from the Government's desire to provide
proper legal protection for the democratic activities of citizens and
political parties.

While the activities of political parties that are carried out in a peaceful
and lawful manner need to be protected and encouraged, it is the duty and
responsibility of the law enforcement bodies of the government to protect
against illigal activities aimed at destroying by force the peaceful and
democratic order achieved through sacrifice, and to take legal action if such
activity has indeed taken place.

In this regard, the Investigation Coordinating Department of the Police Force
Central Bureau has began a legal investigation into an illigal organization
that is bent disrupting the peace of the land, destabilizing the democratic
process and furthermore formenting disorder and terror. As soon as the
investigations initiated by the department are complete, the matter will be
brought to the attention of the relevant bodies for their decision.

The matter that is being examined by the Investigation Coordination Department
of the Police Force Central Bureau is the following. As referred to earlier,
rather than organize peacefully and carry out legal and peaceful political
work, until early 1995 extensive activity has been undertaken following the
insurrectionist path to establish an underground organization initially under
the name " "Ethiopian Unity Patriots Front" and a short time later under the
name "Ethiopian National Patriots Front". Among those that initiated and
organized this movement are included:

       1. Dr. Taye Woldesemayat
       2. Ato Sileshi Berhane  and three other collabrators

These persons and their collaborators who chose to embark on this illegal and
destructive path carried out secret meetings in Addis Abeba and after
elaborating the organiztion's programme, elected among themselves Dr. Taye
Woldesemayat as Chairman, Ato Sileshi Berhane as Deputy and responsible for
Economic Affairs, and other for military responsibilities. Following a plan to
implement the programme of their underground organization, they took various
measures giving priority to identifying sources of income, securing weapons
and recruting former military officers to carry out military duties.
Accordingly,

1. Regarding sources of Income:

   The organization, for financing its illegal activities
   has decided to follow the method of forcing people especially wealthy
individuals to pay contribution as wll as robbing,by forceful means,
governmental and private business institutions.

2. Regarding Arms:

   In order to fulfil the plans of the organization the first option was to
collect arms through purchase and in this regard a launcher and an Uzi rifle
with their ordinances were captured. Moreover, to caryout their activities
they have stockpiled different types of armaments in Eastern Gojjam wher they
were captured.

3. Recruitment:

   As indicated above, in order to increase its source of income through
robbery and to be able to use the arms that were acquired former army officers
namely: . Capitain Moges Assefa . Lieutenant Chane Tolla Teffera and . Dagne (
Targeta Leuel ) were recruited and    issued weapons. The Ethiopian National
Patriotic Front,    as it was initially established in a clandestine manner,
conspired  and planned to carry out terrorist activity    especially in Addis
Abeba to augument its income through    robbery, to assassinate high
government officials and    renowned individuals as well as foreigners and
especially American citizens. This conspirecy was foiled befor it was executed
and Sileshi Berhane escaped arrest while Lieutenant Chane Tolla Teffera was
arrested after an encounter with security officers and after causing a slight
injury on a policeman with the rifle issued to him by the organization.

Others are under detention pending investigation of their case in accordance
with the criminal code.

In connection with this clandestine plot, Gebre Tsadik Haile Mariam, the
person who was involved as a coordinator, laison man and organizer was
aprehended concealing an Uzi rifle and numerous bullets. He is currently under
investigation along with his accomplices.

According to the results of the investigation obtained <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> far, Gebre Tsadik
Haile Mariam  has deployed in 1987 Ethiopian calander a team of this illegal
organization to throw grenades on the premises of the American Government Aid
Agency USAID, located near the Bole Road. Moreover it has also been
ascertained that in 1985 Ethiopian calander an attempt was carried out to
murder an American employee of the USAID.

The Department of Investigation Coordination of the Central Police will
submit, through the Federal Attorney's Office the case to the appropriate
court as soon as the investigation on the alleged criminals is completed.

  02 JUL 96 - SUDAN-SECURITY
  
Sudanese Security Forces on Alert at Eritrea Border

   
   
   KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Sudanese security personnel have been
   dispatched to Tokker in the country's east, on the border with
   Eritrea, where two landmines have reportedly injured a number of
   people.
   
   The mines are believed to have been planted by an Eritrea-based group
   opposed to the Sudanese government.
   
   Eritrea has accused Sudan of training dissidents seeking to oust
   president Essaias Afwerki. Khartoum has denied any wrong doing.
   
   Reporting the incident Tuesday, an independent daily quoted the
   eastern Sudan province commissioner, Abdel Rahman Balal, as saying "a
   large number" of civilians had volunteered to take up arms to protect
   their country against any armed incursion.
   
   The commissioner, however, told the daily that the Sudanese forces
   would not launch "any aggression against the Eritrean people." He
   described relations between the two countries as "intimate".
   
   Meanwhile, the governor of the Red Sea State, Badawi el-Khair Idris,
   has told the visiting Sudanese Vice-President, Gen. George Kongor
   Arop, measures had been take to contain the disquiet created by the
   landmine explosions in Tokker.
   
   The Red Sea State borders Eritrea in the south and Egypt on the
   extreme north.
   
   Sudan and Egypt have both claimed ownership of the Halaib triangle on
   their common border for the last four years. At least three Sudanese
   soldiers were killed at the height of the crisis when Egypt massed
   thousands of troops in the area.

           and 23 other men (names unknown)
 
The seven men named above are among 30 men reported to have been
arrested on or around 23 June 1996 in Wad Medani, Sudan's second
city, which is located approximately 250 kilometres southeast of
Khartoum in an area known as the Gezira.  They have not been brought
to court or charged and are currently reported to be undergoing
intensive interrogation in two Sudan Security detention centres, the
first in Barakat, eight miles south of Wad Medani, and the second
in Wad Medani town itself. Relatives are reported to have been
denied access.  Amnesty International is concerned that the men are
possible prisoners of conscience and that they are at risk of ill-
treatment.
 
The arrests are part of a round-up of suspected opponents of the
government following a public statement by supporters of the banned
National Democratic Alliance (NDA), an umbrella grouping of banned
political parties and trade unions, issued in Wad Medani in
mid-June. al-Kheir Ali Arbab and Abdeen Miheisi, who is a diabetic,
are reported to have signed the statement on behalf of the Doctors'
Union and Engineers' Union respectively. Some of the other men are
former prominent trade unionists or left-wing activists.
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
 
There were a succession of public challenges to the government by
the NDA in various cities in Sudan in June 1996. A public statement
by the NDA, signed by leading political opponents living inside
Sudan and issued in Khartoum on 10 June, called on the government
to step down in favour of an interim administration.  This was
followed by at least 15 arrests of suspected political opponents who
remain in detention (see UA 157/96, AFR 54/12/96, 28 June 1996).  
   
 
For further background information, see Sudan: Progress or public
relations?, AFR 54/06/96, 29 May 1996. 
 
RECOMMENDED ACTION: Please send telegrams/telexes/express/airmail
letters in English, Arabic or your own language: 
 
- expressing concern at the detention without charge of 30 men
(naming some or all of the seven) arrested in Wad Medani on or
around 23 June 1996, who may be prisoners of conscience imprisoned
for their suspected opposition to the Sudan Government; 
 
- asking assurances that they are not being ill-treated; 
 
- urging that they be given immediate and regular access to their
families, legal representatives and also to any necessary medical
attention, particularly Abdeen Miheisi, who is a diabetic; 
 
- appealing for them to be released if they are not to be charged
with recognizably criminal offences and brought promptly to a fair
trial.

ONGOING CONFLICTS

1. Afghanistan -- President  Burhanuddin Rabbani is the
leader of Shi'ite Jamait Islami party and is supported by
the forces of Admad Shah Massoud. 

Hostilities began in the spring of 1978 when Marxist
conspirators overthrew the Afghan president and war broke
out when the Soviets invaded in December 1979. (The U.S.
spent more than $5 billion supporting the anti-Soviet
forces.) The Soviets withdrew in the spring of 1989. The
puppet Communist government that remained fell in April 92
giving way to a new civil war between rival Muslim groups

The population of Afghanistan was 15.5 million in the last
census before the Communist takeover.  At least 1 million
have been killed and 2 million displaced from their homes
to other towns and cities of Afghanistan. 6 million others
have been driven across the borders to Pakistan and Iran.
Less than half the refugees have returned since the end of
Communist rule in 1992. About 2 million others, according
to international relief agencies, have been permanently
disabled.

In January 1995, an Islamic militia, known as Taliban,
apparently supported by Pakistan, appeared, and by March
1995 controlled about half the country. 

The siege of Kabul (pop. 1.2 million) began in Jan 94 by
Taliban forces, mostly Sunni Pushtuns, the majority ethnic
group that has traditionally provided Afghanistan's rulers.
 The Kabul government is dominated by pro-Iranian Shi'ite,
ethnic Tajiks, a minority in Afghanistan.  The civilian
toll in Kabul has been estimated at least 25,000 by the
International Committee of the Red Cross and at least
45,000 by the government. In comparison, 10,000 to 15,000
people are said to have died during the 40 months of
Serbian bombing of Sarajevo that ended in the fall of 1995.

A relief effort by the United States Agency for
International Development ended in 1994 and American aid
channeled  through the United Nations and other relief
groups has fallen to between $40 million and $60 million a
year. (NYT, 16 Oct. 95 and 5 February 1996, John Burns).  

Iran fears  that the Taliban wish to establish a base for
anti-Iranian operations from Afghanistan. Saudi Arabia and
the United States are also backing the Taliban forces
because they want to contain Kabul government of President
Rabbani (IPS, November 95).  

Main Arms Suppliers: Pakistan, USA, USSR

2. Bosnia: "Violence Flares As Bosnians Try to Regain 
Prewar Homes," by Mike O'Conner (NYT, 22 April 96)

During the war, an estimated 2.4 million Bosnians were
forced from their homes; virtually none have returned.
Neither the major foreign peacekeeping authorities nor
Bosnian officials have been able to solve the problem. 
The issue is explosive, say NATO and UN officials.

Crowds of Serbs moved on Muslims trying to reach the town
of Bosan Novi and Doboj in Bosnian Serb territory and
Croats were attacked by Serbs near Modrika.

"Most of the houses to which refugees want to return are
now occupied by refugees of another ethnic group.  They
feel they will be displaced if the refugees return and --
because they are not being allowed to return to their
homes either -- they will have no place to live."

2. Burma (Myanmar) : Correction: Popular leader Aung San
Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won the
presidency in 1990 with over 61% of the popular vote,
giving her party 80% of the seats in parliament. 

Burma: 

Human Rights Abuses and Destruction of Karen Lands

A cross-country gas pipeline has been constructed across
Karen lands north of Tavoy, Burma, in order to transport
gas to Thailand from huge gas fields which have been
discovered beneath Burma's Andaman Sea. To protect the
pipeline from rebel attacks, the Burmese military has
turned the areas surrounding the pipeline into a free fire
zone where villagers are either shot on sight, or rounded
up into forced labor camps, or forced to flee to Thailand.

The military regime in Burma, known as SLORC, is in
business with Unocal gas and oil company and stands to
make $400 million annually beginning in 1998 in profits
from the pipeline.

(Documentary by International Dispatch, 1996; and letter
by Tyler R. Giannini, Co-Director, EarthRights
International, in In These Times, 13 May 1996).

3. Burundi -- More than 100,000 people have died in the 
conflict which began in October 1993 pitting the Tutsi
dominated military against the Hutu rebels with civilians
and refugees caught in the middle (NYT, Reuters, 24
November '95).  15,000 dead in 1995 (Time Magazine, Andrew
Purvis, 2.5.96). 

The low-level civil war began in 1993 when Tutsi soldiers
assassinated Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu and the country's
first democratically elected president after he threatened
to bring an end to 30 year s of Tutsi domination. 50,000
died in 1993 alone. Since 1993, 250,000 Burundians, mostly
Hutu have escaped into Zaire and Tanzania, adding to
nearly 2 million Rwandan refugees.  In January 1995, 20,0
00 Rwandan Hutu managed to flee the Burundian fighting to
the Tanzania border.  There are an additional 130,000
Rwandan Hutu still in Burundi (Time Magazine, Andrew
Purvis, 2.5.96). 

According to a NYT story by James C. McKinley Jr. (2.7.96)
there are 1.7 million Rwandan Hutu refugees in 59 camps in
Tanzania, Zaire and Burundi.

Fierce clashes between the Burundi army and Hutu rebels
erupted in December 1995 in the capital, Bujumbura.
Amnesty International  believes that attacks by Tutsi
dominated security forces in the capital are aimed at
ridding Bujumbura of Hutu.  In addition, armed Hutu groups
are responding by killing ethnic Tutsi. 

According to Amnesty International (AI) there are about
1,000 casualties per month; and there have been more than
1,300 dead since the start of November 1995.   AI believes
that there are unreported massacres in the inaccessible
provinces of Bubanza and Cititoke where fighting has

5. India and Pakistan and Kashmir

Indian government vs. Muslim separatist rebel groups who
use various methods in order to gain their aims, which
range from gaining the referendum on autonomy which was
promised as far back as 1950, limited autonomy in
confederation with India, a completely independent Kashmir
(Islamic or secular) or merger with Pakistan.

Some of these groups are sponsored by Pakistan, some by   
 Iran or the Gulf states and others seem to be made up
largely of displaced ex-Mujahadeen from the Afghanistan/
Pakistan border areas.

One of these groups, a very minor one called Al-Faran,
gained much publicity in 1995 due to its taking of Western
hostages. (According to an unconfirmed report in the New
York Times (5.16.96) the group killed their remaining four
hostages) Other groups, such as the largest one JKLF -
Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front, are engaged in regular
full scale actions against Indian army formations and seem
to enjoy wide popular support among the Kashmiris.

Some observers have argued that the best ally of the
central government are the various groups themselves, as
much of their energy seems to be expended in fighting each
other. (Michael Strutt, special to DESIP)

6. Iran: Date of Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Salmon 
Rushdie: February 14, 1989.

7. Liberia -- War began in 1989 when forces led by Charles
Taylor invaded from the Ivory Coast and overthrew the
regime of Sgt. Doe who had violently ousted the
Americo-Liberian elite in 1980 and was widely considered
one of the modern Africa's most corrupt and brutal
figures. By the time of the shaky cease-fire of August
1995, 150,000 Liberians were killed by 5 warring factions.
3/4 of Liberia' s population are refugees -- one-half in
capital Monrovia, and one-third in neighboring countries:
(mid-1993 population estimate: 2.8 million).

Fighting re-erupted towards the end of 1995 between the
forces of Charles Taylor and Mr. Kroma, the leader of
another faction.

As 1996 began, dozens of people were killed in the worst
fighting since the August cease-fire.  The clashes have
sent 80,000 people fleeing into Tubmanborg. Liberia's
diamond-rich northwestern region is controlled by rebels of
the ethnic Krahn branch of the United Liberation Movement
called Ulimo-J, led by General Roosevelt Johnson. Members
of the 7,000 troop peacekeepers of the Economic Community
of West African States (Ecomog) have been taken hostage by
rebel forces.  They were spread out across Liberia to
prepare for the disarmament of 60,000 combatants, a key
component of the cease-fire (AP, in NYT, 1.4.96).

* from a NYT report by Howard W. French (2.1.96)  "After 
Years of War, a Lawless Liberia"
"The arrival of a regional peacekeeping force [in 1991?]
dominated by Nigeria, and the later deployment of hundreds
of United Nations officials here, from military observers
to relief experts, did no thing to reduce corruption.

"West African peacekeepers, unsatisfied with hefty cuts
they took on all rebel sold goods moving through the
country's ports, were soon stripping the country of
everything from railroad stock to street lamps.  And
United Nations workers here say unscrupulous United
Nations officials have been making a killing on everything
from real estate deals to procurement kickbacks...."

"A recent outbreak of serious fighting between one armed
group, the Ulimo-J militia, and the West African
peacekeepers appears to be driven by diverging interest
over the question of who controls luc rative illicit
diamond mining in an area just north of the capital."

from a  NYT report: 24 April 96 by Howard W. French
Headline: "In a Calm of Sorts, Liberians Ventured Out in 
Shattered Capital"

Pullquote: "Boy soldiers roam Monrovia feeling empowered"

"... Monrovia today is a place where zones of influence of 
rival warlords come dangerously close and unpredictably 
into contact...It was far too early to say whether any of the many players in this c
ountry's crisis possesses a big enough stick to impose a 
sturdy peace....

"Tens of thousands of Monrovians have fled for refuge in
outlying areas like Bushrod Island, to the houses of
friends and relatives, in open lots and near makeshift
international feeding centers...

Food shortage: Jailee Quiee, a 40 year old `block leader'
said: "It's been a week since anyone around here has had
any rice."

Casualties of recent fighting: City officials have
estimated that at least 200 people, mostly civilians, have
been killed here since the fighting broke out two weeks
ago.

Thousands of tons of donated wheat and oil are available
at Monrovia's docks, but UN officials said food aid was
held up this morning by fighters of the United Liberation
Movement, an ally of Mr. Tay lor's force.  "The scene was a
repetition of what has happened here hundreds of times
since the fighting began, as teen-age warriors rob
ordinary citizens of their food at gunpoint, often
shooting those who complain too much."

CHINA: Demographic and grain production report from Calypso 
Log, February 1996.

Population 1995: 1.23 billion; 55 ethnic minorities;
Population growth reduction campaign began in the 70s. In
1970 the fertility rate (the number of children born per
number of women of reproductive age) was 5.8.  By 1980 the
rate had dropped to 2.85.  And since 1992, it has
continued to fall to an estimated 2.0.  

65% (800 million) of the Chinese are under the age of 35
and the population increases at the rate of 13 million
people a year.

Population aging.  According to some forecasts, in 40
years there may be more persons over the age of 65 in
China than in all the developed countries combined.  How
will the Chinese deal with this ever-increasing number of
older persons, while the number of working-age people is
dropping proportionally?

China's single child policy leads to gender imbalance.  
There is a lack of almost 50 million women.

FOOD PRODUCTION IN CHINA

"Grain production has stagnated at 445 million tons while
demand is skyrocketing as the Chinese population grows, has
increased wealth, and seeks improved diets.  Once a grain
exporter (8 million ton s in 1992), China has had to import
16 million tons annually since 1994.  This change is all
the more alarming because soil erosion  -- due in part to
increased deforestation which, since 1949, has stripped
one-third of the country's forests and woodlands -- and
the thrust toward urbanization have swallowed up 12 million
square kilometers of arable land in the past 50 years. 
Combined with demographic growth, this represent a 50
percent reduction in available farmland for every
inhabitant!  The return to private land ownership has also
had negative effects, as millions of peasants were no
longer needed to work the farmlands.  One hundred fifty
million jobless peasants have already fled to the cities,
despite very strict measures to control migration between
provinces."

HUMAN RIGHTS -- Asia

Child Prostitution

from "Asian Childhoods Sacrificed to Prosperity's Lust" by 
Nicholas Kristoff, NYT, 14 April 1996

According to estimates by social workers and government
officials, more than a million girls and boys aged 17 and
younger are engaged in prostitution in Asia. Rising
economic development and the fear of AIDS which is driving
customers to younger boys and girls are aggravating the
problem. 

AIDS is spreading rapidly in the area.  India had its
first AIDS case in 1986, yet already some 1.6 million
Indians are infected with HIV.  Thailand has 800,000
cases; Myanmar (Burma) where condoms are banned has
400,000 cases.  In Cambodia, 39% of prostitutes are
infected with HIV.

HUMAN RIGHTS -- Africa, Middle East, United States

Female Genital Mutilation

According to a column by Ellen Goodman reprinted from the
Boston Globe in Liberal Opinion Week (30 October 95),
Female Genital Mutilation is increasingly becoming a
phenomenon in immigrant communitie s in the United States.
Estimates of cases range from the hundreds to the
thousands.  Only three states, New York, Minnesota and
North Dakota have made FGM on minors a felony while it is
illegal in E ngland, Sweden and much of Europe.  

Estimates are that somewhere between 100 million and 130
million women worldwide undergo the practice. It is the
fate of nearly every woman and girl in Somalia, 90 percent
of the females in Ethiopia and half in Egypt [some
estimates put the figure for Egyptian women as high as 90%
--ed.]

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

Roadbuilding in the Pacific Northwest

from "Roads Take Toll" by John C. Ryan with research by
Chandra Shah, reprinted in Earth First! Journal, February
1996 (Brigid), courtesy of Northwest Environment Watch
 nwatch@igc.apc.org 

The Pacific Northwest encompasses most of BC, Idaho,
Oregon, Washington, southeastern Alaska, northwestern
California, and western Montana.

In a striking illustration of the increase in two-wheel
drive roads in the Kootenay Mountains in BC, an
accompanying map shows that in 1952, about 80% of the
mountains were unmarked; while in 1986 more than 85% of
the same area was covered by such roads. 

In Oregon, Washington and western Montana, roads have
surpassed streams as a defining feature of the landscape.
Roads built for logging as well as driving threaten the
Northwest's natural heritage, " from ceders to salmon,
salamanders to grizzly bears.  Roads harm the environment
by degrading and polluting nearby streams, dividing
wildlife habitats into small fragments, and spreading
exotic species...

"Impervious surfaces like pavement collect and concentrate
water and toxins. Because water runs immediately off
pavement rather than soaking into the ground, roads often
lower groundwater tables and destabilize nearby
waterways...Studies in the Seattle area show [a decline
in] stream channel stability, fish habitat quality, and
salmon and amphibian populations if even 10-15 percent of
a watershe d is covered by impervious surfaces...

"Heavy metals and hydrocarbons emitted or leaked from cars
-- along with road salt and roadside herbicides -- run off
roads and into adjacent waterways...Roads built for
logging degrade forests befor e any trees are cut. Erosion
and sedimentation, often in massive landslides, are
inescapable by-products of road building in steep terrain;
sedimentation is particularly harmful to salmon.  In Idaho
and Oregon, forest roads have caused erosion at least 100
times greater than natural rates. Even as roads block the
movement of many native species, they open remote areas to
hunters, exotic weeds, a nd diseases. Port Orford cedar, a
highly prized tree found only in southwestern Oregon and
northwestern  California, is endangered by a root-rot
fungus that is spread along logging roads."

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY

"Anti-Iran fever"
from Middle East International, 2 Feb 96, by Donald Neff

"...a major influence on Washington's [anti-Iran] policy
is Israel.  It has been inflaming U.S. policy against Iran
for years, and especially since President Clinton came to
power in 1993. In the mon ths before the passage of the new
directive [ordering the CIA to launch an $18 million cover
action programme against Iran], AIPAC, the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee, was busy lobbying Con gress to
take tough action against Iran.  Its efforts have been
highly successful.  Now that Israel is gaining peace with
its Arab neighbors, its strategic perspective has grown to
identify non-Arab Iran as its strongest `outer' enemy."

"Gingrich follows Israel's lead"

"The moving power behind the directive to the CIA is
Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia ... an ex officio
member of the House Intelligence Committee, which has to
authorize covert operations. He is a rabid supporter of
Israel, as is his wife Marianne, who is vice-president of
an Israeli company, the Israeli Export Development
Corporation of Jerusalem.  Gingrich himself has been a
consistent re cipient of contributions from pro-Israel
groups, totaling through the 1994 election around $70,000,
not including individual donations. In 1994 he led a group
of new Republican Congressmen on a visit to Israel to extol
its virtues, and in Congress he strongly supports massive
aid to Israel while crusading for budget cuts in almost
every other area involving needy Americans.

"Following Israel's lead, Gingrich has become one of the
most vocal and hysterical critics of Iran.  He has called
it `a permanent, long-term threat to civilized life on
this planet ... a terrorist s tate ... committed to
defeating the West in any way it can'... [H]e has warned
Americans that Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass
destruction could enable it `to annihilate Tel Aviv and in
 the long run to annihilate Chicago or Atlanta.'"

US POPULATION ISSUES

from The Balance Activist, March 1996, a publication of 
Population-Environment Balance, a membership organization.

U.S. is the third most populous country in the world:
March 96 population estimate: 263,457,000.

U.S. population increases by about 3 million every year.

Present U.S. growth rate = 1.1%.  At this rate our 
population will double in 64 years.

To accommodate growth, we pave over an area the size of 
Delaware every year.  Every person adds an extra acre of 
land for urbanization and road-building.

In 1993, more than 53 million U.S. residents drank 
contaminated water.

The U.S. fertility rate in 1995 was 2.08 which is
approximately replacement level, but up from 1.7 in 1976.
Also, the percentage of unintended pregnancies increased
from 29% in 1970 to 33% in 1990.

Immigration is the largest contributor to population
growth accounting for more than 50% when the higher
fertility rates of immigrants are taken into account. We
currently admit about 800,000 legal immigrants a year.

Dr. George Borjas of Harvard University estimates that
immigration costs U.S. workers $133 billion annually,
mainly in lost job opportunities and depressed wages.  Dr.
Donald Huddle of Rice Universit y calculates the cost of
immigration in 1994 at a net $52 billion to U.S.
taxpayers, after subtracting the taxes paid by immigrants,
with that amount slated to increase to an average of $81
billion a nnually by 2004 unless immigration is
substantially reduced.

California is considering reversing its 1972 ban on
hunting cougars.  California's population growth,
increasing from 10 million in 1950 to 32 million in 1996,
has resulted in development in prime co ugar habitat, which
has driven the cougars out of the mountains and into
backyards.

U.S. Nuclear Issues

"Nuclear Wastes in the Colorado River"  by Ken Sleight in 
American Rivers, Spring 1996
"The Colorado River and its tributaries are fast becoming
some of the most threatened waterways of America, as great
amounts of radioactive wastes escape regularly into the
Colorado River system.

"Uranium mill tailings make up the largest volume of
radioactive waste in the country. For decades, thousands
of these mill tailings have been abandoned in our canyons.
 Piles of waste lie along the Colorado River, beneath the
waters of Lake Powell, and on the upper reaches of their
tributary streams.

"Radiation from Uravan, an old tailings site in Colorado,
is still leaking, like a giant sieve, throughout the
subsoil into the San Miguel River. These nuclear wastes
then flow into the Dolores and then the Colorado River. 
The Atlas milling site downstream is also leaching its
destructive waste into the Colorado, directly affecting
both Arches and Canyonlands National Parks....The Colorado
Heal th Department issued a permit to Umetco Minerals for a
new tailings pile to be sited over the old dumping ground
at Uravan.

"Utah was not consulted, even though the wastes would flow
down the rivers into Utah, Arizona, and then into
California..."

ZAIRE:  Population and Health Report from The Washington 
Post National Weekly Edition Feb 5-11, 1996.
Population: 44 million  (mid 1993: 41.2 million)
Growth rate: 3%, at which population would double by 2020.

Fertility rate: 6.7 (children per woman)
Life expectancy at birth: 52
Medical staff: One doctor for 14,286 people; one nurse for 
1,351 people.
30 million have no access to health services, 24 million no 
access to safe water and 31 million no access to sanitation

Title: /DEVELOPMENT BULLETIN 02/ KENYA: Anti-Asian Sentiment Slammed

By Moyiga Nduru

NAIROBI, May 20 (IPS) - Efforts to whip up anti-Asian feeling by a
enyan opposition leader has been condemned from both within and
outside his party.

''As a national leader aspiring to be president, (Kenneth)
Matiba's recent remarks on Asians might scare away international
investors,'' notes Chris Weira Gibabir, a top official of Matiba's
Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD-ASILI).

Gibabir was distancing himself from Matiba's populist demagoguery
against Asians who he accused of elbowing Africans out of business
in a press conference here last week.

''You just drive round Nairobi, and what you see is that all the
shops are owned by Asians,'' Matiba said. ''You go to Mombasa, all
the shops are owned by Asians. This has created a very serious
situation where indigenous Kenyans think they have become second
class citizens in their own country.''

In a 16-page paper, 'The Asian Question,' made available to IPS,
Matiba accuses Asians of corruption ranging from graft, tax
evasion and unscrupulous acquisition of land and citizenship.

''The issue of citizenship should be addressed more fully <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> that
people do not acquire citizen status only to dominate the locals.
Standards should be set <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a> high <a name=L10003></a><a href=#L10004>so</a> that not just anybody becomes a
citizen,'' he said. ''This is because it is not unusual to find an
Asian who doesn't understand Kiswahili or even English claiming to
be a citizen. Those who have got the citizenship illegally should
have them revoked without reservation.''

Matiba, who heads one of the country's three main opposition
parties, also claimed that Asians distrust local banks and
deposited their funds in Asian-controlled finance houses.

''To make matters worse, most Asians are known to keep large sums
of money at home rather than banking it or banking it conveniently
in the UK or Canada where most hold citizenship <a name=L10004></a><a href=#L10005>so</a> that if the
worst comes to the worst they can emigrate there. This hence
denies other Kenyans capital when they seek loans from banks,''
said Matiba.

Immediately after Matiba's press conference, assistant minister
of information and broadcasting Sharrif Nassir slammed his speech
as ''racist and unjustified'' as well as a threat to national
security.

For many Asians here, Matiba's position has kindled fears of the
repetition of the expulsion of 60,000 Asians from neighbouring
Uganda in 1972, by strongman Idi Amin.

''The Asian community is badly shaken,'' said Asian businessman
Salim Talib. ''I have been receiving telephone calls from many
concerned Asians regarding this anti-Asian feeling.''

Talib, with others, have formed the Eastern Action Club (EACA), a
non-profit minority rights' group, to address the problems facing
the Asian community in Kenya.

Noting that Matiba's attack focused on Asian traders, Amin
Gwaderi, chair of the Nairobi-based EACA says: ''We assume that
the criticism is not against Asian lawyers, doctors, engineers,
secretaries, clerical workers, industrialists and <a name=L10005></a><a href=#L10006>so</a> on.''

''It can be aptly argued, further, that criticism of persons
engaged in certain economic activity cannot result in the
condemnation of an entire race and would be a step in the
direction of racial prejudice.''

Gwaderi notes that there are less than 70,000 Asians in Kenya --
descendants of those brought over as labourers by the British in
the last century -- yet this 0.27 percent of the country's 26
million population is said to be responsible for up to 80 percent
of economic activity.

''This 0.27 percent creates employment, pays the majority of the
taxes and anchors the foreign exchange earnings of Kenya. Why then
is it perceived as a threat to the economy by misguided
politicians?''

''They (Asians) have also invested, and continue to invest,
heavily in the future of this country,'' he pointed out. ''That is
why Asian businesses are sustainable and come to the notice of
politicians. They are not liquidated for personal financial gains
at a moment's notice.''

Matiba, in repeating the well-worn complaints against the Asian
community, has attempted to tap into the widespread anti-Asian
feeling that exists here.

That sentiment resulted in an orgy of looting in 1982 during an
attempted coup which brought the poor onto the streets who
deliberately targeted Asian shops and businesses.

Matiba denies that he has threatened to expel Asians should he
win next year's general elections, but stands by his allegations.

''I'm well aware that Europeans and Asians will criticise Matiba.
Let them say whatever they want to say. Facts are facts,'' he
said. (end/ips/mn/jm/oa/96)

Title: /DEVELOPMENT BULLETIN 08/ SUDAN: IMF Says Agreement Remains
Elusive

By Rose Umoren

WASHINGTON, May 23 (IPS) - The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
says an agreement with the Sudanese military government of Omar El
Bashir on either a monitored programme or terms for clearing the
country's 1.7-billion-dollar repayment arrears to the financial
institution is still elusive.

Sudan's finance minister Abdel Wahhab Osman was quoted last week
as saying the two sides had reached an agreement on terms for
paying the arrears. But an IMF official told IPS an agreement on
either issue was still a long way off.

''It is inconceivable that the rather very large arrears could be
regularised in such a fashion,'' said the official who preferred
not to be identified.

He said the earliest the IMF would make a new decision on Sudan
was Aug. 8 when its executive board deliberates on the report of a
mission that returned from Khartoum last weekend.

The board will review both the ''latest developments and overall
relationship with Sudan'' at the meeting, he said.

The official was, however, not optimistic that an agreement will
be reached even then. For one, he said it would be difficult to
convince the board that the El Bashir government would keep policy
promises or maintain any arrears- clearing schedule under the
agreement.

''Past experience has taught us that it cannot,'' he said.

Under an existing agreement on the arrears, Khartoum is supposed
to pay the IMF four million dollars monthly. ''It has not kept
this schedule for the past four months,'' said the official.

He acknowledged that, in any event, Sudan's recently heightened
international isolation could affect how the board views its case.

''Countries are better off when they have friends,'' he said.
''Political complications do have economic impact, including
direct impact.'' He would not elaborate.

Politics aside, ''relations with Sudan are very complicated, it
is not just the arrears,'' said the official. ''We know they do
not have this money. What we want is for them to come up with a
credible package of policies that can unleash the potential of the
economy.''

With that, he said, the IMF would put the country in what it
calls a rights accumulation programme. Under such an arrangement,
a country in arrears adopts policies the IMF deems necessary for
restoring its external viability. In return, the Fund encourages
bilateral creditors to provide loans for clearing the Fund
arrears.

According to the IMF, eight of the 11 countries for which the
programme was created have cleared their arrears. They include
Zambia, the most recent case, Sierra Leone, and Peru.

Sudan is among the countries that have yet to clear their
arrears.

''The executive board has been giving it extension after
extension over the last two years to improve its financial
situation to no avail,'' said the IMF source.

Describing Sudan as ''one unhappy story,'' the official said that
''various Sudanese officials had, in the past, come to th}
executive board, making pledge after pledge which they did not
live up to.''

Such pledges formed the basis of a staff-monitored programme
which usually precedes a full IMF-monitored plan. But because of
Khartoum's record on carrying out agreed policies, the staff
programme lapsed in 1995. (END/IPS/RU/YJC/96)

Title: /ENVIRONMENT BULLETIN 01/ AFRICA: EU Aims To Sweep Up Africa's
Fishing 'Gold Mines'

By Tjitske Lingsma

AMSTERDAM, May 20 (IPS) - Their own seas sucked clean of viable
stocks of fish, the European Union's industrial fishing fleets are
heading south to African waters -- with, say NGOs, EU diplomats
clearing the way with a series of inequitable fisheries pacts.

''The whole logic of these fisheries agreements is: how can we
find fish to catch for our redundant European fishing fleets,''
says Magda Aelvoet, a Belgian Green party member of the European
Parliament.

The EU is desperate to preserve the domestic fishing industries
of Spain, Portugal, Britain and others, to save jobs in European
regions dependent on employment in fishing and keep its
technological edge against commercial challenges form the East.

''The accords are purely commercial,'' says her Dutch colleague
Jan Willem Bertens. ''The only thing that counts in the accords is
safeguarding European fishing interests.''

Currently the EU has a dozen fishing agreements with African
countries and plans this year to start negotiations on renewing
accords with countries with Angola, Gambia and Senegal. Agreement
heralds arrival of massive European trawler fleets; sometimes
local aid, trade contracts, technology transfer or other
compensation.

Generally however the developing nations are ill-equipped -- both
diplomatically and industrially -- to effectively contest the EU's
claim to fish their waters. ''Developing countries are in a weak
position and are forced to yield,'' says Aelvoet.

''The EU takes the lead and does everything it wants. If I see
how the game is being played with developing countries, I can only
say that it is played very hard.

The fishing question is a 'hot issue' acknowledges Bertens. Spain
and Portugal, whose ships roam the globe in search of fish
international waters, have demanded the EU take a strong line on
the fishing rights talks <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> as to open up new areas for their
declining industries closer to home.

''For Spain and Portugal it is a vital question. It has become a
hard sector,'' says Bertens. Competition has become even more
acute as the problem of overfishing has worsened. The U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) says 70 percent of the world's
fish stocks are fully exploited, over exploited, depleted or
recovering.

The fisheries agreements became a necessity in the wake of the
1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). It
gave coastal states acquired the control over an Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) extending 200 miles form their coast,
including the zone's natural resources.

The convention put 35 percent of the world's oceans under the
jurisdiction of coastal states -- and 95 percent of identified
global fish stocks under the control of mainly underdeveloped
coastal countries, notes the Brussels-based Coalition for Fair
Fisheries Agreements.

The developed world's fishing fleets got the European Union,
Russia, Japan, China and South Korea, among others to start work
on pacts that would give them access to these waters and quotas
setting minimums and maximum catches.

The pacts cost the EU money -- 280 million ECU (342 million
dollars) in additional aid in 1995 alone -- but most of the extra
funds go to national budgets and very little to help developing
world fishing industries, unable to compete with the EU's monster
trawlers.

International environmental and development NGOs say the income
in aid hardly comes close to fairly compensating the developing
world fishing communities and holds European trawler fleets
largely responsible for overfishing in African waters.

''The problem is overfishing,'' says Harry de Vries of the Dutch
development organisation NOVIB, which this week began a campaign
highlighting the effect of the EU's fishing policy on Senegal as
an example of the wider problem. ''The accords form a sort of
legalisation for looting the oceans.''

The European Parliament backs Bertens and Aelvoet, and views the
fishery accords as counter-productive that not only fail to aid
the development of Third World countries but actually hinder the
growth of local fishing sectors. Millions in the South make a
living as traditional fishers, using small boats and homemade
nets.

Bertens and Aelvoet say the EU fishery pacts clash with the EU's
guiding Maastricht Treaty of political union, which is supposed to
ensure 'coherence' -- ensuring that EU initiatives do not
frustrate EU development goals in developing countries.

''In fishing activities it means that it should be impossible for
the EU signs agreements that undermine the interests of, for
example, the Senegalese fishing communities,'' said Aelvoet. ''But
in Senegal's waters over-fishing is looming.

''It is completely contrary to the coherence principle,'' she
said, noting that the same priorities are not allowed to undermine
the EU's own fishery or agricultural policies.

Bertens says some blame can be laid at the door of the developing
nations themselves, some of whom prefer to see short term gains
from pacts with the EU instead of looking to long-term sustainable
development of their own traditional fleets. ''They don't want to
be seen as a developing country, but want to be taken seriously
and prefer a commercial approach,'' he suggested.

Not all countries give in however. In 1991 Namibia refused to
come to an agreement with the Europeans and the Moroccans fought
long and hard for the best deal they could get out of the EU in
1995.

At the time the EU was furious, but MP Bertens was elated by the
'Namibian approach'. After the negotiations broke down, the
Namibians decided to invite the private sector to come up with
their own cooperative deals.

Foreign investors have since invested 45 million dollars in a new
Namibian fishing industry employing 1,500 people, considered quite
an achievement in Namibia, which has a population of 1.5 million.

Morocco's own decision to block renewal of an existing pact in
April 1995 left 700 EU fishing vessels tied up in ports in
southern Spain, the Canary Islands and Portugal. Up to 40,000 EU
fishing industry jobs were put in doubt and it took months of
negotiation before a new pact was agreed in November last year.

Rabat's firm stand during the negotiations saw EU fleet access to
its waters reduced, a 'rest period' banning fishing to allow stock
to replenish themselves and for more fish to be landed for
processing in Morocco, thereby boosting local employment.

EU fishing fleet owners will be ordered to land 30 percent of
their squid and octopus catches in Moroccan ports by the end of
the final year of the four year pact. The EU will also pay
compensation of 162 million dollars a year in return for fishing
rights, up from 135 million under the previous three-year
agreement.

Morocco, which says that overfishing by EU boats have forced it
to lay up a third of its fleet of 2,000 vessels, is also expected
to receive at least 420 million dollars in extra EU aid over the
next three years for other projects, and concessions on access to
EU markets for other agricultural products.

Fish accounts for 15 percent of all Moroccan exports and the
industry employs at least 150,000 people. Morocco is the largest
world exporter of sardines. In comparison income from fishing
makes up only one percent of Spain's gross domestic product but
indirectly employs three percent of its working population -- and
25 percent in the north western province of Galicia.

The two Euro-MPs think more African cooperation is necessary and
that countries should learn from each other's experiences. ''It is
important to strengthen links between countries with worse and
better agreements,'' said Aelvoet.

She hopes this will consolidate their position during
negotiations with the EU. ''At present they are being played off
against each other.'' (END/IPS/TL/RJ/96)

Liberia: Recent Documents, 1
Date Distributed (ymd): 960527

While attention to the Liberian crisis in the news media has
diminished, repeated outbreaks of violence continue and the
desperate humanitarian situation has not eased. While
discussion continues on the appropriate form of greater
international involvement, there is wide consensus among those
concerned that the response to date has been inadequate, and
that U.S. leadership will be essential if there is to be more
effective international involvement.  

This posting and the next include several recent statements
and background documents, from the Africa Faith and Justice
Network, InterAction, the U.S. Congress, and other sources.

Background

U.S. House of Representatives on Liberia 

The Subcommittee on Africa of the International Relations
Committee of the United States House of Representative held
hearings on Liberia on May 8, 1996. The hearings, which were
presided over by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R.Fl), heard testimony
from Hon. George Moose, Assistant Secretary for African
Affairs, Department of State, Hon. Vince Kern, Deputy
Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, International
Security Affairs, Department of Defense and Lady Johne Bush,
President, Liberia Community Association of Rhode Island. 

Testimony of Assistant Secretary of State In his testimony,
Mr. Moose stated that the United States Government "considers
the Abuja Accord -- an interim government, disarmament,
demobilization and the holding of free and fair elections ---
the best framework for a permanent solution", to the Liberian
crisis. According to him, "Despite its current difficulties,
we believe ECOMOG can again become an effective peacekeeping
force." Mr. Moose also reiterated the U.S. condemnation of the
current fighting and stated that the U.S. Administration "now
know faction leaders did not wholeheartedly commit themselves
to the peace process but apparently pursued multiple
strategies -- one for peace, the other for war."

The Assistant Secretary of State also stated that "Another
significant factor" which contributed to the renewal of
conflict "was that overall support for the peace process,
including support for ECOMOG, was slow in coming and has not
been at the level we had hoped would be committed." 

Mr. Moose noted current U.S. diplomatic activities in light of
the Easter outbreak of continued war in Liberia and explained
U.S. role in pressuring the various warring factions in
ensuring that "the situation in Monrovia ... be stabilized.
Fighters ... withdraw from the capital and Monrovia ...once
again become a safe haven. Faction leaders ... agree to
abandon violence in favor of a political process for settling
differences." 

Mr. Moose said that the United States "will continue ...
vigorous support for ECOWAS' efforts to achieve a negotiated
solution to the current crisis and to reaffirm a peace process
which encompasses disarmament, demobilization and the holding
of free, fair and democratic elections." According to him,
"ending arms flows into Liberia remains critical to halting
the current fighting" and the United States is "pressing for
tougher enforcement of the 1992 UN arms embargo and" is
"asking other countries to join ... in this effort."

According to Moose the U.S. is "looking at ways to increase
.... support for ECOMOG." He said that "If ECOMOG can
demonstrate a renewed capacity to play a neutral and effective
peacekeeping role," the U.S. "would be prepared to make
available approximately $30 million form existing resources in
equipment and other additional assistance." Moose said that
"although some ECOMOG troops failed to do their duty during
the recent fighting and may have participated in the looting,
others performed commendably." He noted that "more than 100
ECOMOG soldiers have died in the past three weeks in Liberia
defending the capital." Chairperson of Africa Subcommittee
Remarks

In opening remarks, Chairperson, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen pointed
out that "The people of Liberia desperately want peace; yet it
is the faction leaders who repeatedly choose to pursue their
political objectives through violent means with a total
disregard for the suffering inflicted on their fellow
Liberians." She further stated that "The people of Liberia
want a cease-fire and a return to normalcy." According to her
"The people of Liberia want to see their country flourish once
again." Ms. Ros-Lehtinen then said that "The U.S. and the
international community are ready and willing to help, but
only if there is a demonstrable commitment to the peace
process and to a cease-fire."

....And What About Nigeria and the U.S. Senate 

Meanwhile, several US Senators introduced Senate Resolution
248 towards the end of April. Senate Resolution 248
(April 22 Version) is a welcome starting point for the
Congress to complement the Administration efforts in assisting
the Liberian people achieve peace. However, the language of
the bill creates problems when it states as part of its
Resolve to "...support non-Nigerian West African
peacekeepers," or "...training for crowd control techniques
for non-Nigerian troops to participate effectively in a West
African Peacekeeping force." (Section 4 a, b of S. Res. 248)

Certainly, the concern of Senators Feingold, Kassebaum, Simon,
Leahy, Jeffords and Pell, co-sponsors of S. Res. 248, about
the Nigerian role in ECOMOG is well intentioned. However,
realistically speaking, there is no way ECOMOG can be
effective without Nigeria's involvement. About eight out of
every ten ECOMOG peacekeepers in Liberia are Nigerian. No
other African country has expressed willingness to supplant
ECOMOG if Nigeria decides to withdraw.

Additionally, Nigeria has been dominantly involved since
August 1990, when ECOMOG intervened following the refusal of
the United States to intervene militarily in Liberia to halt
the slaughter of 150,000 Liberians.

According to Nigerian sources about $4 billion has been spent
by the Nigerian government on its peacekeeping activities in
Liberia. To now think that Nigeria can be done away with and
still have an effective ECOMOG presence in Liberia in the
absence of any other country in the world to replace it, is
not only wishful thinking but a recipe which would condemn the
rest of Liberians in the country to certain death. That must
not be allowed to happen. 

The penchant to punish Nigeria for its gruesome violation of
human rights must not and should not be visited upon the
Liberian people who have already suffered enormously. No other
current war in the world has resulted in the level of
destruction Liberia has known in the last six years. Almost
every single Liberian no longer lives in the home s/he lived
in prior to the war in December 1989. More than 200,000
Liberians out of a population of 2.3 million have died. A
further 700,000 continue to live in wretched conditions as
refugees, notably in Guinea and other African countries.
Thousands upon thousands more are venturing out to sea to
escape the mayhem which has befallen their dear country. They
have been refused entry into such places as Cote d'Ivoire,
where only a few days ago a fishing vessel carrying Liberian
refugees was turned away. In the past the Ivorians welcomed
Liberians as refugees. More than 300,000 Liberians already
live in Cote d'Ivoire as refugees. 

Several reports suggest that Nigerian members of the
peacekeepers have been engaged in looting. However, none of
them said that the looting was initiated by the Nigerians. All
of the reports appear to suggest that the looting was started
by the Liberian armed militia. Can anyone confidently say that
no other peacekeepers in Liberia have looted except the
Nigerians? Peacekeepers around the world are known to engage
in rogue behavior. The setting up of brothels by U.N.
peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia or the brutality
committed by Canadian peacekeepers against Somalis in Somalia
are a few cases in point. 

ECOMOG weaknesses as were manifested in looting, the sale of
weapons to various warring factions should not be viewed as
obstacles. Instead attempts should be made to strengthen and
discipline ECOMOG forces. These could include but not be
limited to the following: 

 - morale boosting measures such as the updating of their
salaries arrears and perhaps even bonuses for good performance
and behavior; 
- the provision of logistics to enable them to carry out their
mission; 
- the provision of medical facilities <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> peacekeepers would
not helplessly watch as their comrades lives ebb away; 
- provision of adequate housing <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a> that they would not be
exposed to the elements. 

At the same time mechanisms should be established which would
ensure that provisions made available to ECOMOG are used
strictly for the purpose of peacekeeping activities. Such a
mechanism could include participation from ECOWAS, UNOMIL, the
transitional government and the United States Embassy in
Monrovia. This will ensure accountability, if the fear of not
involving Nigerians is centered around the issue of
accountability. 

Conclusion 
 
It would be wise that support for ECOMOG does not translate
into further stagnation of the Liberian peace process. Time
has already run out. To salvage whatever is left of the
current peace accord, all steps taken must be done <a name=L10003></a><a href=#L10004>so</a> with
urgency.

IN RESPONSE TO THE GROWING CRISIS IN LIBERIA, 14 US
HUMANITARIAN AGENCIES CALL FOR THE CREATION OF A UNITED
NATIONS PEACEKEEPING FORCE

The prolonged crisis in Liberia has forced nearly a third of
the country's population to flee their homes and seek refuge
abroad. An additional 40 percent of the population has become
internally displaced within Liberia, dependent on others for
their survival. The nation's infrastructure is in ruins.
Hundreds of thousands of children are unschooled and tens of
thousands have been transformed by the warlords into "boy
soldiers."

The most recent fighting has brought the conflict into
Monrovia, resulting in a total breakdown of law and order.
Relief agencies and international organizations, which have
been providing essential humanitarian services for the
majority of the capital's citizens, were forced to leave
Liberia. With their offices looted, their vehicles stolen and
the lives of their staff at risk in the continuing chaos, it
is not clear what assistance they will be able to provide.
Relief activities in the countryside also have been disrupted
by the spreading conflict.

Years of negotiations have failed to resolve the conflict
among Liberia's warlords. The pleas of the Liberian people for
peace continue to be ignored by those leading the various
armed factions.


In order to bring an end to suffering of the Liberian people,
the undersigned agencies urge:

o That the United States government recommend to other members
of the United Nations Security Council the formation of a
United Nations peacekeeping force which would be sent to
Liberia as soon as possible. The goal of this operation would
be to restore security <a name=L10004></a><a href=#L10005>so</a> that conditions can be created that
make possible (1) the resumption of humanitarian assistance,
(2) the demobilization of combatants, and (3) a political
process which will lead to free and fair election of a
government of national unity.

o That the U.S. government take the initiative to see that,
while units from other peacekeeping-force contributors are
being mobilized, the ECOMOG units on the ground in Liberia be
brought under the authority of the United Nations. After
consultation with ECOWAS, the high command of ECOMOG would be
replaced by personnel appointed by the United Nations Security
Council. Once under United Nations command, ECOMOG would
receive equipment, training and other services provided by
donor countries through a fund designated by the United
Nations solely for supporting U.N. security operations in
Liberia.

o That those West African governments which have provided
refuge to almost a million Liberians be commended and
encouraged by the U.S. government to maintain open borders for
Liberians fleeing their country by whatever means. Particular
attention should be paid at this time to the urgent
humanitarian needs of persons fleeing violence by sea.

o That the international community be encouraged by the U.S.
government to provide more generous support to those West
African governments assisting Liberian refugees. The U.S.
government should increase its own level of support to those
governments.

o That political aspects of the peace process be addressed at
a senior level by the U.S. government as acceptable levels of
security are achieved by the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in
Liberia. It is clear that Liberians and the international
community have grave doubts about the viability of the
transitional power-sharing arrangement that was created by the
Abuja Accords. Nevertheless, it is recognized that the
cooperation of the warring factions would be a component of a
successful peace process. With this consideration in mind, the
U.S. government is urged to ensure that the United Nations
permits a role for the Transitional Government created by the
Abuja Accords, only if the warring factions participate in a
comprehensive demobilization program.

o That the U.S. government take the lead in seeing that the
donor community provides sufficient funds for a serious
disarmament and demobilization program which will offer
combatants the prospect of successful reintegration into
civilian life.

o That the U.S. government, in conjunction with the United
Nations Security Council, take vigorous steps to see that
nations in the West African region and elsewhere comply with
the existing United Nations arms embargo on Liberia.

o That the United States naval vessels currently off Monrovia,
or replacements with similar capabilities, remain on station
off Liberia.

Liberia: Recent Documents, 2
Date Distributed (ymd): 960527

While attention to the Liberian crisis in the news media has
diminished, repeated outbreaks of violence continue and the
desperate humanitarian situation has not eased. While
discussion continues on the appropriate form of greater
international involvement, there is wide consensus among those
concerned that the response to date has been inadequate, and
that U.S. leadership will be essential if there is to be more
effective international involvement.  

This posting and the preceding one include several recent
statements and background documents, from the Africa Faith and
Justice Network, InterAction, the U.S. Congress, and other

Letter to President Clinton

From Senators Russell D. Feingold, Carol Moseley-Braun,
Patrick J. Leahy, Paul Simon, Diane Feinstein and
Representative Donald Payne

May 23, 1996

President William J. Clinton
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20500

Dear Mr. President:

      We wish to express our deep concern about the recent
tragic developments in Liberia and our belief that a new,
bolder approach is needed from the United States and the
international community.

      We have strongly supported the role of the ECOMOG forces
since their initial deployment. Given the most recent
fighting, however, it appears that the West African
peacekeeping operation does not have the adequate resources or
capabilities to restore security to this war-torn country.  In
the absence of a strong peacekeeping force, the major factions
have engaged in actions that seriously violate the terms of
the Abuja Accord, signed on Aug. 19, 1995. Demobilization
efforts have been unable to proceed as scheduled, and major
armed conflict has returned to Monrovia.

      We believe that a long-term resolution of conflict in
Liberia cannot be effectively realized with the strong
involvement of the international community and the United
Nations.  We, therefore, urge you to propose and advocate
among the other members of the U.N. Security Council the
augmentation of the existing U.N. mission into a peacekeeping
force to be sent to Liberia as soon as possible.  The force,
which should be drawn from interested African states,
including troops from existing ECOMOG forces, should be placed
under the authority of the United Nations.  The United States
can play a role in providing appropriate transportation and
logistical assistance.

      In our view, the presence of a more robust U.N. force
could bring about a cessation of the current round of fighting
and could help create an environment in which humanitarian
assistance, demobilization and implementation of the political
transition process outlined in the Abuja agreement can resume.

      The United States has a long an unique relationship with
Liberia and her people.  For this reason, we have a
responsibility to take the lead in helping formulate ways to
address this tragic situation.  Continued hostilities in the
country will only add to the humanitarian disaster and lead to
increased regional instability.  Accordingly, we have a
compelling national interest to take a more active role in
securing peace.

Sincerely,

Russell D. Feingold
Carol Moseley-Braun
Patrick J. Leahy
Paul Simon
Diane Feinstein
Donald Payne

OFDA Fact Sheet # 22  Liberia

U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
BUREAU FOR HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE (BHR)
OFFICE OF U.S. FOREIGN DISASTER ASSISTANCE (OFDA)            

LIBERIA - Complex Emergency

Fact Sheet # 22                     May 23, 1996 1700 EDT

Background:  On April 6, 1996, fighting in Monrovia erupted
between two armed factions, Charles Taylor's National
Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and Roosevelt Johnson's wing
of the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia
(ULIMO-Krahn).  Other Krahn factions subsequently joined
Johnson. The fighting came in the wake of skirmishes that
followed the signing of the Abuja Accord, a comprehensive
peace agreement among leaders of the main warring factions, on
August 19, 1995.  The accord came after nearly six years of
civil war, in which more than 150,000 Liberians died, about
740,000 fled the country as refugees, and 800,000 became
internally displaced.

USAID/BHR/OFDA's Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART)
reports that fighting took place outside the U.S. Embassy on
May 18, 20, and 21.  USAID/DART visited the port on May 23 and
discovered that twenty-six rolls of plastic shelter material
procured by BHR/OFDA were missing.  In general, fighting and
a lack of unimpeded access, including travel restrictions at
bridges and other checkpoints, have isolated areas of Monrovia
from humanitarian relief personnel, supplies, and food.  The
World Food Program (WFP) reports that approximately 570,000
displaced have congregated on Bushrod Island attempting to
find a safe haven in warehouses, schools, and near Economic
Community of West African States Military Observer Group
(ECOMOG) installations.

Current Humanitarian Situation:  The fighting has displaced at
least 80,000 people in the Monrovia area, with 18,000 - 20,000
now seeking shelter in the Greystone compound of the U.S.
Embassy since fighting began again on April 29.  Intermittent
fighting in the Mamba Point area disrupts the daily delivery
of chlorinated drinking water to Greystone.  On May 20,
USAID/DART, U.N. agencies, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), and Liberian officials attended a water and sanitation
coordination meeting at the U.N. Riverview compound.  Water
supply to Bushrod Island is insufficient due to a mechanical
breakdown at the White Plains water facility.  The facility
only has the capacity to pump water every other day because
one of the two diesel engines in the plant is not functioning. 
The European Union has ordered another engine, but expects
delivery to take six weeks.  On May 23, USAID/DART assessed
conditions at the Greystone compound.  Approximately 25
patients are currently being treated in the suspected cholera
unit established by Medecins Sans Frontieres International
(MSF/I) and Action Contre la Faim (ACF).   The number of
severe diarrheal disease cases admitted to the unit continues
to decrease.  Security problems in the past few days have
halted an ACF measles vaccination campaign.  From May 17 - 23,
USAID/Liberia, the Liberian Red Cross, and Liberian WFP staff
distributed nearly 65 metric tons (MT) of food, a two-week
supply, to vulnerable populations in Greystone.  WFP and the
U.S. Embassy have delivered approximately 2,950 MT of food in
Monrovia and surrounding areas since April 10.

On May 13, a medical team consisting of MSF/I and MERCI, a
Liberian NGO, entered the Barclay Training Center (BTC) where
approximately 15,000 - 20,000 people took refuge when fighting
began on April 6, including armed members of ULIMO-Krahn, and
the Armed Forces of Liberia, a contending faction.  Due to
security conditions, this was the first time humanitarian
organizations had been able to assess the situation at BTC
since April 22.  Sanitary conditions are deplorable, with
septic tanks broken and sewage flowing between buildings.  A
total of 18 patients were in need of immediate surgery with
three reported to be in very critical condition.  There is
also a measles outbreak.  MSF/I staff members had hoped to
begin a measles vaccination campaign but thus far have not
been able to return to the BTC due to security problems.

Over 1,550 refugees who fled Liberia on May 5 in a Nigerian
vessel, the Bulk Challenger, disembarked at Takoradi, Ghana,
on May 13.  The U.S. Embassy in Ghana is working with the
Ghanaian government, the U. N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), and a consortium of NGOs to coordinate assistance. 
USAID/OFDA released $25,000 in emergency funds to the U.S.
Embassy to provide food, water, fuel, and shelter for the
refugees.  The State Department's Bureau of Population,
Refugees, and Migration also pledged an additional one million
dollars to UNHCR for Liberian refugees.

BOUTROS-GHALI WORRIED THAT ECOWAS WILL WITHDRAW FROM LIBERIA

By Judy Aita

USIA United Nations Correspondent

UNITED NATIONS -- Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is
concerned that continued fighting among the Liberian factions
will lead the West African countries (ECOWAS) to withdraw
their peacekeeping forces and ultimately force the U.N.
military observers and international humanitarian aid workers
also to leave the country.

In a report to the Security Council May 23, the secretary
general pointed out that the ECOWAS foreign ministers have
warned the faction leaders that if they did not return to the
Abuja peace process -- especially taking the steps necessary
to restoring basic law and order in Monrovia and engaging in
genuine negotiations -- the ministers would reconsider their
six-year involvement in the country at their August summit.

"Should ECOWAS be compelled to take the decision to disengage
from Liberia and withdraw ECOMOG (Economic Community of West
African States Monitoring Group), the U.N. Observer Mission in
Liberia would have no choice but to do the same,"
Boutros-Ghali said.

The unarmed U.N. observers are dependent on the security
provided by the ECOMOG forces to do their jobs.

The secretary general "is very, very worried that ECOWAS will
decide that it can't do anything further and will wash its
hands of the situation," said U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana Foa.

"If ECOWAS does decide it is fed up and they decide to
withdraw the ECOMOG forces from Liberia, we would consider
this to be catastrophic not only for the country, but for the
whole sub-region," Foa said.

Of UNOMIL's 93 military observers, only 10 remain on stand-by
in Freetown ready to return to Monrovia as soon as conditions
permit. Another five observers, including the chief military
observer, are in Monrovia to support political efforts to get
a cease-fire.

The secretary general said the situation is still "dangerous
and unpredictable" and he "strongly urged" the Liberian
factions "to consider carefully the wide-ranging consequences
that their actions during the next two months will have."

"Over the past six weeks, the faction leaders have clearly
demonstrated their disregard for the aspirations of the
Liberian people for peace. They have shown wanton disrespect
for the United Nations, ECOWAS, and the international
community," Boutros-Ghali said.

During the intense fighting in April, U.N. staff members were
forced from their homes and offices and robbed and harassed
while seeking safety. Vehicles were hijacked. UNOMIL and all
U.N. agencies have been "systematically looted by fighters
from all factions since April 6," he reported.

"The fighters cleaned out all United Nations offices, damaged
buildings and looted United Nations warehouses. Some 80
percent of UNOMIL vehicles were taken and many were
destroyed....UNOMIL telephones, computers, photocopiers,
communications equipment and general consumable items
including goods related to demobilization, were all looted,"
he said.

The U.N. is currently estimating the value of the loss, but it
has estimated that at least three months will be needed to
rebuild UNOMIL's logistic base.

The Security Council has to decide by the end of May whether

to extend UNOMIL's mandate. Boutros-Ghali recommended that
UNOMIL be continued for three months. His further
recommendations on the future of the mission will depend on
the outcome of the ECOWAS meeting in August. NNNN

Title: AFRICA-DISARMAMENT: Big Armies, Small Economies

by Lewis Machipisa and Gumisai Mutume

HARARE, May 23 (IPS) - First civil servants and public sector
workers felt the sting, now down-sizing under economic reforms is
beginning to affect Africa's holy of holies -- the military.

In Tanzania, the army eats up about 35 percent of the annual
recurrent budget of 1.2 billion dollars. Mounting donor pressure
for the relocation of funds from military spending to the more
productive social sector has led the government to signal that it
plans to trim its 40,000-strong defence force.

In neighbouring Uganda, responding to donor conditionalities
and the strain of maintaining a bloated former rebel army, the
government has already introduced retrenchment and sent its boy
soldiers off to school.

Congo has launched a scheme, the initiative of a former Belgian
mercenary officer, to turn its soldiers into farmers and
development workers, while the end of Mozambique's civil war has
seen the new unified national army drastically reduced.

But there is a catch. ''Yes African governments are cutting
down on manpower in their armies,'' notes Digby Waller, Defence
Economist of the UK-based International Institute of Strategic
Studies (IISS). ''But what is happening is that they are now
spending more on equipment.''

Sub-Saharan imports of major conventional weapons, on the
increase from 1983 to 1987, declined through to 1992. It is now
inching up again. ''The trend these days is to have smaller armies
but well equipped ones and this means money,'' says Waller.

In Uganda for example, plagued by rebel activity in the north,
the government is cutting to produce a leaner, better trained
force, and has embarked on a spending spree to ensure it is better
armed.

Post-apartheid South Africa is currently dismantling a huge
military industry that at its height built six nuclear weapons.
But its army has to undergo an expansion first before it
contracts.

The size of the army is being increased with the integration of
30,000 members of the liberation movements and the former homeland
armies. The plan involves a rise in the defence budget from 2.3
billion dollars to 2.5 billion dollars for the next three-years
before it falls.

Africa has witnessed some of the modern world's worst
conflicts. But its wars have been mostly intra-state, with its
arsenals of military hardware turned on its own people.

''Why do we import guns and other military hardware when
hospitals have no drugs?,'' asked former Costa Rican leader Oscar
Arias, in Tanzania this month to spearhead his campaign for the
demilitarisation of sub-Saharan Africa.

Defence spending for the tiny mountain kingdom of Lesotho
accounted for 5.1 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (742.5
million U.S. dollars) in 1992. In equally impoverished Burkina
Faso, it was 4.3 percent of its 3.3 billion U.S. dollar GDP.

Big arms buyers include strife-torn Angola, Sudan, Sierra
Leone, Uganda and a reconstructing Eritrea. Botswana in Southern
Africa, facing little external menace, is currently however sub-
Saharan Africa's largest weapons importer, according to Waller.

''Nigeria used to be the biggest but because of the (trade)
embargo it is no longer. Botswana has bought surplus equipment
from Canada and the Netherlands. A lot of that is second hand but
still modern equipment,'' he notes.

Similarly, with peace in Mozambique and the end of apartheid,
Zimbabwe faces little threat but retains one of sub-Saharan
Africa's largest armed forces. A five-year contract to supply
French-made armoured personnel carriers, helicopters and light
weapons was confirmed by the defence ministry in early 1995.

Defence expenditure accounted for 3.5 percent of Zimbabwe's GDP
and over eight percent of state expenditure in 1994. Almost 80
percent of Zimbabwe's defence budget pays for recurrent spending.

Defence was allocated 212.30 million U.S. dollars out of the
1994/1995 budget of 2.59 billion U.S. dollars. Only education
received a larger vote. The year before, military spending was 204
million U.S. dollars -- a 14-percent increase on the 1992 figure.

The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) has however not escaped down-
sizing, or at least the threat of it. In 1993 it began shedding
some of its soldiers. Reports say more than 4,000 have been
retired in the past two-years.

Colonel Trust Mugoba of the ZNA's Public Relations Department
defends the snail's pace, and explains why defence spending is
unlikely to fall in the near-future.

''The guys we retire should not become a problem to society.
That's why we now look at things like retirement packages and
skills training before the soldiers leave the army. All this has
to come from the defence expenditure,'' he says.

''We do not want situation where skilled soldiers are dumped
onto the streets without any qualification other than using a gun.
It would be very dangerous if we did something like that. There
are guns everywhere and just imagine what these guys can do.''

''They need education which takes time,'' he points out. ''This
is one of the reasons why down-sizing has been slow in our case.''

Mugoba is however hopeful that after 1997, defence spending
will fall and a more cost-effective army created.

For Susan Willet of the Centre for Defence Studies at Kings
College in London, the Southern African region is still a
potentially dangerous place.

''Southern Africa stability depends on the outcome of democracy
in South Africa. If democracy in South Africa does not hold then
(insecurity) will spill into other countries in the region and

these countries know it,'' she says. ''So by making sure that they
build up efficient armies, they are just being prudent.''

Title: ZAMBIA-POLITICS: Bomb Scares Rock Capital

by Joe Chilaizya

LUSAKA, May 24 (IPS) - Three bomb scares issued by a shadowy
opposition group brought the business centre of the Zambian
capital to a virtual standstill Friday, two days after parliament
passed a controversial constitutional amendment bill.

Shoprite Checkers, a busy South African-owned supermarket
chain, closed its doors Friday afternoon when it received a phone
call from a man claiming to represent the dissident 'Black Mambas'
warning that a bomb had been planted in its premises.

Police bomb disposal experts rushed to the scene and sealed off
the area, and another supermarket also allegedly threatened, only
to receive warning of a devise at the offices of the state-owned
newspaper the 'Times of Zambia'.

It was the second time in 24-hours that the paper had been
targeted in the new terror campaign. On Thursday night a death
threat was posted on the outside wall of the printing plant in
Ndola on the Copperbelt, listing the names of reporters to be
eliminated by <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a>-called Black Mamba hit squads.

Top of the hit list is the paper's managing director and editor-
in-chief, Emmanuel Nyirenda, features editor Samuel Ngoma and
political correspondent Kondwani Chirambo who were labeled as
'propagandists'.

Samuel Ngoma, who has taken an openly pro-government stand on
the constitutional crisis, says he is unmoved by the threats.

''I will not allow them to scare me. I have nothing to be
scared about dying,'' says the born again Christian. ''I have my
accommodation in heaven.''

But Chirambo appeared shaken. ''I really don't know how to take
this. You never know... it could be nothing, but it could be
something too. We can rule out nothing and have to be ready for
any eventuality,'' he told IPS.

The Black Mambas began issuing death threats immediately it
became apparent that the government of President Frederick Chiluba
would not bow to local and international pressure to have the
controversial constitution adopted by a constituent assembly
instead of the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD)-
dominated parliament.

The police have issued a 3,000 dollar reward leading to the
capture of any member of the Black Mambas.

Speculation is intense over who is behind the group with the
finger most often pointed at former President Kenneth Kaunda's
party, the United National Independence Party (UNIP).

During the Zambian independence struggle, Kaunda was nicknamed
the 'Black Mamba' by the colonial administration. UNIP had also
threatened unrest with the passing of the constitutional
ammendment bill which rules Kaunda out from standing in the
October presidential elections because, according to the
contentious clause, his parents were not Zambian.

UNIP on the other hand claims that the Black Mambas are a
creation of the MMD, looking to give itself a scapegoat for any
acts of violence which may erupt in the country as a result of
their uncompromising stand on the constitution.

In a new twist, the independent 'Chronicle' newspaper alleges
it has unimpeachable evidence that the Black Mambas are a group of
Islamic fundamentalists angry at the government's decision to
enshrine the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation in the
constitution.

Many here had dismissed the group as a hoax until last week's
botched bombing attempt at Chiluba's state house residence which
blew a small hole in the perimeter wall.

Now bomb scares are suddenly a regular occurrence. There was
one at the five-star Hotel Intercontinental in Lusaka on Thursday
night followed by the three Friday.

Not all Zambians are however taking them seriously. ''Aaah,
this is just politics. These guys (the Black Mambas) are practical
jokers and besides, it would be most un-Zambian,'' said a street
vendor.

''Zambians are not violent. These are just scare tactics by
some political players,'' he added.

Police say they are not leaving anything to chance. Security
has been reinforced around the president and his cabinet ministers
and other prominent government figures.

''We shall take everything very seriously until we are
convinced that there is nothing to the threats. Meanwhile,
investigations are still going on,'' Police spokesman Francis
Musonda told IPS.

Underlining the crackdown, a former Zambia air force officer,
Capt. Patrick Mphangula, was picked up for questioning Thursday
night, apparently over the Black Mamba campaign.

Mphangula is a member of Kaunda's UNIP who was fired two-years
ago from the air force for unknown reasons. He was previously an
MMD member who had expressed a desire to challenge Chiluba for
party leadership. (END/IPS/JC/oa/96)

Title: POPULATION-AFRICA: More People, Fewer Homes //Embargo//

//Att. Editors, the following story is under embargo and should
not be printed or otherwise reproduced before 1200 GMT on May 29//

By Joe Chilaizya

LUSAKA, May 29 (IPS) - Mailesi Ngoma presides over three
generations of her family in her small council house whose main
distinguishing feature is a lightning-shaped crack running from
the roof to the floor on one of the living room walls.

When she first moved in nearly 40 years ago, the five-roomed
house was big enough for her nuclear family. Now it has 15
occupants, but hardly anyone in her Lusaka township would find
that strange. Affordable housing is hard to find, <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> many
households live in homes built for at most half their number.

Nor is that situation exceptional in sub-Saharan Africa, whose
urban population has been growing at a much faster pace than
housing and other basic services, according to the U.N. Population
Fund (UNFPA).

In its 1996 'State of the World Population' report, released on
May 29, UNFPA notes that ''a vast number of people in urban areas
cannot adequately provide for their basic needs in shelter ...''
as well as other areas such as water and sanitation.

A look at the situation in various African nations shows that
this is hardly an exaggeration.

About 55 percent of the some 1.5 million residents of Nairobi
live in slums areas like Kibera shanty town, a jumbled collection
of mud-and-wattle huts bordering garbage-littered streets and open
sewers.

Roughly 1.2 million of the 10.5 million Zimbabweans needed
houses in 1995, while the housing deficit in South Africa, 17
percent of whose 41 million people live in squatter settlements,
is 1.5 million units, according to conservative estimates.

In Lagos, Africa's second largest city with a population of
about six million, sharing houses is common and thousands of
people have been forced to live under bridges and flyovers.

In Zambia, Minister of Local Government, Bennie Mwiinga,
estimates that more than 110,000 housing units need to be built
each year to meet the government's stated objective of ''shelter
for all by the year 2015''.

''Of the 1.3 million houses in the country, only 31 percent are
safe and adequate while the rest, 897,000, are shanty structures,
unapproved and unsafe for human habitation,'' he explained
recently.

''Only 36 percent of these houses are supplied with water by
the (municipal) councils,'' he added. ''Thirty-eight percent use
wells, 26 percent use streams and rivers. Only 17 percent have
flush toilets while 54 percent use pit latrines and 29 percent do
not have any toilet facilities at all.''

According to the U.N. Development Programme's 1996 Human
Development report, only 59 percent of urban residents in sub-
Saharan Africa had access to sanitation services in 1988-1993. In
the countryside, the percentage dropped to 29, the report showed.

And the 'State of the World Population' report shows that
Zambia is no isolated case where access to safe water is
concerned.

Fewer than 50 out of every 100 persons have access to safe
water in 18 of the 39 sub-Saharan African nations for which the
report gives such statistics. At the bottom of the list are
Central African Republic (12 percent) and Ethiopia (18). At the
other end of the scale, practically all Mauritians and 83 percent
of Ivoirians are assured of pure drinking water.

Remedying this situation, especially in towns, is likely to be
difficult. ''Providing adequate water supplies for burgeoning
urban populations is both costly and expensive,'' the report
points out.

''Private vendors fill the gaps, supplying an estimated 20
percent or more of the urban population of developing regions,''
it adds. ''But this service provides water of uncertain quality at
a premium price.''

Brazzaville is a case in point. The National Water Utility,
has been unable to supply the city with enough water, partly
because its equipment is defective and partly because it depends
on an erratic supply of electricity from by another public
utility, the National Electricity Corporation.

As a result, most Brazzaville residents, especially women, have
to choose between queuing up at standpipes that are often far from
their homes, buying water from vendors or drawing it from wells or
from the rivers that run through the Congolese capital.

Buying water from the vendors is often risky since few
households have the means to test its quality. The water from the
wells is not always clean and some rivers are infested by snails
which spread bilharzia.

Congo's water utility reflects the inability of services to
keep up with the rapid increase in the population of Africa's
cities.

In 1970, only about 84 million people lived in towns in sub-
Saharan Africa. By 1995, that figure had increased to more than
190,000, according to the UNFPA report, which puts the percentage
of urban dwellers in the various sub-Saharan regions from a high
of 48 in Southern Africa to a low of 22 in East Africa.

''Cities in Africa are growing faster than in any other
region,'' says the report, which attributes this mainly to
migration by villagers hoping to escape privation in the
countryside. It forecasts that Africa's urban population will grow
by another 4.3 percent between 1995 and 2000.

Many of the newcomers are likely to join the long list of
people longing for proper water, hoping for adequate sanitation
and dreaming of a home of their own.

For Zambian matriarch Mailesi Ngoma, that dream has come true
even if her children and grandchildren may have to wait a while
before they can eventually move into homes of their own.

She was one of more than 300 people who last month acquired the
council houses they occupied after paying about nine U.S. dollars
for their title deeds.

They received their houses free because of the poor state they
were in. Others will have to buy theirs: the Zambian government
has promised to sell its some 15,000 houses under a special
concessionary mortgage scheme in which it will supply 80 percent
of the funding towards their purchase by their tenants.

''It is the best thing that has happened to my family in many,
many years,'' said Ngoma, who had paid a total of about 2.4
million kwacha (now worth about 1905 U.S. dollars) in rent to the
municipality since she first moved into her house.

Her next words reflected the aspirations of millions of people
living in and around Africa's towns:

''Owning the roof over your head does a lot of wonders to one's
dignity. One can proudly say 'this is my house'. That, my young
friend, is an immeasurable thing for me.'' (END/IPS/JC/KB/96)

Title: ANGOLA-POLITICS: Child Soldiers Die in a War no One Talks About

By Louis Okamba

CUTO, Angola, May 23 (IPS) - It's a war whose echoes rarely reach
the outside world but for the Front for the Liberation of the
Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC-FAC), theirs is a do-or-die struggle to
free their territory from the rest of Angola.

Die they do, although there are few reliable body counts. And
some of the victims are child soldiers like 16-year-old Cristiano
Massanga, whom IPS met in this small village of about 500 people
located in the Cabindese forest.

That was on Sunday May 19. Cristiano and a few of his comrades
were keeping watch as the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA), posted just
about 800 metres away, fired at Cuto with 82-mm cannons.

''They are poor shots,'' the youth told a group of foreign
journalists, including this correspondent. ''They can't even hit
the chicken coops. They shoot at us every day but people here are
not afraid. Only the chickens -- they hide every time those
playthings (the cannon) make a noise.

''But the day we get some, things will be different because we
know the bush. It's is our territory. And we know exactly where
the enemy is.''

Cristiano Massanga will never see that day. According to FLEC-
FAC military operations chief Boniface Tchicaya, he and another
young combattant were cut down by Kalachnikov bullets on the
morning of May 20 during a firefight with an FAA unit just about
100 metres from Cuto.

''The fighting was really tough,'' said Tchikaya. ''Our forces
defended themselves well and were able to contain the 'invader'.''

Cabinda, a 7,200-sq. km enclave just south of Congo, is
separated from the rest of Angola by a narrow band of Zairean
territory. The some 300,000 Cabindans, who make up less than three
percent of Angola's population of 10.5 million, have more in
common, culturally and by way of language, with their neighbours
to the north than with other Angolans, a fact the rebels like to
point out.

During Angola's war of liberation from Portuguese rule, which
ended in 1975, the FLEC sought independence for Cabinda whereas
the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which
now governs Angola, has always opposed the separation of the oil-
rich enclave.

While the 19-year war between the FAA and the main Angolan
rebel force, the Union for the Total Liberation of Angola (UNITA)
ended in 1994 following protracted negotiations brokered by
international mediators, the conflict in Cabinda has dragged on,
attracting little attention outside of the enclave.

FLEC, which later became FLEC-FAC, has stuck to its original
demand. Unlike other groups that have accepted the autonomy
offered to the territory by the MPLA government, it wants nothing
short of independence for Cabinda and claims to have freed 340 sq.
kms of the enclave, mainly forested areas such as Cujo.

But its leaders have tended to play down the fact that many of
the combattants they depend on to carry on a struggle that has
lasted more than two decades are children. During visits to the
insurgents' camps, IPS saw quite a few teenagers bearing arms.

''From the time they go to primary school they are educated on
the need to sacrifice themselves for the 'nation','' explained one
man who gave his name as Clement B. ''As a result, they don't
baulk at anything and disregard any physical danger. Dying for
Cabinda is their contribution. Moreover, their parents encourage
them to make that supreme sacrifice and they're proud of it.''

Some start at a tender age. Twenty-one year old Antoine Sita
said he had been carrying out ''suicide'' missions since he was
eleven and bagged his first FAA soldier two months after he joined
up.

''I had to make up my mind to kill <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> as to live because the
enemy was aiming at me,'' he said. ''Now I don't hesitate when I
put my finger on the trigger. It doesn't make me happy, but I kill
to survive and to free my country from occupation.''

Sylvestre Tongo (15) also chose to risk his life in a war
decided by adults and almost lost it. He was wounded in the leg by
shrapnel on the night of May 19 in Katabuanga, 150 km from Cuto.

According to Dr. Alexandre Batchi, head of FLEC-FAC's health
wing, Sylvestre needed to be evacuated to a border hospital in
Zaire.

''Our health centre lacks everything and we have to evacuate
the wounded boy quickly to save his leg from amputation,'' Batchi
said. ''Naturally, since there is no road, he will be carried by
his colleagues. We lost a lot of people because of the lack of
health facilities and drugs.''

Many of the young people fighting in FLEC-FAC are school
dropouts who felt they had little option but to join up. Raoul do
Carmo Buity (18) did <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a> five years ago. ''I quit school for social
reasons,'' he said. ''My parents are poor. I had no choice but to
take up arms for my country. In the army I am looked after and I
am useful to the community.''

Others continue their studies in the bush, dividing their time
between the front and the schools run by the rebel group. Said 17-
year-old Alphonse Poaty, ''When things get rough I take up my gun
to defend my country. But I have to say it's never quiet for long
here in the bush. We spend more time fighting than in school.''

While the youths spoke freely about their exploits, they
clammed up when asked about living conditions in the rebel camps,
most of which are villages of about 100 persons in which any male
able to carry a gun is a combattant. One source did, however, tell
IPS that the children usually kept watch at night, while their
older companions, who did most of the fighting during the day,
slept.

But one child soldier, who asked not to be named, insisted that
they also took part in attacks, especially when the force needed
to get more Kalachnikovs and pistols from the FAA.

''We don't get any foreign assistance,'' he said. ''To get
weapons we are forced to ambush the enemy. When we do that, those
of us who are unlucky lose our lives and, when we can, we pick up
our comrades' bodies and bring them back to camp.''

''We children are good at ambushes,'' he added.

For all their bravado, Cabinda's child soldiers want the war to
end. Each of those IPS spoke with said he wanted to live freely in
an independent Cabinda and do the things young people of their age
do.

They also felt anger at the international community which, they
charged, had abandoned them to their fate. (END/IPS/LO/KB/96)

Title: LIBERIA: Pressure Grows for More U.S. Action

by Rose Umoren

WASHINGTON, May 24 (IPS) - As death and destruction mount in
Liberia, pressure is growing for U.S. President Bill CLinton to do
more to help bring peace to the country the United States founded
for its freed slaves 150 years ago.

Five senators from Clinton's democratic party wrote this week to
the president, asking him to take the lead in getting the United
Nations to upgrade its presence in the war-torn country.

A peacekeeping force, says the letter, ''should be drawn from
interested African states, including troops from the existing
(West African) ECOMOG force,'' and it should be ''placed under the
authority of the United Nations.''

The U.N. Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), which numbered
93 before the renewed factional warfare, has been reduced to only
five military observers in recent days. The mission was supposed
to arrange elections and disarm more than 60,000 fighters.

The United States ''can play a role in providing appropriate
transportation and logistical assistance'' in a U.N. peacekeeping
force, says the letter, written by Senators Russel Feingold,
Patrick Leahy, Dianne Feinstein, Carol Mosley-Braun, and Paul
Simon.

Re-stating their longstanding support for ECOMOG, the senators
note that ''given the most recent fighting, however, it appears
that the West African peacekeeping operation does not have the
adequate resources or capabilities to restore security.''

They remind Clinton that ''the U.S. has a long and unique
relationship with Liberia and her people.'' For this reason, they
argue, ''we have a responsibility to take the lead in helping
formulate ways to address this tragic situation.''

They also point out that continued hostilities in Liberia ''will
only add to the humanitarian disaster and lead to increased
regional instability.''

Accordingly, they say, ''we have a compelling national interest
to take a more active role in securing peace.''

As television and newspapers parade pictures of child soldiers,
corpses, and destroyed property, U.S. citizens have increasingly
taken up Liberians' call for more U.S. action.

''The cars (in Liberia) are American, the Liberian flag is
patterned after the U.S. flag and <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> are the aspirations of the
people,'' wrote columnist William Raspberry recently in the
Washington Post. ''This gives us a special interest in helping.''

Instead, he wrote, the United States has stood by while
''Liberia's neighbours are involved in a way that is quite
extraordinary for that part of the world.'' Naming Nigeria, Ghana,
Sierra Leone, and Guinea, Raspberry points out that ''all this
(effort has been) from countries with per capita incomes downward
from 450 dollars a year.''

The United States should ''either vastly increase its material
assistance to the countries whose troops are trying to stop the
carnage ... or lead the U.N. in supplying troops,'' he said.

A letter to the Post last Friday noted ''historical facts'' the
writer said were missing from the public discourse.

Liberia ''has permitted its flag to be used to build one of the
world's largest merchant marine fleets, including giant tankers,
with the proviso that in the event of war, this fleet would
automatically be placed under the U.S. flag for our use, as indeed
it was,'' According to the writer, Edward K. Moss.

The letter continued: ''Liberia's resources have been supplied
to the U.S., including the world's purest iron ore and rubber
grown in the world's largest such plantation, both under
concessions to U.S. companies.''

Moss also pointed out that the U.S. ''actively supported Samuel
Doe (under whose military regime the war began) for years, with
many times the 60 million dollars we have provided to (ECOMOG) for
more than six years.''

Now, he charged, ''we are piously saying we should let the West
Africans persuade the...warring factions to lay down arms.''

Liberians and several non-governmental organisations (NGOs)
have for several months waged a campaign to get Washington to
dispense more logistic assistance to ECOMOG, which many Liberians
insist must lead the peacekeeping.

The Clinton administration has repeatedly said it is too
financially strapped to provide such assistance. Renewed fighting
and increased pressure led Washington to last week release 10
million dollars for the purchase of helicopters and trucks from
U.S. companies for ECOMOG.

The helicopters have been delivered, while the trucks ''are on
their way,'' Col. MacArthur DeShazer of the National Security
Council told a forum on Liberia organised by the black lobby
Constituency for Africa Thursday.

Liberians at the forum poured scorn on a proposal publicly
promoted by the United Nations special representative James Jonah
that Liberia be placed under U.N. trusteeship.

The tempers were only queslled with assurances from Ellen
Johnson Sirleaf, the U.N. Development Programme's assistant
administrator and director of the regional bureau for Africa.

''I have the latest report of the (U.N.) secretary-general on
Liberia and I can tell you that trusteeship is not in it and is
not being discussed by the Security Council,'' said Sirleaf.

She said that one of three options being considered, is a quick
disbursement by the United States of the 30 million dollars
recently approved by Clinton for ECOMOG, <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a> the force could carry
out the disarmament of troops.

Another option would have Washington send in U.S. troops to
scare the warriors into voluntary disarmament. The third option
calls for a national conference. (END/IPS/RU/YJC/96)

wars. Only the cunning will escape from the 20th century with
doubtful profits.

    BBC radio quotes the US foreign secretary Mr Perry as
appealing to US Allies for support to stop the natural growth of
China into a dedicated, disciplined World Power. He accused China
of being an "Empire Builder" as it took or will take back the
sections of its long-stolen-by-imperialists parts -Hong-Kong and
Taiwan. Its other section- Tibet was taken over with US approval,
conditional on China always supporting the US votes in the UN
Security Council.  Thus came spurious, US democratic murders of
millions of people in every section of the globe, including its
own Black peoples. A pity that the Blacks invaded US lovely living
space in the bad old days!

   For these crimes the American brains trust is now rejoicing
over the happy, contented, disciplined, clever, ecstatically
supportive voter-applause for all their doings over the years.
Their victims would wish the US Admin's to live in sheer hell for
200 years to make up for their ruthless attacks against humanity
and the planet.

   Mr Perry now claims that his ambitious drive for this
assistance from the 'allies' is NOT motivated by US corporate
greed with its WTO, GATT, UN, NATO, CIA, Pentagon, IMF and World
Bank support to reduce the main land areas of the world into US
slavery. Mr Clinton agrees with this in his TV speech to 5000
Coast Guards, in which he stated that (a) The US would supply
C.Guards with the most modern boats and equipment ever heard of,
to protect America from illegal immigrants and the massive drug
supplies that worry him slightly, (b) that he would spend over
$80,000,000,000 dollars to perfect a 'star-wars type' defence
system -which would take 10 years to fix, after which no-one will
ever threaten the USA EVER AGAIN!!?? (Has it ever been threatened
since the Boston Tea Party?) and, (c) He would support American
interests totally and always in their quest for free-trade entry
for exports to every other country, either with peaceful
agreement, or by negotiation based on US (or WTO etc Laws), or by
THE USE OF FORCE if it becomes necessary.

     <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>So</a> watch out Allies! What you have lost to the US already of
your long-time trade outlets is but a sample, as you are whittled
down to Banana Republics. Why? Because like your own politicians,
who will do or sell anything to stay in power for just one more
time, corporate presidents should be drowned at birth, or put on
the rack till they tell Truth about the crimes they have
committed, bribes collected, made to wear a nazi gold cross,
(weight 44 kgs, chained to an ankle) and then finally signed up as
flagellants.

     Like a cancer, US leaders have been allowed to develop a
weird approach to their position, similar to the Japanese gas
supplier in Tokyo, or the religious cult leaders who marry up 5000
couples at the one sitting, or the Jones boy who killed all his
followers in the South American jungle.
     No-one else needs 6 aircraft carriers and a reduced reserve
of 60,000 nukes to win a wheat contract! JC

Angola Peace Monitor
Issue no.9, Volume II 27 May 1996

----------------------------------------
Army amnesty moves opens path to peace

The Government of Angola and the rebel movement Uniao Nacional
para a Independencia Total de Angola, UNITA, on 21 May
completed negotiations on the important issue of the
integration of UNITA military personnel into the Angolan
national army, FAA. This is a key provision of the Lusaka
Protocol. If matched by political will from UNITA, this
agreement paves the way for the disbandment of UNITA's
military forces and the completion of the peace process.

According to reports from the Portuguese radio station RDP
Antena - 1, and the Angolan News Agency, ANGOP, an agreement
has been reached that as from 1 June the selection of military
personnel will begin, with the process ending on 30 July.

No agreement has been made yet over the fate of those UNITA
soldiers not chosen for the national army. The Government
wants them placed in a new Fourth Branch of the military, to
help with the reconstruction of the country. UNITA maintains
that they should be immediately demobilised into civilian
rehabilitation programmes.

On 8 May the National Assembly unanimously passed the Bill
which provides for the amnesty of all crimes against military,
internal state security and related crimes committed by
Angolans since 31 May 1991. This was in response to a new
condition for the integration of UNITA forces into the FAA
raised by UNITA (see APM issue no.8, Volume II).

Last minute rush fails to win applause

At a meeting on 8 May in New York, the United Nations Security
Council unanimously passed Resolution 1055 (1996), extending
the UNAVEM III mandate for a further two months, until 11
July. This is one month less than the previous renewal, in a
sign of greater international pressure on UNITA to comply with
the Lusaka Protocol.

The resolution expressed "profound regret at the overall slow
pace which is far behind schedule" and noted "with deep
concern the failure of UNITA to complete the quartering of all
its troops by 8 May in accordance with resolution 1045 (1996)
of 8 February". It further went on to note "the recent
progress in the quartering of UNITA troops and calls upon
UNITA to fulfil by June 1996 its obligation to complete the
credible, uninterrupted and fully verifiable quartering of its
troops and to turn over to UNAVEM III all its arms, ammunition
and military equipment".

In a dash to meet its self-imposed deadline of quartering
30,000 troops by 8 May, UNITA has moved thousands of its
troops into official UN quartering areas, reaching a figure of
31,500 on 7 May.

The large scale movement of UNITA troops into the quartering
areas in the first week of May has brought a guarded response
from the UN Security Council. Speaking on 8 May during the
debate on the UN peacekeeping operation in Angola, UNAVEM III,
the US Ambassador to the UN, Karl Inderfurth spoke for many
countries when he said that "the last-minute movements of
thousands of troops to quartering areas in the final days
before the renewal of UNAVEM's mandate is typical of UNITA's
pattern of lurching forward in fits and starts towards its
goals. This pattern does not help cement faith in UNITA's
overall commitment to the peace process. It is essential that
UNITA continue the quartering process without further delay or
interruption. Unless real soldiers bearing real weapons are
quartered, the peace process will not move forward".

According to information supplied to ACTSA by the UN
Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Unite in Luanda (UCAH),
as of 15 May, a total of 33,675 UNITA soldiers were registered
at the following Quartering Areas.

Vila Nova       5,007
Londiumbali     5,212
Negage          5,008
Piri/Quibaxe    2,148
N'gove          5,044
Quibala         3,211
N'tuco          1,759
Catala          2,211
Chicuma         2,991
Andulo          1,084

An eleventh quartering area was opened on 17 May at Caiundo,
Kuando Kubango Province, with a twelth due to open on 21 May
at Chitembo, in Bie. Work is still taking place on two further
sites, with the location of the last quartering area still
under discussion.

UNITA promises to quarter 50,000 by 15 June

The UNITA General Staff on 21 May issued a communique in which
they pledged to confine 50,000 troops by 15 June. This
clarifies a statement made by the UN Secretary General's
Special Representative, Alioune Blondin Beye, who said after
a visit to UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi in Andulo on 14 May that
"I am in a position to state firmly that UNITA will resume the
confinement process before the end of this week and it will
confine 50,000 men before 15 June".

Concern raised over those quartered

The Secretary General of the UN, Dr Boutros Boutros-Ghali has
warned that the patience of UNITA soldiers staying in the
quartering areas may be running out.

In his report to the Security Council on 30 April
(S/1996/328), he warned that "desertions from quartering sites
were reported to number about 2,100, but the actual figure is
probably higher, since, on several occasions UNITA commanders
have prevented UNAVEM III personnel from conducting roll
calls. UNITA representatives claimed that desertions were due
to the harsh living conditions in the camps but there is
reason to believe that some of them were covertly sanctioned
by commanding officers and that others involved persons who
had been forcibly recruited by UNITA for quartering. The age
of some UNITA troops and the condition of weapons surrendered
continue to be a major concern."

The Secretary General went on to state that "Complaints by
UNITA, many of which have proved to be largely unfounded, have
been carefully investigated and followed up. The [Joint]
Commission, of which UNITA is a member, has concluded that the
assistance being provided to the soldiers in the quartering
areas is generally adequate".

He continued that "It is disturbing, therefore, that UNITA's
mass media continue to disseminate allegations about
sub-standard conditions in quartering areas".

On the issue of troop morale, he stated that "The soldiers who
arrived late last year at the first quartering areas in Vila
Nova and Londiumbali have now been quartered there for five
months, which is the maximum period originally planned. Not
only is their prolonged stay rapidly depleting United Nations
resources (those allocated for first assembly will almost be
exhausted in May) but discipline in some camps has started to
deteriorate. These factors make it imperative to begin without
delay the gradual incorporation of UNITA troops into FAA and
the demobilization of those who are willing to be discharged."

Government troop quartering "positive"

The Government has received praise from both the Secretary
General and the Security Council of the UN over its withdrawal
to base of its troops.

Writing in his report to the Security Council, the Secretary
General stated that "the major positive development was the
withdrawal of the FAA to their nearest barracks in some
provinces". He also pointed out that the Civilian Police
component of UNAVEM III had "verified the quartering of the
rapid reaction police in Benguela, Huambo, Luanda, Luena,
Lubango, Uige and most recently, in Malange. As of 25 April,
3,605 of the declared strength of 3,745 personnel had been
quartered in these 7 locations. Barracking of those in Saurimo
will commence on 30 April, with those in Cabinda following in
May."

However, this positive view is rejected by UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi, who said in an interview in Le Figaro on 17 May that
"Government troops are only pretending to return to base.
These soldiers and the special police forces, the "Ninjas",
are still threatening our men who are now disarmed".

Meanwhile, the Government announced on 13 May that the second
stage of moving its troops to barracks was to commence,
involving the barracking of 6,000 troops over the following
two weeks. 

UNITA leader hints at accepting vice-presidency

Jonas Savimbi has hinted that he might still accept the post
of Vice-President of Angola, if certain conditions are met, in
an important interview on 15 May in the French daily "Figaro".

The UNITA leader said that "First, the MPLA must accept
integration of UNITA's leaders into a cabinet of national
unity and the Government army. Then, if my party decides that
I ought to accept this offer, I shall do <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a>. But Dos Santos is
both President of the Republic and President of the MPLA. If
I become Vice-President, I will be under the orders of a party
leader, although I will have renounced the presidency of
UNITA. This is barely acceptable. If UNITA decides to send me
to Luanda to take up the role of Vice-President, it should
also elect for itself a new President".

Answering a question on whether UNITA would "keep control of
the diamond producing areas in the northeast of the country,
Savimbi responded that "For UNITA, this is a question of
survival. In 1992 the Government was supposed to finance our
campaign. It did not do <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a>. We therefore had to secure our own
means of finance, because, one day, there will be lots of new
elections, and we must finance the campaign".

The UNITA leader also called for a "transitional Government"
to be in place by November. This is seemingly in contradiction
with UNITA's agreement with the Angolan Government that a
Government of Unity and National Reconciliation should govern
the country until new elections can be held.

Military situation "calm"

The body over-seeing the peace process in Angola, the Joint
Commission, has noted that the military situation in Angola is
relatively calm with no serious military actions registered.
This analysis was confirmed by the Secretary General in his
report to the Security Council, who said that "the military
situation in most of the provinces remained calm, with no
offensives or other significant military actions by either
party".

ACTSA calls for action

Action for Southern Africa, ACTSA, has written to the British
Government, calling for greater international action to be
taken to ensure that UNITA fulfils its obligations under the
Lusaka Protocol.

In a letter to Baroness Chalker, the Minister of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ACTSA Chair Robert Hughes
MP, wrote that "The Security Council must now be prepared to
spell out a set of specific measures that will be taken
against UNITA if it once again fails to comply, within the
period set for the renewal of the mandate, with a minimum set
of provisions; at the very least to include the full and
verified quartering of its troops and the surrender of all
arms, ammunition and military equipment to the UN - as agreed
in the Lusaka Protocol. If such steps are not made, the
Security Council should make it clear what new measures it
will take to ensure the full and effective implementation of
existing UN sanctions on the continuing flow of arms and
petroleum products to UNITA and to block revenues from the
international trade in illegally extracted diamonds which
finances this trade".

In her response to ACTSA, Baroness Chalker wrote that "as you
rightly suggest, further procrastination in the quartering and
disarming of UNITA troops cannot be justified". She continued
that the UN Security Council Resolution of 8 May "renews the
mandate of UNAVEM III only for a period of 2 months, until 11
July 1996, and in this period UNITA will be expected to
maintain the momentum of quartering achieved earlier this
month. If UNITA have failed to make significant progress by
the expiry of the current mandate, this will certainly
influence the Security Council when it next considers the
mandate's renewal".

Government signs agreement with Cabinda rebels

The Gabonese radio station, Africa No 1, has reported that on
15 May in Libreville, Gabon, an agreement on a cease-fire was
signed between the Government and the Front for the Liberation
of the Cabinda Enclave - Cabinda Armed Forces (FLEC-FAC).

Jonas Savimbi to visit Europe

UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi is due to visit Europe at the
beginning of June. He is expected to visit London where
meetings with Government officials are anticipated.

Purpose
--------

In order to promote human rights, improve life options and further the democratic process in Africa in general,
and especially in Zaire, independent media need support for providing objective information to the people.
Since April 24, 1990, the beginning of the democratic process and freedom of press in Zaire, a number of
newspapers have been established. Presently, approximately 300 newspapers and magazines are registered with
the Ministry of Information, but less than 15 of these appear on a regular basis. These 15 have great difficulties
in raising enough money to run their papers, but for the majority of magazines and newspapers the obstacles are
too high and <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> most of them publish irregularly, and then may take another two or three months (or more) until
they are financially able to print another issue.

The estimated circulation of all newspapers in Zaire for one week is between 150,000 and 200,000 which of
course is insufficient for a country of 45,000,000 inhabitants.

Today, many of the magazines that have been established since 1990, have been forced to close since because of
their publishing problems. The most important difficulties are namely lack of basic materials, equipment
(computers, etc.), distribution and printing machines.

Those publications which have survived despite all these material problems, further face threats from the
intelligence services as well as losses due to the looting of big cities organised by the military in September 1991
and January 1993. The publication La Rfrence Plus, for example, was subjected to such losses but wants to
continue its work.

If such publications don't get support, many more will have to close their offices. The democratic process would
be endangered if the election announced for 1997 was covered only by state-run media and without independent
newspapers and magazines on which the people rely.

For such a large country, four times the size of France, in which news is not easily spread from the South to the
North and from the East to the West, newspapers are vital for collecting and publishing objective information for
the benefit of the community. However, the countrys weak transport infrastructure makes it a costly endeavour
to distribute a daily newspaper across the country, which only a few newspapers can afford today. Lack of
vehicles, for instance, often forces one to ship newspapers by plane. The costs involved lead to a situation where
the paper loses money with every issue transported to remote areas. (see annex I).
La Rfrence Plus, one of Zaires biggest newspapers, with more than fifteen offices throughout the country,
proposes to create a new structure in co-operation with the Foundation for International Communication (FIC)
and the Global Alternative Media Association (GAMA), which would be able to offer facilities to independent
media in Zaire.



Rationale
-----------

With the elections to be held before July 9, 1997, to end the five year period of transition to democracy in Zaire,
an operational free press becomes vital for the country.

Building up an infrastructure beneficial to all independent newspapers is a necessity in order to provide an
increased percentage of the countrys population with access to information crucial for their opinion building
process.

Due to obstacles mentioned above, non of the newspapers currently struggling to survive on the Zairian market
will be able to achieve a true nation-wide coverage and distribution out of its own resources within the next year.
Radio transmitter and fax stations, in-the-country based production of cheap pulp and availability of cheap
newsprint are what Zairian newspapers desperately need in order to play their role during the period preceding
the elections. Transport assistance would help to spread the information beyond the boundaries of the capital
Kinshasa and thus enable the rural and provincial population to participate in the election process.
A functioning, independent, responsible and non-aligned press can be a vital protection against demagogy from
any side.

The availability of information lies at the heart of any participatory democracy.
Since it is obvious that the impoverished economy of Zaire will not satisfy these needs within the given time
bound of one year, external aid becomes crucial to achieve the aim of turning Zaire into a democratic state by
means of fair and free elections.

NAIROBI, Kenya--Despite more than 29 years of civil war, with no end in
sight, most Sudanese Christians say they have hope that someday the violence,
homelessness and political instability will end. That hope is not SO much
eschatological or political as it is prophetic, for the resurrection hope SO
typical among Sudanese is tempered by a punitive edge.

SANCTIONS 
In June of last year a group of Egyptian militant Islamists tried to
assassinate their country's leader as he arrived in Ethiopia to attend a
conference. Three suspects are believed to have fled to Sudan, and in January
the United Nations, at Ethiopia's request, gave Sudan 60 days to capture and
extradite the suspects. Last month the Sudanese regime - widely believed to
be sheltering or even directing the militant group - were told that they had
not complied with the UN demands.
The UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Khartoum at the end of April,
and they came into effect on 10/5/96. The sanctions are mild: they require
all UN member states to limit Sudan's diplomatic activity and forbid
international organisations from holding conferences in Sudan.
In March and April Sudanese politicians made desperate efforts to ward off
the more serious bans on arms sales and flights which were demanded by
Ethiopia, the Sudanese opposition and the USA. Sudan succesfully avoided
harsh penalties - Russia, China and Indonesia abstained in the vote, but the
resolution's mildness was really due to Egypt's change of heart on the
matter. Although her president was the target of the assassination attempt,
Egypt did not want to see sanctions imposed on yet another Arab country. Most
of all, Egypt is afraid that the Sudanese regime will lose the war in the
South. An independent South would complicate the issue of Nile waters, and
Egypt has a natural sympathy for the Arab rulers of Sudan in their struggle
to subdue the rebellious South.
The UN also demands that Sudan stop supporting international terrorism -
countries hostile to the Sudanese regime have long claimed that there are
training camps across Sudan where Islamist militants are trained in irregular
warfare. Osama bin Laden, a tall Saudi hero of the Afghan war who happens to
have a fortune of $300 million, is rumoured to pay for much of the training -
he now lives in Sudan. The cloak-and-dagger atmosphere of the whole affair
was heightened when someone claiming to be Mustafa Hamza, one of the
suspects, phoned an Arab newspaper in London from Afghanistan, to say that
none of the suspects were in Sudan, and that he and his friends didn't even
like the Sudanese government.

HUMAN RIGHTS
The UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva issued a condemnation of Sudan's
human rights record in Geneva last month. Dr Gaspar Biro, the UN official
charged with investigating human rights abuses in Sudan, told the commission
that indisputable instances of torture, slavery and other abuses were still
being recorded. The Sudanese regime had banned Dr Biro from visiting Sudan
after his 1994 report, which made explicit reference to the inconsistency
between Sudan's Islamic law and Sudan's obligations under human rights
treaties which it has signed. This was taken as an affront to the faith, but
the regime is now trying to come to terms with Dr Biro again.
(Sudan News 11/4/96; Sudan Democratic Gazette 5/95)

FIGHTING IN THE EAST
The war in Sudan is spreading to the north. The Beja lands, which lie along
the Red Sea and the Eritrean border, in the east of Sudan, saw an armed clash
between the regime's forces and soldiers of the Beja Congress. The Beja are a
group of non-Arab Muslim tribes who have been alienated from the stridently
Arab culture and militant Islam propagated by the regime, which has allegedly
confiscated land from Beja farmers and given it to its own supporters.
Another armed group operating around the Eritrean border is the Sudan
Alliance Forces. They belong to the opposition National Democratic Alliance,
which groups together southern rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army and the
traditional Islamic oposition parties of the Arab north. Unlike the northern
establishment, the SAF is strongly secularist. But it enjoys the favour of
the SPLA and the Eritrean government.
A British journalist in Eritrea saw the SAF train with AK-47 rifles in
Eritrea, aiming at targets adorned with the photograph of Hassan al-Turabi,
the leader of Sudan's Islamists. The army, led by Brigadier Abdul Aziz
Khaled, claims to have killed 15 government troops at a garrison over the
border in April. Eritrea has promised to help organisations trying to
overthrow the militant Islamist regime.
The SPLA managed to get to the southern borders of the Arab north of Sudan in
March, but it has never managed to organise a war in the north. Its northern
allies might make a difference.
(Sudan Democratic Gazette 5/96; Guardian 11/5/96)

SADIQ REFUSES TO SPEAK
The Muslim feast of sacrifice [ 'id al-'adha] commemorates the sacrifice of
Ishmael, the Qur'an's version of the biblical story of the sacrifice of
Isaac. This year it fell at the end of April, and as usual al-Sadiq al-Mahdi,
Sudan's former prime minister and leader of the banned Umma party, led
worship at his family's Wad Nubawi mosque in Omdurman. The Mahdi family is
the most important in all Sudan, and in Sudan's complex religious politics,
has the allegiance of the Ansar, or followers of the Mahdi, a religious sect.
This time al-Sadiq refused to make a speech, calling on a relative, Abdel
Mahmoud Abo, to issue a denunciation of the government's handling of politics
and the economy, and its recent agreement with two small groups of Southern
rebels. He also attacked some of the novel interpretations of Islamic law
which the country's militant rulers employ to serve their interests.
Al-Sadiq, who has been derided in the past with the nickname Abu Kalam [the
father of talk], refused to speak, in fulfilment of a vow he made at the end
of Ramadan, no longer to call for a peaceful solution to the country's
current crisis.

WAR AND PEACE
Last month the Sudanese government signed a peace agreement with two
factional rivals of the rebel Sudan's People Liberation Army. The two groups,
led by Riek Machar and Kerubino Kuanyin, signed a Political Charter with
vague provisions for a referendum for the South, but with a firm commitment
to the unity of Sudan.
The charter was denounced as empty treachery by John Garang's SPLA, the main
rebel faction, and its Ugandan, Eritrean and Ethiopian allies. The SPLA
always maintained that their rivals were agents of Khartoum. The SPLA has
refused a number of peace overtures from Riek Machar over the past few months
- he split from Garang in 1991 accusing the latter of dictatorial vices.
Machar leads a loose alliance of commanders mainly from his own Nuer tribe.
His area has seen the success of grass-roots peace initiatives, perhaps made
possible by his more open approach to government. One of his commanders,
William Nyoun, rejoined Garang last year, but was recently assassinated by
another Machar commander.
Kuanyin has long been regarded as a brutal agent of Khartoum, but some
observers sympathise with Machar, who had to choose between surrender to
Garang, who refused all offers of reconciliation - and between this agreement
with a discredited and desperae government. By choosing to ally himself with
Khartoum, Machar and his mainly Nuer supporters do not have to submit to
Garang's authoritarianism. The Nuer and other tribes in Upper Nile can hope
for greater independence of actions as clients of Khartoum than they can as
subordinates of Garang.
It is hard to interpret the agreement's significance - it may allow the
tribes of Upper Nile, geographically and historically closer to the north and
to Ethiopia, space and time to get on with life in the midst of a long
running conflict; it may help the government at a time when it faces military
and diplomatic catastrophe; it may weaken the increasingly powerful SPLA war
machine, backed by the US and African countries. But it will certainly place
almost intolerable pressure on the church, the only group that brings
together Southerners from all tribes. Machar's tribe is mostly Presbyterian,
while Garang's supporters tend to belong to Evangelical, Catholic and
Anglican churches. Through five years of inter-factional fighting in the
South, the churches have made a united stand against cruelty and tribal
hatreds. This stand will now be tested again. See PRAYER

PRAYER
Bishop Paride Taban, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Southern
Sudan, recently appealed to all Christians to rise above tribal identities
and work together to build a nation where love and justice would prevail
everywhere:
In [the epistle to] the Hebrews, it is said God sent people to keep the words
of God, but nobody listened and they suffered a lot.  And Jesus Christ came
also to tell them the same message, yet nobody took him seriously. In Sudan
there are prophets prophesising to their people: you reconcile, you forgive,
you be a nation, you be the sons and daughters of one family, but nobody
listens, he said. The Bishop pointed out that since 1991 the church had been
prophesising to the people of Southern Sudan on the need for togetherness,
telling them that if they would not reconcile among themselves they could
lose more lives, but this went on deaf ears.
(NSCC News 2/96)
Please pray for the churches and Christians in South Sudan who must confront
the fats of violence between rival Southerners; pray that they might be able
to hear God calling them to peace and reconciliation.

WHAT PEACE FOR THE NUBA?
This was the title of a London conference last month. Ian Mackie, one of our
members, was a speaker and he sent us this report on the proceedings:
The conference proved to be an effective occasion in which a range of issues
concerning the Nuba people were highlighted to a gathering of about 100
people. The aim was of course to project the situation to a wide audience, by
means of the range of people who attended. The Foreign Office, at least two
embassies and a number of organisations concerned with the state of Sudan
were represented, <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> it may be presumed that the aim was achieved.
The day's programme began with a number of contributions on the politics and
history of the situation and went on to cover the war's impact on religion,
women's and human rights. Media coverage of this terrible and inaccessible
conflict was also discussed.
My own contribution dealt with what I consider to be the basic issues which
will affect the Nuba once a change comes to the Sudan: namely restoring their
rights to their traditional lands in a way that will clearly define their
future. The existing government sponsored agricultural developments gather
small family farms into large plantations which are sold to the government's
supporters. The indigenous inhabitants are driven off their lands, and return
to them only as cheap or slave labour. This must be replaced by systematic
allocation of land to individual free-hold farmers, and the providing of the
basic infra-structures to make this possible. I stated that this could be
achieved at not too great cost, and once done, it would contribute to the
prosperity of the Sudan, as well as that of the Nuba.
In the present very difficult situation the above would seem to be only
wishful thinking, but not <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a>! Throughout the day I was able to detect some
spirit of optimism because the present government's position was shown to be
tenuous, and bowed beneath the burden of its own cruelty and injustice.
Change will of course come - and among the possibilities raised was that of a
federal Sudan, in which a Nuba State could make a contribution to overall
national government.
I was most impressed by young people present who, at personal risk, had not
long since returned from the Nuba Mountains and who could speak of the
unbroken spirit of the Nuba whom they met. It can be taken as certain that
all the attempts at genocide and obliteration of the Nuba name have failed,
and the tolerant Nuba - Christian, Muslim or Animist - will rebuild their
communities and their culture; and shall be an example to others!
Prayer is never misplaced nor does it ever fail: the need for continuing
prayer for the Nuba was never more plain.

HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN
The Sudanese Victims Of Torture Group has expressed its grave concern for the
safety of 36 people illegally detained at Kober Prison. The regime's security
services have allegedly set up a secret torture centre or "ghost house" in
this old Khartoum prison. It is believed that a great number of these
illegally detained people are suffering from various problems, such as skin
problems, joint problems or breathing problems (asthma). They include one
child, Mohmed Hussain Ali, a 14 year old student.
Please write to the Sudanese authorities urging them to:
- take the appropriate measures to guarantee the safety of Mohmed Hussain Ali
and his 35 adult companions and order their immediate release if they are
being detained without valid charges or, if such charges exist, bring them to
a fair trial.
- guarantee a full, impartial enquiry into the facts, concerning the supposed
illegal detention of all the persons above mentioned, identify those
responsible, bring them to trial, and punish them according to the law
- ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms in accordance with national laws and international standards

THE WAR DRAGS ON, BUT SUDANESE CHRISTIANS REFUSE TO GIVE UP HOPE
by Alexa Smith
NAIROBI, Kenya--Despite more than 29 years of civil war, with no end in
sight, most Sudanese Christians say they have hope that someday the violence,
homelessness and political instability will end. That hope is not <a name=L10004></a><a href=#L10005>so</a> much
eschatological or political as it is prophetic, for the resurrection hope <a name=L10005></a><a href=#L10006>so</a>
typical among Sudanese is tempered by a punitive edge.
Many Sudanese understand the words of the eighth-century BC prophet in Isaiah
18 to be a prediction of Sudan's current torment - and the coming redemption
of its "tall and smooth" people who are "feared near and far." Those words
bring both comfort and conflict to thse who are trying to make sense of the
persistence of evil, because the same God the Bible depicts as suffering with
the people is also understood here to be testing the helpless faithful -- and
punishing the faithless -- in the midst of the seemingly endless war.
"Everything has failed. Everything you can think of humanly has failed," said
the Rev. Haruun Ruun, executive director of the New Sudan Council of Churches
in Nairobi, about the violence that persists in Sudan between tribes and
between armies. "The only hope people have is in God who created them ... in
the Holy Spirit who gives strength and courage to stand up and endure the
situation - not just now, but tomorrow and next year. "There seems no end to
it." The New Sudan Council of Churches consists of Protestant, Catholic and
Pentecostal churches in the areas of southern Sudan controlled by the
Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA), which is fighting the
fundamentalist Islamic government in Khartoum for self-determination for the
largely black Christian and animist people of the south.
To date, more than 1.5 million Sudanese have been killed and at least 5
million more are refugees, who pour into makeshift camps outside Khartoum
that are routinely bulldozed back down into the dry Sahara that surrounds the
capital of the once-united country. In the south, people hide in moveable
villages deep in the bush. They hide not only from government troops, but
from one or both of the rebel armies that are fighting each other to control
southern Sudan's people and its much coveted natural resources, including
vast supplies of timber and oil. "This is not a new thing ... <a name=L10006></a><a href=#L10007>so</a> we will
endure it," argued a minister in Khartoum, who said the biblical narratives
tell of a God who allows suffering and somehow redeems it - from the
wandering of Hebrew ex-slaves in the wilderness to the nailing of Jesus to
the cross at Golgatha. But he refuses to raise questions about why the
warfare persists because, he said, there is also resurrection, and that means
no problem is hopeless. "Why should the people of Israel suffer for 40 years?
Why only Israel at the time? Why not other nations? When a problem comes to
you, you wonder, Why me and not others?'" And yet he insists that God allows
evil to happen, and even if a biblical prophecy predicts unavoidable
disaster, there is still hope for a yet unseen future.
Trying to make sense of the sheer persistence of evil is nothing new to
Africans who have, for centuries, had to wonder why there is <a name=L10007></a><a href=#L10008>so</a> much
suffering, according to Dr. Setri Nyomi of Nairobi's All Africa Conference of
Churches. Both traditional African religions and some strains of Christianity
have left behind legacies of divine punishment that often re-emerge when
theodicy is broached.
Nyomi told the Presbyterian News Service that most of Africa would say God
allows - but does not cause - evil. "The question is more What are we called
upon to do?' than Why is this happening to us?' Whether or not God allows
evil to happen is secondary," he said. But whether God actually inflicts
hardship as some sort of punishment or simply allows the consequences of
human sin to hold sway, even over the innocent, is where the debate gets
murkier. And it does prompt questions among those who continue suffering year
after year.
"Will God only punish the poor people but not the rich people in Sudan? Will
God only punish the black race but not the brown race in Sudan? It is a
conflict in our minds," said one southern Sudanese pastor, stressing that
most of the war has been fought in the south, displacing people and
destroying twns and fields. "We may not be the first people to ask this: If
God is just, why is this happening?' This question is in the minds of my
people. ...
"But," he said, drawing on scriptural stories, "to find blessing from God
involves some suffering and pain. ... Although God is just and everything
comes from him, there are also times when God wants to test us." But it is a
short step from a God who tests the faithful to one who punishes the
faithless -- particularly when the source of the quandary is a prophet's cry
of impending doom for people who have forgotten the God who delivered them
from Egypt. While some Sudanese attest that humans do evil and cause horrible
suffering, others understand God to be the source of all things.
"We accept this [war] on us as maybe from our sin - this is punishment being
done to us ...," one theological student told the Presbyterian News Service.
"We also have to examine why this punishment is given through the hands of
other people. Sudanese really know what Isaiah preached ... the Sudan."
The Rev. Paul Bol, executive secretary of the Presbyterian Church of Sudan
(in southern Sudan), said the Bible is clear about how the sins of the father
bring punishment to the children. "Adam and Eve," he said, "disobeyed and sin
fell to everybody in this world simply because they are Adam and Eve's
ancestors."
The tension between God's mercy and wrath is one the prophets well
understood. But most Sudanese preachers preach love: how to live together
though the world seems to be crumbling, how to trust that the church in other
parts of the world has not forgotten them, how to believe that the vision of
God is more powerful than the great struggle that has swallowed Sudan,
Africa's largest country.
"There are times when our faith is brought into question," Ruun told the
Presbyterian News Service. But he points out that despite Sudan's horrific
problems, the church -- virtually the only stable institution left in
southern Sudanese society -- is growing enormously. "There are times when you
see the grace coming in ... and you begin to see light in spite of the
difficulties. Somehow you see that grace ... and it gives hope. ...
Ruun explained that worship in Sudan is jammed because people have watched
human solutions fail over and over. "They don't see any other solution," he
said. "But they see hope and solution in God."

Title: CAMEROON-AGRICULTURE: Capital Becomes Garden City

By Tansa Musa

YAOUNDE, May 26 (IPS) - Time was when the city folk of Yaounde
viewed farming as something done by barefooted villagers in the
countryside, but a decade-long economic crisis has changed this
perception.

Thousands of residents in the capital, struggling to make ends
meet, are trying their hands at agriculture as a means of reducing
their food bills.

Barnabas Akahkuh is one of this new breed of city dwellers.
At six each morning, he and his wife Emilia head for the 1.5-ha
farm located a kilometre away from their Yaounde home and work
there for at least an hour before taking off for work at the
Ministry of Education.

''My farm has been of great help to me,'' says Akahkuh. ''It
greatly reduces the expenses I would have regularly incurred on
such foodstuff as maize, cassava, sweet potatoes and other food
which I could have hardly afforded on my lean salary.''

In the past, urban agriculture had been discouraged by
officials of the ministries of health and environment, who saw
farms in towns as breeding grounds for mosquitoes, snakes and
rodents. Now they admit that urban farming has instead helped to
clear the bush around this equatorial city, where it takes just a
few weeks of rain to turn a vacant lot into a thicket.

Urban agriculture is part of a worldwide trend. U.N. statistics
show, for example, that some form of agriculture is practiced by
65 percent of Moscovites, 67 percent of Nairobi residents and 80
percent of the people in Kinshasa.

Up to 90 percent of the vegetable supply in China's towns is
produced by their inhabitants, while urban agriculture satisfies
for 95 percent of Israel's food requirements.

While there are no figures on urban agriculture in Yaounde,
government officials estimate that the number of farmers in the
Cameroonian capital runs into thousands. They range from the
unemployed to public servants forced to supplement their meagre
salaries.

Handson Ghandi, for example, is a Finance Ministry official. He
told IPS he no longer spent money on foodstuff such as 'njama-
njama', a leaf vegetable which, boiled, mixed with palm oil, salt
and pepper and eaten with boiled cornmeal, is a popular dish in
northwest Cameroon.

''I hardly go to the market today to buy 'njama-njama','' he
said, ''My farm provides 'njama-njama' throughout the year for my
house needs and some of my friends have also come to harvest from
my farm.''

He also harvests at least 10 jute bags of maize, about seven
bags of cassava and five of sweet potatoes from his farm each
year. In between harvests, the family also eats the sweet potato
and cassava leaves.


''There is nothing you can do to stop me from going to my
farm,'' said Ghandi. ''In fact, if I could acquire more land here,
there would be nothing to stop me from quitting the public
service, which has become a big waste of time ever since salaries
were slashed.''

Most farmers in Yaounde have had more time to devote to their
farms since 1994, when government changed the two-shift working
day into one which now runs from 07.30 to 15.30 hours (local
time). In reality, though, most people report for work around
09.00 and leave by 14.00 hrs.

''Our work schedule ends every day at 3.30 p.m.,'' explained
Akahkuh. ''Once my wife and I reach home and have something to
chew, we leave immediately for the farm. Moreover, we spend all of
Saturday and early Sunday morning on the farm instead of just
sitting around and drinking beer like most Cameroonians.''

Some urban farmers started long before the current wave of town
farming. Kenneth Njeta says he began about 10 years ago. In the
first eight years he still depended on the maize sent to him by
his mother, who lives in their home village. However, for two
years now, he grows all the corn he eats.

Agricultural extension workers are encouraging more city folk
to go into farming and depend less on the state to improve their
living conditions.

Martha Yingui, agro-technician in the communication cell of the
Ministry of Agriculture says ''many people still imagine that
because you live in urban areas you cannot practice farming for
your family consumption or for sale due to lack of space or
land.''

They fail to realise, she explains, that farming in towns can
can be practiced in many places, including waste land, swamps, the
grounds of large buildings and on rooftops.

According to a U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)
consultant in the ministry of agriculture, urban farming can help
solve the problem of hunger, especially for the urban poor who
spend a great percentage of their income on food.

It can also be a means for civil servants to put their many
idle hours to use, he said, adding that urban farming could
increase the use of garbage as organic manure and that could help
keep municipalities clean. (END/IPS/TM/KB/96)

Title: /BULLETIN OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS 03/ MOZAMBIQUE: Holy Row Over Holy
Days

By Mercedes Sayagues

MAPUTO, May 21 (IPS) - A holy row has erupted in Mozambique over a
Bill that makes public holidays of two Muslim festivals,
highlighting the country's political and religious divisions.

President Joaquim Chissano is under intense pressure from the
Muslim community and the Catholic and Protestant churches over the
draft law which will make Eid-ul-Fitr at the end of the fasting
month of Ramadan and the Eid-ul-Adh at the end of the Hadj, the
annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, public holidays.

Chissano has until the end of May to return the controversial
Bill to the National Assembly which passed it in early May for
revision, or let it pass automatically by raising no objections.

On Apr. 24 he met with delegates from the Christian Council and
the Episcopal Conference of Maputo, who urged him not to approve
the law.

Outspoken Cardinal of Maputo, Dom Alexandre Maria dos Santos and
Anglican Bishop Dinis Salomao Seguleme want a return to the
'tolerancia de ponto' whereby Muslims could stay away from work on
holy days.

But Nazir Lunat, a deputy of the ruling Front for the Liberation
of Mozambique (Frelimo) and mullah at Polana mosque in the
capital, points out that the 'tolerancia de ponto', ''in reality,
it was not tolerated as a holiday.'' Under the system, schools
were open, exams taken and business meetings scheduled Muslims
ended up having to work on holy days.

However, Catholics and Protestants emphasise the unfairness of
the proposed law which they argue will put one religion above
others and force all citizens to observe its holy days.

This is a particularly sore point as, soon after independence in
1975, Frelimo turned Christmas into a lay holiday known as Family
Day in its now abandoned socialist zeal.

''This is an ill-judged step that undermines peace and harmony
among all Mozambicans,'' says Anglican Bishop Dinis Salomao
Seguleme. ''This is a maneuver of politicians because there is no
coherence between defending the lay State, as all MPs say they do,
and legislating on holidays of a religious nature.''

The parliamentary leader of the opposition Mozambican National
Resistance (Renamo) Raul Domingos agrees: ''It is an interference
of the state on religious matters, and the State is lay, according
to article nine. The law privileges some citizens over others,
discriminates on religious grounds, damages social harmony and
national unity, all of these prohibited in our constitution.''

Dos Santos, who opposed Mozambique joining the Organization of
the Islamic Conference in November 1995, slams the Bill as the
harbinger of Muslim extremism in the country.

''Islamic fundamentalism has created problems everywhere and we
don't want Mozambique to have those problems,'' says the Cardinal.
''Little by little, we are seeing its entrance here: from
demanding holidays to imposing the sharia or Islamic law,
fundamentalism will come.''

Lunat warns that fundamentalism reacts angrily when attacked, as
happened in Algeria and Egypt: ''The more you fight it
(fundamentalism), the more it revolts,'' he says. ''We are saying
(to Catholics) don't shoot the first shot. If you shoot first, you
will bring problems.''

Lunat contends that secular States do observe religious holidays,
citing Catholic festivities in Portugal or Muslim festivities in
Tunis, India, Iraq, Egypt: ''These are lay States but respect the
major religions of the country.''

Although the Bill is the brainchild of 59 Muslims or their
sympathisers across party lines, ultimately it was supported fully
only by Frelimo and opposed by the opposition Democratic Union
(UD) and Renamo with some abstentions.

Domingos considers the Bill a ploy by Frelimo, largely popular in
the south, to increase its support in the northern provinces,
where Renamo performed well in the 1994 elections. He describes it
as a ''hunt for the Muslim vote.''

Muslims constitute nearly 20 percent of the population of 16
million, according to a 1991 demographic survey by the National
Directorate of Statistics. Twenty-four percent of Mozambicans are
Catholic, 21 percent Protestant, 32 percent Animist and the
remainder a sprinkling of Hindus and other religions.

But as the survey covered only major urban centers because of the
civil war which ended in 1994, it is believed that the proportion
of Muslims should be revised upwards to include rural people in
the northern provinces of Niassa, Cabo Delgado and Nampula, where
easily more than half are Muslims.

There is an economic side to the issue as well. At stake may be
credit, investment and humanitarian aid from the wealthy Gulf
States for a country still listed by the World Bank as the world's
poorest, as it battles to recover from the 17-year war.

These countries could be lured by Mozambique's economic
potential.

This possibility is lent credence by last week's visit of
Kuwait's minister of tourism, seen with his retinue lounging in
flowing white robes and checkered keffiyas in the lush gardens of
the Hotel Polana.

A Western diplomat in Maputo notes that foreign funds must be
paying for the proliferation of mosques across Mozambique, with 23
in the capital alone.

Lunat is a mullah at the first mosque to be built in an upper
class residential area here. Without being asked, he is at pains
to explain that no foreign funding is involved.

While the debate rages, a creative alternative to the celebration
of holy days has been proposed by independent journalist Carlos
Cardoso, editor of the daily faxsheet 'Mediafax'.

He suggests that Family Day should be floated on a ten-year cycle
to coincide with holy days for all the major religious
denominations.

''In this way, in the course of a lifetime, Catholics,
Protestants, Muslims, Hindus and Animists would see Family Day
fall on their sacred day,'' says Cardoso, believing that Family
Day would then become a factor of unity rather than division.

Title: FRANCE-AFRICA: French Intervention Shows Old Habits Die Hard

By Angeline Oyog

PARIS, May 27 (IPS) - Human rights bodies and observers of French
relations with Africa have watched with dismay and disapproval
this past week as Paris sent troops into the Central African
Republic to battle on behalf of a government facing revolt.

As fighting subsided in the capital, Bangui, French troops began
negotiations both with the beseiged government of Ange-Felix
Patasse and mutinous army soldiers.

''France is putting bets on both sides, as it had done in other
countries in Africa like Chad,'' said Bruno Barrillot, defence
analyst at the Centre for Documentation and Research on Peace and
Conflict.

''It is evaluating the balance of forces to avoid being chased
out of the Central African Republic and to keep intact its
presence in the continent.''

The negotiations came after French troops engaged in direct
combat last week with rebellious army soldiers while protecting
the national radio station and the residence of President Patasse
against assaults.

These events were a sequel to the occupation by 200 Central
African army soldiers of barracks in central Bangui on May 18 as
they revolted against a Presidential order to disarm them. The
soldiers had staged a mutiny earlier in April over months of
unpaid wages.

According to analysts, the participation in the fighting and the
defense of the Central African President by the French troops,
mobilised to evacuate French expatriates and other foreign
nationals, had given France's intervention in Bangui political
colours.

''We condemn the French intervention in the Central African
Republic,'' said Robert Fallay, director of the Brothers of Man
non-governmental organisation (NGO).

''If France has to evacuate French and foreign expatriates, it
would have been comprehensible, but not when it goes beyond that.
Central Africa was not facing an external aggressor, but an
internal trouble,'' Fallay added.

The French government had explained its actions by claiming to
defend a President elected by its people and ''to maintain the
democratic system''. Elected in 1993 in polls pushed by France,
Patasse has nevertheless slid in popularity and gained notoriety
for corruption.

''That Patasse was 'democratically' elected cannot justify
France's interference in another country's internal affairs. It is
not for France to decide whether Patasse or any other President
stays or not. I can't imagine the French people approving being
told by Africans whether Jacques Chirac should stay or not,''
Fallay said.

For observers of French-African relations, however, defending a
democratic system was hardly the basis for the French action.

''The Central African Republic hosts two of the most important
French military bases in Africa and serve as springboard for
actions in the Central African region as was the case for
Rwanda,'' stressed Barrillot.

''Other important bases are found in Senegal and Djibouti and
together they allow France's reach in Africa to spread all over
the continent,'' he added. ''France is extending its influence
even throughout English-speaking Africa and drawing up agreements
of military cooperation.''

Military cooperation and defense agreements between France and
its former colonies and other countries in Africa have long been
denounced by private groups and NGOs as the backbone of
undemocratic and dictatorial regimes.

Accords for military assistance have been passed with some 23
countries in Africa and in the Indian Ocean and defense agreements
with eight providing the presence of military assistants, the
training of African soldiers in French military schools and the
supply of hardware.

Defense accords allow French intervention in case of an external
threat. According to Barrillot, however, the problem is, there are
''secret clauses'' that are not made public and ''which allows one
to do what it wants''.

Researchers say France has conducted some 30 interventions in
Africa since the 1960s when most of the defense agreements were
drawn up. The latest were Operation Turquoise in Rwanda in 1994
and an intervention during the coup d'etat in the Comores islands
in October 1995.

The French intervention this week in Central Africa, said
Barrillot, is also a showcase of the implementation of France's
project to trim down and professionalise its army.

A professional army, said Barrillot, would be designed for easier
and more rapid external interventions that could degenerate into
interference in countries with defense agreements with France.

''There are big risks that a professionalised French army would
make it easier to interfere in a country's internal affairs.''

''It can be conceivable that French troops be part of an
international peace-keeping or peace-making force, under the
banner of the United Nations for instance,'' said Barrillot.

''But if they start interfering directly, the French army becomes
nothing more than a neo-colonial army,'' he said.

Title: SUDAN-MEDIA: And Then There Were None

by Nhial Bol

KHARTOUM, May 27 (IPS) - Sudan's last independent daily has been
closed following a raid by an unidentified group of armed men who
seized the newspaper's plates, a year's supply of newsprint, and
20,000 copies of the paper awaiting distribution.

'Rahi al Akhar' (Alternative View Point) editor-in-chief, Mohi
Eddin Titawe, told IPS that the men who stormed his office Friday
looked and behaved like armed ruffians.

''Without providing any official paper as to who issued the
orders of the confiscation, these gang (members) entered our
building and told us to leave. We all quit the place at gun
point,'' a still shaken Titawe said.

The paper's journalists and workers have been ordered to stay
at home until a decision is made as to whether the paper will be
allowed to re-open.

''I don't know whether this was an act of a gang, a government
body, or a group of people who could drop in armed with pistols,
rifles and threaten journalists and take away all the copies and
plates for their own needs,'' Titawe said.

''I have not been notified as why this paper was closed or
suspended,'' and added that he believed his life is now in danger.

When Gen. Omar Hassan al Bashir overthrew Sudan's elected
government in 1989, one of his first acts was to shut down the
independent press. The restrictions were relaxed only in 1995,
allowing two private papers to operate, ahead of state managed no-
party general elections in March this year.

Then earlier this month, 'Akar Khabar' (The Last News) was
banned, followed last week by 'Rahi al Akhar', leaving just two
government-owned papers publishing in a country of 28 million
people.

''Relations between... the private media (and the government)
is going from bad to worse,'' commented former minister of
information, Ali Shammo.

He said the raid on 'Rahi al Akhar' proved the government was
opposed to a private press carrying independent views.

A security official told IPS that 'Rahi al Akhar' had over the
past few months repeatedly run anti-government stories in which
opposition groups were allowed to express their views in a country
where political parties are banned.

One report last week, said to have ruffled official feathers,
attacked a recent peace deal between the government and two rebel
factions which Bashir has trumpeted as a significant step towards
ending the country's 13-year secessionist civil war in the south.

Taking a more cynical view, the paper pointed out last Thursday
that the main rebel group, the Sudanese People's Liberation Army
(SPLA), had condemned the <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a>-called Political Charter and went on
to suggest that its signing by the two dissident groups were due
to their failure on the battlefield.

According to security sources though, the final straw was the
paper's claim in its seized Friday edition that 95 soldiers,
detained for their alleged role in an abortive coup and jailed in
Ed Dueim, 200 kms south of Khartoum, had rioted and seized control
of part of the prison.

The ministry of the interior, while accepting a revolt had
taken place, denied that there were any political prisoners in the
jail and the disturbances were due to inmates protesting over
delays in their appeals being heard.

Titawe however stands by his account. ''We got the story from
our experienced journalist in the area, the government should not
hide the truth from its citizens.''

''Despite the closure of our paper and warnings to our life, I
am prepared to take the issue anywhere. The revolt was led by the
coup-makers who have not been tried yet and is not a rumour nor
was it hear-say,'' he insists.

Over the weekend, the government-run Press and Publication
Council, responsible for the media here, announced that the paper
had been closed as a security measure and would be allowed to
resume next month if it denied the prison story. On Monday it then
said that 'Rahi al Akhar' had been suspended for violating press
laws.

The Council's release said the Ed Dueim report was harmful to
army morale and the paper should have checked with the ministry of
the interior over the incident and should have published the
ministry's denial.

''I am 57-years-old and this is the right age to accept the
truth, let them do whatever suits their needs but we cannot
publish a denial,'' Titawe said. ''Instead, I want them to come
and arrest me or take me for interrogation any time.''

<h1>SR-16</h1><h2>16 Bit Stereo Drum Machine</h2>
<hr>
The SR-16 Stereo Drum Machine is an excellent tool
for songwriting and perfomance. It features a great
selection of 233 realistic, natural drum sounds, offered
both in dry form and sampled with our incomparable digital reverbs. Our exclusive Dynamic Articulation feature
enables a drum sound to change its tonal content as
it's played harder for truly realistic performances. The
SR-16 features 50 preset patterns that were actually
played in by top studio drummers - not just programmed
and quantized. You'll find enough built-in rhythmic variations
(with A, B and two Fill sections) for composing
complete arrangements .Of course, the SR-16 also provides complete MIDI impIementation, a footswitch input,
flexible programming and editing features and velocity-
sensitive pad buttons. Plus, it's so easy to use that
you'll be up-and-running and composing new music in
minutes.

<h1>WAVE</h1><hr>
The Wave is an instrument that inspires an emotional
reaction from all who encounter it. When you first see
the Wave (which won the Nordrhein Westfalen Design
Center's Intemational Award for Quality in Design), it
leaves you with the unshakeable impression that this
device is truly unique. Its no-nonsense control features
provide instant, intuitive access to the heart of the
Wave Synthesizer, the Wavetable Engine, with up to 96
oscillators, 96 wavetable generators, 48 analog
multimode filters and the option of analyzing and
editing sounds, right down to the smallest audio atom.
The Wave's large graphic display illustrates every
function graphically and numericaIly for every type of
operation and provides you with a transparent view of
the links between the internal modules. The word
compromise used in conjunction with the Wave is a
contradiction in terms. In addition to its unrivalled audio
quality, it provides you with intuitive access to sounds
that in the past were onfy possible via the dassic
modular systems .This is no coincidence, since the Wave
is also a modular system. When you purchase a Wave,
you know your investment will be safe in the long run.
The Wave features an upgradeable number of voices (16
in the basic version, up to 48 voices in the top-of-line
version). We also now offer exclusive Custom Line
versions and you can have us build a Wave to your
specifications. We will continue to support you and your
one-of-a-kind Wave with, for instance, future hardware
upgrades, and when you consider how impressively the
Microwave itself has retained its value, you can be sure
that the Wave is an instrument with lasting impact that
will remain at the cutting edge of music.<p>
<hr>
<h2>CUSTOM</h2>
The exclusive Wave Custom Line facility offers you a
Wave built to your very own personal specification.
Each Custom Line Wave can be assembled exactly as
you want it from the following unique options:<br>
<hr>
Need more Wave power? With its modular hardware
layout, the number of voices inside your Wave can be
increased from16 in the basic version up to 32 or even
48 voices in the Custom Line versions by simply
plugging in 1 or 2 <b>PLUS16 voice expansion</b> sets.<br>
<hr>
61 Keys not enough? One of our most requested
Wave features is now available. <b>MoreKeys</b> means the
addition of exactly 15 keys (a grand total of 76), some
in the lower and some in the upper area of the
keyboard (from E to G). The width of the MoreKeys
casing is 1340 mm, only154 mm more than the basic
61-key version. All MoreKeys Waves, as an added
feature, also include a professional flightcase.

Subject: Eindelijk erkenning milieu-ramp Put van Weber?
Date: Tue, 2 Jul 1996 22:08:55 GMT

R.I.D. doet onderzoek:
Roemruchte Put van Weber  voor zwemmen gesloten.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Op de grens tussen IJsselstein en Nieuwegein ligt een grote waterplas,
al zolang ie bestaat de 'Put van Weber' geheten.
De plas is eigenlijk een zandafgravingsput, op sommige plaatsen meer
dan 30 meter diep.
En waarschijnlijk zou het er nog dieper zijn, ware het niet dat de put
jarenlang gebruikt is voor het storten van afval. 'Bouwafval' volgens
de officiele lezing en dan met name sloopafval van de stadsrenovaties
in de nabije gelegen stad Utrecht.

Maar elke al wat oudere IJsselsteiner weet dat het daar niet bij
bleef: sloopafval hoeft niet 's nachts gestort te worden en.. zit ook
niet in vaten.
Vrachtwagenchauffeurs die destijds betrokken waren bij het storten van
'bouwafval'  houden hun kaken op elkaar en hebben nooit met je
gesproken als je over de put begint.

Zomer '83 vond een forse milieuramp plaats in de put die met de
grootst mogelijk spoed en soms weinig frisse middelen zoveel als maar
kon in de doofpot is gestopt. 
Officiele lezing van de ramp: tijdens de bouwvakantie zouden per
ongeluk de beluchters zijn stilgezet die het zuurstofarme water van
zuurstof moesten voorzien en zo voorkomen dat de zgn 'rotte
eieren-geur' aan de oppervlakte zou komen.
Een paar jaar eerder had een dergelijke ramp plaats gevonden in
Groenekan, waar eenheden van 4 werden gemeten. In '83  werd er in de
put maar liefst een eenheid van 22 gemeten.  (oude eenheden, pal na de
ramp in IJsselstein zouden de meeteenheden veranderen).
Vooral in de IJsselsteinse wijk IJsselveld vielen slachtoffers. De
wijk ligt nl. aan de rand van IJsselstein aan de kant van de put, de
richting waar ten tijde van de ramp in 83 de wind  vandaan waaide.
Kinderen klaagden dagenlang over keelpijn, mensen met
luchtwegaandoeningen werden in ziekenhuizen opgenomen.

De ramp werd bestreden door lozing van een volle tank ijzerchloride.

Onofficiele metingen maakten daarna melding van een onvoorspelbare
chemische kettingreactie..

De Put en omgeving staan al jarenlang in de planning om
recreatieterrein te worden. Desondanks werd er in de tachtiger jaren
een vergunning verleend voor het schonen van vervuilde grond van
elders in het land en is doorgegaan met storten van bouwafval, ook op
het land, waardoor inmiddels voor recreatiedoeleinden 'leuke' heuvels
zijn ontstaan.

In 1995 is de Put min of meer officieus als recreatieterrein geopend:
de warme zomer nodigde vele mensen, vooral jonge Nieuwegeiners die
onbekend zijn met de geschiedenis van de Put, uit tot zwemmen.

Dat schoot in het verkeerde keelgat van de IJsselsteinse Stichting
Mens en Milieu die al jaren ijvert voor meer openheid van zaken. De
stichting weet zich inmiddels gesteund door de Recherche Inlichtingen
Dienst.
De R.I.D. is bezig met een onderzoek naar de gang van zaken rond de
Put.  Hoewel het onderzoek nog niet is afgerond heeft de R.I.D. deze
week wel een zwemverbod gelast.

the preface: 

"Predictions on the future of extreme weather cannot be given,
but easonably plausible scenarios can be derived, through which
society's sensitivity can be analysed. The most crucial
determinant of the impact of changes in extreme weather events
appears to be adaptation. Although single events can be dramatic,
the average impact of changes in the investigated hazards (river
floods, extratropical storms, tropical cyclones, agricultural
droughts, subsidence, heat waves and human health) can be
manageable with appropriate climate change foresight and adequate
implementation of adaptive measures. However, these two
presumptions may not be fully met, in which case the risks to
society can increase significantly. Given the many and great
uncertainties, the most appropriately adapted systems are those
which are robust to a range of possible futures. Reducing
vulnerability requires a thorough analysis of specific systems at
risk, and more investment in infrastructure and institutions then
is presently the case."

"This book is an examination of Texas climate. It studies the
weather patterns of the Lone Star State as they have occurred
over past years, and it seeks to predict future climatic
conditions as they may happen in 50 to 500 years, incorporating
factors such as planetary surface warming, regional population
density, and water demand. Further, the book predicts what these
future changes will mean to the human and natural systems of the
state. The studies collected in this volume grew out of a
conference held at Texas A&M University in 1993 and were written
by leading geographers, meteorologists, engineers,
geomorphologists, agricultural economists, oceanographers, urban
planners, political scientists, and wildlife scientists."

announcement issued by the Public Broadcasting System: "The first
episode looks at the beauty of clouds and the destructive power
of rain. It follows weather watchers who roam the globe to
photograph the glorious images of clouds. The program visits
Colorado's Thompson Canyon, where survivors of a fatal flood in
1976 share their stories, and Lynmouth, England, which was
destroyed in a flash flood. Families whose worldly goods were
carried off by Mississippi River floods are also interviewed.
Finally, the program travels to Bombay to speak with the owner of
an umbrella factory. For her, the yearly monsoons create a

of four episodes in the Savage Skies series. According to an
announcement issued by the Public Broadcasting System: "Episode
two pursues tornadoes and lightning. First the program looks at
storm chasers, individuals who live to encounter the weather that
most people dread. Among them are Antonio, a Brazilian whose one
dream before he dies is to see a tornado, and Marty Feely, a
Texas tornado-broker who is determined to track down a twister
for Antonio. The program illustrates how destructive tornadoes
can be by re-creating a fatal day in 1991 when a family of
twisters wiped out a Kansas town. The second half of the episode
tells amazing stories of lightning, including incredible footage
of an Air Force pilot being repeatedly struck by bolts of
lightning as he flies through thunderclouds in a jet." Tapes are

Skies: Monsters of the Deep, Video (VHS), 1 hour, 1996. The third
of four episodes in the Savage Skies series. According to an
announcement issued by the Public Broadcasting System: "The third
program recounts the massive destruction caused by Hurricane
Andrew. First-person accounts and home video records of helpless
families reveal the awesome power of the costliest natural
disaster ever to hit the United States. The program also travels
with hurricane chaser Richard Horodner and talks with Bob
Simpson, the man who made the first research flight into the eye
of a hurricane. Finally, the program looks at the relationship
between the mysterious Pacific Ocean current, El Nino, and the
dramatic weather phenomenon it causes all over the world." Tapes

Thirteen/WNET New York and Granada Television (producers), Savage
Skies: The Winter's Tale, Video (VHS), 1 hour, 1996. The last of
four episodes in the Savage Skies series. According to an
announcement issued by the Public Broadcasting System: "The final
episode focuses on snow, beginning in Oimyakon, Siberia, the
coldest town on Earth, where the air is so cold it can rip apart
a child's lungs and pens won't write because the ink freezes
solid. The program travels to Buffalo, New York, to investigate
`lake effect snow,' a unique phenomenon in which snow is born
over Lake Erie and dropped on the neighboring metropolis.
Residents will never forget the blizzard of 1977 that paralyzed
the city for weeks. But if snow is a curse in Buffalo, it is a
religion in Vail, Colorado, where skiers worship it. The program
then travels to Scotland to hear incredible first-person accounts
of people who have nearly been killed by mountain snow. Among
those interviewed are survivors of the blizzard that buried
Dartmoor, England, in 1963, and the weather watchers perched atop
Mt. Washington, New Hampshire. Tapes are available for $19.95

Subject: MICHIGAN MAN INFECTED WITH MALARIA
Date: 31 May 1996 20:42:02 -0800 (PST)

from Global Change Electronic Edition...
                                
               MICHIGAN MAN INFECTED WITH MALARIA
  Higher temperatures and humidities raise disease threat in US

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that a 31-
year Michigan man was hospitalized in early September 1995 with
malaria. According to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report (MMWR) (pp 398-400, 17 May 1996), the disease probably was
transmitted by a locally infected mosquito of the genus Anopheles
carrying the malaria parasite (of the genus Plasmodium). The
authors report that mosquito-borne malaria has not been
transmitted and recorded that far north in the United States
since 1972.

The article, "Mosquito-Transmitted Malaria -- Michigan, 1995,"
cites several factors in support of its conclusion that the
patient acquired malaria in Michigan from a local mosquito. These
factors include above normal temperatures in Michigan during the
month of August 1995 when the man probably was bitten by the
insect. The area's average evening temperature that month was
24.2oC (75.6oF), about 3.3oC (5.9oF) above the 30-year average.
The authors write that the higher temperatures "may have
facilitated malaria transmission because warmer external
temperatures shorten the reproductive (sporogonic) cycle of the
parasite and prolong Anopheles spp. survival."

This is not the only recently reported case of malaria
transmitted in the US from mosquitoes. In the January-March 1996
issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, the CDC's Jane R. Zucker
reports on recent (1986-1994) outbreaks of malaria in California,
New Jersey, New York and Texas. "A common feature of all recent
outbreaks has been weather that is hotter and more humid than
usual," Zucker writes in "Changing Patterns of Autochthonous
Malaria Transmission in the United States: A Review of Recent
Outbreaks."

Malaria once was endemic in many parts of the US. But incidence
of the disease apparently peaked in the late 19th century and by
the 1950s the CDC concluded it had been eradicated. Since that
time, nearly all reported cases of malaria in the US were among
people infected outside the country. In Michigan, for example, an
average of 30 imported malaria cases are believed to occur
annually. From 1957 through 1994, only 76 cases of malaria are
believed to have been locally transmitted by mosquitoes in the
US.

WARMER TEMPERATURES INCREASE DISEASE RISK

The spread of the disease begins with favorable breeding
environments for the mosquitoes: sitting water and mild
temperatures. Next, infected humans must be available. In the US,
most of the available human hosts originally picked up the
disease outside the country from areas where malaria is endemic.
After the insects draw blood from infected humans, the mosquitoes
cannot transmit malaria unless they live long enough for the
malarial parasites to complete their sporogonic cycles within the
mosquitos. Zucker explains that infected mosquitos in the US
rarely transmit malaria partly because their lifespans are often
shorter than the sporogonic cycles.

But this situation can change dramatically as air temperatures
rise. For example, below 16-18oC (61-64oF), the malaria parasite
P. vivax cannot complete its sporogonic cycle. At about 18oC
(64oF), the cycle takes 30 days. With just a 2oC (4oF) increase
-- to 20oC (68oF)-- the cycle is cut by 1/3 to 20 days. And at
27oC (81oF), the cycle only takes 8-13 days. 

At the same time, higher temperatures -- and humidities -- help
mosquitoes develop and survive. So warmer temperatures and higher
humidities, through their dual effect on both the parasite and
the mosquito, can greatly increase the risk of malaria
transmission.

US MAY SEE "REEMERGENCE OF MALARIA AS A SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH
PROBLEM"

In testimony before the Congress on 9 March 1993, Patrick J.
Michaels of the University of Virginia, said that "one very
reliable set of data (though limited to the coterminous United
States) indicated that almost all [climate] warming had taken
place at night" and reassured the Congress that this was "benign
climate change." Michaels, a Professor in the Department of
Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia, is a
notorious and vocal critic of what he has called "the current
popular vision of climate gloom and doom." 

More recently, a publication edited by Michaels (World Climate
Report, 29 April 1996) claimed that "recent outbreaks of tropical
diseases can't logically be attributed to global warming." The
publication says that even with warming "malaria's impact will be
greater in undeveloped countries," adding parenthetically (and
incorrectly) that "malaria was wiped out in Europe and the United
States in the 1800s."

Despite such reassurances from Michaels and others, the recent
outbreaks add to mounting evidence which suggest that climate
warming, even if concentrated at night, may be far from benign.
In fact, nighttime warming may be particularly problematic in
some respects, since mosquitoes feed mostly at night. And among
disease-transmitting insects, the World Health Organization (WHO)
warns in The World Health Report 1996, "the mosquito is the
greatest menace." The WHO, which estimates that 2.1 million
people died in 1995 from malaria alone, adds that "the effects of
climate change may allow some diseases to spread to new
geographical areas." 

Speaking specifically of the US, Zucker cautions that
environmental changes along with greater drug resistance and air
travel "could lead to the reemergence of malaria as a serious
public health problem" in the US. The warning is supported by
recent research results which suggest climate change may produce
conditions in North America which are much more favorable to the
spread of malaria. And unlike residents of areas where malaria
presently is endemic, most people in the US have little or no
resistance to the disease.

What measures can be taken to deal with the emerging threat?
Researchers reported last year in the CDC's MMWR (pp 295-303, 21
April 1995), that "[i]mportant strategies for preventing the re-
establishment of malaria as an endemic disease in the United
States are prompt recognition and reporting of cases of malaria;
appropriate treatment of all malaria cases...and implementation
of appropriate control measures."

IMPACTS
Consequences of Climate Change and Ozone Depletion ... 
   
   MICHIGAN MAN INFECTED WITH MALARIA. Higher temperatures and
   humidities raise disease threat in US. The Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention report that a 31-year Michigan man was
   hospitalized in early September 1995 with malaria. The disease
   probably was transmitted locally by an infected mosquito.
   Mosquito-borne malaria has not been transmitted recorded that
   far north in the United States since 1972.(1 June, 1996) 

ECONOMICS
   
   CENTER FOR GLOBAL CHANGE RELEASES STATE CARBON TAX MODEL. The
   Center for Global Change at the University of Maryland has
   produced a model which "provides a reasonable estimate of the
   revenues from a state carbon tax, their distribution among
   fuels and sectors, and the direct burden on households." (1
   June 1996) 

OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION
   
   CENTER FOR GLOBAL CHANGE: PUBLICATIONS. The University of
   Maryland's Center for Global Change closed its doors on 31 May

   Atmospheric Research and Information Center of the Manchester
   Metropolitan University (Manchester, UK) continues in 1996 to
   post 4-6 news "snippets" on global change each month. The most
   recent stories are dated April 1996. (posted 1 June, 1996) 
   
   GUIDE TO IPCC-RELATED PUBLICATIONS. Includes the latest
   information on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's

Subject: IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT PUBLI
Date: 31 May 1996 20:42:24 -0800 (PST)

from Global Change Electronic Edition...
IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT PUBLISHED

The most recent publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) is its Second Assessment Report (SAR),
approved by the IPCC in late 1995. Like its First Assessment
Report (1990), the SAR was prepared by three working groups. 

Working Group I analyzed "the functioning of the climate system
and potential changes to it resulting from human activities."
Working Group II assessed "potential impacts of climate change,
adaptation strategies, and measures that could be adopted to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions." Working Group III focused on
the economic implications of climate change, a task which
involved "assessing potential economic damages and the
applicability of cost-benefit analysis to decisionmaking."

Each working group has produced two documents: a full technical
report and a brief Summary for Policymakers. Each pair of Working
Group documents has been published as separate volumes of the SAR
by Cambridge University Press:
   
   Working Group I: Climate Change 1995; The Science of Climate
   Change. Edited by J.T. Houghton et al. 400 pp. Hardback $90,
   Paperback, $34.95. 
   
   Working Group II: Climate Change 1995; Impacts, Adaptations
   and Mitigation of Climate Change: Scientific-Technical
   Analyses, edited by R.T.Watson, M.C.Zinyowera and R.H. Moss.
   890 pp. Hardback, $95.00. Paperback, $35.95. 
   
   Working Group III: Climate Change 1995; Economics and Social
   Dimensions of Climate Change. Edited by J. Bruce, Hoesung Lee
   and E. Haites. 458 pp. Hardback, $80.00. Paperback, $29.95.

LIVE PROGRESS REPORTS on the CLIMATE TREATY NEGOTIATIONS

ECO Climate Change Newsletters
Live and direct from the UN climate negotiations

COP-2 in Geneva 
Monday 8th to Friday 19th July 1996

Every day or two for the next two weeks you can receive your own copy of
ECO direct from the second "Conference of the Parties" (COP2)
ministerial-level meeting of the Climate Change Convention (signed at the
Earth Summit in Rio, 1992).

**** APC USERS NOTE: Full text of these newsletters will be posted to
     the climate.news and climate.forum conferences ****

ECO is:

the definitive source - it's what government negotiators and journalists
alike read to find out what's really going on at the negotiations.

Produced and written by the Climate Action Network (consisting of over 160
Non-Governmental Organizations from around the world), and distributed
electronically worldwide, ECO's contributors include leading independent
scientists and political analysts, giving you unrivaled access to the
negotiations and what they really mean.

Countries are currently negotiating a protocol to the Convention, which
will set out how greenhouse gas emissions are to be limited after the year
2000. The Protocol must be agreed by 1997, so the Second Conference of the
Parties represents a key stage in the process. ECO, as always, will be
helping participants and observers keep up to speed on the latest
developments.

Subject: Nuke Explosion During Waste Transfe
Date: 04 Jun 1996 14:11:42 -0500 (EST)

             EXPLOSION AND FIRE AT POINT BEACH NUKE PLANT
 
Loading of spent nuclear fuel into dry storage containers was
suspended at Point Beach (WI) Nuclear Plant following an explosion
during a welding procedure May 28.  According to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) initial report, at 2:45 am on May 28th,
an unidentified gas ignited inside a fully-loaded cask of nuclear
waste containing 14 tons of spent fuel rods, causing an explosion. 
The explosion occurred just prior to the welding of the 9 inch
thick cask lid that weighs about 4,400 pounds.  The explosion
inside the cask lifted the 2 ton lid, leaving it tipped at an angle
with one edge 1 inch higher than normal.  There were no injuries.
 
The NRC has suspended further loading of nuclear waste casks until
it can determine the cause of the accident and whether any spent
fuel rods were damaged by the explosion.  Each 18 foot high cask is
loaded with 14 tons of radioactive waste, including 170 pounds of
plutonium.  Each loaded silo contains the equivalent radioactivity
of 240 Hiroshima-type explosions.  According to U.S. guidelines,
the waste must be kept safe for 10,000 years.
 
The explosion confirms environmental groups' concerns that the
VSC-24 dry cask storage system has not been sufficiently reviewed
to protect public health and the environment.  This radioactive
waste storage explosion demonstrates the real threat to the Great
Lakes ecosystem.  For more information contact: Eleanor Roemer,
Lake Michigan Federation, (312) 939-0838.

The panel report from the federal environmental assessment hearing
on the proposals by Rio Algom and Denison Mines to "deommission"
the uranium mine tailings areas in the Elliot Lake basin (north
shore of Lake Huron, northeastern Ontario) by flooding them will is
expected to be submitted to the federal Minister of the Environment
on June 14, and released to the public on June 19. 
 
Copies of the panel report can be requested from the panel manager
Brian Torrie, at tel 810 997 6364 of fax 819 994 1469; address is
Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, 13th Floor, Fontaine
Building, 100 Sacre-Coeur Boulevard, Hull, Province de Quebec,
Canada  K1A 0H3.
 
The panel report should be loaded into the agency's home page
(<a href=http://www.ceaa.gc.ca>http://www.ceaa.gc.ca</a> but that will probably take some time.

NUCLEAR AWARENESS PROJECT SUBMISSION 
TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 
ON THE TOPIC OF MIXED-OXIDE (MOX) FUEL USE 
IN CANDU REACTORS AT BRUCE "A"
 
 
U.S. Department of Energy
Office of Fissile Materials Disposition
P.O. Box 23786
Washington D.C.  20026-3786  U.S.A.
 
BY FAX: 202-586-2710   
 
 
June 6, 1996
 
Submission to the U.S. Department of Energy Regarding the 
"Storage and Disposition of Weapons-Usable Fissile Materials 
Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement"
 
Capacity Factors and Reliability of CANDU Reactors
 
The Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) proposal assumes that
the four Bruce "A" Nuclear Generating Station reactors will be
retubed regardless of whether or not the mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel
scheme is implemented, and that these reactors will operate at an
average capacity factor of 80% for a further 25 year period.
These assumptions are inappropriate, given current debates about
the future of the electricity sector in Ontario, and given
operating experience at CANDU reactors. 
 
The AECL Final Report "Plutonium Consumption Program - CANDU
Reactor Project" notes:
 
"It is assumed for the purposes of this study that the Bruce NGS
A units will be retubed because there is a demand for
electricity."(1)
 
Retubing is the rebuilding of a CANDU reactor core where all fuel
channels are replaced at a cost now estimated by Ontario Hydro at
about $350 million per reactor.(2) The DoE should note that the
Bruce reactor 2 was shut down in 1995 to avoid this cost and
other major repairs, primarily to steam generators. The other 3
reactors are scheduled for retubing starting in 2000, but could
instead by shut down at that time. The Bruce "A" Station began
operations between 1977 and 1979. It is unlikely that Ontario
Hydro will be able to justify the expense of retubing its aging
reactors when faced with increasing competition in the
electricity sector. 
 
The AECL Final Report also notes:
 
"... it is assumed that during the 25 year mission time the
average capacity factor of the units is 80%, which is generally
consistent with Ontario Hydro's experience..."(3)
 
A review of capacity factors for CANDU reactors in Ontario shows
that the 80% capacity factor target is not realistic. Bruce "A"
is approaching 20 years of operation, and trends show that CANDU
reactor performance deteriorates with age. The 1994 annual and
the lifetime capacity factors for the Bruce "A" Station are shown
in Table 1.

Nuclear Generating Station.(4)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
The Pickering "A" Station is a case in point, since the four
Pickering "A" reactors were retubed between 1983 and 1993.
Reactors 1 and 2 were retubed prior to 1990, and post-retubing
performance averaged only 70% for the five year period from 1990
to 1994. See Table 2.

The degree of over-optimism and actual error in AECL's two
assumptions about reactor rehabilitation and performance
expectations brings into question the validity of all of the
findings in the AECL Report.
 
Costs and Subsidies
 
The total gross cost for using plutonium fuel in CANDUs is
estimated by AECL at over $2.2 billion (1993 U.S.$). This price
does not include the cost of retubing the Bruce "A" reactors or
improving security at the Bruce site. The price of plutonium fuel
production and shipping is estimated at $70 million per year ~
about three to four times the cost of CANDU uranium fuel. It has
been reported that Ontario Hydro representative John Luxat has
said that the DoE will pay the difference between the cost of
CANDU uranium fuel and mixed-oxide fuel, estimated at $54 million
per year.(6) Yet the budget presented by AECL for this project
doesn't mention any subsidies to Canada or Ontario Hydro from the
DoE. What is the DoE's policy on subsidizing utilities which use
MOX fuel made from DoE plutonium? 
 
If the DoE does not pay for retubing and security improvements at
Bruce "A", then Ontario rate-payers will have to pay those costs,
which could easily approach $1 billion to retube and rehabilitate
2 reactors and `harden' the Bruce Nuclear Power Development
against terrorist attacks. This is in addition to paying what it
would cost to use CANDU uranium fuel, and the usual operation,
maintenance and administration costs, as well as capital
modification costs associated with the reactors. This is not a
bargain for Ontario electricity rate-payers, as is being implied
by Ontario Hydro ~ it is a burden. Other cheaper and safer energy
supply and demand management options are readily available. The
pressure to implement full cost accounting and integrated
resource planning in decision making on electricity options will
only increase as Ontario shifts into an era of increased
competition in the electricity sector. It is likely that reactor
rehabilitation will not be economical compared to these other
options.
 
Spent Fuel Management and Burial
 
The end result of using plutonium fuel in CANDU reactors under
this proposal is that foreign military radioactive waste would
remain in Canada. From the environment community's point of view,
accepting radioactive waste from a foreign country would set a
dangerous precedent. The issue of high level radioactive waste
burial in Canada is currently being reviewed by a Federal
Environmental Assessment Panel.(7) The current proposal, put
forward by AECL, involves burial of the wastes in the Canadian
Shield. Many reviewers, including the Atomic Energy Control
Board, Environment Canada and the Panel's own Scientific Review
Group, found significant technical deficiencies in the AECL
proposal, which took almost 15 years to prepare. Canadians are
far from achieving consensus on the best management strategy for
nuclear fuel wastes, and there has been no public consultation on
the option of accepting foreign wastes for burial here.
Therefore, the assumption in the DoE PEIS, that "Spent fuel
generated by a CANDU reactor would be accommodated within the
Canadian spent fuel program"(8) is unwarranted and premature.
Nuclear Awareness Project certainly does not support the storage
or burial of foreign radioactive wastes in Canada.
 
Canada's Non-Proliferation Policy
 
The use of plutonium fuel would violate the spirit of Canada's
non-proliferation stance, which is intended to isolate the
Canadian nuclear industry from the military nuclear weapons
programs of other countries. This plutonium fuel scheme would
integrate Canada into the nuclear weapons program of the United
States through: 1) making Ontario Hydro a commercial recipient of
military fissile material; 2) undertaking security measures
within Canada for fissile plutonium of foreign origin; and 3)
providing radioactive waste disposal for foreign decommissioned
nuclear weapons. Nuclear Awareness Project supports the
maintenance of a clear separation between Canadian nuclear
programs and the military nuclear programs of foreign powers. 
 
Environment and Public Health Hazards
 
The operation of CANDU reactors in Ontario causes negative
environmental and public health impacts due to routine emissions
of radioactive pollution, especially tritium, which is found at
levels far exceeding `background' in the vicinity of all CANDU
reactors. See the attached excerpt from Nuclear Awareness
Project's Spring 1996 newsletter "Tritium Hits Port Elgin" for
details of a recent incident at Bruce "A" (Attachment A). 
 
The possibility of severe accidents at the Bruce "A" reactors
cannot be ruled out, and the risk becomes greater as the reactors
age. Such an accident would likely impact the entire Great Lakes
basin. The enclosed excerpt from the "Nuclear Hazard Report
1991 - 1992", addresses some of these reactor safety concerns in
detail (Attachment B). A major concern is the risk that trade-
offs are being made between safety and maintenance and capital
costs, as outlined in section 3.1 of the "Nuclear Hazard Report".
 
The AECL proposal is incomplete in a key area that concerns
public safety. Plutonium fuel can become "critical" under certain
conditions. Transportation and handling accidents could be
disastrous for those exposed to radiation. The AECL proposal
fails to provide details of the circumstances under which this
may happen and how each situation might be prevented or
mitigated. AECL simply notes that:
 
"Accident scenarios with MOX fuel may be postulated which could
lead to criticality concerns. These range from accidental
immersion in light water during transportation... The complete
range of such accidents would be analyzed as part of the
licensing basis for MOX operation, however, based upon a review
of some scenarios no difficulties are foreseen."(9)
 
To leave a full assessment of criticality risks to the licensing
stage is unacceptable. The AECL proposal fails to address any
accident conditions, only outlining some possible storage
configurations to show how the fuel would behave under normal
conditions.
 
There is no guarantee that the plutonium fuel scheme will undergo
an environmental assessment at either the provincial or federal
level. An exemption was granted to the Bruce "A" Station in 1976
under the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act, and the use of
MOX fuel may come under this exemption. The undertaking would be
regulated by the Atomic Energy Control Board, which may not
require a public hearing under Canada's Environmental Assessment
Act. Nuclear Awareness Project is concerned that every effort
will be made by our governments at the provincial and federal
level to avoid an environmental assessment on this proposal. We
believe that it is unacceptable for the DoE to be considering the
MOX -CANDU reactor scheme in the absence of a firm commitment
from the government of Canada to conduct a comprehensive
Environmental Assessment with full public hearings under the
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.
 
Public Notification and Access to Information
 
Nuclear Awareness Project was pleased to receive the U.S.
Department of Energy's "Storage and Disposition of Weapons-Usable
Fissile Materials Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact
Statement", and have the opportunity to comment. However, it was
only through a conversation with colleagues in the U.S. that we
knew about this Environmental Assessment at all. To the best of
our knowledge the DoE did not provide notification to the
Canadian public about this review process. Certainly Ontario
Hydro and AECL made no effort that we know of to inform the
Canadian public of this opportunity to comment on their proposal.
We hope you will give due consideration to our comments, even
though the DoE is not accountable to Canadians. 
 
Nuclear Awareness Project has been aware of the proposal to use
mixed-oxide fuel containing weapons-grade plutonium in CANDU
reactors since 1994, and began requesting a copy of the proposal
that year. After over a year of run-around and unfulfilled
promises by Ontario Hydro to provide the document, it was
requested formally under Freedom of Information legislation.
Ontario Hydro refused to release the report and instead, directed
us to obtain a copy from the U.S. Department of Energy. The DoE
eventually directed us to AECL Technologies Inc. in the U.S., and
a "Controlled Copy" of "Plutonium Consumption Program - CANDU
Reactor Project" was received in April 1996. Ontario Hydro and
AECL have deliberately withheld vital information on the MOX fuel
proposal as long as possible in order to stifle public debate.
This is unacceptable behaviour from any corporation, let alone
provincial and federal crown corporations.
 
Ontario Hydro has also been uncooperative in releasing
information on other aspects of the proposal, such as public
opinion polls. Nuclear Awareness Project requested a copy of the
results of a public opinion poll conducted for Ontario Hydro on
the plutonium fuel issue in 1995. The script of the poll was
released, however, Hydro refused to reveal the results and
analysis, under the Freedom of Information Act, noting: "The
survey will be used in Federal Cabinet policy discussion. Release
of the survey would interfere with a fair and unbiased Cabinet
review of the issues". Hydro's reply also noted that: "...
release of the survey could generate negative news coverage that
would affect the economic interests of Ontario Hydro."(10) 
 
Conclusion
 
Nuclear Awareness Project does not support the importation of
plutonium fuel for use in the Bruce "A" Nuclear Generating
Station for the following reasons:
 
* in order to use MOX fuel at two reactors, the Bruce "A" Nuclear
Generating Station will require in the order of $1 Billion in
repairs and security upgrades which would have to be paid by the
electricity rate-payers of Ontario; 
 
* the Bruce reactors are otherwise likely to be shut down early,
saving capital repair costs, as well as operating, maintenance
and administration costs ~ electricity can be supplied, or demand
managed more cost effectively;
 
* the use of MOX fuel would set a precedent for Canada to become
a dumping ground for foreign military radioactive waste, an
undesirable prospect for many Canadians;
 
* the use of MOX fuel would reverse Canada's longstanding non-
proliferation policy of isolating itself from foreign nuclear
weapons programs;
 
* the use of MOX fuel would create unprecedented security
problems to prevent theft or diversion of plutonium;
 
* the use of MOX fuel would pose a public health and environment
threat, since plutonium is one of the most carcinogenic
substances known, and there is a risk of criticality accidents.
 
Therefore, Nuclear Awareness Project urges the Department of
Energy to rule out the option of using CANDU reactors located in
Canada for plutonium disposition purposes. We believe that a
better alternative would be immobilization of the plutonium
within the United States.

Pervomaisk (South-Ukrainian Nuclear power  Plant),  June 1,  -
All the  cities  in  the 30 km zone around South-Ukrainian NPP
are cleaned up by disactivating substances. It's possible that
South-Ukranian Nuclear Power Plant have released a big  amount
of  radioactivity  to  the  atmosphere  on  May  27, - special
correspondent reported  from  Pervomaisk,  a  small  city   is
located in 32km from the NPP.  It's a tradition in Ukraine  to
cleanse cities   by   disactivating  chemicals  after  serious
accidents with radioactivity  release  from  NPP,  but  nobody
knows is it helping anybody. It wasn't any press-release  from
plant or state officials following accident days.

re:
URANIUM MINING
NUCLEAR TESTING

URANIUM MINING
On 24thMay'96, people around Australia demonstrated against the
plans of the conservative Howard government to open more uranium
mines.

In Sydney, at 5pm, between 500 and 800 people met outside Sydney
Town Hall, under the auspices of the Stop Uranium Mining
Coalition. (SUM) They were addressed by Senator Dee Margetts of
the W.A. Greens, and speakers from SUM, Trade Union, and Student
groups.  They then marched down from the town hall, down George
Street, to the headquarters of ERA (Energy Resources of
Australia), where they were addressed by Senator Bruce Childs of
the Labour Party, George Adjitjondro from Indonesia,  and John
Hallam from friends of the Earth.

Similar gatherings took place in Melbourne, where as many as 1500
people marched after being addressed by Democrat Senator Meg Lees,
in Brisbane, in Adelaide, in Perth, and in Darwin where a petition
was presented to the Minister for mines.  The demonstrations were
marginalised in print media reporting, but obtained fairly good
electronic media coverage - a common pattern in Australia.

Since then things have continued to be busy on the uranium and
nuclear front.

The Aboriginal Traditional Owners of the Jabiluka uranium deposit
dropped a bombshell on government plans to mine at Jabiluka by
getting the Northern Land Council to write to the Minister for the
Environment to the effect that they oppose the project. Senator
Robert Hill,  Minister for the Environment, had previously stated
that aboriginal approval would be essential for the project to
proceed.  According to the NLC letter:

"....The Land Council has met extensively over the last few weeks
with relevant Aboriginal people to discuss the Jabiluka project
generally and in particular, ERA's proposed changes to the
Jabiluka project . Those proposals are set out in a document of
four volumes entitled 'Jabiluka-2 Project Scope Outline' dated
March 1996, which has been provided by ERA to the NLC."

'The Aboriginal groups are not prepared to agree to any change to
the original proposal to mine upon which is based the 1982 mining
agreement under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory)
Act 1976 between Pancontinental Mining Limited, Getty Oil
Development Company Limited, and the Northern Land Council. The
Aboriginal groups are opposed to ERA's proposals for changes to
mining and milling at Jabiluka and in particular, the proposal to
mill Jabiluka ore at the existing Ranger mill. Indeed, they do not
want the Jabiluka mine to proceed at all."

"....I note that the original environmental impact statement for
the Jabiluka project was prepared in 1979.  The passage of
seventeen years clearly renders that statement inadequate as a
basis for making proper decisions, and request that you assist in
ensuring that an up-to-date environmental and social impact
statements are prepared before any mining is permitted to proceed.
Any such assessments will be materially flawed  in not
meaningless, if not undertaken independently and by processes
acceptable to all parties..."

There are number of important points here. The fact is that  a
proposal for a project, then to be undertaken by Pancontinental
Mining and Getty Oil, was approved in 1979, and an agreement
arrived at under some pressure, between the Northern Land Council
and Pancon in 1982.  The proposal agreed to was however, so
different from the proposal that Energy Resources of Australia
wants to pursue, that it is in effect a completely different
proposal.

The Traditional Owners of  Jabiluka, via the NLC, have let it be
known that they neither want to consider a new proposal, nor do
they want to consider renegotiating the old 1982 proposal.  This
means that the entire Jabiluka proposal has been effectively
thrown into a legal morass. (See appended letter to Senators Hill
and Parer from FOE on Jabiluka Project Scoping, where the wishes
of the Jabiluka T.O.'s are referred to, and the Orebody No3 Press
release)

In related developments, the Senate Select Committee on Uranium
mining and Milling has now held preliminary meetings and has
called for submissions, by July 5th.  Hearings will take place
later in the year, possibly in September/October.  Clearly, the
social impact of uranium mining, the consideration that has driven
the Jabiluka TO's to oppose any new uranium project, will be a
crucial consideration at the Senate inquiry, along with the
questions of local and regional environmental impact,  and
bilateral safeguards in the Senate inquiry's terms of reference.

NUCLEAR TESTING
The Nuclear testing issue was again placed on the Australian
agenda by the Chinese test of 8/6/96. Prior to the actual test, a
vigil had already taken place in front of the Chinese consulate on
World Environment Day, in the knowledge that a test could be
imminent, organised by the Wilderness Society's 'Endangered Tibet'
Campaign, Friends of the Earth, and Amnesty.

The test itself saw a response on Sunday 9/6 in front of the
Consulate by Greenpeace, and again on 10/6 (just in case they
didn't get the message) by the Stop uranium mining Coalition and
the Wilderness Society Endangered Tibet campaign and the
Australia-Tibet Council. The Chinese consulate in Sydney is
getting to be a popular spot for demonstrations!  (See enclosed
press release 'Stop Chinese Nuclear Testing' 10/6/96' and letter
re Chinese testing to Alexander Downer)

The Government responded to its credit, by carpeting the Chinese
ambassador almost immediately, and on Monday10/6, by making a
formal protest in Beijing.  A phonecall to the Foreign Minister
Alexander Downers advisers suggested that a consensus of sorts has
arisen as par as Chinese testing is concerned: Both the
conservative government, and the peace and environment movements
see the current program of testing on the eve f the signature of a
CTBT as entirely counterproductive, and have called on Beijing to
desist immediately and to sign a genuine zero-threshold CTBT
immediately without provision for PNE's. The Downer ministerial
office opined to me that a CTBT that provided for PNE's would not
be worth having.

The question is however, just what they will do about the planned
US hydronuclear testing program. If US senators can write to Mr
Clinton asking him to cancel that program so, it seems, should
Australia.

FRIENDS OF THE EARTH PRESS RELEASE 16/5/96

OREBODY-3 APPROVAL AT RANGER URANIUM MINE 'PREMATURE' SAYS F.O.E.

Friends of the Earth have called on the Federal and NT Governments
to put the approval and development of Orebody-3 at the Ranger
uranium mine on hold until the Senate Select Committee on uranium,
recently set up in the Senate as an initiative of the W.A. Greens,
and the environmental review process for the Jabiluka uranium
project are complete. It was announced yesterday by the Northern
Territory Minister of Mines and Energy Mike Read, that his
department has granted approval for Energy resources of Australia
to mine Orebody 3, within the existing Ranger project area.

 According to FOE uranium spokesperson John Hallam:  'Approval for
Orebody Three at this point by the NTDME is highly premature. We
are about to enter two parallel processes of environmental
assessment which will have to consider the cumulative impacts of
all uranium mining operations for the whole region, namely the
formal environmental impact assessment for the development of the
Jabiluka orebody,  under the procedures of the 'Environment
Protection-Impact of Proposals' Act, and the recently created
Senate Select Committee on Uranium Mining. The Senate Select
Committee will be looking at all aspects of the nuclear fuel
cycle, but will be concentrating especially on the impacts of
mining in the Kakadu National Park. As such, it will have to
consider the cumulative impacts of all uranium mining activities,
including not only the new Jabiluka project, but Orebody-3.'
'While it is true that Orebody-three was included in the original
environmental assessment done under the Ranger Inquiry of 1975-77,
the fact is that Orebody-3 does have some special problems,
notably that it is directly under Djalkmara billabong, and will
therefore have to be de-watered extensively. This will require the
removal of Djalkmara Billabong. According to an article by Dr.
K.A. Bishop in the Australian Journal of Ecology 1995,20, 81-107,
Djalkmara Billabong plays a crucial role in providing recruits for
upstream  dry-season refuges, a key ecological process for fish
within this seasonally-flowing creek.'

'In fact, it seems that the timing of the current approval may
have been designed to avoid precisely the scrutiny that the Senate
inquiry and the environmental impact assessment procedures will
focus on it.'

ERA and the NTDME should not be allowed to get  away with this
sleight-of-hand. Orebody-3 should be delayed until the Senate
Select Committee on uranium mining has been allowed to assess it
in the light of the data revealed by the formal environmental
assessment for the Jabiluka proposal' Mr Hallam  concluded.

Friends of the Earth is currently helping to organise a national
day of action against uranium mining on 24th of May, as part of
the Stop Uranium Mining Coalition.   Anti-uranium actions are
scheduled around Australia on that day.

The Stop Uranium Mining Coalition includes Friends of the Earth,
the Wilderness Society, People for Nuclear Disarmament, The
Anti-Bases Coalition, Paddlers for Peace, Sydney Peace Squadron,
the Greens,  Pax Christi, The Australian Conservation Foundation,
The National Union of Students (NSW and National) Sydney
University SRC, the NSW Fire Fighters, the Maritime Workers Union,

STOP CHINESE NUCLEAR TESTING DEMONSTRATION MON 10/6/96.

The Stop Uranium mining group, a coalition consisting of Friends
of the Earth, The Wilderness Society, The greens, People for
Nuclear Disarmament, Resistance, the ISO, Pax Christi, The
National Union of Students, and a large number of other groups,
has condemned yesterdays Chinese test, and will be holding a
protest outside the Chinese Consulate at 539 Elizabeth St Surrey
Hills at 4pm today (Monday 10th.)

According to FOE Sydney Nuclear Campaigner John Hallam:  'The test
yesterday was expected for some time. Nonetheless, right up till
1pm yesterday, we had hoped the Chinese might come to their senses
and desist.  There were indications that the Chinese were being
more accommodating in the negotiations for a comprehensive
test-ban treaty, and not insisting on the right to conduct
so-called TpeacefulU nuclear explosions.  Yesterdays test brings
the Chinese testing total to 44 known tests, one more than the UK.
This means that the Chinese are finally up with what they
doubtless regard as the 'big boys' of the nuclear club, though
they are of course nowhere near the 1030 tests carried out by the
US, the 715 carried out by the  erstwhile USSR, or the 196 carried
out by France.

Nonetheless, China is now the only nation with an active testing
program, and as such this represents a  threat to the signing of a
true zero-threshold  CTBT planned for any time now.  Equally much
of a threat to the real intent of the treaty however, is the
extensive testing in cyberspace that will be done by the US on the
unprecedentedly large and fast 'Paragon' supercomputer at Los
Alamos, the French simulations to be done under the PALEN program,
and similar Russian programs. These virtual tests, in combination
with hydronuclear testing, allow the real intent of the CTBT - the
elimination of warhead development- to be evaded.

We call upon the Australian government to protest in the strongest
terms to the Chinese, but to let France and the US know also that
virtual and hydronuclear test programs done under the excuse of
'stockpile maintenance' are contrary to the spirit  of the CTBT.'

ATTN: ALEXANDER DOWNER
RE: CHINESE NUCLEAR TESTING
FROM: JOHN HALLAM.

Dear Mr Downer:  I am writing to you as organiser of the recent
demonstration against nuclear testing outside the Chinese
Consulate in Sydney.

As you are probably aware, a vigil and a demonstration against
nuclear testing and  the destruction of the Tibetan environment
took place on Tuesday 4/ Wednesday 5th June, and then again on
Monday 10/6 in response to the Chinese test at Lop Nor on Saturday
8/6.

The vigil on 4/5 June was organised by the Wilderness Society
(TWS) with the help of Friends of the Earth (FOE) and the Stop
Uranium Mining Coalition,(SUM). The one on Mon10th in response to
the actual test was organised by FOE and the SUM coalition with
the support of TWS.  Another demonstration in response to the same
test was held on Sunday 9/6 by Greenpeace.

In my statements to media on 10/6 outside the Consulate, I was for
once in a position to congratulate the government. It was
gratifying to see that  you summoned the Chinese ambassador
immediately and conveyed your displeasure.

I understand that you have told the Chinese government that:
testing in the light of world reaction to French nuclear testing
last year, and in the crucial leadup time before the conclusion of
a comprehensive test-ban treaty is insensitive in the extreme;
that a 45th Chinese test would be unacceptable; and that a strong,
zero- threshold CTBT, without provisions for so-called 'peaceful'
nuclear explosions (PNEs) is essential.

FOE and other antinuclear organisations certainly agree with this
perspective.  However, we would point out that while Chinese (and
French) testing is unacceptable, and while it is absolutely
necessary for a CTBT not to contain loopholes allowing PNEUs,
there are other ways in which nuclear warhead development can and
will continue even after the signature of a CTBT.

The possibility of substantial programs of 'hydronuclear' and
virtual testing taking place in the US and Russia and
sophisticated programs of virtual testing (as well as certain
aspects of the laser facility operating near Bordeaux in France
and similar facilities such as the projected NIF facility in the
US) enable warhead development and optimisation to take place. It
is noteworthy that an early Indonesian version of the CTBT text
prohibited testing in all environments including in cyberspace.
The Indonesian text failed I understand, due to opposition from
the weapons powers and because of concerns over the practicality
of enforcement.

Our concern in demonstrating outside the Chinese consulate in
Sydney on Monday was to make it clear to the Chinese government
that testing, any testing, by any country - France or China, or
for that matter the US or Russia - is absolutely unacceptable. It
is gratifying to see that your government was able to make this
clear to China.

I would like to suggest however, that you should express concern
also over US hydronuclear and virtual testing, and over similar
activities in France and Russia. In this matter, it is important
to note that when a group of 21 congresspeople wrote to President
Clinton asking him to strongly protest the Chinese test, they also
asked him to immediately cancel US hydronuclear tests planned at
the Nevada test site on June18th.

Clearly, differences will exist between us over the matter of
uranium mining and export. FOE strongly believes that any
participation in the nuclear fuel cycle contributes to the danger
of nuclear proliferation by increasing the quantity of fissionable
material in circulation, and increasing the chances of
weapons-significant quantities going astray.   We will continue to
oppose the mining of uranium, and seek to persuade you to do so
too.  However, it is pleasing to see that in this matter, we seem
to be moving in a similar direction.

The signing of a strong, zero-threshold CTBT without loopholes for
PNEs will be a significant step toward a nuclear - weapons - free
world, as would the cessation of hydronuclear and virtual testing.


I look forward to further cooperation in this matter, Yours
Sincerely, John Hallam.  Nuclear Campaigner, F.O.E. Sydney

ATTN: SENATOR HILL, SENATOR PARER.

FROM: JOHN HALLAM
RE: URANIUM INQUIRY, CEPA.

Dear Senators Hill and Parer:  I am writing to you in connection
with the calls by the ACF, Wilderness Society,ECNT, and FOE
Melbourne for a public inquiry into the environmental impact of
uranium mining in the Kakadu National Park under section 11 of the
1974 Environment Protection - Impact of Proposals legislation.  I
also wish to make clear our absolute horror at recent reports that
your government is contemplating the dismantling of the
Commonwealth EPA, currently headed by Mr Barry Carbon.

1)CEPA The dismantlement of the Commonwealth EPA, at a saving of a
relatively miserable $20million, would render impossible the
adequate assessment of environmental impact statements for not
only uranium projects, but other projects that come under
Commonwealth jurisdiction, or that require Commonwealth
expenditure or approvals.  Unless the Office of the Supervising
Scientist, currently part of the EPA, were to continue under the
jurisdiction of some other department or were to revert to its
previous independent existence, the functions of that body would
cease also - a disaster for environmental protection and
monitoring that would make nonsense of your governments statements
that uranium mining would proceed only under  the most stringent
possible environmental safeguards and monitoring. FOE has argued
for years that the Office of the Supervising Scientist should
become responsible via its current integration with CEPA, for all
uranium mining activities nationwide as well as for the creation
and enforcement of all national nuclear regulation. I expressed
this view only recently in Canberra to your office and to Senator
Parer.  The abolition of CEPA is a move in precisely the opposite
direction.

In addition, CEPA is the only Commonwealth body that can be
responsible for national and international nuclear standards and
codes in Australia under the TEnvironment Protection - Nuclear
CodesU legislation passed by the previous Coalition government.
These include the Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the
Mining and Milling of Radioactive ores, the Code of Practice and
Guidelines for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste by Shallow Land
Burial, and codes of practice for disposal of uranium tailings and
for the transport of radioactive materials.  These codes are based
in part on international standards to which Australia is a party.


CEPA provides an essential environmental safeguard, and should not
only be retained but expanded and improved. Your government has
stated that it sees the protection of the environment as a
priority. If this is truly so it must remain so whatever the
prospects for proceeds from the partial privatisation of Telstra.


2) URANIUM INQUIRY I note that you have already said in your
public statements that you do not wish for an inquiry that
canvasses the broader issues involved with uranium mining in
general, and that you believe that the Ranger inquiry of 1975-77
has already examined the issues involved.

However, I believe that a   strong case  exists for a public
inquiry, both into the broader issues raised by uranium mining,
and into the multiple site-specific environmental issues raised by
the possibility of new mines in Kakadu.

In meetings recently in Canberra with Senator Parer  and with your
own office, I emphasised that my own past experience of the last
20 years with environmental impact assessment procedure under the
1974 Act has been less than satisfactory.  Areas in which I
indicated there are problems include the treatment of the 'no
project' option, which is normally dismissed in a few contemptuous
lines, lack of adequate feasibility and economic analyses, and the
absence of a proper 'cost-benefit' approach in general, a lack
which is all the more surprising as the 1974 Act itself is clearly
framed in a manner that emphasises that the 'no project' option
must be taken seriously, and that the process itself is not merely
one of deciding what safeguards may be Tadded onU to a project for
which a go-ahead is already predetermined, but is one of
determining whether or not the project or projects under
consideration should proceed at all.  All too often, it seems to
me that the environmental impact assessment procedure has been
used as a kind of rubber-stamp to legitimatise decisions for a
project go- ahead that have been taken elsewhere. This should not
happen and is contrary to the spirit and intent of the 1974
legislation.

A public inquiry is certainly the best way to get around this
problem . A public inquiry would provide an independent assessment
of the environmental impact of multiple uranium mining projects in
the Kakadu area, without being totally dependent for its input on
company or company consultant-prepared EISUs. In addition, a
public inquiry will be able to provide an unbiased (or less
biased) assessment of the actual benefit of going ahead with any
of the proposed projects in the Kakadu area.This process would
best facilitate your stated goal of ensuring that the Kakadu
region receives the highest degree of environmental protection.  A
public inquiry will be able to deal with more than one project at
a time, so that the combined impact of Ranger, Jabiluka, and
Koongarra may be considered at once in an integrated manner,
whereas a simple EIS is unable to achieve this as each project is
considered separately.

You argue that the Ranger inquiry of 1975-77 has already covered
the relevant issues.  However, the Ranger inquiry took place
nearly 20 years ago, and while it was in some respects a model
environmental inquiry,  its conclusions for a Jabiluka or
Koongarra project today are certainly dated. It is worth noting
however, that the Ranger inquiry recommended (a) that the
Koongarra project should not proceed, and (b) that no more than
one uranium project should operate at any one time - a policy it
called 'sequential development', which was in effect a one-mine
policy. (c) That no central milling of uranium should occur. The
development of Jabiluka contravenes both those recommendations.

Since the time of the Ranger inquiry, some 15 years of operating
experience has been accumulated with uranium mining in Kakadu, and
a number of problems have arisen which were not anticipated by it.
These include problems with water management and long - terms
tailings storage which are documented in detail in successive
annual reports of the Office of the Supervising  Scientist (OSS),
created as one of the recommendations of the Ranger inquiry.

FOE has in addition expressed to Senator Parer and to your office
our observation that the current regulatory and monitoring
arrangements in the NT, in which the OSS monitors and sets
standards, while the NTDME has the power to enforce environmental
requirements are a recipe for administrative confusion.
Clarification of, and public confidence in, the monitoring and
regulatory mechanisms is particularly vital in this time  of new
mining proposals and a changing series of working arrangements
between the relevant agencies. The operation of these regulatory
arrangements would be a fit subject for consideration by a Kakadu
uranium environmental inquiry under Section11.

Finally, I note that calls have been made for the current Senate
inquiry on Low Level Radioactive Waste to continue through the
current Senate as an inquiry into uranium mining.  This is no
reason not to hold a Section11 inquiry.  There is a strong need
for an inquiry into the very principle of the expansion of uranium
mining in this country, especially in view of the fact that the
environmental community as a whole as well as much of the
Australian public would clearly rather see uranium mining cease
completely.  A Senate Inquiry, if it took place should in our
view, encompass the broadest considerations relating to uranium
mining. As such, it would fulfil a different function from a more
narrowly-focused inquiry under Section-11 of the 1974 Act.

Both a section-11 inquiry and a broader  Senate inquiry are in our
opinion, an absolute necessity in view of your governments plans,
and we call on you to reconsider your attitude in this matter.
Current proposals to abolish CEPA make the necessity for an
inquiry even more pressing.

the Earth Sydney.  cc Dr. Carmen Lawrence Senator Faulkner Senator

FROM: JOHN HALLAM, F.O.E. SYDNEY.
RE: JABILUKA URANIUM PROJECT SCOPING.

Dear Senators Hill and Parer:  I am writing to you to articulate
concerns FOE and others have over the environmental impact
assessment scoping process for the Jabiluka project. It is
essential that there be full public participation in the scoping
process, especially in the light of what appears to be firm
opposition by the traditional owners to any go-ahead for that
project, as well as concerns arising out of nearly 20 years
experience of commenting on uranium projects under EPIP
procedures.

1)Scoping Process Full public participation in the scoping
process, whereby the public gets to comment on what matters are in
fact covered by the environmental impact assessment process is
common, and is not incompatible with guidelines that are already
set out in the administrative procedures to the EPIP legislation.
For example, US EIA practice involves a scoping exercise in which
scoping hearings may be held, or in which scoping may take place
as a result of comments in response to a 'Notice of Intent' (NOI)
to prepare an EIS. Scoping is part of the formal EIA process in
W.A., where the public is also able to appeal to the Minister
against the level of assessment. The Commonwealth EPA has I
understand, proposed the introduction of public scoping into the
EPIP process. I also understand from conversations with your
(Senator Hills) staff, that there will in fact, be a public
scoping process, and urge that this be adhered to.

2)Concerns arising out of Comment Experience Thus far, I have
commented for FOE on the original Jabiluka project, on the
Koongarra project, on the Yeelirrie project, on the Beverley
project, the Honeymoon project, the Ben Lomond project, and the
Olympic Dam (Roxby Downs) project.  The experience has been a
dispiriting one, as it seems that the spirit and intent of the Act
and its administrative procedures have been steadily eroded. A
reading of the Administrative procedures of the Act would lead one
to expect detailed information on cost-benefit analysis of uranium
projects, a full analysis of the 'no action' alternative, and the
production of detailed feasibility studies. This information,
desirable whatever the legal niceties of the Act, has been notably
lacking in uranium EISUs.

This observation applies particularly to sections 2.2 of the
administrative procedures, section 3.1.2., and section 4.1 which
specify the information required by procedures,  the matters to be
taken into account by an EIS, and the contents of  environmental
impact statements. These are all matters that properly fall within
the province of scoping.

These sections of the Act, while they relate to three separate
levels of review - the consideration by the Minister for the need
for an EIS or PER,(2.2) the consideration by the Minister of the
level of assessment(3.1.2.) and the information to be contained in
an EIS(4.1 b,f,i) - clearly demonstrate that a major priority of
the Act is to evaluate not only secondary matters such as the
environmental safeguards to be applied to a project, but is above
all to evaluate whether indeed any given project should take place
at all. Yet evaluation of whether a given project should or should
not proceed, especially important in the case of controversial
projects such as uranium mines (or any other controversial
projects) has been notably absent from both draft and final EISUs
for uranium projects.

Indeed, If I were to present a 'wish list' in regard to scoping,
it would be simply that the existing administrative procedures be
adhered to both as to their spirit and letter.  This would be
particularly so with regard to the overall policy question as to
whether a project should in fact proceed - that is whether the
project under contemplation is or is not in the national
interest.

Both the EPIP Act and the administrative procedures are clearly
designed with this as the most important question to be dealt with
in any environmental assessment. Yet actual uranium project EIS's
do not reflect this emphasis at all, and rather seem to be
prepared on the assumption that a project go-ahead is inevitable,
and that the only matters open for discussion are say, the colour
of the site boundary fence, or at best the nature of the tailings
disposal method. In practice, it is likely to be assumed that this
too, is already decided.  The practice to date has been even in
these secondary matters, not so much to take public concerns into
account in actually planning the project so that the final EIS
represents a project plan that is in some sense the result of
public input - (which I take to be the intent of the EPIP Act )-
but rather to produce a final EIS which simply tells the benighted
and ignorant public that it has got everything wrong, in which
case one wonders what was the point of the exercise in the first
place.

Let us look in more detail at the matter of the overall benefit or
otherwise of the project.

According to Section 2.2(a) of the Administrative procedures, "For
the purposes of paragraph2.1, the information required by these
procedures shall, to the extent appropriate in the circumstances
of the case, be information- (a)summarising any preliminary
planning, consideration, or work undertaken in relation to the
proposed action and in particular, describing any feasible and
prudent alternative to the proposed action" While according to
section 4.1 of the administrative procedures, "To the extent
appropriate in the circumstances of the case, an environmental
impact statement shall- (a)State the objectives of the proposed
action (b)Analyse the need for the proposed action.  (c) Indicate
the consequences of not taking the proposed action
.....(f)examine any feasible and prudent alternative to the
proposed action.
....(i)outline the reasons for the choice of the proposed action."

 Other subsections of both 4.1 and 2.2 include information that
 would be absolutely necessary for achieving an overall
 cost/benefit analysis of the proposed action.

These sections of the administrative procedures have special
relevance to uranium projects, where the need for, and benefit of,
the project is hotly contested. They also have special relevance
where the traditional owners of the land on which the project
takes place have indicated their opposition to the project.

Yet in general, environmental impact statements have given most of
their consideration to matters such as the precise brand of
down-hole EM probe used for well-logging, rather than to any form
of cost-benefit analysis or national interest analysis of the
project as a whole.

Environmental impact statements, both draft and final, have tended
to deal with 4.1(b) (c) and (f), and 2.2(a) covering the need for
the proposed action, consequences of not taking it, and feasible
and prudent alternatives to it in a manner that is completely
unsatisfactory.

Thus, the original (1979) final EIS for the Jabiluka project, in
section 4.1 of the EIS, Talternatives consideredU notes different
mining procedures but pays no attention whatsoever to the
no-project alternative, though this was the most popular
alternative mentioned by commentators on the EIS - a deficiency
that was bought to the attention of the minister at the time by
FOE.  Similar tales could be told about every other uranium EIS.


While matters of environmental monitoring, mitigation, and
protection are crucial once a project go-ahead is given, the
question of whether it ought, all things considered, to be given
is or should be central to the process under EPIP, and it is clear
from the manner in which the administrative procedures are
formulated that this was so for the framers of this act.

3) Social Impacts Another matter which needs to be taken into
account under EPIP procedures as a matter of highest priority is
that of the social impact of uranium projects.  According to the
administrative procedures, 3.1.2.)(a) in determining the level of
assessment, the Minister must take into account of whether or not
the proposed action has "(i)a substantial environmental effect on
a community".  The Commonwealth EIA Review notes on p35 that:
"153. Impacts on people and their surroundings (particularly the
social and health aspects of environmental change) go beyond the
natural world to encompass human activity and quality of life.
These impacts may include changes in peoples lifestyles, their
cultural traditions and their community..."

The CEPA review goes on to say that environmental review should
nonetheless be limited to the interaction between the biophysical
and the social environments, a suggestion that seems to contradict
the original definition of 'environment' in the Act as 'all
aspects of the surroundings of Man, whether affecting him as an
individual or in his social groupings...' Be that as it may, FOE
thinks that social impact in its widest sense must be part of any
environmental review process.

This is particularly the case where Indigenous peoples and their
rights are concerned, and especially so  where development has
been foisted on local peoples whether they want it or not. In this
context, it is significant that the NLC has requested up-to-date
environmental and social impact statements be prepared by
independent processes acceptable to all parties.

Where, as in the case of the Jabiluka project, the traditional
owners of the land on which the project stands have made it clear
that they consent neither to the project as it is now envisaged
nor to the project envisaged in the 1982 agreement between
Pancontinental mining and the NLC, that lack of consent must be
taken into account.  In our view, it must be absolutely respected,
and  there must be no question of applying pressure on that
community, already subjected to more pressures than it should be,
to change its mind or to proceed under the 1982 agreement. You
have made it clear on a number of occasions that you will
absolutely respect the wishes of the Traditional Owners. If indeed
you wish to do so, then it is clear that the Jabiluka project
cannot proceed, and that the only result that can legitimately
come out of an honest EPIP process is an assessment that the
project should be terminated. 4.1(c) which requires that the EIS
'indicate the consequences of not taking the proposed action' of
the administrative procedures, is not only something that should
be examined in detail, but is indeed the only valid alternative,
given the expressed attitude of the Jabiluka Traditional Owners.

In Summary, we call on you:  (a)To ensure full public involvement
in the scoping procedure.  (b)To ensure that alternatives to the
proposed project including especially the no-project option are
taken seriously as the administrative procedures indicate that
they should be.  (c)Ensure that EPIP cover a full evaluation of
social impacts.  (d)Take the refusal of the Jabiluka TOUs as
decisive not only for the existing project alternative but for any
uranium mine whatsoever, and ensure absolutely that no pressure of
any kind is bought to bear on them to change their mind.

FRIENDS OF THE EARTH PRESS RELEASE 2/5/96 SENATE URANIUM INQUIRY
THE RIGHT MOVE SAYS F.O.E.

Green group Friends of the Earth today congratulated the Greens,
the Democrats, the Government and the Opposition on  decision to
hold a Senate inquiry into uranium mining, but emphasised that
this will in no way alter the opposition of FOE and the rest of
the green movement to uranium mining and participation in the
nuclear fuel cycle.

According to FOE uranium campaigner John Hallam, "The decision to
hold a full inquiry with broad terms of reference into all aspects
of uranium mining in Australia including the aspects of
proliferation and waste disposal as well as all aspects of uranium
mining within Australia itself is most welcome. F.O.E. has lobbied
the government and the opposition most strenuously in this matter
over the past weeks, and we indicated clearly to all parties that
we preferred the terms of reference suggested by the greens to the
much narrower Kakadu-oriented ones put forward by the ALP.  A
decision to increase the number of uranium mines in Australia,
especially a decision to rely on the free-market driven approach
advocated by the government has implications far beyond the Kakadu
region, important and precious as that region is, and disastrous
as more uranium mines in that region would be."

"There are potential uranium projects at Kintyre adjoining the
Rudall River National Park in W.A., at Yeelirrie in W.A., at
Honeymoon and Beverley in S.A.., and at Ben Lomond in Queensland,
and there are proposals for a major increase in the uranium output
of Roxby Downs which could have catastrophic implications for the
SA Mound Springs.  There is currently no national regulatory
framework for uranium mining, only a series of ad-hoc arrangements
which differ from state to state. All of these issues will need to
be addressed by the Senate Inquiry.  It will need to start by
focusing on the Jabiluka project in Kakadu as that is poised to
go, but then it must canvass these much broader issues as well as
site and project-specific issues."

"FOE expects that in the coming months, that we will have a
productive and hard-working relationship with the inquiry, and
that they will take seriously the proposition we have been arguing
for the last 20 years: That Australia should leave uranium in the
ground." Contact: John Hallam, (02)283-2004 M(015)202060

re:
URANIUM MINING
NUCLEAR TESTING

URANIUM MINING
On 24thMay'96, people around Australia demonstrated against the
plans of the conservative Howard government to open more uranium
mines.

In Sydney, at 5pm, between 500 and 800 people met outside Sydney
Town Hall, under the auspices of the Stop Uranium Mining
Coalition. (SUM) They were addressed by Senator Dee Margetts of
the W.A. Greens, and speakers from SUM, Trade Union, and Student
groups.  They then marched down from the town hall, down George
Street, to the headquarters of ERA (Energy Resources of
Australia), where they were addressed by Senator Bruce Childs of
the Labour Party, George Adjitjondro from Indonesia,  and John
Hallam from friends of the Earth.

Similar gatherings took place in Melbourne, where as many as 1500
people marched after being addressed by Democrat Senator Meg Lees,
in Brisbane, in Adelaide, in Perth, and in Darwin where a petition
was presented to the Minister for mines.  The demonstrations were
marginalised in print media reporting, but obtained fairly good
electronic media coverage - a common pattern in Australia.

Since then things have continued to be busy on the uranium and
nuclear front.

The Aboriginal Traditional Owners of the Jabiluka uranium deposit
dropped a bombshell on government plans to mine at Jabiluka by
getting the Northern Land Council to write to the Minister for the
Environment to the effect that they oppose the project. Senator
Robert Hill,  Minister for the Environment, had previously stated
that aboriginal approval would be essential for the project to
proceed.  According to the NLC letter:

"....The Land Council has met extensively over the last few weeks
with relevant Aboriginal people to discuss the Jabiluka project
generally and in particular, ERA's proposed changes to the
Jabiluka project . Those proposals are set out in a document of
four volumes entitled 'Jabiluka-2 Project Scope Outline' dated
March 1996, which has been provided by ERA to the NLC."

'The Aboriginal groups are not prepared to agree to any change to
the original proposal to mine upon which is based the 1982 mining
agreement under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory)
Act 1976 between Pancontinental Mining Limited, Getty Oil
Development Company Limited, and the Northern Land Council. The
Aboriginal groups are opposed to ERA's proposals for changes to
mining and milling at Jabiluka and in particular, the proposal to
mill Jabiluka ore at the existing Ranger mill. Indeed, they do not
want the Jabiluka mine to proceed at all."

"....I note that the original environmental impact statement for
the Jabiluka project was prepared in 1979.  The passage of
seventeen years clearly renders that statement inadequate as a
basis for making proper decisions, and request that you assist in
ensuring that an up-to-date environmental and social impact
statements are prepared before any mining is permitted to proceed.
Any such assessments will be materially flawed  in not
meaningless, if not undertaken independently and by processes
acceptable to all parties..."

There are number of important points here. The fact is that  a
proposal for a project, then to be undertaken by Pancontinental
Mining and Getty Oil, was approved in 1979, and an agreement
arrived at under some pressure, between the Northern Land Council
and Pancon in 1982.  The proposal agreed to was however, so
different from the proposal that Energy Resources of Australia
wants to pursue, that it is in effect a completely different
proposal.

The Traditional Owners of  Jabiluka, via the NLC, have let it be
known that they neither want to consider a new proposal, nor do
they want to consider renegotiating the old 1982 proposal.  This
means that the entire Jabiluka proposal has been effectively
thrown into a legal morass. (See appended letter to Senators Hill
and Parer from FOE on Jabiluka Project Scoping, where the wishes
of the Jabiluka T.O.'s are referred to, and the Orebody No3 Press
release)

In related developments, the Senate Select Committee on Uranium
mining and Milling has now held preliminary meetings and has
called for submissions, by July 5th.  Hearings will take place
later in the year, possibly in September/October.  Clearly, the
social impact of uranium mining, the consideration that has driven
the Jabiluka TO's to oppose any new uranium project, will be a
crucial consideration at the Senate inquiry, along with the
questions of local and regional environmental impact,  and
bilateral safeguards in the Senate inquiry's terms of reference.

NUCLEAR TESTING
The Nuclear testing issue was again placed on the Australian
agenda by the Chinese test of 8/6/96. Prior to the actual test, a
vigil had already taken place in front of the Chinese consulate on
World Environment Day, in the knowledge that a test could be
imminent, organised by the Wilderness Society's 'Endangered Tibet'
Campaign, Friends of the Earth, and Amnesty.

The test itself saw a response on Sunday 9/6 in front of the
Consulate by Greenpeace, and again on 10/6 (just in case they
didn't get the message) by the Stop uranium mining Coalition and
the Wilderness Society Endangered Tibet campaign and the
Australia-Tibet Council. The Chinese consulate in Sydney is
getting to be a popular spot for demonstrations!  (See enclosed
press release 'Stop Chinese Nuclear Testing' 10/6/96' and letter
re Chinese testing to Alexander Downer)

The Government responded to its credit, by carpeting the Chinese
ambassador almost immediately, and on Monday10/6, by making a
formal protest in Beijing.  A phonecall to the Foreign Minister
Alexander Downers advisers suggested that a consensus of sorts has
arisen as par as Chinese testing is concerned: Both the
conservative government, and the peace and environment movements
see the current program of testing on the eve f the signature of a
CTBT as entirely counterproductive, and have called on Beijing to
desist immediately and to sign a genuine zero-threshold CTBT
immediately without provision for PNE's. The Downer ministerial
office opined to me that a CTBT that provided for PNE's would not
be worth having.

The question is however, just what they will do about the planned
US hydronuclear testing program. If US senators can write to Mr
Clinton asking him to cancel that program so, it seems, should
Australia.

FRIENDS OF THE EARTH PRESS RELEASE 16/5/96

OREBODY-3 APPROVAL AT RANGER URANIUM MINE 'PREMATURE' SAYS F.O.E.

Friends of the Earth have called on the Federal and NT Governments
to put the approval and development of Orebody-3 at the Ranger
uranium mine on hold until the Senate Select Committee on uranium,
recently set up in the Senate as an initiative of the W.A. Greens,
and the environmental review process for the Jabiluka uranium
project are complete. It was announced yesterday by the Northern
Territory Minister of Mines and Energy Mike Read, that his
department has granted approval for Energy resources of Australia
to mine Orebody 3, within the existing Ranger project area.

 According to FOE uranium spokesperson John Hallam:  'Approval for
Orebody Three at this point by the NTDME is highly premature. We
are about to enter two parallel processes of environmental
assessment which will have to consider the cumulative impacts of
all uranium mining operations for the whole region, namely the
formal environmental impact assessment for the development of the
Jabiluka orebody,  under the procedures of the 'Environment
Protection-Impact of Proposals' Act, and the recently created
Senate Select Committee on Uranium Mining. The Senate Select
Committee will be looking at all aspects of the nuclear fuel
cycle, but will be concentrating especially on the impacts of
mining in the Kakadu National Park. As such, it will have to
consider the cumulative impacts of all uranium mining activities,
including not only the new Jabiluka project, but Orebody-3.'
'While it is true that Orebody-three was included in the original
environmental assessment done under the Ranger Inquiry of 1975-77,
the fact is that Orebody-3 does have some special problems,
notably that it is directly under Djalkmara billabong, and will
therefore have to be de-watered extensively. This will require the
removal of Djalkmara Billabong. According to an article by Dr.
K.A. Bishop in the Australian Journal of Ecology 1995,20, 81-107,
Djalkmara Billabong plays a crucial role in providing recruits for
upstream  dry-season refuges, a key ecological process for fish
within this seasonally-flowing creek.'

'In fact, it seems that the timing of the current approval may
have been designed to avoid precisely the scrutiny that the Senate
inquiry and the environmental impact assessment procedures will
focus on it.'

ERA and the NTDME should not be allowed to get  away with this
sleight-of-hand. Orebody-3 should be delayed until the Senate
Select Committee on uranium mining has been allowed to assess it
in the light of the data revealed by the formal environmental
assessment for the Jabiluka proposal' Mr Hallam  concluded.

Friends of the Earth is currently helping to organise a national
day of action against uranium mining on 24th of May, as part of
the Stop Uranium Mining Coalition.   Anti-uranium actions are
scheduled around Australia on that day.

The Stop Uranium Mining Coalition includes Friends of the Earth,
the Wilderness Society, People for Nuclear Disarmament, The
Anti-Bases Coalition, Paddlers for Peace, Sydney Peace Squadron,
the Greens,  Pax Christi, The Australian Conservation Foundation,
The National Union of Students (NSW and National) Sydney
University SRC, the NSW Fire Fighters, the Maritime Workers Union,

STOP CHINESE NUCLEAR TESTING DEMONSTRATION MON 10/6/96.

The Stop Uranium mining group, a coalition consisting of Friends
of the Earth, The Wilderness Society, The greens, People for
Nuclear Disarmament, Resistance, the ISO, Pax Christi, The
National Union of Students, and a large number of other groups,
has condemned yesterdays Chinese test, and will be holding a
protest outside the Chinese Consulate at 539 Elizabeth St Surrey
Hills at 4pm today (Monday 10th.)

According to FOE Sydney Nuclear Campaigner John Hallam:  'The test
yesterday was expected for some time. Nonetheless, right up till
1pm yesterday, we had hoped the Chinese might come to their senses
and desist.  There were indications that the Chinese were being
more accommodating in the negotiations for a comprehensive
test-ban treaty, and not insisting on the right to conduct
so-called TpeacefulU nuclear explosions.  Yesterdays test brings
the Chinese testing total to 44 known tests, one more than the UK.
This means that the Chinese are finally up with what they
doubtless regard as the 'big boys' of the nuclear club, though
they are of course nowhere near the 1030 tests carried out by the
US, the 715 carried out by the  erstwhile USSR, or the 196 carried
out by France.

Nonetheless, China is now the only nation with an active testing
program, and as such this represents a  threat to the signing of a
true zero-threshold  CTBT planned for any time now.  Equally much
of a threat to the real intent of the treaty however, is the
extensive testing in cyberspace that will be done by the US on the
unprecedentedly large and fast 'Paragon' supercomputer at Los
Alamos, the French simulations to be done under the PALEN program,
and similar Russian programs. These virtual tests, in combination
with hydronuclear testing, allow the real intent of the CTBT - the
elimination of warhead development- to be evaded.

We call upon the Australian government to protest in the strongest
terms to the Chinese, but to let France and the US know also that
virtual and hydronuclear test programs done under the excuse of
'stockpile maintenance' are contrary to the spirit  of the CTBT.'

ATTN: ALEXANDER DOWNER
RE: CHINESE NUCLEAR TESTING
FROM: JOHN HALLAM.

Dear Mr Downer:  I am writing to you as organiser of the recent
demonstration against nuclear testing outside the Chinese
Consulate in Sydney.

As you are probably aware, a vigil and a demonstration against
nuclear testing and  the destruction of the Tibetan environment
took place on Tuesday 4/ Wednesday 5th June, and then again on
Monday 10/6 in response to the Chinese test at Lop Nor on Saturday
8/6.

The vigil on 4/5 June was organised by the Wilderness Society
(TWS) with the help of Friends of the Earth (FOE) and the Stop
Uranium Mining Coalition,(SUM). The one on Mon10th in response to
the actual test was organised by FOE and the SUM coalition with
the support of TWS.  Another demonstration in response to the same
test was held on Sunday 9/6 by Greenpeace.

In my statements to media on 10/6 outside the Consulate, I was for
once in a position to congratulate the government. It was
gratifying to see that  you summoned the Chinese ambassador
immediately and conveyed your displeasure.

I understand that you have told the Chinese government that:
testing in the light of world reaction to French nuclear testing
last year, and in the crucial leadup time before the conclusion of
a comprehensive test-ban treaty is insensitive in the extreme;
that a 45th Chinese test would be unacceptable; and that a strong,
zero- threshold CTBT, without provisions for so-called 'peaceful'
nuclear explosions (PNEs) is essential.

FOE and other antinuclear organisations certainly agree with this
perspective.  However, we would point out that while Chinese (and
French) testing is unacceptable, and while it is absolutely
necessary for a CTBT not to contain loopholes allowing PNEUs,
there are other ways in which nuclear warhead development can and
will continue even after the signature of a CTBT.

The possibility of substantial programs of 'hydronuclear' and
virtual testing taking place in the US and Russia and
sophisticated programs of virtual testing (as well as certain
aspects of the laser facility operating near Bordeaux in France
and similar facilities such as the projected NIF facility in the
US) enable warhead development and optimisation to take place. It
is noteworthy that an early Indonesian version of the CTBT text
prohibited testing in all environments including in cyberspace.
The Indonesian text failed I understand, due to opposition from
the weapons powers and because of concerns over the practicality
of enforcement.

Our concern in demonstrating outside the Chinese consulate in
Sydney on Monday was to make it clear to the Chinese government
that testing, any testing, by any country - France or China, or
for that matter the US or Russia - is absolutely unacceptable. It
is gratifying to see that your government was able to make this
clear to China.

I would like to suggest however, that you should express concern
also over US hydronuclear and virtual testing, and over similar
activities in France and Russia. In this matter, it is important
to note that when a group of 21 congresspeople wrote to President
Clinton asking him to strongly protest the Chinese test, they also
asked him to immediately cancel US hydronuclear tests planned at
the Nevada test site on June18th.

Clearly, differences will exist between us over the matter of
uranium mining and export. FOE strongly believes that any
participation in the nuclear fuel cycle contributes to the danger
of nuclear proliferation by increasing the quantity of fissionable
material in circulation, and increasing the chances of
weapons-significant quantities going astray.   We will continue to
oppose the mining of uranium, and seek to persuade you to do so
too.  However, it is pleasing to see that in this matter, we seem
to be moving in a similar direction.

The signing of a strong, zero-threshold CTBT without loopholes for
PNEs will be a significant step toward a nuclear - weapons - free
world, as would the cessation of hydronuclear and virtual testing.


I look forward to further cooperation in this matter, Yours
Sincerely, John Hallam.  Nuclear Campaigner, F.O.E. Sydney

FROM: JOHN HALLAM
RE: URANIUM INQUIRY, CEPA.

Dear Senators Hill and Parer:  I am writing to you in connection
with the calls by the ACF, Wilderness Society,ECNT, and FOE
Melbourne for a public inquiry into the environmental impact of
uranium mining in the Kakadu National Park under section 11 of the
1974 Environment Protection - Impact of Proposals legislation.  I
also wish to make clear our absolute horror at recent reports that
your government is contemplating the dismantling of the
Commonwealth EPA, currently headed by Mr Barry Carbon.

1)CEPA The dismantlement of the Commonwealth EPA, at a saving of a
relatively miserable $20million, would render impossible the
adequate assessment of environmental impact statements for not
only uranium projects, but other projects that come under
Commonwealth jurisdiction, or that require Commonwealth
expenditure or approvals.  Unless the Office of the Supervising
Scientist, currently part of the EPA, were to continue under the
jurisdiction of some other department or were to revert to its
previous independent existence, the functions of that body would
cease also - a disaster for environmental protection and
monitoring that would make nonsense of your governments statements
that uranium mining would proceed only under  the most stringent
possible environmental safeguards and monitoring. FOE has argued
for years that the Office of the Supervising Scientist should
become responsible via its current integration with CEPA, for all
uranium mining activities nationwide as well as for the creation
and enforcement of all national nuclear regulation. I expressed
this view only recently in Canberra to your office and to Senator
Parer.  The abolition of CEPA is a move in precisely the opposite
direction.

In addition, CEPA is the only Commonwealth body that can be
responsible for national and international nuclear standards and
codes in Australia under the TEnvironment Protection - Nuclear
CodesU legislation passed by the previous Coalition government.
These include the Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the
Mining and Milling of Radioactive ores, the Code of Practice and
Guidelines for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste by Shallow Land
Burial, and codes of practice for disposal of uranium tailings and
for the transport of radioactive materials.  These codes are based
in part on international standards to which Australia is a party.


CEPA provides an essential environmental safeguard, and should not
only be retained but expanded and improved. Your government has
stated that it sees the protection of the environment as a
priority. If this is truly so it must remain so whatever the
prospects for proceeds from the partial privatisation of Telstra.


2) URANIUM INQUIRY I note that you have already said in your
public statements that you do not wish for an inquiry that
canvasses the broader issues involved with uranium mining in
general, and that you believe that the Ranger inquiry of 1975-77
has already examined the issues involved.

However, I believe that a   strong case  exists for a public
inquiry, both into the broader issues raised by uranium mining,
and into the multiple site-specific environmental issues raised by
the possibility of new mines in Kakadu.

In meetings recently in Canberra with Senator Parer  and with your
own office, I emphasised that my own past experience of the last
20 years with environmental impact assessment procedure under the
1974 Act has been less than satisfactory.  Areas in which I
indicated there are problems include the treatment of the 'no
project' option, which is normally dismissed in a few contemptuous
lines, lack of adequate feasibility and economic analyses, and the
absence of a proper 'cost-benefit' approach in general, a lack
which is all the more surprising as the 1974 Act itself is clearly
framed in a manner that emphasises that the 'no project' option
must be taken seriously, and that the process itself is not merely
one of deciding what safeguards may be Tadded onU to a project for
which a go-ahead is already predetermined, but is one of
determining whether or not the project or projects under
consideration should proceed at all.  All too often, it seems to
me that the environmental impact assessment procedure has been
used as a kind of rubber-stamp to legitimatise decisions for a
project go- ahead that have been taken elsewhere. This should not
happen and is contrary to the spirit and intent of the 1974
legislation.

A public inquiry is certainly the best way to get around this
problem . A public inquiry would provide an independent assessment
of the environmental impact of multiple uranium mining projects in
the Kakadu area, without being totally dependent for its input on
company or company consultant-prepared EISUs. In addition, a
public inquiry will be able to provide an unbiased (or less
biased) assessment of the actual benefit of going ahead with any
of the proposed projects in the Kakadu area.This process would
best facilitate your stated goal of ensuring that the Kakadu
region receives the highest degree of environmental protection.  A
public inquiry will be able to deal with more than one project at
a time, so that the combined impact of Ranger, Jabiluka, and
Koongarra may be considered at once in an integrated manner,
whereas a simple EIS is unable to achieve this as each project is
considered separately.

You argue that the Ranger inquiry of 1975-77 has already covered
the relevant issues.  However, the Ranger inquiry took place
nearly 20 years ago, and while it was in some respects a model
environmental inquiry,  its conclusions for a Jabiluka or
Koongarra project today are certainly dated. It is worth noting
however, that the Ranger inquiry recommended (a) that the
Koongarra project should not proceed, and (b) that no more than
one uranium project should operate at any one time - a policy it
called 'sequential development', which was in effect a one-mine
policy. (c) That no central milling of uranium should occur. The
development of Jabiluka contravenes both those recommendations.

Since the time of the Ranger inquiry, some 15 years of operating
experience has been accumulated with uranium mining in Kakadu, and
a number of problems have arisen which were not anticipated by it.
These include problems with water management and long - terms
tailings storage which are documented in detail in successive
annual reports of the Office of the Supervising  Scientist (OSS),
created as one of the recommendations of the Ranger inquiry.

FOE has in addition expressed to Senator Parer and to your office
our observation that the current regulatory and monitoring
arrangements in the NT, in which the OSS monitors and sets
standards, while the NTDME has the power to enforce environmental
requirements are a recipe for administrative confusion.
Clarification of, and public confidence in, the monitoring and
regulatory mechanisms is particularly vital in this time  of new
mining proposals and a changing series of working arrangements
between the relevant agencies. The operation of these regulatory
arrangements would be a fit subject for consideration by a Kakadu
uranium environmental inquiry under Section11.

Finally, I note that calls have been made for the current Senate
inquiry on Low Level Radioactive Waste to continue through the
current Senate as an inquiry into uranium mining.  This is no
reason not to hold a Section11 inquiry.  There is a strong need
for an inquiry into the very principle of the expansion of uranium
mining in this country, especially in view of the fact that the
environmental community as a whole as well as much of the
Australian public would clearly rather see uranium mining cease
completely.  A Senate Inquiry, if it took place should in our
view, encompass the broadest considerations relating to uranium
mining. As such, it would fulfil a different function from a more
narrowly-focused inquiry under Section-11 of the 1974 Act.

Both a section-11 inquiry and a broader  Senate inquiry are in our
opinion, an absolute necessity in view of your governments plans,
and we call on you to reconsider your attitude in this matter.
Current proposals to abolish CEPA make the necessity for an
inquiry even more pressing.

Yours Sincerely, John R. Hallam.  Uranium Campaigner, Friends of
the Earth Sydney.  cc Dr. Carmen Lawrence Senator Faulkner Senator

FROM: JOHN HALLAM, F.O.E. SYDNEY.
RE: JABILUKA URANIUM PROJECT SCOPING.

Dear Senators Hill and Parer:  I am writing to you to articulate
concerns FOE and others have over the environmental impact
assessment scoping process for the Jabiluka project. It is
essential that there be full public participation in the scoping
process, especially in the light of what appears to be firm
opposition by the traditional owners to any go-ahead for that
project, as well as concerns arising out of nearly 20 years
experience of commenting on uranium projects under EPIP
procedures.

1)Scoping Process Full public participation in the scoping
process, whereby the public gets to comment on what matters are in
fact covered by the environmental impact assessment process is
common, and is not incompatible with guidelines that are already
set out in the administrative procedures to the EPIP legislation.
For example, US EIA practice involves a scoping exercise in which
scoping hearings may be held, or in which scoping may take place
as a result of comments in response to a 'Notice of Intent' (NOI)
to prepare an EIS. Scoping is part of the formal EIA process in
W.A., where the public is also able to appeal to the Minister
against the level of assessment. The Commonwealth EPA has I
understand, proposed the introduction of public scoping into the
EPIP process. I also understand from conversations with your
(Senator Hills) staff, that there will in fact, be a public
scoping process, and urge that this be adhered to.

2)Concerns arising out of Comment Experience Thus far, I have
commented for FOE on the original Jabiluka project, on the
Koongarra project, on the Yeelirrie project, on the Beverley
project, the Honeymoon project, the Ben Lomond project, and the
Olympic Dam (Roxby Downs) project.  The experience has been a
dispiriting one, as it seems that the spirit and intent of the Act
and its administrative procedures have been steadily eroded. A
reading of the Administrative procedures of the Act would lead one
to expect detailed information on cost-benefit analysis of uranium
projects, a full analysis of the 'no action' alternative, and the
production of detailed feasibility studies. This information,
desirable whatever the legal niceties of the Act, has been notably
lacking in uranium EISUs.

This observation applies particularly to sections 2.2 of the
administrative procedures, section 3.1.2., and section 4.1 which
specify the information required by procedures,  the matters to be
taken into account by an EIS, and the contents of  environmental
impact statements. These are all matters that properly fall within
the province of scoping.

These sections of the Act, while they relate to three separate
levels of review - the consideration by the Minister for the need
for an EIS or PER,(2.2) the consideration by the Minister of the
level of assessment(3.1.2.) and the information to be contained in
an EIS(4.1 b,f,i) - clearly demonstrate that a major priority of
the Act is to evaluate not only secondary matters such as the
environmental safeguards to be applied to a project, but is above
all to evaluate whether indeed any given project should take place
at all. Yet evaluation of whether a given project should or should
not proceed, especially important in the case of controversial
projects such as uranium mines (or any other controversial
projects) has been notably absent from both draft and final EISUs
for uranium projects.

Indeed, If I were to present a 'wish list' in regard to scoping,
it would be simply that the existing administrative procedures be
adhered to both as to their spirit and letter.  This would be
particularly so with regard to the overall policy question as to
whether a project should in fact proceed - that is whether the
project under contemplation is or is not in the national
interest.

Both the EPIP Act and the administrative procedures are clearly
designed with this as the most important question to be dealt with
in any environmental assessment. Yet actual uranium project EIS's
do not reflect this emphasis at all, and rather seem to be
prepared on the assumption that a project go-ahead is inevitable,
and that the only matters open for discussion are say, the colour
of the site boundary fence, or at best the nature of the tailings
disposal method. In practice, it is likely to be assumed that this
too, is already decided.  The practice to date has been even in
these secondary matters, not so much to take public concerns into
account in actually planning the project so that the final EIS
represents a project plan that is in some sense the result of
public input - (which I take to be the intent of the EPIP Act )-
but rather to produce a final EIS which simply tells the benighted
and ignorant public that it has got everything wrong, in which
case one wonders what was the point of the exercise in the first
place.

Let us look in more detail at the matter of the overall benefit or
otherwise of the project.

According to Section 2.2(a) of the Administrative procedures, "For
the purposes of paragraph2.1, the information required by these
procedures shall, to the extent appropriate in the circumstances
of the case, be information- (a)summarising any preliminary
planning, consideration, or work undertaken in relation to the
proposed action and in particular, describing any feasible and
prudent alternative to the proposed action" While according to
section 4.1 of the administrative procedures, "To the extent
appropriate in the circumstances of the case, an environmental
impact statement shall- (a)State the objectives of the proposed
action (b)Analyse the need for the proposed action.  (c) Indicate
the consequences of not taking the proposed action
.....(f)examine any feasible and prudent alternative to the
proposed action.
....(i)outline the reasons for the choice of the proposed action."

 Other subsections of both 4.1 and 2.2 include information that
 would be absolutely necessary for achieving an overall
 cost/benefit analysis of the proposed action.

These sections of the administrative procedures have special
relevance to uranium projects, where the need for, and benefit of,
the project is hotly contested. They also have special relevance
where the traditional owners of the land on which the project
takes place have indicated their opposition to the project.

Yet in general, environmental impact statements have given most of
their consideration to matters such as the precise brand of
down-hole EM probe used for well-logging, rather than to any form
of cost-benefit analysis or national interest analysis of the
project as a whole.

Environmental impact statements, both draft and final, have tended
to deal with 4.1(b) (c) and (f), and 2.2(a) covering the need for
the proposed action, consequences of not taking it, and feasible
and prudent alternatives to it in a manner that is completely
unsatisfactory.

Thus, the original (1979) final EIS for the Jabiluka project, in
section 4.1 of the EIS, Talternatives consideredU notes different
mining procedures but pays no attention whatsoever to the
no-project alternative, though this was the most popular
alternative mentioned by commentators on the EIS - a deficiency
that was bought to the attention of the minister at the time by
FOE.  Similar tales could be told about every other uranium EIS.


While matters of environmental monitoring, mitigation, and
protection are crucial once a project go-ahead is given, the
question of whether it ought, all things considered, to be given
is or should be central to the process under EPIP, and it is clear
from the manner in which the administrative procedures are
formulated that this was so for the framers of this act.

3) Social Impacts Another matter which needs to be taken into
account under EPIP procedures as a matter of highest priority is
that of the social impact of uranium projects.  According to the
administrative procedures, 3.1.2.)(a) in determining the level of
assessment, the Minister must take into account of whether or not
the proposed action has "(i)a substantial environmental effect on
a community".  The Commonwealth EIA Review notes on p35 that:
"153. Impacts on people and their surroundings (particularly the
social and health aspects of environmental change) go beyond the
natural world to encompass human activity and quality of life.
These impacts may include changes in peoples lifestyles, their
cultural traditions and their community..."

The CEPA review goes on to say that environmental review should
nonetheless be limited to the interaction between the biophysical
and the social environments, a suggestion that seems to contradict
the original definition of 'environment' in the Act as 'all
aspects of the surroundings of Man, whether affecting him as an
individual or in his social groupings...' Be that as it may, FOE
thinks that social impact in its widest sense must be part of any
environmental review process.

This is particularly the case where Indigenous peoples and their
rights are concerned, and especially so  where development has
been foisted on local peoples whether they want it or not. In this
context, it is significant that the NLC has requested up-to-date
environmental and social impact statements be prepared by
independent processes acceptable to all parties.

Where, as in the case of the Jabiluka project, the traditional
owners of the land on which the project stands have made it clear
that they consent neither to the project as it is now envisaged
nor to the project envisaged in the 1982 agreement between
Pancontinental mining and the NLC, that lack of consent must be
taken into account.  In our view, it must be absolutely respected,
and  there must be no question of applying pressure on that
community, already subjected to more pressures than it should be,
to change its mind or to proceed under the 1982 agreement. You
have made it clear on a number of occasions that you will
absolutely respect the wishes of the Traditional Owners. If indeed
you wish to do so, then it is clear that the Jabiluka project
cannot proceed, and that the only result that can legitimately
come out of an honest EPIP process is an assessment that the
project should be terminated. 4.1(c) which requires that the EIS
'indicate the consequences of not taking the proposed action' of
the administrative procedures, is not only something that should
be examined in detail, but is indeed the only valid alternative,
given the expressed attitude of the Jabiluka Traditional Owners.

In Summary, we call on you:  (a)To ensure full public involvement
in the scoping procedure.  (b)To ensure that alternatives to the
proposed project including especially the no-project option are
taken seriously as the administrative procedures indicate that
they should be.  (c)Ensure that EPIP cover a full evaluation of
social impacts.  (d)Take the refusal of the Jabiluka TOUs as
decisive not only for the existing project alternative but for any
uranium mine whatsoever, and ensure absolutely that no pressure of
any kind is bought to bear on them to change their mind.

FRIENDS OF THE EARTH PRESS RELEASE 2/5/96 SENATE URANIUM INQUIRY
THE RIGHT MOVE SAYS F.O.E.

Green group Friends of the Earth today congratulated the Greens,
the Democrats, the Government and the Opposition on  decision to
hold a Senate inquiry into uranium mining, but emphasised that
this will in no way alter the opposition of FOE and the rest of
the green movement to uranium mining and participation in the
nuclear fuel cycle.

According to FOE uranium campaigner John Hallam, "The decision to
hold a full inquiry with broad terms of reference into all aspects
of uranium mining in Australia including the aspects of
proliferation and waste disposal as well as all aspects of uranium
mining within Australia itself is most welcome. F.O.E. has lobbied
the government and the opposition most strenuously in this matter
over the past weeks, and we indicated clearly to all parties that
we preferred the terms of reference suggested by the greens to the
much narrower Kakadu-oriented ones put forward by the ALP.  A
decision to increase the number of uranium mines in Australia,
especially a decision to rely on the free-market driven approach
advocated by the government has implications far beyond the Kakadu
region, important and precious as that region is, and disastrous
as more uranium mines in that region would be."

"There are potential uranium projects at Kintyre adjoining the
Rudall River National Park in W.A., at Yeelirrie in W.A., at
Honeymoon and Beverley in S.A.., and at Ben Lomond in Queensland,
and there are proposals for a major increase in the uranium output
of Roxby Downs which could have catastrophic implications for the
SA Mound Springs.  There is currently no national regulatory
framework for uranium mining, only a series of ad-hoc arrangements
which differ from state to state. All of these issues will need to
be addressed by the Senate Inquiry.  It will need to start by
focusing on the Jabiluka project in Kakadu as that is poised to
go, but then it must canvass these much broader issues as well as
site and project-specific issues."

"FOE expects that in the coming months, that we will have a
productive and hard-working relationship with the inquiry, and
that they will take seriously the proposition we have been arguing
for the last 20 years: That Australia should leave uranium in the
ground." Contact: John Hallam, (02)283-2004 M(015)202060

         World's First "Nuclear Laundry" Washes Whiter

A company in the Netherlands has come up with the answer to those nuclear
"washday blues" by starting up the world's first commercial laundry for
industrial clothing, worn by workers at nuclear facilities, which might be
slightly contaminated by radioactivity.

If clothes start radiating more than just good style, the firm with the
solution is Euro Nuclear Services, which has just announced the opening of
its unique facility at Coevorden in north-east Holland, close to the border
with Germany. The laundry, covering an area of 2500 square metres,
eliminates the need for the operators of nuclear facilities to maintain
their own dedicated equipment and personnel for washing
slightly-contaminated clothing, and the company says the large-scale of the
specialist operation makes it economical.

Soiled material is sent in special containers to the laundry where it is
screened for radioactive contamination. Depending on the results, the
laundry is separated into two process lines. It either goes to one for
slightly-contaminated clothing, such as overalls, or to another for
non-contaminated goods, such as underwear and towels.

The washing is done with the use of specially-developed formulas, and
humidity-controlled dryers are also part of the process. State-of-the-art
detectors are used to check for residual radioactivity, before the
freshly-laundered goods are folded and repackaged, ready for return to the
customer - and another shift at the nuclear plant.

In addition to the laundering process, the company offers a complete
leasing programme, saving customers the expense of purchasing, storing and
stock-taking special clothing supplies which are sometimes only needed for
short periods.

The _summary_ of the Environmental Assessment Panel report on the Elliot  
Lake (Ontario) uranium mill tailings area management is now available at:

  <a href=http://www.ceaa.gc.ca/english/panels/ellsum/ellsum.html>http://www.ceaa.gc.ca/english/panels/ellsum/ellsum.html</a>


The panel supports the water cover concept proposed by the proponents and  
attacked by environmentalists (excerpts from summary):

"To establish an effective containment system for the wastes, the panel  
concludes that the tailings must be permanently contained in such a way as  
to insulate them from concurrent exposure to air and water, and to prevent  
their dispersion into the environment.  In the Elliot Lake environment,  
the best way to do this is to keep the reactive tailings permanently water  
saturated."

"The panel recommends that the proponents' proposals, designed to achieve  
such permanent saturation, should form the basis for developing the  
details of a decommissioning licence. However, the panel also recommends  
that there be a number of conditions that should be incorporated into the  
licensing process."

***************************************************

ACTION ALERT * ACTION ALERT

Immediate Ward Valley Action Needed

Alaskan Senator Frank Murkowski attempted to force land transfer legislation
that would immediately open the radioactive waste dump at Ward Valley
Wednesday night.  Senators Boxer and Feinstein were able to work with
Majority Leader Trent Lott to remove the legislation from the Department of
Defense authorization bill.  Murkowski vowed to strike again.  He will most
likely make a move in the next month before summer recess in August.  Senator
Feinstein is pivotal.  We need your help to shore up support with Senator
Feinstein to defeat S1596 and any legislation that authorizes a land transfer
to the state.

THE GOAL:  Place 50 calls, write/fax 50 letters, e-mail 50 messages to every
           Feinstein office with the following message:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Senator Feinstein;

	Thank you for working with Senator Boxer to remove S1596 (Murkowski) from
the Department of Defense bill that would transfer land at Ward Valley,
California for purposes of a radioactive waste dump.  We are now counting on
you to stand shoulder to shoulder with Senator Boxer to defeat S1596.  Your
efforts are essential to protecting our health and safety.  We urge you to
oppose any land transfer to the State for purposes of a radioactive waste
dump.  S1596 is a dangerous bill that would exempt environmental laws,
circumvent the Administration's Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement
(SEIS) process currently underway and prevent the scientific testing
necessary to answer outstanding safety questions.  Additionally, S1596 is a
scandalous attempt by an Alaskan Senator to resurrect the nearly bankrupt
company licensed to construct Ward Valley.  Please work with your Democratic
colleagues to defeat S1596 and any legislation with S1596 as an amendment,
and support the Administration's position of conducting the SEIS process and
additional scientific testing at Ward Valley.  We are counting on you.

IGNALINA POWER PLANT,  LITHUANIA --  A  NUCLEAR  FUEL  STORAGE
FACILITY  IS  PLANNED  at the Ignalina power plant and will be
financed by Ontario Hydro Company together with  tenders  from
Canadian AECL and German GNB companies.  Spent nuclear fuel in
Ignalina is stored today  in  underwater  reservoirs  situated
under  the  plant reactors.  The reservoirs will soon be full.
The Ontario Hydro director for Eastern  Europe,  John  Kieran,
said  his  company  already  worked with Ignalina power plant,
including the implementation of a program related  to  quality
management at the station.

ST PETERSBURG  --  ALEXANDER  NIKITIN  WILL  BE  JUDGED  BY  A
MILITARY  COURT  and  not by a civilian court,  according to a
recent decision by a city court.  Mr Nikitin has been  accused
of  revealing  state  military  secrets  in  his  work  on  an
environmental report  on  the  damage caused by (nuclear waste
of) the Northern Fleet.  His lawyer  has  issued  an  official
protest against  the  decision  for  him  to  be  judged  by a
non-civilian court.  Mr Nikitin was working for the  Norwegian
independent environmental  association  Bellona  when  he  was
arrested at the beginning of the year.

LUKASHENKO CALLS FOR NUCLEAR-FREE ZONE, MINSK, - The president
of Belarus on  Wednesday  said  the  nations  of  central  and
eastern Europe should be kept free of nuclear weapons.
Belarus inherited part of Moscow's nuclear arsenal after  1991
Soviet collapse,  along mwith Russia,  Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
Belarus promised to disarm by the end of 1996.
"I propose  that  the  former  socialist  countries of eastern
Europe, Belarus,  Ukraine and the Baltic countries should  set
up a nuclear free zone," President Alexander Lukashenko said.
But he  added  that  "a   unilateral   step   toward   nuclear
disarmament is  not enough" and expressed concern about NATO's
eastward expansion.

BALTIC SEA STATES ADOPT COOPERATION PROGRAMME,  KALMAR,  - The
foreign ministers  of  the  Baltic  Sea  states  on  Wednesday
adopted an action programme to boost regional  cooperation  in
crime-fighting, the   economy,  the  environment  and  nuclear
safety.
The 11 foreign ministers,  representing nine states around the
Baltic Sea plus Norway and Iceland,  hammered out the  details
of the  17-page  document  on  Tuesday  evening  and Wednesday
morning.
Several investments in the region are planned,  including road
and railway maintenance and harbour developments, totalling 40
billion kronor ($6,01 billion) for the 1995-1999 repiod.
Estonia, Latvia,  Lithuania,  Poland and Russia  will  receive
assistance in  cleaning up the environment,  particularly with
regard to treating toxic waste.

NEW PATENT LAW ADOPTED BY BRAZIL

Brazil, the world's sixth largest market for pharmaceuticals, 
adopted a new patent law in May that extends intellectual 
property protection to foods and pharmaceuticals. The United 
States lobbied intensively for stronger intellectual property 
rights in Brazil. "Brazil has done the right thing...We see 
it as a model for the rest of Latin America and the world," 
said a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research 
Manufacturers of America. Supporters of the law contend that 
the law should stimulate outside investment, while critics 
contend that in the short run it will drive commercial 
research offshore or into the hands of multinational 
companies because of the lack of local capacity. Sara Kanter, 
technical director of the Association of the National 
Pharmaceutical Laboratories in Brazil said, "Our industry is 
still in the copy-and-innovative phase, and our market share 
does not allow us to have capital enough to invest in 
research...90% of the Brazilian academic research [in the 
field] is being absorbed by multinational companies."

APPLICATIONS CREATE BACKLOG AT U.S. PATENT OFFICE

The immense amount of genetic data churned out by automated 
DNA sequencers has created a flood of patent applications to 
the U.S. Patent and Trademarks Office (PTO). According to PTO 
official John Doll, it could take a single senior staffer 
more than 90 years to examine the DNA sequences that 
havealready been submitted for patents. The PTO held public 
briefings to outline the scope of the problem, and public 
hearings to elicit ideas on how to streamline a painstaking 
and time-consuming process. It takes 60 to 65 hours to 
examine a batch of 100 sequences, at a cost of about $5,000. 
The sequences now awaiting review will cost more than $20 
million to process, yet fees may come to only $100,000.

For example, to maximize the $1,000 filing fee, companies 
that specialize in high volume DNA sequencing put clusters of 
sequences into a single application. Incyte Pharmaceuticals 
of California and Human Genome Sciences of Maryland have been 
channeling data from their mechanized processes into the PTO 
at a torrential rate. Incyte puts as many as 5000 DNA 
sequences into a single application. Randy Scott, Incyte's 
chief scientific officer, estimates the company has filed 
"over 400,000" sequences.

SCIENCE, Vol. 272, May 3, 1996.

PATENT OF BREAST CANCER GENE OPPOSED

A coalition of hundreds of women's and cancer advocacy groups 
is forming to oppose Myriad Genetics' application for a 
patent on a gene, BRCA1, which is linked to breast cancer. 
Nancy Evans, a vice president of Breast Cancer Action, a 
member of the newly formed coalition, said, "We want to 
promote as much research as possible...if someone patents 
this gene, they'll control the research. And they may not 
always want to encourage competition for products they're 
developing. That's not in the public interest, and it worries 
us." Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotech Industry 
Organization said, "If people think new drugs and new cures 
come out of basic research funded by the Government, that's a 
misperception...they don't, they won't. All the important new 
gene therapies are based on genes that had patent protection. 
Without that protection, investors won't put up the millions 
of dollars for research." According to Wendy McGoodwin, 
executive director of Council for Responsible Genetics, the 
research was not entirely dependent on investors; the 
government has paid for much of the basic genetic research 
and is committed to continuing it. She said, "It seems unfair 
that a private company using the benefit of that research 
would patent it, then turn around and charge us more."

YORK TIMES, May 21, 1996.

INDIAN TRIBE AWARDED ROYALTIES

The intellectual property rights to the active ingredient of 
a plant long known to combat stress has been awarded to the 
Kani, an indigenous tribe in the southern Indian state of 
Kerala. Tropical Botanical Garden and Research Institute 
(TBGRI), a government-owned research facility developed a 
drug, jeevani, which is based on the active ingredient, and 
sold the "know-how" to Arya Vaidhya Pharmacy. The Kani tribe 
will receive half of the know-how fee and a share of a two 
percent royalty on future drug sales. Ralupu Pushpangadan, 
director of TBGRI,  said, "The world did not know about this 
unique plant until the Kani people led us to it." He 
commented, "Our jeevani acts like Chinese ginseng...but it is 
superior, because it does not contain any steroid." Before 
deciding to market the drug, extensive trials were carried 
out on Indian athletes.

GENETICALLY MODIFIED MAIZE SEED REJECTED BY EU

A European Union regulatory body denied approval of Ciba-
Geigy's maize seed genetically engineered to be pesticide 
resistant for use in the European agriculture industry for 
two reasons. It was considered not to be sufficiently labeled 
and a gene engineered into the seed would have poisoned 
insect larvae. Some member states of the EU fear that the 
gene could be transferred into the wild once the maize seed 
sprouted. 

The rejection by the regulatory committee will be passed onto 
the Council of Ministers who can choose to accept the 
rejection or favor approval, in which case it would be sent 
back to the regulatory body for input from the executive 
body. The regulatory body consists of representatives from 
member states and was set up under the EU's Directive 
90/220 on Deliberate Release of Genetically Modified 
Organisms into the Environment.

Maize Seed," INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTER, May 1,

COCOA TREE GENETICS RESEARCHED

Researchers at Reading University are using genetic-
fingerprinting technologies on all types of cocoa trees, with 
funding provided by a grant from Cocoa Research, UK. The 
technology used to track down criminals is being used for the 
fingerprinting of the cocoa trees. The project will first 
catalogue the varieties of cocoa trees in greenhouses in UK, 
and then import leaves from cocoa trees around the world. By 
the end of the year, it plans to produce a report with 
genetic details of each variety. Mr. Eric Beauchamp, 
secretary of Cocoa Research said, "In the long term we want 
to transform and alter the way the trees produce cocoa to 
make them more efficient and resistant to diseases and 
pests."

FINANCIAL TIMES, May 10, 1996.

SHELLFISH IMMUNIZATION FOCUS OF RESEARCH 

Oysters, clams and mussels have been genetically engineered 
with a retrovirus that would immunize the shellfish from such 
viruses as hepatitis A, which can be passed on to humans. 
Thomas Chen of the University of Connecticut and Jane Burns 
of the University of California, San Diego, have completed 
experiments in which they altered the protein coating of a 
retrovirus, loaded it with a test gene, and injected it into 
the surf clams. The gene was passed on to the offspring, 
becoming a permanent part of their genetic code.

 EXPORT-IMPORT BANK SAYS NO TO WORLD'S M0ST DESTRUCTIVE DAM
           OTHER EXPORT CREDIT AGENCIES URGED TO DO SAME

After nearly two years of review, the US Export-Import Bank today denied
support to US corporations chasing contracts on China's Three Gorges Dam.
Caterpillar and Rotec Industries of Illinois and Voith Hydro of
Pennsylvania were hoping for letters of intent for loan guarantees from
Ex-Im which would enable them to submit formal bids to sell China
construction equipment for the dam.

Ex-Im Bank's President Martin A. Kamarck issued a statement today stating
that the Bank's board "has concluded that Ex-Im Bank cannot issue a letter
of interest for this project at this time. The information received [from
China] though voluminous, fails to establish the project's consistency with
the Bank's environmental guidelines."

"This is phenomenal," says International Rivers Network Executive Director
Owen Lammers. "It represents a serious blow against what would become the
world's most socially and environmentally ruinous dam."

According to Kamarck, "the major (though not only) issues of concern" for
Ex-Im were reservoir water quality, the endangered species and other
"ecological resources" threatened by the project, the "environmental and
socioeconomic impacts associated with the proposed resettlement of 1.3
million people", and the "protection of cultural resources".

The Chinese government has had numerous problems finding foreign financing
for the dam, estimated to cost up to $75 billion. The World Bank, the
leading international funder of large dams, has for some time stated that
it will not help fund the project. An international bond offering first
scheduled for release in April 1994 has been delayed indefinitely due to
concerns within the investment community over the financial risks inherent
to the dam.

China wants foreign equipment suppliers to arrange cheap loans to pay for
their equipment from their national export credit agencies (ECAs). With the
US declining interest, international attention will now focus on the ECAs
of Canada, Japan, Germany and Switzerland which are also considering
providing credits.

Owen Lammers says: "We hope that these other countries reach the same
conclusions as the US. Without international financial and technical
support it will be very hard for the Chinese government to complete the
dam. Opponents of the dam within China will stand a far greater chance of
stopping it."

In September 1995, following a year-long review of the project, the
National Security Council recommended that Ex-Im deny support for the
project. In December 1993, the US Bureau of Reclamation cancelled its
contract with the Chinese government to provide technical assistance for
the Three Gorges Dam.

If completed, the Three Gorges Dam would stretch nearly a mile across and
tower 575 feet above the bed of the Yangtze. Its reservoir would stretch
over 350 miles upstream and force the displacement of 1.3 million people.
It would be the most powerful hydroelectric dam in the world. Construction
began in 1994 and is scheduled to take 20 years.

In March 1991, opposition to the project in China forced the suspension of
the dam, but the project was swiftly resurrected by Premier Li Peng in the
aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre.

NARMADA INTERNATIONAL UPDATE
3 June, 1996

1. Narmada Satyagraha - Monsoon 1996

The Monsoon Satyagraha has been the focus of our fight every year. This
year, however, the monsoon will be different. Due to the people's struggle,
construction on the dam has been at a standstill for the last
one-and-a-half years. The Supreme Court of India too has taken significant
cognizance of the issues raised by the people and has stayed the work on
the central portion of the dam till at least 16 July, 1996, when the case
resumes for hearing. Given this, the Andolan has decided that the
satyagraha this year will be of a different nature.

Now the people of the valley want to assert their right to live in the
valley - and this satyagraha will be an expression of this right. This will
be done by the launching of many different programs of construction and
development (nav nirman) in the Valley. It will be a celebration of living
in the valley. Tree planting on a massive scale, housing, bio-gas, soil
water conservation, small irrigation schemes, libraries, schools (four new
ones have already started) and so on. This is the people's way of saying,
asserting that they are determined to stay in the Valley, and will work to
make this stay better, prosperous and bountiful.

Moreover, on one hand, the people have stopped further destruction by
stopping construction. But for those who have fought, and have seen their
houses, farms, property all submerged by the partly built dam,
rehabilitation is still a distant dream. Many of those who have faced the
submergence have of course declared from the beginning that they will not
move, that they will not leave the valley. And they are still there. There
were others, especially from the villages of Gujarat, who had taken the
Government for its word and had agreed to shift, some as early as 12-14
years back. Their state today is terrible. Many have abandoned their
"resettlement" sites and have gone back to their original village. Many
more are on the verge of doing so.

All these people and the Andolan are now demanding that until the
Government can ensure the proper rehabilitation of all those already
affected, it should not impound any water in the dam. Thus, the other major
demand of the satyagraha this year is the call to the Government to reopen
the sluices of the dam at 18 m, and to keep those at 53 m open.

The people are aware that it is as yet a fragile victory. The people are
aware that strong forces are reigned against them and these forces of the
vested interests could succeed in getting the construction work to start
again. The people, the valley, are prepared for such an eventuality, and if
this happens, the Andolan is perpetually ready to launch the do or die
struggle. This satyagraha will thus be also a means to monitor the
situation, to let the Government know that the people - not only of the
valley but of the whole Country - are watching their every move, and are
prepared to launch the highest struggle against this symbol of destructive
development.

The satyagraha will be launched from 21 June 1996, in the whole valley, but
with the centres at Jalsindhi (Jhabua District, Madhya Pradesh) and
Domkhedi (Dhule District, Maharashtra).

2. Harivallabh Parikh, head of the Anand Kiketan Ashram - one of the two
main pro-dam, pro-Government NGO's in Gujarat engaged in the rehabilitation
of the oustees who were vehemently trying to oppose the NBA - has been
charged with the rape of a 20 year-old tribal girl who was taking sewing
classes in his Ashram (Institute). While the police are searching for the
72 year-old "social worker," he is absconding. Many organisations,
including women's organisations, have called for his immediate arrest. It
is suspected that he may be getting political protection due to connections
in high places. While the rape case has been making headlines in Gujarat
for the last 10 days, it is a public secret that there have been many such
"going ons" in the Ashram for many years. But the Ashram has been very
powerful and it has been difficult for people to raise the issue.

3. Regarding the proposed Asian Development Bank loan for the State of
Gujarat, details are now available. The ADB is planning a massive
structural adjustment program (SAP) at the State level in Gujarat. The ADB
states that the Gujarat loan is being given to assist this, and the amount
will be determined by the adjustment costs of restructuring. However, the
money will go straight to the State budget to cover "revenue shortfalls due
to the SAP." Thus, it still leaves open the possibility that the money
could be used for SSP, as the funds would be fungible. NBA has requested
the ADB to give us the calculations that will determine this "cost of
adjustment" which will be used to determine the loan amount. NBA has also
asked that it be kept informed. ADB has refused to make any commitment on
the former. The loan amount is tentatively put at 250 million US$ in first
phase to be followed by loans of further 500 to 750 million US$. It is
likely to go to the Board by the year end. We must continue to monitor.

4. It may be recollected that the Supreme Court had asked the party states
to resolve their differences in three months and has fixed the date of
hearing for 16 July. Information available to us indicates that the states
have not been able to do so as yet. Much will depend upon the new
Government at the Center. Last month, after the Parliament elections, the
right wing party BJP was invited to form the Government, but this lasted
only 15 days as it could not get the required majority. A new coalition
Government has now taken charge headed by Deve Gowda of the Janata Dal, a
centrist party. The new Government will seek the vote of Confidence only on
10 June. Any meetings on the SSP are likely only after this.

5.  Gujarat oustees are getting more and more frustrated. These oustees,
who had never opposed the project but had sought resettlement with the help
of pro-dam NGOs, have been displaced over the last 12-14 years. Their
living conditions are now terrible, and the Government seems not to care.
Many are now joining the NBA, threatening to move back to their original
villages. On 30 May, 1996, over 600 of these oustees came to Baroda and in
an aggressive but peaceful demonstration, occupied the foyer of the office
of the Nigam (the corporation building the dam). They only wanted the
officials to come and discuss their problems. The official Mr. Rajagopalan
came only after 2 hours. He was extremely rude and arrogant and refused to
talk to NBA activist and walked out of the gathering in 5 minutes, rudely
cutting short the people who were speaking. This has come as the last straw
to the people, who declared their intention to "empty their resettlement
sites and return to the original villages" and warned the Government that
they will not allow the dam to be filled.

SALT CAVES HYDROPROJECT -- DEAD AT LAST!
 
UPPER KLAMATH RIVER
RECEIVES FINAL LEGAL PROTECTION
 
 
In Washington today, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission voted to dismiss the City of Klamath Falls' license application to construct the notorious Salt Caves Hydroelectric Project.   The project was proposed for construction on the Upper Klamath River in southern Oregon.
 
"This is the final nail in the coffin of one of the nation's most damaging proposed hydroprojects," said Tom Cassidy, General Counsel for American Rivers.   "This action is the final chapter in one of the great river conservation battles of the past decade."  
 
American Rivers and other organizations have fought to protect the Upper Klamath from this hydropower project since 1988.  In 1988, the citizens of Oregon added the Upper Klamath to the Oregon Scenic Rivers system by ballot initiative.  That same year, as part of the landmark Oregon Omnibus Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, the U.S. Congress authorized a study of whether the Upper Klamath should be included in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers system.  The federal study was completed in 1992 and found that the river was a suitable addition to the federal rivers system.
 
In 1992, Oregon Governor Barbara Roberts petitioned Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt to add the river to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, pursuant to section 2(a)(ii) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.  On September 23, 1994, Secretary Babbitt added the Upper Klamath to the national rivers system.
 
The City of Klamath Falls sued Secretary Babbitt to block protection of the river, however, in a May, 1996 decision, a federal court rejected the City's legal challenge.  American Rivers and other conservation groups, including the National Wildlife Federation, Oregon Natural Resources Council, Sierra Club and Save Our Klamath River intervened in that case, supporting the Wild and Scenic River designation.
 
In 1990, American Rivers identified the Upper Klamath as the nation's Most Endangered River because of the Salt Caves project.  
 
The Upper Klamath is known for its outstanding fisheries, whitewater, wildlife and historical values.  Diverse forests along the Klamath provide critical habitat for blacktail deer, wild turkey, bald eagle and other wildlife.  The Upper Klamath River Gorge has some of the best wild trout fishing in the state of Oregon, as well as exciting world-class whitewater.  No other river in the region offers such superb Class IV and V rapids for year-round rafting and kayaking, attracting boaters from all over America and generating over two million dollars a year in direct revenues for the rafting and fishing industries plus much more in indirect revenue.  The Klamath Gorge is also sacred land to the Shasta Indians.
 
If the project had been constructed, the last remaining free-flowing stretch of the river would have been severely degraded, thus threatening wild trout populations, whitewater recreational opportunities, wildlife habitat, and sacred Indian lands.  Moreover, the recreational resources of the Klamath River would no longer have been able to provide continued and considerable economic support to the Klamath Falls area by sustaining fishing and whitewater boating activities and tourism.

Subject: Idaho Rivers to be BOMBED!
Date: 13 Jun 1996 17:07:40 -0800 (PST)

Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit



The Air Force is proposing to build a bombing range next to the Bruneau, 
Jarbridge and Owhyee Rivers in Idaho!  This area is one of the best 
places in Idaho to enjoy the solitude of the desert.  It is fantastic 
hiking, Mt. biking and boating -- it is also important wildlife habitat.  
Your help is needed to stop this!

Idaho Rivers United had set up a web page that will automatically send 
letters to the Air Force telling them to stop this foolishness -- it is 
very easy and will only take 30 seconds of your time.  Please do this 
simple act to protect some of the best boating, hiking and wildlife 
habitat in Idaho.

Thank you

9 de julio 3563

Tel: +54-42-56-26-09

Santa Fe, May 13, 1996

To: Mr. Jorge Obeid, Governor of Santa Fe Province
       Mr. Gualberto Venesia, Vice-Governor of Santa Fe and President of
the Chamber of Senators
       Mr. Jesus Gonzalez, Coordinator of the Comision of Evaluation and
Followup of the Project for Integrated Economic Development of the
MiddleParana
       Mr. Ruben Mehauod, President of the Chamber of Deputies of the
Province of Santa Fe

From: Provincial Council of Environmental Non-Governmental
Organizations of Santa Fe

We are writing to request more information regarding the proposal of a
consortium of foreign companies, promoted in our region by provincial
legislative representatives to construct a hydroelectric dam on the middle
Parana River.  We are aware that these decisions should be made according
to the genuine interests of their constituents, avoiding decisions behind
closed doors.

We think that society as a whole should be protagonists in determining
their own destiny and that they have the right to be informed, as well as
to take part in decision making.  For this reason, the social organizations
which have signed below solicit the following:

1.  We ask you to explain the reasons which led to the acceptance of the
proposal, and whether these include a deficit of electrical energy.  This
as a result of the fact that we are surprised that the national government,
legislators and technical organs are pushing this project, even though the
details of the project are not publicly known, nor its possible
consequences for our region.

2.  We request that a process of public participation be initiated with an
adequate timeframe, so that different sectors of society, universities,
social organizations, labor unions, professors, farmers, and other affected
populations can reeive objective information which will permit them to know
and to analyze for themselves the characteristics of the project and its
possible consequences.

3.  That public audiences of sufficient breadth and with a reasonable
timeframe are carried out following a process of informing the public,
which provide a real opportunity to propose alternatives to the project.

4.  That the debate must include an analysis of alternative proposals for
sustainable development of natural and human resources for the middle
Parana valley, based upon respect and support for the cultural-economic
model already existent: agro-forestry, cattle raising on the islands,
production of rice and other appropriate crops, commercial and sport
fishing, fishculture, tourism, and other possibilities for utilization and
creation of sources of labor and production.

5. That a thorough economic study and analysis be carried out to acheive a
balance between possibilities for sustainable development and the creation
of wealth and employment mentioned in the preceding point, and which looks
at the proposal to construct the dam, taking into account its negative
environmental and social impacts.

6. That in this sense it is clearly specified who will be responsible for
the economic compensation to farmers, land owners, and populations affected
by the project in terms of:  loss of income from a loss of current and
potential productive activities, impacts on land and property -- including
the eventual salinization and/or elevation of the water table west of
provincial highway no.1 -- loss of jobs and natural subsistence activities,
and the possible expansion of tropical diseases from surrounding areas,
among other impacts.

7. That throughout this process Article 41 and its accompanying provisions
of the National Constitution be respected, as well as national and
provincial laws, and international treaties signed by Argentina, such as
the Treaty of San Jose, Costa Rica, the International Agreement on
Protection of Biodiversity, recommendations of the U.N. Summit on Social
Development, and others.

8. That an objective and impartial analysis of the consequences of what
appears to be an "experiment" be guaranteed, including its impacts on the
balance of this enormous natural hydrological system, which top
international experts have declared to be difficult to predict based upon a
lack of sufficient studies and data.  This objectivity cannot come from
those connected with the project nor from those expecting to make money
from it.

Finally, from different sectors of the people of Santa Fe, we demand that
the public authorities act wisely and judiciously as this case requires,
without making hasty decisions based upon outside and mutual interests, but
rather based upon the needs of our people.  These decisions risk leaving
the country dependent for 50 years upon the interests of foreign companies
and governments and which are not based upon preserving those resources
which bond human development, our cultural identity, security, and quality
of life.

With distinguished consideration,

          PRO AND ANTI WHALING FORCES SEEK SHOWDOWN AT WHALING MEETING

                Pro and anti whaling advocates are marshalling their
        forces to define the future of the International Whaling Commis-
        sion (IWC) when it holds its annual meeting in Aberdeen, Scot-
        land June 24-28.
                The IWC, established by the International Convention for
        the Regulation of Whaling in 1946, has been roiled by seemingly
        irreconcilable differences between those who want to conserve
        and manage whales for sustainable use and those who want to use
        the organization as a means of protecting whales from all harm.
                Under the Convention, the IWC was empowered "to provide
        proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the
        orderly development of the whaling industry."  But in recent
        years, strengthened by the addition of non-whaling countries to
        IWC membership, to the point where they command a three-quarters
        majority, anti-whaling advocates have changed the course and
        complexion of the IWC's actions.
                This year, most of the contentious issues will come to a
        head at Aberdeen.
                The big issue is whether the IWC has the authority to
        bypass the provisions of the Convention and change its purpose
        without the consent of all the member nations.  The issue has
        come up before but was not pursued to a conclusion in areas such
        as the commercial whaling moratorium, humane killing, and
        studies of small cetaceans.  In the past, member nations opposed
        in principle or practice to measures that did not conform to the
        provisions of the Convention either filed an objection and were
        exempted, or went along in a spirit of accommodation.
                This year the issue will be pressed in several areas.
                Foremost is the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary (SOWS), a
        measure prohibiting commercial whaling, but not whale research
        or aboriginal whaling, in the 13 million square miles of water
        surrounding the Antarctic.  The SOWS, passed in 1994, prevents
        the sustainable use of such abundant and fast reproducing spec-
        ies as minke whales. These are not endangered and number over
        three quarter of a million animals.  The SOWS was not approved
        by the IWC's Scientific Committee, the Commission for the Con-
        servation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the Scientific
        Committee for Antarctic Research or any other reputable scien-
        tific body.  A battery of opinions from legal experts contends
        that passage of the measure was illegal.
                Sustainable use advocates and many scientists and ju-
        rists will press hard at this meeting to get the IWC back on the
        road mandated by the Convention: the conservation, development
        and optimum utilization of the whale stocks.
                With the passage of the commercial whaling moratorium in
        1982, and at the request of the IWC, the IWC Scientific Commit-
        tee was assigned to develop a Revised Management Procedure (RMP)
        that would expedite the rebuilding of depleted whale stocks,
        ensure against future depletion, and provide a means of utiliz-
        ing abundant whale stocks at sustainable levels.
                The Scientific Committee worked for eight years to de-
        velop and test a faultless procedure. But the anti-whaling ma-
        jority of the IWC delayed its implementation, causing the
        chairman of the Scientific Committee to resign in protest.
        Those who oppose the resumption of whaling, even at sustainable
        levels, are expected to raise more roadblocks to incorporating
        the RMP with measures to ensure that catch quotas and research
        requirements are enforced.
                Another area of strong contention will be a proposed ban
        on the use of the electric lance.  The lance is used to elec-
        trocute whales not killed quickly with explosive harpoons.
        Anti-whaling proponents, however, allege that the device is not
        fast enough to qualify as a humane killing method.  Japan, which
        uses the electric lance, has data showing that the mean time to
        death when it is employed is 44 seconds.
                Adversaries of the proposed lance ban see it as just an-
        other device to prevent implementation of the Revised Management
        Scheme.  The ban is opposed, too, by those who see the whole
        humane killing issue as outside of the terms of the Convention.
                An effort to extend the authority of the IWC to dolphins
        and other small cetaceans also is expected to face strong oppo-
        sition at Aberdeen.  Three reasons given for opposing it are:
        The IWC Convention only provides jurisdiction over large whales,
        not small whales, dolphins or porpoises.  The UN Conference on
        the Environment and Development, the Convention on Biological
        Diversity, and a number of other conservation entities recommend
        regional management over international management for oceanic
        species with regional habitats, such as most small cetaceans.
        And third, most countries do not want to see small cetacean man-
        agement enmeshed in ideological disputes, as at the IWC.
                Other issues that will be raised at the IWC meeting are
        likely to be:
                * The new assessment of Atlantic minke stocks based upon
        new Norwegian sightings surveys.
                * The effects, if any, of pollution, global warming, and
        other environmental factors on the whale populations.
                                     -end-

        FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


                 RESUMPTION OF WHALING UNLIKELY TO POSE THREAT

                In 1961, there was good reason to be alarmed at the
        plight of the whales.  The great blue whale, the world's largest
        mammal, appeared to be hunted to the verge of extinction, like
        the right, gray and bowhead whales before it.  An outpouring of
        public concern became the basis of the environmental movement,
        prompting a flood of contributions and pressure to save the
        whales.
                Today, thirty-five years later, the call to save the
        whales still echoes.  But a reality check would leave most
        thoughtful people wondering why the concern persists.
                Consider:
                No one has hunted the great blue whale since the Inter-
        national Whaling Commission (IWC) banned its catch thirty years
        ago.  Commercial catches of right, gray and bowhead whales were
        banned sixty five years ago.
                Commercial catches of humpback whales were stopped thir-
        ty years ago.
                Commercial catches of Pacific fin whales were prohibited
        in 1976, pelagic stocks of sperm whales in 1979 and coastal
        sperm whale stocks in 1986;
                All other commercial whale catches, even those from non-
        endangered stocks such as the abundant minke whales, ceased in
        the 1987-1988 season.
                Since 1972, the commercial catch of whales was reduced
        from 32,000 per year to the 215 taken last year from a non-
        endangered Atlantic minke stock by Norway.
                That is not to say that depleted whales are no longer
        hunted.  But the numbers taken are too small to impair the
        stocks' recovery.  Traditional native whalers take almost 400
        whales each year for subsistence, with American Inuits allowed
        67 bowheads, Greenlanders 19 fin whales and 167 minkes, Russians
        140 gray whales and St. Vincent and the Grenadines 2 humpback
        whales.  This year the U.S. will ask the IWC for 5 gray whales
        for the Makah tribe of Washington State.
                Under the provisions of the IWC's Convention, member na-
        tions also can take whales for research purposes.  Japan is con-
        ducting a 16-year research study of minke whales.  The research
        requires the catch of 400 minke whales from a 760,000 minke pop-
        ulation in Antarctic waters and 100 minkes from a 25,000 non-
        endangered population off its Pacific coast.  The catches con-
        stitute less than one half of one percent of the populations.
                Almost all of the whale species appear to be increasing
        steadily in all of the world's waters.  There are sightings of
        increased numbers of blue whales off the California coast and
        the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  Australia noted a 12% increase in the
        number of humpback whales off its coasts.  The rare north Atlan-
        tic right whale rebounded from only 30 whales off the coast of
        the U.S. in the 1950's to 500 today.  And the Pacific gray
        whale, once thought extinct, has recovered to original popula-
        tion size. It was recently removed from the U.S. endangered
        species list.
                Only the great blue whale of the Antarctic appears to be
        lagging in its recovery.  A number of scientists attribute this
        to substantial increases in species competing for the same food
        supply, such as minke whales and crabeater seals.  The culling
        back of some minkes and seals may help the blue whale recovery.
                Blue whales and other depleted whale species will not be
        targeted even if commercial whaling is allowed to resume.
        Strict application of a well-tested procedure to calculate catch
        quotas does not permit the taking of any stocks which are at 54%
        or less of their original population sizes.  Only one half of
        one percent of the more abundant populations will be permitted
        to be taken, a number well below the annual rate of population
        increase for whales, which ranges from 4% to 14%.
                It is unlikely, too, that whales will ever be hunted as
        relentlessly as they were in previous times.  Since the mid
        1960's, the whole character of whaling has changed.  Nations no
        longer need whale oil, the resource that led to earlier over-
        exploitation.  Now, whales are taken solely for food, by coun-
        tries that traditionally consumed it in their food cultures.

Subject: HUMANE WHALE KILLING ISSUE
Date: 16 Jun 1996 08:04:48 -0800 (PST)

          HUMANE WHALE KILLING ISSUE CREATED TO BLOCK SUSTAINABLE USE

                If the animal rights advocates have their way, sports
        fishing and duck hunting may soon meet the same fate as whaling.
        People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has just
        launched a major campaign against fishing with hook and line and
        Australian animal protection groups are now agitating world-wide
        to ban duck hunting on the grounds that it is not humane.
                Ironically, the commercial hunting of whales is more
        humane than all other forms of hunting, and probably more humane
        than the way these animals normally meet their end.  Whales are
        put to death faster, and with less suffering, than other animals
        or fish in the wild.
                But the anti-whaling activists at the International
        Whaling Committee meetings are using the issue as a means to
        delay or stop the sustainable use of whales.
                This year, the anti-whaling activists who dominate the
        delegations of New Zealand, Australia, the UK and the United
        States, are trying to ban the use of a device that ensures
        whales a relatively painless death.  Their objective: to curtail
        progress towards adoption of measures that will permit abundant
        whale populations to be harvested at levels well below their an-
        nual rates of increase through reproduction.
                The device, employed primarily by Japan, consists of a
        pair of electric lances used to electrocute whales not killed
        instantly by explosive harpoons.  The old method of whaling used
        a non-explosive harpoon and led to prolonged times to death.
        But the Japanese developed a penthrite explosive harpoon head
        which killed whales instantly or shocked them into insensibility
        until they could be dispatched with a secondary killing device,
        such as a gun, or a lance.  The next development was an electric
        lance, a secondary device to dispatch the whales faster and with
        less pain.
                A few years ago, a group of New Zealand anti-whaling ac-
        tivists set out to prove that the electric lance was ineffective
        as a fast killing method.  Using dead cetaceans washed up on
        shore, they produced voltage and amperage readings that enabled
        them to claim that the electric charge would be dissipated by
        the aqueous environment of the ocean and would not be strong
        enough to kill the whales quickly.  Though their theory fails to
        conform to reality, the other anti-whaling groups echoed it
        noisily, to the point where the major anti-whaling nations at
        the IWC proposed to ban the electric lance.
                The theory  and the flood of propaganda to the contrary,
        the fact remains that the electric lance has proved to be a fast
        and relatively painless secondary killing method.  From the time
        the lances are inserted near the heart to the time all signs of
        life cease averages a well documented 44 seconds.  Death would
        not come this fast if the electric lance was ineffective.
                But the anti-whaling activists continue to embrace the
        theory and ignore the facts, just as they have ignored all of
        the work done by the IWC Scientific Committee.  Several years
        ago, this prompted the Chairman of the Scientific Committee, Dr.
        Philip Hammond, to resign in disgust over IWC decisions that
        "are nothing to do with science".
                All of this concern over the humane killing of whales,
        strangely, is only directed at Japan.  Not a word is spoken
        about the 400 whales killed annually by "native" hunters such as
        the American Inuits of Alaska or the subsistence hunters of
        Greenland who catch whales with non-explosive harpoons.
                Whatever the killing methods, however, the death of a
        whale at the hands of today's whaler is much more humane than
        the way whales die in the wild: afflicted by disease, drowning
        when old age or infirmities impairs their swimming ability, torn
        apart and eaten by sharks and killer whales, or their vital
        organs crushed by their own weight when they get beached.
                At least the commercial whalers have tried to make their
        deaths as fast and painless as possible, to the point where it
        is more humane than most other forms of hunting.  Whaling today
        complies well with the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, which
        states: "The term 'humane' in the context of the taking of a
        marine mammal means that method of taking which involves the
        least degree of pain and suffering practicable to the mammal in-
        volved." The operative word here is "practicable."

Subject: IWC BREACHED WHALING TREATY
Date: 23 Jun 1996 16:06:01 -0800 (PST)

                                            
        FROM: Alan Macnow
        Consultant, Japan Whaling Association


                      WHALING COMMISSION BREACHED TREATY
                          WITH WHALE SANCTUARY ACTION

        The International Whaling Commission (IWC) breached its own
        treaty when it designated 13 million square miles of ocean
        around the Antarctic as a sanctuary for 80 percent of the
        world's whales, according to legal expert Douglas M. Johnston,
        Professor Emeritus of the Law School of the University of Vic-
        toria in Canada.  The treaty, the International Convention for
        the Regulation of Whaling (Convention), contains specific re-
        quirements for establishing regulations, many of which were vio-
        lated when the IWC took the sanctuary action in 1994.

        Prof. Johnson is not alone in his criticism of the IWC.  A bat-
        tery of legal experts also found that the IWC acted improperly
        in preventing the sustainable use of abundant species of whales
        in the Antarctic area, particularly the fast-growing population
        of minke whales which now number over 760,000.  The other criti-
        cs  include Prof. William T. Burke of the Law School of the Uni-
        versity of Washington, Daniel J. Popeo of the Washington Legal
        Foundation, former Deputy Attorney General of the U.S. Bruce
        Fein, and international law expert Prof. Richard J. McLaughlin
        of the Univ. of Mississippi.

        The opposition view comes from Prof. Patricia Birnie of the
        U.K., who argued at last year's IWC meeting in Dublin that the
        whaling Commission could do anything it wants, even to the ex-
        tent of over-riding or ignoring its own treaty mandates, if that
        is the will of the majority. And what the majority dictates can-
        not be appealed because the IWC lacks a dispute settlement me-
        chanism.  Prof. Birnie said that the Convention rules can be
        changed in an evolutionary manner by the majority of the members
        of the IWC.

        In a paper to be released at this year's IWC meeting in Aber-
        deen, Scotland, Prof. William T. Burke disputes Prof. Birnie's
        assertions.  The underlying Convention, and particularly its
        rules, can only be changed with the consent of all of the
        parties to the agreement, he states.  Failure to do so violates
        the rights of the parties to the agreement.  Without unanimous
        agreement, all signatory nations are required to adhere strictly
        to the provisions of the Convention.

        Last year, Prof. Burke examined the issues and found that pas-
        sage of the Antarctic sanctuary provision violated the objec-
        tives, purpose and provisions of the Convention.  A total ban of
        whale harvesting of all whale stocks, regardless of the dif-
        ferent population levels in the vast area covered by the
        sanctuary, clearly contravened the purpose of the Convention.
        The Convention's purpose is "to provide for the proper conserva-
        tion  of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly devel-
        opment of the whaling industry."  As all of the depleted and
        endangered species were already fully protected from exploita-
        tion by hunting bans and a commercial whaling moratorium, fail-
        ure to allow sustainable utilization of abundant species con-
        travened the purpose of the Convention.

        The 1994 vote for the sanctuary ignored the provisions of the
        Convention which required all regulations to comply with the
        following requirements:
         (a) "be such as are necessary to carry out the objectives and
        purposes of the Convention and to provide for the conservation,
        development, and optimum utilization of the whale resources";
         (b)"be based on scientific findings"
         (c) "take into consideration the interests of the consumers of
        whale products and the whaling industry."
  
        All of the legal experts , except Prof. Birnie, agreed with
        Prof. Burke that the sanctuary measure had not met any of these
        requirements.  As noted, the measure would defeat the objectives
        and purposes of the Convention.  It was deemed not necessary
        both because the whales in need of protection were already given
        protection,  and because the Scientific Committee of the IWC had
        developed a faultless procedure to allow the taking of abundant
        species of whales at levels well below their replacement rates
        through reproduction.  And the sanctuary, of course, would pre-
        vent any utilization at all, much less the "optimum utilization"
        called for by the Convention.

        One of the most damning indictments of passage of the measure
        was  the IWC's failure to provide a scientific basis for the
        sanctuary.  The sanctuary was not endorsed nor recommended by
        the IWC's Scientific Committee, which never even had a chance to
        study it before passage.

        The issue of the legality of the whale sanctuary will come up
        for debate at the IWC's annual meeting in Aberdeen.
                                      -end-

an eight-track sequencer and
a powerful arranger into a unit small
enough to take anywhere. For the
musician on the go, this amazing
palm-sized music production
system is perfect for working out
phrases and taking down musical
memos, all the way up to full-on
compositions and arrangements. It's
also a perfect accompaniment
machine when performing and
practicing.</h4>
<hr>
<h3>A dream user interface.</h3>

The PMA-5 is a unique musical instrument
incorporating a touch-panel. No buttons,
switches or cables to hassle with. Access all
functions from the PMA-5 panel with a touch.
Data can be input via the keyboard display.
To edit, touch the parameter you want to
modify with the pen and drag it up/down to
change values. Creating music was never this
easy or intuitive. The PMA-5 really delivers the
promise of fun music making. It offers a level
playing field for aspiring composers.
<hr>
<h3>Choose an instrument.</h3>

Pick any one of the PMA-5's 306 instrument
sounds and 16 drum kits. These high-quality
sampled sounds have been taken from
Roland's high-end synthesizers. There are
even some brand new sounds. The selection
covers everything from realistic acoustic
instruments to rich synth textures, perfect for
any kind of music. All of the accompanying
instruments including guitars, basses and drum
sets are outstanding. And since the PMA-5 is
28-voice polyphonic, full-scale orchestrations
are easy. This well-thought piece even includes
digital reverb and chorus for adding that
professional touch to your music.
<hr>
<h3>Powerful eight-track
sequencer.</h3>

The PMA-5's sequencer has four melody
tracks and four backing tracks. It holds up to 20
songs or about 21,000 notes, enough to last a
whole set.
<hr>
<h3>Choose a style.</h3>

More than just a practice tool, the PMA-5's
amazing selection of diverse Music Styles are
substantial enough for professional use as well.
100 preset styles, rock and funk variations
included, are provided. Each has six sections
(Intro, Main A, Main B, Fill 1, Fill 2 and Ending)
for a total of 600 patterns. You can also
customize your own patterns and store up to
200 of them in the PMA-5. Simply select and
paste the style you want.
<hr>
<h3>Input your chord
progression.</h3>

Select a root with the keyboard and a chord
type from the 26 choices available. Inversion or
on-bass chords can be specified. Preview it to
make sure it's what you want. You can even
select anticipation for specific beats. You'll be
amazed at how this little music assistant can
effectively interpret everything from traditional
to intricate chord progressions.
<hr>
<h3>Play and record the melody.
</h3>
You've got your accompaniment ready to go.
Now pick your instrument and play the melody
on the touch keyboard to record it in realtime.
As you play the melody, you can drag a note
up/down to apply pitch bend and modulation.
Improvising over your input chord progression
is easy and quick -- just trace over the Ad Lib
bar to left and right. You can also record your
improv into the sequencer. The PMA-5
supports step recording and precise editing as
well.
<hr>
<h3>Putting it all together.</h3>

On the mixer screen you can adjust volume
level, panning, reverb and chorus levels for
each of the eight tracks. Add reverb and chorus
effects to give your music that professional
sound.
<hr>
<h3>Take your music
anywhere.</h3>

The PMA-5 operates on batteries so,
all you need are headphones to access
your personal studio anytime, anywhere.
Inspiration can strike at any time and you
need to be able to take advantage of it
right away! The PMA-5 looks just like an
electronic organizer. It's about the same
size and weighs less than 1.5 lbs./610g.
<hr>
<h3>Use it any way you like.</h3>

Use the Mute button to mute any part for
karaoke style accompaniments. This is
also great for practicing different musical
parts. Connect an optional foot pedal for
hands-free control of playback start/stop.
This is particularly helpful for guitarists.
Connecting a keyboard or sequencer to
the MIDI In turns your PMA-5 into the
smallest GM/GS compatible sound
module ever.
<hr>
<h3>Computer connection.</h3>

Because the PMA-5 has a computer
interface, you can connect it directly to
your computer -- Macintosh or IBM
compatible -- with a single cable. The
PMA-5 can exchange song and pattern
data with your computer, using the
optional PC Communication Kit. This
affords more elaborate sequence editing
using your software-based sequencer.
To minimize equipment hauling, you can
transfer sequence data from your
computer to the PMA-5 and take it to
gigs. Standard MIDI File music data or
your favorite phrase data can also be
loaded into the PMA-5.
<hr>
<h5>For the first time, there is a
musical product whose scope
isn't limited by size or other
logistics. It's there to give you
superior musical assistance
-- anytime, anyplace.</h5>

<h1>ADAT-XT</h1>
<hr><p>

<h2>The ADAT
      Digital Multitrack
      Recording Format</h2>

        Since its introduction as the
      world's first affordable modular
          digital multitrack in 1991,
      the award-winning Alesis ADAT
      has influenced every aspect of
      the recording world.  The ADAT
   format offers the ability to record
   eight tracks of 16-bit linear digital
         audio onto standard S-VHS
      cassettes with amazing clarity
      and audio fidelity, exceeding the
   sound quality of any analog multi-
      track recorder, while remaining
         affordable and easy to use.
      Specifically designed for profes-
       sional audio recording, ADAT
        recorders employ a modular
      design that allows you to use it
      as a stand-alone 8-track device,
      or to link several units to form
      a digital recording system from
        16 to 128 tracks.  This lets
           you expand your studio in
         increments that meet your
             needs and your budget.
<p>


           ADAT recorders dedicate
   separate ultra-high quality digital
      audio converters to the inputs
      and outputs of each individual
      track.  Also, the ADAT recording
   format never uses track sharing,
      where data from two different
      tracks is re-written in the same
      tape sector each time you over-
      dub, even if one of the tracks is
   in safe mode.  Instead, each scan
      of an ADAT tape is divided into
        eight sectors - one for each
   channel.  This professional design
      offers a higher margin of safety
      against accidental erasure and
      tape dropouts if a read or write
   error occurs.  ADAT's inexpensive
       S-VHS tape offers recording
      times of over an hour, making it
       the perfect format to handle
   any application from demo tapes
            to film post production.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>ADAT-XT</h2>

ADAT-XT is the groundbreaking next generation of the ADAT format.
 Building on the                huge foundation of 70,000 ADAT-format recorders
installed worldwi                  de, the ADAT-XT keeps the ease of use and great sound
that made the ADAT                      the most popular digital multitrack of our time, and
adds some trick                     s of its own.
<p>

    ADAT-XT's innovative design benefits from Alesis'extensive experi
 ence in tape-based digital recording media.  With its new operational
 features and even better performance capabilities, the XT operates up to
 four times faster than the original ADAT, offers an intelligent software-
 controlled tape transport, and provides onboard digital editing and
 flexible autolocation.  And although it offers more features and more
 power than ever before, ADAT-XT is still an incredibly affordable tool that
 sets the new standard in modular digital multitrack recording.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2> Incredible Audio quality</h2>
 ADAT-XT's audio quality is nothing short of stunning.  It improves on
 the high standard of fidelity set by the ADAT format, which has been
 used to record dozens of top ten hits and platinum-selling albums.
ADAT XT's sonic excellence starts with the latest ultra-high fidelity 18-bit,
 128 times oversampling analog-to-digital converters which provide
 better-than-CD audio quality.  On the outputs, the digital-to-analog
 converters offer 20-bit, 8 times oversampling performance for a flatter
 frequency spectrum, improved phase response, and less low amplitude
 distortion.  The result is a frequency response of 2OHz to 2OkHz plusminus 0.5dB
               noise ratio greater than 92dB.  Crosstalk between                  the 
channels   is better than -90 dB, and wow-and-flutter is unmeasurable.


<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Four Times Faster Intelligent Transport Control</h2>
No doubt about it: when you're recording,
every second counts.That's why the ADAT-
XT rewinds and fast-forwards up to four
times faster than the original ADAT.  Plus, its
advanced transport software continuously
monitors autolocation performance, and
the head constantly reads ADATs built-in
sample-accurate time code, even in fast wind
modes.  The result?  Much faster search and
lock times so your creativity doesn't get put
on hold while you wait to hit "Record".
Working with a multiple ADAT-XT system,
or in a SMPTE or MIDI synchronization
environment, sample-accurate lock is
achieved in just seconds.
    Even though its wind speeds are
greatly increased, ADAT-XTs intelligent
transport handles your tapes with care.
New Dynamic Braking software allows the
transport to quickly wind to locate points
while taking every precaution to treat the
tape gently.  ADAT-XTs transport software
is so smart that it realizes if it over- or
undershoots a locate point and corrects
for it the next time around.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Onboard Digital Editor</h2>
                                 High-quafity
                                 digital
                                 recording is
                                 only part of
                                 the ADAT-XT
 story.  More than just a recorder, the XT is a
 true creative tool.  The XT has built-in fea-
 tures that allow you to make flawless
 copy/paste digital edits between machines,
 or even within a single unit.  The new Track
 Copy feature allows you to make a digital
 clone of any track (or group of tracks) and
 copy it to any other track (or group of
 tracks) on the same recorder.  This valuable
 feature allows you to assemble composite
 tracks for digital editing.  For example, if you
record six "takes" of a guitar solo on sepa-
 rate tracks, you can choose the best sections
 from each track and use Track Copy to
 digitally build a single new track from the
 selected sections.  It's the key to digital
 editing for every application from comping
 vocals, to producing thick, rich tracks, to
 creating special sound effects for film, video
 and multimedia production.
<p>

      Using two or more ADAT-XTs and the
 Tape Offset feature, you can copy and paste
 not only from track to track, but from loca-
 tion to location.  Tape Offset is a powerful
 built-in tool for assembling the elements of a
 project with a minimum of repetitive over-
 dubbing.  It changes the relative tape position
 of a slave XT to its master, so you can "fly"
 audio to different locations on each tape.  For
 example, you can create the perfect vocal
 harmony for your song's chorus on tracks 7
and 8, then copy those tracks (with 1/100th
 of a second accuracy) to the next two cho-
 ruses on tracks 15 and 16.  Using the XTs
 built-in digital routing, you can copy from any
 track to any other track.  Most importantly,
 the copied tracks will be exact duplicates of
 the original, with no loss of quality.  And
 since a fiberoptic cable for digital routing
 is included with each ADAT-XT, there are
 no expensive extras to buy.
<p>

      The Track Delay feature allows you to
 delay the time reference of a track by up to
 170ms.  With Track Delay, you can easily
 change the groove (or feel) of a tune.  Track
 Delay is individually adjustable on each
 channel, and it's an excellent tool to fix slight
 timing errors in recorded tracks, such as a
 player who lags behind or rushes the beat.
 In recordings with multiple microphones,
 you can time-align each track, precisely
compensating for the spacing between mics
 with accuracy to 0.0001 seconds.  Imaging
 and impact can be perfected without the use
 of outboard signal processors.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2> Onboard Autolocator
 with Auto Record</h2>
 ADAT-XT provides quick access to multiple
 tape locations with its onboard 10-point
 autolocate system.  Four specialized locate
 points are tailored to make your recording
 sessions quicker and easier.  The Auto Play
 feature automatically enters Play the
 moment any autolocation point is reached;
 Auto Return automatically rewinds at the
 end of a loop. The Auto Record function lets
 you automate punch-in/punch-out times
 that are accurate to 1/100th of a second.
 Rehearse Mode allows you to enter and exit
 record modes without actually laying tracks
to tape.  To record on the fly, you can even
  use the individual Record Enable buttons to
  punch in and out of tracks.  As a combined
  system, ADXF-XT's automated functions
  make it easy to get your ideas to tape with
  speed and efficiency.
<p>

      The 10 autolocate buttons double as a
  ten-key pad for entering numerical data into
  the ADAT-XT for use with digital editing
  and other functions. This lets you quickly
  input specific locate points, precise offset
  times, track delay amounts, and other
  commands.  Also, each ADAT-XT includes
  its own remote control with transport and
  locate functions, and offers a footswitch
  jack for hands-free punch-in.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

  <h2>Comprehensive Vacuum
  Fluorescent Display</h2>
  ADAT-XT features a beautiful new multi-
  color vacuum fluorescent display. There's
  level metering with three modes of peak
  display to make sure you take advantage of
  ADAT-XTs wide dynamic range without
  running into digital clipping.  The tape
  counter shows tape time in hours, minutes,
  seconds and hundredths of seconds.  'Mis
  Counter may be set to show absolute time
  (from the beginning of the tape) or relative
  time (from a newly selected zero-point,
  selectable from a button on the front panel.
  Plus, you'll find indicators in the display for
  all locate and editing functions, as well as
  sampling rate, formatting, synchronizafion
  lock, tape presence status, and more.

<p>
<hr>
<p>
 <h2> Custom-Designed Solid
  Aluminum Chassis</h2>
 The strength and stability
  of the ADAT-XT is built
  on a solid, six-pound die-cast aluminum chassis
  that's designed for heavy-
  duty professional
  applications.  I'his custom-
  designed chassis serves as
  the mounting for the transport,
  head assembly, main PCB and digital
  converters, with a physically isolated
  housing for the power supply.  The chassis
  lessens torque stress on the transport,
  keeping it better aligned, lessening mechan
  ical vibration and protecting the components
  against wear and stress for superior long-
  term performance under adverse conditions.
 This precisely-engineered hardware design
  ensures years of reliable use.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>Flexible Audio
   Inputs and
   Outputs</h2>
   With ADAT-XT, you'll
   have several options for
   getting your audio signal
   to and from tape.  The
   servo-balanced 56-pin
   ELCO connector operates at +4dBu for fast
   and easy interfacing with consoles which
   offer +4 balanced or unbalanced inputs and
   outputs.  ADAT-XT also includes unbal
   anced -10dBV inputs and outputs on phono
   connectors.  Plus, ADAT-XT even has an
   electronic patch bay built in so it can be
   used with stereo and 4-bus consoles.  When
   you leave the world of analog behind,
   ADAT-XT's Optical Digital I/O is capable of
   carrying up to eight tracks at once com
   pletely in the digital domain. The Optical
   Digital I/O is a tremendously valuable tool
   for interfacing with other ADATs and XTs in
   a system, or any device using ADAT's digital
   protocol (see below).


<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>Compatibility
  and Support</h2>
 There are over 70,000 ADATs in use all
  over the world.  We included the ADAT
  MultiChannel Optical Digital Interface
  and the ADAT Synchronization Interface
  into the ADAT-XT to make it completely
  compatible with any ADAT-format recorder
  or other devices that use our proprietary
  digital protocol.  Tapes made on any previ
  ous ADAT can be used with the XT, and
  vice-versa, so you can trade tapes with any
  of the thousands of original ADAT owners.
  By using ADAT-XT, you are joining the
  largest digital multitrack user base in the
  world.  If you wish to collaborate with other
  ADAT or ADAT-XT users, you can simply
  record the basic tracks, send them your
  tape, and let them add new parts and solos.


<p>
When you want to supercharge your
  ADAT-XT system, the Alesis BRC Master
  Remote Control lets you command up to
  128 tracks from a single location, with 460
  namable locate points, SMPTE and MIDI
  synchronization, and extensive digital
  editing power.  The Alesis Al-l" offers
  sample rate and digital format conversion
  between ADAT-XTs Optical Digital
  Interface and AES/EBU and S/PDIF for
  mats.  For synchronization to video and
  film, the Alesis Al-2  offers compatibility
  with video recorders and editing systems
  (including TimeLine's Lynx-2 system),
  and can issue MIDI Time Code and translate MIDI Machine Control commands to
  the ADAT-XT.
<p>

       ADAT-XTs compatibility is not limited
  to the Alesis product line.  There are over
100 innovative manufacturers in the ADAT
Group (our 3rd party developer program)
that offer a wide variety of gear that is
designed for use with ADAT-format
recorders. These products (from manufac
turers like Yamaha, Digidesign, Roland, JL
Cooper, Korg, Fostex, Panasonic and
dozens more) include hard disk recorders,
synthesizers, signal processors and a variety
of interfaces that allow you to use ADAT-XT
in conjunction with other recording formats.
The resulting flexibility in equipment inter
facing allows you to create an integrated, all-digital recording studio that you can tailor in
  any way you choose.

<h1>Virtual Analog Synthesizer</h1>
<hr>
<h2>CONTROL PANEL</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>AMPLIFIER, GAIN</b>
Attack, decay, sustain and release.  That's what you need to shape a nice envelope.  The Nord tracks
smoothly without any stepping effects or digital glitches.  Programmable volume.
<li><b>OSC 1</b>
Offers Triangle, saw and pulse waveforms.  The pulse-width is adjustable.
<li><b>OSC 2</b>
Offers Triangle, saw and pulse, with adjustable width, wave forms.  The pitch can be set 5 octaves below
to 5 octaves above Osc 1 pitch.  The Oscillator can also be set to act as a noise source with a noise color
controller.
<li><b>SYNC</b>
Synching the Osc 1 to Osc 2 makes it possible to do varlous effects like the typical "bow" sounds.
<li><b>FM AMOUNT</b>
Combine the best of two worlds, the analog with the digital, in one synthesizer!  Nord Lead offers "Linear-
deep FM".  Warm analog sounds can easily be combined with or changed to FM type of sounds.
<li><b>PULSE WIDTH</b>
Nord Lead offers a true pulse-width modulation.  Perfect for soft string pads.
<li>MIX
Blend the two Oscillators according to your taste.
<li><b>LFO 1</b>
Modulate the pitch on Oscillator 1 and 2 or only Oscillator 2 with a Triangle, Sawtooth or Random
sawtooth.  Use the same wave forms to modulate the filter.  One extraordinary feature of the Nord Lead is
its ability to perform true "pulse-width modulation".  Nord Lead is the first digital keyboard on the market
that offers true modulation of the pulse-width.  A must for your string pads.
<li><b>LFO 2 / ARPEGGIATOR</b>
Play those exciting arpeggiator licks again.  Or use this section to modulate the amplifier or the pitch.
<li><b>MOD ENV</b>
This is a special feature.  It's an extra AD envelope to control the pitch of Oscillator 2, to produce e.g.
typical "bow" sounds, or to let FM to modulate the sound.  You can also use it to produce click and noise
effects.
<li><b>VELOCITY PROG</b>
This is one of the most exciting editing parameters for the Nord Lead.  Any parameter, controlled by a
knob, can be velocity dependent, For example; let a soft string pad become a funky clavinet sound through
keyboard dynamics.
<li><b>THE MANUAL BUTTON</b>
When you push this button, you can edit a new sound from scratch.
<li><b>PROGRAM</b>
The Nord Lead comes with 99 sounds and 100 performances.  An expanded Nord Lead with an inserted
PCMCIA RAM card can hold an additional 297 sounds and 300 performances.
<li><b>PERFORMING SECTION</b>
Play 4 different synthesizers simultaneously!  It's possible with the Nord Lead.  As you can see you have
four sound slots; A, B, C and D. Play them separately or layer them together You can use the Morph
function to blend all 4 slots with each other to create astonishing basses, leads and pads.
<li><b>UNISON</b>
Press this button to "widen and expand" the sound.  Unison mono fattens the sound even more. The unison
"detune" effect is also adjustable.
<li><b>POLY, LEGATO, MONO</b>
Playing modes.
<li><b>PORTAMENTO</b>
Adjust the portamento rate with the knob.  In Auto, portamento works only with legate playing.
<li><b>OCTAVE SHIFT</b>
Selects the basic octave for each sound.
<li><b>PITCH STICK</b>
Designed to change the pitch continuously without any dead spots.  It gives you complete control of the
pitch and allows you to make true and natural vibrato.  The effect increases exponentially as you move it
further from the centre.
<li><b>MODULATION WHEEL</b>
Traditional type of modulation controller Route to LFO 1 for vibratos, Osc 2 pitch for bend effects, FM
amount, filter frequency and to control the Morphing.
<li><b>FILTER</b>
Attack, decay, sustain and release.  The envelope acts fast and smoothly without any stepping effect or
digital glitches.
<li><b>FILTER TYPE</b>
Nord offers 4 different filters.  Besides the two most common types, LowPass 12 dB and LowPass 24 dB,
there are also HighPass and Band Pass filters.
<li><b>FREQUENCY</b>
Change the timbre of the sound with total sound control.  No stepping effects or glitch problems.
<li><b>RESONANCE</b>
Let the filter ring!
<li><b>ENVELOPE AMOUNT</b>
Sets the filter contour to your sounds.
<li><b>VELOCITY, KBD TRACK</b>
Control the filter envelope by velocity.  Thanks to Nord Leads velocity sensitive and fast keyboard, get
used to doing percussive and expressive licks.  The filter frequency follows the keyboard range.
</ol>
<hr>
<h4>VIRTUAL ANALOG</h4>
... combines classic ideas with today's technology.  This synthesizer has it all... and more.  Awesome leads,
booming basses, frantic techno atyour fingertips.  Every function has a knob.  No more menus!  Total real time
control and instant accessibility make it a breeze to shape the sounds exactly the way you want them.  Play with
the filter and resonance knob and enjoy the precise tracking and the superb sound quality.  You can program
any parameter change to velocity and do your licks.  Our new high precision "Pitch Stick" gives you complete
control of the pitch and allows you to make a true and natural vibrato -just like a violin player!   Add a whole
new dimension to your playing!
<p>

<h4>VELOCITY PROGRAMMING (MORPHING)</h4>
A special velocity programming section can be controlled by the modulation wheel making it possible to
continuously "morph' between two parameter settings.  This feature is a musically expressive tool that lets you
shape your sounds while you play.  This feature can also be routed to the modulation wheel.
<p>

<h4>MIDI</h4>
Let's go MIDI Triggering!  In the studio, Nord Lead offers real time MIDI recording of the knob settings and
special "MIDI patches" to recreate many of the effects produced by external patching on traditional units.  For
example, let your pre-recorded drumpattem trigger filter and amplifier envelopes, where the Hi-hat pattern
triggers the filter envelope and the Kickdrum pattern simultaneously triggers the amplifier envelope.  Use Nord
Lead in this way and you7l be able to create fascinating poly-rhythmic patterns. The programmable velocity
function can also be controlled from a separate MIDI source.  All MIDI triggefing can be done from separate
programmable MIDI channels.  The Nord Lead's LFO's and the arpeggiator can be synched to a MIDI clock.
<p>

<h4>FOUR SYNTHESIZERS IN ONE!</h4>
There are four parts which are directly accessible from the front panel.  This makes it possible to instantly
create layers with up to four different sounds, where each separate sound in the layer can easily be edited in
real time.  Make up super patches in the Performance section.  Create monster basses and mega pads.  But
it doesn't stop here.  The sounds in a layer can be programmed by the special Morph function making it
possible to fade sounds and parameters and create an unlimited number of exciting patches.
<p>

<h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3>
<h4>Sound generation</h4>
Nord Lead Is the first digital synthesizer to use "Virtual Analog Synthesis".  Clavia has analyzed analog
synthesizer design in detail and implemented the research in a digital model.  Nord Lead employs matemathical
simulations of the electronical signal generated by analog oscillators, instead of using waveform tables.  This
makes it possible, for example, to sweep the pitch smoothly over a very wide range and allow for true pulse
width modulation.

<h4>Voices</h4>
4 voices expandable to 12. 4 part multi-timbral

<h4>Special features</h4>
Velocity programming.. Each function, controlled by a knob, can be programmed to velocity.  Morphing: Each
function, controlled by a knob, can also be controlled by the modulation wheel / pedal to continuously fade
between two values.

<h4>Performance controllers</h4>
4 octave velocity sensitive keyboard with octave shift buttons (5 oct.). 
Modulation wheel, the "Pitch Stick" (featuring no dead zone at zero crossing), pedal input for sustain or
expression pedal.(Patent pending for the "Pitch Stick".)

So: U-pol
From: afn@afn.knooppunt.be (AntiFa Netwerk)
Newsgroups: ann.anti.fascisme
Subject: Vlaamse fascisten hebben nieuwe leider.
Date: Sat, 8 Jun 96 22:15:29 +0100

Het Vlaams Blok hebben sinds vandaag 8 juni een nieuwe leider. Voorzitter
voor het leven Karel Dillen 'eminance gris' van uiterst-rechts in vlaanderen
is 70j en zou over een wankele gezondheid beschikken. De nieuwe voorzitter
wordt Frank Vanhecke (37 jaar) en is Europarlementslid. Hij werd door Karel 
Dillen aangeduid als zijn opvolger, het kongres aanvaarde en bekrachtigde 
zijn mandaat voor 3 jaar. In zijn maiden speech haalde hij zeer sterk uit
naar jonge migranten en stelde hij een terugkeer met de beruchte C-130 
transporttoestellen in het vooruitzicht.

Frank Vanhecke is al jaren fractiemedewerker van Karel Dillen in het
Europarlement en sinds de laatste Euroverkiezingen naast Dillen het 
tweede fascistisch Europarlementslid van het blok. Hij is, net als Dewinter,
afkomstig uit Brugge en een studievriend van deze. Politiek staat hij 
volledig in de harde confrontatielijn van Philip Dewinter. Daarmee is 
de onderlinge strijd tussen Dewinter en Annemans blijkbaar beslecht in
het voordeel van Dewinter.

Subject: Di Rupo must be stopped
Date: 11 Jun 1996 11:46:33 -0000

Di Rupo wants to impose a tax on informationstreams, to finance industry
using a lot of handiwork. He asked the BIPT to quantify these streams.

I think we firmely must protest against this. Di Rupo wants to punish
Internetusers and to discourage the spread of Internetuse.

* New communication technologies do not destroy jobs, they create new jobs.

* New communication technologies give opportunities for democratic debate. 

* New communication technologies open new information resources for
everyone. A democratic state should stimulate the use of these
technologies by making Internet publicly accessible in all libraries. The
discrimination installed between printed and digital information makes no
sense. Digital information is faster and more upto-date, the more it does
not require the demolition of the rainforest.

If people want to plan actions against this vilain attack, they can use a
mailinglist we set up concering cyberrights.

Huh ?! Zijt ge nu niet een beetje paranoid ? Er is helemaal geen sprake
over een belasting op Internet-gebruik, maar wel op informatisering. Tuurlijk,
alle bedrijven die Internet hebben zijn per definitie ook geinformatiseerd en
zullen die belasting betalen. Maar ik zie het toch niet als een rechtstreekse
aanval op Internetgebruik hoor. Wat ik me nu wel plots afvraag is of dat weer
geen zet is van een franstalig politicus om een belasting te heffen die
hoofdzakelijk in Vlaanderen geld zal opbrengen ter bevordering van jobs in
Wallonie...

heyu trouwens het is de bedoeling dat internet in alle openbare

natuurlijk zoals altijd zeer vooruitstrevend is.

hmmm even rekenen: In de FET stond dat ze het willen doen volgens 'Amerikaans'
model, 1 miljoenste van een cent eisen per verstuurde bit.

dus voor 1Mbit transfer betaalt U dan .3 frankskens aan de staat.

De telelcom bedrijven moeten dit voor de staat doen dus zullen zij
1. nen teller zetten op de lijnen
2. lijnen gewoon inschatten (ah... 128 kb lijn ... da's dan zoveel frank per
                             jaar!)

In het ergste geval worden 'gewone' gebruikers ook het slachtoffer: mensen
met een (natuurlijk goedgekeurde) 28.800 modem en zo...

1 uur online: 28800 * 3600 = 103.68 Mbit getransfereerd (max)

we zijn vriendelijk: lijn voor de helft benut, dat is dan 15 bfr taks

(wel, bit // byte... het maakt natuurlijk een factor 10 uit :-) 

Dit is weeral eens typische belgische kloterij: we betalen ons blauw aan
taksen bovenop taksen. Elk nieuw initiatief wordt gewoon genekt. 

(herrinneren we ons nog de taks op beeldschermen?)


***** We betalen toch al taks op de tarieven van Belgacom?
5 --> 6 fr (20% of zoiets)

1 uur online === 10 (of 5) eenheden == 10 (5) bfr taks voor de staat



1 uur online: 50 bfr aan Belgacom
              10 bfr aan staat
              15 bfr aan Di Ruppo
              + providerkosten (die ook belastingen betaalt op zijn winst)


Dat gaat hier kostelijk surfen worden met high transfer Cable Modems @10 mbit

:-)

Zou wel eens kunnen kloppen,nu ze daar in de Waalse staal-industrie,opnieuw mensen

Wel ALS het zo zou zijn, zullen de Hollandse ISP'ers wel een inbelpuntje in

Volgens mij is het een stoot onder de gordel om Telenet Vlaanderen en de
vlaming een kloot af te trekken.  Vooral om die etter van een PS'sser het
geld wil gebruiken om in de bodemloze SZ-put te storten.  

Enkele redenen om internet-access goedkoper te maken, of ten minste niet te
belasten   
- bevorder telewerken via internet: 
  gevolg : minder verkeer, dus minder files, minder vervuiling, minder
onderhoudskosten aan de wegen, en minder nood aan "anti-ozon" maatregelen,
minder ongelukken, ...

Belasting op informatie verkeer is even ridicuul als belastingen op
brieven, waarvan de taks afhankelijk is van het aantal letters.

Het argument dat informatie-verkeer inkomsten genereert en dus het
alleen maar "fair" om ook belast te moeten worden is belachelijk, want die
inkomsten genereren winsten voor bedrijven, en die winsten worden al belast.
Dit is dus alleen maar een laag-bij-de-grondse vorm van EXTRA belasting.

Weg met DiRupo.

Als er zo iets idioots als dit moet doorkomen dan is het gedaan met dingen
zoals netnews. Ik begrijp die mensen in Brussel toch niet goed...
En wat gaat dat geven als we gaan beginnen met glasvezel (leuven anno 2000? :)
of wil ie dat misschien tegen gaan en terug met postduiven werken of zo.

Ik zie me over 5 jaar nog tax gaan betalen als ik van mijn thuis tot op de
hoek van de straat wandel. .000001 frank per stap dat een persoon maakt of zo.
Zit misschien ook een paar miljard in... 

Kan nooit goed gaan als een bende zeveraars die niet weten waar het over gaat
beslissingen gaat nemen. Heb het altijd amusant gevonden als een min. van
uhm gezondheid of milieu of whatever eens gaat beslissen hoe kernenergie
moet behandeld worden of zo.. knappe mensen daar... weten echt alles.

Belgie is precies naar een dictatoriaal landje aant gaan...

Misschien wordt het wel stilaan tijd dat de mensen wat meer laten horen over
hun mening ipv alles zo maar te nemen. k weet het niet...

Long live anarchy ? ;) Ge zou het nog gaan denken ook ;)

Ik weet niet of ge het beseft maar ee provider is ook een bedrijf. Naar
analogie van wat ik gehoord heb zal de particulier geen belastingen
betalen op wat hij doorstuurt, wel de providers omdat het diegene zijn die
ermee werken, en doorsturen naar de andere servers. Een slimme bedrijfslijder
zal dit dus doorrekenen aan zijn
klanten, want anders leiden zij verlies wat niet de bedoeling is voor en
bedrijf. 
Voor iemand die op den unif zit geen probleem die betalen toch al niks,
voor iemand die geen gratis acount heeft zal dus moeten betalen.

Wel, als BELNET dus een slimme commercieel direkteur heeft, dan 
rekent die deze kosten binnenkort door aan zijn klanten, onder andere dus 
ook aan de universiteiten. Die universiteiten rekenen op hun beurt door 
naar de studenten. En die laten de papies en mamies dan maar betalen.

Zie hierboven.... minder inkomsten van taksen op benzine.. minder inkomsten
voor de garagisten, lagere bonus-malus dus minder inkomsten voor de

Waarom eens geen belasting op 'stomme strikjes' (per bolletje of zo)

Voorstel van de week. 
Alleen moeten we de wet nog door het parlement zien te krijgen (en als 
de federale regering de wet niet goedkeurd, dan maar de Vlaamse 
=> de volgende keer dat hij dan in Vl komt mag hij direct een boete 
betalen met nalatigheidsintresten.)

Heren, heren,

Kunnen we dit hier afkappen?
Dit plus verhandelingen over Engelse gramatica heeft niets meer met het 
onderwerp te maken.

Ik had toch begrepen dat Di Rupo het niet had over informatisering, doch wel over het 
electronisch vergaren van informatie en wel degelijk via telefoonverbinding. Ik dacht 
dat hij wel degelijk het aantal bits, verstuurd en/of ontvangen via modem bedoelde. Dit 
betekent dus inderdaad niet enkel internet, maar alle electronische verkeer via modem 
(dus ook electronische bankverrichtingen...).

Dit impliceert wel een inderdaad bredere groep van slachtoffers dan de 
Internet-gebruikers, doch deze internet-gebruikers zullen een zeer grote groep van 
gedupeerden zijn.

Ook ik vind dat deze maatregel een mogelijk gevaar inhoudt om te worden gesoleerd van 
de vooruitgang, die volgens mij onvermijdelijk is, maar kan worden vertraagd erdoor.
Waarschijnlijk is juist die onvermijdelijkheid het aantrekkelijke. Een "melkkoe" die 
alleen nog maar kan groeien...

Niet waar. Het kost geen geld, het is genereert gewoon minder inkomsten.
De bedoeling van de staat zou niet mogen zijn "Zoveel mogelijk geld
afpakken van zij die het hebben" om het dan door PS'sers naar de SZ door
te sluizen.

Tegenargument: de computer- en telecom industrie verdienen bakken meer
geld, en worden dus meer belasten, en investering meer (door de groei van
de sector). Je kan dus alleen zeggen dat er een verschuiving onstaat, van
waar het geld vandaan komt/naar toe gaat.

Jamaar, dat is zowaar een aanslag op de fashion statements van DiRupo.

Staatsgevaarlijk individu!

Toch kan dit hoog oplopen. Als chatter op concentra krijg ik iedere keer
4 Kb toegestuurd. Het nadeel aan concentra is dat je zelf iedere keer
'nieuwe' informatie moet opvragen, maar niet iedere keer is er nieuwe 
informatie, dus zou ik moeten betalen voor ouwe informatie.
Leuk zeg.
Ik zal volgende keer eens kijken hoeveel Kb ik per 10 min verbruik.
Nog leuker is het surfen. Veel pages vallen tegen, maar ondertussen heb
je toch al de info naar binnen gehaald (en zul je moeten betalen).

Ik denk dat Di Rupo zich heeft laten meeslepen door een Urban Legend.

Of hoe fictie werkelijkheid kan worden.

<h1>DJ-70MKII Sampling Workstation</h1>
<h2>Quality and features for the perfect mix.</h2><hr>

<h5>The DJ-70mkII is an upgraded version of the DJ-70 Sampling
Workstation, which sets the standard for sampling workstations
among club DJs and remix artists. The DJ-70mkII provides everything
you need to create hot mixes, including professional sound quality,
a powerful sequencer, a 37-note keyboard, eight Play Pads,
a Scratch Dial and a large graphic display. In addition, the DJ-70mkII
comes equipped with a built-in SCSI interface, so you can store
and access a virtually unlimited selection of samples on external
devices. Memory is expandable to 32 Mbytes, so you can set
phrase lengths as long as you want, and a new master BPM function
lets you string sampled phrases together at a consistent master
tempo. With all these features, the DJ-70mkII is the natural choice
for club DJs, remix artists and broadcast professionals.</h5>
<hr>
<h3>Features</h3>
<h4>On-the-fly sampling and playback</h4>
With the DJ-70mkII, sampling couldn't be easier. Just connect
an audio source like a CD, tape or microphone to the audio
input, adjust the level and hit the Start/Stop button.
The DJ-70mIIl automatically loops the sample and assigns
it to the 37-note keyboard as well as any of the eight Play Pads,
ready for instant access. There's no complicated setup required.
The large graphic display makes it easy to monitor even the
most detailed editing procedures.

<h4>Professional sound quality</h4>
With 16-bit stereo sampling, the DJ-70mkII offers true CD-quality
sound equivalent to Roland's professional samplers, the S-760/
770/750. You can also choose between two sampling rates --
44.1kHz or 22.05kHz, depending on your requirements.

<h4>Extended sampling times</h4>
With a full 2 Mbytes of memory, the DJ-70mkII provides 22.5
seconds of mono sampling at 44.1kHz. Internal memory is
expandable to 32 Mbytes, enabling sampling times as long
as 6 minutes.

<h4>SCSI interface</h4>
In addition to a floppy disk drive, the DJ-70mkII also features
a built-in SCSI interface, so you can store a virtually unlimited
number of samples on large-capacity storage media and load
and play them at any time. The DJ-70mkII can use not only
hard drives and magneto-optical drives, but also affordable
high-capacity removable media devices that have recently
become available, such as the Iomega Zip Drive and Jaz Drive.
This makes it easy to carry or exchange data just like you do
with cassette tapes. By accessing CD-ROM drives, you can also
take advantage of a vast selection of high-quality samples from
CD-ROM libraries for Roland's S-series samplers.

<h4>Load-While-Playing</h4>
The DJ-70mkII can instantly load data from a hard disk
or CD-ROM while performing. This allows you to load and play
new samples without interrupting your performance.

<h4>On-board 8-track sequencer for quick and easy song
creation</h4>
The DJ-70mkII's 8-track sequencer records and plays back
keyboard input, as well as input from the front panel performance
controllers such as the Play Pads and Scratch Dial. When you
combine the sequencer with the DJ-70mkII's 24-voice polyphony
and 31-part multitimbral capability, you have a complete multi-
instrument mixing and recording console in one compact unit.

<h4>Realtime Phrase Sequence (RPS)</h4>
RPS lets you record a phrase on the built-in sequencer, assign
it to a key or pad, then play it back in real time. This gives you
access to long musical phrases while conserving sample memory.

<h4>BPM function</h4>
The BPM function lets you set your desired sample phrase
tempo easily and quickly by inputting a BPM (beats per minute)
value using the ten-key pad or tap-tempo pad. Using BPM, you
can take various phrases originally sampled at different tempos
and string them together for playback at the same master tempo.

<h1>MiniWorks EQ27</h1>
<hr>
The MiniWorks EQ 27 is a programmable 7-band stereo
equalizer that responds to MIDI commands. It features
top-class sound quality at a truly affordable price. The
equatizer settings may be saved in any of 60 program
locations and can be called via a MIDI Program Change
command. The MIDI channel is randomly definable.
This feature offers you the option of saving an
individual EQ setting for each of your synthesizer's
sounds, which is then automatically called when you
select a given sound. Each of the seven frequency
bands can be addressed separately via MIDI
commands. The two EQ channels may also be
addressed individually. Vou can also use your
sequencer to dynamically automate the EQ 27's
settings - of course without zipper noise. The requisite
adaptations for the popular sequencers' faderpages
are included.

<h1>DR16</h1>
<h2>16 track digital hard disk recorder/editor</h2>
<h5>Digital hard disk
recorder with
non-destructive editing
functions allowing near
instant data access,

and a 16 channel programmable mixer. It's
as easy to use as a conventional analogue
MTR machine but gives true 16 track
performance from a single hard disk at a
highly cost-effective price level per track.

Just what you would expect from Akai,
setting the standard in digital sound.</h5><hr>

<h3>Hard

disk

made
easy</h3>

With the Akai DR16, multi-track
recording and playback is as simple to
achieve as on a conventional MTR.
Familiar transport keys dominate the
front panel, and the DR16 punches in
and out of record on the fly just like
tape. Punches can be rehearsed and
repeated precisely using the Auto
Punch facility. The Take function can
store up to five trial recordings on one
track so allowing audition and selection
of the best performance or take. If you
make a mistake, the Undo function lets
you go back a step and try again. But
the DR16 does not stop at traditional
tape replacement alone. Proprietary LSI
chips developed for the Akai DD1500
dedicated post-production system allow
16 tracks of 16 bit linear digital audio
recording and playback from a single
SCSI hard disk.<p>

Disk size can be chosen by the user
with approximately 16 x 12 track
minutes at 44.1kHz available per 1Gbyte
disk memory. Connection to external
storage systems is easy and reliable; up
to six SCSI devices can be connected
via the SCSI interface including
magneto-optical disk drives, which allow
4 track recording and 8 track replay and
can also be used for data back-up. The
digital interface fitted as standard
makes data mixes directly to DAT.
Mixing is made particularly easy when
used in conjunction with the MT8. This
allows full control of the on-board
automated digital mixing without the
need for external sequencers, and can
be further enhanced by the EQ16 board
which provides 16 channels of three
band realtime EQ.
<hr>
<h3>Total
editing
with
zero loss</h3>

Editing functions have a logical and
familiar feel. But to benefit from the
possibilities of non-destructive hard disk
editing using the DR16 is a liberating
experience for the creative mind.
Random access to the disk means that
audio isn't copied physically as in
conventional systems, but can be
instantly played back in the edit
sequence on command from the
original audio data on the disk. You can
copy, repeat, move and insert or erase
phrases across multiple tracks without
using up any of the disk memory, and
play back the edit instantly with no loss
of original data.
<p>
Central to the system is the DR16's
Jog/Shuttle control for easy edit at any
speed determined by the operator
while monitoring playback; 9 locate
points and 100 stack points make the
edit point accessible directly.
<p>
The DR16 has a 16 channel
programmable mixer with on-board
snapshot and fade automation. Mix
mode allows the setting and recording
of level, pan, 2 x FX sends, bus on/off
and fade. The internal mix can be
recorded back to two tracks so
allowing sub-mixes and masters to be
recorded on the same disk drive.
<p>
Up to seven DR16s can be slaved to a
master unit using an ALX50 remote
cable giving a total track capacity of
128. Alternatively a mixture of DR16s
and DR8s can be used in any
combination, providing the user with an
extremely flexible expansion path.
<hr>
<h3>Solid
gains from
flexible
system</h3>

Any options required need only be fitted
to the master; the slave units will
automatically synchronise to the master
with sample accuracy. The IB801S
SCSI-B interface board option allows
connection to personal computers and
other peripherals, giving access to the
wide range of dedicated software
available.
<p>
The DR16 is the newest member of the
Akai hard disk recording family, sharing
its advanced component design with
the DD1500 digital audio post-
production workstation. It has high
density 18-bit 64-times oversampling
A/D converters and 20-bit 8-times
oversampling D/A converters for Master
and Send outs (18-bit 8-times
oversampling for Track 1-12 outs).
<hr>
<h3>Creative tool
of a musician</h3>

Drawing on Akai's extensive experience
with musical equipment, the DR16 is
able to integrate powerfully with the
musician's recording studio.<p>
Fitted with an IB803M MIDI
interface board, the DR16 can be
controlled via a MIDI sequencing
system. MIDI Machine Control from the
sequencer can be used to operate all
DR16 transport functions; realtime
dynamic digital mixing can be recorded
as part of the sequence and the DR16
transmits either MIDI Clock or MTC to
ensure everything stays perfectly in
sync. To make life easier, edits can be
displayed in Bars, Beats and Clocks.<p>
The IB804A Alesis ADAT digital
interface allows 8 channels of digital
audio to be copied in real time between
the DR16 and ADAT compatible
machines. It can also be used to make
a data back-up in ADAT format of all
16 tracks with edits.<p>
Not only is DR16 perfect for
multi-track recording, but the on-board
digital mixing can be enhanced by the
addition of the optional EQ 16 card to
provide real-time EQ. The mix can be
controlled via the dedicated MT8 Mixer
Controller, and two MT8s can be
connected to provide 16 faders if
required. All mixes can be mastered
directly to DAT with the AES/EBU and
SPDIF interfaces which are fitted as
standard.
<hr>
<h3>Pro Audio/Broadcast Application</h3>

Benefiting from the technology
developed for the DD1500 workstation
the DR16 provides unique
synchronisation and machine control
capabilities when fitted with the
appropriate optional interface boards.<p>
The IB802T SMPTE interface
board allows the DR16 to follow
external timecode formats backwards
and forwards even in slow motion,
maintaining phase lock accurate sync.
Add to this an IB805R RS422 interface
board and the DR16 can control any
standard type of professional VTR
providing integrated jog/shuttle of audio
and picture together from the DR16
front panel The IB805R also allows the
DR16 to be controlled remotely from
external edit controllers or synchronisers
using standard 9 pin protocols.<p>
Uniquely, Akai's experience in the
film industry has resulted in the
development of the IB805B Bi-Phase
interface board which allows the DR16
to integrate with film-based technology
and also enables conversion between
timecode and Bi-Phase.<p>
These interfaces are handled by
a multi-tasking operating system which
means it is possible for the DR16 to
control a VTR while in turn (when fitted
with an IB8Q3M MIDI interface board)
being controlled from a mixing desk
sending MIDI machine control (MMC).
All this and 16 channels of digital audio
and mixing as well!

<h1>Yamaha Control Synthesizer CS1x</h1>
<h2>Analog-style realtime controls plus dynamic digital dimensions let you create sizzling Rave, Dance and Techno music.</h2>
<h3><b>Set fire to the house...</b>
Introducing the Yamaha CS1x Control Synthesizer - the ideal instrument for creating the most sizzling Rave, Dance and Techno music in the house. The CS1x is a modern-day MIDI performance instrument which combines familiar analog-style synth sound-shaping and performance features - like filter cutoff and resonance knobs and other realtime controllers- with the digital convenience of AWM2 voices, Performance storage, Scene recall and other one-touch operations- all designed to set fire to tour creative powers.</h3><hr><p>
<ul>
<li>480 normal voices and 11 drum kits (XG format)
<li>128 Preset and 128 programmable User
Performances (up to 4 voices. or "Layers".
assigned to each Performance)
<li>6 realtime Sound Control knobs (2 assignable)
<li>2 one-touch "Scene" memory buttons (for each
Performance) to instantly recall specified Sound
Control knob positions
<li>Edit modewith all parameters displayed on the
panel for instant access to any setting
<li>Arpeggiator pith various types and timing

<li>16-part multitimbral capabilities for XG and GM
music production and playback (with an external
sequencer or computer)
<li>1 Performance (4 Layers) plus 12-part
multitimbral capabilities, convenient for adding
externally sequenced backing to your realtime
performance
<li>Built-in TO HOST computer interface
<li>Stereo LINE INPUT for adding audio signals from
a sampler or other system component
</ul>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Digital Sound, Analog-style
Realtime Control</h2>

The Cs1x gives you unprecedented
realtime control features which let you
"design the sound" as you play. Simply
grab the Filter Cutoff knob and change
the cutoff frequency, or turn the
Resonance knob one way and
another -- to completely transform the
characteristics of the sound. There are two assignable knobs which let you
determine which parameters you want to control in realtime.<br>
Press one of the Scene buttons to instantly recall specific position settings of
the six Sound Control knobs. Or roll the assignable Modulation Wheel back
and forth to continuously change the sound between one Scene and another
as you play. In all, there are three Scene variations in each Performance -- the
original settings for the basic Performance sound plus the two Scene settings.
<hr><p>
<h2>Arpeggiator Adds Unique
Creative Dimensions</h2>

The CS1x's Arpeggiator automatically creates arpeggiated chords based on the notes
you play on the keyboard, giving you enormous power to create unique sonic atmospheres and moods.
You can choose from a list of 30 Arpeggiator types
(including types which control filter cutoff and panning)
and timing subdivisions, as well as set the Arpeggiator
tempo. You can control the Arpeggiator tempo by an
external MIDI clock, from a sequencer, rhythm
 programmer or computer. Arpeggio Hold causes the arpeggios to continue looping even when you take
your hand away from the keyboard, and Arpeggiator Split lets you play the arpeggiated chords to the left of
 the split point, and normal notes and chords to the right. Arpeggiator data can be memorized in each
Performance for future recall.<hr><p>
<h2>Performances & Intuitive Edit Matrix
Let You Create Highly Complex Synth Textures</h2>

The CS1x comes filled with 128 Preset and 128 User Performances.
You can edit any Performance in a variety of ways, and store it in one of the 128 User
Performance memories. There's no need to search for hidden functions in pages and pages of
submenus. A list of Edit menus with various parameters are printed in a matrix right on the
CS1x's front panel, to give you instant access to any setting, as well as enormous control over
minute aspects of the sound.
You can also select and control the
amount of the three digital effects
applied to the sound -- from 11
Reverb types, 11 Chorus types and
43 Variation types of effects.<hr><p>
<h2>An Ideal Addition To Any MIDI Music
or Sequencing System
</h2>
Besides being an exceptional performance-based
synth, the CS1x is also ideally suited for desktop
music production, or convenient integration into any
expanded MIDI music system, by connecting it to
samplers, sequencer and computers.<br>
As a 16-part multitimbral XG format compatible tone
generator itself, you can use the CS1x with a
sequencer (or computer with sequencing software) to
record and play back the various instrument parts
across the 16 MIDI channels.<br>

Also convenient is the CS1x's 1 Performance (4
Layers) plus 12-part multitimbral capability, which lets
you add externally sequenced backing to your
realtime performance -- especially suitable for creating
powerful Dance and Techno music, and more.

<h1>Performance Controller PC-88</h1>
<hr>
<h2>KURZWEIL Quality Sound: Micro Piano and more...</h2>You want the brilliant KURZWEIL sounds that musicians everywhere aspire to own; and you need a
great-feeling master keyboard to drive your MIDI sound modules.  Now you can have both, in one
superbly-integrated instrument: the <i>PC88 Perforinance Controller</i>.<br>
The PC88 has it all: the benefits of a 32-note polyphonic portable digital piano, expandable to 64 voices
with an option board; KURZWEIL quality sounds you won't find anywhere else; plus an extremely
versatile MIDImaster keyboard with fully-weighted 88-key piano action.
<p>

<h2>MIDI TO THE MAX</h2>
Our MIDI Controller section is designed for fast, intuitive access, with full MIDI functionality. The <i>PC88</i>
can transmit on four MIDI channels simultaneously, is 16-part multi-timbral, and offers four completely
independent zones which can overlap.  Each zone has access to all controllers: pitch and mod wheels, four
continuous pedal controllers, two footswitches, four front-panel sliders, three switches (momentary or
toggle) and keyboard mono pressure.  The controllers can generate both positive and negative values for
easy crossfading.  There's also an arpeggiator which can be synced to MIDI an can operate across any or
all four zones, plus specified key ranges.
<p>

<h2>PAINLESS EXPANSION</h2>
You can easily upgrad the PC88 with an optional expansion card, offefing over 20 more presets, as well a
full General MIDI compatibility.  The expansion card also offers additional 32-note polyphony, giving you a
full 64-voic instrument with over 265 sounds.  There's a second independent stereo effects processor for
the expansion section, so you can split or layer expansion sounds and presets, with independent effects on
each.

A CAUTIONARY TALE: 
Failed U.S. Development Policy in Central America

by Michael Conroy, Douglas Murray and Peter Rosset 
May, 1996, Food First Development Studies, 
Lynne Rienner Publishers ISBN 1-55587-630-7


Neither structural adjustment policies, nor 
industrialization, nor traditional agricultural exports 
have led to sustained economic growth and social equity 
in Central America. Seeking to reinvigorate the region's 
struggling economies, U.S. AID -- supported by the World 
Bank and the IMF -- designed a new development policy, 
one based on nontraditional agricultural exports. Crops 
ranging from passion fruit and broccoli to macadamia 
nuts and melons, have been vigorously promoted through 
massive foreign aid and fierce pressure on local 
governments. 

This book dissects the varied impacts of a decade of 
this central AID policy -- impacts on the environment, 
on the livelihoods of thousands of small farmers, and on 
the sovereignty of elected governments. An anatomy of 
failure, of a policy gamble run amuck -- the book is a 
cautionary tale that is must reading for scholars, 
practitioners, policymakers and students of 
international development, economic globalization and 
U.S. foreign policy.

You have reached the Latin America Working Group hotline, updated
June 4th.  Topics include the Ending of the Pastors for Peace Fast and
declassification on Guatemala and Honduras.

               Pastors End Fast, Computers Released

On May 24th the Pastors for Peace settled their dispute with the Treasury
Department regarding 395 impounded computers.  They also ended their 94-day fast.  In late February, Pastors had attempted to ship the computers to
Cuba where they were to be used in the Cuban health care system.  The
U.S. embargo on Cuba allows for the export of such humanitarian items,
but only if a license is granted.  Pastors, in protesting what they consider to
be an immoral law, had refused to apply for the license.  

Under the agreement, Treasury released the computers to the United
Methodist Church.  Pastors are continuing to ask for phone calls to ensure
that the computers are sent on to Cuba.  Call Secretary Rubin at Treasury:
202-622-1100.  Also call Leon Panetta at the White House: 202-456-6797.   
                          
        Declassification Begins on Guatemala

In response to Sister Dianna Ortiz's five week silent vigil and fast, and
hundreds of constituent calls drawing attention to the declassification issue,
which helped to inspire strong congressional interest, the State Department
declassified and made available to the public 5,874 U.S. government
documents on Guatemala.  These documents cover 17 cases of U.S. citizens
affected by violence in Guatemala, including the cases of Jennifer Harbury's
husband Efrain Bamaca, Sister Dianna Ortiz, Michael DeVine, Nicholas
Blake, Griffith Davis, and Fr. William Woods.   The case of CIA paid asset
Col. Julio Alpirez is also included.  The State Department did not explicitly
search out documents on cases of Guatemalan citizens but did make a
limited number available.  It is likely that there will not be much new and
revealing information found in these documents.

Other agencies, outside of the State Department, including the CIA and the
Department of Defense, are expected to declassify some documents only
after the completion of the Intelligence Oversight Board's investigation of
the Bamaca and DeVine cases, which is now estimated to be finalized at the
end of June.  The CIA, other intelligence agencies and the Department of
Defense would be more likely to know the deeper secrets such as, for
example, whether U.S. paid assets were involved in human rights abuses.  

You might want to write to the White House to:

     congratulate the State Department for releasing these documents but
     to ask the administration to ensure that the CIA and other intelligence
     agencies and the Defense Department declassify documents as fully
     as possible. 

     In addition, urge the administration to release to the public the full
     text of the Intelligence Oversight Board's report on Guatemala when
     it is completed in the near future.  President Clinton, 1600
     Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington DC 20500.

            Declassification on Honduras

On Honduras, the administration has also just begun the declassification
process.  The first significant papers just released were State Department
documents on the case of Father James Carney, an American priest who was
killed in Honduras in 1983.  An initial review of the 587 pages of documents,
unfortunately, reveals little new information about Father Carney's death.  

In regards to Honduras, as with Guatemala, the State Department should be
applauded for its response in declassification.  However, this is only a first
step.  The Carney case is but one small part of the Honduran Human Rights
Commissioner's original declassification request.  Other information is being
awaited from the State Department. 

You can access this hotline on peacenet at carnet.congress.  Thank you
for calling the Latin America Working Group hotline

Subject: INITIAL THOUGHTS ON THE IOB REPORT
Date: 01 Jul 1996 07:00:16 -0800 (PST)

Latin America Legislative Hotline, 1 July 1996


On Friday, June 28, the President's advisory Intelligence Oversight Board released the public
version of its report on Guatemala, fruits of a more than year-long investigation.  Some U.S.
government documents were declassified at the same time, adding to the State Department
documents declassified in May.  The following are some first thoughts on the implications of this
report.     The public report in its entirety may be found on the home page of the Center for
International Policy.

Some initial thoughts on the Intelligence Oversight Board report on Guatemala

This does not evaluate the IOB's treatment of specific cases, which is being looked at carefully by
victims and relatives.  Nor does it assess the documents just declassified, which we have yet to
review.    These are some more general thoughts as we all begin to evaluate the report.

I.   While the Intelligence Oversight Board's report on Guatemala is
disappointing in its inconclusiveness and, especially, its failure to evaluate
appropriately overall U.S. policy in supporting the Guatemalan military and
intelligence services,  there are a number of recognitions and conclusions
within the report that should be emphasized.  These include the following:

A.  CIA assets were credibly alleged to be involved in serious human rights abuses, and the
CIA knew this.

"In the course of our review, we found that several CIA assets were credibly alleged to have
ordered, planned, or participated in serious human rights violations such as assassinations,
extrajudicial execution, torture, or kidnapping while they were assets--and that the CIA's
Directorate of Operations (DO) headquarters was aware at the time of the allegations." (p. 3) 

The asset validation system did not address human rights allegations.  "This validation system,
even if it had been functioning as intended, would not have highlighted human rights issues
because it had been designed to focus almost exclusively upon assets' vulnerability to
counterintelligence and upon dropping non-producing assets from the payroll."

Only in September 1994 did the CIA conduct a review of its assets throughout Latin America to
determine if any may have violated human rights.  We have no way of knowing how thorough this
review was.  Only in February 1996, "largely as a result of the inquiries related to Guatemala," (p.
4), did the CIA issue guidance for dealing with serious human rights violations or crimes of
violence by assets and liaison services.

B.  The CIA failed to inform relevant administration officials and Congress:

"Although National Security Council officials and State Department officials at the embassy and
in Washington were generally aware of the CIA's activities and liaison relationships in Guatemala,
the CIA did not inform these officials until the end of 1994 and early 1995 that any of its assets or
contacts were alleged to have committed human rights abuses.  These policy officials were thus
denied information relevant to their decision-making and lost any opportunity to express possible
concerns that such asset relationships undermined US policy on human rights." (p. 25)

"The IOB found the CIA's performance in notifying Congress to have been inadequate. 
Specifically, the IOB concluded that the CIA leadership violated its statutory obligation to keep
the Congressional oversight committees  fully and currently informed' under Section 413 of Title
50 of the US Code.  Though this statute is not criminal and the standard is too broad to be
fulfilled to the letter, CIA officers, particularly senior leaders at CIA headquarters, were derelict in
failing to provide information they should have provided under even the narrowest reading of the
statute."  (p. 26) The IOB credits this failure to inform Congress to the absence of a systematic
notification process and inadequate emphasis on the part of CIA leadership.

C.  The CIA station in Guatemala was not a rogue station.  

The IOB determined that the CIA station was not a rogue station, rather, "it generally kept the
DO headquarters well-informed of developments, negative or otherwise, including allegations
implicating CIA assets as each allegation surfaced."  (p. 4)  Therefore, the CIA station's actions
within Guatemala can be viewed as approved CIA policy and CIA policy judged accordingly.

D.  US policymakers knew of the "unsavory reputation" of the Guatemalan intelligence
service D-2 and the Department of Presidential Security (known as the "Archivos"), and
also knew of the CIA's liaison with these services.

Not only was the Guatemala station not a rogue station, but the CIA was not a rogue agency. 
This liaison relationship with institutions that systematically violated human rights was known by
US policy makers and should be judged as part of US policy.  

E.  The funds the CIA provided to the Guatemalan liaison services were vital to the D-2
and Archivos.  Relevant US policymakers knew that such funding flowed.

"The funds the CIA provided to the Guatemalan liaison services were vital to the D-2 and
Archivos.  This funding was seen as necessary to make these services more capable partners with
the station, particularly in pursuing anti-communist and counternarcotics objectives.  The CIA,
with the knowledge of ambassadors and other State Department and National Security Council
officials, as well as the Congress, continued this aid after the termination of overt military
assistance in 1990." (p. 20)

This is one of the most significant revelations within the IOB report, although it simply reconfirms
publicly what has been long known.  Despite knowing of the Archivos' and D-2's reputations, and
without acknowledging it to the U.S. public, the State Department and the U.S. Congress allowed
funding to the D-2 and (presumably) Archivos, not simply to pay assets to provide information,
but specifically to strengthen these services' capacity.    The IOB does not make the connection
regarding what effect such support would have on US policy goals to promote human rights and
democracy.   Nor is there discussion of the dilemmas of counternarcotics efforts done in
conjunction with a military some of whose members were/are involved in drug trafficking.

Unclear exactly who in Congress was informed of what; was it just the intelligence committees?

In the meantime, the U.S. public was simply informed that U.S. military aid had halted in 1990.

F.  The CIA consistently underemphasized human rights abuses by the Guatemalan
military and endeavored to put a positive spin in its human rights reports to Congress.

From 1989 to 1994, the CIA was required to provide semi-annual reports to Congress on how
programs in Guatemala had been used "to further the objective of greater respect for human rights
and what specific action will be taken in the ensuing period to further that objective."  The CIA's
reports "did not include information in the possession of the CIA concerning significant
allegations of human rights abuses by the D-2 and Archivos.  The omission of some of this
information in reports that repeatedly referred to the security services' roles in protecting human
rights painted an incomplete picture of the Guatemalan security services." (p. 31)

In briefings of congressional oversight committees, CIA briefers also failed to provide some
clearly relevant information.

G.  The IOB investigation turned up evidence, which was notified to Congress (but not to
the public), that the Department of Defense had found that the School of the Americas and
Southern Command used instructional materials in training Latin American officers,
including Guatemalans, from 1982-91, that appeared to condone practices such as
executions of guerrillas, extortion, physical abuse, coercion, and false imprisonment (p. 32).

This is a very significant finding.  These instructional materials were used throughout nearly the
entire Reagan and Bush administrations, only being replaced towards the very end of the Bush
Administration.  Moreover, these training materials were used considerably after the scandal
created by the  similar "CIA training manual for the contras" which was discovered and publicized
in the mid-80s and stirred considerable public outrage.

This adds one more argument to the case to close the School of the Americas.  Proponents of the
School deny anything unsavory has been taught at the school and discount graduates who commit
human rights abuses as "a few bad apples."  

H.  Cold War attitudes prevailed among CIA officers dealing with Guatemala, despite the
ending of the Cold War.

"The end of the Cold War gradually led to lower funding levels for the station, but had only a
limited effect upon the mechanics of how the CIA carried out its business and upon the mind-set
of the CIA officers dealing with Guatemala.  Station officers continued to view the communist
insurgents--who seemed to threaten a more democratic government--as the primary enemy, and
they viewed the Guatemalan government and security services as partners in the fight against this
common foe and against new threats such as narcotics and illegal alien smuggling." (p. 20)

I.  The CIA station and U.S. embassy in Guatemala requested assistance from the D-2,
because it was perceived as the most "elite" element of the Guatemalan military and
government.

"Because the D-2 was widely considered to be the elite within the Guatemalan military and
government, the station also often requested and received administrative and logistical assistance
from the D-2 on behalf of the embassy."  (p. 20)  The IOB quotes this approvingly as having
helped U.S. goals in combating narcotics, combating communist insurgents and rescuing an
American girl kidnapped in 1994.  However, we have to strongly question what the effect such
apparently direct appeals to one of the worst units of the Guatemalan military by U.S. officials
would have on the enormous problem of lack of civilian control over the Guatemalan military.

J.  Intelligence regarding cases was inadequately shared with families and victims.

"The Freedom of Information Act establishes the only legal requirement to provide such
information, yet that process is often an unsatisfactory way through which to communicate the
information to the families and victims."   (p. 8)  The IOB found that the administration should
provide families and victims with assessments of the reliability of the intelligence reports on their
cases, and should provide more information than it has in the past, whenever possible.  The IOB
identified a number of cases where intelligence reports with relevant information were not shared
with victims or families, or were shared only after much delay.  For example, despite Jennifer
Harbury's repeated requests since early 1993, the State Department did not request a search of
past intelligence on the case until October 1994.  In the Blake case, the National Security Agency
made an inadequate search of its database and provided the family with only 6 of 22 documents
available.


II.  In a number of areas, the Intelligence Oversight Board, in part responding to
its limited mandate, did not provide a sufficiently in-depth and independent
analysis.  These would include the following:

A.  Most significantly, the IOB report accepts at face value the US relationship with the
Guatemalan military and intelligence services.

The IOB discounts any inconsistency between the US goals to promote human rights and
democracy and the United States' close association with the Guatemalan military and funding of
the Guatemalan intelligence services.  The report simply echoes stated US policy goals, declares
that these were successful and declares that any negative aspect of association with the
Guatemalan intelligence services were outweighed by the positive benefits of intelligence received. 
However, we are given absolutely no indication of how the IOB arrived at these conclusions or
indeed if it made any systematic evaluation of US policy goals at all.

This is the real story.  Not who told who what when, but why the US government should be
associated with and funding Guatemalan institutions deeply implicated in gross human rights
violations.  What possible motives could justify this association?  

To those interested in exploring this association, this report, and very likely some of  the
declassified documents that accompany it, offer interesting and disturbing reading.

B.  The IOB report offers extremely inconclusive evidence on most cases.

The lack of conclusiveness on so many cases brings up several questions.  Did the IOB not have
access to all available evidence?  If it did have access to all available evidence, then clearly, not
only are our intelligence agencies "not all-knowing," but they did not seem very informed at all on
many important issues.   What was the point of such extensive paid assets if they could not
provide information about cases involving US citizens?  

The complete lack of information on Dianna Ortiz's case, pending the Justice Department's
investigation, is disappointing, as is the IOB's lack of information on the man with a US accent
that she identified as being present at her torture.

C.  The IOB report presents very limited recommendations.

The IOB recommendations are perhaps its weakest point, calling for fairly minor changes in CIA
guidance and State Department-CIA agreements; some of these changes have already been made
by the new CIA director.

The reliance on guidance and other non-legislative measures seems ingenuous, given the contents
of the report.  The Board recommends only that the CIA issue clear guidance on the recruitment
and retention of assets with human rights or criminal allegations..  Most of the other
recommendations also involve changes in guidance and procedures, rather than changes in
legislation.  Yet the report itself judges the CIA less severely because it is only following guidance
or regulations.  CIA officials cannot be held criminally liable for any of the dubious actions within
the report precisely because there is at best guidance, not legislation.  Moreover, the report itself
details how the CIA interpreted guidance and regulations in the most flexible way possible.   The
implications of the report, and the Oversight Board's relatively gentle treatment of the CIA, is
that legislation is essential to begin to hold the CIA and other agencies accountable to human
rights standards.

  One additional point:

 What we have learned to date from the IOB report and declassified documents, while
incomplete, still has advanced our knowledge of US policy and victims' fates.   We welcome
the Clinton Administration's efforts, even if limited and belated, to make information
public.     Yet none of this would have been possible without public and congressional
pressure.  The limited truth that comes to us today is due to the bravery and persistence of
victims and survivors like Dianna Ortiz and Jennifer Harbury and other members of
Coalition Missing; to the support they found among concerned members of the U.S. public;
to persistent advocates within Congress, such as Rep. John Porter, Rep. Constance
Morella, Senator Christopher Dodd and Rep. Robert Torricelli; and to the investigative
journalists who began to push the story farther.  Ongoing public and journalistic interest
will help us learn the truth.

Subject: Use this "initial thoughts on IOB r
Date: 01 Jul 1996 07:14:51 -0800 (PST)

Latin America Legislative Hotline, 1 July 1996


On Friday, June 28, the President's advisory Intelligence Oversight Board
released the public version of its report on Guatemala, fruits of a more than
year-long investigation.  Some U.S. government documents were declassified
at the same time, adding to the State Department documents declassified in
May.  The following are some first thoughts on the implications of this
report.     The public report in its entirety may be found on the home page of
the Center for International Policy.

Some initial thoughts on the Intelligence Oversight Board report on Guatemala

This does not evaluate the IOB's treatment of specific cases, which is being
looked at carefully by victims and relatives.  Nor does it assess the documents
just declassified, which we have yet to review.    These are some more general
thoughts as we all begin to evaluate the report.

I.   While the Intelligence Oversight Board's report on Guatemala is
disappointing in its inconclusiveness and, especially, its failure to evaluate
appropriately overall U.S. policy in supporting the Guatemalan military and
intelligence services,  there are a number of recognitions and conclusions
within the report that should be emphasized.  These include the following:

A.  CIA assets were credibly alleged to be involved in serious human rights
abuses, and the CIA knew this.

"In the course of our review, we found that several CIA assets were credibly
alleged to have ordered, planned, or participated in serious human rights
violations such as assassinations,extrajudicial execution, torture, or kidnapping
while they were assets--and that the CIA's Directorate of Operations (DO)
headquarters was aware at the time of the allegations." (p. 3) 

The asset validation system did not address human rights allegations.  "This
validation system, even if it had been functioning as intended, would not have
highlighted human rights issues because it had been designed to focus almost
exclusively upon assets' vulnerability to counterintelligence and upon dropping
non-producing assets from the payroll."

Only in September 1994 did the CIA conduct a review of its assets throughout
Latin America to determine if any may have violated human rights.  We have
no way of knowing how thorough this review was.  Only in February 1996,
"largely as a result of the inquiries related to Guatemala," (p. 4), did the CIA
issue guidance for dealing with serious human rights violations or crimes of
violence by assets and liaison services.

B.  The CIA failed to inform relevant administration officials and Congress:

"Although National Security Council officials and State Department officials at
the embassy and in Washington were generally aware of the CIA's activities
and liaison relationships in Guatemala, The CIA did not inform these officials
until the end of 1994 and early 1995 that any of its assets or contacts were
alleged to have committed human rights abuses.  These policy officials were
thus denied information relevant to their decision-making and lost any
opportunity to express possible concerns that such asset relationships
undermined US policy on human rights." (p. 25)

"The IOB found the CIA's performance in notifying Congress to have been
inadequate.  Specifically, the IOB concluded that the CIA leadership violated
its statutory obligation to keep the Congressional oversight committees  fully
and currently informed' under Section 413 of Title 50 of the US Code. 
Though this statute is not criminal and the standard is too broad to be
fulfilled to the letter, CIA officers, particularly senior leaders at CIA
headquarters, were derelict in failing to provide information they should have
provided under even the narrowest reading of the statute."  (p. 26) The IOB
credits this failure to inform Congress to the absence of a systematic
notification process and inadequate emphasis on the part of CIA leadership.

C.  The CIA station in Guatemala was not a rogue station.  

The IOB determined that the CIA station was not a rogue station, rather, "it
generally kept the DO headquarters well-informed of developments, negative
or otherwise, including allegations implicating CIA assets as each allegation
surfaced."  (p. 4)  Therefore, the CIA station's actions within Guatemala can be
viewed as approved CIA policy and CIA policy judged accordingly.

D.  US policymakers knew of the "unsavory reputation" of the Guatemalan
intelligence service D-2 and the Department of Presidential Security (known as
the "Archivos"), and also knew of the CIA's liaison with these services.

Not only was the Guatemala station not a rogue station, but the CIA was not a
rogue agency.  This liaison relationship with institutions that systematically
violated human rights was known by US policy makers and should be judged
as part of US policy.  

E.  The funds the CIA provided to the Guatemalan liaison services were vital
to the D-2 and Archivos.  Relevant US policymakers knew that such funding
flowed.

"The funds the CIA provided to the Guatemalan liaison services were vital to
the D-2 and Archivos.  This funding was seen as necessary to make these
services more capable partners with the station, particularly in pursuing
anti-communist and counternarcotics objectives.  The CIA, with the
knowledge of ambassadors and other State Department and National Security
Council officials, as well as the Congress, continued this aid after the
termination of overt military assistance in 1990." (p. 20)

This is one of the most significant revelations within the IOB report, although
it simply reconfirms publicly what has been long known.  Despite knowing of
the Archivos' and D-2's reputations, and without acknowledging it to the U.S.
public, the State Department and the U.S. Congress allowed funding to the
D-2 and (presumably) Archivos, not simply to pay assets to provide
information,
but specifically to strengthen these services' capacity.    The IOB does not
make the connection regarding what effect such support would have on US
policy goals to promote human rights and democracy.   Nor is there discussion
of the dilemmas of counternarcotics efforts done in conjunction with a military
some of whose members were/are involved in drug trafficking.

Unclear exactly who in Congress was informed of what; was it just the
intelligence committees?

In the meantime, the U.S. public was simply informed that U.S. military aid had
halted in 1990.

F.  The CIA consistently underemphasized human rights abuses by the
Guatemalan military and endeavored to put a positive spin in its human rights
reports to Congress.

From 1989 to 1994, the CIA was required to provide semi-annual reports to
Congress on how Programs in Guatemala had been used "to further the
objective of greater respect for human rights And what specific action will be
taken in the ensuing period to further that objective."  The CIA's reports "did
not include information in the possession of the CIA concerning significant
allegations of human rights abuses by the D-2 and Archivos.  The omission of
some of this INformation in reports that repeatedly referred to the security
services' roles in protecting human rights painted an incomplete picture of the
Guatemalan security services." (p. 31)

In briefings of congressional oversight committees, CIA briefers also failed to
provide some clearly relevant information.

G.  The IOB investigation turned up evidence, which was notified to Congress
(but not to the public), that the Department of Defense had found that the
School of the Americas and Southern Command used instructional materials in
training Latin American officers, including Guatemalans, from 1982-91, that
appeared to condone practices such as executions of guerrillas, extortion,
physical abuse, coercion, and false imprisonment (p. 32).

This is a very significant finding.  These instructional materials were used
throughout nearly the entire Reagan and Bush administrations, only being
replaced towards the very end of the Bush Administration.  Moreover, these
training materials were used considerably after the scandal created by the 
similar "CIA training manual for the contras" which was discovered and
publicized  in the mid-80s and stirred considerable public outrage.

This adds one more argument to the case to close the School of the Americas. 
Proponents of the School deny anything unsavory has been taught at the school
and discount graduates who commit human rights abuses as "a few bad
apples."  

H.  Cold War attitudes prevailed among CIA officers dealing with Guatemala,
despite the ending of the Cold War.

"The end of the Cold War gradually led to lower funding levels for the station,
but had only a limited effect upon the mechanics of how the CIA carried out its
business and upon the mind-set of the CIA officers dealing with Guatemala. 
Station officers continued to view the communist insurgents--who seemed to
threaten a more democratic government--as the primary enemy, and they
viewed the Guatemalan government and security services as partners in the
fight against this
common foe and against new threats such as narcotics and illegal alien
smuggling." (p. 20)

I.  The CIA station and U.S. embassy in Guatemala requested assistance from
the D-2, because it was perceived as the most "elite" element of the
Guatemalan military and government.

"Because the D-2 was widely considered to be the elite within the Guatemalan
military and government, the station also often requested and received
administrative and logistical assistance from the D-2 on behalf of the embassy." 
(p. 20)  The IOB quotes this approvingly as having helped U.S. goals in
combating narcotics, combating communist insurgents and rescuing an
American girl kidnapped in 1994.  However, we have to strongly question
what the effect such apparently direct appeals to one of the worst units of the
Guatemalan military by U.S. officials would  have on the enormous problem of
lack of civilian control over the Guatemalan military.

J.  Intelligence regarding cases was inadequately shared with families and
victims.  "The Freedom of Information Act establishes the only legal
requirement to provide such
information, yet that process is often an unsatisfactory way through which to
communicate the information to the families and victims."   (p. 8)  The IOB
found that the administration should provide families and victims with
assessments of the reliability of the intelligence reports on their cases, and
should provide more information than it has in the past, whenever possible. 
The IOB identified a number of cases where intelligence reports with relevant
information were not shared with victims or families, or were shared only after
much delay.  For example, despite Jennifer Harbury's repeated requests since
early 1993, the State Department did not request a search of past intelligence
on the case until October 1994.  In the Blake case, the National Security
Agency made an inadequate search of its database and provided the family with
only 6 of 22 documents available.


II.  In a number of areas, the Intelligence Oversight Board, in part responding
to its limited mandate, did not provide a sufficiently in-depth and independent
analysis.  These would include the following:

A.  Most significantly, the IOB report accepts at face value the US relationship
with the Guatemalan military and intelligence services.

The IOB discounts any inconsistency between the US goals to promote human
rights and democracy and the United States' close association with the
Guatemalan military and funding of  the Guatemalan intelligence services.  The
report simply echoes stated US policy goals, declares that these were
successful and declares that any negative aspect of association with the
Guatemalan intelligence services were outweighed by the positive benefits of
intelligence received.  However, we are given absolutely no indication of how
the IOB arrived at these conclusions or indeed if it made any systematic
evaluation of US policy goals at all.

This is the real story.  Not who told who what when, but why the US
government should be associated with and funding Guatemalan instiutions
deeply implicated in gross human rights violations.  What possible motives
could justify this association?  

To those interested in exploring this association, this report, and very likely
some of  the declassified documents that accompany it, offer interesting and
disturbing reading.

B.  The IOB report offers extremely inconclusive evidence on most cases.

The lack of conclusiveness on so many cases brings up several questions.  Did
the IOB not have access to all available evidence?  If it did have access to all
available evidence, then clearly, not only are our intelligence agencies "not
all-knowing," but they did not seem very informed at all on many important
issues.   What was the point of such extensive paid assets if they could not
provide information about cases involving US citizens?  

The complete lack of information on Dianna Ortiz's case, pending the Justice
Department's investigation, is disappointing, as is the IOB's lack of information
on the man with a US accent that she identified as being present at her torture.

C.  The IOB report presents very limited recommendations.

The IOB recommendations are perhaps its weakest point, calling for fairly
minor changes in CIA guidance and State Department-CIA agreements; some
of these changes have already been made by the new CIA director.

The reliance on guidance and other non-legislative measures seems ingenuous,
given the contents of the report.  The Board recommends only that the CIA
issue clear guidance on the recruitment and retention of assets with human
rights or criminal allegations..  Most of the other recommendations also
involve changes in guidance and procedures, rather than changes in
legislation.  Yet the report itself judges the CIA less severely because it is only
following guidance or regulations.  CIA officials cannot be held criminally
liable for any of the dubious actions within the report precisely because there is
at best guidance, not legislation.  Moreover, the report itself details how the
CIA interpreted guidance and regulations in the most flexible way possible.  
The implications of the report, and the Oversight Board's relatively gentle
treatment of the CIA, is that legislation is essential to begin to hold the CIA
and other agencies accountable to human rights standards.

  One additional point:

 What we have learned to date from the IOB report and declassified
documents, while incomplete, still has advanced our knowledge of US policy
and victims' fates.   We welcome the Clinton Administration's efforts, even if
limited and belated, to make information public.     Yet none of this would have
been possible without public and congressional pressure.  The limited truth that
comes to us today is due to the bravery and persistence of victims and
survivors like Dianna Ortiz and Jennifer Harbury and other members of
Coalition Missing; to the support they found among concerned members of the
U.S. public; to persistent advocates within Congress, such as Rep. John Porter,
Rep. Constance Morella, Senator Christopher Dodd and Rep. Robert
Torricelli; and to the investigative journalists who began to push the story
farther.  Ongoing public and journalistic interest will help us learn the truth.

                        ACTION ALERT
May 27, 1996
As of this writing the impasse between the Zapatista Army of
National Liberation (EZLN) and the Mexican government
remains unresolved.  The recent sentence of two "alleged"
members of the EZLN to long prison terms with no significant
evidence against them and a complete lack of due process has
caused the EZLN to declare the "impossibility" of a
continuance of the peace talks.
Because these political prisoners are literally hostages of
the peace process the National Commission for Democracy, USA
has declared the need for a national campaign for their
liberation. Until such liberation occurs, the Mexican
government will continue to utilize them to extort
concessions at the negotiating table and/or use their
imprisonment against accountability to any agreements.  The
EZLN has also called upon the Mexican government to take
some definitive action against the para-military groups and
"death" squads which are openly operating in the state of
Chiapas.
The present impasse in combination with a widespread famine
due to the inability of indigenous communities to lay in
crops, present the same crisis as existed in February 9th of
1995, and December of 1994.
We therefore call upon all interested individuals and
organizations to aid us in increasing international pressure
upon the Mexican government by collaborating with us in a
Campaign for the Liberation of the Political Prisoners.
Although there exists some possibility the impasse may be
resolved this week, it is our belief that an international
campaign calling for the freedom of these prisoners has
become a primordial need.  We therefore will carry out this
Campaign regardless of the outcome of this present crisis.
The campaign for the Liberation of these prisoners consists
of the following;
     1) We ask all concerned individuals to initiate the
campaign with a simultaneous
      press conference to be held June 3-5th.  A history of
the irregularities contained
      in their imprisonment can be obtained through the
National Center for Democracy, Liberty and Justice at this
address.

     2)  A letter-writing campaign to Warren Christopher at
the State Department will     be conducted throughout the
period of June 5 through July 1.  We call upon    people to
hold educationals about this issue and to otherwise
publicize in any way     possible the lack of human rights
in Mexico.  A sample of the letter to Christopher      is
included with this alert.  Please call upon prominent
national and local leaders    to add their voices to this
petition in order to demonstrate the concern for a continued
peace process.

     3)  The campaign will end on July 1 by culminating in a
    National Day of Reflection and Prayer.  We call upon
                    Churches, individuals
           committed to peace, and community leaders to
                participate in this Day in a
public demonstration of
     support for the liberation of these prisoners
and the end to paramilitary operations in Chiapas.

  Please contact the National Center for Democracy,
Liberty and Justice for
further information.  We hope you share our great
hope
for peace in Mexico and we urge you to do whatever you
can to demonstrate this hope by your participation in
this campaign.

Subject: update: another prisoner sentenced
Date: 28 May 1996 16:06:18


Update

     Recent news from Mexico indicates that Mexico's State
Department remains intransigent towards the EZLN.
Negotiator Marco Antonio Bernal stated today that:
     1) the federal gov't is not considering any "violent"
action
     2) the sentencing of the prisoners proceeds and the law
which governs the   peace is not a "straightjacket"
     3)the EZLN should bring any issues to the negotiating
table on June 5th or
     re-set a date.

     Meanwhile, in Veracruz, Francisco Garcia Santiago, a
presumed Zapatista, was found guilty and sentenced to 7
years in jail and a fine of $15,000 pesos.  Santiago was
sentenced based upon a confession obtained from him after
members of his family had been kidnapped by state police and
threats to their safety were used to obtain his confession.
He was sentenced for the sabotage of an electrical tower in
Veracruz.

-------------- Enclosure number 1 ----------------
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher
2201 C. St. NW
Washington, D.C.  20520



Dear Sir,

     We, the undersigned wish to express a high level of concern
about the growing crisis in Mexico and the real possibility of
the outbreak of hostilities once again in the southeast state of
Chiapas.  The growing evidence of human rights violations, links
to drug trafficking on a high governmental level, and the
continued impunity of paramilitary groups, have provoked a
massive exodus of families seeking relief from the political and
economic crisis.
     Because Mexico is our closest neighbor in Latin America we
cannot remain silent before the consequences of this crisis.  We
therefore request the response of the State Department in terms
of the following issues;

      1) We understand that Mexico is receiving substantial
military equipment  from the United States.  Although the
objective of these sales is said to be aid in the drug war, we
request information about the guarantees which exist that this
equipment will not be used for other purposes such as
counterinsurgency  and government responses to civil unrest.
This equipment includes the recent sale of 73 Huey helicopters.
We are also interested in clearly understanding the current
working relationships to both train the Mexican military and
replace any weapons ten years or older for the Mexican Army.
     2) We request any current information on the state of
human
rights in Mexico.  Specifically we need to know current
governmental responses to paramilitary groups and/or "deaths
quads", and to the protection of the human rights of the 18
individuals presently jailed under accusation of being members
of the rebel group in Chiapas, the Zapatistas.
     3)  We request any information which the State Department
may have about the possible breakdown of the peace talks in
Chiapas, Mexico.

     We strongly affirm our commitment to a peaceful solution
and a transition to democracy for Mexico.  We do not believe
that our southern border can bear the economic and humanitarian
brunt of a growing and debilitating political and economic
crisis in Mexico. We urge your prompt response and look forward
to policies which strengthen the possibilities for peace in
Mexico.  Thank you for your attention.

Respectfully,




.

In the June 1 edition of La Jornada on page 16 there was an
article that included news on Oventic.  According to CONPAZ,
the residents of Oventic, in the municipality of San Andres
Larrainzar, abandoned their community on Friday, May 31st,
"because of the strong presence of the Army and the
insecurity of the region".  CONPAZ stated that the community
was "deserted" and the homes "abandoned".

A CAUTIONARY TALE: 
Failed U.S. Development Policy in Central America

by Michael Conroy, Douglas Murray and Peter Rosset 
May, 1996, Food First Development Studies, 
Lynne Rienner Publishers ISBN 1-55587-630-7


Neither structural adjustment policies, nor 
industrialization, nor traditional agricultural exports 
have led to sustained economic growth and social equity 
in Central America. Seeking to reinvigorate the region's 
struggling economies, U.S. AID -- supported by the World 
Bank and the IMF -- designed a new development policy, 
one based on nontraditional agricultural exports. Crops 
ranging from passion fruit and broccoli to macadamia 
nuts and melons, have been vigorously promoted through 
massive foreign aid and fierce pressure on local 
governments. 

This book dissects the varied impacts of a decade of 
this central AID policy -- impacts on the environment, 
on the livelihoods of thousands of small farmers, and on 
the sovereignty of elected governments. An anatomy of 
failure, of a policy gamble run amuck -- the book is a 
cautionary tale that is must reading for scholars, 
practitioners, policymakers and students of 
international development, economic globalization and 
U.S. foreign policy.

Convocatoria a la Jornada Mundial en Apoyo al "Dialogo de
San Andres".

El "Dialogo de San Andres", por la paz con justicia y
dignidad,
este en peligro. El gobierno mexicano ha dado claras senales
de su
intencion de romperlo, para asi justificar una salida
militar. La carencia
de propuestas y el bajo perfil de la delegacion
gubernamental a lo largo
de la Mesa 2 dedicada al tema "Democracia y Justicia", las
condenas a
Javier Elorriaga y Sebastian Entzin, presuntos zapatistas,
por los cargos
de terrorismo, la ambigiedad del poder ejecutivo al plantear
la forma de
revertir dichas condenas y la informacion calumniosa que
filtra el
gobierno a ciertos periodistas encargados de difamar la
causa de los
presuntos zapatistas, son prueba del intencional sabotaje
gubernamental al
proceso de paz. Las constantes y cada vez mas agresivas
incursiones
militares, la compra de equipos belicos y la proteccion a
los grupos
paramilitares que actuan en el estado de Chiapas, confirman
la intencion
del gobierno mexicano de justificar el reinicio de los
enfrentamientos
militares. Mientras la guerra de baja intensidad pasa a una
nueva etapa,
el gobierno mexicano ha lanzado un ultimatum diciendo que si
el EZLN no
acude a las negociaciones el proximo cinco de junio
reanudara la
persecucion judicial contra los zapatistas, lo cual
significaria de hecho
reaunudar la guerra.

Frente a esta grave situacion, el Ejercito Zapatista de
Liberacion
Nacional, ha declarado enfaticamente que, al no existir
condiciones
politicas minimas es imposible la continuacion del dialogo.
Por ello, ha
manifestado a la sociedad civil que si piensa hacer algo
para impedir la
solucion militar: a debe hacerlo ya!, exigiendo al gobierno
mexicano tomar
en serio el "Dialogo de San Andres".

Ante este momento crucial, entre la guerra y la paz,
Asesores e
Invitados del EZLN en el "Dialogo de San Andres" convocan a
los ciudadanos
del mundo, partidarios de una salida pacifica, justa y digna
de la guerra
en Chiapas, a realizar la 1a Jornada Mundial en apoyo al
"Dialogo de San
Andres", para exigir al gobierno crear las condiciones
necesarias para
alcanzar la paz. La Jornada se iniciara el proximo sabado 8
de junio
y continuara durante toda esa semana. Consistira en
movilizaciones simultaneas
frente a las embajadas y consulados mexicanos en todo el
mundo y en
multiples movilizaciones en Mexico. Comprendera ademas del
envio
de cartas al Presidente Ernesto Zedillo, 271-1764 (Fax) y
al Secretario de la Defensa Nacional, General Enrique
Cervantes. 395-2935
(Fax). Las principales demandas de esta Jornada seran:

 - El retiro de las tropas del ejercito mexicano a sus
cuarteles, en
cumplimiento del articulo 129 de la Constitucion mexicana,
el cese del
acoso a las comunidades chiapanecas y el envio de alimentos
a las
poblaciones ubicadas en la zona de conflicto, ya que el
acoso militar les
impidio sembrar.
- Retirar, por improcedentes los cargos de terrorismo Javier
Elorriaga y
Sebastian Entzin, y en consecuencia liberarlos de la carcel,
lo mismo que
a los otros 16 presuntos zapatistas presos.
- El reinicio de las platicas de paz, con una clara y
demostrable
decision de resolver los problemas que dieron origen al
levantamiento del
1o de enero de 1994.

Como simbolo de la Jornada proponemos soltar pequenos
"globos
aerostaticos" con un mensaje al EZLN que diga "No estan
solos", evocando
los globos enviados al mundo por los comuneros de Paris para
llamar a
defender la esperanza.

     Mucho agracederemos su participacion en estas Jornadas,
por la
vida y en contra de los actos guerreros del gobierno
mexicano.

     Ciudad de Mexico, a 23 de mayo de 1996.


     ASESORES E INVITADOS DEL EJERCITO ZAPATISTA DE
LIBERACION NACIONAL EN EL DIALOGO DE SAN ANDRES.
-------------------------------

          Call to action

International Week of Support for the San Andres Peace Talks
in Mexico

The San Andres Peace Talks for peace with justice and
dignity are in danger
of breaking down.  The Mexican government has clearly shown
its intention to
subvert the Peace Talks and to impose a military 'solution'
on the Zapatistas.

The Mexican government has not acted in good faith during
the second round
of Peace Talks on Democracy and Justice.  It has lacked
proposals for the Round
Table discussions, and the official government delegation is
composed of low
level bureaucrats who lack authority to negotiate in the
discussions.
Furthermore, even as it pretends to negotiate issues of
democracy and justice,
the Mexican government has arrested and condemned two
supposed Zapatistas -
Javier Elorriaga and Sebastian Entzin - to 14 years of jail
for unsubstantiated
charges of terrorism.  Both executive indecision on
reviewing this case and
leaks of slanderous information on the case from the
government to some
journalists who spread disinformation about the Elorriaga
and Entzin case are
part of an intentional government campaign to delegitimize
the Zapatistas'
position.

Menacing signs of the Mexican government's intention to
renew military
confrontation abound; constant and increasingly aggressive
military incursions
in Chiapas, purchase of military hardware, and the
protection of paramilitary
groups active in Chiapas.  While the low intensity warfare
reaches new levels of
activity, the Mexican government has imposed an ultimatum on
the Zapatistas.  If
the EZLN does not respond to government demands by June 5,
it will resume
judicial persecution of all presumed Zapatistas.  This is a
clear sign of the
Mexican government's transgression of the Peace Process and
a resumption of
a state of war.

In front of this serious situation, the Zapatista Army of
National Liberation
has declared that without even a minimal political will on
the part of the
government, it is impossible to continue a dialogue.  The
EZLN has told civil
society that if we want to do something to impede a military
solution - WE
MUST DO IT NOW!  We, civil society, must demand that the
government get serious about the San Andres Peace Talks.

At this crucial moment, between war and peace, the Advisors
and Observers for
the EZLN in the San Andres Peace Talks call all the citizens
of the world
interested in a peaceful, just and dignified solution to the
war in Chiapas, to
participate in and promote a Week of Support for the San
Andres Peace
Talks to pressure the Mexican government to create the
conditions necessary to reach a negotiated peace.

The Week of Support will begin Saturday, June 8, with
simultaneous
demonstrations for peace in front of Mexican embassies and
consulates through out the world, and with many
demonstrations throughout Mexico.  It will include sending
letters to:
     President Ernesto Zedillo     fax: (525)  271- 1764
     General Enrique Cervantes, Minister of National
Defense, (525)395-2935.

The principal demands of this week of Support are:
1. Withdrawal of Mexican army troops from Chiapas
communities and the retreat of Mexican army troops into
their barracks in fulfillment of Article 129 of the
Mexican Constitution.
2. Cessation of military harassment of Chiapas communities
and the delivery
of food and grains to the people living in the zone of
conflict; military action in
the area restricted farmers and peasants from planting their
subsistence crops
for the year.
3. Withdraw the unsubstantiated charges of terrorism against
Javier Elorriaga
and Sebastian Entzin, and free them from jail along with the
other 16 political
prisoners.
4. Reestablish the Peace Talks, with a clear and
demonstrable will to resolve
the problems that are at the root of the uprising of January
1, 1994.

As a symbol of the Week of Support, we propose that
participants launch
balloons in the air with the message to the EZLN saying "You
are NOT alone".  This action is reminiscent of the balloons
sent into the world by the members of the
communes of Paris in a call to defend their hope for a
better future.

Many thanks for your participation in the Week of Support,
in support of
life and against acts of war of the Mexican government.

Mexico City,

Group of Advisors and Observers of the EZLN in the San
Andres Peace Talks

Aufruf zur Internationalen Aktion zur Unterstuetzung des
"San Andres Dialog=
es"

Der "San Andres Dialog", das Dialog fuer einen wuerdigen und
gerechten
Frieden in Chiapas ist gerade in grosser Gefahr. Die
mexikanische
Regierung hat klare Zeichenge geben, den Dialog abzubrechen,
um eine
militarische Intervention gerechtfertigen zu koen nen. Die
mangelden
Vorschlaege und das niedrige Niveau der Regierungsdelegation
in der 2.
Verhandlungsphase (zum Thema "Demokratie und Gerechtigkeit")
der
Friedensgesprechaer; die Gerichtlicheverurteilungen von
Javier Elorriaga
und Sebastian Entzin, angeb liche Zapatisten, unter dem
Vorwurf des
Terrorismus; die unklare Stellungnahme der Exekutive zu
einer moeglichen
Ruecknahme der Verurteilung und die verleumderische
Berichterstattung
ueber den Fall in der mexikanischen Presse, beweisen die
intentionierte
Sabotagehaltung verschiedener Kreise gegen den
Friedensprozess. Die
staendigen und immer aggressiveren militaerischen Eingriffe,
die
Anschaffung neuer kriegerischen Ausruestung und der Schutz
der
paramilitaerische Gruppen der Region, belegen die Absicht
der
mexikanischen Regierung, erneute militaerische Aktionen
rechtfertigen zu
wollen. Waehrend der low-intensity Krieg auf einer hoeheren
Stufe angeland
ist, hat die mexikanische Regierung gleichzeitig das
Ultimatum gestellt,
dass wenn den Vertreter des Za patistischen Heeres sich
nicht zu den
Verhandlungen am 5. Juli einfinden,werden die gerichtlichen
Verfolgung
gegen die Zapatisten weitergehen. Das wuerde die
Wiederaufnahme des
Krieges bedeuten.=20

Angesichts dieser schweren Lage, hat die Zapatisten hat
nachdruecklich
erklaert dass, dass der Dialog nicht fortgesetzt werden
kann, solange wenn
die politischen Bedingungen nicht gegeben sind. Deswegen hat
das Ezln
ge=E4usert dass, wenn die politisch int eressierte
Gesellschaft etwas
unternehmen will, um die militarische Loesung zu verhindern,
muss sie das
jetzt tun, und um die mexikanische Regierung zu dr=E4ngen,
den Dialog Ernst
zu nehmen.=20

In dieser Situation zwischen Krieg und Frieden, rufen die
Berater und
Gaeste des EZLN im "San Andres Dialog" den Teil der
Weltbevoelkerung, ,
der eine friedige, gerechtige und wuerdige Loesung in
Chiapas
befuerwortet, dazu auf, die Internationalen Aktione n in
Unterstuetzung
zum "Dialogo de San Andres" zu organisieren. Diese Aktion
begint am 8.
Juni, mit Demonstrationen vor den mexikanischen Botschaften
und Konsulaten
in aller Welt und gleichzeitig verschiedenen Demostrationen
in Mexiko. Es
ist sehr wichti g, dass ihr Briefaktionen an den Presidenten
Ernesto
Zedillo (fax 271-1764) und des Verteidigungsminister General
Enrique
Cervantes (fax 395-2935)startet. Unsere wichtigsten
Forderungen sind:=20

- Der Rucksueck der Mexikanischen Armee in ihre Kassernen,
gemaess Artikel
129 des mexikanischen Grundgesetzes; schluss mit der
Belaestigung der
Bevoelkerung von Chiapas; die Sendung von Naehrungsmitteln
zur fuer die
Zivilbevoelkerung in der Konfliktzone,
 in der aufgrund der militaerischen Besetzung nicht geset
werden konnte.=20
- Das Zuruecknahme der Gerichtlichenanklage des Terrorismus,
und die
Freilassung Javier Elorreagas und Sebastian Entzins, und
aller anderen 16
angeblichen Zapatististen.=20
- Das Wiederaufnahme der Friedensverhandlungen,
und einer klaren und glauwuerdige Entscheidung der Regierung
die Probleme,
die den Konflikt hevorgerufen haben, zu loesen.=20

Als Symbol der Aktion, schlagen wir vor, kleine Luftballons,
mit der
Aufschrift "Ihr seid nicht allein", fliegenzulassen (im
Gedaechtins an die
Pariser Kommune und deren Aufruf die Hoffnung nicht zu
verlieren)

Wir bedanken uns herztlich fuer eure Teilnahme an dieser
Aktion fuer das
Leben und gegen den kriegerischen Umtriebe der Regierung.=20

Dear Sir,

     We, the undersigned wish to express a high level of concern
about the growing crisis in Mexico and the real possibility of
the outbreak of hostilities once again in the southeast state of
Chiapas.  The growing evidence of human rights violations, links
to drug trafficking on a high governmental level, and the
continued impunity of paramilitary groups, have provoked a
massive exodus of families seeking relief from the political and
economic crisis.
     Because Mexico is our closest neighbor in Latin America we
cannot remain silent before the consequences of this crisis.  We
therefore request the response of the State Department in terms
of the following issues;

      1) We understand that Mexico is receiving substantial
military equipment  from the United States.  Although the
objective of these sales is said to be aid in the drug war, we
request information about the guarantees which exist that this
equipment will not be used for other purposes such as
counterinsurgency  and government responses to civil unrest.
This equipment includes the recent sale of 73 Huey helicopters.
We are also interested in clearly understanding the current
working relationships to both train the Mexican military and
replace any weapons ten years or older for the Mexican Army.
     2) We request any current information on the state of
human
rights in Mexico.  Specifically we need to know current
governmental responses to paramilitary groups and/or "deaths
quads", and to the protection of the human rights of the 18
individuals presently jailed under accusation of being members
of the rebel group in Chiapas, the Zapatistas.
     3)  We request any information which the State Department
may have about the possible breakdown of the peace talks in
Chiapas, Mexico.

     We strongly affirm our commitment to a peaceful solution
and a transition to democracy for Mexico.  We do not believe
that our southern border can bear the economic and humanitarian
brunt of a growing and debilitating political and economic
crisis in Mexico. We urge your prompt response and look forward
to policies which strengthen the possibilities for peace in
Mexico.  Thank you for your attention.

Respectfully,




.

A CAUTIONARY TALE: 
Failed U.S. Development Policy in Central America

by Michael Conroy, Douglas Murray and Peter Rosset 
May, 1996, Food First Development Studies, 
Lynne Rienner Publishers ISBN 1-55587-630-7


Neither structural adjustment policies, nor 
industrialization, nor traditional agricultural exports 
have led to sustained economic growth and social equity 
in Central America. Seeking to reinvigorate the region's 
struggling economies, U.S. AID -- supported by the World 
Bank and the IMF -- designed a new development policy, 
one based on nontraditional agricultural exports. Crops 
ranging from passion fruit and broccoli to macadamia 
nuts and melons, have been vigorously promoted through 
massive foreign aid and fierce pressure on local 
governments. 

This book dissects the varied impacts of a decade of 
this central AID policy -- impacts on the environment, 
on the livelihoods of thousands of small farmers, and on 
the sovereignty of elected governments. An anatomy of 
failure, of a policy gamble run amuck -- the book is a 
cautionary tale that is must reading for scholars, 
practitioners, policymakers and students of 
international development, economic globalization and 
U.S. foreign policy.

Two alleged Mexican rebels freed on appeal

     TUXTLA GUTIERREZ- A judge acting of an appeal freed two
alleged Zapatista rebels from jail Thursday, opening the way
for stalled peace talks between the guerrillas and the
government to resume.
     Superior Court Judge Enrique Duran quashed the long
jail sentences for terrorism and rebellion imposed by a
lower court and set the men free, Uriel Jarguin, under-
secretary for government in the southern state of Chiapas,
told Reuters.
     The alleged rebels, Javier Elorriaga and Sebastian
Entzin, were sentenced May 2 to jail terms of 13 and six
years respectively.
     The appeal judge in the Chiapas state capital of Tuxtla
Gutierrez, 500 miles southeast of Mexico City, upheld a two-
year sentence for arms offenses against Entzin but freed him
of bail because he had already spent 16 months in jail.
     The harshness of the original verdicts, reached on the
basis of a written statement from a witness who never
appeared in court despite six summonses, provoked an angry
reaction from the Zapatista leadership.
     Rebel leader Subcommander Marcos said from his jungle
hideout June 1 that the Zapatistas would not resume stalled
peace talks with the government until the two men were
freed.
     Plans for a fresh round of talks June 5 were put on
hold and newspaper columnists speculated that the rebels
might be forced back into violence unless the tension eased.
     Marcos accused hard-liners in President Zedillo's
administration of provoking confrontation with the rebels,
suggesting they had engineered the court sentences to
undermine the peace negotiations.
     The government insisted that the justice process was
completely independent of the peace process and denied that
either the initial sentence or the freeing on appeal were
the result of any political pressure from Mexico City.
     Elorriaga and Entzin allegedly took part in the
uprising by Mayan Indians in the southern Mexican state of
Chiapas, where Zapatista rebels launched their revolt for
democracy and indigenous rights in January 1994.
     The two men had been in jail since February 1995, when
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo launched a crackdown
against the rebel forces.
     Elorriaga, a television journalist who also had served
as a go-between between Zedillo and the Zapatista guerrilla
leader Subcommandante Marcos, denied ever belonging to the
proscribed guerrilla movement.

*** PEACE BRIGADES INTERNATIONAL ***
CENTRAL AMERICA PROJECT (GUATEMALA) 6/96 REPORT

As was foreseen, the Accord on Socioeconomic Aspects
and the Agrarian Situation was signed on May 6 in
Mexico City, leaving both negotiating parties, as well
as the international community, satisfied.=20

The 39 page document establishes a set of minimal and
basic reforms designed to instill long term changes in
the direction of State Modernisation.  The Accord
revolves around five main points: Democracy and
Participatory Development, Social Development, the
Agrarian Situation and Rural Development,
Modernisation of Public Policy and Fiscal Management,
and Final Arrangements.=20

The Agrarian Situation has provided a focal point in
the negotiation, being one of the main causes of the
escalation of armed conflict and one of the central
themes in Guatemalan politics today.  Amongst the
commitments agreed to by the government, of special
interest is the creation of a land bank which will
begin operation in 1997, as well as the promotion and
publication of a law which monitors the functioning of
it.=20

In 1999, the government will evaluate the functioning


of the project and compare it with its objectives.=20
Another promise was the development of a national land
registration project, in which the government promises
to initiate a survey of land distribution information,
starting in January of 1997.  In the finance
department, one of the more positive points was the
provision of legal reinforcement mechanisms to avoid
tax evasion, which, it is assumed will normalize the
fiscal debt (Inforpress, 9.5.96).  =20

As the penultimate accord of the substantive agenda
was signed, the National Revolutionary Union of
Guatemala (URNG) announced the immediate suspension of
the forced collection of the "war tax" from landowners
and business owners.  An investigation initiated by
the Ombuds Office for Human Rights (PDH) revealed the
existence of evidence proving that the "war tax"
collected by the URNG continues to be demanded in
various plantations in Santa Rosa and Jutiapa.=20

It is still to be determined if they are truly being
carried out by members of the insurgency.  The
president of the governmental Peace Commission
(COPAZ), Gustavo Porras, after contemplating the
situation, declared that those carrying out the
collection of this tax are not in fact members of the
URNG (La Republica, 21.5.96).  =20
Different Sectors, Distinct Reactions  =20

The Assembly of Civil Society, one of the sectors most
directly involved in the negotiation process,
requested the integration of a High Level Commission
to study what was signed.  An even more critical
viewpoint was offered by the National Coordination of
Campesino Organisations (CNOC), which brings together
various organisations which are struggling to obtain
land titles, including CONIC and CUC. =20

While valuing the accord because it provides
possibilities "to resolve in an integral way the
problematic of campesinos", CNOC established that "the
accord is incomplete and insufficient with regards to
concrete mechanisms to resolve land conflicts".  =20

In contrast to the critics, the satisfaction of the
business sector was evident as they were one of the
first to applaud the accord.  The Coordinating
Commission of Agricultural, Commercial, Industrial and
Finance Associations (CACIF) expressed their complete
backing of the accord and made an international call
to all businesses to continue investing in Guatemala.=20
Humberto Pretti, president of CACIF, highlighted the
planning of a national land registration project and
the development of a land bank, claiming that it will
legitimize property owners (Inforpress, 16.5.96).=20

Various political analysts agree that the accord,
deemed a strategic step in the negotiating process,
builds on elements which are already integral parts of
the constitution and the legal framework of the
country, and what it hopes to achieve is "to be not
only an announcement of good intentions but move on to
become the legal base of the capital development of
Guatemala" (El Grafico, 8.6.96).=20

In reality, as many sectors have pointed out, the
accord is based on good intentions, and opens more
political space for the URNG to insert itself into the
political and legal framework of the country.=20
Guerrilla Comandante Gaspar Ilom confirms this when he
says that he is working on "a transition from armed
struggle", adding that the URNG is looking to conform
into a national political project which will transcend
the peace negotiations (Inforpress, 16.5.96).  =20

On May 12th, the Guatemalan daily, Siglo Veintiuno,
reported that Luis Becker, Francisco Villagran, Luz
Mendez and possibly Pedro Palma Lau all retired from
the political-diplomatic team of the URNG, virtually
dissolving the advisor team to the URNG.  The general
command of the URNG have not confirmed nor denied this
information.  The reason for the retirement, according
to the paper, was their discontentment with the way
that the Socioeconomic and Agrarian Reforms were
negotiated.=20

The team leaves the URNG with only one more
substantive theme in the negotiations; Strengthening
Civil Power and the Role of the Army in a Democratic
Society.  =20

Special Delivery from the US: Conflictive Documents =20


During the month of May, Guatemala received more than
6,305 documents which were declassified by the U.S.
State Department regarding human rights violations
against United States citizens during the period
between 1984 and 1995.  The documentation contains
important information regarding, among others cases,
the assassination of United States citizen Michael
Devine by a military patrol in Guatemala's northern
department of El Peten; the kidnapping and subsequent
torture in 1989 of Ursulin nun Diana Ortiz, and the
capture and subsequent assassination of guerrilla
commander Efrain Bamaca.  =20

Of the information contained in the U.S. State
Department files, 8 per cent was not revealed to the
Guatemalan government, including information regarding
CIA involvement in Guatemala, claiming "security
reasons".  For more than forty years, the CIA has been
accused of having strong ties with repressive agents
of the Guatemalan state, which calls into question the
effectiveness of the documentation which has been
sent.=20

According to The New York Times, "documents which were
declassified could help in determining those
responsible for assassinations in Guatemala,
specifically that of guerrilla leader Efrain Bamaca,
known as Comandante Everaldo and that of North
American citizen Michael Devine."  According to the
well-respected daily newspaper, a member of the
Clinton Administration who was not in agreement with
the manner in which the case was handled by the US
government reported that "the Guatemalan Colonel and
CIA agent Roberto Alpirez is responsible for the
Bamaca and Devine assassinations" (Inforpress,
16.5.96).  =20

Upon their arrival to Guatemala, the documents were
brought to the Supreme Court of Justice, which,
corresponding to the penal legislation in effect, had
it sent to the Public Prosecutor's Office, which is in
charge of managing investigations of this sort.=20
The Office refused to open the documents, claiming
they were sent against legal norms (Prensa Libre,
16.5.96).  According to Ronalth Ochaeta, director of
the Archbishop's Human Rights Office (ODHA), the
Public Prosecutor's Office has demonstrated a lack of
goodwill and efficiency in investigating important
cases which extend to different State organisms and
could "burn their hands" with information which could
be very implicating (Prensa Libre, 21.5.96).  =20

Solidarity Tax and Anti-Strike Law  =20

With a majority of National Advance Party (PAN)
deputies and the opposition of the remaining political
parties, Congress approved the establishment of the
Extraordinary and Temporary Solidarity Tax which,
according to government forces, will permit the
strengthening of State structures, diminish the
internal debt and support the political economy in
1996 and 1997.=20

This tax affects all citizens who receive a net annual
income greater than 48,000 quetzales and, according to
the Centre for National Economic Investigations, the
determination of the tax paid on last year's declared
net income penalizes those who have declared their
incomes and paid their taxes, while it will be more
difficult to oblige those who still have not declared
to contribute the extraordinary tax (Siglo Veintiuno,
16.5.96).  =20

At the end of the month, Congress undertook a second
reading of the conflictive reforms to the State
Worker's Strike Regulation and Labour Law.  Part of
the objective of the reforms are to prohibit the right
to strike for a number of health, public sector and
social service workers.  It also aims to restrict
strikes in sectors providing such vital services as
water, transportation, electricity and other
combustibles, and other cases which gravely affect the
national economy and put the health of the population
at risk.=20

The reforms are based in the fact that State Workers
have not respected the Constitution when they have
paralysed essential services such as hospitals and
recently, the justice system.     Since the potential
reform was presented in Congress by a PAN
representative, it has provoked strong opposition on
the part of the majority of labour organisations, as
well as the parliamentary minorities.  During the
beginning of the discussion on this point, PAN
representatives prohibited the entrance of worker
representatives.=20

Representatives then entered by force in to the
Congress Chamber and a confrontation between these
representatives and the National Police or elements of
the Army was anticipated.  In spite of this tension,
the 43 representative PAN block approved the reforms
after almost 11 hours of debate in which the
opposition used all the parliamentary technicalities
possible to impede the reforms from being passed
(Siglo Veintiuno, 24.5.96).  =20

Representatives of the opposition declared the
Guatemalan constitution had been violated with the
military presence in the Legislative Palace and that
the presence constituted a violation of the official
duties of the Executive (Prensa Libre, 24.5.96).  They
expressed their outrage at the fact that it was the
president of the Republic, Alvaro Arz=A3 Irigoyen who
ordered the entrance of the military contingent into
Congress (La Republica, 29.5.96).  =20

TEAMWORK IN THE CAPITAL  =20

We continued with our regular visits and periodic
presences in the offices of popular organisations and
human rights groups in the capital.  We continued to
accompany the workers of the INEXPORT factory, who
continued their presence and labour struggle outside
the illegally closed factory - whose owners refuse to
pay their delayed salaries, and are now threatening to
remove all the machinery from the factory.=20

We also continued to accompany the Association of
Sellers of the Informal Economy in Zone 1 due to the
threats which they have refused for organising. =20

We have maintained a presence with Debora Guzman,
trade union worker form the MJ Modas factory and her
companion Felix Gonzalez  from Amatitl n.  =20

We began daily accompaniment to Blanca Rosa Ayala
Gutierrez, director of the Mirador II settlement in
the capital and leader from the Association of
Squatter Settlements of Guatemala.  Blanca Rosa
suffered an attempted assassination in which she was
shot three times and seriously injured, and is
currently recuperating in a hospital in the capital.=20
 =20

On the streets of the capital  =20
We recently accompanied a march organized by CONAVIGUA
to mark the International Day of Conscientious
Objection and demand the end to militarisation and
forced recruitment.=20

In conjunction with the political revindications
around labour issues, the month has contained a number
of accompaniments of various demonstrations organized
by UASP and other labour organizations which have
taken to the streets to reclaim their right to strike
before the recent approval to the reforms of the
Labour Law Regarding State Worker's Right to Strike.=20
 =20

We also carried out an orientation for the newly
arrived accompaniers from the Spanish Accompaniment
Organisation, Intermon, and saw them off with a dinner
as they left for the community of Aurora 8 of October
in Xaman, Chisec, Alta Verapaz.   =20

We met with Rosalina Tuyuc, director of the National
Coordinating Committee of Guatemalan Widows
(CONAVIGUA) and representative of the FDNG in
Congress.  We gratefully received Monse=A4or Julio
Cabrera, Bishop of the Diocese of Quiche, for an
enjoyable dinner in our home.  =20

IN THE INTERIOR  =20

Izabal: We returned to the communities of Rubelhu and
Rubelpec, in the township of El Estor, who continue to
receive threats and be pressured for their continued
struggle to reclaim their rights.  We also interviewed
Father Daniel Vogt, of the San Pedro Apostal parish,
who has been actively supportive of the communities.=20
=20

Suchitepequez: We travelled to Mazatenango to visit
the director of Radio Victoria, Carlos Orellana, who
was the victim of an assassination attempt when a bomb
exploded in his home.  We also met with the Assistant
in the Regional Ombuds Office for Human Rights (PDH).=20
=20

San Marcos: We again accompanied the lawyers from the
Human Rights Office and Pastoral Team on Land,
conducted appointments with members of the MINUGUA
regional office and the PDH and met with the Union of
State and Popular Sector Workers (UTESP) in the
neighbouring city of San Pedro Sacatepequez.   =20

Quiche: We accompanied the lawyers of CERJ in their
legal work which they continue in Santa Cruz.  In
particular, we accompanied them to a legal function of
"reconstruction of facts" which was carried out in San
Pedro Jocopilas, in an attempt to clarify the details
of an assassinated youth in july of last year.=20
Autodefense patrols as well as an ex-military
commissioner were alleged to be involved.  We also
accompanied members of CONIC on a visit to Lemoa in
Quiche.    =20

AN INTERVIEW WITH ALFONSO BAUER PAIZ:=20
"I HOPE THE POPULAR FORCES CAN REMAIN UNITED"  =20

Born in 1918, one of the activists who fought against
the dictatorship of Ubico, revolutionary of 1944,
holding public positions within the Arevalo and Arbenz
presidencies, twice exiled, and most recently an
esteemed legal advisor of the Guatemalan refugees in
Mexico and the displaced population in general,
Alfonso Bauer Paiz is one of the most well known
political personalities in Guatemala.  =20

>From an historical perspective, a history which you
have personally experienced, what is the greatest
possible advantage offered in the Socio-economic
accord (the most recent accord signed between the
government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary
Unity (URNG) in May of this year) and what is its most
serious disadvantage?=20

The accord did not manage to fulfil the yearnings of
the Guatemalan people, in particular the peasant and
working class. =20

It is positive and legally important that in many of
the precepts of the accord the government acquired
commitments that are tied not only to the current
administration and executive, but to an agent of the
state.  Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the
Congress of the Republic or the Supreme Court of
justice will uphold the accords.  Due to the political
instability of our country it can't be known whether
or not future governments will maintain the
commitments acquired by this administration.=20

However, the latest obligations agreed to by his
government have  consist in the realization of a
series of actions that take in to account the social
needs of the people.  This is the most significant,
and in these commitments one finds some resistance to
the current trends of globalization of the economy and
of neoliberalism.  =20

Now, as for the problematic land issue, the popular
sectors have the impression that very little was
gained.  There are no concrete commitments that attack
the problem of uneven land ownership.  Everything is
made to depend on a land survey that could possibly
take four years to be realized.  Certainly the land
survey could produce valuable information regarding
idle lands, but it will also show that the most
powerful land owners will have their holdings
inscribed in the registry.  And the form in which the
article in the constitution regarding private property
explains land as "inherent to the human personality"
will make expropriations legally difficult. =20

However, one positive note is the mention of a
revision of judgement of the Transversal Fringe of the
North and the Peten.   These lands could be
effectively put to use by awarding them to the peasant
class that have no land.  =20

Finally, I would say that its not possible to
undertake a strong campaign against the accords,
considering the as yet untouched power of the large
land holding class and entrepreneurs organized in the
Coordinating Committee of Agricultural, Commercial,
Industrial and Financial Sectors (CACIF).  There are
some people that would be pleased to see the popular
sectors totally discredit the government and the URNG.=20


The accord should be taken as a first step that
permits a revision of the actual agrarian situation.=20
But something positive will come out of it only if the
peasant population organizes itself, avoiding
divisions and fractures, and struggles in solidarity
with other sectors of the population, such as the
working class, the groups that form the petty
bourgeoisie, intellectuals and professionals to
reclaim its rights.  =20

In the process of the return of Guatemalan refugees,
especially in Mexico, and the resettlement of the
displaced populations in general, there seem to be
many obstacles.  What, essentially, is the problem,
and what possible solutions are there?  =20

In part these obstacles exist because, unfortunately,
there are divisions among the organizations that
represent the refugees, that is, the Permanent
Commission of Guatemalan Refugees in Mexico (CCPP).=20

The accord dealing with the resettlement of the
populations displaced by the internal conflict, signed
on June 27th of 1994, has not been adhered to, with
the exception of the Technical Commission which is in
charge of the diagnostics and profiles of the
projects. =20
The displaced populations - refugees and the
internally displaced - established the Consultative
Assembly of Displaced Populations (ACPD) in September
of 1994, formed by the CCPP, the Communities of
Populations in Resistance (CPR), the National Council
for Displaced Guatemalans (CONDEG), the National
Coordinating Body of Guatemalan Widows (CONAVIGUA),
the Group of Mutual Support for Families of
Disappeared and Detained Persons (GAM), refugees that
have returned from Honduras to Alpemech and refugees
in the USA associated with Atanasio Tzul and the
women's organizations Mama Maquin, Ixmucan=82 and Madre
Tierra (Mother Earth).=20

Regrettably the Northwestern Section of the CCPP as
well as the Southern Section do not attend the
meetings of the ACPD.  These two sections had been
negotiating revisions of the credit arrangement with
the government along side the Northern Section, but
new social realities have arisen, such as in the case
of some refugees in Mexico, members of the
Northwestern Section of the CCPP, who no longer feel
represented by the CCPP, therefore they organized
themselves in a new group called the Coordination of
Blocks for Return and Resettlement of Refugees (CBRR).


Additionaly, the Guatemalan Association of Dispersed
Refugees (ARDIGUA) has existed for several years, but
has been only  partially recognized by the Mexican
Commission for Refuge Aid (COMAR) and the United
Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) even
though there is no doubt that they are refugees.  So,
the authorities of the UNHCR and the National Peace
Fund (FONAPAZ) were exacting pressure so that the
Permanent Commission would endorse ARDIGUA.   =20

On the 24th and 25th of May the ACPD met with the
National Commission for Returnees, Refugees and
Displaced People (CEAR) and FONAPAZ in a "locked door
marathon meeting".  The meeting dealt with the problem
of the legal regulation of credits and the application
of the accords signed on the 8th of October, 1992;
that they should protect the refugees in Mexico,
whether or not they be organized with the CCPP.  The
ACPD emphatically communicated to the government that
they would have no objection to the government
continuing its negotiations with the Northwestern and
Southern Sections of the CCPP.=20

However, they also demanded that the government
negotiate with the ACPD to revise the provisions
regarding credits and the application of the October
accords with the Northern Section of the Permanent
Commission, ARDIGUA, and the CBRR.  To deal with this
problem and all problems of the internally displaced
populations, a permanent table of dialogue was created
under the coordination of a high level functionary of
the government and a representative of the ACPD.  This
is a very notable development.  In the end the ACPD
was left feeling very grateful for the attitude of the
authorities of CEAR and FONAPAZ.=20

They reiterated their proposal and accepted our
proposals with some modifications that we found
reasonable.  With this one can be quite optimistic
that the dialogue will facilitate a solution to the
problems.  =20

On the first day of May of this year the existence of
a new political group, was made known publicly.=20
Calling itself the "Democratic Alternative of the
People" (ADP), it mentioned your name, referring to
you as one of the founders...  =20

I do belong to an organization called the "Popular
Action Group" (GAP).  This group is made up of
politicians from various sectors, unitarians,
pluralists and politicians of the left, yes, but with
criteria sufficiently broad in nature so as to promote
in our country the uniting of all the forces of the
left and popular democratic forces, including
representatives of the economic sector who understand
the need for certain transformations and changes.  The
GAP participated along with other sectors in the
creation of the Democratic Front for a New Guatemala
(FDNG).=20

Other organizations such as those in the Indigenous
sector and the union movement also participated.=20
There had been a decision made by consensus which
proposed the following individuals as possible
presidential candidates for the FDNG: Oscar Clemente
Marroquin Godoy, Gert Rosenthal, Alfonso Fuente Soria,
Dr. Argueta Figueroa y Alfonso Bauer Paiz.  However,
it turned it out that on a given day, a fax arrived
from Mexico City, saying that the economist Jorge
Gonzalez del Valle was accepting the nomination as the
presidential candidate.  A nomination that had not
even been discussed here in Guatemala, not even once!=20

It was then that I understood that this came from
outside decisions, and I understood that there had
already been a specific (political) line, and I
resigned.  The GAP supported my decision, advising me
at no time do we want to cause divisions among the
FDNG.=20

We were a fundamental factor in its creation and we
remain committed to the FDNG in a moral way.  We did
not want to participate in the electoral event, but we
announced that if the moment arrives to revise the
Constitution of the Republic, yes we'll be there in
the struggle to elect deputies to the Constituent
Assembly.  This Assembly should demand new norms for
the true establishment of a democracy that is
pluralist, participatory and socially just.   =20

As far as my participation in the ADP I can only tell
you that this is absolutely false.  The day after the
notice was published in the Prensa Libre, Factor
Mendez and I sent a statement of explanation in which
we said that we are members of the GAP, that we
support the FDNG and declare our participation for
reasons that deal with hegemonic and hierarchical
attitudes that had been (present), but that we
continue struggling so that the Democratic Front might
strengthen the unity of the popular forces.  In no way
do we want to be divisive.  For us, despite its
limitations, the Democratic Front is the only popular
(political) expression. =20

The mention of our names was done with absolutely no
consultation and it is painful that the Prensa Libre
has not published the clarification.  =20

What is your vision of the political panorama in
Guatemala between the signing of the peace and the
year 2,000?   =20

It is very restless.  I am not a pessimistic fatalist,
in some way I have maintain a fairly utopian outlook
since my adolescence and youth, utopian in the sense
of Tomas Moro in the Middle Ages, and of Che Guevara
in recent times.  But given the concrete realities,
and the prospects that lie between now and the year
2000, I fear that upon signing the peace accords, the
organizations that form the URNG, might constitute a
volatile group, and that a reoccurrence of what
happened in El Salvador and in Nicaragua with the FMLN
and the Sandanistas, could result. In [these cases]
the great forces of economic power and the military
remain in tact.  I hope that all of this does not
occur [in Guatemala] and that the popular forces as
well as the political-military forces of the
insurgency maintain their unity.=20

          LA POLICIA NACIONAL Y EL RESPETO A LOS DERECHOS HUMANOS



* Toda persona tiene derecho a que se respete su integridad fisica, psiquica

y moral.



* La violacion de este derecho constituye delito y sera penado por la ley

(Arto. 36, Constitucion Politica).



De manera reiterada, la Asociacion Nicaraguense Pro Derechos Humanos (ANPDH),

a traves de comunicaciones escritas y de publicaciones, ha venido planteando

a los altos mandos de la Policia Nacional, la situacion de impunidad en que

quedan violaciones a los derechos humanos cometidos por algunos miembros de

dicha institucion.



Pese a que hemos podido observar, a traves de los diversos medios de

comunicacion, que oficiales de policia son llevados ante los tribunales de

justicia, consideramos que aun falta mucho por hacer, por ejemplo documentar

casos y darle el tramite establecido por las leyes vigentes de la Republica.

Un alto porcentaje de los casos reportados por ANPDH ante la Inspectoria

General aun esperan respuesta.



Las victimas que recurren a ANPDH expresan que el respeto a la integridad

fisica y en algunos casos al de la vida, es utopia frente a las autoridades

policiales y una alta dosis de impotencia y ansias de justicia, se refleja en

los rostros de cada uno de esos nicaraguenses.



Durante el ultimo Trimestre, ANPDH recibio un total de 164 denuncias y de

estas, 90 senalan como supuestos agentes violadores de los derechos humanos

a miembros de la Policia Nacional. Nos esta preocupando mucho que entre los

casos senalados aparezcan como victimas un significativo numero de menores de

edad que no alcanzan los diez anos. Entre los tipos de violacion mas comunes

que contienen los alegatos se encuentran tratos inhumanos y degradantes,

amenazas de muerte, detenciones arbitrarias y abusos de autoridad.



A manera de ilustracion mencionaremos tres hechos denunciados ante ANPDH, que

reflejan un comportamiento al margen de la ley y de los compromisos

internacionales contraidos por Nicaragua en materia de derechos humanos:



     1.- El 12 de marzo de 1996, en la comarca El Platanal Norte,

     jurisdiccion del municipio de Camoapa, departamento de Boaco, 3

     oficiales de la Policia Nacional de Camoapa, se habrian presentado a la

     casa de habitacion de DOMINGO FARGAS, con intenciones de detenerlo y al

     no encontrarlo, golpearon de manera cruel e inhumana al menor de 14 anos

     de edad, PEDRO ZELEDON GARCIA, sobrino de Fargas, quien habita en la

     misma casa y se encontraba enfermo. La parte denunciante declaro haber

     visto que el menor Zeledon Garcia, fue tomado del cuello y cuando los

     policias se dieron cuenta que respiraba con dificultad, uno de ellos le

     dijo a otro que lo dejara, porque lo iba a matar.



     De acuerdo a lo expuesto ante ANPDH, lo condujeron al patio de la casa,

     donde continuaron los malos tratos, le colocaron las manos hacia atras,

     le hicieron llaves y le propinaron golpes en todo el cuerpo.

     Posteriormente fue llevado a una casa vecina, donde se encontraba LESTER

     FARGAS GARCIA, hijo de Domingo Fargas, a quien amenazaron de muerte si

     no entregaba a su padre. El senor Domingo Fargas llego en ese momento y

     aunque no opuso ninguna resistencia, fue derribado de un golpe en la

     cara que le propino uno de los policias, con el fusil AK que portaba.

     Luego fue llevado a su vivienda, donde inicio otro episodio: a todos los

     miembros de la familia de don Domingo (ocho personas), entre las que se

     encontraban ninos, mujeres y ancianos, los habrian maltratado

     fisicamente sin motivo alguno. Un policia de nombre Jose Luis Martinez,

     de seudonimo Cucaracha, jefe del puesto policial de La Embajada, fue

     senalado como uno de los que participo en este hecho.



     El senor Domingo Fargas, fallecio el 27 de Abril del ano en curso. ANPDH

     fue informada que la muerte se debio a los golpes recibidos.



     2.- El 22 de marzo de 1996, en la ciudad de Esteli, ANA GUADALUPE LOPEZ

     AVILA, fue detenida por miembros de la Policia Nacional y sometida a

     interrogatorios por un policia de seudonimo "El Cabro". Despues de

     realizar un cateo de la vivienda, Ana Guadalupe y sus hijas YAMILET y

     MARIA, de 14 y 12 anos respectivamente, fueron conducidas a la unidad

     policial. Tambien fueron detenidos los menores, ALVARO y YURI LOPEZ

     MENDOZA, de 5 y 3 anos de edad, OLMAN RIZO LOPEZ, de 8 anos y DANY

     LOPEZ, de 3 anos. En horas de la tarde obtuvieron libertad.



     3.- El 26 de abril de 1996, la senora Elsa Cantillano, activista de la

     Asociacion Nicaraguense Pro Derechos Humanos (ANPDH), se presento a la

     Unidad Policial del municipio de San Jose de los Remates, donde le

     fueron mostrados varios detenidos, entre otros TOMAS URBINA HUETE, quien

     expuso frente al Teniente Arnulfo Rocha, Jefe de la Unidad Policial,

     varios hechos violatorios a los derechos humanos, a que estaba siendo sometido.

     ANPDH fue informada que una vez que la senora Cantillano se retiro de la

     unidad, Urbina Huete fue sacado de la celda por el Teniente Arnulfo

     Rocha, y sometido a un interrogatorio por el motivo de haber dado

     declaraciones a una activista de derechos humanos.



     De acuerdo a investigaciones realizadas, este mismo dia, don EULALIO

     URBINA ALCANTARA, padre de Tomas Urbina, se presento a la Unidad

     Policial, con el objetivo de pasarle alimentos y solicitar permiso para

     verlo, tanto a el como a otro hijo que estaba detenido y como respuesta

     el referido Teniente Rocha, le golpeo y amenazo con dejarlo detenido.



Si partimos del precepto Constitucional contenido en el Articulo 34, que dice

textualmente: "Toda persona tiene derecho a que se respete su integridad

fisica, psiquica y moral. Nadie sera sometido a torturas, procedimientos,

penas ni a tratos crueles, inhumanos o degradantes. La violacion de este

derecho constituye delito y sera penado por la ley", entonces, es la hora de

que las autoridades competentes del Ministerio de Gobernacion, inicien

acciones, a fin de remediar estas violaciones de derechos humanos, evitando

asi situaciones que menoscaban la dignidad humana de los nicaraguenses y el

establecimiento de un Estado de Derecho.

                                 EDITORIAL



* La actividad del Ejercito debe estar sujeta a la Autoridad Civil.



Las denuncias recibidas en ANPDH complementadas con las informaciones

brindadas por los medios de comunicacion, nos muestran un cuadro preocupante

de los indices actuales de violencia. Las recientes declaraciones de Su

Eminencia Reverendisima Cardenal Miguel Obando y Bravo sobre el estado de

impunidad y la indefension juridica deben llamarnos a la reflexion. El

Prelado de la Iglesia Catolica manifesto, con posterioridad al ultimo

atentado terrorista contra un colegio catolico: "Puede seguir esto por

desgracia, porque el peligro que yo veo aqui es que tomaron presos en Masaya

y a los tres dias estaban libres, entonces es peligroso que estas cosas

estimulen la delincuencia, el crimen, el terrorismo". (Diario La Tribuna, 13

de mayo de 1996).



Este mismo patron ha estado reproduciendose en algunas areas rurales de

nuestro pais, creando ademas una desconfianza de la poblacion hacia las

autoridades del orden publico y la administracion de justicia. Reveladoras

fueron las declaraciones del Sr. Jaime Arauz, Alcalde de La Dalia: "los

delincuentes salen libres a los dias de haber sido capturados por la Policia,

situacion que siembra temor en el campesinado para interponer denuncias".



Por otra parte cabe preguntarnos (Como calificariamos la situacion actual?

(Estado de paz o de guerra? El Diario La Prensa en su edicion del 20 de abril

hizo mencion a la informacion brindada por voceros militares de que "un total

de 27 muertos y 31 heridos es el saldo dejado por los combates entre tropas

del Ejercito y las bandas de delincuentes que asolan las zonas montanosas de

las regiones norte y central del pais". Mas adelante la informacion noticiosa

nos da a conocer que los grupos armados tienen en su poder arsenal belico que

de no ser incautado, les permitiria continuar sus actividades por un tiempo:

"se han logrado capturar a 148 sujetos integrantes de las bandas de

delincuentes comunes a los que tambien se les han incautado una gran cantidad

de armas entre los que destacan fusiles AK, rifles calibre 22, granadas de

mano y fusiles M-16".



En recientes declaraciones el citado Alcalde manifesto que "unos 120

campesinos han sido asesinados por bandas delictivas y grupos armados que

operan en sectores de La Dalia en los ultimos 12 meses", lo que nos indica

que la seguridad ciudadana continua ausente. Interesante seria conocer

cuantos de estos casos han sido investigados por la Policia Nacional y de

cuantos han abierto causa judicial los tribunales de justicia, a fin de que

la poblacion se informe sobre las acciones tomadas por el Estado para

salvaguardar el derecho a la vida y la justicia.



Aspectos economicos y politicos estan siendo afectados por la violencia. Se

avecina en el pais un proceso amenazado por la violencia. No podemos permitir

que tanto la formacion del padron electoral como el deposito del voto se vean

entorpecidos. Por otra parte, la garantia de sacar adelante la produccion del

pais, continua siendo demandada por los sectores involucrados.



Las rondas de conversaciones entre diferentes sectores, parecen indicar que

el Ejercito jugara un rol importante en la erradicacion de la violencia. Sin

embargo los errores del pasado han sido muchos, por lo que demandamos que las

actividades que realicen los miembros del Ejercito se ajusten a la autoridad

civil y a los principios consagrados en la Constitucion Politica de

Nicaragua, y que su intervencion sea apolitica, apartidista, profesional y

con la finalidad de contribuir a la estabilidad del pais.

            LAS ELECCIONES Y EL PROCURADOR DE DERECHOS HUMANOS



* Los Derechos Politicos deben ser tutelados en todo momento.



* Durante una Campana Electoral, su cumplimiento debe ser vigilado por el

Procurador de Derechos Humanos.



Los Derechos Humanos, expresion que consiguio consagrarse hasta el ano 1945,

en que aparece la Carta de las Naciones Unidas, pareciera tener un

significado diferente para gobernantes y gobernados en diferentes epocas,

porque aunque es cierto que en todos los tiempos existen violaciones,

desprecio o mal entendidos hacia los derechos humanos, no es menos cierto que

los mas elementales valores del ser humano han sido menospreciados durante

todas las epocas. En Nicaragua, a partir de 1990 hemos recorrido un dificil

camino tratando de alcanzar el derrotero que nos conduzca hacia una verdadera

democracia.



La institucion de la Procuraduria de Derechos Humanos, en nuestro pais, surge

con las reformas a la Constitucion Politica y aunque hubo grandes

expectativas en cuanto a su creacion y al rango que esta iba a tener,

finalmente se aprobo su existencia a traves de una Ley Ordinaria y unicamente

la eleccion del Procurador y Sub-Procurador Nacional, quedaron reservados

como una facultad de la Asamblea Nacional, lo que si bien es cierto no era lo

deseable, en el inciso 2 de la Ley Creadora de la Procuraduria para la

Defensa de los Derechos Humanos, se establece independencia, no sujecion a

ninguna autoridad y sometimiento unicamente a la Carta Magna y a las Leyes

del pais.



Esta Ley fue aprobada el ocho de Enero de mil novecientos noventa y seis,

publicada oportunamente en el Diario Oficial y a mas de cuatro meses, ni ha

sido aprobado su Reglamento, ni se ha nombrado al Procurador, lo que es un

claro indicativo que el tema de los derechos humanos en Nicaragua, aun no

tiene mucha importancia como pilar basico para el fortalecimiento del Estado

de Derecho y la Institucionalidad de nuestra naciente democracia.



Ahora bien, en Nicaragua estamos a las puertas de un proceso electoral que

culminara el proximo 20 de Octubre, tenemos vigente la nueva Ley Electoral,

pero no contamos con mecanismos efectivos y una cultura politica que

garanticen una buena marcha de dicho proceso, lo que nos hace pensar que los

bemoles o inconvenientes que devengan, necesitaran en mucho del auxilio del

Procurador de Derechos Humanos, en cuanto a la tutela de los derechos

ciudadanos.



Por ello, el respeto a los derechos politicos, consignados tanto en la

Constitucion Politica como en la Convencion Americana de Derechos Humanos,

Declaracion Universal de Derechos Humanos, Pacto Internacional de Derechos

Civiles y Politicos y otros instrumentos internacionales que tutelan estos

derechos, debe ser una realidad y como institucion rectora de la vigilancia

de ese respeto, resultaria sumamente necesario el nombramiento del Procurador

-llamemosle Comisionado para la Defensa de los Derechos Politicos- de los

ciudadanos durante la justa electoral que se aproxima, para que tanto los

nicaraguenses como  observadores internacionales que vengan a nuestro pais,

certifiquen que hubo limpieza no solamente en la emision y en el conteo de

los votos, sino tambien a lo largo de toda la campana electoral.



ANPDH desea llamar la atencion al Poder Legislativo sobre la necesidad

urgente de retomar en su agenda, el tema de la Reglamentacion de la Ley de la

Procuraduria para la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos y consecuentemente, la

eleccion del Procurador y Sub-Procurador, pasando asi de una vez de la teoria

a la practica en cuanto a la lucha por la vigencia de los derechos humanos.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------



       ANPDH CONSULTADA SOBRE PROYECTO DE LEY DE LA POLICIA NACIONAL



* La Policia Nacional tambien debe ser apoyo para las demas instituciones del

Estado.



A las 11 de la manana del 24 de mayo recien pasado, la Asociacion

Nicaraguense Pro Derechos Humanos (ANPDH) se presento ante la Comision

Defensa y Gobernacion de la Asamblea Nacional a exponer sus criterios sobre

el proyecto de Ley de la Policia Nacional.



El Dr. Julio Saborio, Director Ejecutivo de la ANPDH informo sobre la

relevancia especial que para este organismo de derechos humanos tenia esta

presentacion, ya que el contacto que se mantiene con la Policia Nacional es

constante, debido a la cantidad de denuncias de violaciones a los derechos

humanos que se recepcionan constantemente.

Los puntos expuestos por ANPDH estuvieron centrados en la necesidad de

adaptar la futura ley a los principios recogidos en la Constitucion Politica

del Pais. Por ejemplo, explico Saborio, el anteproyecto de ley no hace

referencia a la actividad de prevencion del delito que debe tener la

institucion policial, aspecto que si contempla la carta magna en su articulo

97. Esto es de suma importancia ya que en el plano practico obligara al

diseno de una estrategia preventiva, en la que se contemplen incluso

actividades de capacitacion tanto para los aspirantes a oficiales como

talleres de educacion informal a los policias ya en funciones.



ANPDH destaco que a lo largo de estos seis anos han sido dictadas

resoluciones por autoridades judiciales y administrativas, como por ejemplo

aquellas relacionadas con la devolucion de propiedades que fueron confiscadas

durante la decada de los ochenta y que en algunos casos estuvo ausente el

elemento de apoyo jurisdiccional que esta llamado a prestar el cuerpo

policial. Por ello recomienda el dejar claro el apoyo que la institucion

policial debe darle al resto de las autoridades estatales.



En su exposicion la ANPDH considero importante que dentro de la funcion de

llevar los archivos policiales, se contemple la actualizacion de los mismos

con un adecuado control cruzado con el Poder Judicial, ya que muchas personas

remitidas por la Policia Nacional son encontradas inocentes por los

tribunales de justicia. La actualizacion de los registros contribuira al

mantenimiento del buen nombre y dignidad de las personas.



Sobre la Inspectoria General de la Policia Nacional, fue destacado el rol que

ella juega en el analisis y estudio de la conducta de los oficiales, ya sea

en la comision de faltas o delitos, o en las violaciones a los derechos

humanos, por lo que ANPDH cree oportuno que debe imprimirsele una dinamica

muy particular en la cual cualquier delito no quede en la impunidad. Asi como

tomar en cuenta la responsabilidad de la Policia como institucion para que

cualquier lesion que le sea ocasionada a un ciudadano sea reparada, como por

ejemplo brindar asistencia medica a personas afectadas por actitudes de los

miembros policiales.



Se hizo enfasis en la sujecion de la institucion a las autoridades civiles,

particularmente en los departamentos del pais, por lo que sugirio se den

facultades precisas a los Delegados del Ministerio de Gobernacion en esta

materia, ya que el anteproyecto los contempla como simples supervisores de la

actividad policial.



Debido a los altos indices existentes en el pais de violencia contra la

mujer, ANPDH sugirio que la Comisaria de la Mujer y la Ninez sea una

especialidad mas de la institucion policial que no debe depender de la

Oficina de Investigaciones Criminales.



El Dr. Saborio manifesto a la prensa que considera que esta es una excelente

oportunidad para dejar establecido por ministerio de ley todas las

facultades, atribuciones y deberes de esta institucion encargada de velar por

el orden publico.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------



                    QUE ES LA C.I.D.H. PARA NICARAGUA?

* La CIDH promueve la observancia y la defensa de los Derechos Humanos.



La Comision Interamericana de Derechos Humanos (CIDH), es un organismo

autonomo de la Organizacion de Estados Americanos, esta integrada por siete

miembros, quienes deben ser personas de alta autoridad moral y versados en

materia de derechos humanos; tiene como funcion principal, la de promover la

observancia y la defensa de los derechos humanos y servir como organo

consultivo de la Organizacion en esta materia y representa a todos los

Estados miembros que la integran.



La CIDH realiza una funcion cuasi juridica, ya que examina e investiga

denuncias de violaciones de derechos humanos que se le presenten, escucha a

ambas partes y luego toma una decision, la que puede consistir en establecer

responsabilidades y emitir recomendaciones para remediar la situacion o en

otros casos, puede propiciar un arreglo amistoso, a fin de solucionar el

diferendo que exista y en caso de que esta ultima alternativa no funcione,

puede pasar el caso a la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos, asumiendo

la Comision el rol de Ministerio Publico frente al Estado presuntamente

violador de los derechos humanos.



En el caso de Nicaragua, la CIDH, a traves de comunicaciones que tanto la

Asociacion Nicaraguense Pro Derechos Humanos (ANPDH), como otros Organismos

hemos enviado, ha conocido sobre la situacion que impera en materia de

derechos humanos y que impiden el pleno disfrute de los mismos.



ANPDH desea referirse al caso del Dr. ARGES SEQUEIRA MANGAS, que se

encuentran ante la instancia de la CIDH y que a nuestro criterio, es uno de

los casos mas representativos que revela el grado de impunidad y violacion al

derecho a la justicia que existe en Nicaragua:



El 23 de Noviembre de 1992, el Dr. Arges Sequeira Mangas, de 58 anos de edad,

Presidente de la Asociacion de Confiscados y miembro directivo del Consejo

Superior de la Empresa Privada (COSEP), fue asesinado en la ciudad de El

Sauce, departamento de Leon.



El Juzgado Segundo de Distrito del Crimen de Leon, instruyo la causa y

durante el juicio, testigos identificaron plenamente a Frank Ibarra Silva,

German Lacayo Guerrero y Diego Javier Espinoza, todos ex miembros del

Ejercito Popular Sandinista y miembros de un grupo armado denominado "Fuerzas

Punitivas de Izquierda", como los autores del crimen en contra del Dr.

Sequeira Mangas. El juicio luego de una serie de inconvenientes, culmino con

una sentencia condenatoria dictada por el referido Juez, en contra de Frank

Ibarra Silva; sin embargo, inmediatamente despues este mismo Juez emitio una

resolucion en la que interpretando de manera erronea una Ley de Amnistia que

acababa de ser aprobada, expresa que esta cubierto con la misma, ordenando

asi su libertad. El Procurador de Justicia se opuso a dicha resolucion, apelo

de la misma y actualmente se encuentra en tramite en la Corte Suprema de

Justicia.



La Comision Interamericana de Derechos Humanos (CIDH), realizo el 23 de

febrero una audiencia especial sobre este caso, en la que estuvieron

presentes familiares del Dr. Sequeira Mangas, la ANPDH y la CPDH. En la cual

los organismos de derechos humanos solicitaron a los miembros de la Comision

que el caso fuera trasladado a la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos.

Este punto esta pendiente de resolucion.



Tenemos confianza en que la Comision Interamericana de Derechos Humanos

decidira el traslado del caso ante la Corte Interamericana de Derechos

Humanos, reconociendo de esta forma que el agotamiento de los Recursos

Internos en Nicaragua no es posible, ya que carecen de celeridad. Como

ejemplo podemos mencionar que a pesar que desde el 2 de agosto de 1995 la

Corte Suprema de Justicia de Nicaragua, emitio auto para dictar sentencia,

esta no ha sido dictada.

27 de mayo

+++  Grupos estudiantiles universitarios y una organizacion de
derechos humanos conformaron esta semana un movimiento de lucha
contra el proyecto que concede amnistia a 951 personas al tiempo
que advirtieron que realizarian protestas callejeras.
     El Movimiento Nacional contra la Impunidad (MUCI) lo integran
la Coordinadora Popular por los Derechos Humanos, el Movimiento
Nacional por la Justicia en Panama, el Frente Estudiantil
Revolucionario y el Centro de Estudiantes de la Facultad de Derecho
de la estatal Universidad de Panama.
     Fuentes del MUCI afirmaron que lo primordial del movimiento
sera tomarse las calles, cerrar las avenidas y fomentar protestas
contra el proyecto de amnistia a iniciarse su debate el proximo
miercoles 29 de mayo.


+++  La Confederacion de Jubilados y Pensionados concedio a las
autoridades gubernamentales una semana de plazo para el aumento de
sus emolumentos, pero advirtieron que de no cumplirse tomaran
nuevas medidas de protestas.
     Segun voceros de los jubilados fue tomada luego de reunirse
con la Comision de Alto Nivel nombrada por el mandatario Ernesto
Perez Balladares y aplazar nuevas protestas previstas para esta
semana.
     Entre las opciones para dar respuestas a los jubilados y
pensionados se presento un aumento en la cuota obrero-patronal y
cumplir con la exigencia de los ancianos, pero la misma fue rechaza
por el Consejo de Gabinete.


+++  El programa de vivienda que realiza el gobierno nacional
comtempla eliminar para 1998 en un 60% la cantidad de casas
condenadas de la ciudad capital, aseguro este lunes el viceministro
de Vivienda, Rogelio Parades.
     Paredes explico que el programa de viviendas incentivara a los
residentes en casas condenas "para que se dirijan a lugares fuera
de la metropoli".
     Agrego que una vez desalojadas las casas inmediatamente se
iniciara la construccion de nuevos inmuebles tipo unifamiliar con
el apoyo de la empresa privada.


28 de mayo

+++  Las inmediaciones del Campus Central de la estatal Universidad
de Panama fue nuevamente escenario de disturbios y protestas cuando
este lunes grupos estudiantiles rechazaron por tercera semana un
proyecto de ley que concede amnistia a 951 exfuncionarios de
gobierno, asi como legisladores de la actual Asamblea Legislativa.
     Las protestas liderizadas por el movimiento estudiantil FER-29
provoco el cierre de calles que impidio el transito vechicular por
espacio de 6 horas y al menos 46 estudiantes lesionados por gases
lacrimogenos y perdigones lanzados por miembros de la Policia
Nacional.
     Los estudiantes exigen ser tomados en cuenta en la discusion
de la lista de beneficiados que empezo a circular la semana pasada 
y que de aquella sean eliminados los exmilitares que violaron sus
derechos durante el periodo 1987-1989.
     Ante los sucesos las autoridades universitarias ordenaron el
cierre indefinido de la maxima casa de estudios hasta una segunda
nueva orden.


+++  El presidente de la Republica, Ernesto Perez Balladares, dijo
este lunes que vetara el proyecto de amnistia si incluye casos de
peculado y homicidio.
     Perez Balladares manifesto su respeto por los poderes del
Estado y afirmo que el Parlamento sabe lo que discutira, pero
advirtio que de presentarse "un proyecto sucio" lo vetara.
     El proyecto de amnistia iniciara su debate con una lista de
951 personas, incluidos algunos casos de peculado y homicidio. El
proyecto ha recibido rechazo de grupos estudiantiles y partidos de
oposicion.


+++  La posibilidad de negociar un nuevo tratado canalero entre los
gobiernos de Panama y Washington que permita un mejor mantenimiento
al Canal de Panama sugirio el propuesto Administrador de la via
interoceanica del actual gobierno, Alberto Aleman.
     La sugerencia de Aleman, realizada durante el encuentro Panama
2,000, indico que un estudio de mantenimiento e inversion de un
grupo de ingenieros del Ejercito de Estados Unidos revelo que se
necesita la inversion de 600 millones de dolares desde 1986 hasta
el ano 2,005.
     Agrego que los principales componentes de ese programa seria
la conclusion del ensanche del Corte Culebra, la adquisicion de 28
nuevas locomotoras del Canal y el reemplazo de las 82 existentes.
     De acuerdo a Aleman el Tratato Torrijos-Carter comtempla la
entrega de la via interoceanica libre debe de deudas y compromisos.
     "Ello significa que existe una restriccion para poder
desarrollar nuevas inversiones de capital en estos momentos, porque
las mismas seran vinculadas al nivel de ingresos y gastos que tenga
el actual Canal", preciso Aleman.


+++  Parlamentarios indigenas de las bancadas de oposicion y
gobierno decidieron unir esfuerzos y luchar por una vicepresidencia
dentro de la Asamblea Legislativa para su nueva directiva 1996-
1997.
     Felipe Serrano, diputado Ngobe del oficialista Partido
Revolucionario Democratico (PRD), afirmo que desde 1903 los
indigenas han sido discriminados y excluidos de las estructuras de
poder.
     Actualmente existen un total de cinco legisladores indigenas,
pero cada uno actuara de acuerdo a sus intereses etnicos y dentro
del marco de su colectivo politico, advirtio Serrano.


+++  En su primer dia de jornada del Encuentro "Panama 2,000",
auspiciado por la ONU, el mandatario Ernesto Perez Balladares
aseguro que no negociara el Tratado Neutralidad del Canal.
     Perez Balladares explico que el Tratado de Neutralidad 
-firmado a perpetuidad en 1979- no permite una intervencion armada
de Estados Unidos contra Panama en caso de atentados a la via
interocenica como se ha estado denunciado.
     "El Canal de Panama se cuida y se vigila con una fuerza
policiva, como la que tenemos nosotros; no necesita ser protegido,
ni vigilado por mas que eso", sostuvo el mandatario.
     Agrego que el Canal para su proteccion no necesita una
proteccion militar eso es "una excusa" utilizada en el pasado para
militarizar nuestro pais y "nosotros cometemos un error".
     

+++  Denuncias sobre la escasez de alimentos de primera necesidad
en la provincia del Darien que afectan a 26 comunidades hizo
publica este lunes una legisladora oficialista.
     La diputada Haydee Milanes, del Partido Solidaridad, indico
que en la mayoria de las 26 comunidades que conforman la provincia
se observa la escasez de arroz, aceite, azucar, sal y productos que
son transportados desde la ciudad capital.
     El problema en la provincia es serio desde el hundimiento de
la embarcacion "Nino Mauricio" -sentencio la diputada- porque la
region permanece ahora incomunicada a raiz que el gobierno regulo
los viajes y los alimentos no pueden transportarse.
     
29 de Mayo

+++  La reunion del Encuentro "Panama 2,000" termino este martes
con el compromiso del gobierno y los partidos de oposicion de
excluir la politica partidista en las decisiones que impliquen al
Canal de Panama.
     Al encuentro asistieron todos los partidos politicos -excepto
el Partido Arnufista quien se nego a participar- el Consejo
Nacional de Trabajadores Organizados, el Sindicato de Trabajadores
del Canal, el Consejo de Nacional de la Empresa Privada y la
Asociacion de Pequenos y Medianos Productores.
     El tema central del Encuentro fue la transicion del Canal a
manos panamenas en el ano 2,000, los retos del futuro de la via
interoceanica y su gobernabilidad.
     Los participantes acordaron consolidar el Estado de Derecho y
darle vigencia a la desmilitarizacion de la Nacion, lograr un
funcionamiento institucional, publico y privado.
     Tambien se acordo celebrar otras reuiones-encuentros al menor
tiempo posible donde sea tratado el anteproyecto sobre la Ley de la
Autoridad del Canal de Panama, el Plan General de Uso de Suelos y
el Plan Regional de la Autoridad de la Region Interoceanica.
     Los presentes manifestaron su acuerdo en que sera necesario
celebrar elecciones libres y transparentes en 1999 bajo la
supervision de organismos internacionales para el gobierno que
asuma el poder y reciba el Canal sea democratico y respetado.


30 de Mayo

+++  Una publicacion britanica que sugirio que la campana electoral
del gobernante panameno Ernesto Perez Balladares en 1994 fue
financiada con dinero sucio producto de las drogas, volvio a
reavivar un polemico debate sobre este tema surgido semanas atras.
     La primera reaccion fue del Presidente Perez Balladares quien
reto a la publicaci"n y a cualquier otra agencia internacional a
que pruebe que en su campana se utilizo dinero del narcotrafico.
     La revista The Economist que se edita en Londres planteo en un
articulo la posibilidad que en la campana del PRD en las elecciones
de 1994 se utilizo dinero proveniente del narcotrafico.
     Perez Balladares afirmo que el PRD esta dispuesto a abrir sus
libros para que se conozca la procedencia de los fondos utilizados
en la campana politica, "siempre y cuando los demas partidos que
participaron en la contienda electoral hagan lo mismo".
     Segun el subsecretario del PRD y tambien Ministro de Vivienda,
Francisco Sanchez Cardenas, la campana politica del PRD costo 2.7
millones de dolares y fue financiada por empresarios.


+++  Un estudio de competitividad de la Zona Libre de Colon revelo
que el nuevo regimen tributario, la falta de planificacion
estrategica de mercado, la deficiente infraestructura, los
excesivos controles comerciales y la pobre seguridad son los 
principales factores que inciden en la perdida de competitividad de
la zona franca
     El estudio anadio que la Zona Libre debe redefinir su rol
dentro de la nueva tendencia de liberalizacion de los mercados, de
lo contrario desaperecera su liderazgo historico y su comercio
decrecera.
     El informe elaborado por la firma consultora Peat Marwick
atribuyo la merma de la competitividad de la zona franca a las
nuevas formas de comercio, cambio de rutas, tecnologia y las
politicas de comercio adoptadas en el hemisferio.
     
     El presidente de la Asociacion de Usuarios de la Zona Libre de
Colon, Giovanni Ferrari dijo al diario "El Panama America" que su
gremio estudiara el documento el que califico como "un trabajo
profesional con mucha informacion interesante".
     

31 de Mayo

+++  El Comando Sur acantonado en Panama desarticulo una unidad de
inteligencia perteneciente a la Fuerza Aerea y cuya operacion se
remonta a la segunda guerra mundial, divulgo esta semana el "Tropic
Time".
     El periodico del Comando Sur "Tropic Time" informo que la
ceremonia de desactivacion del escuadron 33 de inteligencia,
dirigido por el Mayor Michael Howe, se verifico el 17 de mayo en la
Base Aerea de Howard.
     Howe afirmo que el Centro de Inteligencia de Medina en San
Antonio, Estado de Texas, absorbera la mayoria de las misiones del
escuadron 33, pero algunas tareas han sido asignadas a la Brigada
470 de Inteligencia del Ejercito.
     El escuadron 33 efectuo 87 misiones durante la invasion
militar estadounidense a Panama en diciembre de 1989.


+++  En dos meses la compania de electricidad panamena tendra listo
un proyecto de ley para restructurar esa dependencia y privatizar
algunos de sus servicios, anuncio esta semana su director general.
     Fernando Aramburu, nuevo gerente del Instituto de Recursos
Hidraulicos y Electrificacion (IRHE) rindio un informe en la
Asamblea Nacional Legislativa en la que propuso un modelo similar
al adoptado para las telecomunicaciones.
     Aramburu sostuvo que lo mas apropiado es que las plantas
hidroelectricas se queden en poder del estado, mientras que las
termoelectricas las operen la empresa privada.
     En el nuevo modelo propuesto, el director general del IRHE
anuncio que probablemente el sistema de cobro de tarifas de energia
electrica estara a cargo del sector privado, con el mayor enfasis
en el cobro de cuentas que se adeudan a la compania estatal
electrica.


+++  Un proyecto que contempla la despenalizacion de los delitos de
calumnia e injuria recibio el rechazo de varios gremios de juristas
paname$os, se informo este viernes.
     Asi lo expreso la abogada Mariblanca Staff, presidenta de la
Union Nacional de Mujeres Abogadas, quien sostuvo que la
"tipificacion de la calumnia e injuria como un delito dentro de la
legislacion penal constituye un freno para aquellas personas que
quieren denigrar y atentan contra la honra de las personas que es
uno de los bienes mas sagrados que tiene el ser humano".
     La declaracion de Staff se dio en una mesa redonda que
organizo su gremio para discutir la ley no. 90 sobre calumnia e
injuria que se debate en la Comision de Comunicacion y Transporte
de la Asamblea Nacional Legislativa.
     La jurista indico que existe un consenso en la mayoria de los
gremios de abogados que se muestra favorable con la derogacion de
las denominadas de las actuales leyes de prensa, "que atentan
contra la libertad de expresion", pero existe un rechazo con el
proyecto de despenalizacion de los delitos de calumnia e injuria.
     
     


     mos internacionales para el gobierno que
asuma el poder y reciba el Canal sea democratico y respetado.

20 de mayo

+++  Una nota de prensa de la Cancilleria de Panama reconocio este
lunes haber autorizado vuelos de aviones y helicopteros militares
de Estados Unidos para sobrevolar areas en la frontera colombo-
panamena.
     Segun versiones publicadas en la prensa nacional el Senado
colombiano denuncio que aviones militares norteamericanos habian
violado su territorio.
     La nota, firmada por el Director de Prensa de la Cancilleria,
Eric Rodiriguez, senala que los sobrevuelos tenian como finalidad
identificar y detectar edificios simulados y posibles sitios de
aterrizaje presuntamente asociados al trafico de drogas, pero que
los mismos no se realizaron.
     Agrega que la autorizacion al Comando Sur de Estados Unidos
constituye un mecanismo de cooperacion internacional en la lucha
contra las drogas que otorga Panama como Estado libre y soberano.


+++  Una dirigente de oposicion denuncio este lunes una posible
disolucion del Parlamento panameno y la convocatoria a una asamblea
constituyente como formula para acceder a la reelecion
presidencial.
     La presidenta del partido Arnulfista, Mireya Moscoso, denuncio
que la intencion del oficialista Partido Revolucionario Democratico
(PRD) radica en reelegir a Ernesto Perez Balladares y ver realizado
"su sueno de recibir el Canal" en diciembre de 1999.
     Agrego que conociendo la trayectoria autocratica de quienes
detentan el poder actualmente, es necesario alertar a la ciudadania
sobre el engano, ajeno al marco legal, para promover la disolucion
del Parlamento.
     Al referirse a la celebracion del "Encuentro Panama 2,000",
auspiciado por la Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el
Desarrollo (PNUD) donde se tratara el tema de la transferencia del
Canal a Panama, Moscoso afirmo que el tema de la gobernabilidad a
tratar en dicho encuentro, no se determina a traves de foros, ni
conferencias.


     Por su parte, el mandatario Perez Balladares expreso que las
denuncias de la dirigente de oposicion fueron parte de "un momento
de excitacion politica".
     Las aseveraciones de Moscoso fueron vertidas durante un mitin
politico esta semana en la Provincia de Chiriqui.


21 de mayo

+++  Al menos dos desaparecidos, cinco lesionados y una decena de
personas afectadas por insolacion fue el resultado del hundimiento
de un barco con travesia desde la provincia del Darien hacia la
ciudad de Panama.
     Segun autoridades del Servicio Nacional de Proteccion Nacional
Civil (SINAPROC), el hundimiento de la embarcacion "Nino Mauricio"
fue provocado por el sobrepeso y por un fuerte oleaje que imperaba
en las aguas del Oceano Pacifico.
     La nave zarpo desde Garachine en horas de la madrugada con 76
pasajeros, 9 novillos, mas de 7,000 pies de madera, 40 quintales de
maiz. La embarcacion solo tenia capacidad para 40 pasajeros.
     El Capitan de la embarcacion, Arturo Rivera, explico que el
mal tiempo incidio y que las bombas utilizadas para achicar el agua
se taparon y el barco empezo a hundirse.
     Fuentes de SINAPROC informaron que ancianos, jovenes y ninos
flotaban en el agua sobre cilindros, tubos, tablas y salvavidas.
Este incidente es el segundo que ocurre en menos de dos meses luego
que sucediera igual suceso la nave "El Almirante.


+++  Desde Washigton se informo que la organizacion humanitaria
"Human Rights Watch/America" solicito este lunes en carta dirigida
al presidente de la Camara Legislativa, Carlos Alvarado, rechazar
el proyecto de amnistia para aquellas personas acusadas de graves
violaciones y advirtio una posible sancion para Panama.
     Segun la nota firmada por el Director y Subdirectora Ejecutiva
de la organizacion Jose Miguel Vivanco y Anne Mannuel,
respectivamente, los diputados panamenos deben garantizar que el
proyecto de amnistia no se traduzca en impunidad en favor de los
acusados o condenados por violaciones a los derechos humanos.
     Tambien recordo a los parlamentarios tener en cuenta las
obligaciones juridicas internacionales que tiene Panama en materia
de derechos humanos.
     Americas Watch recordo que la Comision Interamericana de
Derechos Humanos de la OEA condeno las amnistias promulgadas en El
Salvador, Uruguay y Argentina por violar la Convencion Americana y
recordo que podria sancionar a Panama si adopta medidas semejantes.

+++  Nuevas protestas contra la ley de amnistia llevaron a cabo
este martes estudiantes universitarios cuando por espacio de siete
horas impidieron el transito vehicular en las inmediaciones del
Campus Central, de la estatal Universidad de Panama, exigiendo a
diputados de la Comision de Amnistia escuchar la opinion
universitaria.
     Los dirigentes estudiantiles de la Universidad de Panama
expresaron su rechazo al proyecto por considerar que no se le puede
otorgar amnistia a exmilitares que violaron sus derechos humanos
durante los anos 1987-1989.
     Informaciones publicadas en medios locales se$alaron que las
protestas provocaron al menos 28 heridos y seis detenidos, dos de 
ellos menores de edad, los cuales fueron conducidos a la Carcel
Modelo. 


+++  La Comision de Amnistia del Partido Revolucionario Democratico
(PRD) revelo este miercoles los nombres de las personas incluidas
en la lista de amnistia al tiempo que la oposicion califico la
lista de personas como "criminales y delincuentes".
     La lista incluye a 951 personas, entre ellos 13 diputados de
la actual Asamblea Legislativa y 12 exmiembros de las antiguas las
Fuerzas de Defensa de Panama.
     Segun el acuerdo previo con miembros de organizaciones no
gubernamentales y la Iglesia Catolica, la Comision de Amnistia
reafirmo la no inclusion de delitos de homicidio y peculado, pero
la lista final contempla algunos de estos delitos.
     Durante la presentacion de la lista a la prensa se informo que
una vez finalizada su discusion y aprobacion en primer debate en la
Comision de Gobierno, el proyecto sera presentado el proximo lunes
26 de mayo al Pleno parlamentario.
     La bancada parlamentaria de oposicion aseguro que votara en
contra del proyecto. El proyecto de amnistia incluyo a 5 diputados
de oposicion. 


+++  El Consejo General Universitario de la Universidad de Panama
condeno el uso excesivo de la fuerza de la Policia Nacional en las
protestas estudiantiles del pasado martes y denuncio la violacion
a la autonomia universitaria.
     Jorge Arosemena, Vicerector de Investigacion, dijo que la
policia antimontines penetro las inmediaciones del Campus
Universitario violando el derecho estudiantil a protestar.
     Durante la protesta del pasado martes resultaron detenidos 6
estudiantes universitarios, que fueron liberados al dia siguiente
con el pago de una multa

23 de mayo

+++  En medio de violentas acusaciones y agresiones entre
parlamentarios el proyecto que concede amnistia a 951 personas
acusadas de delitos politicos fue aprobado este jueves en primer
debate en la Comision de Gobierno de la Asamblea Legislativa.
     Informaciones publicadas en diarios locales revelaron que
durante la discusion del proyecto el presidente de la Comision de
Gobierno, Roberto Abrego, sometio a votacion el proyecto sin haber
finalizado los diputados su participacion en el debate.
     Parlamentarios de la bancada de oposicion coincidieron en
senalar que la medida de Abrego era una clara accion dictatorial y
de manipulacion.
     La lista de amnistia que sera presentada ante el pleno
legislativo el proximo lunes 27 de mayo pretende amnistiar a 951
personas, entre ellos 13 legisladores (8 oficialistas y 5 de
oposicion) y 12 exmiembros del Estado Mayor de las exFuerzas de
Defensa.
     

+++  Denuncias de mala alimentacion en el Carcel Publica de la
provincia de Colon formularon este jueves familiares de los
detenidos, al tiempo que advirtieron que en esta penitenciaria no
existe una cocina.
     Sonia Hernandez, madre de un reo, afirmo que la comida no
llega a la hora indicada y de un total de 200 se quedan sin comer
50 detenidos.
     El Alcalde de la provincia, Alcibiades Gonzalez, exhorto al
gobierno para adoptar medidas que resuelvan el problema de los
reclusos. La Carcel Publica fue inaugurada recientemente por el
presidente, Ernesto Perez Balladares.


+++  Un millar de pobladores fueron afectados por las intensas
lluvias que cayeron este jueves por espacio de tres horas en la
ciudad capital y la caribena provincia de Colon produciendo
inundaciones y deslizamientos de tierra.
     El Sistema Nacional de Proteccion Civil (SINAPROC) informo que
los rios Curundu, Matias Hernandez y Matasnillo subieron de nivel.
Las zonas mas afectadas fueron Calle 50, Carrasquilla, Vista
Hermosa, San Francisco, Parque Lefebre, Curundu, urbanizacion Las
Acacias, todas en la capital.
     En Col"n los deslizamientos de tierras producto de las fuertes
lluvias afectaron las barriadas de Cativa, Nuevo Colon, Villa
Liriola, San Mateo, Santa Rita y Nazareno. Unas 140 viviendas
fueron afectadas.
     El informe de la SINAPROC revelo que 360 personas en la ciudad
de Panama y 600 en Colon sufrieron los efectos de las lluvias.

24 de Mayo

+++  Tres empresas internacionales entregaron el pliego de
precalificacion para la compra del 49 por ciento de las acciones
del Instituto Nacional de Telecomunicaciones, INTEL S.A., se
anuncio este viernes.
     Las empresas South Western Bell Communication, GTE y Telefonia
Internacional de Espana, deben esperar tres semanas para que sean
examinados sus respectivos pliegos de precalificacion.
     Alfredo Macia, jefe de la Unidad de Privatizacion del
Ministerio de Hacienda y Tesoro, dijo que en esta fase el INTEL
S.A. puede precalificar a las tres empresas y en ese proceso
"negociar" con las mismas un contrato.
     El otro 49 por ciento de las acciones esta en manos del INTEL
S.A. y el otro dos por ciento lo poseen los trabajadores.


+++  Las protestas de los jubilados y pensionados arreciaron esta
semana en un intento por lograr el aumento de 40 dolares exigidos
al gobierno nacional.
     Los ancianos cerraron varias vias de circulacion vehicular en
la capital y en las principales cabeceras de provincia, a fin de
presionar a las autoridades de la Caja de Seguro Social para que
muestre una alternativa que no ponga en peligro las finanzas de la
instituci"n de seguridad social.
     Una propuesta hecha por el director de la Caja, Ricardo
Martinelli al Banco Nacional para que cumpla con una ley que obliga
a la entidad bancaria cumplir con el pago de intereses de 5.15%
sobre los 773 millones de dolares que mantiene la CSS en dicha
entidad, pudiera ser una de las alternativas para acceder al
aumento que exigen los jubilados.
     La medida generaria recursos suficientes para proveer el
aumento, pero el Banco Nacional no ha reaccionado ante esta
propuesta.

PANORAMA DE LA SITUACION
 DE LOS
 DERECHOS HUMANOS EN PANAMA


INFORME SEMESTRAL
Enero - Junio de 1996

Centro de Capacitaci"n Social
-Panam -


Pasando revista a los principales acontecimientos de la realidad
de los derechos humanos que m s motivan nuestra preocupaci"n en estos
primeros seis meses de 1996, podemos resaltar con nitidez varios puntos: 

     1. El agravamiento de la crisis socioecon"mica, producto de la
implementaci"n de una pol!tica econ"mica, que en los #ltimos cinco meses ha
profundizado el desempleo, el incremento de los principales productos de
consumo de la canasta b sica de alimentos y la pobreza de amplias capas de la
poblaci"n paname$a.

     Aunque alrededor del !ndice de desempleo existen varias cifras.  Seg#n
versiones oficiales el porcentaje es de 13.9, pero la Cepal estim" el desempleo
14.3 por ciento, afectando en este momento a m s de 140 mil paname$os. 

     Estas cifras abarcan s"lo el desempleo abierto, y no al sector informal
de la econom!a que se acrecienta cada d!a.  Seg#n cifras de economistas
independientes afecta al 28 por ciento de la juventud paname$a.

     La pobreza que abarca el 48.6 por ciento de los 2,5 millones de
habitantes que tiene el pa!s es uno de los urgentes problemas a resolver por
el gobierno nacional.

     El hecho adquiere dimensiones graves, si tenemos en cuenta que la
cuarta parte de las familias se encuentran en situaci"n de pobreza cr!tica,
lo que significa, que poseen ingresos inferiores al costo de la 
canasta b sica de alimentos.
     
     En los #ltimos meses ha sido notorio el incremento en los precios de
productos b sicos como la leche y el pan.  Art!culos como el gas licuado y la
gasolina se encuentran bajo la libre oferta y demanda, ocasionando graves
desequilibrios en el presupuesto familiar por sus constantes alzas,
atribu!das por los funcionarios del gobierno a oscilaciones en el mercado
internacional del crudo.

     Las justas demandas de los 120 mil jubilados que exigen un aumento de
40 d"lares a sus pensiones, amenazaron con paralizar el pa!s, si el gobierno
del Presidente Ernesto Prez Balladares no satisface una promesa hecha
durante la campa$a electoral de 1994.

     Durante las #ltimas semanas los jubilados han realizado varias
movilizaciones callejeras para exigir el aumento a sus emolumentos. La
mayor!a de los jubilados y pensionados se encuentran entre los peores
remunerados en el pa!s.

     Los miles de desempleados de la Provincia de Col"n, aglutinados en el
Movimiento de Desempleados (MODESCO) se mantienen firmes en sus demandas de
puestos de trabajo, en momentos que el emporio comercial Zona Libre
atraviesa la ca!da de sus ventas durante el primer trimestre de este a$o en
cerca de 258 millones de d"lares. 

     El sector agropecuario, uno de los m s afectados por la apertura
comercial, contin#a oponindose a la reducci"n de aranceles sobre 44 rubros
agropecuarios, afectando sensiblemente productos como la cebolla y la carne
de cerdo.

     La posici"n del gobierno sobre esta materia es que no variar n la
medida, adoptada a inicios de enero de este a$o, pues esta una de las
condiciones impuestas a Panam  para su ingreso a la Organizaci"n Mundial del
Comercio.

     A la par de esta situaci"n, en un intento desesperado por atraer
inversiones, el gobierno nacional firm" los primeros convenios para la
explotaci"n de yacimientos de oro, cobre y otros minerales, localizados
principalmente en territorios donde habitan los pueblos ind!genas Ngbe-
Bugl, Kunas y Ember  Waunnan.

     Tal decisi"n mantiene un fuerte enfrentamiento entre ind!genas y
gobierno que no permitir n la entrada a sus territorios de las empresas
mineras, "Panacobre" y la canadiense "Keltin Western" para que efect#en
extracciones de cobre y oro, respectivamente.

     S"lo en los territorios contemplados en una propuesta de la comarca del
pueblo Ngbe-Bugl, existen 64 concesiones para la explotaci"n de minerales,
pero la que m s es objeto de preocupaci"n es la de Cerro Colorado, un
proyecto que en la dcada del 80 fue suspendido a ra!z de presiones del
movimiento social, por el mtodo de explotaci"n del cobre a "cielo abierto", el
cual produce efectos adversos a la salud y al medio ambiente.

     Cerro Colorado, considerado una de las vetas cupr!feras m s grandes
del mundo, tropieza con la oposici"n no s"lo de los ind!genas y campesinos, sino
de los grupos ecologistas, organismos de derechos humanos, entre otros,
quienes estudian la posibilidad de conformar un foro permanente de rechazo
a la explotaci"n minera que no se centra en el desarrollo humano.

     Por otra parte, en lo relativo a las finanzas p#blicas se conoci" en mayo
que el gobierno orden" medidas frreas para controlar el gasto p#blico.  El
consejo de gabinete tom" la decisi"n de congelar nuevos nombramientos en el
sector estatal, as! como la recontrataci"n a empleados temporales, aumentos
salariales y la disminuci"n de viajes al exterior.

     


     La medida responde a presiones ejercidas por el Fondo Monetario
Internacional, como parte de los compromisos adquiridos por Panam  para ser
sujeto de crdito. 

     Otra de las medidas sugeridas por este organismo financiero y otros
similares es la revisi"n de la ley de jubilaciones especiales, de la que se
benefician los maestros, profesores, las enfermeras y los polic!as, entre
otros sectores, que se proyecta eliminar para satisfacer las exigencias de
las agencias financieras internacionales.

     La aplicaci"n de una pol!tica econ"mica que no prioriza como centro una
sociedad con equidad es una de los principales caracter!sticas que configuran
el actual modelo de desarrollo econ"mico propuesto por el gobierno del
Presidente Ernesto Prez Balladares. Es urgente y necesario transformar la
actual pol!tica econ"mica, para dar paso a un proyecto nacional econ"mico donde
prevalezca el sentido de naci"n y la pr ctica de la solidaridad.

     De no darse esta condici"n estaremos profundizando los problemas
vinculados a la pobreza como el desempleo, la delincuencia, la drogadicci"n y
otros males que aquejan a la juventud, la infancia, la mujer, los ind!genas,
campesinos y los jubilados.


     2.  A la crisis perenne de la administraci"n de justicia, acusada de
ineficiencia por su alta morosidad judicial, ahora se agregan acusaciones de
corrupci"n y faltas a la tica de sus principales cabezas.

     
      Sobre los magistrados de la Sala Penal de la Corte Suprema de Justicia,
Jos Fa#ndes, Aura Emrita de Villalaz y Fabi n Echevers, pesan graves
acusaciones por un fallo judicial en el caso de una empresa internacional que
reclamaba unos 7 millones de d"lares a un banco local, as! como el
otorgamiento de medidas cautelares a varios narcotraficantes.

     Tal situaci"n provoc" que la Asamblea Legislativa conformara una
comisi"n ad-hoc para iniciar la investigaci"n sobre los magistrados, lo que ha
tra!do una fuerte controversia entre los dos "rganos del Estado sobre el
"alcance y sentido" del acto administrativo al crear dicha comisi"n.

     De acuerdo con la Constituci"n Nacional de 1972, en su art!culo 154,
numeral 1, que se refiere a las funciones judiciales de la Asamblea Nacional
Legislativa est  el de "conocer de las acusaciones o denuncias que se
presenten contra el Presidente de la rep#blica y los Magistrados de la Corte
Suprema de Justicia; juzgarlos, si a ello hubiere lugar, por actos ejecutados
en el ejercicio de sus funciones en perjuicio del libre funcionamiento del
poder p#blico o violatorios de la Constituci"n o las leyes"...

     Con paso lento avanzan los esfuerzos gubernamentales para reducir la
morosidad judicial.  Asimismo, no cesan las constantes reyertas de los reos
en las c rceles como consecuencia del hacinamiento.  El 70 por ciento de los
detenidos en las c rceles no han cumplido el tr mite judicial respectivo.

     La Nueva C rcel P#blica de Col"n, una de las mayormente afectadas por
el hacinamiento fue inaugurada en abril de este a$o, pero el traslado de los
reos se ha efectuado de manera lenta.

     3. Un proyecto de amnist!a que mantiene dividido a los sectores
pol!ticos de Panam , por la divulgaci"n en mayo de una lista que recomienda el
beneficio a unas 951 personas, entre los que se destacan exmilitares,
exfuncionarios, exlegisladores, periodistas y que incluye a legisladores
oficialistas y de oposici"n de la actual C mara Legislativa, volvi" a encender
los  nimos de quienes adversan el polmico proyecto, al entregar la Comisi"n
Especial de Amnist!a a la Comisi"n de Gobierno de la Asamblea Nacioanal el
resultado del examen de casi 1,000 expedientes.

     La Comisi"n de Gobierno de la Asamblea Legislativa aprob" en primer
debate la ley que ser  sometida al pleno del Parlamento a finales de mayo para
su aprobaci"n o rechazo.
     
     Esta es la quinta vez que legisladores oficialistas intentan aprobar una
ley de "punto final", en b#squeda por lograr la reconciliaci"n nacional. 

     El Centro de Capacitaci"n Social (CCS) considera fundamental que la
aprobaci"n de una ley de amnist!a cumpla con los preceptos de, 

a. Exclusi"n de personas vinculadas o condenadas por delitos de homicidio,
torturas y peculado.

     b. Inclusi"n de personas implicadas en delitos pol!ticos (electorales y
persecusi"n de !ndole judicial).

     c.  Debe considerarse la inclusi"n a los paname$os que combatieron contra
el Ejrcito de Estados Unidos durante la invasi"n a Panam  el 20 de diciembre de
1989.

     4. En trminos de inseguridad ciudadana, los organismos de seguridad
informaron que en los primeros tres meses de 1996, el !ndice de delitos se
redujo en 16 por ciento, en comparaci"n al mismo per!odo de 1995.  Pero
contrariamente, a lo divulgado por la Fuerza P#blica, los #ltimos meses
revelan un aumento en los delitos de secuestro y tr fico ilegal de
estupefacientes.

     Uno de los puntos de mayor preocupaci"n lo constituye las evidencias de
corrupci"n de agentes de polic!a y extralimitaci"n en el uso de la fuerza.
Desde 1995 por lo menos 600 casos aparecen registrados en una investigaci"n
interna dentro de la Polic!a.
     
     Las irregularidades est n relacionadas con el consumo de bebidas
alcoh"licas en horas de trabajo, estafa por llamadas telef"nicas
internacionales, uso indebido de fondos en compras para combustible y
alimentos, uso excesivo de la fuerza durante los arrestos y tambin delitos
de secuestro y "tumbe" (apropiaci"n de dinero de manos de los
narcotraficantes).

     De estos actos han sido despedidos m s de 50 polic!as y algunos otros
sancionados con medidas disciplinarias de acuerdo con la gravedad en las
faltas.

     Dos programas se impulsaron durante los #ltimos meses para bajar el
!ndice de criminalidad que sacude el pa!s. Se trata del programa "Vecinos
Vigilantes" auspiciado por la Polic!a Nacional, y "No a las armas, si a la paz",
a cargo de la la Alcald!a del Distrito Capital, con apoyo de la Polic!a Nacional.

     El programa "Vecinos Vigilantes", pretende la organizaci"n de 25 o 30
familias para custodiar los barrios m s afectados por la delincuencia en la
capital. Cada barrio escoge una persona enlace con la estaci"n de polic!a m s
pr"xima a su barriada.  Hasta donde se tiene conocimiento, ninguno de los
"vecinos vigilantes" est  autorizado para portar armas.  Este programa es el
mismo que se realiza en Guatemala, Colombia, Argentina, Canad , Estados
Unidos y Francia.

     Por medio del programa "No a las armas, si a la paz", se han colectado m s
de 5,000 armas en poder de moradores del Barrio El Chorrillo, uno de los m s
afectados por la invasi"n militar estadounidense del 20 de diciembre de 1989.
El programa se proyecta extender a otros barrios capitalinos afectados por
la delincuencia.

     A cambio de la entrega de las armas, la Alcald!a de la ciudad de Panam 
entrega a los lugare$os, bonos que son intercambiados por alimentos y
enseres domsticos donados por dos importantes cadenas de supermercados. 
Las armas que son recolectadas sin hacer pregunta sobre su procedencia y son
destru!das en acto p#blico.

     A la par que se implementan programas para combatir la criminalidad en
todas sus formas, preocupa el incremento de abusos de los polic!as perpetrados
durante los operativos contra el hampa en los diferentes sectores del pa!s.
Aunque los mismos han sido sancionados con despidos inmediatos y en otros casos,
con severas sanciones administrativas, la falta de una ley que regule la
actuaci"n de la polic!a, sigue siendo una de las principales causas motivos de
preocupaci"n de este organismo de derechos humanos. 

     5.  En otro aspecto, contin#a el velo de la incertidumbre respecto al
tema de la renegociaci"n de las bases militares estadounidenses en Panam . 
Las conversaciones exploratorias que se iniciar!an a finales de 1995 se
suspendieron a ra!z de la resistencia interna a la permanencia de las tropas
norteamericanas y la negativa del Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos
de pagar una compensaci"n econ"mica por el uso de algunas de las bases.

     Un estudio de impacto econ"mico sobre el desalojo de las bases militares
elaborado en abril de este a$o por los economistas paname$os Marcos
Fern ndez y Jos Gal n Ponce calcul" el valor de las  reas militares en 2 mil
millones 931 mil 07 d"lares, pero estimados anteriores valoraban esas mismas
 reas en 32 mil millones de d"lares.

     Entre las recomendaciones planteadas en el estudio de impacto
econ"mico se sugiri" renegociar con Estados Unidos la Base Area de Howard,
en el Pac!fico y Sherman en el litoral Atl ntico.  Seg#n Fern ndez y Gal n a los
Estados Unidos les interesar!a retener Sherman, Howard un muelle en la Base
Naval de Rodman porque representar!an un centro internacional contra el
narcotr fico desde Amrica Latina hacia Estados Unidos a travs del istmo
centroamericano.

     Los sectores nacionalistas que nos oponemos a la permanencia de las bases
militares norteamericanas sostenemos que el cierre de las mismas y la
transferencia del Canal a Panam  dar!a la oportunidad de romper con la
dependencia de 93 a$os con los Estados Unidos, lo que permitir!a un
reforzamiento de nuestra dignidad e identidad.

     Aunado a esta aspiraci"n genuina de la lucha generacional por la devoluci"n
del Canal y la salida de las 7,600 tropas norteamericanas (seg#n cifras del
Comando Sur) que todav!a quedan en nuestro territorio, est  la responsabilidad
que le compete al gobierno norteamericano de entregar los sitios de defensa libre
de contaminaci"n dado, que en los #ltimos 70 a$os, los Estados Unidos utilizaron
el istmo paname$o como campo para la pr ctica de tiro y el almacenamiento de
material militar peligroso que representa un potencial de peligro para el uso
civil de esas instalaciones.

BASES MILITARES EXTRANJERAS 

EN
 
TERRITORIO CENTROAMERICANO



     Como paname$a que soy, pienso que cuando hablamos en esencia de lo que
es Panam , pensamos en la lucha por la soberan!a que libraron generaciones
de hombres y mujeres dando lo mejor que ten!an por construir un futuro sin
vestigios coloniales perfeccionando nuestra identidad nacional.  Esta
historia va ligada irremediablemente a la presencia de un canal y la existencia
impuesta de unas bases militares extranjeras en nuestro territorio.

     Es por esta raz"n, y a pesar de lo que se dice y se cree, que la lucha por
la soberan!a nacional forma parte del pasado en un presente neoliberal;
nosotros somos de los que creemos y as! la realidad nos lo demuestra, que lo
hist"rico y lo nacional sigue teniendo significado y sentido en el presente y
futuro de nuestros pa!ses, por lo menos en el nuestro.

     En el marco de esta concepci"n, y por no abordar con la justeza hist"rica
que estos problemas ameritan, el futuro y sus contradicciones naturales,
siempre nos retrotraen al pasado y a los problemas que siendo
trascendentales no se saldan en el devenir del tiempo, atacando las causas
que lo incuban.

     Es as! como en el d!a de hoy, la sociedad paname$a se debate en una Ley
de Amnist!a con un di logo de sordos.  Gobierno y oposici"n argumentan
posiciones desde el perd"n y olvido, hasta justicia para los m rtires de la
narcomafia de Noriega y sus secuaces.

     Ninguno lado de los bandos ha querido, en el momento que tuvieron la
posibilidad de gobernar, abordar con objetividad hist"rica y sentido de patria:
un hecho trascendental que ha marcado a la naci"n, pero que todos hoy -hablo
de las fuerzas que detentaron el poder-, se esfuerzan en olvidar: el
significado y las consecuencias que para Panam , mi pa!s, tuvo la invasi"n
norteamericana del 20 de diciembre de 1989.
     
     Ese hecho hist"rico que pocos quieren recordar, aparece en escena una
y otra vez, cuando se tratan temas de profundidad nacional.  En este caso,
cito la importancia de una ley de amnist!a y el futuro de las bases militares
norteamericanas en Panam , porque tiene que ver con el tema que quisiera
esbozar hoy con ustedes: Las bases militares extranjeras en territorio
centroamericano.

     Desde que Panam  determin" suspender en noviembre de 1995 las
conversaciones exploratorias con los Estados Unidos sobre la prolongaci"n
de bases militares norteamericanas m s all  del a$o dos mil, se ha tendido un
velo de incertidumbre respecto al tema, que ahora seg#n los norteamericanos
depende que los paname$os y el gobierno del Dr. Prez Balladares se pongan de
acuerdo sobre la conveniencia o no de llevar adelante la renegociaci"n.

     Voy a permitirme expresar algunas informaciones que son importantes
que ustedes aqu! en Centroamrica manejen sobre qu significa este proceso
de reversi"n de las bases militares a nuestro pa!s.

     Varias fueron las razones que salieron a relucir a ra!z de la decisi"n
paname$a de suspender las negociaciones.  Entre las m s importantes est n
la resistencia interna a la permanencia de las tropas norteamericanas en
Panam , y la negativa del Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos de pagar
una compensaci"n econ"mica por el uso de dichas bases.

     Seg#n fuentes en Washington, los Estados Unidos nunca pensaron pagar
alquiler por el uso de las bases en Panam .  Esa postura fue confirmada por
el embajador estadounidense en Panam , William Hughes y el Coronel Richard
OoConnor del Comando Sur.

     Existen divisiones sobre el tema de las bases militares tanto en Panam 
como en los Estados Unidos.  En mi pa!s, las encuestas est n marcando dos
fuertes tendencias encontradas sobre el futuro de las bases:  la primera para
que se queden; la segunda para que se vayan.

     Pero esta divisi"n existente sobre el tema de la renegociaci"n no s"lo
es en Panam .  El desacuerdo existe en Washington en torno al n#mero de
tropas y bases que Estados Unidos mantendr!a en mi pa!s, por los respectivos
gastos que acarrear!a el aparato militar estadounidense, teniendo en cuenta
que ese pa!s est  reduciendo sus operaciones en su propio territorio, as!
como sus bases en ultramar.

     Sobre este punto, el exjefe del Comando Sur, Barry McCaffrey, ahora
designado por el Presidente Bill Clinton, como el nuevo "zar antidrogas", abog"
por una fuerza militar de hasta cinco mil soldados, pero meses despus, en los
albores de su retiro, admiti" que unos tres mil soldados ser!an suficientes.

     Tanto en Panam  como en Washington hay mucha especulaci"n sobre el
futuro de la permanencia militar estadounidense en Panam .  Hasta ahora la
actitud de Estados Unidos es que Panam  tome la iniciativa de replantear
primero el tema de la renegociaci"n de las bases militares, lo que hace
suponer una cierta aprehensi"n de los norteamericanos de quedar expuestos
a nivel internacional como la potencia hegem"nica que presiona para lograr
dicho fin.

     Pero el Presidente Balladares sostuvo en abril de este a$o que una
negociaci"n con Estados Unidos sobre las bases, avanzar!a si Panam  obtiene
"beneficios econ"micos".

     Los sectores que nos oponemos a la permanencia de las bases,
sostenemos que el cierre de ellas y la reversi"n del Canal a Panam  dar!a la
oportunidad de romper con la dependencia de 93 a$os con los Estados Unidos,
lo que permitir!a darle un uso econ"mico en beneficio del desarrollo nacional
a mi pa!s y por supuesto, recobrar la identidad y dignidad nacional.


     EL IMPACTO DEL DESALOJO DE LAS BASES

     Actualmente los Estados Unidos mantienen en Panam  diez bases
militares: Albrook, Fuerte Amador, Fuerte Clayton, Fuerte Davis, Isla Galeta,
Base Area de Howard, Fuerte Kobbe, Quarry Heights, Base Naval Rodman y
Fuerte Sherman.

     Estudios econ"micos estiman que la contribuci"n de las bases militares
en Panam  oscila entre los 200 a 700 millones de d"lares anuales, que incluyen
salarios a los empleados y compras de bienes y servicios.

     El desalojo de las bases militares implica la salida de 10 mil soldados
norteamericanos y sus familias, proceso que se inici" hace un par de a$os.  En
la actualidad hay 7,600 militares.  En 1998, la cifra se reducir  a 5,650
soldados.

     La salida de las tropas norteamericanas conlleva el cierre de las
tiendas de barrote, restaurantes, supermercdos y almacenes, que si bien
operan dentro de las bases militres de forma restringida, emplean un n#mero
significativo de paname$os.

     Un estimado del Comando Sur indica que con el cierre de las bases
militares en Panam , la econom!a paname$a ser  impactada en 111 millones de
d"lares en los pr"ximos tres a$os.  Aunque se concuerda que este es un
proceso normal por el cierre de las bases y la reversi"n del Canal a Panam ,
ste ha sido el argumento que sostienen los que se muestran a favor de la
permanencia de los sitios de defensa.

     

     Muchos paname$os han manifestado su apoyo a la prolongaci"n de las
bases, porque consideran que al cerrarse se perder n muchos empleos que
afectar n la econom!a del pa!s.

     Otros economistas nacionales han manifestado que sobre la base de una
adecuada pol!tica econ"mica, resulta perfectamente factible absorber
cualquier impacto negativo del retiro de las bases norteamericanas, situadas
a orillas del canal.

     Los que argumentan que la reversi"n de las bases militares favorecer 
el crecimiento econ"mico, sostienen que stas deben integrarse a un plan que
incluya a toda la regi"n interoce nica y el Canal de Panam , teniendo como
meta el desarrollo nacional.

     Desde 1979, han revertido a Panam  16 mil acres de tierra (6,478
hect reas) y 405 edificios, que corresponden a un 1/5 del total de las  reas
de tierras (77,000 acres) y menos de 1/10 de los edificios (m s de 4,000) que
deber n revertir a Panam .

     Un estudio de impacto econ"mico por el cierre de las bases militares
realizado este a$o por los economistas paname$os Marcos Fern ndez y Jos
Gal n Ponce calcul" el valor de las  reas militares en 2 mil millones 931 mil 07
d"lares, pero varios estimados anteriores aseveran que el valor de las  reas
militares que revertir n a Panam  (incluyendo su canal), es de
aproximadamente treinta mil millones de d"lares.

     El estudio que analiza los beneficios y costos de la reversi"n de las
bases desde la perspectiva econ"mica no explica suficientemente el potencial
productivo a corto plazo de estas  reas y los beneficios sociales a la
poblaci"n.  Asume por el contrario, el uso mixto de estas instalaciones, en lo
militar y econ"mico.

     La evaluaci"n econ"mica elaborada por los economistas Fern ndez y
Gal n Ponce a solicitud del gobierno del Presidente Prez Balladares, estim"
que las instalaciones militares m s costosas son los Fuertes Howard con
1,187.9 millones de d"lares; Albrook con 393.8 millones de d"lares; Clayton con
302.5 millones de d"lares; y Rodman con 169.8 millones de d"lares.

     Entre las recomendaciones planteadas en el estudio se sugiri" la
renegociaci"n de la Base de Howard, en el Pac!fico y Sherman en el Atl ntico. 
Seg#n los economistas, a Estados Unidos les interesar!a retener Sherman,
Howard y un muelle en Rodman porque representar!a un centro internacional
contra el narcotr fico.

     El Fuerte Sherman, es el #nico centro de entrenamiento en selva que
mantiene Estados en el hemisferio para actividades de contrainsurgencia. 
Howard posee una gran pista de aterrizaje que se utilizar!a en la movilizaci"n
de tropas que vigilar!an y controlar!an el tr fico de drogas desde Amrica
Latina hacia Estados Unidos a travs del istmo centroamericano.

     Washington ha mostrado inters por retener no solo esas instalaciones
sino que tambin se menciona la Isla Galeta, ubicada en el Mar Caribe, donde
funciona la m s sofisticada y compleja estaci"n de comunicaciones bajo el
agua en ambos ocanos y que cuesta millones de d"lares.


     LA CONTAMINACION DE LAS BASES

     Este es uno de los aspectos quiz s m s polmicos en el proceso de
reversi"n de las instalaciones militares estadounidenses a Panam .  Las bases
militares de los Estados Unidos en Panam  presentan un potencial de peligro
para el uso civil.

     El Comando Sur sostuvo por mucho tiempo que los grados de
contaminaci"n de las bases no eran significativos, pues las sustancias
peligrosas eran b sicamente almacenadas y transportadas en las bases
militares.

     Seg#n Jaime Espinoza, paname$o, especialista en toxicolog!a, el gran
problema que confronta en cuanto a los grados de contaminaci"n en las basdes
militares es la falta de informaci"n completa sobre las actividades
espec!ficas que involucran, el uso del material peligroso, qu tipo de restos
quedaron de tales actividades y en donde se ubicaron los desechos.

     Durante un per!odo de m s de setenta a$os, los Estados Unidos han
utilizado el territorio paname$o para pr cticas de tiro, almacenamiento de
material militar, as! como el mantenimiento o reparaci"n de equipo militar y
manejo de desechos militares, actividades con un potencial de contaminaci"n.

     La limpieza no s"lo ser!a de proyectiles, sino tambin de bombas,
granadas y diversas sustancias qu!micas denominadas contaminantes, no
biodegradables que han permanecido por largos per!odos de tiempo en los
suelos, as! como en los ambientes acu ticos y areos.

     La descontaminaci"n de las bases requiere la remoci"n de todos estos
componentes para la rehabilitaci"n de estas  reas que han provocado en el
pasado da$os irreparables en los seres vivos y en el propio entorno
ambiental.

     Sobre este tema, a Estados Unidos le compete la responsabilidad de
entregar libre de contaminaci"n las tierras para que el Plan General y
Regional de Uso de Suelos las determine como aptas para la agricultura.

     Antes de que este proceso de reversi"n de las bases concluya, Panam 
debiera solicitar a Estados Unidos un estudio sobre la situaci"n ambiental
existente en las instalaciones militares, as! como de aquellas que han sido
devueltas como son Davis, Fuerte Espinar, entre otras.

     
     LOS ULTIMOS ACONTECIMIENTOS

     Durante los #ltimos meses ha crecido el rechazo sobre una posible
renegociaci"n de las bases militares.  Sectores como los obreros,
estudiantes, campesinos, ind!genas, de derechos humanos, docentes,
empresarios y dem s componentes de la sociedad civil esperan que las  reas
que faltan por revertir al medio d!a del 31 de diciembre de 1999 se encuentren
libre de toda contaminaci"n y disponibles para el desarrollo nacional como bien
lo prefiera el pueblo paname$o.

     Sin embargo, as! como sigue en la incertidumbre el inicio de las
conversaciones sobre una negociaci"n de las bases militares de Estados
Unidos, lo mismo ocurre con el famoso plan "maestro" para el uso civil de los
bienes que recibir  Panam  en Estados Unidos antes de 1999.

     Hasta ahora s"lo existen proyectos para la construcci"n de un puerto
de contenedores y una zona procesadora para la exportaci"n en el atl ntico
paname$o, as! como un parque de almacenamiento de combustible y el proyecto
universitario internacional "Ciudad del Saber" en el sector Pac!fico.

     Hace dos d!as culmin" el Encuentro Panam  2000 que convoc" a todos los
partidos pol!ticos y varias fuerzas representativas de la sociedad civil con
patrocinio de las Naciones Unidas para trazar agendas m!nimas de un traspaso
ordenado entre los paname$os del canal a nuestras manos.

     Por lo trascendente del tema, los convocados determinaron en sus
conclusiones:

     "g.  La preservaci"n del patrimonio ecol"gico de la regi"n interocanica,
como garant!a de continuidad del Canal de Panam .

     h.  La necesidad y conveniencia de celebrar encuentros a la mayor
brevedad posible, destinados a considerar:

     1.  El anteproyecto de Ley de la Autoridad del Canal de Panam .

     2.  El Plan General de Uso de Suelos y el Plan Regional de la Autoridad
de la Regi"n Interoce nica.

     3.  La conversi"n y reutilizaci"n de las bases militares".

     Los paname$os y las paname$as queremos hacer nuestro mejor esfuerzo
por alcanzar un traspaso ordenado, sin sobresaltos y precedido por unas
elecciones democr ticas con todas las observaciones internacionales
requeridas.

     Los queremos indudablemente es un desarrollo nacional sin bases
militares extranjeras en nuestro territorio.  En cuanto al canal, ya se ha
demostrado que Panam  tiene capacidad para administrarlo totalmente.

     Les demandamos a la sociedad centroamericana, nos ayuden y nos apoyen
en este salto al pr"ximo siglo que ser  una realidad al mediod!a del 31 de
diciembre de 1999.

"A masterpiece of editing and political analysis, back to back."
         -Jane Gaines Duke University

"An effective & enlightening blend of documentary & drama."
         -Edward S. Herman University of Pennsylvania

"The best documentary of the year.  All gringos should see it!"
         -Erik Barnouw Columbia University, ProfessorEmeritus

  In a meticulous compilation of excerpts from hundreds of films, The Gringo in Mananaland shows the relationship between media and history: how images of Latin America shaped and were shaped by U.S. foreign policy. Thirteen years in the making, this project grew from a data base of over 7000 films: Hollywood dramas, industrial films, home movies and educational "documentaries".  In the tradition of archival compilations, such as the work of Esther Shub in the early days of the Soviet Union or the classic compilation about nuclear war, The Atomic Cafe, The Gringo in Mananaland  distills the underlying ideology of the U.S. media to point out the cultural imperialism at work by juxtaposition and irony rather than heavy handed didactic narrative.  

THE STORY
   This film uses hundreds of videoclips to create an over-arching   narrative of the basic stereotypic trajectory from films about Latin America.  This basic story is quite obvious in the fiction films, but the ideology is apparent in the "factual" films as well.  The story line is something like this:

     *The brave gringo explorer discovers a rich and exotic land.
  
     *He eliminates the jungle and builds a "Garden of Eden"
      where natives toil happily in the fields.  

     *There are some problems with the white women in this
      paradise.They obviously don't belong here and are persuaded
      to leave with offers of tickets and money.  

     *The native women are friendly and adoring.  

     *The native men, however, are a big problem.  They don't
      like the fruit company and are unruly.  

     *Bandits and foreign influences stir them into rebellion
      which is put down by brave US Marines, with the help of 
      technological developments such as airplanes.

     *The bandits are safe in jail, where things are not so bad
      because they can still sing.

     *Everyone is grateful for US aid.

     *We are all good neighbors.

DECLARACION SOBRE EL CANAL DE
PANAMA


A LA COMUNIDAD INTERNACIONAL


     
     Con motivo de la reuni"n en Panam  de la XXVI Asamblea General de la
Organizaci"n de Estados Americanos (OEA), del 3 al 7 de junio de 1996, las
personas y organizaciones suscritas deseamos expresar nuestra posici"n

3 de junio

+++ Cancilleres de 34 naciones reunidas desde este domingo en
Panama aprobaron "El Consenso de Panama" donde se comprometieron
con la integracion y la globalizacion del continente americano.
     La aprobacion de los cancilleres se dio visperas a la
inauguracion de la XXVI reunion ordinaria de la Organizacion de
Estados Americanos (OEA) donde se debatiran 60 temas.
     Los representantes de las naciones participantes expresaron su
conviccion de que el multilateralismo, mediante la cooperacion
internacional y el dialogo politico seran el instrumento efectivo
para la realizacion de las aspiraciones comunes.
     De acuerdo a lo pactado los cancilleres exhortaron a la OEA y
a la comunidad internacional a prestar atencion a la cooperacion
tecnica que permita desarrollar programas apropiados.
     Tambien hicieron un llamado a las naciones desarrolladas a
seguir contribuyendo generosamente en los programas para liberar a
Centroamerica de las minas terrestres antipersonales.


+++  Excavaciones mineras en la provincia de Veraguas obligaran el
desalojo de sus residencias a 30 familias de escasos recursos,
segun publica este lunes el diario "La Prensa".
     Indica el rotativo que el inicio de las excavaciones mineras -
a 25 metros de las viviendas- provoco un serio conflicto entre las
familias afectadas y la compania minera.
     Agrega la nota que los moradores se han visto afectado por las
constantes explosiones de dinamitas que se realizan en las
exploraciones mineras y las sustancias toxicas utilizadas en las
canchas de lixiviacion.


+++  El asesor del presidente norteamericano, Bill Clinton, de
visita en Panama aseguro este lunes que el proceso de transicion de
la via interoceanica a manos panamenas funciona "muy bien" y
adelanto que todo marcha segun lo planeando en los tratados
Torrijos-Carter.
     Thomas McLarty dijo que las negociaciones exploratorias sobre
la permanencia de bases militares estadounidenses mas alla del ano
2,000, es un tema que entrara en "un acuerdo post-tratado" y no
afectara en nada la trasferencia del Canal.
     De acuerdo al funcionario de Washington el tema de la
renegociacion de bases es un "tema extremadamente complejo y que
debe seguirse en forma muy prudente y delicada".


4 de junio

+++  Familiares de la victimas de la invasion norteamericana del 20
de diciembre de 1989 protestaron este lunes, en las cercanias del
Centro de Convenciones ATLAPA, escenario de la Asamblea General de
la OEA, por la demora en el dictamen de los casos presentados ante
la Comision Interamericana de Derechos Humanos.
     Las acciones se llevaron en forma pacifica, pero mostrando
pancartas donde exigian tambien respeto por el despido de empleados
mediante la Ley 25 de 1990.
     Durante los sucesos el embajador de Panama en la OEA, Laurence
Fabrega, fungio como intermediario entre los afectados y la
Comision Interamericana de los Derechos Humanos (CIDH).
     

+++  Dirigentes obreros aseguraron este lunes que "pelearan en las
calles" si el gobierno nacional insiste en privatizar la Caja de
Seguro Social (CSS).
     Mariano Mena, dirigente de la Central General de Trabajadores
de Panama (CGTP), explico que ante el tema de la privatizacion de
la CSS no daran tregua y advirtio que junto a otros dirigentes
sindicales "nos prepararemos para hacer frente a la lucha".
     El modelo de privatizacion de Chile debe estar fuera de las
fronteras panamenas porque la "seguridad social no debe estar en
manos privadas", advirtio Mena.
     Senalo el dirigente que si "dejamos el servicio de atencion
medica en manos privadas va a imperar la ley de la selva".



+++  El Congreso General de la Etnia Kuna rechazo este lunes la
intencion del Ejecutivo de establecer una base naval antidrogas en 
esa comarca y calificaron la decision como "inaceptable desde todo
punto de vista".
     Segun un comunicado  de la maxima autoridad de la etnia, el
"establecer una base naval seria un mortal remedio a la enfermedad"
y nego rotundamente que el Congreso General haya solicitado al
Gobierno tal iniciativa.
     "Si bien es necesaria la proteccion del Estado ante las
incursiones de aventureros, consideramos que su equiparamiento y
capacitacion es suficiente", sostiene el comunicado.
     



5 de junio

+++  La Asamblea General de la OEA reunida en Panama rechazo este
martes la Ley Helms-Burton aprobada por el Senado norteamericano
para sancionar aquellos paises que mantengan relaciones comerciales
con Cuba al tiempo que la representante de Estados Unidos, Harriet
Babbit, califico la medida de "burdo intervencionismo".
     El rechazo de la Ley tuvo 23 votos a favor y uno en contra (el
de Estados Unidos). La iniciativa de rechazo fue propuesta por los
paises miembros del Grupo de Rio y Canada y en la votacion 10
paises no estuvieron presentes.
     La aprobacion conlleva que la ley sea sometida a una consulta
del Comite Juridico Interamericano de la OEA para determinar su
legalidad.
     En tanto, la representante de Estados Unidos se mostro
inconforme y cuestiono a los demas miembros por su cobardia para la
aprobacion del texto.
     "No les da verguenza a ciertos paises denunciar con tanta
fuerza una ley interna y luego carecer del coraje moral y politico
para denunciar una dictadura totalitaria", afirmo Babbit.
     Cancilleres que votaron en favor del proyecto coincidieron en
senalar que la Ley Helms-Burton representa una clara violacion al
derecho internacional.


+++  Al menos 4 personas muertas y otras 15 resultaron heridas
luego de una reyerta este martes entre bandas rivales en la
penitenciaria Monte Esperanza en la provincia de Colon, en el
atlantico panameno.
     La reyerta provoco que los reclusos destruyeran las celdas y
utilizaran sus varillas como armas de defensa contra sus rivales.
     Informaciones locales revelan que uno de los reos arrebato las
llaves de seguridad a un custodio y abrio las celdas para agredir
a sus companeros.
     Familiares de los detenidos intentaron conocer versiones
oficiales del suceso, pero la Direccion del Centro Penitenciario
impidio su entrada.


+++  La Iglesia Catolica panamena solicitara al gobierno de Estados
Unidos el acceso a la informacion del caso de un sacerdote
colombiano desaparecido en junio de 1971.
     Una fuente de la Iglesia Catolica senalo al diario "La Prensa"
que existen informes sobre la existencia de archivos de
inteligencia norteamericana que contienen detalles de captura del
padre Hector Gallegos por parte de las exunidades del G-2 de las
exFuerzas de Defensa.
     Segun la fuente existen publicaciones del diario "New York
Times" y de la revista "Life" que afirman que la inteligencia
norteamericana intercepto una conversacion del General (R) Manuel
Antonio Noriega cuando iba a bordo del helicoptero que arrojo al
mar al sacerdote.
     


     El juicio sobre la desaparicion del religioso se verifico en
octubre de 1993 encontrandose culpable a tres exmiembros del
antiguo ejercito panameno.


6 de junio

+++  El Congreso Universal del Canal de Panama, previsto para
realizarse en setiembre del proximo ano, recibio este miercoles el
respaldo de las naciones miembras de la Organizacion de Estados
Americanos.
     La iniciativa panamena fue aprobada por aclamacion en la
sesion plenaria de la XXVI Asamblea General de la OEA reunida en
Panama desde el pasado lunes.
     El Congreso pretende reunir a la comunidad maritima
internacional y a gobiernos vinculados al uso de la via
interoceanica para compartir con Panama las tareas en pro de su
modernizacion.
     Entre los temas que se debatiran destacan la relacion con el
funcionamiento; administracion y operacion del Canal, y los
problemas y retos del futuro.
     Segun el tratado Torrijos-Carter, firmado en setiembre de 1977
entre Estados Unidos y Panama, la entrega del Canal a manos
panamenas se verficara el 31 de diciembre de 1999.


+++  Protestas contra el desempleo realizaron este miercoles en
Colon ciudadanos de esta provincia, mientras otro grupo exigian
respuestas ante la reyerta carcelaria en la carcel Nueva Esperanza.
     La manifestacion liderizada por el grupo "Reaccion 3" intento
recibir respuesta de sus exigencias ante el gobernador de la
provincia, Samuel Delgado, pero este rechazo atender a los
sublevados.
     Los manifestantes reaccionaron lanzando piedras contra la
Gobernacion, provocaron que miembros de la Policia Nacional
lanzaran gases lacrimogenos y perdigones para calmar las tensiones.
     "Reaccion 3" exige al gobierno central la creacion de un plan
de emergencia para resolver el desempleo en la provincia de Colon.
Tres miembros del grupo fueron detenidos y trasladados a una
penitenciaria.


+++  Desde Washington se informo que cerca de 4,000 soldados
norteamericanos del Comando Sur acantonados en Panama permanceran
mas alla del ano 2,000, pero que su cifra no es definitiva.
     Informacion publicada este jueves en el rotativo "La Estrella
de Panama" afirma que el General John Sheehan, jefe del Comando Sur
del Atlantico de Estados Unidos, dijo que a pesar que la cifra de 
soldados "no es definitiva si es la que manejan ambos paises"
(Panama y Estados Unidos).
     Las conversaciones exploratorias sobre la permanencia de bases
militares entre ambas naciones fueron suspendidas en octubre de
1995 y tampoco se ha escuchado formalmente el reinicio de las
mismas.


7 de junio

+++  El presidente de la Republica, Ernesto Perez Balladares, dejo
entrever este jueves la posibilidad de la permanencia de militares
norteamericanos en Panama mas del ano 2,000, pero nego la
existencia de algun acuerdo.
     Explico que la posible permamencia de soldados del Comando Sur
tendria como finalidad "el desarrollo de un proyecto contra el
narcotrafico y el lavado de dinero".
     Frente a las declaraciones del General John Sheedan que
afirman la permanencia de cerca de 4,000 soldados del Comando Sur
en Panama Perez Balladares sostuvo que "no existe ningun acuerdo y
solamente seguimos explorando diferentes posibilidades".
     El jefe del Ejecutivo panameno tambien afirmo que "en las
conversaciones exploratorias no tengo ningun anuncio y se continuan
con ellas".


+++  Autoridades de la etnia ngobe-bugle solicitaron en una nota
dirigida al mandatario de la nacion que se agilice el proyecto de
ley sobre la creacion de la comarca indigena.
     El presidente del Congreso Regional de la provincia de Bocas
del Toro, Ausencio Palacios, explico en nota al Presidente  Perez
Balladares la creacion en la Asamblea Legislativa de una Comision
de Asuntos Indigenas.
     Tambien solicitan la finalizacion del proyecto de la etnia
para las provincias de Bocas del Toro, Veraguas y Chiriqui
financiado por la Agencia Interamericana de Desarrollo (AID) y el
Banco Mundial.


+++  La Comision Interamericana de Derechos Humanos de la
Organizacion de Estados Americanos (OEA) obvio este jueves la
presentacion de violacion de derechos humanos pais por pais y en su
lugar presento un informe general de presuntos casos de violaciones
de derechos a la vida y a la integridad fisica de las personas.
     La accion de la Comision causo indignacion entre organismos
nacionales e internacionales de Derechos Humanos y paises miembros
que catalogaron la accion como lamentable.
     En su informe anual la Comision indico que se abrieron 140
nuevos casos de presuntas violaciones de derechos humanos entre el
21 de enero de 1995 y el 20 de enero de 1996.
     El presidente de la Comision, Claudio Grossman, senalo que el
incremento en los casos de denuncias refleja la democracia que se
vive en paises miembros del continente americano donde no existe
temor de hacer denuncia publica.
     Por su parte Amnistia Internacional en un comunicado de prensa
afirmo que la situacion de los derechos humanos en los paises no
puede ser omitido, a pesar de que exista un sistema de gobierno
democratico.

Alabama State Senator Charles Davidson, a Republican candidate
for the United States House of Representatives, defends slavery
as God's will, citing the Bible (Leviticus:  "You may acquire
male and female slaves from the pagan nations that are around
you").  In a speech he said:  "People who are bitter and hateful
about slavery are obviously bitter and hateful against God and
his word, because they reject what God says and embrace what mere
humans say concerning slavery...This humanistic thinking is what
the abolitionists embraced."

      AFGHANISTAN: HUMANITARIAN AID FINALLY GETS THROUGH

In late May 1996, the International Committee of the Red Cross
was able to bring a relief convoy, the first since April 1994,
down from the northern town of Mazar-i-Sharif to the war-torn
capital city of Kabul. This involved driving five lorries loaded
with 75 tonnes of vegetable oil (an essential cooking ingredient
in Afghanistan as in most of Southern Asia) across the Hindu Kush
mountains; the route included the notorious Salang Pass tunnel
which, at close to three thousand metres above sea level, is one
of the highest in the world. Apart from the fact that until then
the Salang road had been closed by a particularly active front
line, a 2.4 km stretch of the road was known to be mined. In a
gesture of humanitarian concern both the Kabul authorities and
the Jumbesh, the political militia based in the northern part of
the country, agreed to let this section of the front be cleared
of mines.

The mine-removal operation was carried out by Afghan specialists 
recruited and trained by the British-based Halo Trust
organization. As an additional gesture of goodwill, both parties
allowed 60 civilians to cross the front line in the wake of the
convoy as it returned north laden with orthopaedic equipment to
manufacture prostheses for landmine victims there.

Apart from seeing an additional overland lifeline opened up for
the one million inhabitants of Kabul, the ICRC staff accompanying
the convoy were surprised and encouraged by the spontaneous
reaction from local people along the route. "People came up
waving flags and cheering us on", said Jean-Paul Jacquod, head of
sub-delegation in Mazar-i-Sharif. "We really had the impression
that more than a convoy had got through that time... we feel we
saw the emergence of a renewed feeling of hope."

                  DANGEROUS COMPUTER VIRUSES

PAT BUCHANAN VIRUS: Your system works fine, but it complains
loudly about foreign software; inexplicably defends slavery and
laughs like a wounded animal.

O.J. SIMPSON VIRUS: You know it's guilty but your anti-virus
program is too stupid to understand the scientific evidence.

NEWT GINGRICH VIRUS: It divorced it's wife virus on her cancer
bed, failed to pay child-support, and now lectures your system
about "family values."

BOB DOLE VIRUS: Could be virulent, but it's so old you secretly
hope it will self-destruct, because you really don't want to
support the Bill Clinton virus.

BILL CLINTON VIRUS:  Perceived as being liberal (but not by
liberals).  This virus will tell you what you want to hear and
then do the opposite.  It apparently is sociopathic...doing
whatever it takes to replicate itself.

BORIS YELTSIN VIRUS:  Erratic to the point of appearing drunk. 
This virus cloaks itself in the image of democracy but actually

       EXPLOSION AND FIRE AT POINT BEACH NUCLEAR PLANT

Loading of spent nuclear fuel into dry storage containers was
suspended at the Point Beach, Wisconsin, USA  Nuclear Plant
following an explosion during a welding procedure May 28, 1996. 
According to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) initial report, at 2:45 am on May 28th, an unidentified gas
ignited inside a fully-loaded cask of nuclear waste containing 14
tons of spent fuel rods, causing an explosion.  The explosion
occurred just prior to the welding of the 9 inch thick cask lid
that weighs about 4,400 pounds.  The explosion inside the cask
lifted the 2 ton lid, leaving it tipped at an angle with one edge
1 inch higher than normal.  There were no injuries.

The NRC has suspended further loading of nuclear waste casks
until it can determine the cause of the accident and whether any
spent fuel rods were damaged by the explosion.  Each 18 foot high
cask is loaded with 14 tons of radioactive waste, including 170
pounds of plutonium.  Each loaded silo contains the equivalent
radioactivity of 240 Hiroshima-type explosions.  According to
U.S. guidelines, the waste must be kept safe for 10,000 years.

The explosion confirms environmental groups' concerns that the
VSC-24 dry cask storage system has not been sufficiently reviewed
to protect public health and the environment.  This radioactive
waste storage explosion demonstrates the real threat to the Great
Lakes ecosystem.

      STREET CHILDREN MURDERED IN GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS

WITNESS, a project of the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights
provides the following report.
nyc@lchr.org
<a href=http://witness.org>http://witness.org</a>

According to Casa Alianza, street children are being kidnaped,
tortured, jailed, and murdered in Guatemala and Honduras. These
unconscionable crimes are seemingly condoned by the state
governments.  The following was taken from Casa Alianza's recent
report on street children: 

GUATEMALA: 

In Guatemala, the major perpetrators torturing and murdering
street children are uniformed officers of the Guatemala
security forces and the national police.  These street children,
parentless, homeless, often resorting to prostitution or theft,
are easy targets. Bodies of murdered children are found with
grotesque wounds created by unspeakable tortures. 

The tragic case of Nahaman Carmon Lopez is typical of the plight
of the defenseless street children. Late one night, a group of 10
street children were standing on a street corner sniffing glue --
something street children often do to forget their hunger and the
cold. Shortly after midnight four uniformed National Policemen
passing by noticed the children. One pulled out his gun and
ordered the children to stay where they were. Six escaped, four
did not. Nahaman was one of these unlucky four. The policemen
tortured the children by pouring the bags of plastic glue, toxic
liquid, over the heads and into the eyes of the children.
Nahaman, who was the eldest child at 13, tried to resist. Nahaman
was beaten by the four policeman and left lying on the street.
Nahaman was taken to a hospital by the other children.  Despite
the doctors' efforts, Nahaman died ten days later with 6 broken
ribs, bruising over 60% of his body, and a ruptured liver. 

The older children are also defenseless against these attacks. A
group of boys aged 15-20 were picked up in a parking lot by four
armed members of the National Police in a truck. They were
handcuffed and taken away.  Several days later their mutilated
bodies were found in a remote area outside Guatemala City. Their
eyes had been burned out, their ears and tongues were severed,
and some of the boys' bodies revealed burns created by boiling
liquid having been poured over their body parts. Each of the boys
had ultimately died by a shot to the back of the head. Casa
Alianza tried to sue the policeman involved in Guatemalan courts.
There was very damaging evidence to convict the policemen,
including evidence that the deadly bullets had been fired from
the guns of two of the National Policemen, but the Judge trying
the case did not admit this evidence. The four policeman were
found not guilty. Casa Alianza appealed this case to the
Guatemalan Supreme Court, but the decision was not reversed. In
the fall of 1995, Casa Alianza submitted pictorial evidence of
the boys' bodies to the United Nations Committee Against Torture,
and to the Inter American Commission of Human Rights (IAHR). The
case is presently being investigated by the IAHR. 

HONDURAS:

In contravention of the Honduran Constitution and international
law, minors are being kept in prisons with adult prisoners in
Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, Honduras. These children are easy
targets of older adult prisoners. Two boys named Geovanny
Fransisco Jako ?) and his brother Carlos Enrique (also 17) were
arrested. No charges were laid, and there was no conviction. The
boys had been living with their mother. They were taken to a San
Pedro prison in the small town of Choloma, and were held together
with adult male prisoners who had been convicted of rape, murder
and theft. 

Geovanny and his brother Carlos witnessed the physical and sexual
abuse of other boys by the adult male prisoners. Both brothers
were stabbed by an adult male prisoner, referred to as El Chino
Machete, during a verbal argument. Carlos died later that day as
a result of the stab wound. Three days later, Geovanny was
released. 

Geovanny is now 19. He is back at home with his mother and is
struggling to support them. He told Bruce Harris of Casa Alianza:
"I miss my brother.  And it's even harder now...how can I earn
myself what the two of us used to earn together?" 

CASA ALIANZA:

Casa Alianza is working to bring the murderers of hundreds of
street children to justice. They use their Witness cameras to
document evidence and testimonies. They then submit this
videotaped evidence to national courts, and international bodies
like the U.N. Committee Against Torture and the Inter American
Commission Against Human Rights. 

Through their shelters and their work programs for street
children, Casa Alianza has helped thousands of street children in
Guatemala. Casa Alianza is using its Witness camera to record the
construction of new prisons in Honduras and is investigating the
torture of children illegally jailed with adults in the Honduran
Comayaguan jail in November 1995. 


Casa Alianza asks that you please consider writing a letter to
help protect street children. Here is a sample letter: 

URGENT ACTION 

Lic. Alvaro Arzu
President of the Republic of Guatemala
Palacio Nacional
Cd de Guatemala, Guatemala
Central America

Dear President Arzu:

For the past six years, dozens of homeless street children have
been hunted down, beaten, often tortured and many murdered. The
principal perpetrators of these shameful acts have been uniformed
members of the National Police. 

In June 1990, two National Policemen illegally kidnaped, tortured
and then murdered four street children in Guatemala City. They
later killed yet another boy -- shooting him in the back. Despite
irrefutable evidence, the two policemen were released by the
courts. This case is now before the InterAmerican Commission of
Human Rights, part of the Organization of American States. 

I would like to insist upon your ordering an immediate
investigation into the torture and murder of street children by
the National Police and to prosecute the perpetrators to the full
extent of the law. I recognize that most of these attacks against
the children have not been committed during your Presidency, but
now that you have assumed such a position, I believe that it is
your responsibility to investigate, prosecute and condemn those
responsible for these hideous acts. 

Yours sincerely, 

YOUR NAME

         FEMINIZATION OF POWER IN FRANCE AND INDIA

On June 6th, 1996, ten women politicians in France launched a 
feminization of power campaign to increase the number of women in
politics through a constitutional amendment. Only 5.5 percent
France's National Assembly and 5.6 of its Senate (upper house)
are made up of women. While parliaments in 54 European nations
and North America had an average of 16 percent of seats
occupied by women in 1985, that number fell to 11 percent in
1994. Last May, French Prime Minister Alain Juppe named a record
12 women to his cabinet but later dismissed eight because he
said they lacked political clout. Juppe said he would consider
the idea of a national referendum on a constitutional revision,
but noted that the "Equality Watch" he set up last year was
studying the issue. 

A recent opinion poll conducted for the weekly L'Express, which
also published the women politicians announcement, found that the
French people overwhelmingly support gender equity, with 77
percent in favor of rewriting the constitution to add the
principle of gender equity in politics and 82 percent in favor of
a national referendum to achieve political equality. Seventy-one
percent felt equality in general society would be aided by
equality in politics. 

In India June 5th, 1996, the new coalition government said it
would reserve one third of all Parliament seats and a third of
all government jobs for women. It also announced it would review
laws to remove discrimination against women.

BOLETIN DE PRENSA

DESALOJO DE CAMPESINOS
DEL ACHIOTE

SAN JOSE, 28 DE MAYO DE 1996


IPRE9613

Actualizacio'n del boleti'n de prensa ipre9612


Ante la Comisio'n Costarricense de Derechos Humanos (CODEHU),
varios campesinos del ACHIOTE (Puerto  Viejo, Sarapiqui') denun-
ciaron que fueron desalojados por miembros del Comando
Atla'ntico, a cargo del Coronel Walter Monge. El desalojo
administrativo se llevo' a cabo del 8 al 11 de mayo.  Ellos
reciben la gui'a espiritual de la Iglesia Luterana de Costa Rica.

Los campesinos habitan desde hace ma's de un an~o una finca
conocida por el nombre de "Dieciocho de Abril S.A.". La cual
aparentemente no se encuentra inscrita en el Registro Pu'blico y
u'nicamente se conoce un documento de compra-venta. En la finca
habitan 46 familias, cerca de 150 personas, incluyendo mujeres y
nin~os. Ellos ocupan un a'rea de 450 hecta'reas, aproximadamente
10 hecta'reas por familia.

Segu'n la denuncia presentada a CODEHU la orden de desalojo se
dio hace 22 di'as, en donde se les daba 24 hora para desalojar.
En ese momento se presento' un recurso de amparo ante la Sala IV,
al cual se le dio curso por dicho tribunal, anulando las acciones
administrativas de desalojo. Dicho recurso es declarado sin
lugar, por lo que el Comando Atla'ntico, procede al desalojo el
di'a 8 de mayo, sin notificar a las familias campesinas y con la
misma orden de hace 22 di'as.

El desalojo en cuestio'n resulta ser improcedente puesto que los
campesinos, que reclaman las tierras, procedieron a imponer un
Interdicto de Amparo de Posesio'n Agraria, ante el Juzgado
Agrario de Pococi', con expediente administrativo nu'mero 107-95.
Se esta' en presencia de un conflicto de posesio'n agraria, para
el cual existe una ley que procura resolver estas situaciones.

Los campesinos manifiestan que los polici'as arrasaron sus
sembrados, destruido sus sacos de frijoles y quemado sus casas.
Tambie'n, han utilizado una draga para tirar las casas. Afirman
adema's, que colocaron banderas de Costa Rica en sus casas para
evitar la destruccio'n de las mismas, pero los polici'a tiraron
gasolina a las banderas y las quemaron. Por otra parte, se
informo' que las autoridades policiales no registraron los bienes
que destruyeron a los campesinos, con lo cual se dificulta el
cobro de la indemnizacio'n y se destruyen las pruebas de la pose-
sio'n agraria; no obstante, en conversacio'n tenida por funcio-
narios de CODEHU con la Departamento Legal del Ministerio de
Seguridad, se aseguro' que se pediri'a al Comando Atla'ntico
registrar los bienes, accio'n que no se ejecuto'.

Preocupa a CODEHU que una vez que la polici'a se retiro' un grupo
de polici'a privada, aparentemente el grupo ASEVIA, ocupo' las
tierras. En esta zona la polici'a privada realizo' desalojos y
amenazo' de muerte a un dirigente campesino del asentamiento La
Mufla.

Posterior al desalojo, la empresa -que lleva el mismo nombre de
la finca- precedio' a poner una acusacio'n penal por usurpacio'n
contra los campesinos. A partir de la cual, la Alcaldesa de
Puerto Viejo, Licda. Patricia Cubero, ordeno' al Comando del
Atla'ntico, el 21 de mayo del corriente, trasladar por la fuerza
a los campesinos imputados por la empresa, a fin de tomar las
declaraciones en Puerto Viejo. Mientras la mayori'a de los
hombres se encontraban en Puerto Viejo, las mujeres, entre las
cuales se encuentran migrantes, fueron hostigadas sexualmente por
algunos polici'as del Comando Atla'ntico. Adema's, se quemaron
casas por parte de peones contratados por la empresa y amparados
por la polici'a pu'blica.

Varias familias han denunciado que constantemente son
amedrentadas por efectivos del Comando Atla'ntico y por la empre-
sa. En este sentido los oficiales amenazan con nuevos desalojos a
las familias campesinas, lo que las mantiene en constante zozo-
bra.

A rai'z de la situacio'n descrita, los campesinos interpusieron
un recurso de amparo, asi' como una accio'n de inconstituciona-
lidad ante la Sala IV y una demanda ante lo contencioso adminis-
trativo, las cuales aun no han sido resueltos.

CODEHU condena estas acciones pues no procede el desalojo
administrativo ya que los campesinos tienen ma's de un an~o de
posesio'n, por lo tanto, procede el Interdicto de Posesio'n Agra-
ria. A su vez, los supuestos propietarios no tienen ti'tulo de
propiedad que permitan justificar el procedimiento administrati-
vo.

CODEHU demanda al Ministro de Seguridad una investigacio'n del
caso y que se apliquen las sanciones debidas a los autores de tan
lamentable hecho. Asimismo, reclama la indemnizacio'n de los
bienes destruidos.

Los campesinos hacen un llamado para que el conflicto de
posesio'n agraria sea resulto en forma paci'fica y siguiendo los
procedimiento legales vigentes. Tambie'n, claman porque se les
permita trabajar las tierras ociosas, contribuyendo de esta forma
a la produccio'n nacional y al soste'n de sus familias.

VIOLENTO DESALOJO DE CAMPESINOS
DEL ACHIOTE

SAN JOSE, 31 DE MAYO DE 1996

IPRE9615

La Comisio'n Costarricense de Derechos Humanos (CODEHU) condena
ene'rgicamente la actuacio'n del Comando Atla'ntico, a cargo del
Coronel Walter Monge, en el desalojo de los campesinos del
Achiote, en el que resultaron heridas tres personas, una de ellas
en estado de gravedad.

CODEHU realizo' una inspeccio'n en el lugar de los hechos el di'a
de ayer (jueves 30 de mayo), en compan~i'a de la Iglesia Luterana
Costarricense. En esta visita se entrevisto' al Ejecutivo
Municipal sen~or Rafael Angel Murillo Murillo, y al coronel
Walter Monge. Adema's, se recogieron testimonios de los (las)
campesinos (as) afectados (as) por el desalojo.

Este desalojo es uno de los muchos que se han realizando en la
zona; junto con amedrentamientos, amenazas y otras acciones
violatorias a los derechos humanos, por parte de efectivos de la
polici'a pu'blica y privada, segu'n denuncian los campesinos. 

El actual desalojo es ordenado por la Municipalidad de
Sarapiqui', segu'n el oficio' del 27 de mayo de 1996. El cual
ordena desalojar de las familias que se encuentran ubicadas en el
camino a San Julia'n, el Achiote. A criterio del Ejecutivo
Municipal, dicha orden se da porque hay una denuncia de los
vecinos, a quienes en el momento de la entrevista no puedo
identificar. Al parecer el desalojo se lleva a cabo en forma
irregular, violando el debido proceso, a saber: no se logro'
verificar con el Ejecutivo Municipal si hubo una inspeccio'n
ocular de las acusaciones de los vecinos, ni una comunicacio'n
previa a los campesinos de que se iba a realizar el desalojo por
parte de la Municipalidad.

Segu'n, nos informaron los campesinos, los efectivos del Comando
Atla'ntico llegaron al lugar sin mostrarles la orden de desalojo
y sin haber sido notificados con anterioridad.

Las familias campesinas habi'an sido desalojadas en di'as ante-
riores, por lo cual las familias sin tener donde ir, ni
refugiarse se encontraban al aire libre.

Los testimonios de diversas personas afirman que adema's de los
efectivos del Comando Atla'ntico, en el lugar, en el momento del
desalojo, se encontraban efectivos de la polici'a privada ASEVIA,
quienes se escontraban ubicados detra's de la polici'a pu'blica.
Aunque, segu'n versiones de algunos campesinos, ellos no
participaron en los hechos. Sin embargo, CODEHU confirmo' que una
vez que la polici'a pu'blica realizo' el desalojo, la polici'a
privada tomo' posesio'n de la finca. Estos polici'as segu'n
constatamos incumpli'an la legislacio'n que regula la polici'a
privada, en tanto que, no portaban el uniforme de reglamento.

Los campesinos afirmaron que los efectivos del Comando Atla'ntico
tiraron gases lacrimo'genos en direccio'n horizontal y no hacia
al aire, y dispararon ra'fagas de balas no en sen~al de
advertencia sino a sus cuerpos. Posterior al desalojo el sen~or
Albin Cambronero fue golpeado a patadas, recibio' un culatazo en
la boca que le quebro' un diente, y le dispararon rafagas de
balas, por parte de efectivos del Comando Atla'ntico, a e'l se le
practico' un examen me'dico.

Un grupo de 8 mujeres y 4 nin~os fueron obligadas a subir a un
autobu's policial y trasladas a la Comandancia de Puerto Viejo,
sin razo'n alguna. Ellas fueron dejadas en libertad y tuvieron
que viajar por sus propios medios en busca de sus familiares.

Segu'n el Coronel Monge al lugar se hicieron presentes 80
efectivos policiales, de diferentes lugares de la Zona.

Informes obtenidos de la Cruz Roja de Puerto Viejo, sen~alaron
que tres personas fueron trasladados a diferentes centros hospi-
talarios. Entre ellas se encuentran el sen~or Juan Victor Victor
quien recibio' un impacto de bala en el lado izquierdo del abdo-
men, en la madrugada del di'a de hoy fue trasladado al Hospital
Caldero'n Guardia, puesto que el estado de salud del sen~or Juan
Victor es grave.

Otra de las personas heridas es el sen~or Rene' Rojas Ferrogino,
de 24 an~os de edad, de nacionalidad nicaraguense, quien no forma
parte del grupo de precaristas, segu'n se nos informo', y que se
encontraba de visita en el lugar. El recibio' un impacto de bala
en el tobillo,  presentando una factura en la pierna, se
encuentra fuera de peligro.

El sen~or Dennis Zambrana, de 22 an~os de edad, fue dado de alta,
pues solo presentaba heridas leves en un brazo y otras partes del
cuerpo causadas por perdigones.

CODEHU reitera su posicio'n de que el desalojo es arbitrario pues
existen procesos judiciales pendientes, como ya lo informamos en
el comunicado de prensa IPRE9613; asi' como por la falta de
intervencio'n del Instituto de Dedarrollo Agrario (IDA). CODEHU
demanda que se detengan todas las acciones violentas contra los
campesinos hasta que resuelva la accio'n judicial.

Adema's, solicita al sen~or Ministro de Seguridad que se
investigue la actuacio'n policial del Comando Atla'ntico en los
hechos descritos y se sen~alen las responsabilidades correspon-
diente, sobre todo al encontrarse en peligro la vida de Juan
Victor Victor.

CODEHU considera importante que el IDA intervenga en el conflicto
para buscar una solucio'n al problema de tierras de los
campesinos del ACHIOTE, para que el mismo se resuelva en forma
paci'fica y democra'tica; todo en los te'rminos de la legisla-
cio'n agraria, fundamentalmente el arti'culo 144 de la Ley de
Tierras y Colonizacio'n.

CODEHU ANTE LA COMPRA DE ARMAS

SAN JOSE, 30 DE MAYO DE 1996

IPRE9614

La Comisio'n Costarricense de Derechos Humanos (CODEHU considera
inoportuno la compra de armas a la Industria Militar Israeli',
por la suma de 1.076 millones, por cuanto:

1. La declaratoria de Secreto de Estado, por Decreto Ejecutivo Nx
25127, limita el acceso a la informacio'n de los ciudadanos en
materia tan delicada como la compra de armas.

2. Se ignora el tipo de armas que se van adquirir, aspecto que
conduce a la duda de si las armas son de tipo ofensiva o defensi-
va.

3. Se desconoce el uso que se le dari'a a las armas, pues aunque
se afirma que son para combatir el narcotra'fico, nada asegura
que no se utilicen para reprimir los movimientos de defensa de
los derechos de la ciudadani'a.

4. No se dio a conocer un estudio te'cnico del estado del Arsenal
Nacional, ni las necesidades de adquisicio'n de armas.

5. La falta de claridad en el mecanismo que se debe seguir para
la compra de armas pone en duda la legalidad del procedimiento
que lleva a cabo el Poder Ejecutivo.

6. Por u'ltimo, no queda claro en que' sentido la seguridad
interna de Costa Rica esta' en peligro si se dan a conocer los
registros y los expedientes de adquisio'n de armas, cuando el
pai's no se encuentra en una situacio'n  li'mite o inminente de
colapso de la institucionalidad.


En este sentido para CODEHU es incomprensible que un pai's como
Costa Rica, que abolio' el eje'rcito, y ostenta ser paci'fico y
altamente democra'tico, se declare la compra de armas como un
secreto de Estado. Aludiendo que dar a conocer este tipo de
informacio'n transciende los li'mites de la libertad, puesto que
se pone sobre aviso al narcotra'fico y la delincuencia organiza-
da.

Por lo tanto, CODEHU apoya las gestiones realizas por los diputa-
dos del PUSC ante la Sala IV. CODEHU coincide con las declaracio-
nes del expresidente de la Repu'blica, sen~or Oscar Arias, sobre
peligro de las "anomali'as autoritarias" de los cuerpos policia-
les y con el diputado Rodrigo Gutie'rrez en cuanto a la necesidad
de reglamentar del Secreto de Estado. Asimismo, es indispensable
que la Asamblea Legislativa, esclarezca y regule los mecanismos
para la compras de armas.

AMENAZAS Y HOSTIGAMIENTO 
A DIRIGENTES DE RIO AZUL


SAN JOSE, 5 DE JUNIO DE 1995

IPRE9617


La Comisio'n Costarricense de Derechos Humanos (CODEHU) en
compan~i'a del diputado Rodrigo Gutie'rrez, realizo' una visita a
la Comunidad de Ri'o Azul, el di'a mie'rcoles 29 de mayo del
corriente, con el propo'sito de tomar denuncias a los dirigentes
del Comite' Ci'vico Interdistrital por hostigamiento policial.

Los dirigentes del Comite' Ci'vico, sen~ora Ana Luci'a Montoya
Gamboa, maestra de escuela, Guiselle Arce, ama de casa y el
sen~or Germa'n Lobo manifestaron que aproximadamente desde an~o y
medio sufren de hostigamiento policial, amenazas de muerte,
secuestro, e intervenciones telefo'nicas por parte de individuos
no identificados, pero que se sospecha son agentes de la
Direccio'n de Inteligencia y Seguridad (DIS).

Segu'n la sen~or Montoya Gamboa, desde el an~o 1995 es seguida
por carros no identificados; asi', en una ocasio'n que la siguio'
un automovil, un individuo no identificado le pidio' que baja del
automo'vil en que viajaba, mientras ella hacia el alto en un
sema'foro,. Tambie'n, afirma que en diferentes momentos le han
golpeado las ventanas de automo'vil.

La sen~ora Montoya identifica tres automo'viles que realizan las
acciones, todos ellos sin placas, a saber: un Toyota Tercel de
color blanco, un Toyota tipo heep de color verde y un Honda de
color azul. Sospecha que las personas que la siguen son agentes
de la DIS pues en otro momento cuando fue seguida identifico' a
un carro de la DIS, al parecer con placa Nx 16211.

Tambie'n, afirma la sen~ora Montoya que los dirigentes del
Comite' Ci'vico reciben constantemente llamadas telefo'nicas en
las que se les amenazas de muerte si no se retiran del movi-
miento. 

Por otra parte, Ana Luci'a Montoya dice que existe una grabacio'n
en un diario nacional en la cual se les intenta vincular con el
terrorismo internacional, este medio de comunicacio'n
aparentemente tiene los nombres de las personas que hicieron la
acusacio'n.

Segu'n el testimonio de la sen~ora Arce, de 40 an~os de edad,
vecina de San Antonio, Desamparados, Calle Curuca, confirma las
declaraciones dadas por Ana Luci'a. Enfatiza la sen~ora Arce que
la persecucio'n se incrementa en el mes de marzo cuando se
intenta cerrar el relleno sanitario por parte de los vecinos. La
hija de Arce, una nin~a de ocho an~os, recibio' una llamada que
realizo' un hombre que se identifico' como Alberto Marti'nez,
quien afirmo' ser de Seguridad Nacional y pregunto' si estaba su
mama'.

El 12 de mayo de 1995 el sen~or Germa'n Lobo fue detenido sin
razo'n alguna por cuatro agentes del Centro de Informacio'n Poli-
cial (CIP) y fue llevado a los Tribunales de Justicia, acusado
del robo de un vehi'culo, el cual asevera Lobo es de su
propiedad. Unos di'as antes del hecho varios agentes llegaron a
su casa a solicitarle que detuviera el movimiento de protesta de
los vecinos. A partir de ese momento ha recibido constantemente
amenazas de muerte, la cuales se llevan a cabo en forma ano'nima.
Una de las amenazas (expresada oralmente) dice: "Mira hijo de tal
el an~o pasado te secuestramos este vez vas a parecer panza
arriba en un hueco en el Zurqui'". 

Adema's, el sen~or Juan Bosco Vargas ha recibido amenazas; y el
sen~or Rodolfo Quesada, cuando estaba en una reunio'n le avisaron
que fuera a su casa porque habi'an recibido una llamada
telefo'nica diciendo que se la iban a incendiar.

CODEHU ve con suma preocupacio'n que este tipo de acciones,
ti'pica de pai'ses con una gran trayectoria de represio'n
policial y militar a la poblacio'n civil y en particular a los
activistas de derechos humanos y comunales se este'n dando en el
pai's. 

CODEHU considera primordial investigar y aclarar los hechos
descritos anteriormente, por lo que solicita al sen~or Presidente
de la Repu'blica y al sen~or Ministro de la Presidencia
(instancia a la que se adscribe la DIS y que esta' en la
obligacio'n por la Ley General de Polici'a de fiscalizar a dicho
cuerpo policial) para que investigue si existe alguna una
participacio'n de la DIS o de algu'n otro grupo en las acciones
denunciadas.

CODEHU debido a la gravedad de las denuncias realiza una accio'n
preventiva internacional para velar por la seguridad de los
dirigentes comunales del Comite' Ci'vico Interdistrital, por lo
cual presento' denuncia ante la Comisio'n Centroamericana para la
Defensa de los Derechos Humanos (CODEHUCA) y Amnisti'a
Internacional.

Victimas panamenas de la invasion estadounidense de 1989 reclaman justicia ante 
la O.E.A., en su XXVI Asamblea General


Sheila I. Velez Martinez
Jose Juan Nazario de la Rosa*
_____________________________________________________________________________

--El territorio de un estado es inviolable; no sera objeto, aun temporalmente, 
de ocupacion militar u otra medida de fuerza tomada por otro estado, directa o 
indirectamente, bajo ningun fundamento.--

Articulo 20, Carta de la Organizacion de Estados Americanos
_____________________________________________________________________________

El 20 de diciembre de 1989 a media noche el ejercito de los Estados Unidos 
invadio la Republica de Panama.  Con el pretexto de arrestar al General Manuel 
Antonio Noriega, el gobierno estadounidense comenzo un ataque respaldado por mas
de 22,000 soldados, helicopteros, canones, tanques y paracaidistas.  En pocas 
horas la infanteria y la marina tomaron control de Ciudad Panama.  Por mar, aire
y tierra atacaron 27 puntos estrategicos a lo largo de la zona del Canal de 
Panama.  La manana del 20 de diciembre instalaron a Guillermo Endara en la 
presidencia de Panama.  El 4 de enero Noriega se rindio.  No es hasta el 13 de 
febrero que Estados Unidos retira sus tropas de Panama, tras derramar toda su 
fuerza devastadora sobre algunas de las comunidades mas pobres del pais.1

La relacion politica de Estados Unidos y Panama ha estado marcada historicamente
por la intervencion de EE.UU.  en los asuntos domesticos de los panamenos.  
Desde 1903, con la independencia de Panama de Colombia, los Estados Unidos 
intensifican su relacion con Panama.  A raiz del control de EE.UU. del Canal de 
Panama han tratado a Panama como una colonia.  La firma del Tratado 
Torrijos-Carter en 1978, el cual disponia que para el ano 2000 el Canal pasaria 
a manos panamenas, fue un duro golpe para los intereses estadounidenses.  Con 
tal de preservar el control del Canal, los Estados Unidos compraban funcionarios
panamenos.  El mejor ejemplo es el propio Noriega quien trabajaba para la CIA a 
pesar de su conocido vinculo con el narcotrafico.  Sin embargo, las 
discrepancias entre Noriega y Washington fueron aumentando.  Para mediados de la
decada de los 80, ya Noriega habia manifestado su intencion de no renegociar el 
Tratado Torrijos-Carter.  Desde 1985 el gobierno estadounidense comenzo a 
planificar la invasion de Panama.   Como medidas anteriores a la invasion el 
gobierno estadounidense apoyo un fallido golpe de estado, impuso un embargo 
economico y provoco confrontaciones con las Fuerzas de Defensas Panamenas (FDP).
Desde principios del ano 1989, Estados Unidos movilizo civiles y tropas, 
cargamentos y armas militares a puntos estrategicos en Panama.  La invasion del 
20 de diciembre fue la culminacion de un muy bien orquestado plan.

En la noche del 20 de diciembre de 1989, como ave de rapina las fuerzas armadas 
del gobierno de los Estados Unidos invadieron la Republica de Panama, atacando 
por mar, tierra y aire el territorio nacional, en violacion de su soberania.  La
-Operacion Justa Causa-, como se le denomino, injustamente se volco su fuerza 
excesiva y devastadora contra los sectores civiles mas indefensos de la sociedad
panamena: areas pobres y marginadas como El Chorrillo que fueron consumidas por 
el despiadado ataque; miles de civiles que fueron asesinados, algunos que 
aparecieron en fosas comunes y otros que se encuentran desaparecidos, muchos que
sufrieron graves danos fisicos y una gran mayoria de la poblacion que sufrio 
intensos danos sicologicos y emocionales que se han extendido hasta nuestros 
dias; hospitales que fueron intervenidos y tomados por las fuerzas militares; 
pequenos negocios que fueron totalmente destruidos; familias completas que 
quedaron desamparadas y sin vivienda, entre otros.  Al dia de hoy, victimas que 
antes no habian podido manifestarse sobre sus danos personales y a sus 
familiares continuan apareciendo y compareciendo a brindar su testimonio ante 
las organizaciones de derechos humanos.  El enorme dano causado es irreparable e
incalculable.

El gobierno de EE.UU. violo los principios fundamentales de no-intervencion de 
la Carta de la Organizacion de Estados Americanos, pues sus articulos prohiben 
accion militar de un Estado Miembro contra otro.  La intervencion tambien 
implica una violacion flagrante de la Declaracion de Derechos y Deberes del 
Hombre, la Carta de las Naciones Unidas, la Convencion de Ginebra de 1949, y el 
Protocolo I de la Convencion de Ginebra

A mediados de 1990, algunas victimas de la invasion, a traves del Centro por 
Derechos Constitucionales (Center for Constitutional Rights), presentaron una 
demanda contra el gobierno de los Estados Unidos exponiendo sus reclamos ante la
Comision Interamericana de Derechos Humanos (C.I.D.H.), O.E.A. y exigiendo 
remedios para los danos sufridos.  El caso de Jose I. Salas Galindo v. Estados 
Unidos2 se encuentra pendiente de resolucion ante aquel foro.

Jose I. Salas perdio a su esposa, su hija quedo herida en su seno derecho y su 
hijo -al igual que su cunado- quedaron heridos con esquirlas por todo el cuerpo,
cuando el 22 de diciembre de 1989, en la ciudad de Colon, un proyectil disparado
indiscriminadamente por helicopteros estadounidenses sobre el edificio en el 
cual vivian impacto su apartamento.  Los sobrevivientes quedaron traumatizados, 
la casa quedo destruida y perdieron todas sus pertenencias. 

Desde 1990 y hasta octubre de 1993 el gobierno de Estados Unidos estuvo 
impugnando la autoridad y jurisdiccion de la C.I.D.H.  Esta decidio el 14 de 
octubre de 1993, en esa primera victoria para los reclamantes, que tenia 
autoridad para considerar el caso en sus meritos y determino que procederia a 
ello, esto es: resolver las medidas que correspondan para remediar las 
violaciones a los derechos humanos propugnados en la Declaracion Americana de 
los Derechos y Deberes del Hombre de y los danos sufridos como consecuencia de 
las acciones de combate de las fuerzas armadas de los Estados Unidos de America 
que constituyeron la invasion.  Se rechazo ademas que las transferencias de 
dinero del gobierno invasor al gobierno panameno constituyera una indemnizacion 
adecuada a las victimas de la invasion.

Jose I. Salas fallecio poco despues de la decision de octubre de 1993, confiado 
en que la O.E.A. le haria justicia a su familia y a su patria.  Miles de 
victimas panamenas de la invasion continuan la accion instada por Salas.  La 
lucha no ha sido facil, ademas de las condiciones infrahumanas en la que viven 
la mayoria de los sobrevivientes, muchos permanecen desaparecidos o enterrados 
en fosas comunes.  

En vistas celebradas el 3 de febrero y el 6 de setiembre de 1995 presentaron su 
prueba, testifical, documental y pericial ante la C.I.D.H.  El 3 de noviembre de
1995, los demandantes presentaron su alegato ante la C.I.D.H.  Las crasas 
violaciones a los derechos humanos de los reclamantes por parte del invasor 
fueron totalmente sustentadas.  Por su parte, el gobierno de los Estados Unidos 
no ha presentado ante la C.I.D.H. prueba alguna a su favor que contravenga 
aquella presentada por los demandantes. A pesar de haber solicitado prorrogas 
que le fueron concedidas para preparar su alegato, tampoco lo ha presentado.  
Los terminos que le fueron concedidos vencieron el pasado mes de abril de 1996. 
Desde esa fecha el caso se encuentra sometido para resolucion.  Las victimas 
panamenas exigen justicia ahora y una pronta decision favorable de la C.I.D.H.

La actitud de los Estados Unidos ha sido una de continua arrogancia, mostrando 
una total indiferencia hacia la C.I.D.H. y la O.E.A.  Se han negado 
continuamente a reconocer la jurisdiccion de la C.I.D.H para entender sobre las 
violaciones a los derechos humanos que han cometido los EE.UU.  Mas aun, durante
la pasada asamblea de la O.E.A., a raiz del cuestionamiento que hicieran varios 
paises miembros sobre la recien aprobada Ley Helms-Burton y sus efectos 
extraterritoriales.  Los representantes del gobierno de EE.UU. arremetieron 
contra los delegados ante la O.E.A. por atreverse a cuestionar una ley 
estadounidense y les exigieron silencio.  Anadieron que eran unos cobardes que 
no reconocian en la ley Helms-Burton una medida en defensa de los derechos 
humanos.

Resultan ironicas y ridiculas las expresiones de los representantes del gobierno
estadounidense proclamandose respetuoso de los derechos humanos y pretendiendo 
imponer una mordaza a los paises latinoamericanos que protestan ante la Ley 
Helms-Burton por sus efectos devastadores al pueblo cubano y por sus 
consecuencias extraterritoriales.  El pueblo panameno, y el latinoamericano en 
general, conoce y recuerda el largo historial de violaciones de los derechos 
humanos de los latinoamericanos que tiene los EE.UU. QPuerto Rico, Cuba, 
Guatemala, Republica Dominicana, Chile, Haiti, Granada, por solo nombrar 
algunos.  Ademas, conoce y recuerda las flagrantes violaciones a los derechos 
humanos cometidas en territorio nacional panameno durante la invasion militar de
1989.

La pasada semana se celebro la XXVI Asamblea General de la Organizacion de 
Estados Americanos en Centro de Convenciones ATLAPA, Panama.  Por su parte, las 
victimas panamenas de la invasion estadounidense de diciembre de 1989 comenzaron
una manifestacion en las afueras exigiendo justicia para sus reclamos de 
indemnizacion por sus danos fisicos, sicologos y perdidas economicas.  La 
manifestacion se extendio por toda la semana. Se programaron varias actividades 
que incluyeron piquetes, vigilias, exposicion de fotografias, y testimonios de 
victimas sobre sus experiencias durante la invasion y las huellas permanentes 
que ha dejado sobre sus vidas.
	
Durante su manifestacion frente al Centro de Convenciones ATLAPA, las victimas 
de la invasion solicitaron audiencia del Secretario General de la O.E.A. para 
que tomara conocimiento de los procedimientos de su caso ante la C.I.D.H., para 
expresar su interes en que prontamente se produzca una resolucion en su caso e 
impedir que el gobierno de los Estados Unidos continue retrasando los 
procedimientos.  Una comision de los querellantes y su abogada la licenciada 
Gilma Camargo fueron recibidos por representantes de la C.I.D.H.  Se espera una 
decision de la C.I.D.H. para el mes de setiembre de 1996.

Nos sentimos plenamente identificados con la lucha del pueblo panameno que es la
lucha de todos los pueblos latinoamericanos por el respeto a sus derechos 
humanos y a sus soberanias nacionales.  Este caso ante la C.I.D.H. representa un
precedente importantisimo en la lucha por los derechos humanos en America 
Latina.  Por primera ocasion, un foro internacional accede a que Qsin la 
asistencia de su propio gobiernoQ los ciudadanos de un pais victimas de agresion
por parte de EE.UU. demanden justicia e indemnizacion por perjuicios causados.  
La C.I.D.H. ha solidificado su jurisdiccion, dando acceso a los ciudadanos, a 
pesar de la posicion del gobierno de turno en el pais afectado.  La apertura de 
este foro resulta trascendental para los paises Latinoamericanos.  Asi, se 
fortalece a la C.I.D.H. como organismo adjudicador de controversias de derechos 
humanos, proveyendo un foro verdaderamente util para que los perjudicados por 
infracciones a sus derechos humanos puedan dilucidar sus reclamos contra el 
gobierno o estado opresor.  Por otro lado, se envia un mensaje claro y 
contundente a EE.UU. y a otros gobiernos poderosos de que instituciones 
internacionales podran enjuiciar sus flagrantes violaciones a los derechos 
humanos para que no queden impunes.  Se trata ademas de una oportunidad mas para
que la O.E.A. reivindique su triste papel historico de refrendar las actuaciones
viles de los Estados Unidos en Latinoamerica.

+++  Una orden de arresto contra directivos de un banco intervenido
desde el 24 de marzo pasado ordeno este lunes la Procuraduria
General de la Nacion a la vez que sus abogados mostraron sorpresa
por el cambio de configuracion juridica del caso.
     La orden contra Manuel Salvador Morales, Bruno Bemporad y
Maritza de Mattaden presidente, Gerente y subgerente,
respectivamente del Banco Agro Industrial y Comercial de Panama
(BANAICO) varia las investigaciones ya que los directivos eran
investigados por presunta comision de estafa.
     Segun la Procuraduria General la actual orden de arresto
contra los tres directivos es por asociacion ilicita para
delinquir.
     Una investigacion en abril pasado ordenada por la Comision
Bancaria de Panama, quien mantiene decision de negar un recurso de
liquidacion solicitado por el presidente del banco, revelo que
dicha entidad bancaria realizo prestamos de "dudosa recuperacion"
por mas de 50 millones de dolares.


+++  Un estudio de prueba para medir la capacidad de reaccion del
continente americano frente a desastres naturales realizara el
Comando Sur de Estados Unidos acantonado en Panama, informaron
fuentes de la Direccion Nacional de Proteccion Civil (SINAPROCC).
     Roberto Velasquez, director de SINAPROCC, explico que el
estudio sera un ejercicio en seco de tres dias via satelite por
medio de computadoras y radio.
     Segun el funcionario el Comando Sur realiza estos ejercicios
de asistencia a la poblacion, luego de ser ensayados en Venezuela
y Honduras.


+++  Dirigentes de la etnia Kuna mostraron indignacion ante la
falta de atencion social de su Congreso General al tiempo que
exigieron la union del pueblo y el pensar menos en intereses
personales.
     Efrain Tejada, dirigente de la comunidad de San Ignacio de
Tupile, critico a los asesores de los sailas dummagan por
considerar que no cumplen bien su funcion.
     "Parece que las autoridades de la Comarca no les interesa la
salud de los Kunas; el congreso no presta atencion como en anos
anteriores", manifesto Tejada.
     En tanto, Tito Kantule, administrador del Congreso General,
rechazo las afirmaciones y defendio a los asesores declarando que
"ellos unicamente dan una orientacion y posibles soluciones de los
problemas".
     Kantule advirtio que el Congreso "no maneja mucho dinero" y
explico que las comisiones de salud y educacion no han solicitado
una reunion para solicitar apoyo.

+++  Un alto consejero del mandatario Ernesto Perez Balladares fue
blanco de acusaciones de presunta implicacion en lavado de dinero,
segun publico este martes un diario norteamericano.
     La informacion del diario "Miami Herald" y firmada por el
periodista Glenn Garvin, revelo que el empresario y actual asesor
presidencial, Alfredo Aleman, renuncio en 1995 a un cargo directivo
en el Banco Nacional de Panama "bajo fuerte presion del
Departamento de Estado de los Estados Unidos" que lo involucraba en
lavado de dinero.
     Segun el rotativo, Aleman represento "una figura clave en la
sorpredente victoria electoral de Perez Balladares de 1994".
     Sostiene el diario que en febrero de 1995 el Canciller,
Gabriel Lewis, informo al jefe de gobierno panameno que el
Departamento de Estado rehusaria ayudar a Panama si Aleman no era
removido de su cargo oficial.
     El empresario Aleman tambien tenia vinculos comerciales con el
el Banco Agro Industrial de Panama -actualmente intervenido-, del
cual renuncio como presidente y secretario en 1994, senala el
diario nortemericano.
     La informacion del Miami Herald se adiciona a una publicacion
de la revista britana "The Economist" donde presuntamente se deja
entrever la financiacion electoral de figuras del gobierno mediante
el lavado de dinero.


+++  Los pueblos indigenas de la etnia Kuna consideraron como
amenaza directa la advertencia del gobernante panameno, Ernesto
Perez Balladares, donde afirma que "deberan aceptar los proyectos
turisticos que se planean en el area".
     El Administrador del Congreso General Kuna, Tito Perez, afirmo
que la advertencia del mandatario sorprendio a la Comarca Kuna Yala
y al parecer "el desconoce las leyes que la rigen".
     Agrego que los Kunas no desconocen las intenciones de
concesion turistica y minera que esta ofreciendo el Ejecutivo y
ello "representa un gobierno de imposicion que no aceptamos".


     Perez dijo que ante la advertencia del jefe de gobierno el
Congreso General analizara la situacion para dar un pronunciamiento
oficial al respecto.


12 de junio

+++  Directivos del gobernante Partido Revolucionario Democratico
(PRD) reconocieron este martes su derrota ante el proyecto ley de
amnistia que iniciaba su discusion dentro del Pleno parlamentario
y aseguraron que el tema "ya es historia".
     Mitchell Doens, Secretario General del PRD, afirmo que el tema
de la amnistia estaba creando "condiciones de confrontaciones" y se
alejaba de su intencion inicial y "en mi opinion esta enterrado".
     En tanto, el subsecretario del partido, Francisco Sanchez,
dijo que la amnistia es parte de la historia y con el rechazo
ciudadano no  "creo que ningun legislador se arriesge a plantearlo
nuevamente a la Asamblea Legislativa".
     Cardenas coincidio con la propuesta de la Iglesia Catolica
panamena que recomienda un indulto para los detenidos que ya
cumplieron sus condenas sin haber sido procesados.
     El proyecto ley de amnistia se presento a debate parlamentario
el pasado 26 de mayo, pero recibio rechazo de sectores sociales.


+++  La exigencia de empleos en la provincia de Colon fue
nuevamente el motivo de protesta de ciudadanos de este sector del
pais, luego que el Gobierno Nacional no presentara alternativa al
clamor de los manifestantes.
     La manifestacion liderizada por el grupo "Reaccion 3" provoco
el cierre de avenidas en la provincia y la quema de basura y
llantas.
     Medios locales de prensa aseguraron que durante la protesta
los sublevados se agruparon en la Iglesia Catolica de San Jose, en
la Avenida Central, para lanzar consignas contra el gobierno. En la
protesta no intervino la Policia Nacional.



+++  Al menos 250 personas resultaron damnificadas al incendiarse
en la madrugada de este martes tres casas de madera en un
corregimiento de la ciudad capital, segun informaron autoridades
municipales.
     Informes no oficiales revelaron que el incendio se produjo
cuando tres personas intentaron romper y robar los alambres de
cobre de electricidad de las viviendas.
     El incendio no dejo heridos graves, ni victimas que lamentar,
pero si 70 familias de escasos recursos que perdieron todos sus
enseres materiales.
     Los damnificados fueron reubicados en un sector proximo al
lugar del incendio donde seran atendidos hasta una segunda nueva
decision.



13 de junio

+++  El mandatario, Ernesto Perez Balladares, salio este miercoles
en defensa de la imagen de su gobierno y de sus asesores politicos
ante las acusaciones de medios internacionales que le comprometen
en el lavado de dinero.
     Dias atras los diarios norteamericanos "Miami Herald", "New
York Times" y la revista britanica "The Economist" publicaron una
serie de acusaciones segun la cual la campana politica de Perez
Balladares en 1994 estuvo financiada por dineros del narcotrafico.
     Perez Balladares reacciono duramente y aseguro que la
intencion de estas publicaciones es danar la imagen internacional
de Panama y dejar dudas ante la opinion publica.
     El gobernante reto a los medios internacionales para que
presenten pruebas de sus informaciones y despejar de una vez la
desinformacion creada.
     "No tengo absolutamente nada que tapar, proteger o de lo cual
sentirme avergonzado, al contrario, reto nuevamente a quien tenga
informacion que vincule a cualquier miembro de mi Gobierno o
campana con el narcotrafico o lavado de dinero que la pongan en las
cortes", enfantizo.
     Referente a un alto consejero de su gobierno acusado de
presunta implicacion en lavado de dinero en una publicacion del
"Miami Herald", Perez Balladares indico que "el empresario Alfredo
Aleman ayudo en mi campana, pero no fue factor decisivo en mi
triunfo electoral, sino un contribuyente mas".
     La informacion del "Miami Herald" respecto a que Aleman
renuncio de su puesto de directivo en el Banco Nacional de Panama
ante presiones del Departamento de Estado dijo que "es falso" y la
causa fue por "un supuesto encausamiento contra el" en Estados
Unidos y no queria afectar al gobierno.
     El jefe del Ejecutivo aclaro que toda "esta campana
desinformativa" no tiene nada que ver con el gobierno de Estados
Unidos. Perez Balladares vinculo en esta campana a una
exfuncionaria que ante diferencias personales tuvo que ser
despedida de su cargo.


14 de junio


+++  Cerca de 48 familias presentaron este jueves formal protesta
ante la Comision de Credenciales de la Asamblea Legislativa frente
al escape de aguas negras y filtraciones de aguas en las paredes
del inmueble donde residen.
     Los denunciantes senalaron que los apartamento construidos por
el Ministerio de la Vivienda en 1991 son una "estafa" porque al
ocupar el inmueble se les informo que eran recien construidos, pero
que en verdad eran reconstruidos.
     Los residentes del edificio, ubicado en el corregimiento de
Santa Ana, en la ciudad capital, exigieron respuestas inmediatas y
advirtieron que de lo contrario suspenderan el pago mensual.


+++  Datos estadisticos de la Policia Nacional indicaron este
jueves que el indice de violencia a nivel nacional en los que va
del presente ano disminuyo en un 65%, en comparacion con igual
periodo del ano 1995.
     El informe revelo que en los casos delictivos la disminucion
en igual perido fue de 459 casos menos.
     Frente a los casos de hurtos las datos fueron de 234 casos
menos; mientras que en las lesiones con armas aumento de 95 a 105
nuevos casos.
     Sin embargo, ante la dismunicion de casos de violencia en el
pais la Policia Tecnica Judicial (PTJ) otorgo cerca de 70 mil
nuevos permisos a la ciudadania para portar armas de fuego de
distintos calibres.
     
     
+++  Un estudio de posible aumento de peajes a las naves que
transitan por el Canal de Panama realiza la Administracion de la
via interoceanica.
     Asi lo indico Gilberto Guardia, Administrador del Canal, quien
indico que el posible aumento de peaje es para cubrir el programa
de modernizacion comtemplado hasta el ano 2,005.
     Guardia afirmo que en los proximos dos meses la Administracion
y la Junta Directiva de la Comision del Canal deberan tomar una
decision al respecto.
     El aumento de los peajes dependera del balance que arrojen los
presupuestos de inversion para los anos 1997-1998, contra la
ganancia que se prevee obtendra el Canal en ese periodos, sostuvo
el Administrador.
     El funcionario dijo que el ultimo aumento de peaje fue en el
ano 1992 y siempre han mantenido "una politica juiciosa".

ACTION ALERT

SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND MEDIA BLAME WORKERS FOR VIOLENCE WHILE
DEATH SQUADS ROAM FREE:
U.S. MUST PRESSURE TO BRING REAL CRIMINALS TO JUSTICE

June 19, 1996

On June 6, el Diario de Hoy, the right-wing daily paper, published
a story blaming public sector unions for plotting violent actions
to prevent privatization of ANTEL, the telecommunications company.
While labor has denied the charges, government officials including
the Vice Minister for Public Security have leveled veiled threats
of consequences against public workers.  Unionists fear that a
climate is being generated for death squad violence against
workers and particularly ASTTEL (the union of ANTEL workers) in
this time when they are rallying public opposition to a
privatization plan which will cut phone services, raise prices,
increase unemployment and further enrich a handful of wealthy
Salvadorans and international capital.

This scapegoating and vilifying of organized labor comes at a time
when ARENA is trying to divert attention from internal strife
which is widely considered linked to recent bombings.  On May 25,
a bomb blew up at SISA, an insurance company in which ex-President
Cristiani is the majority stockholder, only a month after a car
bomb exploded near Cristiani's home.

While Government officials and the right wing press blame workers
for escalating violence, the FMLN has used the attacks as an
example of the need go after the real criminals once and for all
by following up on the work of the Truth Commission and the Joint
Group to investigate and prosecute the death squads.

In late May, Salvador Snchez Cern, Coordinator of the FMLN,
released to a television station the names of death squad leaders
in Berlin, Usulutn who had recently met in that city.  The group
includes ex-military officers, purged from the army in the peace
process, as well as wealthy business people, landholders and the
current Head of Operations for the Land Bank.

While the Government and media hope to blame labor for violence
international solidarity must weigh in to defend the workers and
pressure the government to investigate the real criminals.

Suggested Action:

1. Get your Congressional Representative to fax the following
letter to John Hamilton, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
Latin America and the Caribbean and to send copies CC: to Anne
Patterson, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American
Affairs and Ambassador James Dobbins, Special Assistant to the
President for Latin America at the National Security Council.

Sample letter******

John Hamilton Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Latin
America and the Caribean Inter-American Affairs, State Department

    I am writing to express my grave concern with recent public
    declarations in El Salvador by the press and high-ranking
    officials against labor activists and the continued inaction
    on key components of the Peace Accords around public security
    and the death squads.


   A June 6th story in el Diario de Hoy and subsequent allegations
   by high-ranking officials in the Salvadoran Government,
   (including the Vice Minister of Public Security), charged
   public employees, as well as the FMLN, with plotting violence
   against the state to halt privatization of the
   telecommunications company ANTEL.  The PNC's Sub-Director for
   Operations, Rolando Garcia has stated publicly that the charges
   have not been confirmed.  But I question the motives of
   government officials who would so irresponsibly echo
   unconfirmed charges of this sort.

   In El Salvador's recent past, such accusations have given the
   green light to death squads and those death squads continue to
   act with impunity.  It has come to my attention that only a few
   weeks ago, in late May, the coordinator of the FMLN released a
   list of ex-military officers, landowners and the current head
   of Operations for the Land Bank who had allegedly met in the
   eastern part of El Salvador to discuss continued death squad
   activity.

   These events combined with the recent attacks against
   ex-President Cristiani make it more urgent than ever that
   legislative reforms to the police and the Penal Code, which
   remain stalled in the Legislative Assembly, and the pending
   reforms to Public Security reccomended by the UN Mission in El
   Salvador last fall, be implemented as soon as possible.

   Furthermore these events once again underline the need for a
   thorough investigation into violent acts in El Salvador and
   there would be nowhere more appropriate to set such a precedent
   than by following up on the Truth Commission and the Joint
   Group's recommendations to dismantle the death squad apparatus
   in that country.  The end of next month will mark two years
   since the Joint Group issued its report.

   This report contained an annex which was said to name names and
   detail evidence of death squad participants.  Yet to this date
   no progress can be measured regarding follow up to that
   information.

   I would like to know exactly what is the State Department doing
   to:
a) Express concern for unsubstantiated charges of violence being
made against unions;
b) Help overcome the deadlock in the legislature regarding the
police and penal reforms;
c) Pressure for implementation of the still pending
recommendations of the UN on Public         Security matters; and
d) Encourage a full investigation of the recent bombings and death
squad activity based on      the information contained in the
annex to the report of the Joint Group.

   I await your response regarding these matters.

Sincerely,

cc: Ann Patterson, Acting Assistant Secretary for Inter American
Affairs
      Ambassador James Dobbins, NSC

+++  Parlamentarios de la Comision de Comercio de la Asamblea
Legislativa estudiaran un anteproyecto de ley para regular el
secreto bancario en Panama y crear procedimientos necesarios para
consagrar formalmente la obligacion del banco, sus administradores,
empleados o personas que tengan acceso a informacion sobre sus
operaciones.
     Las normas en materia de secreto bancario estan "un poco
dispersas" porque se fundamentan en el secreto profesional e impide
a la Comision Bancaria revisar las cuentas de prestamos y depositos
y estos no ha sido corregidos, senalo Arturo Vallarino, miembro de
la Comision Parlamentaria.
     La propuesta que se estudia -indico Vallarino- otorgara
potestad a la Comision Bancaria para que revise los libros de
cualquier entidad bancaria ante denuncias que se presenten.
     Agrego que con esta legislacion se intenta corregir la "laguna
legal" en materia bancaria en Panama y corregir fallas que han
llevado a la quiebra a bancos extranjeros y nacionales.


+++  Un juicio contra cuatro galenos acusados de homicidio culposo
fue suspendido por quinta vez este lunes ante la decision de un
Juez de Distrito en la provincia de Chiriqui.
     La audiencia contra Evelia de Esquivel, Mario Giron, Ivo
Guevara y Zoralia Barraza fue suspendio por falta de resueltos del
Tribunal ante dos incidentes presentados por la defensa de uno de
los encausados.
     Los galenos estan acusados de negligencia medica a un paciente
que murio el 24 de junio de 1991 por temor a infectarse con el
Sindrome de Inmunodeficiencia Adquirida (SIDA). Segun el expediente
medico el paciente padecia de diabetes.
     El juicio inicial estaba fijado para iniciar el 9 de octubre
de 1995, pero ha sido suspendido en cinco ocasiones.




+++  Una firma de abogados denuncio violaciones al Codigo Fiscal
panameno que comprometen a la Autoridad de la Region Interoceanica
(ARI) por las ventas de residencias en Fuerte Espinar en la
provincia de Colon.
     El abogado Rolando Villalaz, de la firma Villalaz y Asociados,
indico que la ARI esta violando su propia ley y los avaluos de las
tierras porque no se han realizado como lo establece el Codigo
Fiscal lo que representa una violacion.
     La ARI es una institucion creada en 1994 con la finalidad de
administrar las propiedades revertidas a Panama de las bases
militares norteamericanas acantonadas en suelo panameno y
contempladas en los Tratados Torrijos-Carter.
          
     
18 de junio

+++  El informe anual de la organizacion humanitaria Amnistia
Internacional (AI) publicado este martes en diarios locales revelo
que en agosto de 1995 los sindicalistas opuestos a las reformas del
Codigo Laboral recibieron "malos tratos" del gobierno del
presidente Ernesto Perez Balladares.
     La organizacion recalco que a ra!z de las protestas y huelgas
en rechazo a las reformas laborales en 1995, se registro la muerte
de cuatro trabajadores, un numero n21 de junio de 1996o precisado
de heridos y mas de 300 detenidos.
     AI tambien hizo enfasis en el castigo de Jueces de la
provincia de Chiriqui contra indigenas de la etnia ngobe-bugle por
reclamos de propiedad de tierras.
     Dentro del informe se critico el indulto presidencial de
setiembre pasado en favor de personas vinculadas al gobierno del
General (R) Manuel Noriega.


+++  Denuncias de irrespeto a la libertad sindical de parte del
gobierno panameno formulo un dirigente sindical panameno durante su
participacion en la 83 Conferencia de la Organizacion Internacional
del Trabajo (OIT), en Suiza.
     La acusacion de Mariano Mena, Secretario de la Central General
de Trabajadores de Panama (CGTP), y reproducida en el diario "La
Prensa", aseguro que la admistracion de Ernesto Perez Balladares
"no ampara los convenios 87 y 98 de la OIT" referente a la
negociacion colectiva y la libertad sindical.
     Mena admitio que en Panama se han logrado corregir algunas
violaciones sistematicas y reiteradas a los convenios de la OIT a
raiz de las reformas al Codigo Laboral en 1995.


19 de junio

+++  El Congreso General de la etnia Kuna rechazo oficialmente la
advertencia del Ejecutivo de aceptar los proyectos turisticos en el
area y ordeno el desalojo de un hotel contruido en la comunidad de 
Ukubseni.
     Los indigenas consideraron "ilegal" la introduccion de
inversiones "wagas" (no kunas) en la Comarca porque sentaria un
precedente negativo en cuanto a perdida de su identidad.
     El hotel Iskardup se construyo en Ukubseni sin la autorizacion
del Congreso General Kuna (CGK), pero la comunidad alega que fue el
dueno de la isla, Rutilio Herrera, quien autorizo dicha
contruccion.
     Desde el pasado 28 de enero la comunidad de Ukubseni prohibio
a la empresa Judgle Adventures el envio de turistas al area.
     Por su parte, los administradores del hotel aseguraron que la
empresa no tomara ninguna accion hasta que el CGK no le comunique
oficialmente y por escrito la decision final.


+++  Un aumento de 5.9% del ingreso por peaje en su primer semestre
del ano fiscal 1996 reflejo el transito de naves por el Canal de
Panama, segun informo este martes la Comision del Canal de Panama.
     El aumento reflejo un ingreso de 329.3 millones de dolares,
generado de los 9 mil 367 barcos que han transitado el Canal entre
septiembre de 1995 y mayo de 1996.
     Segun el portavoz de la Comision, Franklin Castrellon, el
promedio diario de trafico por el Canal asciende a 38.4 buques lo
que anticipa un ano recor en ingresos por peajes.
     De continuar esta tendencia de ingresos y transitos -afirmo el
funcionario- el Canal mejorara sus resultados de explotacion y
establecera records por segundo ano consecutivo, acercandose a los
500 millones de dolares por peajes.
     Las previsiones de la Comision del Canal senalan que en el
proximo decenio el incremento de los transitos sera de un 2% anual.


+++  Las acusaciones de "malos tratos" contra dirigentes sindicales
en agosto 1995 denunciadas en el informe anual de Amnistia
Internacional (AI) fueron rechazadas por miembros del gobernante
Partido Revolucionario Democratico (PRD).
     La acusacion de AI "es muy generica" por su terminologia
debido a que la afirmacion "malos tratos" puede significar entre
otras cosas mala alimentacion y hacinamiento en las carceles
panamenas, afirmo Mitchel Doens.
     Doens, Subsecretario General del PRD, sostuvo que en Panama se
puede afirmar que "no hay torturas, ni presos politicos, porque
nuestro gobierno no persigue a ningun dirigente".
     El tambien Ministro de Trabajo dijo que el gobierno del
presidente Perez Balladares esta empenado en profundizar la
democracia y respetar los derechos humanos.


20 de junio

+++  Una delegacion de tres personas enviadas por la Union Europea
(UE) a Panama llego este miercoles para iniciar la revision de
estudios sobre alternativas al Canal de Panama.
     La delegacion la encabezan los expertos Guy Collileux, Didier
Roult y Michel Cote quienes daran seguimiento a la visita del
mandatario Ernesto Perez Ballladares en una gira realizada por seis
estados europeos en mayo pasado.
      El Embajador de la Comision Europea para Centraoamerica y
Panama, Dieter Koing, al presentar a la delegacion afirmo que la
iniciativa de la UE radica en revisar y actualizar los estudios de
alternativas del Canal de Panama.
     Agrego que tambien se busca identificar las modalidades y
actividades necesarias para apoyar la organizacion del Congreso
Universal del Canal, previsto para setiembre del proximo ano.
     Actualmente las 15 naciones que conforman la UE son los
segundos usuarios de la via interoceanica.


+++  Familiares de un recluso fallecido en una reyerta entre bandas
rivales en una penitenciaria de la provincia de Colon denunciaron
este miercoles ante la Comision de Derechos Humanos de la Asamblea
Legislativa "irregularidades" cometidas por los custodios del
penal.
     Jaime Ponce, hermano de la victima, declaro que este le pidio
al Capital de la penitenciaria Nueva Esperanza que "lo sacara del
pabellon donde se encontraba" porque habia recibido amenazas de
muerte, pero no se le escucho.
     Ponce aseguro que la carcel "no esta sirviendo para
resocializar a los presos, sino mas bien para embrutecerlos, porque
los companeros que presenciaron los actos, cuando tengan la
oportunidad de hacerlo, lo haran".
     La reyerta en Monte Esperanza dejo al menos 4 muertos y 15
personas heridas.

+++  El canciller panameno, Ricardo Arias, nego que exista una
campana de Washington para "ablandar" a Panama en el tema de las
bases militares mas alla del ano 2,000 a la vez que advirtio que el
gobierno nacional "no se dejara ablandar".
     Arias explico ante parlamentarios de la Comision de Asuntos
Exteriores que para ablandar hacen falta dos cosas: "el que trata
de ablandar y el que se deja ablandar y esten seguros que el
gobierno no se ablandara".
     El funcionario fue citado por la Comision de Asuntos
Exteriores para responder a un cuestionario de cuatro preguntas
sobre el tema de las negociaciones de las bases.
     Las conversaciones exploratorias fueron suspendidas en
noviembre de 1995 y no se han reiniciado, debido a que ambos paises
adelantan un proceso de consulta interna.
     El General John Sheedan, jefe del Comando Sur del Atlantico de
los Estados Unidos comprometio semanas atras al Ejecutivo panameno
cuando aseguro que cerca de 4,000 soldados norteamericanos
permanecerian en Panama mas alla del ano 2,000.


+++  Las negociaciones de bienes y servicios entre Panama y paises
miembros de la Union Europea (UE) para el ingreso de la nacion
centroamericana a la Organizacion Mundial del Comercio concluyeron
este jueves luego de depositar los documentos firmados en la
Secretaria del Organismo.
     Segun informacion publicada en el diario "El Panama America"
los miembros de la UE mostraron complacencia con la delegacion
panamena por la forma "seria y transparente" de la negociacion.
     El acuerdo llegado en Ginebra, Suiza permitira el trabajo de
confeccion del protocolo de adhesion de Panama a la OMC en
setiembre proximo.

*** PEACE BRIGADES INTERNATIONAL ***
CENTRAL AMERICA PROJECT (GUATEMALA) 6/96 REPORT

As was foreseen, the Accord on Socioeconomic Aspects
and the Agrarian Situation was signed on May 6 in
Mexico City, leaving both negotiating parties, as well
as the international community, satisfied.=20

The 39 page document establishes a set of minimal and
basic reforms designed to instill long term changes in
the direction of State Modernisation.  The Accord
revolves around five main points: Democracy and
Participatory Development, Social Development, the
Agrarian Situation and Rural Development,
Modernisation of Public Policy and Fiscal Management,
and Final Arrangements.=20

The Agrarian Situation has provided a focal point in
the negotiation, being one of the main causes of the
escalation of armed conflict and one of the central
themes in Guatemalan politics today.  Amongst the
commitments agreed to by the government, of special
interest is the creation of a land bank which will
begin operation in 1997, as well as the promotion and
publication of a law which monitors the functioning of
it.=20

In 1999, the government will evaluate the functioning


of the project and compare it with its objectives.=20
Another promise was the development of a national land
registration project, in which the government promises
to initiate a survey of land distribution information,
starting in January of 1997.  In the finance
department, one of the more positive points was the
provision of legal reinforcement mechanisms to avoid
tax evasion, which, it is assumed will normalize the
fiscal debt (Inforpress, 9.5.96).  =20

As the penultimate accord of the substantive agenda
was signed, the National Revolutionary Union of
Guatemala (URNG) announced the immediate suspension of
the forced collection of the "war tax" from landowners
and business owners.  An investigation initiated by
the Ombuds Office for Human Rights (PDH) revealed the
existence of evidence proving that the "war tax"
collected by the URNG continues to be demanded in
various plantations in Santa Rosa and Jutiapa.=20

It is still to be determined if they are truly being
carried out by members of the insurgency.  The
president of the governmental Peace Commission
(COPAZ), Gustavo Porras, after contemplating the
situation, declared that those carrying out the
collection of this tax are not in fact members of the
URNG (La Republica, 21.5.96).  =20
Different Sectors, Distinct Reactions  =20

The Assembly of Civil Society, one of the sectors most
directly involved in the negotiation process,
requested the integration of a High Level Commission
to study what was signed.  An even more critical
viewpoint was offered by the National Coordination of
Campesino Organisations (CNOC), which brings together
various organisations which are struggling to obtain
land titles, including CONIC and CUC. =20

While valuing the accord because it provides
possibilities "to resolve in an integral way the
problematic of campesinos", CNOC established that "the
accord is incomplete and insufficient with regards to
concrete mechanisms to resolve land conflicts".  =20

In contrast to the critics, the satisfaction of the
business sector was evident as they were one of the
first to applaud the accord.  The Coordinating
Commission of Agricultural, Commercial, Industrial and
Finance Associations (CACIF) expressed their complete
backing of the accord and made an international call
to all businesses to continue investing in Guatemala.=20
Humberto Pretti, president of CACIF, highlighted the
planning of a national land registration project and
the development of a land bank, claiming that it will
legitimize property owners (Inforpress, 16.5.96).=20

Various political analysts agree that the accord,
deemed a strategic step in the negotiating process,
builds on elements which are already integral parts of
the constitution and the legal framework of the
country, and what it hopes to achieve is "to be not
only an announcement of good intentions but move on to
become the legal base of the capital development of
Guatemala" (El Grafico, 8.6.96).=20

In reality, as many sectors have pointed out, the
accord is based on good intentions, and opens more
political space for the URNG to insert itself into the
political and legal framework of the country.=20
Guerrilla Comandante Gaspar Ilom confirms this when he
says that he is working on "a transition from armed
struggle", adding that the URNG is looking to conform
into a national political project which will transcend
the peace negotiations (Inforpress, 16.5.96).  =20

On May 12th, the Guatemalan daily, Siglo Veintiuno,
reported that Luis Becker, Francisco Villagran, Luz
Mendez and possibly Pedro Palma Lau all retired from
the political-diplomatic team of the URNG, virtually
dissolving the advisor team to the URNG.  The general
command of the URNG have not confirmed nor denied this
information.  The reason for the retirement, according
to the paper, was their discontentment with the way
that the Socioeconomic and Agrarian Reforms were
negotiated.=20

The team leaves the URNG with only one more
substantive theme in the negotiations; Strengthening
Civil Power and the Role of the Army in a Democratic
Society.  =20

Special Delivery from the US: Conflictive Documents =20


During the month of May, Guatemala received more than
6,305 documents which were declassified by the U.S.
State Department regarding human rights violations
against United States citizens during the period
between 1984 and 1995.  The documentation contains
important information regarding, among others cases,
the assassination of United States citizen Michael
Devine by a military patrol in Guatemala's northern
department of El Peten; the kidnapping and subsequent
torture in 1989 of Ursulin nun Diana Ortiz, and the
capture and subsequent assassination of guerrilla
commander Efrain Bamaca.  =20

Of the information contained in the U.S. State
Department files, 8 per cent was not revealed to the
Guatemalan government, including information regarding
CIA involvement in Guatemala, claiming "security
reasons".  For more than forty years, the CIA has been
accused of having strong ties with repressive agents
of the Guatemalan state, which calls into question the
effectiveness of the documentation which has been
sent.=20

According to The New York Times, "documents which were
declassified could help in determining those
responsible for assassinations in Guatemala,
specifically that of guerrilla leader Efrain Bamaca,
known as Comandante Everaldo and that of North
American citizen Michael Devine."  According to the
well-respected daily newspaper, a member of the
Clinton Administration who was not in agreement with
the manner in which the case was handled by the US
government reported that "the Guatemalan Colonel and
CIA agent Roberto Alpirez is responsible for the
Bamaca and Devine assassinations" (Inforpress,
16.5.96).  =20

Upon their arrival to Guatemala, the documents were
brought to the Supreme Court of Justice, which,
corresponding to the penal legislation in effect, had
it sent to the Public Prosecutor's Office, which is in
charge of managing investigations of this sort.=20
The Office refused to open the documents, claiming
they were sent against legal norms (Prensa Libre,
16.5.96).  According to Ronalth Ochaeta, director of
the Archbishop's Human Rights Office (ODHA), the
Public Prosecutor's Office has demonstrated a lack of
goodwill and efficiency in investigating important
cases which extend to different State organisms and
could "burn their hands" with information which could
be very implicating (Prensa Libre, 21.5.96).  =20

Solidarity Tax and Anti-Strike Law  =20

With a majority of National Advance Party (PAN)
deputies and the opposition of the remaining political
parties, Congress approved the establishment of the
Extraordinary and Temporary Solidarity Tax which,
according to government forces, will permit the
strengthening of State structures, diminish the
internal debt and support the political economy in
1996 and 1997.=20

This tax affects all citizens who receive a net annual
income greater than 48,000 quetzales and, according to
the Centre for National Economic Investigations, the
determination of the tax paid on last year's declared
net income penalizes those who have declared their
incomes and paid their taxes, while it will be more
difficult to oblige those who still have not declared
to contribute the extraordinary tax (Siglo Veintiuno,
16.5.96).  =20

At the end of the month, Congress undertook a second
reading of the conflictive reforms to the State
Worker's Strike Regulation and Labour Law.  Part of
the objective of the reforms are to prohibit the right
to strike for a number of health, public sector and
social service workers.  It also aims to restrict
strikes in sectors providing such vital services as
water, transportation, electricity and other
combustibles, and other cases which gravely affect the
national economy and put the health of the population
at risk.=20

The reforms are based in the fact that State Workers
have not respected the Constitution when they have
paralysed essential services such as hospitals and
recently, the justice system.     Since the potential
reform was presented in Congress by a PAN
representative, it has provoked strong opposition on
the part of the majority of labour organisations, as
well as the parliamentary minorities.  During the
beginning of the discussion on this point, PAN
representatives prohibited the entrance of worker
representatives.=20

Representatives then entered by force in to the
Congress Chamber and a confrontation between these
representatives and the National Police or elements of
the Army was anticipated.  In spite of this tension,
the 43 representative PAN block approved the reforms
after almost 11 hours of debate in which the
opposition used all the parliamentary technicalities
possible to impede the reforms from being passed
(Siglo Veintiuno, 24.5.96).  =20

Representatives of the opposition declared the
Guatemalan constitution had been violated with the
military presence in the Legislative Palace and that
the presence constituted a violation of the official
duties of the Executive (Prensa Libre, 24.5.96).  They
expressed their outrage at the fact that it was the
president of the Republic, Alvaro Arz=A3 Irigoyen who
ordered the entrance of the military contingent into
Congress (La Republica, 29.5.96).  =20

TEAMWORK IN THE CAPITAL  =20

We continued with our regular visits and periodic
presences in the offices of popular organisations and
human rights groups in the capital.  We continued to
accompany the workers of the INEXPORT factory, who
continued their presence and labour struggle outside
the illegally closed factory - whose owners refuse to
pay their delayed salaries, and are now threatening to
remove all the machinery from the factory.=20

We also continued to accompany the Association of
Sellers of the Informal Economy in Zone 1 due to the
threats which they have refused for organising. =20

We have maintained a presence with Debora Guzman,
trade union worker form the MJ Modas factory and her
companion Felix Gonzalez  from Amatitl n.  =20

We began daily accompaniment to Blanca Rosa Ayala
Gutierrez, director of the Mirador II settlement in
the capital and leader from the Association of
Squatter Settlements of Guatemala.  Blanca Rosa
suffered an attempted assassination in which she was
shot three times and seriously injured, and is
currently recuperating in a hospital in the capital.=20
 =20

On the streets of the capital  =20
We recently accompanied a march organized by CONAVIGUA
to mark the International Day of Conscientious
Objection and demand the end to militarisation and
forced recruitment.=20

In conjunction with the political revindications
around labour issues, the month has contained a number
of accompaniments of various demonstrations organized
by UASP and other labour organizations which have
taken to the streets to reclaim their right to strike
before the recent approval to the reforms of the
Labour Law Regarding State Worker's Right to Strike.=20
 =20

We also carried out an orientation for the newly
arrived accompaniers from the Spanish Accompaniment
Organisation, Intermon, and saw them off with a dinner
as they left for the community of Aurora 8 of October
in Xaman, Chisec, Alta Verapaz.   =20

We met with Rosalina Tuyuc, director of the National
Coordinating Committee of Guatemalan Widows
(CONAVIGUA) and representative of the FDNG in
Congress.  We gratefully received Monse=A4or Julio
Cabrera, Bishop of the Diocese of Quiche, for an
enjoyable dinner in our home.  =20

IN THE INTERIOR  =20

Izabal: We returned to the communities of Rubelhu and
Rubelpec, in the township of El Estor, who continue to
receive threats and be pressured for their continued
struggle to reclaim their rights.  We also interviewed
Father Daniel Vogt, of the San Pedro Apostal parish,
who has been actively supportive of the communities.=20
=20

Suchitepequez: We travelled to Mazatenango to visit
the director of Radio Victoria, Carlos Orellana, who
was the victim of an assassination attempt when a bomb
exploded in his home.  We also met with the Assistant
in the Regional Ombuds Office for Human Rights (PDH).=20
=20

San Marcos: We again accompanied the lawyers from the
Human Rights Office and Pastoral Team on Land,
conducted appointments with members of the MINUGUA
regional office and the PDH and met with the Union of
State and Popular Sector Workers (UTESP) in the
neighbouring city of San Pedro Sacatepequez.   =20

Quiche: We accompanied the lawyers of CERJ in their
legal work which they continue in Santa Cruz.  In
particular, we accompanied them to a legal function of
"reconstruction of facts" which was carried out in San
Pedro Jocopilas, in an attempt to clarify the details
of an assassinated youth in july of last year.=20
Autodefense patrols as well as an ex-military
commissioner were alleged to be involved.  We also
accompanied members of CONIC on a visit to Lemoa in
Quiche.    =20

AN INTERVIEW WITH ALFONSO BAUER PAIZ:=20
"I HOPE THE POPULAR FORCES CAN REMAIN UNITED"  =20

Born in 1918, one of the activists who fought against
the dictatorship of Ubico, revolutionary of 1944,
holding public positions within the Arevalo and Arbenz
presidencies, twice exiled, and most recently an
esteemed legal advisor of the Guatemalan refugees in
Mexico and the displaced population in general,
Alfonso Bauer Paiz is one of the most well known
political personalities in Guatemala.  =20

>From an historical perspective, a history which you
have personally experienced, what is the greatest
possible advantage offered in the Socio-economic
accord (the most recent accord signed between the
government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary
Unity (URNG) in May of this year) and what is its most
serious disadvantage?=20

The accord did not manage to fulfil the yearnings of
the Guatemalan people, in particular the peasant and
working class. =20

It is positive and legally important that in many of
the precepts of the accord the government acquired
commitments that are tied not only to the current
administration and executive, but to an agent of the
state.  Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the
Congress of the Republic or the Supreme Court of
justice will uphold the accords.  Due to the political
instability of our country it can't be known whether
or not future governments will maintain the
commitments acquired by this administration.=20

However, the latest obligations agreed to by his
government have  consist in the realization of a
series of actions that take in to account the social
needs of the people.  This is the most significant,
and in these commitments one finds some resistance to
the current trends of globalization of the economy and
of neoliberalism.  =20

Now, as for the problematic land issue, the popular
sectors have the impression that very little was
gained.  There are no concrete commitments that attack
the problem of uneven land ownership.  Everything is
made to depend on a land survey that could possibly
take four years to be realized.  Certainly the land
survey could produce valuable information regarding
idle lands, but it will also show that the most
powerful land owners will have their holdings
inscribed in the registry.  And the form in which the
article in the constitution regarding private property
explains land as "inherent to the human personality"
will make expropriations legally difficult. =20

However, one positive note is the mention of a
revision of judgement of the Transversal Fringe of the
North and the Peten.   These lands could be
effectively put to use by awarding them to the peasant
class that have no land.  =20

Finally, I would say that its not possible to
undertake a strong campaign against the accords,
considering the as yet untouched power of the large
land holding class and entrepreneurs organized in the
Coordinating Committee of Agricultural, Commercial,
Industrial and Financial Sectors (CACIF).  There are
some people that would be pleased to see the popular
sectors totally discredit the government and the URNG.=20


The accord should be taken as a first step that
permits a revision of the actual agrarian situation.=20
But something positive will come out of it only if the
peasant population organizes itself, avoiding
divisions and fractures, and struggles in solidarity
with other sectors of the population, such as the
working class, the groups that form the petty
bourgeoisie, intellectuals and professionals to
reclaim its rights.  =20

In the process of the return of Guatemalan refugees,
especially in Mexico, and the resettlement of the
displaced populations in general, there seem to be
many obstacles.  What, essentially, is the problem,
and what possible solutions are there?  =20

In part these obstacles exist because, unfortunately,
there are divisions among the organizations that
represent the refugees, that is, the Permanent
Commission of Guatemalan Refugees in Mexico (CCPP).=20

The accord dealing with the resettlement of the
populations displaced by the internal conflict, signed
on June 27th of 1994, has not been adhered to, with
the exception of the Technical Commission which is in
charge of the diagnostics and profiles of the
projects. =20
The displaced populations - refugees and the
internally displaced - established the Consultative
Assembly of Displaced Populations (ACPD) in September
of 1994, formed by the CCPP, the Communities of
Populations in Resistance (CPR), the National Council
for Displaced Guatemalans (CONDEG), the National
Coordinating Body of Guatemalan Widows (CONAVIGUA),
the Group of Mutual Support for Families of
Disappeared and Detained Persons (GAM), refugees that
have returned from Honduras to Alpemech and refugees
in the USA associated with Atanasio Tzul and the
women's organizations Mama Maquin, Ixmucan=82 and Madre
Tierra (Mother Earth).=20

Regrettably the Northwestern Section of the CCPP as
well as the Southern Section do not attend the
meetings of the ACPD.  These two sections had been
negotiating revisions of the credit arrangement with
the government along side the Northern Section, but
new social realities have arisen, such as in the case
of some refugees in Mexico, members of the
Northwestern Section of the CCPP, who no longer feel
represented by the CCPP, therefore they organized
themselves in a new group called the Coordination of
Blocks for Return and Resettlement of Refugees (CBRR).


Additionaly, the Guatemalan Association of Dispersed
Refugees (ARDIGUA) has existed for several years, but
has been only  partially recognized by the Mexican
Commission for Refuge Aid (COMAR) and the United
Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) even
though there is no doubt that they are refugees.  So,
the authorities of the UNHCR and the National Peace
Fund (FONAPAZ) were exacting pressure so that the
Permanent Commission would endorse ARDIGUA.   =20

On the 24th and 25th of May the ACPD met with the
National Commission for Returnees, Refugees and
Displaced People (CEAR) and FONAPAZ in a "locked door
marathon meeting".  The meeting dealt with the problem
of the legal regulation of credits and the application
of the accords signed on the 8th of October, 1992;
that they should protect the refugees in Mexico,
whether or not they be organized with the CCPP.  The
ACPD emphatically communicated to the government that
they would have no objection to the government
continuing its negotiations with the Northwestern and
Southern Sections of the CCPP.=20

However, they also demanded that the government
negotiate with the ACPD to revise the provisions
regarding credits and the application of the October
accords with the Northern Section of the Permanent
Commission, ARDIGUA, and the CBRR.  To deal with this
problem and all problems of the internally displaced
populations, a permanent table of dialogue was created
under the coordination of a high level functionary of
the government and a representative of the ACPD.  This
is a very notable development.  In the end the ACPD
was left feeling very grateful for the attitude of the
authorities of CEAR and FONAPAZ.=20

They reiterated their proposal and accepted our
proposals with some modifications that we found
reasonable.  With this one can be quite optimistic
that the dialogue will facilitate a solution to the
problems.  =20

On the first day of May of this year the existence of
a new political group, was made known publicly.=20
Calling itself the "Democratic Alternative of the
People" (ADP), it mentioned your name, referring to
you as one of the founders...  =20

I do belong to an organization called the "Popular
Action Group" (GAP).  This group is made up of
politicians from various sectors, unitarians,
pluralists and politicians of the left, yes, but with
criteria sufficiently broad in nature so as to promote
in our country the uniting of all the forces of the
left and popular democratic forces, including
representatives of the economic sector who understand
the need for certain transformations and changes.  The
GAP participated along with other sectors in the
creation of the Democratic Front for a New Guatemala
(FDNG).=20

Other organizations such as those in the Indigenous
sector and the union movement also participated.=20
There had been a decision made by consensus which
proposed the following individuals as possible
presidential candidates for the FDNG: Oscar Clemente
Marroquin Godoy, Gert Rosenthal, Alfonso Fuente Soria,
Dr. Argueta Figueroa y Alfonso Bauer Paiz.  However,
it turned it out that on a given day, a fax arrived
from Mexico City, saying that the economist Jorge
Gonzalez del Valle was accepting the nomination as the
presidential candidate.  A nomination that had not
even been discussed here in Guatemala, not even once!=20

It was then that I understood that this came from
outside decisions, and I understood that there had
already been a specific (political) line, and I
resigned.  The GAP supported my decision, advising me
at no time do we want to cause divisions among the
FDNG.=20

We were a fundamental factor in its creation and we
remain committed to the FDNG in a moral way.  We did
not want to participate in the electoral event, but we
announced that if the moment arrives to revise the
Constitution of the Republic, yes we'll be there in
the struggle to elect deputies to the Constituent
Assembly.  This Assembly should demand new norms for
the true establishment of a democracy that is
pluralist, participatory and socially just.   =20

As far as my participation in the ADP I can only tell
you that this is absolutely false.  The day after the
notice was published in the Prensa Libre, Factor
Mendez and I sent a statement of explanation in which
we said that we are members of the GAP, that we
support the FDNG and declare our participation for
reasons that deal with hegemonic and hierarchical
attitudes that had been (present), but that we
continue struggling so that the Democratic Front might
strengthen the unity of the popular forces.  In no way
do we want to be divisive.  For us, despite its
limitations, the Democratic Front is the only popular
(political) expression. =20

The mention of our names was done with absolutely no
consultation and it is painful that the Prensa Libre
has not published the clarification.  =20

What is your vision of the political panorama in
Guatemala between the signing of the peace and the
year 2,000?   =20

It is very restless.  I am not a pessimistic fatalist,
in some way I have maintain a fairly utopian outlook
since my adolescence and youth, utopian in the sense
of Tomas Moro in the Middle Ages, and of Che Guevara
in recent times.  But given the concrete realities,
and the prospects that lie between now and the year
2000, I fear that upon signing the peace accords, the
organizations that form the URNG, might constitute a
volatile group, and that a reoccurrence of what
happened in El Salvador and in Nicaragua with the FMLN
and the Sandanistas, could result. In [these cases]
the great forces of economic power and the military
remain in tact.  I hope that all of this does not
occur [in Guatemala] and that the popular forces as
well as the political-military forces of the
insurgency maintain their unity.=20

Dear Jagdish:
Please circulate widely....
----------------------------India: Campaigns------------------------
As case studies show, organisations and individuals in India have 
used a variety of approaches in their campaigns against TNCs. In 
addition to the legal approaches and lobbying, they've staged rallies 
and demonstrations, sit-ins, blockades, public meetings and street 
theatre.
Groups such as JAN NATYA MANCH (8, Vittalbhai Patel House, Rafi Marg, 
New Delhi 110001. Contact: M. Hashmi) and NISHANT NATYA MANCH (A-2/15 
Model Town, Delhi-110009. Contact: Shamsul Islam) put on interesting 
and humourous street plays to inform people about TNCs as well as 
GATT and World Bank issues. These groups have organised hundreds of 
street plays throughout India.
Other groups have produced posters, pamphlets, leaflets, newsletters, 
and books to get the word out about their cause. Activists have also 
used the mainstream regional language press to disseminate 
information about TNCs; often, these publications are more supportive 
of TNC campaigns than the national English-language newspapers.
In this regard, the feature service in Hindi which AZADI BACHAO 
ANDOLAN, SARVODAYA PRESS SERVICE (29 Samvada Nagar, Navlakha, Indore 
452004. Contact: Mahendra Bhai), and the PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH 
GROUP, bring out, have been extremely helpful in educating people in 
rural and remote areas of India about transnationals.
Many other Indian organisations and individuals have campaigned on or

Alabama State Senator Charles Davidson, a Republican candidate
for the United States House of Representatives, defends slavery
as God's will, citing the Bible (Leviticus:  "You may acquire
male and female slaves from the pagan nations that are around
you").  In a speech he said:  "People who are bitter and hateful
about slavery are obviously bitter and hateful against God and
his word, because they reject what God says and embrace what mere
humans say concerning slavery...This humanistic thinking is what
the abolitionists embraced."

      AFGHANISTAN: HUMANITARIAN AID FINALLY GETS THROUGH

In late May 1996, the International Committee of the Red Cross
was able to bring a relief convoy, the first since April 1994,
down from the northern town of Mazar-i-Sharif to the war-torn
capital city of Kabul. This involved driving five lorries loaded
with 75 tonnes of vegetable oil (an essential cooking ingredient
in Afghanistan as in most of Southern Asia) across the Hindu Kush
mountains; the route included the notorious Salang Pass tunnel
which, at close to three thousand metres above sea level, is one
of the highest in the world. Apart from the fact that until then
the Salang road had been closed by a particularly active front
line, a 2.4 km stretch of the road was known to be mined. In a
gesture of humanitarian concern both the Kabul authorities and
the Jumbesh, the political militia based in the northern part of
the country, agreed to let this section of the front be cleared
of mines.

The mine-removal operation was carried out by Afghan specialists 
recruited and trained by the British-based Halo Trust
organization. As an additional gesture of goodwill, both parties
allowed 60 civilians to cross the front line in the wake of the
convoy as it returned north laden with orthopaedic equipment to
manufacture prostheses for landmine victims there.

Apart from seeing an additional overland lifeline opened up for
the one million inhabitants of Kabul, the ICRC staff accompanying
the convoy were surprised and encouraged by the spontaneous
reaction from local people along the route. "People came up
waving flags and cheering us on", said Jean-Paul Jacquod, head of
sub-delegation in Mazar-i-Sharif. "We really had the impression
that more than a convoy had got through that time... we feel we
saw the emergence of a renewed feeling of hope."

                  DANGEROUS COMPUTER VIRUSES

PAT BUCHANAN VIRUS: Your system works fine, but it complains
loudly about foreign software; inexplicably defends slavery and
laughs like a wounded animal.

O.J. SIMPSON VIRUS: You know it's guilty but your anti-virus
program is too stupid to understand the scientific evidence.

NEWT GINGRICH VIRUS: It divorced it's wife virus on her cancer
bed, failed to pay child-support, and now lectures your system
about "family values."

BOB DOLE VIRUS: Could be virulent, but it's so old you secretly
hope it will self-destruct, because you really don't want to
support the Bill Clinton virus.

BILL CLINTON VIRUS:  Perceived as being liberal (but not by
liberals).  This virus will tell you what you want to hear and
then do the opposite.  It apparently is sociopathic...doing
whatever it takes to replicate itself.

BORIS YELTSIN VIRUS:  Erratic to the point of appearing drunk. 
This virus cloaks itself in the image of democracy but actually
ruins your system like a dictator.

NIKE VIRUS: Ships your files to countries where child labor can
keep track of them.  

KATHY LEE GIFFORD VIRUS:  Almost identical to the Nike Virus,
only it cries and whines when discovered.

       EXPLOSION AND FIRE AT POINT BEACH NUCLEAR PLANT

Loading of spent nuclear fuel into dry storage containers was
suspended at the Point Beach, Wisconsin, USA  Nuclear Plant
following an explosion during a welding procedure May 28, 1996. 
According to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) initial report, at 2:45 am on May 28th, an unidentified gas
ignited inside a fully-loaded cask of nuclear waste containing 14
tons of spent fuel rods, causing an explosion.  The explosion
occurred just prior to the welding of the 9 inch thick cask lid
that weighs about 4,400 pounds.  The explosion inside the cask
lifted the 2 ton lid, leaving it tipped at an angle with one edge
1 inch higher than normal.  There were no injuries.

The NRC has suspended further loading of nuclear waste casks
until it can determine the cause of the accident and whether any
spent fuel rods were damaged by the explosion.  Each 18 foot high
cask is loaded with 14 tons of radioactive waste, including 170
pounds of plutonium.  Each loaded silo contains the equivalent
radioactivity of 240 Hiroshima-type explosions.  According to
U.S. guidelines, the waste must be kept safe for 10,000 years.

The explosion confirms environmental groups' concerns that the
VSC-24 dry cask storage system has not been sufficiently reviewed
to protect public health and the environment.  This radioactive
waste storage explosion demonstrates the real threat to the Great
Lakes ecosystem.

      STREET CHILDREN MURDERED IN GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS

WITNESS, a project of the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights
provides the following report.
nyc@lchr.org
<a href=http://witness.org>http://witness.org</a>

According to Casa Alianza, street children are being kidnaped,
tortured, jailed, and murdered in Guatemala and Honduras. These
unconscionable crimes are seemingly condoned by the state
governments.  The following was taken from Casa Alianza's recent
report on street children: 

GUATEMALA: 

In Guatemala, the major perpetrators torturing and murdering
street children are uniformed officers of the Guatemala
security forces and the national police.  These street children,
parentless, homeless, often resorting to prostitution or theft,
are easy targets. Bodies of murdered children are found with
grotesque wounds created by unspeakable tortures. 

The tragic case of Nahaman Carmon Lopez is typical of the plight
of the defenseless street children. Late one night, a group of 10
street children were standing on a street corner sniffing glue --
something street children often do to forget their hunger and the
cold. Shortly after midnight four uniformed National Policemen
passing by noticed the children. One pulled out his gun and
ordered the children to stay where they were. Six escaped, four
did not. Nahaman was one of these unlucky four. The policemen
tortured the children by pouring the bags of plastic glue, toxic
liquid, over the heads and into the eyes of the children.
Nahaman, who was the eldest child at 13, tried to resist. Nahaman
was beaten by the four policeman and left lying on the street.
Nahaman was taken to a hospital by the other children.  Despite
the doctors' efforts, Nahaman died ten days later with 6 broken
ribs, bruising over 60% of his body, and a ruptured liver. 

The older children are also defenseless against these attacks. A
group of boys aged 15-20 were picked up in a parking lot by four
armed members of the National Police in a truck. They were
handcuffed and taken away.  Several days later their mutilated
bodies were found in a remote area outside Guatemala City. Their
eyes had been burned out, their ears and tongues were severed,
and some of the boys' bodies revealed burns created by boiling
liquid having been poured over their body parts. Each of the boys
had ultimately died by a shot to the back of the head. Casa
Alianza tried to sue the policeman involved in Guatemalan courts.
There was very damaging evidence to convict the policemen,
including evidence that the deadly bullets had been fired from
the guns of two of the National Policemen, but the Judge trying
the case did not admit this evidence. The four policeman were
found not guilty. Casa Alianza appealed this case to the
Guatemalan Supreme Court, but the decision was not reversed. In
the fall of 1995, Casa Alianza submitted pictorial evidence of
the boys' bodies to the United Nations Committee Against Torture,
and to the Inter American Commission of Human Rights (IAHR). The
case is presently being investigated by the IAHR. 

HONDURAS:

In contravention of the Honduran Constitution and international
law, minors are being kept in prisons with adult prisoners in
Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, Honduras. These children are easy
targets of older adult prisoners. Two boys named Geovanny
Fransisco Jako ?) and his brother Carlos Enrique (also 17) were
arrested. No charges were laid, and there was no conviction. The
boys had been living with their mother. They were taken to a San
Pedro prison in the small town of Choloma, and were held together
with adult male prisoners who had been convicted of rape, murder
and theft. 

Geovanny and his brother Carlos witnessed the physical and sexual
abuse of other boys by the adult male prisoners. Both brothers
were stabbed by an adult male prisoner, referred to as El Chino
Machete, during a verbal argument. Carlos died later that day as
a result of the stab wound. Three days later, Geovanny was
released. 

Geovanny is now 19. He is back at home with his mother and is
struggling to support them. He told Bruce Harris of Casa Alianza:
"I miss my brother.  And it's even harder now...how can I earn
myself what the two of us used to earn together?" 

CASA ALIANZA:

Casa Alianza is working to bring the murderers of hundreds of
street children to justice. They use their Witness cameras to
document evidence and testimonies. They then submit this
videotaped evidence to national courts, and international bodies
like the U.N. Committee Against Torture and the Inter American
Commission Against Human Rights. 

Through their shelters and their work programs for street
children, Casa Alianza has helped thousands of street children in
Guatemala. Casa Alianza is using its Witness camera to record the
construction of new prisons in Honduras and is investigating the
torture of children illegally jailed with adults in the Honduran
Comayaguan jail in November 1995. 


Casa Alianza asks that you please consider writing a letter to
help protect street children. Here is a sample letter: 

URGENT ACTION 

Lic. Alvaro Arzu
President of the Republic of Guatemala
Palacio Nacional
Cd de Guatemala, Guatemala
Central America

Dear President Arzu:

For the past six years, dozens of homeless street children have
been hunted down, beaten, often tortured and many murdered. The
principal perpetrators of these shameful acts have been uniformed
members of the National Police. 

In June 1990, two National Policemen illegally kidnaped, tortured
and then murdered four street children in Guatemala City. They
later killed yet another boy -- shooting him in the back. Despite
irrefutable evidence, the two policemen were released by the
courts. This case is now before the InterAmerican Commission of
Human Rights, part of the Organization of American States. 

I would like to insist upon your ordering an immediate
investigation into the torture and murder of street children by
the National Police and to prosecute the perpetrators to the full
extent of the law. I recognize that most of these attacks against
the children have not been committed during your Presidency, but
now that you have assumed such a position, I believe that it is
your responsibility to investigate, prosecute and condemn those
responsible for these hideous acts. 

Yours sincerely, 

YOUR NAME

         FEMINIZATION OF POWER IN FRANCE AND INDIA

On June 6th, 1996, ten women politicians in France launched a 
feminization of power campaign to increase the number of women in
politics through a constitutional amendment. Only 5.5 percent
France's National Assembly and 5.6 of its Senate (upper house)
are made up of women. While parliaments in 54 European nations
and North America had an average of 16 percent of seats
occupied by women in 1985, that number fell to 11 percent in
1994. Last May, French Prime Minister Alain Juppe named a record
12 women to his cabinet but later dismissed eight because he
said they lacked political clout. Juppe said he would consider
the idea of a national referendum on a constitutional revision,
but noted that the "Equality Watch" he set up last year was
studying the issue. 

A recent opinion poll conducted for the weekly L'Express, which
also published the women politicians announcement, found that the
French people overwhelmingly support gender equity, with 77
percent in favor of rewriting the constitution to add the
principle of gender equity in politics and 82 percent in favor of
a national referendum to achieve political equality. Seventy-one
percent felt equality in general society would be aided by
equality in politics. 

In India June 5th, 1996, the new coalition government said it
would reserve one third of all Parliament seats and a third of
all government jobs for women. It also announced it would review
laws to remove discrimination against women.

TV PORN -- AMERICA'S BIGGEST EXPORT TO INDIA

EDITOR'S NOTE: The U.S. news media dutifully monitors India's electoral 
politics on the premise that the public arena is where American 
democratic values are exerting their most profound impact. But all across 
the subcontinent, Indian families who deeply disapprove of public kissing 
crowd around satellite-transmitted TV sit-coms showing bedroom sex. Far 
from trying to control it, India's state owned television is trying to 
cash in on the act. PNS commentator Andrew Robinson is an American writer 
who lives and works in South Asia.

BY ANDREW ROBINSON, PACIFIC NEWS SERVICE

VISHAKAPATNAM, INDIA -- In a middle-class neighborhood of this 
average-sized city (pop. 900,000) on India's eastern coast, I'm watching 
television in my neighbor's house and asking my hosts -- a middle-aged 
man wearing a dhoti, his sari-clad wife and three daughters -- to change 
the channel. The current selection reveals two American women engaged in 
a furious wrestling match, one in a hole-punched lycra bathing suit, the 
other in a gold and silver leotard that purposely reveals her right 
buttock.

"Is this a popular sport in your country?" asks my host, smirking.

The youngest daughter selects another channel. Click. Three bikinied 
women, armed with life guard buoys, run across a beach. Click. Donahue 
asks, "So then you called your daughter on the telephone and told her to 
stop dating your boyfriend?" Click. Madonna fingering herself.

Just three years ago, none of this existed in India, a mostly 
family-oriented country where on-screen kissing is considered 
pornographic and public displays of flesh and affection are frowned upon. 
Imported Hollywood films (largely censored) and their lurid 
advertisements have always offered Indian audiences a sexually 
hyperactive rendition of Americans. But today's abundant television sets, 
satellite linked even in poor households and watched mostly by children, 
are making the image more prevalent -- and more profane -- than ever 
before.

"What are these young boys thinking?" asks Vijaya Laxmi, a local 
homemaker, about the new generation of satellite television viewers in 
Indian. "Here I am, in my forties, and I can't even look at the images 
they're watching. I feel too ashamed."

While in the U.S. various groups have mobilized to curb sex and violence 
on television, no such well-organized movement exists in India. Even 
once-fervently protectionist Hindu fundamentalist politicians no longer 
campaign against the invasion of western culture.

Such a platform would be politically disastrous. Baywatch, an American 
television serial depicting the scantily clad lifeguards, was rated the 
most popular television show in India this year (The Bold and the 
Beautiful, a well-known American soap opera, was second). Lured by these 
high ratings, and eager to compete in the rapidly expanding market of 
private television channels, the state-owned television channel, 
Doordarshan, has decided to dub Baywatch into regional Indian languages 
-- a procedure usually reserved for high quality national programs.

"Most of the dialogue will be untranslatable," says Surendranath Talla, a 
Telugu computer engineer who has lived in the U.S. for many years. "The 
phrase 'my Dad's girlfriend,' for example, would sound absurd in Telugu. 
There's no concept for such a thing. But what does it matter? For the 
townspeople and villagers who watch these programs, it's all a kind of 
craziness anyway -- a cross between the naked African bodies in a 
National Geographic special and some carnival freakshow."

Even Schindler's List was received in India as a pornographic adult film, 
and the young men who lined up to see it were more eager to catch a 
glimpse of the "naked women exposed to merciless humiliations and rapes" 
(as advertised in the movie posters) than explore the horrifying 
dimensions of the Holocaust. As everyone knows throughout the 
subcontinent, American entertainment is nothing more than an elaborate 
charade whose sole purpose is to undress the female form.

"What local people don't realize," complains an American scholar living 
in Benares, "is that they're getting a very distorted view of the West." 
The scholar compares the sexual harassment she faces on city streets to 
"walking through a minefield."

But this tele-distortion of the culture no doubt exerts its most adverse 
effects not on American tourists but on India itself -- a country that 
looks to the West as the paragon of modernization.

"There is no human failure greater than to launch a profoundly important 
endeavor and then leave it half done," wrote the noted British economist 
Barbara Ward in the 1960s. "This is what the West has done ... It shook 
all the societies in the world loose from their old moorings. But it 
seems indifferent whether or not they reach safe harbor in the end."

So is fake female wrestling a popular sport in my country? I'm still 
trying to think of an appropriate answer to that question. Being the de 
facto emissary of the country with the most powerful media in the world 
often leaves one speechless and blushing -- with a lot of explaining to 
do.

Why Sub-Commission membership bid failed

Jakarta Post, 20 May 1996
Abridged

POOR RECORD SHUTS RI OUT OF UN RIGHTS 
COMMISSION

Indonesia's poor human rights record is one of the main 
reasons why its candidates were not elected to the UN Sub-
Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and the 
Protection of Minorities, a candidate said.

Human rights campaigner Muladi told JP the country's poor 
human rights protection image was an obstacle to get an 
Indonesian on the Commission.

Last year, Jakarta nominated Charles Himawan to sit on the 
Commission with Muladi as his deputy. In Geneva earlier this 
month, the Indonesian candidates lost out to nominees from 
Japan and South Korea for one of the 16 seats.

Muladi, rector of Diponegoro University, Semarang, said it is 
important for the country to dispel the negative perception by 
working to improve human rights across the country. Apart 
from its notoriety, Jakarta's efforts were further obstructed by 
the international campaign against Indonesia being waged by 
East Timorese separatist leaders such as Ramos Horta.

Despite intensive lobbying by the Foreign Affairs Ministry's 
Director General of General and Political Affairs and 
Indonesia's permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, 
only 20 of the expected 38 supporting votes came in.

He also said the dominant role of the US in such proceedings 
was another negative factor. 'The US was very inflexible 
towards Indonesia,' charged Muladi, who is a member of the 
National Commission for Human Rights and has also sat on 
the UN Committee on  Crime Prevention of Criminal Justice.

Subject: EAST TIMOR: Confessions of A Spy
Date: 28 May 1996 11:22:00

                           EAST TIMOR REPORT:
             an intelligence informant confesses.


                         28 May 1996


The flow of information on the oppressive conditions in East Timor
reaching the outside world has noticeably diminished in the recent
past.   The Indonesian military has taken increased repressive
measures aimed at preventing the world from following the true
situation in the illegally occupied territory. The prominent
international exposure in recent years of the barbaric conduct of the
Indonesian military in East Timor and Indonesia itself, has seriously
damaged the positive image the Suharto regime and its foreign
backers have tried to cultivate for so long. World wide attention on
East Timor has exposed the brutal nature of the Indonesian
occupation, the criminal character of the regime's military and its
corrupt and inefficient public administration.

After some blows in recent months, the East Timorese
Resistance information network is reorganising itself and
succeeding again in providing information to the outside world on
the worsening conditions in the oppressed territory.

The following  report on the confessions of a young East Timorese
spy has been just received. This case story is typical of the
experiences many young East Timorese, intimidated and coerced
to report on their fellows by the large numbers of
Indonesian military intelligence operatives stationed in the territory.

Through these pressures on the territory's youth to spy on their
people and report to the occupying forces, a very pernicious
climate of fear and division is maintained in East Timor, which
further exacerbates the sufferings of this traumatised society.


              I WAS FORCED TO SPY ON THE CHURCH

 (statement by Carlos da Conceicao(*), 20 years, of Baguia, East
                           Timor).

This  bright faced young man was among those attending the
inauguration ceremony of the Salesian Sisters convent in Laga
parish, on the evening of 29 April 96.  Rather than returning that
evening to his home village in Baguia, he stayed behind to monitor
the several hundred parishioners from the surrounding regions that
could not make it home and had to stay in Laga overnight.

The next day, on his way to Baguia he stopped at the village of
Lavateri, looking for the leader of the Catholic youth. Because the
people knew the visitor to be an Indonesian spy, they avoided
giving him the information he desired. Instead, some youngsters
chased him away. He was detained by other youths some 2
kilometres away, and brought back to Lavateri. On 1 May, the  local
Priest of Laga, Father Joao de Deus Pires,  came to see Carlos da
Conceicao, and seek information from him on his work as a spy for
the Indonesian military intelligence.

In front of the local military commander (Dan Pos) Muh-Arfa, the
Village Head, Deputy Sub-district Head, the Priest, and two Church
employees, Carlos stated that he was forced by the local
military commander to work as a spy. He was ordered to monitor
the activities of the Catholic Church, particularly its youth.  He had
to report the names of all young people participating in Church
activities, monitor the movements of the Catholic school teachers,
and take part in all Church gatherings involving large numbers of
people, reporting on them.  Carlos claimed that he disliked
performing this work, but was forced to do so by the Dan Pos Muh-
Arfa.

Hearing this statement, the embarrassed local military commander
Muh-Arfa claimed  in front of the Priest that he had never ordered
Carlos to work as a spy.  Father Pires replied to Muh-Arfa that he
had not come to judge anyone, but to hear a statement from Carlos
about his activities.  Therefore, the Priest added, Muh-Arfa's
statement was not relevant to him.  Father Pires felt the duty to
report  Carlos' statement to the Bishop, especially considering that
the priest had himself been aware of how he had been constantly
spied upon while performing his pastoral duties.

After a heated discussion, Muh-Arfa finally acknowledged that he
had indeed ordered Carlos to spy for the military.  Father Pires
asked him to avoid continuing to disturb the people of Baguia in
future with terror and intimidation.  The priest then left for Laga
taking Carlos da Conceicao with him, to bring him to the Bishop in
Dili.

At Laga, Carlos admitted to Church workers that he had been
spying for the military since 1990. He had for a long time dreamed
to be able to free himself from the situation he was trapped in, and
was very happy at what had happened that day. He now felt
relieved that it was all in the open.  His only concern was that the
military may try to kill him for exposing them. The Church workers
assured him that he would be protected.

Japan YWCA urges Sweden to stop arms export

The National Board of the YWCA of Japan, meeting
in Tokyo from May 25-7, adopted a resolution urging
the Swedish Government to reverse its decision to permit
the sale of naval cannons to Indonesia. 

Reiko Suzuki, Secretary General of the Japan YWCA,
conveyed the resolution in a letter to Foreign Minister
Lena Hjelm Wallen that said, in part,

"In the light of resolution adopted at the YWCA World Council
in July 1995 in Seoul, Korea, with respect to East Timor:

'.Recognizing that the 20-year old Indonesian occupation
and the horrendous systematic violations of human rights 
are in contradiction of the UN International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,
be it resolved that all national associations mobilize to
advocate for an immediate prohibition on arms sales to
Indonesia, the immediate withdrawal of Indonesia from East Timor,
and the participation of East Timorese leaders in the current UN-sponsored
talks between the Indonesian and Portuguese governments.' 

and, with respect to the Resolution on the Discontinuation of
Munitions Trade which, inter alia,

'(Condemns) the continuation of the conventional munitions 
and chemical weapons trade and calls on all national associations
to work with other relevant organizations to ensure change
in government policies, practices and public opinion so that
this trade be discontinued globally.'

the National Board of the YWCA of Japan urges the Government
of Sweden to:

1) withdraw approval for the sale/export of naval cannons to Indonesia,
2) reaffirm the policy adopted by the Social Democratic Party not to
permit arms sales to Indonesia, and
3) to respect the rights of the East Timorese which have been reaffirmed
in resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly
and to make utmost efforts in the diplomatic field to achieve a peaceful
resolution of the East Timor issue."

The letter was presented to the Swedish Embassy in Tokyo.
The YWCA delegation was informed by the counsellor that the Embassy
had received no information on the arms sale to date.

1/1     AUSTRALIA TO SHARE RADAR INTELLIGENCE WITH INDONESIA 

THE Australian Defence Force is set to share top secret intelligence
information with Indonesia as part of an effort to establish closer
military ties with Australia's giant norther neighbour.

The armed forces plan to share information from Australia's $1
billion Jindalee over-the-horizon radar network as part of a "joint
surveillence regime" of the air and sea gap between the two
countries. 

The move has been hailed as a significant step on top of last year's
defence cooperation treaty with Indonesia. Australian Defence Force
chief General John Baker said today the proposal had been raised in
talks with senior officers from Indonesia's military, ABRI. "If we
are going to cooperate in surveillence of the area between Australia
and the Indonesia archipelago you can't do it unless you see the
basic information on which your activities are generated," General
Baker said. "I think we will share some of the basic output from
Jindalee in future as we get into cooperative activities." Australia
already engages in joint surveillance with Malaysia using jets from
the RAAF base at Butterworth, near the northern Malaysian city of
Penang. General Baker said today both Australia and Indonesia
experienced problems with pirates, illegal fishers and other illegal
vessels. Meanwhile Prime Minister John Howard is expected to travel
to Jakarta in early August in what will be his first trip overseas as
Prime Minister. Sources said today that Howard was likely to travel
on to Japan after visiting Indonesia and holding talks with President
Suharto. His planned trips follows last month's visit by Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer, last week's trip by Deputy Prime Minister
Tim Fischer and a proposed visit by Defence Minister Ian McLachlan
in mid-June. His predecessor Paul Keating made six trips to Jakarta
in less than four years.

Indonesia no intent to annex E. Timor

    JAKARTA, May 28 (UPI) -- Indonesia President Suharto on Tuesday
said his country has (sic) no intention of annexing the former
Portuguese colony of East Timor. 
    Instead, he told Burkina Faso President Blaise Compoare that 
"Indonesia has entirely no ambition to annex any other region
because our constitution is very clear...independence is the right
of all nations." 
    Indonesia state secretariate Murdiono told reporters that
Suharto also noted that in terms of territory, East Timor is only a
very small region compared to Indonesia's vast territory. 
    "Definitely, there is no logical reason for Indonesia to annex
such a small territory," Murdiono said. "It was the East Timorese
people who expressed their will of their own future to integrate
into Indonesia." 
    Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, invaded
the predominantly Roman Catholic East Timor in December 1975 in the
wake of a civil war between left-wing and right-wing indigenous
forces that broke out after Portugal ended its colonial rule.
Jakarta declared East Timor its 27th province in 1976. 
    Twenty-years later, however, the East Timor issue remained a
political barb for Jakarta. The United Nations and many Western
countries refused to recognize the move, and regard Portugal as the
administrative power in the territory.

ABRI Troops Catch East Timor Separatist Rebel

Indonesia Media Network (IMN), May 28, 1996
<a href=http://www.imn.co.id/today/9605/28/28DILI.IMN-e.html>http://www.imn.co.id/today/9605/28/28DILI.IMN-e.html</a>

Dili -- The Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) troops had recently caught
a member of the East Timor Separatist Movement (GPK), Geronimo Soares
(31) in the Fatubolu village, Hatolioa subdistrict, Ermera regency.

"Geronimo Soares was ambushed and caught on May 23, 1996 in the
Fatubolu village, Hatolia subdistrict, Ermera regency," said Commander
of Wiradharma Military Command, Col. (Inf.) Mahidin Simbolon in Dili
Monday.

According to Simbolon, Soares, who is dubbed "The long-haired," is a
member of the East Timor GPK from the group which is led by "Sahen"
who wanders in the forests and on the mountain near the Ermera
regency.

"The GPK members of this region is getting weaker and always moves
from one place to another, but we kept on chasing after them," said
Simbolon.

According to Simbolon, the East Timor GPK, both those who surrendered
or caught, before returned to the people were supplied with an
archipelago and national protection concept.

"The archipelago concept which was given to the East Timor GPK before
being returned to the people are shown by our natural behavior so that
they can directly see the form," said Simbolon.

Abilio: Portugal Only Left Us with Stupidity and Poverty

<a href=http://www.imn.co.id/today/9605/29/29DILI.TXT-e.html>http://www.imn.co.id/today/9605/29/29DILI.TXT-e.html</a>
Indonesia Media Network (IMN), May 29

Dili -- East Timor Governor Abilio Jose Osorio Soares said, that the
colonial government of Portugal that colonialized East Timor for 450
years, only left a legacy of stupidity and poverty so that the society
had at one time been left very far behind compared to the other 26
provinces of Indonesia.

Governor Abilio said this in a written address which was read by the
Third Assistant of the Regional Secretary of East Timor Abel Dos
Santos Fatima at the meeting of Social Organizations from Jakarta in
cooperation with the Christian Children fund Foundation (CCF) in Dili,
Tuesday.

He said, the colonialism done by Portugal was the most cruel in the
world, because the Portuguese did not educate the people in their
colony so that they can develop.

Because of the colonialism of Portugal, until now the stupidity,
poverty, and backwardness of the people of East Timor can still be
seen and all of that has become the source of the social problems.

The CCF Foundation group led by Sister Flora Situmorang, KYM was in
East Timor to observe the various joint projects with the East Timor
Regional Government in social welfare that has been done for a couple
of years.

Rapid growth

According to Abilio, since East Timor integrated with Indonesia for
the past 20 years has experienced quite a rapid growth.

Touching on the matters faced by this area, the governor said that
they are quite complex.

He gave an example of the program that succeeded in other provinces
may not necessarily work in a condition and situation like the one in
East Timor, so n alternative that is consistent with the condition of
the local area must be found.

In this opportunity, the governor hoped that the CCF Foundation can
increase the review and research of the social problems in East Timor,
so that in the future can develop the programs better and more
consistent with the local surroundings.

"Besides that, the cooperation between the Regional Government of East
Timor with CCF Foundation will be an example for other foundations in
Indonesia," said Abilio Jose Osorio Soares.

Sr. Flora Situmorang, KYM as the Coordinator of the Project , in her
address said that the visit of CCF in this area is to increase the
cooperate with the local government.

The Form of cooperation includes in the sectors of health, education,
environment, and clean water and also economic development.

Subject: Indonesian letter to an East Timore
Date: 30 May 1996 12:26:00

Some days ago we published on email an address given by student activist
Cesarina Rocha, an East Timorese exile living in Darwin, who participated at
the Kawangju International Youth Camp for Human Rights and Peace, held in South
Korea from 14 to 20 May 96.

The following message written to Cesarina by an Indonesian person who read her
Kwangju adddress on email has just been received. It very clearly and
eloquently expresses the growing awareness of the people of Indonesia about the
reality in East Timor, and its links to their own suffering under the Suharto
dictatorship.

The letter (which has only been slighly edited to improve its english) shows
the growing understanding of the Indonesian people that the same regime which
oppresses them, and from whose grip they are longing to be freed, is
responsible for the ongoing East Timor tragedy.

It is interesting to note how Indonesians, such as the author of the letter,
hope that international awareness of the aspirations for freedom of the
Indonesian people may be heightened through greater exposure of the oppression
in East Timor.

*******************
Dear Cesarina,

        Thank you for your "very interesting & touchy" mail. It certainly
makes me realize what has become of life these days, especially with the
presence of military oppression, tortures etc ..

        It is time for you and your friends to be more & more aggressive in
telling the world (especially the people of Indonesia) about what has been
really happening in Timor Leste. I know that this is no easy work. But
somebody has to do it !

Perhaps if you could include some photos or even films that captured the
horrible events, the Indonesians will open their eyes and give more and more
support to you and your friends.

You mentioned about Max Stahl documentary, how can we get a copy of that ?
Can you please find out for me ? This type of "live evidence" will certainly
give firm assurance to us Indonesians.

I noticed that there is one prominent Indonesian 'politician-in-exile', Mr.
George Aditjondro, currently living in Newcastle (NSW) who  ocassionally
writes some articles regarding East Timor. It will be nice if you could also
get in touch with him. (I don't know him personally, but judging from his
writing, he is a  very knowledgable person in terms of Indonesian political
issues).

Right now, it's not just the Timor Leste people that are fighting for their
freedom, the Indonesians are too. We are fighting for a true democracy
(Not Democracy Pancasila !)

My prayer will always be with you. Keep in mind that God works in His
mysterious way....

cheers

Our groups have been in contact for the past few months with the aim of 
organising some form of co-ordinated international action in support of 
East Timor. We would like to hear from anyone, student or non student, 
who could help us to make contacts with students/ student groups who 
may be interested in taking part.

We have not set a date for these actions yet, but we are considering the 
12th November. We hope that we can encourage people to get involved and 
that this will lead to the formation of more student groups in support of 
East Timor.

Belo interview in UK Readers Digest

An article entitled 'East Timor's Reluctant Hero', based on an 
interview of Bishop Belo by Australian-based editor, Paul 
Raffaele, which was published in the April edition of the 
Asian Readers Digest, has been published in the June UK 
edition of the monthly magazine.

With just a few stylistic amendments, the contents are the 
same as the article published in the Asian edition. The text 
was posted on reg.easttimor on 4 April.  

The article is scheduled to appear in other European-
language editions in the coming months.

The article will also appear in the July issue of the Hongkong 
edition.

There are no plans as yet to publish it in the US edition.

The front section of the June edition also includes an article, 
under the 'Behind the Lines' rubric, entitled: 'Meet Us at Ten 
O'Clock Tonight'. This is the same version as that published 
in the Asian edition.

The publication of this article in the Asian Edition resulted in 
the magazine being banned in Indonesia.

UA 133/96        Fear of Ill-Treatment       31 May 1996
 
INDONESIA         269 Vietnamese asylum-seekers 
 
Amnesty International fears that 269 Vietnamese asylum-seekers,
detained by the Indonesian authorities in the state prison in
Tanjung Pinang, on the island of Bintan, are at risk of
ill-treatment.  The 269 people had their asylum claims considered
and rejected and are due to be repatriated to Viet Nam within the
next two months.  According to reports, the Indonesian military
authorities have isolated the 269 people from the main group of more
than 4,000 Vietnamese, because they have actively opposed the
repatriation process.  The isolation of the 269 asylum-seekers
places them at greater risk of ill-treatment. 
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
 
Members of the security forces in Indonesia, both the police and the
army, frequently resort to excessive force and ill-treatment in
dealing with protestors, asylum-seekers and other individuals in
detention. In April 1996, military officers were filmed beating and
kicking East Timorese asylum-seekers who had attempted to flee
Indonesia via the German Embassy in Jakarta. Also in April, student
riots in Ujung Pandang, Sulawesi, resulted in the deaths of up to
six students following military intervention on several university
campuses. Local human rights groups claim that the security forces
used excessive force in handling the riots. Labour and land
demonstrations are frequently broken up with the use of force
including beating with sticks and kicking.  Individuals in detention
are at greater risk, particularly those without access to
independent lawyers.  
 
Thousands of people left Viet Nam during the late 1970s and 1980s. 
Many of these people have since been resettled in Western countries. 
However, the numbers of people who left, and concerns that people
were not refugees but economic migrants led an international
agreement in 1989, known as the Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA),
to deal with the problem of migration from Viet Nam and Laos.  Under
the terms of the CPA, asylum-seekers were screened to establish
whether or not they were refugees fleeing persecution. Those found
to be refugees were resettled in third countries; those
"screened-out" would have to return to Viet Nam or Laos, under a
voluntary repatriation scheme.  The CPA is coming to an end, with
funding from the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees) for refugee camps across southeast Asia ending on 30 June
1996.  Efforts to speed up the repatriation process in these
countries have been met with fierce resistance from the Vietnamese,
who do not wish to return home.  In some places, excessive force has
been used by the authorities against asylum- seekers.
 
RECOMMENDED ACTION: Please send
telegrams/telexes/faxes/express/airmail letters in Bahasa Indonesia
or English or your own language: 
 
- expressing concern at the removal of 269 Vietnamese nationals from
a refugee camp to a state prison where they may at greater risk of
ill- treatment; 
 
- urging that their treatment in detention conform to international
standards, and that they be allowed access to representatives of the
UNHCR, medical personnel and their families; 
 
- urging the military to exercise restraint in their handling of the
Vietnamese nationals during the repatriation process.

	Portugal is waiting for the EU's common position on East 
Timor, which has already been approved, to be made public now that 
the hostages, being held by anti-Indonesia rebels fighting for 
independence in Irian Jaya, have been released.  

	The publication of the EU's common position was dependent upon 
the release of the British and Dutch hostages because of fears that 
announcing it might jeopardise the negotiations process.

	Given the hostages were recently released, the Secretary of 
State for European Affairs, Seixas da Costa, stated yesterday in 
Brussels :  "We are waiting for the common position to be announced 
at any moment".  It may well be finally adopted at Thursday's 
meeting of the member states' political directors.

	Although the text of the common position common position has 
not been officially made public, it is said that it expresses 
support for the East Timorese and the process of reaching a 
negotiated settlement on the territory's future.

	According to Seixas da Costa, Portugal had "shown 
understanding throughout, so as to avoid any risk of harm coming to 
the hostages.  We believe that from the moment that issue was 
resolved, conditions then became right for making public the common 
position".  The Secretary of State also said that the question had 
already been put to Portugal's Community partners.

the UN yesterday. 
 
	According to a report by the UN's Population Fund, infant 
mortality in East Timor, occupied over 20 years ago by Indonesia, is 
135 deaths per 1,000 births.  This figure is three times higher than 
in Indonesia and infinitely higher than the rate in developed 
countries, which is 3 to 7 deaths per 1,000 births.   
 
	Furthermore, in a population of less than one million, life 
expectancy for men is only 46 years and 48 years for women.   
 
	In such a context, it was, therefore, not surprising that the 
UN Population Fund was unable to obtain from the Indonesian 
authorities figures for the following: maternal mortality, primary 
and secondary school registration, and access to basic health care.

Scope : Unabridged 
Headline : SENATOR VISITS DILI 
 
Reason for Senator's mission to Indonesia and Timor is human rights. 
 
	UN Senator Clairborne Pell is meeting today with President 
Suharto in Jakarta to discuss the human rights situation in East 
Timor.  Tomorrow, he will be travelling to Dili, and plans to stay 
there a few days for meetings, including one with Monsignor Ximenes 
Belo. 
 
	According to information from Bill Bryant, the Senator's press 
adviser, Pell will also be meeting with Indonesia's Foreign 
Minister, Ali Alatas, and with members of the Indonesian National 
Commission for Human Rights. 
 
	Clairborne Pell, who leaves the Senate in November after being 
the leader of the Foreign Relations Committee for several decades, 
is representative for the State of Rhode Island, where there is a 
considerable Portuguese-American electoral component.  In a 
statement issued  before departing for his visit - the first which 
the Indonesian Government has authorised for Clairborne Pell - the 
Senator's office emphasised the concerns of Rhode Island's 
Portuguese community about conditions of life for the Timorese. 
 
	The Senator always kept up to date on human rights throughout 
the world, and wanted to be sure "to express concern about the 
situation in East Timor" on his last official visit abroad, before 
retiring from politics. 
 
Monsignor Belo expresses gratitude 
 
	The Bishop of Dili, Monsignor Ximenes Belo, thanked Governor 
of Macao Rocha Vieira yesterday for the help extended by the 
Portuguese administration to the Timorese community.  Mnsgr. Belo 
referred especially to "job and study opportunities, and to the 
protection" given to the refugees who go to Macao. 
 
	The Apostolic Administrator of Dili revealed that during his 
meeting with the Governor, the situation of the Church in East Timor 
was discussed. 
 
	Macao has been a place of refuge for many escaping from Timor, 
but most of those who have passed through the territory since 1991 
have subsequently continued their journey to Portugal or Australia, 
with help from the local government. 
 
	There are currently about 70 refugees in Macao.

Federal casino inquiry a farce: Hand

May 21 [The Age]. A former federal Labor minister yesterday hit out at the
Senate's casino inquiry, describing it as a farce and predicting that it would
find nothing adverse against the Premier, Mr Kennett, over the tendering
processes. Mr Gerry Hand strongly condemned the inquiry, and those pushing it,
saying it had its origins as a political exercise.

Mr Hand told The Age he is still furious over what he described as a malicious
campaign waged earlier this year by "people with vested commercial and
political interests" against him and his Indonesian business partner, Mr Robby
Sumampow, the principal shareholder of a Christmas Island casino resort. There
have been suggestions that the inquiry may be widened beyond the Melbourne
casino to include the granting of licenses to the Burswood, Christmas Island
and Brisbane casinos. Mr Hand's comments are bound to infuriate sections of
the federal Labor Party and especially his long-time rival, the Victorian
Senator Kim Carr, who worked with the Democrats' Senator Sid Spindler to
ensure the inquiry was set up. Mr Hand said Australia had a reputation as the
cleanest gaming country in the world, with tight scrutiny and controls.

**PEACE & DISARMAMENT CAMP**
    British Aerospace Warton, near Preston, England


The 4 women who undertook the "Seeds of Hope - East Timor" ploughshares
disarmament of an Indonesia bound Hawk back in January will be defending
themselves at Liverpool Crown Court from Monday 22nd July. 

Preceeding this trial, there will be a peace camp at BAe Warton (where the
women did the action), with activities for everybody including leafletting
workers, mass trespasses on the runway, and lots more! The peace camp will
start at 10am on Saturday 20th July, continuing through out Sunday 21st, and
will last as long as people wish it to. Hopefully, people will alternate
between taking action at Warton to stop the on-going production and testing
of Hawks for Indonesia, and popping over to Liverpool to watch the women's
trial.

Clandestine plot foiled?

Suara Pembaruan, 18 May 1996
Abridged

The military authorities in East Timor claim to have 
uncovered a clandestine plot to burn down and destroy a 
number of key installations in Dili. The military commander, 
Colonel Mahidin Simbolon announced that, following a tip-
off by local people, troops raided a house in Kuluhan, Dili.

Dduring the raid, an LE rifle and seven bullets were found, 
along with five traditional spears, dozens of arrows, a UN 
flag, four other flags, a number of documents and fifty 
molotov bombs.

The army claims that the document revealed a plan to burn 
down a number of armed forces installations, local 
government offices and the TV and radio centres. The action 
was to have been launched on 25 May.

Although no one was arrested, the authorities claim that they 
known the identity of the people involved and expect to be 
able to capture them soon.

Mr Hugh Bradley
Swedish Honorary Consul
7th Floor  NT House
Darwin   NT


Dear Mr Bradley

     The Swedish East Timor Committee has alerted AFFET to the fact that
the new Swedish government is changing its policy on arm sales to
Indonesia. The previous government had been very critical of the
occupation of East Timor and consequently banned any new arms sales
to Indonesia in 1994.

     We have been told that the Swedish government decided on the 18th of
April to issue an export permit to the arms manufacturer Bofors for 3
or 4 cannons for the Indonesian Navy.
This is a betrayal of the East Timorese,  who are still being killed by
the Indonesian military and being watched closely by the navy so that
no more people can escape by boat to Australia. Despite this the
Timorese  are still courageously refusing to accept the Indonesian
takeover of their country.

     AFFET calls on the Swedish Government to remain strong in support
of East Timor and continue with the ban on arms sales to Indonesia.
We find it disgraceful that the Swedish Government is acquiescing to
pressure from Bofors and economic greed to give more power to the
Indonesian military regime. Demonstrators in Indonesia are calling for
the military to step aside from their government involvement and for a
true democracy to be created in the country.

     We also call on the Swedish Government to support Portugal's
application to for one of the two places available on the United Nations
Security Council so that Portugal is in a strong position to work on the
issue of self-determination for East Timor. Sweden could urge countries
to give Portugal second preference after voting for Sweden's own
application.

     In Darwin we are very close to East Timor so know the situation there
thoroughly. Many of our supporters have visited the country in the last
year and we have constant contact with the East Timorese refugees
here. We hear regular reports of killings, torture and disappearances of
anyone suspected of antipathy towards the Indonesian occupiers. The
East Timorese have not accepted the takeover for 20 years and don't
look like changing their attitude. To think that the Swedish Government
which has such an impressive record on human rights is planning to
supply arms to the Indonesian navy is shameful. We urge the
government to withdraw their decision.

     If you Mr Bradley could pass this letter on to the Swedish Government
as soon as possible we would be appreciative.

     Yours sincerely

were
also seeking non-permanent council membership. The three countries would =
be
competing for two council seats which are becoming vacant soon, he
explained.

Alatas said that in return for support of Australia's bid for the =

efforts
to join the sub-commission on the Prevention of Discrimination against =

Indonesia has nominated Prof. Dr. Muladi and Prof. Dr. Charles Himawan =
for
membership in the U.N. Human Rights Commission. The two are members of
Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas-HAM).

The two foreign ministers also discussed matters affecting the =

UA: POLICE BRUTALITY AGAINST DEMONSTRATORS

A number of protesters were injured and six people were 
arrested in Jakarta when troops and police used strong-arm 
tactics against their peaceful demonstration on 4 June. The 
people had gathered for a solemn remembrance to mark the 
fortieth day of the Bloody Makassar (Ujung Pandang) 
Tragedy when troops entered the UMI university campus, 
causing three people to die as they fled the oncoming soldiers.

A few hours later five of those arrested at the Jakarta rally 
were released. The sixth, an activist named Bahar who had 
been badly beaten by police, is still in detention and is likely 
to be charged.


Demonstration, prayers and anti-military protest
About two hundred students and youth, members and 
supporters of the INDONESIAN OPPOSITION, 
(OPSI).gathered outside the University of Indonesia Faculty 
of Medicine in Jakarta at 11am and were confronted by an 
array of army troops and police. Half an hour later, a rally 
organised by PIJAR joined forces with them. The large crowd 
dispersed for prayer: Muslims went to the Arif Rahman 
Mosque on campus, and Christians went to a nearby church.

At 12.30, they re-assembled, carrying two banners reading: 
'Smash military domination' and 'Uphold the Sovereignty of 
the People'. There were also many banners condemning army 
brutality in Makassar.

The protesters then tried to march through the army barricade 
but were prevented from doing so. Lt-Col Jul Effendi, in 
command of the troops, said they would not be allowed to 
proceed. As negotiations continued, troops started trying to 
push back the protesters which resulted in scuffles. At this 
point, no one was injured.

After some time, Jul Effendi proposed that the people gather 
in groups of ten, each guarded by troops but the organisers 
rejected the idea, saying that on a previous occasion, during 
the Sri-Bintang trial, such a tactic had led to people being 
beaten by the troops.

Suddenly, Jul Effendi pushed the front row of the police 
forward, bringing them into physical contact with the 
protesters. At this point, several people were forcibly 
removed by Jul Effendi and other soldiers and taken into 
custody, for allegedly being the ones who had pushed forward 
people on their side.

At 1.30, the police officer in command came forward and 
ordered the students 'not to disrupt public order'. Half an hour 
later, OPSI organisers managed to persuade the army officers 
to let them march to the LBH office on Jalan Diponegoro. 
They marched, holding hands, singing nationalist songs and 
shouting slogans.

After arriving at the LBH office at 2.45, an open-air meeting 
was held and a number of speeches were made on the street 
outside. The traffic was held up causing congestion for about 
an hour, as hundreds of passers-by stopped to watch.

Shortly after 3pm, the protesters went into the LBH office. 
When police tried to enter as well, the protesters objected and 
there was a lot of pushing and shuvving. Some people were 
beaten. Many protesters became enraged; there were more 
scuffles and some people started throwing stones. A number 
of people fell, wounded by flying missiles. A PIJAR member 
named Bahar was dragged along, trampled on, beaten and 
pulled along the ground for a hundred metres. A journalist 
covering the event was also hurt. Two members of the police 
were injured by stones.

URGENT ACTION:

Please address protests at the army and police brutality to:

General Hartono,
Chief-of-Staff of the Army,
Fax: +62-21 364 926
Your protest to General Hartono should also express 
abhorrence at army brutality against the students in Makassar 
during their three-day protests from 22 - 24 April 1996

Major-General Dibyo Widodo,
Chief of the Indonesian Police,
Fax: +62-21 361 471

The following is a statement issued on 4 June by OPOSISI 
INDONESIA, to mark the fortieth day of the Bloody 
Makassar Tragedy:

Statement by the INDONESIAN OPPOSITION / OPSI

4 June 1996

Today, 4 June 1996, it is forty days since we all heard and 
witnessed a shameful incident that is a black stain on the 
history of the New Order, the Bloody Makassar Tragedy. This 
follows a string of tragedies: Tanjung Priok, Lampung, Haur 
Koneng, Marsinah and Nipah. The Makassar Tragedy 
happened when students who are part of the common people, 
demonstrated in protest against a decision by the Mayor of 
Makassar to raise the fares on 'pete-pete', the most popular 
means of city transport. The increase was a great burden for 
everyone. The protest demonstration started off peacefully but 
turned into an onslaught of the military against the students. 
Ironically, this happened at several university campuses in 
Makassar (Ujung Pandang).

The way the military handled the Makassar Tragedy can only 
be described as despotic and brutal. They showed total 
disregard for democratic values and human rights. In addition, 
they used 'preman' (thugs). Gangs of these mercenaries have 
been formed and given protection in order to intimidate 
anyone who comes forward with aspirations. These thugs 
have been used against workers' demonstrations in Medan, at 
the time of the disorder in the Batak church and during the 
Sri-Bintang Pamungkas trial. These examples show that the 
military always justify and make use of such brutality. 

All this makes it crystal clear that the military are involved as 
the key player in a whole range of cases and that the military 
have become an instrument of repression. They can no longer 
pose as defenders of the people, which was the purpose when 
the armed forces (ABRI) first came into being.

Are we going to allow this to continue? NO! NEVER! It is 
our joint responsibility to reform and change this intolerable 
situation and in order to do this, people's sovereignty must be 
affirmed on Indonesian soil.

We, the INDONESIAN OPPOSITION, therefore demand:

Specific demands:

1.	That the Supreme Commander of ABRI [President 
Suharto] publicly accept responsibility and apologise for the 
Makassar Tragedy through the mass media.
2.	The resignation of the ABRI chief-of-staff for 
general affairs [Lt General Soeyono].
3.	The resignation of the commander [Major-General 
Sulatin] of the Wirabuana regional military command (South 
Sulawesi).
4.	The formation of a Military Honour Council to 
conduct a thorough-going, public investigation into the 
Makassar Tragedy.
5.	All military officers involved in the Makassar 
Tragedy should be put on trial.
6.	The Makassar trials should be transparent.

General demands:

7.	The dissolution of BAKORSTANAS (the 
Coordinating Agency for National Stability) because its 
existence is not in conformity with the Constitution.
8.	The repeal of the five political laws of 1985.
9.	The separation of the Police Force from ABRI.
10.	An end to the presence of an ABRI group in 
Parliament.
11.	An end to the use of 'preman' by the military.

Indonesia threatens showdown

Financial Times, London, 3 June 1996

Manuala Saragosa in Jakarta
Unabridged


INDONESIA THREATENS SHOWDOWN ON E TIMOR

Indonesia has warned it will eventually force a showdown 
with Portugal in the UN over the controversial question of 
East Timor unless there is progress in bilateral talks on the 
political situation of Lisbon's former colony.

The blunt statement from Mr Ali Alatas, foreign minister, at 
the weekend is designed to put pressure on the new 
Portuguese foreign minister, Mr Jaime Gama.

Mr Alatas is due to meet his Portuguese counterpart for a 
second round of talks in Geneva this month. [This should be, 
second round this year]

Indonesia, whose international relations have been long 
constricted by opposition to its claim of sovereignty over 
East Timor, was frustrated by the failure of negotiations with 
the previous Portuguese government, Mr Alatas said.

It now believes that the new Socialist government is prepared 
to be more flexible and that Indonesia would win support in 
the UN for a resolution acknowledging its sovereignty over 
the territory, which it annexed in 1976.

'We're ready for a showdown any time,' Mr Alatas said in an 
interview. 'If it's in the General Assembly, we have the 
numbers and they know that. But we want a solution which is 
more or less durable and where no one feels a loser.'

Indonesian diplomats say their case would receive support in 
the UN from other developing countries, notably the 
country's allies in the non-aligned movement, which it 
chaired for three years until January, and from other 
members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations 
(ASEAN).

The mere fact that Indonesia feels able openly to consider 
such a move is an indication of the growing international 
political weight of the fast-growing south-east Asian region.

Mr Alatas said his message should not be seen as an 
ultimatum, saying: 'I don't think we should give ourselves or 
each other a deadline.' But, he pointed out that Portugal had 
refused on two occasions - in 1in 1987 and 1991 - to adopt a 
UN suggestion of an independent fact-finding mission 
followed by an open discussion and a vote among members.

The new Portuguese government had shown some signs of 
wanting to improve relations. Mr Gama had been prepared to 
discuss the question of the indirect establishment of 
diplomatic relations through special interest sections in a 
third country.

But Indonesia felt it was now up to Portugal to make 
proposals of its own, Mr Alatas said.

Indonesia's President Suharto, who is reluctant to travel in 
the west because of concern over demonstrations about East 
Timor, again firmly ruled out autonomy for the territory at a 
meeting with Australian newspaper editors last month.

Indonesia's view that most East Timorese have long accepted 
Indonesian sovereignty has still not been accepted by the 
UN.

It is challenged not only by Portugal but also by leading 
human rights organisations.

Subject: Belo on the Italian Press

From: ale@inf.fu-berlin.de (Alessandro Panconesi)



Several articles appeared recently in the Italian press.
In general, they were all very sympathetic to the cause of East Timor.
The ones I saw so far, however, do not say anything that
it is not already well-known to the reader of reg.easttimor,
for they introduced for the first time the
tragedy of the timorese to the Italian audience. 

I enclose below a translation from Italian of an article
containing a brief interview with Mons. Belo, which prompted an
official, outraged response from the Indoenesian Embassy in Rome.
The article (sympathetic but rather inaccurate and superficial, in my opinion)
appeared on Il Corriere della Sera, considered by many the
most prestigious Italian newspaper and enjoying wide circulation. 


	Cheers,

	Ale

Title: "Timor, the eternal slave"
        But Bishop Belo is sure: indoensian rule will end

Author: Ettore Mo


Dili (East Timor) -- The night of Holy Friday a procession of three, perhaps
four thousand people brought a crucified Jesus to the
Santa Cruz cemetery. Hundreds of little lights were palpitating 
in the darkness above people's heads, who intensely celebrated
the liturgy of death [Note: Easter for the Catholics] 
But here, unlike in the rest of the world, the Week of Passion wouldn't end 
at the crack of dawn because the last time the bells celebrated
the Resurrection [Note: of Jesus Christ] in East Timor it was 20 years ago. 

Its burial goes back to December 7, 1975, when indonesian troups
invaded the eastern part of Timor (a portuguese colony until a few months
earlier), stripping away the newly proclaimed independence
and handing in the island to the governement of Jakarta
which hastily annexed it on July 17, 1976, and declared
it its 27th province.
The cost of the occupation is staggering: about 200 thousand deads, about a
third of the population. A genocide.

The United Nations never recognized the legitimacy of the invasion: but who 
could care about this remote earth fragment 
(14,600 square kilometers) in the midst of an archipelago
of 18,508 islands, only 6,000 of which have a name, and 1,000 of which
have never been inhabited?
Dili, the capital, raises its voice with indignation. It protests. But for
Jakarta, which answers with 190 milion people (the
fourth most populated nation in the world), it's only the cry of a
baby. 

With the same arrogance, president Suharto did what Saddamn Hussein
did 16 years later in the Gulf. But East Timor did not have its bowels full
of oil and the US did not run to the rescue unleashing a Desert Storm.
The timorese were alone. The armed struggle, immediately undertaken
and guided by Fretilin-- the group of the Resistance best prepared for it--
was never able to contain and repel the aggression.

Today however,  if you enter Dili you won't have the
feeling of being in an occupied city. There are few soldiers in the streets,
no armoured cars in front of governement offices, and few vehicles of the
indonesian army. An almost demilitarized and sleepy capital:
fish vendors along the seaside, a few tourists with a bewildered look,
a few motionless ships in the bay, and squaling children diving 
into the water.

But behind the walls, doors and windows there are no singers of
lullabys or flutes to control Fretilin
that back in 1974 displayed the red carnations of Lisbon 
and showed off its strong marxist connotations [Note:
I doubt this make sense, but the Italian version too is obscure.]
Jakarta sent to the former colony a dozen battallions:
12 thousand men trained in rapid deployment who can count, when needed,
on the support of armoured vehicles and aircrafts.
The enemy is not scaring: a few thousands
badly equipped guerrillas scattered over the mountains; legions of
students organized in semi-clandestine brotherhoods armed only with slogans;
and the crowd, the anonymous and silent crowd of farmers
and fishermen who, all of a sudden, went from an archaic slavery to a modern
one, more rational and cruel.

Having immediately destroyed the initial aspiration of the timorese to
independence, the major aim of Jakarta was to erect
a wall of silence around the country, to isolate it from the rest of
the world so that its army could consummate its misdeeds. 
Like tha Santa Cruz massacre (November 12 1991), when the military brutally
quashed a demonstration of youngsters. It was a massacre.
To this day it is not known how many youths died: some say
100, some 200, some even 400 or 500. It seems that they were buried
in a mass grave, fattened with bullets. But where?
Nobody really knows where to lay the flowers.

People who investigate foster suspicion. The presence of foreign journalists is
discouraged in all possible ways and one has to make a big effort,
which entails having too many "suspect" stamps on the passport,
to cross the border as a tourist.
Once "on the spot" one feels scrutinized, followed from afar,
surrounded by a net of informers. The full-time spies have a fixed-salary
of 12 dollar a month: occasional bloodhounds receive one or two
dollars per information. They are fastidious, nice,
cunning: some are not insensitive to the "theft" [Note: Italian too doesn't
make sense to me].

The Via Crucis of East Timor has as many stops as those of the Calvario
and the last one does not seem too far away. Alas, anguish is now gripping
even the most irreducible amongst the independentists. Illusions and hopes are
breaking apart. The charismatic and historical leader of Fretilin 
Xanana Gusmao is in jail in Jakarta since november 1993; since then
the movement, without leadership, is struggling to survive;
the armed struggle is dissolving for lack of weapons and links; 
the great powers continue to ignore Timor which,
as the indonesian secretary of state Ali Alatas jokingly remarks with cinicism,
"is only a small stone in our shoes"; and president Suharto is about
to celebrate, on July 17, the 20th anniversary of the annexation.
All flaunted in front of the United Nations, Amnesty International and
the entire world.

"Not so fast-- says Monsignor Carlos Ximenes Belo, bishop of Dili, 
waving his arms as if to stave off an unwelcome ghost -- let's not
sing the Requiem before we see the dead. True, it seems that 
there is no alternative to the integration; independence looks
unreachable and our identity is perhaps about
to be extinguished... No, no, I feel it is not like that"

48 years old, a bona fide timorese, studies in the seminary of 
Rome, this priest of simple manners, that seems to be more confortable in a 
gown without ornaments than in episcopal garments,
became in less than 15 years the only, authentic and authoritative
spokesperson of a people that could not otherwise express its anguish
and aspirations:
"But I am not a political leader-- he cautions-- my role is only moral:
this is imposed on me by my conscienze of citizen and man of the Church.
Oh, I am well aware: we are small people which count nothing. But my
roots are in this earth and I am the shepherd of these poor people.
We have the right to say the last word: write it, journalist".
[Note: this is ambiguous in Italian. "Right" might as well
be "Responsability". The meaning then changes completely]

In 1975, when the indonesians invaded the ex-colony trucidating also 5 
reporters of an australian TV, Carlos Ximenes Belo was not yet ordained
priest. He came to know of the mass murders abroad, where he was.
"Many people were brought to the harbour and murdered one by one,
like the Nazis used to do-- recounted Xanana during a recent clandestine
interview in jail-- and the churches were destroyed and left full of urine and
excrements". All of a sudden, East Timor became yet another example
of brutal colonization. But perhaps the portuguese of the XV century,
who were the first to spread siphilis and a crass, bigoted and
luxurious form of Catholicism, were less savage.

Monsignor Belo opens his arms: "But how? I asked myself when, in 1981,
I came back to Wailacalma, my village. My mother cried, everybody cried.
Portugal had just let us free and suddenly, before we could be timorese
again, we had become indonesians-- according to a document undersigned in 1976
in Balibo which gave it a juridical foundation. But who signed it?"

Holy Thursday. A solemn religious ceremony in the cathedral of
Dili, the biggest catholic church in the whole of South East Asia.
The bishop, dressed in shining robes, cleanses the feet of the poor,
as prescribed by the liturgy. A man only skin and bones remains on his knees
in front of the altar for hours, his arms open, the hands vibrating
like leaves for the effort. The bells sound for the deads.

"The victims of the invasion were more than 200 thousand-- confirms the
bishop-- and occurred for the most part during the first phase.
A good part of the population was decimated in the years '77, '78 and '79
by bombings, illnesses and starvation. At the time the portuguese left
we were about 650 thousands, in 1979 we were reduced to 350 thousands...
today in East Timor there are 850 thousands inhabitants but one must
consider that at least 100 thousand are indonesians, sent here by 
Jakarta's policy of readjustment".

"Indonesization" of East Timor is the final objective of Suharto and
his government: once this is attained the whole island will have
a homogeneous and harmoniuos culture,
given that the western part of the island (Timor Barat) was absorbed 
by Jakarta at the moment of independence without trauma.

In 20 years of occupation, Indonesia tried to impose (often succesfully)
its own life-style which is alien to timorese costumes.
"They made me drink fresh blood coming right from the cut throat of a chicken,
as it is in their tradition" laments a fisherman of Hera with a 
grimace of disgust. As a matter of fact,  it is precisely
the attainement of this cultural metamorphosis that is behind 
the "generosity" of Jakarta which claims to have done for Tim-Tim (East Timor)
more than what Portugal had done in 3 centuries: roads, schools, hospitals.

"Prosperity and progress cannot be measured by these things--
claims Monsignor Belo-- Let's look at schools for instance. A system of
total ``indonesization'' is applied, something similar to what must have
happened in Italy during the two decades of Fascism. Boys and girls leave 
the classrooms, faculties are empty. Students do not want to swallow 
their teachings any more.. They do not realize that they are
creating an anti-indoensian youth. These are the youngsters 
which in the mountains are joining Fretilin."

From Liquica to Los palos, from Bacau to Viqueue, repression is still
very harsh: one could not otherwise explain the attempted "suicides"
of many people that to this day choose to challenge 500 kilometers of high
seas on precarious boats to reach the australian coast. To feed the
desperation of the boat people of Timor is the conviction that
"the game is over" and nobody can delude himself believeing in an
ultimate military success of the Resistance. "By now they are very few--
admits the bishop-- divided into groups of fifteen or twenty scattered
on the mountains:
but their effectivness notwithstanding, Fretilin or Falentil (its
armed branch) continue to represent the spirit of a people who does not
want to give up."

Holy friday. The bells continue to sounds for the deads. 
It would exaggerated to see in the current conflict the signs of
of a religous war: but the fervor and intensity of the Easter atmosphere
confirmed that faith and nationalist sentiments, melted together, are an
explosive mixture.
With an overwhelming islamic majority (88 % of the population),
Indonesia is the greatest muslim country in the world and it would be all
too easy for Jakarta, Belo suggest, to make a populous islamic garden out
of Timor: "But to do this-- says the bishop-- they must extirpate our
community, where the catholics
comprise the 95%. No, on this terrain we are to strong, we run no risks."

Jakarta cannot escape the conclusion that Holy Friday procession, which took
place in the cemetery of Santa Cruz, represents a double hommage: to
the nationalist students ideologically marshalled behind the Fretilin flag,
and the youths of the diocese who, together, became martyrs in the
name of Faith. It is
obvious that the indoensian government has no interest in furthering this 
kind of conflict and it is not surprising that, on July 17, president Suharto 
cunningly announced that he will take part in the inauguration of a
statue of King Christ, which will dominate from above the bay of Dili.

The bishop smiles:
"Obviously I won't be there-- he says-- I declined the invitation. I do
not like it when religion becomes an instrument. I cannot tolerate that
Jesus be inconvenienced to make solemn the anniversary
of annexation and to benedict our slavery."

A dozen people picketed and leafleted outside of the Swedish Consulate in
New York (as well as their Mission to the UN which is in the same building)
on Thursday, May 30 at lunchtime.. One of us wore a sign imitating an
Absolut Vodka ad saying: "Absolut. Terror". 

Some 600 leaflets were handed out to passers by (a number of countries also
have diplomatic offices in the same building as the Swedes, including
Australia. Canada and Ireland). The leaflet called for an end to all arms sales
to Indonesia and to the occupation of East Timor, and urged people to call
or write the Swedish consulate concerning the sale of the naval cannon and
President Clinton concerning the proposed sale of F-16 fighters.

CNN and World Television News stopped by to film, but we don't know if
anything made the airwaves.

NOTE:  For your information, the letter that Mr. Axworthy wrote in
1993, which Mr. Blaikie refers to in his question below, has been
reprinted and follows the question.
       It is most interesting to note the glaring error Mr. Axworthy
makes in his response:  the Prime Minister was not in Indonesia
last summer; he was there in January, 1996; and before that, in
November 1994 for the APEC summit.

				    May 30, 1996
			      House of Commons Debates

Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):  Mr. Speaker, my
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
       Recently I had occasion to meet with Mr. Jose Ramos-Horta who
is the spokesperson for the East Timorese.  I was made aware in the
course of the meeting of a letter sent by the Minister of Foreign
Affairs when he was on the opposition side.  He called on the
Conservative government to halt military exports and foreign aid to
Indonesia in protest of the treatment of the leader of the East
Timorese and the human rights violations in that country.
       Will the Minister of Foreign Affairs tell the House whether he
is prepared to live up to the commitments he made while he was in
opposition?  Will he declare an arms embargo and a halt to foreign
aid to Indonesia until such time as the leader of the East Timorese
is freed and human rights violations stop in that country?  Is he
prepared to work toward an international arms embargo against
Indonesia until they smarten up in East Timor?

Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):  Mr.
Speaker, let me first point out that on several occasions members
of this government have raised the issue of human rights in East
Timor.  The Prime Minister when he was there last summer took the
occasion to make the Canadian concerns well known.
       As far as arms exports are concerned, I would suggest that we
probably have the toughest arms export guidelines and controls of
any developed country.  We intend to apply them exactly as they are
meant to be applied, which is very strictly according to the letter
of the law.

....


Dear Ms. Scharfe:

       Thank you for sending me a copy of your letter to the
Secretary of State for External Affairs on the Mr. Gusmao's arrest
and the situation in East Timor.  I fully support your strong
condemnation of the Canadian government's policy towards Indonesia.
The Liberal Opposition has vigorously challenged the Secretary of
State for External Affairs on numerous occasions on this matter.

       We denounced her endorsement of the Indonesian government's
flawed investigation of the November 1991 massacre and requested an
independent international inquiry.  We opposed the dispatching of
Canadian trade officials to Jakarta only a few months after the
tragedy.  We are shocked by the increase in military exports to
Indonesia for the year 1992-93 and the continuation of $46 million
aid projects.

       As you well pointed out, these initiatives are occurring in
the context of a deteriorating human rights situation in East
Timor, where extra-judicial executions, arbitrary arrests, ill-
treatment, disappearances and politregistering Canada's protest of the
treatment of Mr. Gusmao and
halt military exports and foreign aid.  Please be assured, we will
continue to press for change and accountability in government
policy.

						   Sincerely,

						   [signed]

From: nag-gunn@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp (Geoffrey C. Gunn)


Apropos the following report, perhaps Mr. Alatas could explain how such
blusters square with the consensus statements of the Indonesian and
Portuguese foreign ministers at, inter alia, New York (17 September 1993),
on the need to foster "an atmosphere propitious to addrressing the substance
of the question", or, statement by Sec-Gen's spokesman on East Timor of 6
May 1994 "on the need for continued restraint by both parties in the
interest of maintaining a favourable atmosphere for further progress towards
a comprehensive solution of the question of East Timor" (reinterated 9
January 1995). Indeed, what is the basis of the presumption to undermine the
mandated role of the Secretary-General in overseeing this process, and, for
that matter, the presumption to dismiss East Timorese interest in their own
destiny. Nevertheless, the following revelation of Indonesian attitudes and
tactics vis-a-vis the world body must be seen as saluatory.

Geoffrey C. Gunn    



Peter Montagnon and Manuela Saragosa in Jakarta, "Indonesia threatens
showdown on E. Timor" (Financial Times, Tokyo edition, 3 June 1996), p.6
[abbrieviated]

Indonesia has warned it will eventually force a showdown with Portugal in
the United Nations over the controversial question of East Timor unless
there is progress in bilateral discussions on the political status of
Lisbon's former colony.

The blunt statement from Mr. Alatas, foreign minister, at the weekend is
designed to put pressure on the new Portuguese foregin minister, Mr. Jaime
Gama. Mr. Alatas is due to meet his Portuguese counterpart for a second
round of talks in Geneva later this month.

...."We're ready for a showdown any time", Mr. Alatas said in an interview.
"If it's in the General Assembly we have the numbers, and they know that.
But we want a solution which is more or less durable and where no one feels
a loser". [What consummate irony, in what way are the East Timorese not
losers, in this logic?, G.C.G.]

....The mere fact that Indonesia feels able openly to consider such a move is
an indication of the growing international political weignt of the fast
growing south-east Asian region. Mr. Alatas said his message should not be
seen as an ultimatum.

"I don't think we should give ourselves or each other a deadline", he said...

But he pointed out that Portugal had refused on two occasions - in 1987 and
1991 - to adopt a UN suggestion of an independent fact-finding mission
followed by an open discussion and a vote among members... [Does Alatas wish
to sanction a UN-sponsored referendum or not?, G.C.G.]  

....Indonesia's view that most East Timorese have long accepted Indonesian
sovereignty has still not been accepted by the UN.

It is challenged not only by Portugal but also by leading human rights
organisations.

From: Charles Scheiner  cscheiner@igc.apc.org 

ACTION ALERT: BAN FREE U.S. TRAINING FOR INDONESIAN MILITARY

On Wednesday, June 5, the House of Representatives debates H.R. 3540,
the Foreign Assistance Appropriations Act. If it passes unamended,
this bill will appropriate $800,000 in taxpayers' money to train
Indonesian soldiers.

ASK YOUR REPRESENTATIVE NOT TO FUND SUHARTO'S KILLERS.

Representative Barney Frank (D-Massachusetts) will introduce an
amendment to H.R.3540 to prohibit military aid for Indonesia under the
IMET (International Military Education and Training) program.

ALL Representatives will vote on this amendment today or tomorrow.

Call your Representative NOW and urge him or her to support the Frank
amendment banning IMET for Indonesia. They can be reached through the
Capitol switchboard at 202-225-3121.

Background

IMET brings foreign soldiers to the U.S. for training, and has been
provided to many countries, including Indonesia, for decades.
Thousands of the soldiers who maintain General Suharto's tight control
over the Indonesian and East Timorese people have been trained in the
USA.

Congress terminated IMET aid for Indonesia in 1992 after the Santa
Cruz massacre in East Timor, when Indonesian soldiers fired their
U.S.-supplied machine guns into a peaceful memorial procession,
killing over 250 unarmed people. The ban was reaffirmed in 1993 and
1994, although the Clinton administration circumvented Congressional
intent by selling military training to Indonesia.

After the 1994 Congressional elections, IMET for Indonesia was
partially restored, although limited to "Expanded IMET," (E-IMET)
which is ostensibly restricted to non-military subjects. The New York
Times editorialized ("No Scholarships for Indonesia's Soldiers," April
20, 1995): "By signaling to Indonesia's top commanders that American
taxpayers will pay for scholarships no matter how badly its soldiers
behave in East Timor, the Administration more than cancels out the
benefits of any new human rights training courses. Congress should
maintain the ban."

Congress did not. Led by Foreign Operations Subcommittee Chair Sonny
Callahan (R-AL), $600,000 was appropriated for E-IMET last year.
Callahan has been heavily lobbied by the Indonesian government, and
one of Suharto's top Ministers is building an aircraft factory in his
district in Mobile.

After this signal of U.S. support for the Indonesian military, the
human rights situation in East Timor deteriorated even further, with
hundreds of young East Timorese fleeing for their lives. The 1995
State Department Report on Human Rights, released last March, found
that "Reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances, and torture
of those in custody by security forces increased."

Last month, Callahan upped Indonesia's grant to $800,000 (of $45
million worldwide) for 1997. Although his bill prohibits all IMET for
Zaire and Guatemala, Indonesia would receive E-IMET.

Talking Points

1. Continuing IMET rewards Indonesia's military regime for continuing
   unacceptable policies, sending precisely the wrong message. After
   last year's restoration, the situation in East Timor has become
   more repressive than at any time since early 1992.

2. Human rights violations in East Timor are intrinsic to the military
   occupation, and represent policy determined at the highest levels.
   There have been so many violations (200,000 killings) during the
   past 21 years that it inconceivable that these are not officially
   sanctioned. No amount of "human rights" training for individual
   soldiers will change the situation.

3. "Expanded" IMET purports to train low-level soldiers in civilian
   control of the military. The Indonesian government is a military
   dictatorship which usurped control in 1965. There is no semblance
   of civilian control at any level -- even the economy is permeated
   by the military, especially in East Timor.

4. IMET is used by the Indonesian government to signify that they have
   solved the situation in East Timor. "Look," they say, "even the
   U.S. Congress finally understands that there is no problem in East
   Timor. They have given us a vote of confidence by restoring IMET."

5. The Frank amendment does not call for limitations on the U.S.-
   Indonesia economic relationship, and would have no effect on such
   ties, which benefit both the U.S. and Indonesia.

6. In this time of fiscal scarcity, here is an easy way to save
   $800,000 of taxpayers' money.

Please let ETAN know of any responses you receive. Thank you.

Subject: NZH: Dunn calls for ET war crime inquiry

The New Zealand Herald
6 June 1996
"Call for inquiry into East Timor killings"

MELBOURNE (AAP) - A former diplomat has called for an international inquiry on
Indonesian war crimes in East Timor, comparing wartime brutality there to that
in Bosnia.

Mr James Dunn, a foreign affairs correspondent and former diplomat to East
Timor, said military leaders responsible for mass killings in East Timor must
face an international tribunal such as the court of justice at The Hague.

"There have been at least three or four mass killings along the lines of some
of those perpetrated in Bosnia," Mr Dunn said in a lecture to the Australian
Institute of International Affairs.

"In Italy they are trying a man who was responsible for war crimes on a
smaller scale compared to those in East Timor.

"We badly need an ivestigation. Where are these people who did this?" he
asked.

Mr Dunn said Indonesian people wanted answers as well.

"I think it's a great thing for Indonesia to identify who were the killers
responsible - the generals or whatever - in East Timor so we can absolve the
Indonesian people of blame," Mr Dunn said.

"It often worries me when I give lectures and people stand up and say 'I never
did trust those Indonesians.' Not all Indonesians are like that. I have a
great love of Indonesians.

"The people I have a fear of are the people who have the guns."

Any talk of reconciliation was impossible for East Timor while war criminals
went unpunished, he said.

"Even if the military or the regime responsible stops killing people, the
psychological presence of the same uniform, the same arrogance, leaves it the
same.

"It doesn't matter where it is; gross violations must be brought to account if
we're going to get justice to the victims."

Indonesia has occupied the formerly Portugugese colony of East Timor since a
military invasion in 1975.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Sell Jets to Indonesia, Transfer Proceeds to Pakistan
SECTION: news
PUBLICATION DATE: 6/5/96

By Thomas W. Lippman
Washington Post Staff Writer

The Clinton administration is close to completing a three-cushion arms
export shot that would deliver F-16 combat jets to Indonesia and give
the money from the sale to Pakistan, administration officials said
yesterday.

Completion of the transaction would go a long way toward ending a
long-standing dispute between Washington and Islamabad, but it is
drawing criticism from human rights advocates, who oppose military sales
to Indonesia because of that country's occupation and repression of East
Timor.

Indonesia will buy some and perhaps all of a fleet of 28 F-16s for
which Pakistan paid $658 million in the early 1990s. The planes were
never delivered, because of a U.S. law barring military aid to Pakistan
if it were trying to build nuclear weapons.

Pakistan probably will use the proceeds from the sale to Indonesia to
buy reconditioned Mirage combat planes from France, U.S. officials and
diplomatic sources said.

The agreement is not final but "we're in very good shape on that. . .
.. Let me give you very positive body language on that," Assistant
Secretary of State Winston Lord said at a breakfast meeting with
reporters. Another official said the proposed transaction is "moving
right along" and faces no major obstacles.

Pakistan, a key Cold War ally of the United States and the base of
operations for U.S. aid to anti-Soviet rebels in Afghanistan, signed a
contract to buy the F-16s in 1989, and paid for them in installments
over the next several years. But delivery was blocked when President
George Bush notified Congress in 1990 that he was unable to certify
Pakistan had abandoned its effort to develop nuclear weapons.

That notification triggered a 1985 law -- known as the Pressler
amendment for its chief sponsor, Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) -- banning
military aid or sales to Pakistan if presidential certification was
withheld.

After meeting here last year with Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto, President Clinton said it was "not fair" to keep the money while
withholding the aircraft -- along with another $350 million in other
military equipment for which Pakistan also had paid. The administration
then negotiated with Congress in an effort to win modification of the
Pressler amendment and end the impasse.

Congress approved a plan drafted by Sen. Hank Brown (R-Colo.) to
permit release of all the military equipment except the F-16s, and
authorized the administration to find a new buyer for the planes and
reimburse Pakistan.

Implementation of that agreement was thrown into doubt earlier this
year by discovery that Pakistan had purchased from China ring magnets
apparently destined to be used in the enrichment of uranium for
Pakistan's nuclear program. But the administration notified Congress in
April that it was releasing to Pakistan all the military equipment
except the F-16s, saying that was the best way to "engage Islamabad in
our nonproliferation strategy."

Indonesia's initial purchase will be 11 planes, officials said
yesterday. Even if Indonesia eventually decides to buy all 28, a
Pakistani government spokesman said, their value has diminished since
the original purchase and there probably would still be a shortfall of
at least $150 million.

Pakistan agreed to the transaction only on the understanding that it
still wants full reimbursement and expects Washington to make up the
difference, the spokesman said.

Congress has barred export to Indonesia of small arms and riot control
equipment that could be used to put down political demonstrations, but
there is no legal barrier to an F-16 sale.

"We have not taken a position on the F-16s per se, but we have taken
the position that the United States should not be providing any arms or
[military training] to Indonesia," said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington
director of Human Rights Watch/Asia.

EXTRA 84/96  Health concern/Possible prisoner of conscience  
 
INDONESIA    Amin Baharuddin, student activist
 
Amnesty International is concerned for the health of Amin
Baharuddin, an Indonesian activist, who was badly wounded during a
demonstration in Jakarta on 4 June 1996.  He is currently being
detained at Police Resort, Central Jakarta, where he is reported to
be in need of medical attention.  Amnesty International is further
concerned that the real reason for his detention may be his peaceful
political activities, rather than the offences for which he is
charged.
 
The demonstration was held in protest at the use of excessive force
by the security forces during student riots in Ujung Pandang on the
island of Sulawasi in April 1996. It is believed that up to six
students died in the riots after clashes with the security forces
on several university campuses. The Indonesian authorities have
announced that 12 members of the security forces are facing possible
prosecution for their role in the deaths, however there is concern
that the incident has not been properly and independently
investigated (see EXTRA 57/96, ASA 21/24/96, 25 April 1996 and
follow-ups ASA 21/25/96, 1 May, and ASA 21/28/96, 13 May).
 
The Jakarta demonstration began at around 11am at the University of
Indonesia. Amin Baharuddin, an activist from a student
non-governmental organization, PIJAR, was arrested at around 3pm
after a confrontation between the police and the demonstrators at
the office of the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute. During his arrest,
Amin Baharuddin was dragged along for 100 metres by the police. He
was then repeatedly hit as he was put into a police vehicle. 
 
Amin Baharuddin did not receive medical treatment until 4am the next
morning after lawyers intervened on his behalf. He was taken to a
military hospital where he was given some medication but was not
given an intensive examination. Amnesty International is concerned
that the treatment may not have been sufficient and that Amin
Baharuddin has been returned to police custody despite the fact that
he has complained of head wounds and breathing difficulties. 
 
Earlier, during the same demonstration a confrontation between the
demonstrators and police outside the University of Indonesia
resulted in arrests and the wounding of up to five activists. Four
others were wounded during the confrontation at the LBH office. A
total of six activists, including Amin Baharuddin, were taken into
police custody. All but he have since been released. 
 
Amin Baharuddin is now facing charges under Article 212 and 213 of
Indonesia's Criminal Code, which relate to the use of violence in
resisting officials. The police are alleging that three police
officers were wounded by stone-throwing during the demonstration.
However, there is believed to be no evidence that Amin Baharuddin
was involved in violent activities. PIJAR claim that photographs and
video evidence of the demonstrations show that Amin Baharuddin was
in the back of the demonstration and was not involved in
stone-throwing.
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
 
Members of the Indonesian security forces frequently use excessive
force in dealing with both violent and peaceful protests.
Individuals engaged in protests and demonstrations have been
subjected to beatings, and in some cases shot and killed by members
of the armed forces. Those who have been detained following their
alleged involvement in protests have reported beatings and torture
in detention.
 
RECOMMENDED ACTION: Please send
telegrams/telexes/faxes/express/airmail letters in Bahasa Indonesia,
English or your own language: 
 
- urging the authorities to allow Amin Baharuddin immediate access
to medical attention;
 
- expressing concern that there at reports indicating that Amin
Baharuddin may be being detained for his non-violent exercise of his
right to freedom of expression and association, and that if this is
the case, urging that all charges against him be dropped and that
he be immediately and unconditionally released.

INDONESIA               Two men (names unknown)
 
Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of two men
arrested by the Indonesian Armed Forces during a military operation
to free 11 hostages held for three months by the Free Papua Movement
(Organisasi Papua Merdeka - OPM) in the Indonesian province of Irian
Jaya.
 
According to the military, the two men, thought to be members of the
OPM, were captured when troops from Indonesia's special forces known
as Kopassus launched a rescue operation on 15 May 1996 to free the
hostages who had been held since 8 January. The names of the two
were not given and there has been no information on their
whereabouts since their arrest. In view of serious human rights
violations in Irian Jaya including extrajudicial executions,
"disappearance" and torture Amnesty International fears that the two
may be subjected to torture during interrogation. Amnesty
International is also concerned that the two may not have had access
to independent lawyers. 
 
A human rights manual produced by the Irian Jaya regional military
command in December 1995 prohibits the use of torture to obtain
confessions or information and stresses the right of captured
members of the armed resistance to a trial in accordance with the
law. It also states that the arresting authority - in this case
Kopassus - must record the identity of the persons arrested, the
reason for the arrest and detention and that direct visit by family
members of detainees must be permitted.
 
The exact circumstances surrounding the release of the hostages
remains unclear with attempts to verify conflicting reports made
difficult by the heavy military presence in the area and
restrictions on access to independent monitors. Two Indonesian
hostages were killed during the rescue operation and, according to
the military, six to eight hostage-takers were also killed. There
are also unconfirmed reports of retaliations, including killings and
house burning, against local people by the military both before and
after the rescue. 
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
 
De facto authority over Irian Jaya was transferred from the
Netherlands to Indonesia in 1963. This was followed by a plebiscite
in 1969 to determine the territory's political status which resulted
in a vote for integration.
 
Opposition to integration with Indonesia has continued since 1963.
The OPM is among the most prominent groups advocating independence.
The OPM advocates armed struggle, but many supporters of
independence have employed peaceful means, including demonstrations,
flag-raising ceremonies, political discussion groups, and appeals
to the UN and other international bodies.
 
In recent years the issue of land and resources has generated
particular discontent, focused mainly on the PT Freeport Indonesia
Mine at Tembagapura. Since July 1994 both peaceful and violent
opposition to the mine from local people has intensified. In April
1995, allegations of serious human rights violations in response to
these protests began to emerge. The allegations which included
extrajudicial executions, "disappearances", torture and arbitrary
arrests, were later investigated and confirmed by Indonesia's
National Commission on Human Rights, Komisi Nasional Hak Asasi
Manusia (Komnas Ham).
 
RECOMMENDED ACTION: Please send
telegrams/telexes/faxes/express/airmail letters in Bahasa Indonesia,
English or your own language: 
 
- urging the authorities to provide details of the names and
whereabouts of the two people arrested during the operation on 15
May 1996 to release the hostages in Irian Jaya; 
 
- seeking assurances that the detainees are not being subjected to
any form of torture or ill-treatment; 
 
- calling for the detainees to be granted access to lawyers of their
own choice, members of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
family members and adequate medical care; 
 
- referring to the obligations on the detaining authority under the
December 1995 human rights manual produced by the Irian Jaya
regional military command.

Xanana to study law 

AFP, Lisbon, 5 June 1996

East Timor independence leader, Xanana Gusmao, now 
serving a 20-year jail sentence in Indonesia, has signed up as 
a law student at the university of Coimbra in central Portugal. 
Jose Ramos-Horta, Gusmao's representative abroad,, said 
Xanana wanted to take advantage of his imprisonment to 
improve his higher education.

Ramos-Horta said Indonesian, Australian and US universities 
were prepared to accept Gusmao on correpondence courses. 

'We chose Coimbra because of its historical prestige and 
symbolic importance,' he added. 'We hope that Indonesia, in 
its own interest does not create unnecessary obstacles.'

The university rector, Rui de Alarcao, pledged to resolve any 
problems posed by the Indonesian authorities.

Ireland's pledge on East Timor

Irish Times, 7 June 1996
David Shanks

Ireland promises to help fund UN talks on East Timor 
problem

[Intro] David Shanks reports on yesterday's meeting between 
exiled Timorese resistance leader, Jose Ramos-Horta, and the 
Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Ms 
Joan Burton


Ireland has offered to look 'very, very sympathetically' at any 
application for funds to facilitate the UN-sponsored series of 
talks aimed at finding a solution to the East Timor problem.

The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, 
Ms Joan Burton, pledged this when she met Mr Jose Ramos-
Horta, the leader in exile of the Timorese resistance to 
Indonesian rule in the former Portuguese colony.

Mr Horta was in Dublin to brief the Government on the 
immediate demands of the National Council for Maubere 
Resistance (CNRM) in anticipation of Ireland's presidency of 
the EU which 'has so far only given lip service to the cause of 
East Timor,' said Mr Horta.

Mr Horta said 'Ireland's moral capital 'was second to no other 
European Union member. Ireland has never invaded anyone, 
and has no imperial past, 'so no Asian country can lash back 
at Ireland'. The EU could take the initative in forging an 
international consensus to press for construction of proposals 
at the UN, which still recognises Portugal as the 
administrative power.

Up to now, in the UN sponsored 'Inter-Timorese Dialogue', it 
had been up to the Portugal or the Timorese. 'Indonesia has 
only been there to say no, no, no.'

Mr Horta who before Indonesia's invasion was briefly foreign 
minister of East Timor's provisional government, criticised a 
recent chairman's statement of the UN Commission on 
Human Rights as 'a disgrace' and 'grotesque'. It had, he said, 
fallen well short of condemning gross human rights 
violations. He wants to see EU pressure on the UN to set up a 
human rights monitoring office in East Timor. 'The EU has 
put no pressure on the UN for this.'

The civil and armed resistance, under very strong military 
pressure in the past two years, was not calling for trade 
sanctions against Indonesia. 'It would be a no-win situation 
for us.' But he said the EU could use trade pressure. He saw 
no contradiction between trade and a strong human rights 
policy.

Pressure on human rights by trading partners would help 
provide security for investors. Low wages and lack of labour 
rights in Indonesia, which has a reputation as the world's most 
corrupt country, were undercutting western prices. This in 
turn affected European and US labour rights. The 
'extraordinary' level of imports of Nike, Reebok and other 
goods  made by very low-paid workers was an example.

Ms Burton told Mr Horta that human rights had to be 
included in the dialogue with Indonesia. The Tanaiste, Mr 
Dick Spring, may be visiting Indonesia during the presidency, 
she said. (Ireland has a growing trade with Indonesia.)

Hoping that at the forthcoming UN General Assembly, the 
EU would make a more forceful statement on East Timor than 
before, Mr Horta said CNRM was pressing for an assembly 
debate in 1997 and 'confrontation'. 'We can win a debate in 
the UN.'

He predicted that following parliamentary elections next year, 
the government of President Suharto, in power for three 
decades, 'will be discredited and there may be fighting in the 
streets' in Indonesia. 'This has already started,' he said.

As a stabilising prelude to a referendum strictly for Timorese, 
Mr Horta demanded 'a drastic reduction in Indonesian 
military strength' which he put at up to 30,000 troops.

Mr Horta said he was organising an international East Timor 
solidarity television concert featuring the best of Portuguese 
artists. He hoped Bono, the U2 lead singer - a 'most caring 
person' - would give 'three hours of his time' to this 
extravaganza.

       East Timor Action Network Urges Congress 
       to End Military Training Aid to Indonesia

The East Timor Action Network (ETAN) today urged the House of
Representatives to support an amendment to delete funding for IMET
military training aid to Indonesia. The House is scheduled to vote
on the amendment, introduced by Barney Frank (D-MA) on Tuesday,
June 11, when it resumes consideration of HR 3540, the Foreign
Assistance Appropriations Act. 

According to ETAN National Coordinator Charlie Scheiner, "ETAN
believes that providing IMET only rewards Indonesia's military
regime for continuing its destructive policies in East Timor."

Last year, Congress voted to restore IMET (International Military
Education and Training). It had cut it off in 1992 in response to
the massacre of over 250 peaceful protesters in Dili, East Timor,
on November 12, 1991. Although Congress passed a restricted form of
IMET (known as Expanded IMET), Indonesia saw it as a signal of
lessened Congressional concern about abuses in East Timor. 

Since then, the human rights situation in East Timor has
deteriorated with hundreds of young East Timorese attempting to
flee East Timor and Indonesia by entering embassies in Jakarta. The
1995 State Department Report on Human Rights, released in March,
found that "Reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances, and
torture of those in custody by security forces increased." 

Expanded IMET (E-IMET) is confined to non-weapons training in areas
like human rights and civilian control of the military.

"The problem with the Indonesian military is not a lack of awareness
of human rights, but there deliberate violation on orders from
above," said Scheiner. "There have been so many deaths and other
human rights violations during the past 21 years that it is
inconceivable that these are not officially sanctioned. No amount
of 'human rights' training for individual  soldiers will change the
situation. 

"While E-IMET purports to soldiers in civilian  control
of the military," added Scheiner, "the Indonesian government is a
military dictatorship." 

If passed unamended, HR 3540 will appropriate $800,000 for
International Military Education and Training (IMET) for Indonesia.
This is $200,000 more than this year's appropriation.

Indonesia invaded East Timor over twenty years ago on December 7,
1975. It annexed East Timor the following July in a move not
recognized by the United Nations. According to human rights groups
and the Catholic Church over 200,000 people, one-third of the
population, have been  killed by fighting, executions, and famine
and disease. 

The East Timor Action Network/US was founded following the November
1991 massacre. ETAN/US supports genuine self-determination and human
rights for the people of East Timor in accordance with the UN
Charter and pertinent General Assembly and Security Council
resolutions. ETAN/US currently  have a dozen local chapters around
the country.

BALTIC SEA REGION NEWS

RIGA-VILNIUS -- NEGOTIATIONS  OVER  THE  LATVIA-LITHUANIA  SEA
BORDER DISPUTE SHOW PROGRESS,  according to the State Minister
of Foreign Affairs,  Juris Sinka,  who is leading the  Latvian
delegation at the sea border talks with Lithuania, in Vilnius,
Lithuania.  Mr.  Sinka said on April 23 that he  is  satisfied
with  the  talks  and  considers that another step froward has
been taken.  Delegations from Lithuania and Latvia  had  taken
the  1927 Latvia-Lithuania agreement as the starting point for
negotiations.  Latvia had agreed that part of  the  Lithuanian
coast  line  includes the Kursu Joma (Kursu Strait) from which
the Latvia-Lithuania sea border extends into the  Baltic  Sea.
The talks were devoted entirely to the border issue.  The next
round of negotiations will take place in Riga on May  7,  when
Lithuania's President Algirdas Brazauskas visits Latvia.  Both
sides have expressed their desire to settle the dispute  in  a
timely fashion. (LETA)

TARTU-PSKOV -- ESTONIAN MINISTRIES OF FINANCE AND OF TRANSPORT
AND  COMMUNICATIONS  have  publicly  disagreed  on  a  highway
project to connect Tallinn,  through Tartu and Voru,  with the
existing St.  Petersburg-Kiev Highway.  Ministry of  Transport
representative  Lembit  Kiviloo  stated  that  the  project is
without perspective for Estonia. The Via Russica project would
include  upgrading  the  existing  Tallinn-Tartu  road  into a
highway, connecting Tartu with Voru via Petseri (Pechora), and
renovating  the  railway  link  from  Valga to Pihkva (Pskov).
Southeastern Estonia would in this way become a transit  point
from   Russia   to  Scandinavia.  The  Ministry  of  Transport
representative  believes  that  the  development  of  railways
should  be the sole main priority,  as today only five percent
of cargo traffic goes by highway. (ETA, 26 Apr.)

April 26, VILNIUS -- LITHUANIA'S IGNALINA NUCLEAR POWER PLANT,
the  home  of  two  Chernobyl-type  reactors,  remains a major
source of concern to  the  Baltic  state's  Nordic  neighbors,
stated  one  Scandinavian  diplomat  in  Vilnius.  "There is a
general level of concern in the  Nordic  countries  about  the
possibility  of  an  accident at Ignalina," he said.  Ignalina
supplies about 80 percent of Lithuania's  electricity,  making
Lithuania  the  most  nuclear-power  dependent  country in the
world. Four reactors were originally planned for Ignalina, but
construction on the third was halted in 1987 by massive public
protests in the wake of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

RIGA -- POLICE  IN  LITHUANIA  HAVE  SEIZED  10  KILOGRAMS  OF
CAESIUM133  and  arrested  two men who were trying to sell it,
the country's prosecutor's office said.  Lithuania and  Baltic
neighbors  Latvia  and  Estonia  are  suspected  of  being key
gateways for the smuggling to the West of radioactive and rare
metals  pilfered  from the former Soviet bloc.  Caesium can be
produced as a deadly by-product of  nuclear  fission  but  the
prosecutor's  office  said  the  caesium-133  variety  is  not
radioactive.  It is, however, very poisonous. The two men were
arrested  in  Kaunas  after  they  tried to sell the metal,  a
prosecution statement said.


SVETOGORSK, KARELIA  --  THE GIANT SVETOGORSK PAPER PROCESSING
PLANT is being converted by its new Swedish owners to  operate
on  natural  gas  rather than oil.  The gas energy source will
produce less air pollution and  is  more  economical  for  the
plant than oil today,  due to the high transportation costs of
oil within Russia.  The plant produces much of  the  cardboard
used  in  Tetra  packaging  throughout  Russia  and the C.I.S.
Improvements are also planned at the plant in future in  order
to  make the present bleaching process of cardboard stock more
environmentally safe. (Vesti)


RIGA --   LATVIA   SPENT   SIGNIFICANTLY  LESS  LAST  YEAR  ON
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION than in the previous year,  according
to the Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia.  About 36 million
U.S.  dollars were spent on environmental protection  and  the
rational  utilization  of natural resources in Latvia in 1995,
which represents a decrease of 45 percent in  comparison  with
1994, according to the Statistical Bureau. (LETA)


ST PETERSBURG -- ESTONIAN DEFENSE MINISTER ANDRUS  OOVEL  TOOK
PART  in  the international conference "Security in the Baltic
Sea Region" 27-28,  according to the Defense Ministry's  press
service.  Mr.  Oovel  made  a  report  at the first day of the
conference,  which was chaired by Danish Defense Minister Hans
Haekkerup.  Mr. Oovel devoted his attention to Russia's aim of
changing the Baltic Sea's legal status to a mare clausum.  The
conference  was  attended  by  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Sergei Krylov,  Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen,  Mayor
of St.  Petersburg Anatoly Sobchak, and Norwegian Secretary of
State Siri Bjerke. (ETA).

BALTIC SEA  REGION  --  More  cargo passed through the Latvian
port of Ventspils in 1995 than through any other port  of  the
Baltic Sea. Cargo Handled (in millions of tons in 1995):
Ventspils 29.6,  Kotka 8.4,  Gdansk 18,  Gdynia 7.6,  Szczecin
15.5, Riga 7.4,  Tallinn 13,  Hamina 5.3, Klaipeda 12.7, Turku

BALTIC SEA STATES WRAP UP SUMMIT ON COOPERATION

VISBY/SWEDEN
Government leaders  of  the  11  Baltic  Sea nations concluded
their first ever summit here today with a declaration  calling
for stability, prosperity and solidarity in the region.

In the  declaration,  member  countries  of the Council of the
Baltic Sea States (CBSS) agreed on a range of  initiatives  to
bring about cooperation and integration in the region.

The countries  are  facing  a  unique  opportunity to make the
Baltic Sea region prosperous, stable and safe, it said.

Government leaders called on business  and  industry  to  help
bring   about  an  economic  boom  in  the  region  and  urged
international financial institutions to step up  participation
in funding infrastructure and economic development.

They agreed  to reinforce cooperation between police,  border,
customs,  immigration and coast guard  authorities  to  ensure
citizens' security and combat organized crime.

The leaders  also  agreed  to  intensify cooperation on energy
supply,  nuclear  safety,  nuclear  waste  disposal  and   the
environment. The Baltic Sea is one of the most polluted in the
world.

The summit  also  added  its  support  for  Estonia,   Latvia,
Lithuania and Poland's membership of the European Union (EU).

A wide  range  of issues from the environment to democracy and
international cooperation  were  covered  during  the  two-day

GERMANS OFFICIALS BRACE FOR VIOLENCE OVER NUCLEAR SHIPMENT

* EDITORIAL: we disagree with Reuters, but that's whats  offi-
cials says. Useful to know. Some of people prepared this issue
are supporting german anti-nuke protests completely.

BONN, Reuters

German officials on Monday appealed for calm  but  braced  for
more  violence from anti-nuclear activists ahead of a shipment
of nuclear waste due to arrive by rail from France this week.

The train,  the first of some 110  due  to  carry  radioactive
waste  from  a  French reprocessing plant back to Germany over
the next eight years,  is  expected  to  reach  a  medium-term
storage unit in northern Germany on Wednesday.

Its impending  arrival  has  galvanised  opponents  of nuclear
energy who have sabotaged rail lines and clashed with police.

"I ask all citizens  to  distance  themselves...from  criminal
activity  and  to  show  understanding  for  the police," said
Ulrike Wolff-Gebhardt,  who heads the local government in  the
northern town of Lueneburg, near the Gorleben storage depot.

A Greenpeace spokeswoman in Germany said French officials were
apparently about to load the train with special containers for
the 1,500-km (900-mile) trip from the reprocessing plant in La
Hague to the storage site in Gorleben.

The environmentalist group was expecting the load to arrive in
Lower  Saxony  state  where  the  site  is  located  early  on
Wednesday, she added.

There was no official confirmation of  this,  but  the  German
government has said the shipment will arrive within days.

An administrative  court  in Lueneburg reinstated an immediate
ban on protests around the Gorleben depot that a  lower  court
had curbed as too restrictive last week.

Around 3,000  police  officers  and border guards clashed with
hundreds of protesters near Gorleben overnight.

Lueneburg police said they detained 89 people after about  300
militants,  some of them masked, attacked officers with stones
and flares near the depot,  120 km (75 miles) east of Hanover.
They may be charged with breach of the peace.

Two policemen  were  slightly injured and four police vehicles
were damaged.

In the eastern state of Brandenburg,  two  locomotives  pulled
down  overhead  power cables along a two-km (one-mile) stretch
when  they  ploughed  into  grappling  hooks  and  lines  that
activists had draped over the wires, police said.

Anti-nuclear leaflets were found scattered nearby.

The incidents  were the latest in a series of protests against
the shipment.  Anti-nuclear activists have  sabotaged  railway
lines  by sawing through rails,  setting fire to signal boxes,
toppling a power line and making bomb threats.

Thousands of protesters demonstrated peacefully near the depot
on  Saturday  but  police  stepped  up security after speakers
called for campaigners to use  "all  means"  to  hold  up  the
container carrying the waste.

Hans-Ruediger Hesse, spokesman for the anti-extremist watchdog
agency in Lower Saxony state,  told German radio that militant
leftists,  in  search of a theme to win more supporters,  were
exploiting the anti-nuclear protests.

"Militant leftist extremists in Germany have taken on the  job
of preventing the castor transport," he said, referring to the
containers that hold the nuclear waste.

He said extremists had not only called for sabotage  but  also
provided  instructions  on how to build and lay bombs to wreck
the rails.

"This makes the scene extremely dangerous," he said.

Last year  14,000  police  were  deployed  when  thousands  of
anti-nuclear  demonstrators  and  residents held mass protests
when the first consignment of nuclear waste was  delivered  to
the Gorleben depot in April from a German reactor. (May 6)

Subject: BOSNIA: AIHA Seeks US Partners
Date: 14 May 1996 09:42:42 -0800 (PST)

From: Mark Storey  mstorey@igc.apc.org 



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 13, 1996

    Health Care Alliance/USAID Seek US Health Care Institutions for
               Partnership Project in Bosnia-Herzegovina

WASHINGTON, DC  --  The American International Health Alliance,
Inc. (AIHA) and the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) announce the planned expansion of their health
care partnership program with a new partnership in Tuzla, Bosnia-
Herzegovina.  AIHA is soliciting expressions of interest from
qualified US hospitals and health care institutions willing to
devote substantial in-kind resources, mainly in the form of human
resources committed on a volunteer basis, to a two-year partnership
with counterparts in Bosnia.

The new health care partnership will be part of an ongoing health
care development program financed through USAID and managed by AIHA
which includes forty partnerships in nine countries of Central and
Eastern Europe (CEE) and ten republics of the former Soviet Union. 
AIHA partnerships have enabled American health care providers to
work with their colleagues abroad to address significant mortality
and morbidity issues, improve health care organizations and
introduce market-oriented solutions to health system delivery
problems.  The emphasis of the program is on professional exchanges
involving physicians, nurses, administrators and technicians.  AIHA
partnerships also collaborate with related ministries of health,
local and regional health systems administrations, and schools of
health sciences to ensure that critical areas of health education
and administration are adequately addressed at these higher
institutional levels, and that the capacity to carry out other
developmental assistance efforts is enhanced.

The new partnership in Bosnia is intended to further USAID~s
objective of promoting ethnic reconciliation and strengthening the
on-going peace process.  USAID and AIHA believe that the
partnership will reinforce the credibility of the new Muslim-Croat
Federation -- a cornerstone of the Dayton agreement -- by providing
tangible evidence that the Federation can serve local needs. 

The Bosnia partnership will share certain goals with existing CEE
partnerships, namely improving medical and technological knowledge,
expanding the role of nursing, and enhancing institutional
management and financing skills to develop in the Bosnian
institution a capacity to sustain itself financially.  Moreover,
the partnership will develop community-based programs impacting the
populations served by the Bosnian partner institutions by, for
example, improving the delivery of primary care and strengthening
linkages between hospital and primary care practitioners.

According to USAID, the success of the Federation ultimately will
depend on ~the political will of local communities of Croats and
Bosniacs to devise the institutional means to begin
their own recovery.~  At a later stage of the partnership, AIHA
anticipates that the community-based programs will develop an
active multi-sector community participation that would encourage
local leaders to work together to determine local priorities and
implement community-based intervention strategies.

AIHA and USAID expect that the CEE partner will be located in
Tuzla, a city in north-eastern Bosnia where the U.S. military
presence is centered.  The hospital component of the partnership
may target critical medical/surgical procedures, emergency
medicine, or rehabilitation at Tuzla~s teaching hospital in
addition to management training and development.  The focus of the
partnership~s community outreach component will depend upon the
priorities of the Bosnian partners. 

AIHA/USAID is not the principal funding source for partnership
activities, but rather supplements the voluntary and in-kind
contributions of the partners and their respective communities in
the US and abroad.  Existing AIHA partnerships have leveraged
nearly three dollars of voluntary support for every US government
dollar expended.  AIHA/USAID funds will mainly support travel and
other costs essential in establishing and realizing the full
potential of a partnership program, including communication and
interaction with other partnerships.  AIHA staff in Washington, DC
and in Europe will provide logistical support and assist in
monitoring the progress of the partnership.  

Interested US partners must have the willingness and capacity to
meet the specific health care delivery needs described above, and
must satisfy the following criteria:

*     Be institution-based -- e.g., a hospital or group of
      hospitals; health care planning consortium sponsoring a
      healthy communities project; other institutions engaged in the
      implementation and/or the evaluation of a healthy communities
      project.  If a group of institutions is involved, a lead
      institution must be designated;

*     Be supported by the institution~s senior leadership and Board
      and clearly identify an overall partnership coordinator;

*     Make a substantial voluntary commitment to the partnership
      through a significant contribution of resources, including
      human resources;

*     Actively involve the local community served by the US
      partners, including any significant emigre community that may
      be present;

*     Share information openly and participate fully in AIHA~s
      efforts to exchange information with other US/CEE and US/NIS
      partnerships through the AIHA Partnership Clearinghouse and
      dissemination conferences and seminars;

*     Adhere to AIHA~s rigorous objective-setting and results-
      oriented approach, including:

      (a)  Enter into a formal Memorandum of Understanding
           (MOU) and work within the overall coordination and
           guidance of AIHA and its designated program
           coordinator;

      (b)  Develop demonstration-type interventions with
           significant training components and capacity for
           replication;

      (c)  Establish mechanisms (such as training programs and
           conferences) for the diffusion of partnership
           successes; and

      (d)  Participate in regular program evaluations to
           assess partnership progress and achievements.

Hospitals or health care institutions wishing to be considered for
participation in the new Bosnia partnership should send a short
statement (10 pages maximum) by JUNE 15, 1996 detailing their
interest and ability to enter into a collaborative relationship
with a Bosnian partner under the AIHA model.  The statement should
describe the institution~s commitment to the partnership program,
the human and material resources it will devote to a partnership,
and specific strengths of the institution that enhance its ability
to address the needs of the Bosnian partner.  Working with USAID
and an outside advisory panel, AIHA will select the institution or
group of institutions which best match the needs of the Bosnian
partner, best fulfill the criteria listed above, and offer the
greatest potential for sustaining a partnership beyond the
availability of AIHA funding.

Statements should be directed to :

      Program Director, Central & Eastern Europe
      American International Health Alliance, Inc.

RUSSIA-BALTICS-POLAND -- THE HIGHWAY PROJECT  "VIA  HANSEATIC"
between  St.  Petersburg and Gdansk,  which would link several
former Hanseatic cities,  is to be supported by funds from the
European  Union.  More than 900 million ECU are expected to be
invested in project before 1999. This project would complement
"Via Baltica", which is to lead between Helsinki, Tallinn, and
Warsaw. (Vecher. Peterburg)

TALLINN - CORRUPTION CHARGES AGAINST THE ESTONIAN MINISTER  OF
ENVIRONMENT  VILLU  REILJAN  have  been dropped after a failed
vote of no-confidence by the Estonian Riigikogu on May 13. The
charges  came  as a result of the state Audit Office's release
of information that Mr. Reiljan conducted a business deal with
a  company  in  which  he  owned stock while he was working as
director  of  Luua  Higher  Forestry  School.  Besides   being
illegal,  the  deal  also concerned live trees sold as timber.
The KMU faction described the vote as political  and  declared
its  intent  to oppose it.  The Reform Party faction supported
the vote,  explaining is as a matter of conscience rather then
a political issue. (Postimees)

LENINGRAD OBLAST  --  A  NEW  LEGISLATIVE  BILL "ON THE USE OF
FOREST IN LENINGRAD OBLAST" represents  a  serious  threat  to
forest  in the region,  argued members of Greenpeace and local
non-government  environmental   organizations   at   a   press
conference  in  St.  Petersburg.  Acceptance of the bill would
result in the liquidation of control over the territory by the
Federal  Agency  of Timber and therefore the introduction of a
monopolistic right of commercial access to that timber by  the
oblast administration. (Nevskoe Vremiia, 14 May)

ST. PETERSBURG  --  FINES  FOR  POLLUTION  IN  THE  CITY  HAVE
RECENTLY BEEN INCREASED BY 10O PERCENT.  The increase  is  the
result   of  the  necessity  to  increase  revenues  for  city
construction projects to protect the environment, according to
the  Direction of Environmental Protection in St.  Petersburg.
The increase in fines are aimed  at  those  enterprises  which
pollute the atmosphere and groundwater. (Delovoi Peterburg, 14
May)

SOSNOVY BOR,  RUSSIA -- A  RESTRICTED  SAFETY  ZONE  has  been
established  at  the  distance of one kilometer in the Gulf of
Finland from the water outlet from the  nuclear  power  plant.
Boats, including pleasure and fishing, will now be banned from
entry into this restricted area.  Fishermen in  the  area  are
reported  to have made particularly large catches in this area
in the past due to the warm water discharged  from  the  plant
into the Gulf in this location. (SPb Vedomosti, May)

DAUGVPILS, LATVIA  --  CONSTRUCTION  OF  A  NEW HYDRO ELECTRIC
POWER PLANT on the Daugava River in the vicinity of Daugavpils
is   under   consideration.   Scientists   from   the  Latvian
Environmental Protection center,  members of the  organization
Daugavas  Loki,  and  local  farmers  are  all  opposed to the
project.  They argue that environmental damage will exceed any
economic  advantage  gained  from  the new power plant.  Local
government  and  business  interests  are  in  favor  of   the
construction  to provide relatively inexpensive electric power
and to create new job opportunities in the region.  (LETA,  14
May)

STOCKHOLM --  The  first  BALLERINA (BALtic Sea Region On-line
Environmental  Information  Resources  for  INternet   Access)
workshop  will be held 13-14 June.  The aim of the workshop is
to discuss and provide guidelines on how to make the BALLERINA
initiative  the  gateway  for environmental information on the
Baltic Sea region on the Internet. BALLERINA will be developed
as a cooperative effort among agencies and organizations which
produce and disseminate environmental  information  about  the
Baltic  Sea  and its drainage area.  Contact Sindre Langaas at

PARNU, ESTONIA - A MEETING OF ESTONIAN, LATVIAN AND LITHUANIAN
PRIME MINISTERS is to take place in Parnu on May 22.  The main
issues to be tackled are free trade agreements in  the  Baltic
area and Via Baltica highway project. The prime ministers have
agreed that the free trade agreement  should  be  extended  to
agricultural produce. (ETA, May 13)

ANTINUCLEAR CAMPAIGN PUBLISHES THE MOST SUCCESSFULL AND UNIQUE
BOOK OF PRESENT DAYS ABOUT "MAYAK" NUCLEAR FACILITY

MOSCOW,- There  is  just  published  the  most informative and
unique book about  "Mayak"  nuclear  facility  is  located  in
Chelyabinsk. "Mayak"  was  working  for  a years to produce as
plutonium as the nuclear fuel for USSR defensive complex.  The
book is  published by the anti-nuclear campaign in ex-USSR (PO
Box 211,  121019 Moscow,  Russia,  tel/fax  298-3087,  e-mail:
ed@cci.glasnet.ru). The  author  of the book is a Moscow based
scientist and journalist Vladislav Larin.

The book of Vladislav Larin is devoted to the first enterprise
of  military  nuclear-industrial  complex,  where nuclear bomb
plutonium production took place.  The author had made  it  his
aim  to  collect together all accessible information about the
Mayak enterprise: about its history, technological scheme, the
essence and the consequences of the accidents which took place
at  the  combine,  about the levels of radiation contamination
and the  consequences of the accidents for people health - for
both he personnel of the combine and the  inhabitants  of  the
region...  This  book  can  fully serve as a reference book on
this problem for today.  (L.Popova - director of the Centre of
nuclear  ecology and energy policy of the Social-Environmental
Union).

....the books like this one are important - they don't allow to
forget  about the bygone mistakes.  The tragedy of the "Mayak"
is our common misfortune and we will be able  to  improve  the
situation  only  in  case if we profoundly realize the sources
and the  details of this problem.  (A.Yablokov - corresponding
member of the Academy of Sciences of Russia,  chairman of  the
Joint Commission  on Ecological Safety of the Security Council
of Russia.)

The book is written on the basis of a large number of recently
declassified literary sources and personal impressions of  the
author from visiting the "Mayak" enterprise. The volume of the
book is 175 pages,  it consists of the spacious  introduction,
five  chapters,  supplements and the list of literature of 109
titles.  The introduction is devoted  to  examination  of  the

RUSSIAN CITIZENS   ARE  FIGHTING  A  US  CO-FOUNDED  PLANT  TO
REPROCESS LIQUID ROCKET FUEL

Citizens of  the  Russian  town of Sergei Posad are fighting a
government plan to build a U.S.  co-funded plant in their town
to  reprocess  thousands  of  tons  of heptyl,  a highly toxic
chemical used as liquid rocket fuel.
There are unwanted stocks  of  heptyl  (dimethylhydrazine)  at
various  military  installations  around Russia where missiles
and rockets are made and launched.  Russia  continued  to  use
liquid  rocket fuel long after America switched to solid fuel,
largely because it was cheaper.
   However, heptyl   is  highly  toxic,  carcinogenic,  easily
soluble in water (which means in the event of a  leak  it  can
spread quickly and easily) and, of course, very volatile.
   Estimates of how much heptyl is stored in  Russia's  former
"closed  cities,"  the  Soviet-era  secret  towns  like Sergei
Posad, in Soviet days known as Zagorsk, range from 50,000 tons
to 150,000 tons.
   At the  Scientific  Research  Institute  of  Chemical   and
Construction  Machines  (SRICCM) based in Sergei Posad,  there
are over 100 tons  of  heptyl  in  storage.  And  if  the  new
reprocessing  facility  is installed,  at least another 10,000
tons will be brought there from the other sites in Russia.
   Hundreds of  signatures  have  been  collected on petitions
protesting about the plans.
   "The people of this town object to these plans, and rightly
<a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a>," says the mayor of Sergei Posad,  Vasili Goncharov, who is
leading  the  protests.  "We  already  have enough problems to
contend with in this area,  including a radon depository and a
testing site for storage of pesticides and household waste."

Heptyl disposal is not just a Russian problem. Other countries
with missile and space  programmes  also  have  problems  with
ageing  stocks  of  heptyl  since  <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a>  far  no  technology for
reprocessing has proved to be  environmentally  friendly.  The
facility to be built in Sergei Posad,  some 70 kilometers from
Moscow,  will  be  constructed  with  U.S.   aid   under   the
Congress-backed Nunn-Lugar technical assistance program.  This
has raised fears that foreign heptyl will also be  brought  in
for treatment.
   "The reprocessing project is tied to deliveries  of  heptyl
from  abroad,  especially  from  the  United  States," alleges
Goncharov.  "This  is  part  of  a  wider  policy  of  dumping
dangerous  and  harmful  production  processes  on  us here in
Russia."
   Henryk Matysyak,  Director  of  SRICCM,  absolutely  denies
this. "Only Russian heptyl will be processed in Sergei Posad,"
he  insists.  He  points  out  that  there  are plans to build
similar facilities in two other Russian towns where heptyl  is
stored.
   "This is part of a five-year project and a special place in
the  plans is given to ecological safety," he says.  He points
out that his institute has been working with heptyl  for  many
years and is well aware of all the precautions that need to be
taken.
   "We have  been  dealing  with  this chemical since the days
when it was carried about in buckets," he says. He is proud of
the reservoir that the Institute has built for the town, which
contains water that is originally contaminated by heptyl.
   "All the   water   is  filtered  through  our  purification
installations and is <a name=L10003></a><a href=#L10004>so</a> clean that our children can  bathe  in
it. My grandchildren and I myself swim in it and crayfish live
there."
   Matysyak is  certain that the town's people will eventually
accept the facility.  He cited earlier  protests  against  the
dismantling of naval missiles, which rapidly abated.
   "Given the high level of unemployment today  and  the  fact
that the reprocessing project will create good jobs,  I do not
expect  the  opposition  to  last  long,"  he  explains.  "The
facility  will  give  workers the opportunity of earning up to
500,000 rubles  ($100)  a  month  with  no  payment  arrears."
Average    wages   paid   by   cash-strapped   employers   are
significantly lower than this in Russia.
   There has  been no protest at all from Institute employees,
said Matysyak.  "Workers here are not concerned.  They have  a
sensible view of the project and understand the realities."
   Viewed in  the  wider  context,  however,  the  project  is
causing  concern to environmentalists who fear that Russia may
rapidly be becoming the world's toxic waste dump.
   Last year the environmental commission of Russia's Security
Council found that over 2,000 tons of  dangerous  wastes  from
abroad were being brought into the country every day.  In many
cases  the  imports  were  carried  out  on  the  pretext   of
recycling, the commission warned.
   As to the reprocessed heptyl,  there are plans to use it in
the manufacture of dyes.

PRESS-RELEASE

"ECODEFENSE!: DIRECT  ACTIONS  AND ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION FOR
CHILDREN ARE ONLY WAYS TO PROTECT OUR MOTHER-EARTH"

Koenigsberg/Kaliningrad, May 26

The new   video  at  The  Video  Project  of  ECODEFENSE!,  an
international environmental group,  was issued on May 26, 1996
in Kaliningrad/Koenigsberg  of  Baltic  Sea  region'  part  of
Russia. It's a fifth film is  released  by  the  group  during
1995-1996  in  its  pioneer  project  to educate environmental
activists in   Russia   and   ex-USSR   through   the   video.
     
"Environmental education  -  Metamorphosis",  a new video,  is
looking at  the  problems  of  the  environmental education in
Russia: how  to  organize  that,  to  start  and  continue the
environmental education programmes.  In  the  film,  Alexandra
Koroleva, the    coordinator   for   environmental   education
programmes at ECODEFENSE!  is trying to show new and  original
ways to educate the children in the kindergartens and schools.
It also  is  focused  on  possible  street  actions  with  the
involvement of children, not only room lessons.
     
"If we'd like our children to grow up with the sensitivity for
the nature, if we'd like to get new generations  which will be
ready to  protect  and  save  our  Mother-Earth   -   WE   ARE
ENVIRONMENTALISTS SHOULD  START to run environmental education
programmes everywhere.  In that case,  we'll get the hope that
next generations will love the Earth and do  everything,  even
environmental direct   actions,  to  keep  her  alive",-  says
Alexandra Koroleva.  She spent more than 15 years  to  prepare
and implement  in the schools and kindergartens the children's
programmes about the  nature.  Alexandra  is  also  organizing
regular seminars  for  the schoolteachers,  she is working for
worldwide well-known  IUCN'  commission   on   education   and
communication as representative of Russia.
     
ECODEFENSE! is  expanding  its environmental education program
for last three years and has about  five  kindergartens  as  a
participants in the program. This kindergartens in Kaliningrad
are organizing regular  courses  including  elements  of  deep
ecology for  its  children leading by Alexandra Koroleva.  The
environmental group is also publishing  "Igorny  Dom"  journal
which is focused on new methodics in children' education about
the environment.  The  journal  was  started  by   mid   1996,
two thousands   of   copies   for   each   issue  are  already
distributed. ECODEFENSE!  has  many  more  requests  for  this
journal from  all over the ex-USSR that makes "Igorny Dom" top
popular educational journal at least in Russia.
     
"Actually ECODEFENSE!  is focused on non-violent environmental
direct actions  during  its  history  but  we  are paying much
attention to  environmental  education  because   the   direct
actions and environmental education for children are only ways
to protect  our  Mother-Earth",  -  says   Vladimir   Sliviak,
ECODEFENSE! group chairman and co-founder.
"That's why I'm personally involved in the  video  making  and
the editing  of  that second journal of ECODEFENSE!.  The main
question for the future is  who  will  replace  the  activists
struggling and  defending  the Earth now,  who will be able to
stop corporations or governments from the destruction  of  the
nature. We  sure  that  new  people  will come to continue our
protecting work if we'll  continue  to  educate  children  and
their parents about how beautiful is our Earth", - he ends.

programmes or ECODEFENSE!  in  general  you  can  contact  the

ACTION UPDATE, June 1996
     

1. NO NUKES

The 1996' spring was focusing anti-nuclear activists  worlwide
for the   commemoration   of  10th  anniversary  of  Chernobyl
accident. The Ecodefenders were also involved in  this  Action
Day. In   Kaliningrad/Koenigsberg   ECODEFENSE!  with  ex-USSR
antinuclear campaign were organizing some events on 26 and  27
of April, such as the meetings of local citizens and youth and
lectures with  Harvey  Wasserman,  well-known  US  antinuclear
activists who visited Kaliningrad that time.  TV was attracted
a lot by. Harvey was giving some interview from Kaliningrad to
american broadcasting stations on 26 of April.  Thanks for the
media work,  Harvey.  We  hope  you'll  be back sometime.

Note for videomakers: video is available from ECODEFENSE!

Also, some   of   ecodefenders   went   to   Kiev/Ukraine  and
participated in the direct action on  23  of  April  when  the
police arrested about 20 activists with unreasonable violence.
Such ecodefenders as Vladimir  Sliviak  and  Nadia  Shevchenko
were jailed  there  for  3  days and trying to make trial over
violent policemen now.

Special edition of ECODEFENSE! journal was published in April,
including different  info-materials  about  Chernobyl disaster
and antinuclear movement.  The Kaliningrad city  looked  great
with red  leaflets ECODEFENSE!' activists putted on the walls.
Chernobyl T-shirts were made in mid-april and  we  still  have
some, but if you'd like to get one - be faster.

Note for videomakers: video is available from ECODEFENSE!


2. ENERGY PROJECT

Three ecodefenders are still working to  prepare  huge  energy
report responding  to  the  questions:  what's  the  renewable
energy sources of Kaliningrad region,  why the region need not
nuclear power,  what's  the  alternatives  to  present  energy
system in the region,  etc. The project is started by mid 1996
and will  be  ended  by December of 1996.  It'll be first same
analysis of the energy system in the region for last 60 years.
The energy  report  will  be  unique source of information for
scientists and activists.


3. ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION

The environmental  education coordinators,  Alexandra Koroleva
and Galina Kucheneva,  are running their  educational  program
with kindergarten'  children.  Three  days  per  week they are
talking with children about the  Mother-Earth,  her  ecosystem
and teach  beautiful  childs  how  to live in harmony with the
nature. "The  Green  Way"  program,  Alexandra  prepared   and
implements, is working with children of 5-7 age for full year,
three times per week.  Yet,  Alexandra is regularly organizing
the excursions  and  lectures for the schoolteachers on how to
implement environmental education in the  schools.

Note for  videomakers:  video  of  lessons  and  excursions is
available from ECODEFENSE!

If you're  planning to visit Kaliningrad and would like to see
that educational work - call us and you'll see this  beautiful
educational work.

At present time, Galina Kucheneva is out of the city with some
students to  show them something nice into the environment but
she'll be back soon.

ECODEFENSE! also  issued  new video on environmental education
(see Video Project chapter).

The second issue of new ECODEFENSE! journal  on  environmental
education (Igorny Dom) will be released soon (see Publications
chapter).


4. "YOUTH INVOLVEMENT" PROGRAM AND THE CAMP

ECODEFENSE! continues  to  involve  the youth in environmental
activity. It was about 60 young  people  last  year  who  were
participants at  the  Baltic  Environmental  Youth  Camp  near
Baltic Sea, at national park "Kuronian Spit" near Kaliningrad.
Different workshops  and  practical  environmental  protection
activity (including one street direct action)  were  organized
by the  summer  of 1995 with main goal:  to involve as many as
possible youg people to the environmental  activity  on  local
level.

In 1996, same camp will take place at same place. This time we
are waiting more than  100  participants  from  all  over  the
Kaliningrad region.  Will  be  invited  some  more people as a
guests from the ex-USSR and the Eastern Europe  to  give  some
lectures on  community  organizing.  The  camp will take place
from July 19 to July 28.  Four days before the camp,  on  July
15, the    seminar   on   community   organizing   for   young
environmental activists will take place in  Kaliningrad.  Come
and Enjoy.

Note for  videomakers:  video of the camp in 1995 is available
from ECODEFENSE!


5. "SAVE THE TREES" CAMPAIGN

Most radical  campaign  of  ecodefenders,  organizing   direct
actions to protect the trees, last years mainly in the city,
will be probably reanimated again.  At least,  some  activists
who did  the  campaign  in  1992-1994  came  back  with better
spirit. Some more campaign people are still alive and  working
for ECODEFENSE!  <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>So</a>  maybe this summer will become a nightmare
for the tree cutters and their "new russian" hosts again.

Note for  videomakers:  we  are  planning  to  have some great
action video, contact us later.


6. VIDEO PROJECT

As it  was  announced  the  fifth video of the project is just
released. "Environmental  Education  -   Metamorphosis",   new
video, will  be  soon available on VHS tapes.  18 minutes film
shows how to organize environmental education process with the
children and  even  what's  the street actions you can do with
children, for example on the Earth Day.  Anyway, we think it's
a really  successfull film for those who are interested in the
environmental education methodics with deep ecology  elements.
The ECODEFENSE!'  video-team  is:  Pavel  Malyshev,  Alexandra
Koroleva, Boris Dzasohov, Vladimir Sliviak.

Four previous videos of the project are:
"The non-violent  direct  actions"  -  about history a little,
about present days a little. Mostly about the campaign to stop
the construction  of  oil  terminal  in Ukraine and the direct
action activity during UN climate summit in Berlin/ Germany in
1995. Time: 20 min.
"The seasons  of  the  year:  the  spring"   -   environmental
education video  helping  to  indicate  something  good (first
spring flowers) in something bad (industrial city).  Great for
relaxation (actually  one professional interpreter bought that
for relaxation after hard working days). Time: 36 min.
"My good  actions  on the planet Earth" - video version of the
story that one beautiful child of 6 years  old  wrote  in  the
school. Impossible  to  understand that childs of same age can
think about that. Everyone should look at. Time: 10 min.
"As wolves  die  <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a>  does  freedom"  - it's made for "stop the
murder of wolves" campaign of ECODEFENSE!.  This  campaign  is
started by   December   of   1994   in   Kaliningrad.  Lot  of
publications and some performances were organized during  1995
by this  campaign.  This  film  is  a  video  version  of  the
performance with  same  name   which   was   showed   in   the
Kaliningrad' House   of  Teacher  during  the  celebration  of
professional holyday "Day of Teacher" there.  Some pieces from
the "Thinking  like a mountain" book were used to prepare that
performance. Time: 26 min.

All the videos are in Russian and available from ECODEFENSE!.


7. "STOP THE MURDER OF WOLVES" CAMPAIGN

The campaign  organized some direct actions,  performances and
publications in 1995.  Big critical report on Russian  Law  to
protect the  wild  nature  was  prepared  by the activist last
autumn. At present time the campaign is working on issues  how
to free  animals  from the zoopark.  Last action took place on
the celebration of 100  anniversary  of  Kaliningrad  zoopark,
this spring.  Some  activists  protested against the jails for
animals in the front of Kaliningrad zoopark with  big  banner.
No arrests.

Activists are also preparing the report for the Wolf Federtion
congress which  will take place next autumn in Belgum.  It was
also the idea in the campaign to organize the Action  Day  for
Wolf Protection by December 1. We'll see.


8. PUBLICATIONS

As it  was  announced,  ECODEFENSE!  started  to  publish  new
journal on  environmental  education.  "Igorny  Dom"  (Playing
House), new journal, is focused for new methodics in children'
environmental education with deep  ecology  elements.  It  was
about 2000  copies  of first issue which were distributed very
fast. The journal become a top educational journal in  Russia.

Mara Silina: Friends Of the Earth Europe East-West Programme:

Plans 1996 (draft version for discussions during the FOEE Annual
Meeting in Ohrid, FYRo Macedonia and emended for the BUND
working groups's meeting in Cologne)

Introduction

In 1988 Friends of the Earth International (FOEI) started a
special programme on Central and Eastern Europe (CCE). Its
purpose was to give support to and cooperate with the newly
emerging independent CEE environmental movements. The programme
was initiated by FOE-Italy, but since 1990 the coordination is
done by FOE-Europe (FOEE). Since then FOEE had a staff for this
purpose of two persons, one (John Hontelez) working from the
Brussels office, the other (Mara Silina) was working from an
office in Bratislava (Slovakia), specially set up for this
programme. Following the decision of FOEE Annual General Meeting
(AGM) in FRankfurt 1993 we have closed FOE East office in
Bratislava since June 1994 and Mara Silina is now working from
FOEE office in Brussels. Furthermore, John Hontelez has become a
policy coordinator of FOEE since August 1st, 1994, and has
stopped working for the East-West Programme.

FOEE has ten members in the following CEE and New Independent
States (NIS) (fruehere Sowjetunion) countries:

Bulgaria				National Movement of Ecoglasnost;

Czech Republic			Hnuti Duha / Rainbow Movement;

Estonia				Estonian Green Movement;

Georgia				Green Movement of Georgia;

Hungary				National Society of Conservationists;

Latvia				VAK / Environmental Protection Club of Latvia;

Lithuania				Lithuanian Green Movement;

Macedonia, Former Yug. Rep. of	DEM / Ecological Movement of
Macedonia;

Poland				PKE / Polish Ecological Club;

Ukraine				Zelenyi Svit / Green World.

The objectives of the programme are as follows:

General Support and strengthening of the environmental movement
in CEE;

Stimulation and development of East-East and East-West
cooperation especially leading to campaigns;

Liaison - political lobbying on the European level with special
emphasis on CEE environment;

Financial clearinghouse to identify potential funding for
projects and campaigns.

This programme should be seen as evolving plan on necessities
and opportunities elements may be changed, added, deleted
throughout the year in close cooperation with FOE groups in the
region. 

Programme 1996: (Final version will be produced after the
workshop on the programme in Ohrid)

1.A.	General Support and strengthening of the environmental
movement:

1.A.1	PHARE/TACIS Democracy Projects (in progress):

Phare and Tacis are the programmes of the European Union (EU) to
support the CEE and NIS countries. Two projects in the frame of
Phare Democracy Projects will go on till July 1996 for Lithuania
and till September 1996 for Poland. FOEE is the EU partner for
both of them which means that we have a role to advise our
groups on the implementation of projects and organise a
western-groups' participation where needed as well as to
communicate with EU about these projects. Until March 1996 FOEE
is involved in the Tacis Democracy Programme for Green Movement
in Georgia.

1.A.2	PHARE/TACIS Democracy Projects (new ones):

During the year there will be another opportunity (ies) to
introduce projects for Phare/Tacis Democracy Projects (the first
deadline will be April 30th) and therefore the first ideas from
the groups have been collected and wherever possible will be
discussed during the Annual meeting. For developing these
projects I can think about two different things at the same time:

follow up proposals for the groups involved in the past. This
could include expanding the existing programme or choosing a
special campaigns focus, like the introduction of principles of
"Sustainable Europe" Programme.

similar projects as before for our members which didn't manage
to be involved in the previous ones.

Phare/Tacis Democracy Programme is only one programme we have
used <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> far. But there certainly will be an opportunity to
participate in Phare Partnership Programme (deadline 29th,
1996), LIEN (deadline April 30th, 1996), RTD (Research and
Technological Development - deadline February29th, 1996)
programme and may be some more. More information will be
provided. Groups which have expressed their interest to develop
projects in the frame of Phare/Tacis Democracy and Phare
Partnership Programmes are FOE Hungary, FOE Bulgaria, FOE
Macedonia and FOE Ukraine.

1.B.	Information / Education:

"New items for East and Central Europe":

New Items II will be finished by the end of March 1996. But as I
have an indication that the project has been and is very useful
I am allready thinking about the new series of similar
publications. This means work on two things: issues for the next
publications and fundraising for these issues. Issues, which
have been mentioned by some of our groups include: WB activities
in CEE; Enlargement of the EU towards CEE and the consequences
of this integration; Environmental Action Plan for CEE (EAP) and
NEAP's and how to use these things in environmental policy
making; Sustainable Europe - experience from CEE; Sustainable
agriculture; Western assistance to the environment of CEE;
Environmental consumerism; Hazardous waste; Sustainable
transport; Sustainable use of water; Sustainable energy.

Like the first series of "New Items", the booklets would be
practical and instrumental for further reading as well as
campaining and will be published in seven languages. This might
change depending from funding. <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>So</a> far we have had six issues in
one Year's time (or close to that). What I feel while manageing
the project is that it's too much of a burden to you and me and
we may be can reduce it to four issues a year. Concerning
fundraising - we might get some money from the EC, Charity Know
How or someone else and I can start doing this part of the work
as soon as we agree on the issues.

2.	Stimulation and development of East-East and East-West
cooperation:

I am just listing some things which are ongoing (agriculture,
sustainable Europe), some where we have done something but did
not go further with our joint activities (Black Sea). Some
things have been mentioned during our meetings (Baltic Sea) and
somewhere we have to define FOEE's role more precisely (MDB).

2.1 Agriculture: For two years we are working together with
Georgian Greens on a sustinable agriculture project supported by
the European Commission (Phare). The projects are focussed on
the promotion and practical implementation on ecological
agriculture and raising of awareness of the public about the
advantages of its products. (The project descriptions, for which
at least 20% of the funds need to come from other sources than
the EC, are available.)

2.2 Baltic Sea: Needs further discussions with FOEI Ocean
Foundation and FOE groups concerned.

2.3 Black Sea: We will build upon our inititiatives and the
contacts developed with UNDP and TACIS for the following
activities:

Regular distribution of relevant information to NGOs around the
Black Sea and in the Danube River Basin;

possible reviving the Black sea coalition we initiated in 1992
(if needed);

application with the Black Sea Convention Secretariat in
Istanbul for observer status with the convention after agreement
with the relevant FOEI-groups;

Assisting in monitoring and influencing the GEF programme on the
Black Sea, the implementation of the Black sea Convention and
Economical Cooperation of Black sea countries, raising funds for
this purpose with UNDP and TACIS;

Stimulating cooperation, public awareness and clean up campaigns
around the Blaclk Sea, again with funds of UNDP and TACIS.

2.4 Sustainable Europe in CEE: Needs to be dicussed with the
groups as they should start campaigning in their own countries.

2.5 MDB campaign / network in CEE: The initiative to start
campaign on MDBs in CEE has been brought up by several FOE
groups in the region which had their meeting in Brno,
mid-December 1994. A proposal for regular netwokring and
fundraising is under preperation. FOEE East-west programme is
prepared to assist.

2.6 Chernobyl Ten Years Anniversary.

2.7 Balkan Cooperation.

3.	Liaison - political lobbying on the European level:

3.1 EAP for Central and Eastern Europe: (see a seperate document
by Mara silina and John hontelez "the Sofia Conference and
beyond"). This is an issue where FOEE (joint project with
Milieukontakt Oost-Europa) has been involved as an international
organisation and had its political role play. And we also have
tried to involve our memebr-groups more actively. We will have a
half-day workshop in Ohrid just before FOEE AGM where we can
discuss all major issues in this respect. Briefly, the Sofia
follow-up activities will include:

Implementation of the EAP and development of NEAP's;

Focus on policy reforms and integration of environmental
concerns into economic / social policies;

Environmental financing - further work on mechanisms to be used
in CEEC;

Negotiations with NGOs/EAP TF/PPC on project development(s);

Quality of the assistance programmes (could be linked with the
New Items booklet);

Our Sustainable Europe to be linked with the integrated policies
and post Sofia;

New Items booklet on these issues.

3.2 Enlargement of the EU: This will become an issue very soon
in all associate countries, therefore we should be prepared for
broader debates. Just a few things to be mentioned to start
working with:

Working with the documents from the EU and provoking debates in
the countries. Introducing these agreements to environmental
organisations (debates in countries, workshop(s), New Items
booklet, international workshop etc.);

May be to organise a workshop in Brussels for CEE
environmentalists on the enlargement;

Comments on the documents - issue by issue on the main areas -
environment, transport, agriculture, energy etc.

Setting up a project and raising funbds collectively for itto
have a research unit for White Paper for CEEC environment;

Working closely with the Technical Assistance Information
Exchange office in the Commission.

Concerning the last objective for East-West programme about the
fundraising clearinghouse - some small things have happened but
not on regular basis and not much outside the EU. <a name=L10003></a><a href=#L10004>So</a>, there is
still a space to improve and I would like to spend some time on
that.

Das nachstehend becshrieben Projekt ist besser bekannt unter dem
Namen STEF-Projekt (Sustainable Tourism on Ecological Farms).
Mit dieser Initiative soll eine lanfristige Unterstuetzung der
oekologisch wirtschaftenden Landwirte durch nachhaltigen
Tourismus gewaehrleistet werden. Die Ziele des Projekts sind:

Foerderung des oekologischen Landbaus durch nachhaltigen
Tourismus;

Aktiver Umwelt- und Naturschutz in Europa;

Oeko-Sensibilisierung der Landwirte sowie der Touristen;

Schaffung eines europaeischen Netzwerks;

Training der involvierten Landwirte und der nationalen
ECEAT-Vertreter;

Entwicklung von entsprechenden Marketingstrategien.

Das Instrument zur erreichung der Ziele liegt im praktischen
Ansatz. Durch die Foerderung von Eigeninitiativen der Landwirte
und deren Erfolg in ihrer Region wird ein Schneeballeffekt
erzielt. Die Existenzsicherung durch den Nebenerwerb mit
Tourismus ist zwar nicht in allen Faellen erfolgversprechend,
aber falls doch finden sich in der Region viele Nachahmer. Die
Arbeitsschritte sind zumindest in den osteuropaeischen Laendern
gleich:

Aufbau einer unabhaenigen nationalen Koordinierungsstelle;

Training der meist ehrenamtlichen Nationalkoordinatoren;

Aufbau von regionalen Kontaktbueros;

Unterstuetzung der Landwirte durch Information, Training und der
Beschaffung von oeffentlichen Mitteln zum Ausbau der Hoefe;

Entwicklung eines Marketingkonzepts fuer die Region und
europaweit;

Ergebnissicherung, Erfolgskontrolle und Korrektur.

In den weteuropaeischen Laendern bestehen meist schon relativ
starke Initiativen, auch wenn sie nicht oekologisch ausgerichtet
sind. In diesem Falle gilt es erst recht, eine positive Politik
zu betreiben, die Existenz der Oeko-Landwirte zu sichern und die
entsprechende Lobbyarbeit zu ermoeglichen. Das Projekt begann
vor vier Jahren in Polen mit ein paar Hoefen, mittlerweile haben
sich in 15 Laendern Europas ueber 600 Biohoefe zu dieser
Initiative ziusammengechlossen. Fuer jedes Land wird in den
Niderlanden eine Broschuere mit einer Beschreibung des Landes,
der Gegebenheiten und der einzelnen Hoefe gedruckt. Im Jahr 1994
wurden 5.000 dieser Broschueren verkauft und etwa 4.000
Touristen besuchten die Hoefe mit 10.000 Uebernachtungen. Fuer
1996 wird eine Kooperation mit Reiseveranstaltern angestrebt, da
mittlerweile ganze Doerfer in den Broschueren anbieten. fuer die
Zukunft wird in Erwaegung gezogen, die Projektidee auf den
gesamten Bereich der laendlichen Region auszuweiten, die dann
unter anderem kleinere Hotels, Angebote von Naturschutzgebieten
und oeffentlichen Einrichtungen, wie Jugendherbergen umfasst.
Die Vorbedingungen ist bei allen jedoch die oekologische
Ausrichtung. Deshalb arbeitet die ECEAT seit diesem Jahr an
Umweltqualitaetskriterien fuer ein nachhaltiges Tourismusangebot.

ARMENIEN

Die Union der Gruenen Armeniens wird in ihrer Arbeit behindert.

von Sylvia Gressier, Februar 1996 - Infolge der widrigen
Lebensbedingungen (kein Strom, kein Wasser und keine Heizung),
mit denen die Armenier zur Zeit zu kaempfen haben, ist das Thema
Umweltschutz bei der Bevoelkerung natuerlich kleingeschrieben.
Die Nachricht von der Reparatur und dem Wiederanschluss des
Blocks Nr. 11 im Atomkraftwerk Medzamor unweit von Jerewan im
Herbst vergangenen Jahres wurde von grossen Teilen der
Bevoelkerung in Armenien mit der Hoffnung auf Strom und damit
auf die Normalisierung der Lebenssituation nach fast acht Jahren
ohne bzw. nur mit stundenweiser Elektrizitaetsversorgung
verbunden.

Die schwierige oekonomische Situation, in der das Land steckt,
tut das Seinige, die Bevoelkerung fuer Fragen des Umweltschutzes
voellig unsensibel zu machen. Die einzige NGO, die sich zur Zeit
diesem Thema widmet, firmiert unter der Bezeichnung Union der
Gruenen Armeniens. Sie existiert bereits seit 1930 als Bewegung
einiger Einzelpersonen, die auf die Austrocknung des Sewan-Sees
aufgrund eines Wasserkraftwerkes hinwiesen. In der Zeit der
Glasnost fanden sich mehrere aktive Gruppierungen, die im
Bereich Umweltschutz in Armenien aktiv waren und auf die
Freveltaten des sowjetischen Regimes aufmerksam machten.
Armeniens Wirtschaft bestand hauptsaechlich aus verarbeitender
Industrie. Chemiewerke und vor allem ein riesiges Kautschukwerk
in Jerewan verschmutzten die Luft in der Stadt stark, bevor die
Energieblockade einsetzte. Die armenischen Umweltschuetzer
schlossen sich 1989 zur Union der Gruenen Armeniens zusammen.

In einem Interview im Oktober 1995 berichtete der Praesident
dieser NGO, Hakop A. Sanarsajan, dass man sich zur Zeit vor
allem mit der Ausarbeitung eines Lebensmittelkontrollgesetzes
beschaeftige. Diese Arbeit sei jedoch ins Stocken geraten, da
das Geld fuer die Entlohnung der Fachleute, die an dem
Gesetzesentwurf gearbeitet haetten, ausgegangen sei. Auch fuer
den Bereich Abwasser und Abgase wolle die armenische Regierung
ein entsprechendes Gesetz einfuehren. Bei der Untersuchung
vergleichbarer Gesetze europaeischer Staaten sei die schwedische
Variante als Vorbild fuer Armenien als die geeigneteste erkannt
worden.

Ein Projekt, das von den USA mit 30.000 USD finanziert wird, ist
der Aufbau einer Biogasfabrik. Die Union der Gruenen Armeniens
hat sich u.a. der Verteilung von Informationsmaterial in Form
von Broschueren ueber diese Art der Energiegewinnung mit einer
Auflagenhoehe von 4.000 Exemplare angenommen.

Das Thema Nr. 1 der Umweltschuetzer Armeniens sei jedoch immer
noch der Kampf gegen den Wiederanschluss des Atomkraftwerkes
Medzamor, sagte Hakop Sanarsajan Diese Arbeit wird durch
offizielle Stellen behindert. <a name=L10004></a><a href=#L10005>So</a> haetten im Radio keine
Stellungnahmen gegen die Wiederherstellung des AKWs in Armenien
gesendet werden duerfen.

In diesem Zusammenhang beklagte sich der Leiter dieser NGO auch
allgemein ueber die Methoden der Regierung, die Arbeit der
Gruenen in der oeffentlichkeit Armeniens zu diskreditieren. In
den Zeitungen seien Artikel von Journalisten erschienen, denen
er zwar ein Interview gegeben haette, deren Inhalt aber
keineswegs mit dem Inhalt der Publikationen uebereinstimmte. In
ihnen beschuldige die Regierung die Gruenen, dass sie den Anlass
fuer die Schliessung von Fabriken gegeben haetten. Die Fabriken
stuenden jedoch in Wirklichkeit wegen der Energieblockade, dem
Mangel an Rohmaterial und aufgrund der allgemeinen
Wirtschaftskrise im Land still. Die Umweltschutz-NGO habe keine
Moeglichkeit, sich gegen diese Art von Anschuldigungen zur Wehr
zu setzen. Die Bevoelkerung wuerde <a name=L10005></a><a href=#L10006>so</a> jedoch gegen die Arbeit
die Gruenen aufgehetzt.

Diese unguenstige Einstellung gegenueber Umweltschuetzern in der
armenischen Bevoelkerung gepaart mit chronischem Geldmangel
lassen die Arbeit der Union der Gruenen Armeniens zu einem kaum
spuerbaren Element in der oeffentlichkeit dieses
Transkaukasus-Staates schrumpfen.

Uebrigens arbeitet zwar seit Dezember 1995 der Block Nr. 11 des
Atomkraftwerks Medzemor mit voller Kapazitaet, doch die
Situation in bezug auf die Stromversorgung in Jerewan hat sich
keinesfalls verbessert. Nach wie vor werden die Wohnungen der
Stadt nur nachts und das auch nicht durchgaengig und
regelmaessig mit Strom versorgt. Es kursieren Geruechte, dass
der armenische Staat die in Medzamor gewonnene Elektroenergie an
Georgien verkauft.

Water Level In Sevan Getting Stabilized

YEREVAN - The level of water in lake Sevan decreased by 6 cm
this year. Head of the Water resources department of the
Ministry of Environment Protection O.Kirakosian believes this is
a significant progress which shows that the level of water in
the lake is getting stabilized. The level has dropped by over
100 cm during the last two years. Stabilization of water level
is a result of virtually six times decrease of water drainage
from the lake this year. Mr. Kirakosian hoped that with full
operation of ANPP in 1996, drainage of water for power
production will completely stop. A corresponding decision has
been accepted by the government, and affirmed by the National
Council. Head of Water Resources department believes that the
level of water will gradually increase. It will probably grow by
150-200 cm when hydrotechnical constructions are built on the
river of Vorotan, to connect it with Arpa. Mr. Kirakosian added
that the World Bank allocated $ 485 thousands for the
development of ecological project for the lake.

BALTIKUM

New Road Through Baltic States

A 1,000-kilometre road linking Helsinki to Warsaw via the Baltic
states' capitals will be improved through a $180 million
project, the Nordic Investment Bank said on Monday. "The
Governments of the countries concerner are backing a $180
million investment programme, which in turn is closely connected
with the European Commission's commitment to faster and smoother
border crossing," the Nordic Investment Bank said. The
investments will allow the road link, called the Via Baltica, to
be upgraded over a five-year period into a smooth inyternational
link from its current status as separate national roads within
the five countries it crosses. Travellers in Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania - which only emerged as independent states five years
ago - say roads linking the countries are dangerous and
unreliable. "For the first time, it's being treated as a
continuous transport route, with a single, intercountry
development programme", Nordic Investment Bank said in a
statement. A working party comprised of Estonian, Latvian,
Lithuanian, Finnish and Polish governments, the European
Commission, the World Bank, The European Investment Bank and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development set up the
programme. Money will be used to widen and upgrade 445
kilometres of the road and its bridges, improve city links and
place international road signs along the route. Border crossing
times will be greatly reduced, the bank said. Roadside services
such as hotels and restaurants will improve, mainly due to
private investments, the Bank said. Some 5,000 cars per day use
the road in the four adjacent countries, according to 1995
estimates, the working group said. The countries are linked to
Finland across the Gulf of Finland by a ferry link.

One small step for eastern Europe

By Martin Wright - Eastern Europe is widely seen as an
environmental basket case; its pollution problems vast and
hopelessly complex, costing trillions of dollars to clean up,
with little prospect of any return on investment. It ain't
necessarily <a name=L10006></a><a href=#L10007>so</a>. The right combination of political decisiveness
and an eye for economic opportunity long-term, can move
mountains - even turn them into molehills. On the Estonian
island of Dago sits a (very) concrete case in point. Dago was a
closed military area until 1990, a forward outpost of the Soviet
empire. Its isolation was something of an environmental plus:
Dago and its coastal waters are home to a host of animals and
plants which are rare elsewhere in the Baltic. The whole island,
with a population of just 12,000, has been designated a
biosphere reserve. 

Until this year, however, there was one major problem. Raw
sewage from the island's main industrial area at Korgessaare
poured virtually untreated straight into the sea. It was killing
off the coastal fisheries which were the lifeblood of the town's
canning factory. The town's Soviet-era plant, installed in the
early '80s, had never worked properly and was now in a state of
terminal disrepair. The cash-strapped local municipality lacked
the resources either to repair or replace it and work such as
this was too small-scale to qualify for World Bank assistance.
But it proved to be perfect for an initiative launched by
Stockholm Water Action (SWA). The Swedish capital prides itself
on having some of the cleanest urban water in the world: It is
safe to swim or fish from waterfronts in the heart of town. It's
an achievement celebrated in the city's annual water festival
and symposium, run by the Stockholm Water Foundation. By the end
of 1993, the foundation had decided that some of this
achievement should be exported to its former Eastern-bloc
neighbors across the Baltic, and Stockholm Water Action was
born. 

SWA asked the various Baltic governments to come up with water
treatment problems. Estonia was the swiftest to respond and Dago
soon emerged as the ideal candidate. It had a pressing need and
a relatively simple solution. What happened then is an object
lesson in the triumph of will, turning dreams into reality at
unprecedented speed. SWA assembled an impressive alliance of
companies and experts: from engineering giants like ITT Flygt
and ABB, to accountants, lawyers and smaller contractors, with
Scandiaconsult taking the project leadership role. 

The first site visit to Dago took place in February 1994. By
early May, '95 - a mere 17 months after the idea was first
mooted - the plant was up and running. Next to the wreck of its
old Soviet plant, Korgessaare now has a small, simple but highly
effective sewage works, pumping clean water out to sea and
providing dried fertilizer for local farms. The total cost was
roughly $900,000 - a surprisingly small sum, taking into account
the fact that the plant is treating around 60 percent of the
total wastewater load of the island. It works out at around $50
per person per year, or about half the average rate. With local
industry reliant on local fish stocks - already showing signs of
recovery - the investment should repay itself many times over.
Clean coastal waters are also essential to Dago's efforts to
promote itself as a center for eco-tourism. 

Dago is intended to be the first of a series of such
initiatives. SWA will help local authorities identify pressing
needs, locate sources of funding (either sponsorship, such as
the Nordic Investment Bank), tackle the technical problems and,
last but not least, set up financial structures with the aim of
making each project pay for itself. Appropriate technology is a
guiding principle -- the projects are designed to be run,
repaired and maintained by local workers using, as far as
possible, locally manufactured materials, <a name=L10007></a><a href=#L10008>so</a> avoiding dependency
on costly Western technology. 

And maybe start turning a few of those mountains into molehills.

FIRST ESTONIAN-RUSSIAN ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENT SIGNED

by Nathaniel Trumbull. Pskov, Russia - The first-ever
environmental agreement between Estonia and the the Russian
Federation was signed on January 11 and represents a major step
toward future Estonian-Russian environmental cooperation. The
agreement was signed by ministerial heads in the ancient city of
Pskov which lies 60 kilometers from the still disputed
Estonian-Russian territory of the Pechory region. The signed
agreement lays the framework for future cooperative
environmental research and scholarly exchange between Estonia
and Russia to begin already this year. All cooperative
environmental research between Estonia and Russia came to a halt
after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Environmental
information on the condition of Lake Chudskoe (Lake Peipsi in
Estonian), which lies in the border area between Estonia and the
Russian Federation and is the fifth largest lake in Europe, has
not been shared between researchers on either side of the lake
for the last four years. Standardization of environmental
measurements on both sides of the lake and border, for example,
is no longer coordinated today. The bilateral environmental
agreement was signed by Minister of the Environment Villu
Reiljan of Estonia and First Deputy Minister of the Environment
Alexei Poryadin of Russia. In addition to the Finnish Deputy
Minister of the Environment, Kari Kaurilehto, the Finnish consul
to St. Petersburg and the Estonian consul to Pskov attended the
signing. During the course of discussions between the three
countries, it became clear that the Finnish Ministry of the
Environment has been playing a key role in aiding the Estonian
and Russian sides to begin to cooperate in the environmental
sphere. The Finnish delegation often assumed the role of
mediator between the Estonian and Russian delegations, ensuring
that decisions were made which were amenable to both Estonian
and Russian sides. Yet the signing of the first Estonian-Russian
environmental agreement can only be considered a partial
success. Only one of two prepared agreements was in the end
signed. The signing of a second agreement, outlining cooperative
environmental work on the water basin of Lake Chudskoe in
particular, has been delayed. Official disagreement over exact
territorial boundaries in the Pechory and Narva regions between
Estonia and Russia continues to make a signing of that second
agreement impossible today, said Estonian Minister of the
Environment Villu Reiljan. A resolution of this border problem
is nevertheless expected in the coming weeks. The water basin
agreement will likely be signed by the end of February,
according to both the Estonian and Russian delegations. The
meeting also included final negotiations on a trilateral
memorandum between Estonia, Finland, and Russia concerning
planning for the Year of the Gulf of Finland in 1996. Because
Lake Chudskoe flows directly into the Gulf of Finland, Pskov
Oblast is to be included in the activities of the Year of the
Gulf of Finland. Activities are to include cooperative
ecological research, improvements in international
transportation, and a wide range of other technical projects in
the Gulf region. The transboundary region of the Lake Chudskoe
watershed is not without its specific environmental problems,
according to Victor Zvonkov, Deputy Head of Pskov Oblast. One of
the most difficult problems concerns the absence of almost any
communication between the Estonian and Russian sides today. Any
environmental work on Lake Chudskoe, for example, is futile
without mutual support from both sides, Mr. Zvonkov said.
Pollution on either side of Lake Chudskoe immediately threatens
Estonian or Russian residents on either other side of lake. The
militarization of the region has also increased in recent years,
with the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe and the
Baltic states to Pskov Oblast. The territory of Pskov Oblast is
larger than Estonia, Belgium, or Holland, and represents one of
the last territories in European Russia which can be considered
largely ecologically undisturbed. The signed environmental
agreement represents one of the first successes in renewing
official Estonian-Russian relations in any realm since 1991. The
Russian Federation has still not recognized the Tartu Peace
Agreement of 1920, the largest obstacle today to establishing
Estonian-Russian relations. As a result, only a handful of
intergovernmental agreements have been reached between Estonia
and Russia today. Martii Poutanen of the Finnish Ministry of the
Environment believes that Estonian-Russian relations have "not
had enough time to develop" since the collapse of the Soviet
Union. Mr. Poutanen expects relations to develop normally as
soon as today's difficult stage of mutual suspicion and distrust
in relations and cooperation is overcome.

LAKE PEIPSI PROJECT PRESS RELEASE

OBINITSA, ESTONIA - A working meeting of local groups from the
border region of Estonia and Russia lying to the south of Lake
Chudskoe (Lake Peipsi in Estonian) took place on January 26,
1996 in the Estonian village of Obinitsa. Discussed at the
meeting was the possibility for the creation of a simplified
border-crossing procedure for local residents. Proposals for
social and economic cooperation in the transboundary region were
also discussed. Juri Vaidla, head of the Council of Elders of
the Congress of Sety of Estonia, and Victor Mikhilovich Isaev,
head of the Department of Inter-ethnic Relations of the
Administration of Pechory Region of Pskov Oblast, led the
working meeting. Mr. Isaev noted that some progress has been
made since the previous working meeting on November 21 of last
year. The ministries of foreign affairs of Russia and Estonia
have agreed to issue multiple visas for one-half year to the
elders of the border-area volosty (county) and uezdy (district)
of each country, which will help representatives of the border
region to work more efficiently on cooperative projects. In
mid-January, the Vyrusskii district administration discussed one
of the working group's project proposals for the development of
border trade. During this coming summer in Vastelinna, Estonia,
a seminar for tourist managers of the border region is planned
and will take place under the leadership of Swedish experts. At
the same time, the working group's project for the creation of a
simplified border-crossing procedure in the region has been
entirely halted. The Estonian representatives of the working
group had discussed the possibilities for a simplified crossing
with the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry in
turn contacted the embassy of the Russian Federation in Tallinn
in order to discuss the question. However, because of holidays,
and also because of the beginning of the next round of
intergovernmental border negotiations between Estonian and
Russian delegations, discussion of the question of a simplified
border crossing region on the southern border of Estonia and of
Russia gave no results. Participants of the working group do not
understand why at the northern part of the national border
between the cities of Ivangorod and Narva, some 12,000 people a
week cross the border by showing a pass, while on the southern
part of the border it is not possible to organize such a
simplified procedure. On the Latvian-Russian and
Estonian-Latvian borders a system of simplified regime has
already been organized. On the Latvian- Russian border, passes
are issued for three months to those people who have close
relatives on the other side. Practice shows that the simplified
border crossing procedure by a system of passes does not lead to
an increase in criminal activity in the region. Nina Komissaro,
head of the Panikovskii Volost of Pskov Oblast, emphasized that
organizing a simplified procedure is essential: the ethnic group
Sety live in the Pechory region live and generally they are
elderly, born from 1918-26 and their children presently live in
Estonia, largely in Tartu, Tallinn, and Pyl've. The elderly
require the frequent assistance of their children. However,
visas in Estonia to go to Russia are difficult to receive, and
also very expensive for them. In order to receive a visa, an
invitation is necessary. The elderly are required to go to
Pechory to apply for an invitation, which is also expensive,
almost an entire month's retirement payment. The existing system
of simplified border crossing by an established list does not
work correctly. At the meeting, representatives of the Vyrusski
Institute and the non-government organization "Chudskoe Project"
also presented their views on the problems of the region. As a
result of the discussions of the working group, a decision was
taken to create a new commission for the drawing up of a project
for a simplified border-crossing procedure. The commission will
be comprised of representatives of the volost and will work in
conjunction with the commission for simplified border crossing
which has been created on the inter-governmental level. It is
clear that the problem of a simplified crossing will not be
resolved until the Estonian and Russian governments can agree on
the exact delineation of the Estonian-Russian border.
Unfortunately, the last round of inter-governmental agreements
on the border on January 25-26 gave no results. Basic
disagreements between Estonia and Russia remain. The next
meeting of the working group is planned for May 17, 1996.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS OF TRANSBOUNDARY REGIONS

Representatives of regional ecological organizations,
journalists specializing in environmental issues, and concerned
citizens met to discuss the ecological problems of the
transboundary region of Northwest Russia, the Baltic states, and
Finland at the seminar "Environmental Problems of Transboundary
Regions" held on March 1 in St. Petersburg. The seminar was
organized by the Transboundary Environmental Information Agency
and financed by ISAR (former Institute for Soviet-American
Relations). Dr. Sergei Borisovich Lavrov, President of the
Russian Geographic Society, opened the morning session of the
seminar. Reforms of the last years in the newly independent
states have greatly complicated the geo-political situation in
the new border regions, according to Dr. Lavrov. Political
arguments and conflicts today in the border regions have
eclipsed previous interest in and concern over the environmental
problems of those regions, in his view. The state policies of
the Russian Federation are now unable to solve the critical
situation in the border regions, he said. Dr. Lavrov believes
that the realization of a plan of sustainable development in
those regions is possible today only on a local level and
through local initiatives. Ilkka Luotamo, the Finnish Consul to
St. Petersburg, reported on the history of and the reasons for
the designation of 1996 as the Year of the Gulf of Finland. The
Year is to include collaborative environmental studies among
scientists from throughout the region and international public
awareness programs concerning the environmental problems of the
Gulf of Finland. Irina Mikhailovna Markovets, Co-Chair of the
Working Group for Water Protection, and Valentina Viktorovna
Gol'tsova, research fellow at the Zoological Institute of the
Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg, also presented
information on the Year of the Gulf of Finland. 

Gulnara Ishkuzina-Roll, Director of the Lake Peipsi Project,
described the social and environmental problems of the
Estonian-Russian transboundary region of Lake Peipsi and
appealed to those journalists at the seminar to place more
emphasis on the local problems of the border regions in their
work. She emphasized that a large amount of the Lake Peipsi
Project's work involves bringing people from both sides of Lake
Peipsi together in order that communication can be improved and
cooperation begun in solving common problems existing on both
sides of the lake. (...) Aita Ottas, journalist of the Estonian
newspaper Postimees, gave her views on those environmental
problems which have been inherited by Estonia as a result of the
former presence of the Soviet army on Estonian territory. She
described the dilemma for Estonian authorities on the future use
of a former Soviet airfield, one of the largest in Europe today,
left on Estonian territory. 

A lively discussion took place in evaluating the environmental
problems in the transboundary region of the Northwest Region of
Russia and Finland. Alexei Grigor'ev, representative of the
Information Center of the Socio-Ecological Union (...) described
the critical situation of timber cutting in the previously
protected border zone of Russia-Finland. The Finnish Consul Mr.
Luotamo responded to Mr. Grigor'ev's critical remarks on the
activity of Finnish lumber companies in the Karelia region of
Northwest Russia. 

Representatives of other non-government organizations of St.
Petersburg, the Northwest Region, and Moscow also participated
in the seminar. Those organizations are based in St. Petersburg
(Kurgal'skaia Expedition), Apatity and Murmansk Oblast
(EKONORD), and Petrozavodsk (Association of the Greens of
Karelia), Pskov (Education and Information Center of Volnyi
University), and Moscow (Ekologia). A press conference,
organized by the Russian-American Press Center, concluded the
seminar.

LEEP

LEEP is a United States based charitable corporation formed and
operating under the auspices of six indigenous Central Asian
nonprofit nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who share a
common vision of building sustainable development and civil
societies in Central Asia. The individuals who comprise LEEP's
leadership have a long history of personal contact and
cooperation and represent several of Central Asia's oldest and
most established grassroots NGOs. As a formal extension of the
Central Asian NGO movement, LEEP is unique among American
organizations in its structure and management. With financial
support from the National Endowment for Democracy, LEEP began
its "Maintaining a Foothold for Democracy" program on January
24, 1996. This small program has three objectives:

to improve publication and distribution of Ecostan News, a free
monthly electronic journal, in its English, Russian, and German
editions;

to provide informational support, primarily via e-mail, to any
Central Asian NGO requesting such assistance. This assistance is
primarily in the form of copies of laws from any Western
country, and copies of articles from English, French, Italian,
and German language newspapers and journals published around the
world. However, using our American volunteers, other precisely
worded information requests can also be managed.

to provide fiscal and administrative support to selected Central
Asian NGOs. LEEP acts as a fiscal agent for nonprofits selected
by its Central Asian advisors; in most cases only requiring 1%
overhead for this service.

Also, LEEP acts as an intermediary between Central Asian NGOs
and US foundations by initiating contacts and translating
proposals.In Central Asia, LEEP's affiliate organizations are:

CENTRAL ASIAN DEMOCRACY NGOS TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS?

by Eric Sievers, LEEP - (...) While successful US governmental
and private democratic and environmental development programs
have been active in Central Asia since 1992, they are primary
victims of budget cutbacks and are beginning to close now,
several years earlier than anticipated. The half dozen major NGO
development projects in Central Asia (American Legal Consortium,
Counterpart Consortium, Eurasia Foundation, ISAR's Seeds of
Democracy, Mercy Corps, and National Endowment for Democracy)
are all funded with allocations from the US government, the
majority of them (and the largest) with funds from the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID). This year,
two or three of these programs are expected to close and one has
begun devoting considerably less attention to NGO development.
Next year, the roughly 250 NGOs which US development programs
(...) encouraged to continue to exist, expand their activities,
and build horizontal coalitions may be fighting for survival
among themselves for a piece of a comparatively disappointing
assistance package.

While the same problem of unexpected US funding policy shifts
affects other post-communist regions, in contrast to Central
Asia, dozens of private and European governmental democratic and
environmental assistance programs currently target Russia and
Eastern Europe. The US government, by comparison, currently
accounts for, I estimate, 90% of assistance for grassroots
secular NGOs in Central Asia. Various other organizations, such
as HIVOS and NOVIB (private development agencies supported by
the Dutch government), account for most of the remaining amount.
Other than occasional NGO support from Soros, there are no other
private or non-US funding sources currently located within
Central Asia. (...) The Ford Foundation and the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation offices in Moscow also are in
a position to provide a limited amount of funding for Central
Asian NGOs.

Similarly, Eastern Europe and Russia have much more developed
legislation and tax codes encouraging philanthropy, and, in some
cases, notable indigenous grant-making foundations and
government support programs for NGOs. In Central Asia, by
comparison, the restrictive Soviet-era registration and taxation
climate still prevails, and institutional philanthropy and
indigenous grant-making foundations are only now forming. They
still require several years to become effective. My estimate is
that, unless the action described below is taken, half of
currently active grassroots NGOs may cease working during 1997.
(...)

Yet, part of the USAID development strategy is sustainability,
the practice of ensuring that after a few years of assistance,
other mechanisms are set in place to continue the activity when
USAID removes itself. For example, at least one of these six
programs guaranteed in its 1992 proposal to USAID that by the
time of this writing a local group would be administering its
project and that the American side would find private foundation
support for the continuation of the project. Because it was
realizable and potentially very effective, such a strategy is to
be commended as the embodiment of the sustainability approach.
Unfortunately, USAID has failed in respect to sustainability;
not only did this US organization never even try to turn over
its operations to a local group or secure private foundation
support, USAID apparently never even asked why. <a name=L10008></a><a href=#L10009>So</a> easily
discarded is sustainability in practice, it is almost certain
that this organization's current US staff in Central Asia is not
even aware of this central provision of the proposal.

Generally in USAID's Central Asia, the numerous initially
proposed options for sustainability have not been pursued; it is
fairer to say that they have been ignored. Private foundations
have not been coaxed into the region, local governments have not
been convinced to provide direct support to grassroots NGOs, and
local foundations have not been developed. Similarly,
legislation encouraging philanthropic giving and clarifying
taxation issues has not been a focus of the funding of legal
reform projects. The unfortunate fact is that "sustainability"
is to the professional US development community what "family
values" is to the political community, something which clearly
demands verbal affirmation but is unlikely to play a significant
role once the election is over or the contract is signed.
Moreover, it is difficult to imagine how the professional
development community would see its interests furthered by
sustainability.

Nevertheless, the survival and sustainability of Central Asian
NGOs is of undisputed importance. If NGOs disappear, <a name=L10009></a><a href=#L10010>so</a> will
many of the forces currently facilitating democratic and market
reforms. A democratic and open Central Asia offers global
advantages such as natural resources, a uniquely friendly
cultural bridge between Islam and Christianity, Europe and Asia,
and, as is becoming, sadly, increasingly important, a means of
containing an undemocratic Russia. The opinion of the US
government, European states, the World Bank, and virtually every
other country and institution active in Central Asia is that
NGOs are the most promising and effective democratic
institutions in Central Asia and the most trustworthy and
progressive possible partners in the region.

Further, NGOs in Central Asia are something of an unexpected
surprise. Although the Central Asian countries have been
independent for only four years, already the scope of their NGO
sector (I estimate roughly 2000 grassroots NGOs in the region)
dwarfs that of many South American and African, as well as all
Islamic, countries. Moreover, the percentage of social action
NGOs is many times higher than normal for developing countries.
Still more striking, in Central Asia, the average NGO employee
is a college graduate (often with a graduate degree) and speaks
several languages. The most active NGOs also efficiently use and
own computers, e-mail, and other modern tools at levels
surpassing virtually all governmental agencies. Further, project
costs in the region are a fraction of what similar programs
would cost in other countries. Thus, against the background of
development failures throughout the world, currently, Central
Asia shines. In this regard, Central Asia is an oasis of
exciting possibility in Asia. However, democracy in Central Asia
faces a variety of threats, including increasingly authoritarian
national governmental leaders, ethnic strife (there are
approximately 100 distinct ethnic groups in the region), threats
to secular governance, and outright war. (...)The conflict in
Tajikistan, in which Russia is heavily involved, has claimed the
lives of up to 200,000 Tajikistanis and is not expected to end
soon.

Because USAID is cutting back, because Europe is focused on
Europe itself, and because Central Asia is <a name=L10010></a><a href=#L10011>so</a> poorly understood,
by the end of this year, NGOs will have no major sources of
funding. Therefore, it is crucial that US private foundations
expand into Central Asia. Although USAID assistance has been
invaluable, private foundations are also needed to improve the
quality of development work in the region. For example, actual
grants may comprise only 25% of USAID program budgets for NGO
grant programs. What the NGO sector needs most is the kind of
sensitive and effective (and economically efficient) leadership
and program design that only creative local specialists can
provide, and, apparently, only US private foundations are in a
position to support. Maintaining current levels of NGO
assistance in the region requires a total investment of only
roughly $2 million in grants per year, a fraction of what is
currently being spent by the US government in Central Asia and
only .02% of total annual US private foundation philanthropic
expenditures. (...)

"Geopolitics" - Activities of International Donors in Central
Asia

by Eric Sievers - Over the past (...) months a number of
unrelated events have transpired. At the end of October in
Istanbul, in the five star Chinar Hotel, the International
Secretariat for Protection of the Nature of the Black Sea and
Central Asian Region, a project of the Turkish Fund for Nature
Protection (Turkye Sevre Vakfi), met for the third time. As for
the first two meetings, financial support was provided by
Japan's Sasakav Foundation and the participant list was
unilaterally determined by the Turkish organizers.
Interestingly, with each meeting the number of participants
changes. Those that are willing to sign any document put in
front of them are encouraged to return, while others go absent.
Furthermore, for some reason, Tajikistan and Armenia and other
countries "not associated with the region in which the
Secretariat is interested" went unrepresented, while Azerbaijan
(which is neither part of Central Asia nor near the Black Sea)
was invited. The founding mission of this secretariat was (...)
to gather information about the environmental conditions in the
participants' countries and then, in the name of an established
NGO, carry this information to the international community.
Rather, they appear to be involved in some uncertain politics,
not focused on any apparent work, and opportunistically taking
advantage of Central Asia for financial gain.

Similarly, a large group of Russian biologists recently received
a grant to conduct research on the biodiversity of Central Asia.
These scientists are both capable biologists and good people,
but (...) they are not inviting local scientists (save in
EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, and only then only to collect data
and nothing more) to work with them. While their funds were
issued in the name of international cooperation and to foster
international partnerships, the partnerships that are being
fostered in this study of Central Asia's biodiversity are almost
exclusively Russia-France, Russia-Germany, Russia-USA ...

Also, recently, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) has become
more active in Central Asia. A second biodiversity preservation
conference was recently held (this time on forest ecosystems).
They also received a grant with the KazEcoSys Fund from ISAR for
a conference about the introduction of new IUCN criteria for the
protection of endangered species in the region. The problem with
this project is that the director from the IUCN side, a Dr.
Parakatil, prefers to build his operations on bureaucratic
foundations and views NGO activists as little more than static
that interferes with his plans. Viewing NGOs not as partners but
as beneath oneself is a strange position for an international
NGO to assume, and this attitude damages the quality of IUCN's
work in the region.

In the international headquarters of the World Wildlife Fund in
Switzerland, it was decided that WWF Pakistan's coordinating
role in Central Asia (for the past three years, they have done
absolutely nothing except make promises) will be transferred to
the Russian Program Office. Of course, as usual, no one asked
the Central Asians what they thought about this change. The
Russian office put together a list of coordinators, again not
bothering to wonder whom the Central Asians would like to see on
this list. (...) In the middle of November (...) during the
Eighth International Snow Leopard Conservation Symposium in
Islamabad, Pakistan, all three players in this venture came
together: WWF Pakistan, the WWF Program Office in Russia, and
the Central Asian NGO biodiversity scientists. It was
interesting to watch how the two wings of WWF vied for the
attentions of the Central Asians, and impossible to count the
number of promises made. The Pakistanis began to voice concerns
about why all these Russians and Germans were trying to get
their fingers into "their" region, and the Russians spoke about
the need to prevent the destruction of the great unified culture
and institutions produced while the area was all still part of
the USSR ...

But what, after all, about the Central Asians? Are they just
enshrouded in their own dreams waiting for someone to come solve
their problems? In late November, at the Cheetah 95 conference
in Dashkhovuz, Turkmenistan representatives from Kazakstan,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and the United States
gathered to discuss Central Asia's problems. The result was the
formation of the International Central Asian Biodiversity
Institute. This institution, it is hoped, will be able to
coordinate local scientists (governmental and non-governmental)
and biodiversity work in order to provide an NGO structure
capable of communicating effectively with the international
community. (...) The first tasks of this new organization
involve establishing a data base, information distribution
structure, and funding strategy. Biostan is open to working with
governmental, academic, and nongovernmental organizations, as
well as with private individuals. (...) A Coordinating Committee
of eight people now exists, consisting of representatives of
each Central Asian republic and one representative from the
United States. The Executive Director is Oleg Tsaruk from
Uzbekistan, and a follow-up conference is tentatively planned
for the fall of 1997 in Karaganda, Kazakstan.

Desertification - The Asian  R I O D  Conference

by Oleg Tsaruk, Ecolog - Desertification (the degradation of
natural and anthropogenic ecosystems in arid and semi-arid
zones) is one of the most serious problems in the world today.
More than 100 countries are affected or threatened by
desertification. The most well-known example of desert
encroachment is in the Sahel countries; this desertification has
claimed millions of human lives. The Convention to Combat
Desertification (CCD) was developed to address problems related
to desertification and pioneer strategies for preventing
desertification.

The idea for this convention was born in 1992 at the Rio
Conference; the convention itself was presented on June 17, 1994
in Paris. Since then, 115 countries have become signatories and
twenty have ratified the document. Ninety days after fifty
countries have ratified the convention (expected to be in 1997),
it comes into force. All of the Central Asian countries have
signed this convention, and at least Kazakstan and Uzbekistan
have also ratified it. It is important to note that this
convention is one of the first international agreements which
demands that participant states involve NGOs in the realization
of the convention's efforts. Moreover, the Secretariat of the
CCD includes an NGO Liaison; at present, this post is filled by
Ms. Sylvia Jampies (sjampies.incd@unep.ch).

Translated from the French "Reseau International d'ONG sur la
Desertification," RIOD is the International NGO Coalition
Against Desertification. At the end of January in Islamabad,
Pakistan, the first Asian RIOD Conference was held. Analogous
conferences have already been held in Africa and Europe, and
North and South American conferences are planned for the near
future.

Central Asia was represented by three people from Tashkent
(Uzbekistan), two from Tajikistan, and one from Kazakstan.
Unfortunately, for various reasons, expected participants from
Turkmenistan and Nukus (Karakalpakistan, Uzbekistan) did not
arrive, and Kyrgyzstan did not react to invitations. Once again,
the Central Asian region showed its lack of organization and its
lack of understanding of the importance of direct international
contacts and participation. In addition, representatives from
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Mongolia, Nepal,
Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Japan, and Pakistan were
in attendance. The President of Pakistan opened the conference
and pledged his full support for RIOD's work, a display of
governmental interest and recognition that we Central Asian's
could only react to with pleased and unaccustomed astonishment.

One result of the conference which was very important to us was
the recognition of the five republics of Central Asia as an
independent sub-region. Temporarily, the International
Biodiversity Institute (BIOSTAN) will represent RIOD in Central
Asia. For comparison, other recognized sub-regions were
Southeast Asia, Southern Asia, and Western Asia. Also, for the
present time, Turkey and Mongolia will be incorporated into the
Central Asian working group. The Central Asian group will also
focus its attention on the desertification problems of southern
Siberia. Interestingly, Russian environmental bureaucrats have
ignored CCD and RIOD, claiming that Russia does not have
desertification problems! One of our immediate goals is drawing
attention to this oversight by Russia. We are looking for
international contacts to facilitate this effort.

The Central Asian group is now working to inform NGOs in Central
Asia about RIOD and develop a regional coalition of NGOs. We
hope that this coalition will develop in the next three months
into a cogent structure capable of effectively representing
Central Asia and furthering the CCD. Any assistance of any kind
will be appreciated.

Bayer in Kazakstan

The metallurgical plant H. C. Starck GmbH (Ltd.), a full
subsidiary of the BAYER group located in the East German city of
Goslar, exports waste and scrap metal containing molybdenum to
Stepnogorsk, Kazakstan, ostensibly for recycling. The firm
alleges that conditions there are excellent, even "better than
in Germany." But, environmentalists associated with Greenpeace
found an atomic ruin with dumped heaps of waste. A lot of the
buildings in the factory area are in very bad condition, and the
waste management of the factory is dramatically neglected.
Scattered on and around the actual factory site are large heaps
of varicolored wastes which are spread around by the wind. Here,
uranium and other rare metals are being leached from ore with
the help of sulfuric acid. The uranium output is very high. The
COORDINATION AGAINST BAYER-DANGERS demands an immediate export
freeze of toxic waste to Kazakstan, an extensive environmental
assessment and responsible disposal of these pollutants at the
expense of the BAYER group.

ILYE-ALATAUSKY NATIONAL PARK 

by Kiril Zakhvatkin, Green Salvation - By decree of the
government of the Republic of Kazakstan, the Ilye-Alatausky
National Nature Park has been formed. With an area of 164,500
hectares (640 square miles) and a length of 150 kilometers,
Ilye-Alatau encompasses a large mountain forest zone of the
Zailisky Alatau Mountain Range, itself a section of the immense
Tien-Shan Mountain Range. The new park boasts unique landscapes,
natural formations, cultural monuments, and diverse plant and
animal life. A part of the park consists of high mountains and
glaciers with abrupt cliffs. The park's highest point, Peak
Talgar, is 4974 meters (16,319 feet). (...)

However, the value of the formation of this national park
extends far beyond the borders of general ecology and nature
protection. The park embraces many of the life-giving sources
that enable the existence of the largest social-economic
conglomeration in the country, the 1.5 million inhabitant
metropolis of Almaty. Here in the Zailisky Alatau, moisture
collects and is regulated, supplying a steady stream to the
city. Furthermore, the park may facilitate the resolution of
some of the most serious social and economic problems of Almaty.
(...)

Because of its size and proximity (less than a half hour drive)
to a national capital with rapidly westernizing service and
transportation facilities, the unique natural beauty of this
park presents an unusual combination of cultural (Silk Road and
Central Asia) and environmental (immense mountains and snow
leopard) attractions. Nevertheless, because of the difficult
economic transitional conditions of this young sovereign state,
Ilye-Alatau is being closely watched by the government which
expects the park to redeem its economic potential quickly.
Therefore, this exceptionally wise and far-sighted step toward
sustainable development needs to be recognized by the world
community and confirmed by adventure tourists. [Note by Eric
Sievers: The Press Release of the United States Information
Agency in Almaty on April 15 credits Green Salvation and VOCA
for their technical work in helping to push the park proposal
through. The Kazakstan State Forest Committee will be entrusted
with management of Ilye Alatau. The press release also noted
that the next cooperative project between VOCA and Green
Salvation may be an effort to have the Zailisky Alatau listed as
a UN World Heritage site.]

Welcome to our Safari! 

by S. Malostvolov - On December 5, 1995, the government of the
Republic of Kazakstan adopted Decree 1667, "About conducting on
the territory of Altyn-Emil National Park a scientific
experiment to study the possibility of a limited taking of Red
Book animals. This idea came from none other than the primary
agency for nature protection in the republic, the Ministry of
Ecology and Bioresources. Support for this idea, and legal
assistance, came from the Ministry of Justice and the National
Academy of Sciences.

The guinea pig in this round of experiments is the endangered
djeiran. Before, it was the muflon and arkhar; a plan was
adopted last year to shoot 124 of these animals between 1995-97
for scientific research. Under this new plan, in the next two
years foreign hunters will be allowed to shoot 20 djeiran each
year. The justification for this hunt, as always, is sciencethe
study of biological, morphological, and other characteristics.
This scientific research will occur despite the fact that the
djeiran is a very well-studied animal already. Simultaneously,
as paradoxical as it may seem, the scientists will also study
the effects of shooting on the population of an endangered
species. Even more distressing, the proceeds of these animals
(meat?) from these hunts will be given to the regional
authorities and are supposed to be used to facilitate flora and
fauna protection in regional nature reserves.

Rocket and Space Launches in Kazakstan

Green Women Information Agency - Recently, astronauts have been
seizing headlines again and re-emerging as popular heroes. In
Kazakstan, newspapers, radios, and other media are actively
celebrating these hometown heroes. However, there is little talk
of the actual cost of these space flight achievements and their
effects on the nature and people of Kazakstan. This topic being
<a name=L10011></a><a href=#L10012>so</a> rarely addressed, it is significant that the newspaper Aziya
recently carried a story about this subject, a story informed by
data from Kazakstan's Ministry of Ecology and Bioresources.
Valery Yakovlev, who has studied the issue of the factories of
the military industrial complex and their environmental effects
on their local regions has disturbing news. He claims that the
situation in Djezkazgan Region amounts to an environmental
disaster of global impact, more serious even than the more well
known Aral Sea and Semipalatinsk disasters combined. Consider
that rocket fuel has been sprayed from the Pacific to the
Atlantic. Coming back to the specific problems of Kazakstan, it
is fairly certain that roughly 77 million hectares have been
polluted, one million lives affected, and between two and four
trillion dollars of damage been inflicted on the environment.
The major sources of this pollution are two forty year old
installations in the region, the Baikenour Space Launch Facility
and the Saryshagan Rocket Facility. Almost half of Djezkazgan
Region, 16 million hectares, has been set aside for the
operations of these facilities. Commitments to Russia regarding
these and other installations ensure that they will continue to
operate for at least another decade. Pollution related to
launchings, landings, and the separation of stages will continue
to be a major pollution concern; there were 44 launchings last
year alone. 20 commercial Proton Rocket launches have been
scheduled to occur in what remains of this century. The research
module that just this week docked with Mir was launched from
Baikenour. The toxic and even mutagenic effects of many of the
materials and chemicals used at these facilities and in these
rockets provides well-founded reason to be concerned. Research
has begun to show that some districts are virtually coated in
this pollution and that winds and other natural processes are
transporting these chemicals increasingly into major bodies of
water, as well as ground water. The Djezkazgan Regional
Administration has made repeated appeals to the national
government to address this situation, emphasizing that there is
a proven scientific connection between Baikenour's activities
and morbidity (especially cancers and infant mortality) in the
region. Complicating this situation, 14 of Kazakstan's 19
regions are polluted by military industrial plants or
installations on their territories. There is currently no action
plan or even coordinated research being implemented to address
this issue, much less an organized medical or humanitarian
response being organized to assist those who are afflicted.

Turkmenistan
SILENCE IS NOT CONSENT 

by Bairam Allabaev - In independent (and now even neutral)
Turkmenistan, it is not safe to voice one's discontent with the
present order and the incompetence of the bureaucrats and
employees of the law enforcement agencies. In this former Soviet
republic, where the personality cult has attained its most
colorful incarnation with regard to President Saparmurat
Niyazov, those who are unhappy and those who hold divergent
viewpoints can easily be sent to a psychiatric hospital, be
announced criminal, or be declaimed with a variety of shameful
labels. All of the participants of last year's youth uprising in
the streets of Ashgabad found themselves detained and small
packages of narcotics stuck into their pockets. Such narcotics
possessions proved sufficient grounds for serious indictments
and detentions. Moreover, this mass demonstration was distorted
by the government-controlled media as nothing more than "an act
of hooliganistic drug addicts and alcoholics." These reports
only drew snickers from a population perfectly able to read
between the lines. (...) A resident of Dashkhovuz also recently
paid for his activity and openness. Khudaishukur Kalandarov, an
executive in a construction firm, could not remain silent any
longer in the face of Turkmenistan's lawlessness. He literally
buried the President's and the Regional Attorney's offices in
telegrams documenting the illegality of methods used with regard
to a fellow citizen, Tursun Matyazov, charged with felonies. He
waited for explanations in vain. They threw him into a holding
cell and charged him with committing two felonies, slander and
interfering with the work of a law enforcement agency. Even the
Constitution of Turkmenistan, which Kalandarov cited in his own
defense in the courtroom, was ignored by the judge. It could not
have been otherwise. After all, such important figures as
Regional Attorney Ataev and Regional Governor Motaev were
personally interested in the outcome of the trial against the
indefatigable and awkward Kalandarov. Kalandarov's endless
telegrams to Ashgabad had stuck very painfully in the throats of
these officials. Having pronounced the guilt of Kalandarov and
having sentenced him to 30 months in jail, the court freed him
on the authority of a presidential amnesty decree. With their
conviction, the regional officials achieved their goal, they
officially made an honest and principled man a recognized felon.
No one will listen to or respect a recognized felon. Many
residents of Dashkhovuz who know Kalandarov and what happened to
him were only reaffirmed in their belief that there is no
justice in Turkmenistan; unless you want your back broken, be
quiet. However, silence is not necessarily a sign of consent ...

SAVING THE LEOPARD - SYMBOL OF TURKMENISTAN'S MOUNTAINS

by Victor Lukarevsky, Syunt Khasardagsky Nature Reserve - In
terms of numbers of large predator species, Turkmenistan
probably ranks first among Central Asian countries. Even in the
not-so-distant past, in the 1950s, there were eight species of
large predators, including two brown bear subspecies and two
lynx subspecies. In an instant, two species and two subspecies
disappeared; the Turan tiger, Asian cheetah, Syrian brown bear,
and an absolutely unstudied lynx are now extinct. Of the species
that remain, the leopard is the most endangered; it could also
become extinct by the next decade. Only five years ago, the
leopard population in Turkmenistan numbered between 130-150
individuals and seemed relatively stable and hopeful. Leopards
inhabited all the mountain ranges of the country, and in each
range there were several communities of leopards which
contributed to the stability of the entire population. However,
the social and economic changes in Turkmenistan negatively
effected every part of the leopard's habitat, especially in the
various parks and reserves of the country. Since the leopard is
at the top of the food chain in its habitat, these changes had
an immediate affect on the population. At the present time, the
Asian leopard may be the most endangered large cat in the world.
Our research over the past two years has shown that in many
areas, even in protected areas, leopard has either disappeared
entirely (as in the Kugitang-tau Mountains) or has had its
population cut roughly in half (as in the Syunt Khasardagsky
Nature Reserve). (...) From time immemorial, the leopard has
lived with man in the south of Turkmenistan, and conflicts
between the two have been infrequent, for the most part only
occurring during hunts for common, indeed swarming, ungulate
prey. Yet, in the past five years the mountains, even in the
areas of protected reserves, have become nearly devoid of this
prey. During the 1980s, some preserved areas had literally
hundreds of thousands of mountain goats and boars; now there may
be a few dozen left. Under these conditions, the leopard is
forced to descend outside the boundaries of his usual mountain
habitat and hunt domestic animals. Sadly, these rogue leopards
are, sooner or later, killed by bullets or baited poisonous
traps shot. (...) Even in the 1984-1985 season, the number of
leopards in the central part of the Syunt Khasardagsky Nature
Reserve was no more than three adults and one or two young, who,
as in the present day, wandered far outside the boundaries of
the reserve during their hunts since the population of mountain
sheep barely reached 100 individuals and the population of boars
barely reached 150 individuals. Remains of leopard meals
contained most evidence of boars, porcupine, and domestic
animals. Only in 20% of the finds was there evidence of mountain
sheep. However, within five years the situation changed for the
better. The leopard population increased to four adults and
three or four young, and attacks on domestic livestock almost
completely ceased. Instead, the major sources of food were
mountain sheep and boars, whose populations had increased to
approximately 250-270 and 170-200 individuals respectively.
Thus, as prey populations increased, <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> did the leopard
population. This correlation is explained by the fact that the
leopard preys upon sick, injured, old, young, or otherwise unfit
individuals. (...) Because of unregulated poaching in protected
lands, over the past five years, ungulate populations in the
Syunt Khasardagsky Mountain Range have plummeted to critical
lows and probably do not exceed more than a few dozen
individuals. Accordingly, leopard populations dropped from seven
to eight individuals in 1990-91 to three to four individuals
now. Wild prey now constitutes less than 25% of the leopards'
diet, and the leopard is again forced to wander far from the
nature reserve's boundaries in search of prey. Sometimes,
however, it is also able to find prey within the reserve's
boundaries as cattle grazing is, in the new regime, an allowed
use of the nature reserve's resources. It is obvious, that the
leopard is not guilty for its attacks on domesticated animals.
Rather, it is man's fault, an obvious fact if we can move
ourselves far enough to accept that the leopard also has a right
to life. Moreover, as public policy, the leopard is not a
significant threat, and shepherds are in actuality harming
themselves when they shoot leopards. In the areas where hunger
or guns extirpate the leopard, the wolf appears, a predator that
poses a much more salient threat to domestic animals. And if it
were possible to also extirpate the wolf, since nature does not
approve of empty niches, it is likely that feral dogs would
appear, only increasing the problem as these animals are
exclusively reliant on domestic prey and much more comfortable
around settlements. World practice is showing the need for
developed and interconnected systems of nature reserves and
hunting reserves. Ironically, Turkmenistan was a leader in
nature conservation in the 1980s; it's park system of nature
reserves was a model not only for the Soviet Union, but also for
the rest of the world. However, it's system of hunting reserves
was not as developed. This disparity was addressed a few years
ago in a unique way by the Ministry of Nature Use through the
efforts of Oraz Geldiev, an infamous former deputy minister.
Geldiev's solution was to turn nature reserves into hunting
areas, inviting rich foreigners to the country to pay for hunts
on endangered animals. His slogan, "the only science I need is
the one which pays," buried not only conservation biology, but
also the nature reserves themselves, sending nature protection
back a half century in Turkmenistan. While the nature reserves
operated, they offered total protection, a mandate respected not
only by the scientific community, but also by the local
populations. The appearance of such hunts only inspired locals
to take up arms themselves and initiated an explosions of
poaching that decimated the leopard's prey populations. 

This work was conducted with financial support from the John D.
and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.

THE DEGRADATION OF THE CHELEKEN PENINSULA 

by Timur Berkeliev, Ashgabad Ecological Club CATENA - The
Cheleken Peninsula (now actually an island connected to the
mainland only by a pontoon crossing) has suffered more than
other regions of Turkmenistan as a result of the rising waters
of the Caspian. The lower part of the town of Cheleken is
flooded, and the main road to Nebitdag, upon which residents
rely for trade an fuel, is threatened with destruction. All of
this exacerbates the difficult environmental conditions caused
by large amounts of particulate pollution (bitumen and heavy
metals) from a nearby technical carbon factory. Until the
beginning of industrialization in the region, the Cheleken area
contained natural springs of mineral water and bitumen, traces
of which are clearly manifested in khir sand (native bitumen
cemented sands), ozokerite residues sulfide carbonates, mineral
deposits, and radium bearing anomalies. Since the 1930s, iodine
has been captured from these underground pools at such a rate
that in the 1960s the natural springs disappeared. The
concentrations of elements in the local mineral water varies,
with cadmium, tin, and silver reaching up to 1 mg/l, zinc, lead,
and copper reaching up to 10 mg/l, and iron, strontium, barium,
iodine, and bromine reaching up to 100 mg/l. At one time, the
production of all the iodine-bromine springs reached nearly
40,000 cubic meters/day. At the present time, the actual number
is much lower because of outdated and worn-out equipment for
which spare parts cannot be found. Because of all this, for
natural and anthropogenic reasons, there are constant increases
in the concentrations of toxic heavy metals such as radium,
cadmium, and thallium, and valuable metals such as lithium,
rubidium, and strontium. To illustrate this phenomenon with some
specific examples, springs G-39 and E-188 exhibit
characteristically high deposits of radiobarite. Spring G-39,
drilled in 1961 to a depth of 1007 meters will be filled with
barites within three years. Even by 1966, the pumping pipes had
become filled with several tens of thousands of tons of barites,
which contained three times the amount of radium typical during
such operations. The total radiation carried to the surface is
estimated at approximately ten million bekkerels. In 1935, Dr.
Scherbakov estimated the daily incidental production of radium
from the iodine springs to be roughly 1.5 mg. Of course, the
present daily output is much higher. Nevertheless, we can use
this figure as a minimum estimate and calculate that over the
past 60 years, 36.5 grams of radium have been brought to the
surface, the equivalent of 1.35 trillion bekkerels. Moreover,
the activated coal used in the filtering process absorbs a
significant quantity of radium. At the same time, the question
of how and where to store waste materials has not been resolved.
After the powdered coal has dried, it is usually simply carried
away by the wind. The effect is easily viewed by radioactive
mapping, and the most disturbing consequences are viewed near
the territory of the carbon factory and the settlements of
Sary-Kai. Of course, other elements can also be trapped within
this coal, most notably very high concentrations of thallium.
Another serious environmental and health problem resulting from
the creation of radioactive coal is the production of radon as
radium decays. Technogenic processes are currently strongly
influencing earlier formed concentrations of rare elements.
Thus, sulfide minerals at the surface are exposed to oxidation
and the resulting compounds are often spread by wind causing
health hazards as these chemicals mix into the soil and water
supply. Moreover, no one has yet studied the concentrations of
thallium and similar elements in the dust around Cheleken. Thus,
the mineral waters of Cheleken which have been used as sources
of iodine and bromine, and could in the future be used to
produce other valuable elements, are a serious environmental
problem because of several heavy metals. More quantitative
research must be done to further elucidate the problem. It does
not seem possible to suggest closing down the iodine-bromine
factory since it is one of only three industrial sources of
income for the town. The other two are the technical carbon
factory and oil refinery (which is also far from being innocent
in the environmental sense). The closing of any one of these
enterprises would lead to significant unemployment and a danger
to the further existence of the town and nearby settlements.
Further, at the present time, it also does not appear to be
feasible to talk about remediation of the local soils and
restoration of local biodiversity. One interesting
characteristic of life on Cheleken is that the usual trophic
relationship between people and the land does not exist. The
usual soil-plant-animal-man chain is inapplicable since all the
drinking water and almost all food products (except fish and
some meat) are imported to Cheleken. Therefore, of primary
importance is cataloguing the transport venues of solid and
liquid wastes and preventing their concentration near
residential areas. Later, it will be necessary to do risk
assessments of these industrial wastes and determine
possibilities for recycling or containment. Concurrently, it
will be necessary to seek alternative technologies capable of
minimizing environmental damage.

THE PAMIR ECOCENTER

The Pamir EcoCenter is a nongovernmental nonprofit private
voluntary organization formed to preserve human habitat, wild
nature, landscapes, and also to disseminate environmental
education to local people. The Pamir EcoCenter was registered in
1994 through the Executive Committee of the Gorno-Badakhshan
Region of Tajikistan.

The current projects of the EcoCenter include conducting a
biological inventory of the Gunt Valley, in cooperation with
Khorog University, and the running of an active environmental
education center, partially funded through a grant from
ISAR/USAID. This educational center is located in the village of
Djelondy at an altitude of 3600 meters, 125 kilometers from
Khorog, and offers youth, university, and adult education
classes. The site was chosen because it is a striking example of
a high altitude ecosystem containing typical flora and fauna as
well as many thermal springs.

TAJIKISTAN NGO/GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE 

by Yuri Skochilov and Muazama Burkhanova, Foundation in Support
of Citizen Initiatives - On March 5 and 6 in Dushanbe, under the
auspices of the Foundation in Support of Citizen Initiatives, a
unique seminar was held: Solving Environmental Problems Through
NGO/Government Cooperation. Over 40 Tajikistan NGOs and foreign
organizations were represented at this seminar, as well as
representatives of the government and parliament. (...) In order
to more effectively realize social-environmental projects, we
intend to form an Independent Citizen Environmental Council
consisting of representatives of environmental NGOs. The
composition of this council was proposed and confirmed at a
general meeting of NGOs on March 14, 1996. (...) List of members
of the Independent Citizen Environmental Council is to develop
an action plan for the primary areas of environmental policy:

O. Aknazarov of the Pamir EcoCenter (Khorog)

O. Baratov of the Geological Society (Dushanbe)

M. Burkhanova of the Foundation in Support of Citizen
Initiatives (Dushanbe)

S. Blagoveschenskaya of the Small Academy of Sciences (Dushanbe)

R. Djabarov of the Law Department of Tajikistan State University
(Dushanbe)

K. Dadabaev of the Foundation in Support of Citizen Initiatives
(Dushanbe)

A. Rakhmonberdyev of the Foundation in Support of Citizen
Initiatives (Dushanbe)

Y. Skochilov of the Youth EcoCenter (Dushanbe)

V. Savateev of the Scientific Pedagogical Society (Dushanbe)

Tairov, Chair of the Dushanbe City Council Environmental
Commission

Z. Usmanov of the Institute of Mathematics (Dushanbe). (...)

Kurzmeldungen Mittelasien:

The 5 December OMRI Daily Digest reported that seven Uzbekistan
newspapers have ceased publication and that the quantity of
radioactive waste accumulating in Kazakstan's uranium mining and
processing plants, 219 million tons, is reaching "alarming
proportions."

The 29 February OMRI Daily Digest reported that wolves are
threatening humans in northwestern Kazakstan and that "the
Kazakhstani government has set aside 3 million tenge ($46,000)
to organize special brigades of hunters and offer bounties to
deal with an increasing number of attacks on humans by a growing
wolf population." It also reported a biologist's estimate that
there are now 60,000 wolves in Kazakstan, an increase due to the
cessation of government bounties several years ago, and that in
Eastern Kazakstan, a bounty for wolf is equal to $74.

Dushanbe's parks are being destroyed. Despite a spring
presidential decree, citizens are continuing to cut trees in the
city parks. 25,000 saplings were planted in March 1995, most of
which are now gone. 20% of the main park is now cleared of
vegetation.

The NGO Information Center, in partnership with Save the
Children United States, and with financial assistance from
Counterpart Consortium, has opened an NGO Resource Center in
Dushanbe.

Poaching continues in the Pamirs. This year, authorities
detained smugglers attempting to export 10 Snow Leopard pelts.
These skins sell for $1000 on the local Dushanbe market and from
$10,000 to $25,000 on the world market. However, in the remote
Pamirs, such a pelt or a rack of Marco Polo sheep horns can be
traded for a pair of durable military boots. The official ban on
such exports to Western countries and the active measures of
local law enforcement agencies have led to falling prices on the
local black market for Snow Leopard, Tien-Shan bear, and other
rare species.

The Eighth International Snow Leopard Conservation Symposium was
held in the middle of November in Islamabad, Pakistan and
contained a special working session on the biodiversity of
Central Asia. Snow leopard habitat countries such as
Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, Kazakstan, Mongolia, Nepal,
Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan were in attendance,
as well as representatives from the United States, Canada,
Turkmenistan, World Wildlife Federation, and the World
Conservation Union. Representatives from Central Asian NGOs
participated in both the snow leopard and biodiversity
discussions thanks to a grant from ISAR to the International
Snow Leopard Trust (USA) and Ecolog (Uzbekistan). Unfortunately,
due to unforeseeable circumstances, NGO representatives from
Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan could not attend. (...) There was one
particularly interesting moment at the symposium. Several years
ago, WWF International gave WWF Pakistan responsibility for
addressing the problems of Central Asia. While WWF Pakistan
representatives visited the Central Asia republics a few times,
nothing at all ever came of it. Thus, recently the coordinating
role was shifted to the Russian Program Office of WWF. Having
lost the formal right to represent WWF in the Central Asian
republics, our southern neighbors finally opened their eyes and
began to open up real communications with us. (...) (by Oleg

Conference Announcement: On June 1-2, the Union in Defense of
the Aral Sea and Amu Darya and the Netherlands Foundation NOVIB
will sponsor the Second Central Asian NGO conference in
Tashkent. This conference was originally scheduled for late May
and only recently rescheduled. The goal of the organizers is to
facilitate the development of a region-wide NGO coalition. In
contrast to the first conference, held 10-12 November in Nukus
with the goal of acquainting NGOs with each other, the Tashkent
conference anticipates more concrete action. NOVIB hopes that
each of the invited organizations will dedicate itself to
practical results. This dedication should be demonstrated
through both past work, as well as through the presentation of
future projects, in English, to be considered for financial
support from NOVIB. NOVIB plans to provide financial support for
projects addressing ecology, environmental education, health,
water management, women's issues, and technology. The maximum
size of a grant will be $3000-$4000.

MOLDOVA

State Ecological Inspection: Often From Misfortune Blessings Flow

According to the data given in the report of the State
Ecological Inspection by I. Buchinsky, Director, it could be
said that in the republic there was an invisible opposition in
"three spheres" (in the air, on the land and in the water)
between nature defenders and various economic agents who make
harm to nature by their activities. A considerable lowering of
the atmosphere pollution level belongs to the cheerful figures
mentioned at the 1995 report meeting of the Board of the State
Department for the Environmental Protection and Natural
Resources. Last year the general index of harmful particles
found in the air was reduced to 1.5 tons less than the previous
year's index, however, here it is appropriate to recall a folk
proverb: often from misfortune blessings flow. Regretfully, the
qualitative improvement of the atmospheric conditions could not
be explained by more careful attitude towards nature but by a
forced closing of the majority of the harmful productions caused
by economic confusions. Undoubtedly, liquidation of nearly 50
per cent of small boilerhouses or their remodeling to natural
gas stations has played a certain positive role in the whole
situation. Along with that, as it was mentioned in the report,
the index of sulphatanhydride presence in the air is kept at the
same level. It is connected with the use of high rate sulphur
fuel. Industrial wastes to be buried in the ground also present
a difficult problem to solve. Nearly 11 million tons of such
wastes were produced last year, 18.5 thousand of which are
considered to be toxic, while 3.5 thousand are extra-toxic. A
hopeful sign is that the use of pesticides was considerably
reduced for the last five years. The 1995 index is thrice less
than the one five years ago: 5.1 thousand tons against 14.5
thousand tons in 1990, though it also has negative impact on
soil. Besides the ever-application of chemicals the soil is also
subjected to other troubles. Particularly, as before,
considerable areas of fertile soil are excluded from the
turnover only because they are either used in insignificant
purposes or not used at all, because of landslides and wind
erosion. Various commercial groups, purchasing plots of land,
which are actually agricultural farm properties, do not care for
preservation of the fertile stratum of soil destroying it
instead of providing its disposal to some other place. The main
source of landslides and wind erosion is mass destruction of
forests and protective forest zones. The woods of Vulcanesti
region, which have suffered most of all from such disasters
during the current ten years, still are subjected to regular
tree felling. 29 hectares of forests were cut illegally in the
village of Brinza, despite it being the property of the local
authority, while 12 hectares of forest belonging to the local
agrofarm "Moldova" were cut in the village of Slobozeia Mare. As
to the water (...) the river Prut has suffered most of all. On
August 28, a heavy pollution of the river's section took place
in the confluence area of its tributary Bahlui as a result of an
accident during the purification works in the city of Yasi
(Roumania). The economic agents of the village of Yargara, in
Leovo region, added negative impacts to the situation when there
was a huge fuel leakage from containers of the local elevator
with oil escaping into the river. Last year 8,213 enterprises
and organizations influencing the environment were checked for
ecological standards by the State Ecological Inspection of
Moldova - an institution realizing special control over
environmental conditions. The inspectors have made 5,049
protocols, on the basis of which the economic agents were
subjected to sanctions. 112 cases were passed on to the
Ecological Prosecutor's office for investigation, while 720
cases of ecological legislation infringement were considered by
public courts and 14 cases by arbitration.

WHAT IS IN A GLASS OF WATER?

by Valentina Malikova, IEA "ALTAIR" - According to the
calculations of the international experts more than 60 per cent
of human diseases are connected with bad water quality. (...)
Meanwhile, in the Republic of Moldova there are more than 39.5
per cent of central water supply sources which do not meet the
requirements of (...) "Drinking water". Then, perhaps, wells and
springs are less dangerous? Unfortunately, the situation with
them is even more complicated, especially in the countryside. It
seems as if pure drinking water here is becoming an exceptional
rarity. As a matter of fact, now the main cause for drinking
water pollution in the countryside is private stock breeding.
Many villagers keep the animals in their back yards, without
paying much attention to waste utilization, namely manure and
sewer. Wastes saturating the yard's ground by themselves turn
into sulphates, nitrates and other organic pollutants. Then the
pollutants penetrate wells. Nothing of the kind could ever
happen if the owners would dispose their animals' wastes in the
fields, for agricultural lands fertilizing, promoting natural
nitrogen recycling. However, manure piles at the private back
yards continue to grow. Simultaneously the indices of drinking
water quality and those of villagers' health, especially the
health of children, are getting worse. The research testifies
that the children's sick rate level is 3-4 times higher in the
regions with the most polluted water sources. These children are
behind their peers in physical development, they get sick more
often and slower recover from illness. "The reasons for
children's and adults' poor health could not be, of course,
limited by the nitrate pollution of drinking water", - N.I.
Opopol, Professor of the State Medical University and First
Assistant General Director of the State Hygiene and Epidemiology
Scientific Center of Moldova, said. "Undoubtedly, the importance
of heredity should not be underestimated. Do not forget either
about bitter 'fruit' of intensive over-application of chemicals
in agriculture. I mean the statistics on liver cirrhosis, other
chronic diseases and, of course, the population death rate,
which was more than doubled in the last decade. It were village
residents, who are the leaders in the sad statistics.We have
worked out special recommendations on how to provide villagers
with pure drinking water and passed them on to the Ministry of
Public Health and the Government of Moldova. We believe that the
countryside populated areas need group water pipelines. The
project for their construction has been approved. The building
of such a pipeline has been started from the area of the town of
Soroki, but this new construction had to be frozen because of
the lack of means."

<a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>So</a>, did the whole story come to the end? But, where is the way
out? As scientists think, there is a way out. Firstly, one
should try and find subsidies for construction of modern group
water pipelines, evidently at the expense of local budgets.
Secondly, it is necessary to take care of drinking water quality
in order not to allow its further pollution. Who should take
this responsibility? Apparently the local authorities! It is in
their power to prosecute the environmental protection law
breakers. At their disposal also are regional centers of hygiene
and epidemiology, whose specialists could reveal safe wells and
springs in villages to be used instead of polluted ones. Lastly,
the industry produces water purification filters. Professor
Opopol informed us about inculcation of such appliances of
collective use in Moldova. They are able to purify 300 liters of
water daily, which is quite enough to meet the needs of a
village school, kindergarten or several families. The efficiency
of such collective filters has been proved during the tests in
Hincesti, Orhei and Straseni regions of Moldova. (...)

Forests in Moldova:

Valentina Malikova, IEA "ALTAIR" - (...) In former times Moldova
was famous for its marvellous kodry forests. Now it is among the
poorest of the European countries in woods. Today forests occupy
less than 400 hectares in the republic. As a result, there is
only 0.06 hectares of woods per capita. However, even this
scanty index will turn to be less if one does not take into
account plantings along railways and freeways. In this case the
woods area will make only 6 per cent of the regions territory,
which is simply dangerous. Furthermore, the forest fund is split
to more than 800 units with an area of 0.5 to 1.500 hectares,
which is far from being sufficient to provide wild animals with
normal life conditions. The State Forest Fund comprises 325
thousand hectares, while the remaining part of the woods belongs
to the municipalities and collective farms. The state fund is
relatively fine as far as it gets necessary care, but the woods
of the collective farms are exploited rudely-unwarranted,
tree-felling is very common here. The local authorities choose
to ignore this and even take part themselves in these ruinous
actions. Unfortunately, the Ecological Inspection cannot
counteract with well-equipped and armed law breakers. As a
result, the collective forest fund has lost 738.8 thousand cubic
metres of wood for the last five years. While the state forest
fund lost 10 thousand cubic metres. The present crisis, affected
the forest resources of Moldova, is conditioned to many reasons.
The most important of these are illegal tree felling,
ecologically incompetent natural resources use, ignoring their
natural regeneration, primarily of seeds. All these factors
taken together caused the changes in green huge tracts of
forest, <a name=L10003></a><a href=#L10004>so</a> that the main forest forming species- oak- occupy now
only 51 per cent of the state forest fund area (for comparison
in 1964 it was 64 per cent). In addition, some tree species, not
typical for this region, had been introduced in the republic.
Among them is white acacia, planted over a quarter of the forest
funds' area. White acacia has had a tragic lot. Its planting is
just perishing, simply drying up. By this time Moldova has a
weakend, badly regenerating forest, the existance of which is
under a serious threat of extinction. A deplorable condition of
woods, of course, had a negative effect on the state reserve
fund too. Presently, there are five reserves of an exceptionally
scientific character (the total area is 19,418 hectares).
However, their ecosystem's preservation appeares to be a
difficult task. To this end there is not any legislative basis,
which could account the new realia. The reserves are not
provided by a proper guard. The best highskilled specialists
leave their jobs, because of financial problems, while reserve
regieme breakers are becoming more numerous. Particularly, the
cases of poaching and herding of domestic cattle are becoming
more frequent along with the placing of trash heaps. (...)

STUDY AND PROTECTION OF BATS IN NOTHERN AND CENTRAL MOLDOVA

Andrey Vasilyev, Doctor of Biology, "Fauna" group Director -
Under this name the project, carried out by "Fauna" group
belonging to the Association of Young Ecologists of Moldova
"Campul Ecologic", has been closed on February 15, 1996. The
project was 85 per cent financed by the World Nature Association
(Maryland, USA). There have been carried out 16 expeditions to
study fauna of bats living in the caves of the republic, 32
lectures read to school students and mine workers, 5 articles
published in press and 3 scientific reports presented at the
conferences on temporary conditions and protection of these
animals. The hand-winged animals have wonderful abilities, such
as flying, ultra sound orientation in darkness and winter
hibernation. Bats bring much aid by eating lots of night
insects, including harmful ones. Of 18 species of the animals
living in our republic only 3 are quite common, the rest of them
are considered to be rare ones. All of them are protected by the
state, but no active measures on their real protection is being
taken. The "Fauna" group prepared a report "Bats' Contemporary
Condition in Moldova and Necessary Measures for Their
Protection", which is supposed to be presented to the State
Department for the Environmental Protection and Natural
Resources and Parliamentary Subcommission on Ecology. "Fauna"
group will continue the campaign on rare species of animals of
Moldova protection, including the hand-winged ones, during the
project realization "In the Search of Salamandra", financed by
ISAR Kiev Regional Office in 1996.

"Ich will gar nichts, nur mein Land.

Gib mir mein Land zurueck, wo ich meine Rentiere weiden, Wild
jagen und Fische fangen kann.

Gib mir mein Land, wo meine Rentiere nicht von streunenden
Hunden angegriffen werden,

wo meine Jagdpfade nicht von Wilderern zertrampelt oder von
Fahrzeugen verdreckt werden,

wo auf Fluessen und Seen keine Oelteppiche liegen.

Ich will Land, wo mein Zuhause, meine Freistatt und mein
Friedhof unverletzlich sind.

Ich will Land, wo man mir nicht die Kleider oder Stiefel am
hellichten Tag stehlen kann.

Gib mir mein eigenes Land, nicht das von jemand anderem.

Nur ein kleines Stueck von meinem eigenen Land."

Bericht ueber eine Studienreise in die Region Tjum_n von Heike
Drillisch und Johannes Rohr

Alexei Gyndyschew (Eigennamen wurden veraendert.) lebt mit
seiner Frau und sechs Kindern auf ihrem Wohnplatz auf dem Gebiet
des Dorfes Russkinskje. Ein Zufall brachte uns zu ihnen. Da
alle Hubschrauber - im Sommer das einzige Transportmittel - der
regionalen Oelgesellschaft gehoeren, muss ein Flug immer vorher
bestellt werden. Wir hatten Glueck, dass gerade die Schulkinder
von den Wohnplaetzen im 3.000 km2 grossen Einzugsbereich des
Dorfes eingesammelt wurden, um die naechsten Monate im Internat
zu verbringen. Daher war fuer einige Tage der Hubschrauber im
Auftrag der Dorfverwaltung unterwegs und nahm uns mit. Alexei
und seine Familie sind Chanty und traditionelle
RentierzuechterInnen. Ihr Sommerwohnplatz besteht aus einer
Blockhuette, einer Kochstelle im Freien und diversen
Vorratshaeusern. Er liegt auf einer schmalen, sumpfigen
Landzunge zwischen zwei Seen. Fuer die anderen Jahreszeiten
haben sie weitere Wohnplaetze in waldigen Gebieten. Ein
Verwandter wohnt in der Naehe, alle anderen Nachbarn in 10 - 20
km Entfernung. Strom gibt es auf dem Wohnplatz nicht, die Huette
wird abends mit einer Petroleumlampe beleuchtet. Andere
industriell gefertigte Gueter gibt es in geringer Zahl; die
Haeuser, Schlitten, Fischreusen usw. stellt jeder
Rentierzuechter selbst her. Fuer den alltaeglichen Bedarf werden
vor allem Jagdausruestung und Zucker gekauft, ausserdem
Lebensmittel wie Mehl, Tee, Zucker und bei einigen Familien
Alkohol. Das Hauptnahrungsmittel - der Fisch - wird aber jeden
Tag selbst gefangen. Alexei besitzt 10 Rentiere, die er jetzt im
Spaetsommer sich selbst ueberlaesst und nach dem ersten
Schneefall zusammentreiben wird, um mit ihnen mitzuziehen. Er
hat sie nach dem Zerfall der Sowchose, fuer die er als
Rentierhirte gearbeitet hat, uebernommen. Um sich davon zu
ernaehren und genuegend Felle fuer Kleidung, Betten usw. zu
haben, braucht eine Familie 50 - 100 Tiere. Mehr als zehn kann
das Land, das Alexei zur Verfuegung steht, aber nicht ernaehren.
Die Hauptnahrungsquelle fuer die Rentiere ist das Rentiermoos,
eine ausgesprochen empfindliche Pflanze, die ca. 1 mm im Jahr
waechst. Manche Familien haben gar keine Tiere mehr. Manchen
RentierzuechterInnen wurden die Tiere von Wilderern oder
Oelarbeitern abgeschossen. Einem Nachbarn von Alexei starb die
gesamte Herde, weil sie oelverschmutzte Flechten gefressen
hatte. Die Tiere, die ueberleben, sind haeufig krank und viel
schwaecher als frueher. Als Ernaehrungsgrundlage fuer die
Menschen bleibt daher nur der Fischreichtum der Seen und
Wasserlaeufe. Bei allen Familien, die wir trafen, gab es bisher
noch ausreichend Fisch, aber nicht nur Alexei klagte darueber,
dass Menge und Qualitaet der Fische stark abgenommen haetten.
Auch der Bestand an anderen Nahrungs- und Erwerbsquellen (u. a.
Beeren, Pelztiere, Voegel) ist stark zurueckgegangen. Der Grund
dafuer liegt vor allem in der Oelfoerderung. Nachts ist der
Horizont flammendrot, da die Begleitgase ungenutzt abgefackelt
werden. Havarien verseuchen Boden und Gewaesser - selbst im Dorf
Russkinskje ist das Leitungswasser von einem Oelfilm bedeckt.
Durch Arbeitsfahrzeuge werden die sensiblen Rentierflechten
zerstoert und ganze Flusslaeufe zugeschuettet. Ueber die
Schneisen entfernen sich die Rentiere viel weiter als frueher
ueblich vom Wohnplatz, zurueckgelassene Ausruestung rostet
langsam vor sich hin. Nicht einmal die heiligen Gebiete der
Chanty, die gleichzeitig ein Rueckzugsgebiet fuer viele Tier-
und Pflanzenarten darstellen, sind davon ausgenommmen. Die
Oelfoerderung begann in Westsibirien in den 60er Jahren, ohne
dass die indigenen BewohnerInnen gefragt wurden. Heutzutage ist
die industrielle Nutzung des Landes ohne die Zustimmung der
lokalen Bevoelkerung unzweideutig verboten. Die Oelfirmen sind
gezwungen, sog. "oekonomische Vereinbarungen" mit den
BewohnerInnen abzuschliessen. Diese versprechen meist "Geld"
oder "Benzin" als Gegenleistung fuer die Zustimmung zur
Oelfoerderung. Da aber oft keine genauen Mengen festgelegt
werden, erfolgt kaum eine Lieferung. Ein nicht unerheblicher
Teil der Vereinbarungen kommt unter Alkoholeinfluss zustande,
wovon Vertraege zeugen, in denen als einzige Gegenleistung fuer
die Zustimmung verlangt wird, dass die Oelleute"nicht die
Rentiere beim Weiden stoeren" sollen. Doch nicht einmal diese
Minimalversprechen werden immer eingehalten. Alexei Gyndyschew
bemerkte im vergangenen Winter, dass auf seinem Land, 3 km vom
Wohnplatz entfernt, Ausruestungsgegenstaende abgeladen wurden,
ohne dass er ueberhaupt gefragt wurde. Der zustaendige Beamte
erklaerte uns, dass Alexei sicherlich im naechsten Herbst eine
"oekonomische Vereinbarung" unterzeichnen wuerde, deshalb sei es
ja kein Problem, dass die Oelfirmen schonmal mit der Arbeit
begaennen. Die Moeglichkeit, dass Alexei einer weiteren
Oelfoerderung nicht zustimmen will, sondern sein Land bewahren
will, wird gar nicht erst in Betracht gezogen. Anders liegt der
Fall bei Michail Taewlin, einem nenzischen Rentierzuechter, der
in einer benachbarten Region lebt. Er erfuhr nur zufaellig von
der bevorstehenden Vergabe von Oelfoerderlizenzen auf seinem
Land. Wiederholt stellte er klar, dass er der Foerderung nicht
zustimmte, u. a. waehrend der Kommmissionssitzung, bei der die
Lizenz vergeben wurde: All dies half nichts, im Angesicht
lockender Profite zaehlt das verbriefte Recht der indigenen
Bevoelkerung nicht. In den Staedten wird die ruecksichtslose
Ausbeutung der Oellager- staetten damit gerechtfertigt, dass die
RentierzuecherInnen sich gar nicht mehr selbst ernaehren
koennten und von den Lieferungen der Oelfirmen abhaengig seien.
Auf den Wohnplaetzen sieht die Realitaet anders aus. In der
Regel hatten die Familien, die wir trafen, hoechstens einmal
Lebensmittel oder Benzin erhalten. Sie sind es gewohnt, voellig
fuer sich selbst zu sorgen. Ihre Hauptforderung an die
Oelgesellschaften ist, dass genuegend sauberes Land bleibt, um
die Rentierzucht weiterfuehren zu koennen. Erst an zweiter
Stelle steht die Forderung nach Kompensationen fuer die
Zerstoerung, die die Oelfoerderung bereits angerichtet hat. Dies
sagen nicht nur die alten Leute. Wir trafen eine Reihe junger
Maenner und Frauen, die nach der Schule auf die Wohnplaetze im
Wald zurueckkehrten, um dort die Lebensweise ihrer Eltern
fortzusetzen. Im Dorf leben zu muessen, bedeutet fuer sie den
Untergang. Angesichts der grossen Distanzen zwischen den
Wohnplaetzen und der Uebermacht der Oelgesellschaften ist fuer
die indigene Bevoelkerung ein gezieltes gemeinsames Vorgehen
sehr schwierig. Die lange Erfahrung, dass die Verantwortlichen
doch tun, was sie wollen, und die teils gewaltsame Zerschlagung
des Widerstands, der sich in der Perestroika-Zeit bildete, haben
das Gefuehl der Hoffnungslosigkeit hinterlassen. Dennoch gibt es
noch immer einzelne Rentierzuechter, die den Oelfirmen den
Zutritt zu ihrem Land verweigern - notfalls mit der Flinte in
der Hand. 1989 gruendete sich im Bezirk der Chanty und Mansi die
"Assoziation zur Rettung der Jugr", im Bezirk der Jamal-Nenzen
die Organisation "Jamal Potomkam" (Jamal den Nachkommen). Die
Arbeitsschwerpunkte der Organisationen reichen je nach
personeller Besetzung von der Forderung nach angemessener
Beteiligung an den Gewinnen aus der Ressourcenausbeutung bis zur
Unterstuetzung der RentierzuechterInnen bei der Forderung nach
dem Erhalt des Landes. Da die AktivistInnen der Assoziation zum
groessten Teil StadtbewohnerInnen sind und oft die Verbindung
zum Rentierzuechterdasein verloren haben, fordern sie in der
Hauptsache eine ausreichende Entschaedigung, um sich eine neue
Lebensgrundlage aufzubauen. Auch die Abhaengigkeit von
oeffentlichen Mitteln, die zum groessten Teil aus der
Oelfoerderung stammen, erschwert es der Assoziationen, fuer eine
radikale Eingrenzung der Foerdertaetigkeit einzutreten. Fuer die
derzeitige Vorsitzende der Assoziation zur Rettung der Jugr hat
trotzdem die Bewahrung der Rentierzucht eine gewisse Prioritaet.
Ein Ansatz zur Loesung des Konflikts zwischen der Oelindustrie
und den Rechten der Indigenen ist z. B. die Verwendung von
Mustervertraegen. In ihnensind der Schutz festgelegter Gebiete
(z. B. heilige Plaetze, Brutplaetze von Voegeln, Fischplaetze
usw.), die Einzaeunung und Abdichtung der Bohrplaetze, bestimmte
Summen als Entschaedigung, das Verbot von Waffen und Hunden fuer
die Oelarbeiter, die Beseitigung entstandener Schaeden u. a.
festgelegt. Von einigen Indigenen wird die Forderung nach einem
Moratorium fuer die Erschliessung neuer Bohrstellen erhoben mit
dem Ziel, besonders sensible Gebiete, z. B. Oberlaeufe der
Fluesse, unter Schutz zu stellen und neue Technologien zu
entwickeln. Im Umfeld der grossen, schon erschoepften
Lagerstaetten befinden sich eine Vielzahl kleiner Lagerstaetten,
die ausgebeutet werden koennten, ohne dass zusaetzlich Menschen
vertrieben werden muessten. An diesem Punkt sind auch die
westlichen Firmen gefragt. Deutschland bezieht ein Sechstel
seines Erdoels und ein Drittel seines Erdgases aus der
Russischen Foederation, grossenteils aus dem Tjumener Gebiet.
Gerade fuer Erdgas wird z. Zt. massiv mit dem Slogan "saubere
Energie" geworben. Abgesehen von der oekolgischen
Fragwuerdigkeit einer solchen Aussage werden dabei die
menschenrechtlichen Folgen unseres Energiekonsums voellig
ausgeblendet.  Bisher haben sich die beteiligten deutschen
Firmen einem Dialog ueber diese Frage verweigert. Die Aufgabe
von Kirchen, Menschenrechts- und Umweltschutzorganisationen wird
es daher sein, sie dennoch dazu zu bewegen, sich ihrer
Verantwortung zu stellen.

Amoco and Indigenous peoples

The Amoco corporation is one of the most active western
companies working in the oil and gas development areas of
Western Siberia. For some years now they are working on
developing the Priobskoye oilfield in the bassin of the Ob river
in Khanty-Mansi autonomous district, Tyumen region. Also they
are involved in the exploitation of the huge gas fields of Yamal
peninsula, the northernmost part of Yamal-Nenets autonomous
district, also Tyumen region. Environmentalists and
representatives of the indigenous population (Nenets, Khanty)
have for years been protesting against the latter project.

Yamal peninsula is the home of some 4000 indigenous reindeer
herders who maintain a traditional nomadic lifestyle. Many
experts have estimated that development of the rich natural gas
supplies will mean the end to this ecologically sound way of
life. Still Amoco corporation has done a good job in convincing
local elites (both indigenous and non-indigenous) of the
opposite by inviting them on a PR trip to Canada, also by making
donations to these representatives and by other means.

However local activists and reindeer herders don't have access
to independent sources of information about western companies.
Even of the Ogoni case and the struggle of the Lubicon Cree
nobody we met ever heard of. On our trip to Western Siberia last
summer we have been asked many times to provide such information.

Russian pipeline spills 1,500 tons of oil

Reuters, March 14, 1996 - A pipeline leak in Russia's main
oil-producing region of Tyumen in Western Siberia has spilled
1,500 tons of crude oil over nearby swamps and a frozen river,
Interfax news agency said Wednesday. The pipeline ruptured on
March 7 in the Nefteyugansk area, 40 miles from the city of
Surgut and repair work was continuing, the agency quoted local
environmental official Viktor Dolinger as saying. The spill
covered 8.6 acres of swamps and 2.5 acres of the frozen River
Balyk, a tributary of the River Ob, Dolinger said, adding that
the accident had now been localized and special equipment was
being used to clean up the area. The oil on the river was being
burned, although the pollution had reached areas up to five
miles from the ruptured pipeline, he said. The River Ob was
unlikely to be contaminated, he added.

THE DEEPER INTO THE FOREST.......

by Olga Bel'dina (Pravda Thursday, 14.III.1996 No. 39, 27685) -
Every time I hear the Russian rouble called 'wooden', I have
more empathy for the trees than I do for the rouble. In our
country, even given the current boarders, the tree has a
difficult fate. What is taking place in the Russian forest is
like no where else in the world. Europe would never allow the
kind of activities that go on here in Russia. Summer is
beginning, and with it, the forest fire season. It is the same
every year. There are a few notices in the 'highlights' section
of the newspaper, we all go ooohhhh!, take a bit of pause at the
figures, say "... and why is it that there are <a name=L10004></a><a href=#L10005>so</a> many forests
burning ..." and then forget the whole thing. Summer is in
general a difficult period. Summer is the season for forest
pests that multiply at frightening rates. Last year there were
<a name=L10005></a><a href=#L10006>so</a> many moths that foresters simply shook their heads. As soon
as a pest took to 'working' the woods in Krasnoyarskii Krai,
700,000 hectares were lost. There is a need to fight forest
pests on over 967,000 hectares but this requires 39 billion
roubles. And of the 84 billion roubles needed to fight fires,
all of 45 billion has been budgeted. Forest problems are the
same year in and year out, but the impact of modern economic
change on the forest is especially severe. For example, timber
sector enterprises are being <a name=L10006></a><a href=#L10007>so</a> ruthlessly privatized that many
of the controlling interests are being gobbled up by foreign
corporations. Take for example the Svetlorogskii, Balakhninskii,
Kotlaskii Pulp and Paper Plants. Forests are a good investment
when there isn't anyone watching over what is going on. In
Novgorodskii Oblast', for example, a Swedish firm "Modo"
purchased the rights from the local LesPromKhoz to harvest
100,000 cubic meters a year for 49 years! Modo got the rights
rather cheaply - 52 million Finnish marks. There is also the
tendency in the last few years for local authorities to try and
make profits from the forest. It is true that each region has
its own specifics. In Krasnodarskii Krai, valuable oak forests
are being harvested for sale to Turkey and to Mediterranean
countries. All this takes place like a slight of hand trick.
That is what tempts people into the forest. In 1995 more than
417,000 cubic meters of timber was harvested without permits and
there were 609 documented attempts to develop forest lands
illegaly. The number of people assigned to pursue forest law
violators grows smaller and smaller each year. It is true that
the government is not lax in their efforts to issue a steady
stream of rules and regulations, but what does it matter when
there are not enough people to enforce the law. Taiga forests
are turning into bogs: 40 percent of the forests in
Kalingradskii Oblast are below sea level. Earlier a poldor
method was used to drain the lands, pumping water across dams.
Now the pumping station is out of order. We talk and think about
the forest as if there weren't any connection between forest
activities and the general condition of the environment. But for
instance, take the relationship between forests and fish. The
forest next to the river acts as a guard for fish stocks,
especially salmon and sturgeon. At the current time more than 43
million hectares of riparian forests protect spawning habitat;
this is more forest than the total volume for Finland and Sweden
combined. Fish, air, soil and trees is a closed cycle of
survival. As they used to say, "...forests are our bounty..."
But now?

TO THE FEDERAL DUMA - FROM THE PRIMORSKII KRAI FOREST SERVICE

(Vladivostok 15.III.1996, No. 49, 1673) - The Primorskii Krai
Forest Service conducted a seminar at which various issues
connected with rational forest resource use were discussed.
There was much talk about flaws in contemporary forest
protection legislation - Raion administrators have now been
given greater authority in the area of timber harvest and a
result of this policy is that the number of violations of
standing law are growing. For all intents and purposes the
harvest of ash is out of control. Large volumes of timber are
being exported abroad. Employment conditions for those charged
with protecting the forest were also discussed. Criminal
activities in the forest are increasing, <a name=L10007></a><a href=#L10008>so</a> what can be said of
the 150,000 rouble salary of foresters who, in fact, don't see
any wages for months at a time. In addition, there is a
tremendous growth in the number of timber harvesting operations:
in Anuchinskii Raion, 36 foresters are responsible for
monitoring the activities of more than 200 timber harvesting
operations; in such conditions it is extremely difficult to
monitor timber harvest. Suggestions for improving forest
legislation were presented at the seminar; a major topic is the
effort to prevent privatization of the forest, a provision now
included in the new Forest Code. It is the opinion of many
specialists that privatization of the forest will lead to its
destruction. All the recommendations adopted at the seminar will
be sent to the Federal Duma.

Projekte von USAID im Chabarovskij und Primorskij Kraj

Anatolii Lebedev (Utro Rossii, 24.02.1966 / No. 37, 1206) -
Timber industry politics in the Russian Far East have become <a name=L10008></a><a href=#L10009>so</a>
bad that to discuss improvements for the better sounds like a
Monday morning forecast for a Sunday afternoon sporting event.
Some even say the talk is dangerous. Genuine control is robbed
of vitality, the number of daring gyppo operators and timber
exporters exceeds any imaginable limit, timber is harvested
where ever and how ever, without licenses, without tariff fees
and taxes, using outdated equipment. In short, the situation in
the taiga is simply out of control. Timber extraction has become
a fast way to grab at some dear capital. All one has to do is
cut it down and get it to the appropriate port. Any anyone who
gets in the way of this policy, tries to put a halt it, well,
they are show a different road. The U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) spent two years getting a
sense of current timber politics in the region and another year
working out a project an alternative to current practices. The
Environmental Policy and Technology Project (EPT), using a 16.5
million dollar budget, is an attempt to organize a different
strategy to managing the biodiversity of the central
Sikhote-Alin bioregion of Khabarovskii and Primorskii Krai. And
just recently, Agency officials gathered together with their
Russian colleagues to assess the current work. In summarizing
the results (...) Dean Stepanik, Project Director, put it this
way: "... We have pointed out that there are a lot of difficult
issues. This is good; it means that we are working..." The EPT
project is part of an economic and technology assistance package
the U.S. government is providing Russia through the Gore
Chernomyrdin Agreements. Project objectives are to assist the
forest sectors in Khabarovskii and Primorskii Krai, to develop
environmentally sustainable small business, to provide
assistance in fighting forest fires, to support existing and to
create new protected territories, to support democratic
initiatives and to develop local self government. For those
involved in regional taiga politics and who want to give into
the banditry occurring in the forests, there is no need to talk
about how important this project is for the two regional
governments. True, not a particularly large amount of money is
involved. But we also all know that to rely upon Moscow for
reasonable funding is a waste of time. Regional timber industry
officials are want to make investments in the processing sector,
something that is understandable given government financing
policy. The small business fund being created at the urging of
the parties participating in the project will assist small
private firms interested in collecting, processing and marketing
the treasures of the forest get off the ground by providing
start up capital. Modern, small scale processing facilities are
foreseen. The finished goods from these facilities will reduce,
in theory, the total volume of timber harvested in the region,
while increasing local revenues. Model projects are underway in
Chuguevskii Raion in Primorskii Krai and Vyazemskii and Lazo
Raions in Khabarovskii Krai. These regions are major suppliers
of timber in the region and the experience gained there will
then be extended to other regions. There is also a small program
to encourage local self management and small business is being
financed in two national villages in the Khor and Bikin River
watersheds. Larisa Vachaeva, head of the natural resources
planning department in the Khabarovskii Krai administration, and
chairperson of that Krai's EPT Coordinating Committee, drew the
attention of those present at the review meeting to the urgency
of concentrating project funds on finding ways to resolve the
economic and social issues facing the Udege, the indigenous
people living in these two regions. To date, Russian-American
specialists have provided assistance in preventing and
extinguishing forest fires and in purchasing much needed
equipment for a majority of the region's zapovedniks. As an
exception to the rule that equipment purchased with USAID funds
must be of U.S. origin, domestic Russian transport was secured
for the zapovedniks. This means that a greater number of
vehicles can be purchased, and for those providing protection to
the RFE's zapovedniks, this is very important. Additional to the
current funding of protected territories, the project envisions
creating a trust fund to be used once the project is completed
to protect biodiversity not only within the zapovedniks but
through the entire project area where industrial timber harvest
occurs. A mapping system for the entire resource base of
Chuguevskii Raion is nearly completed. Based upon this work, the
leasing process for timber lots and hunting territories, the
monitoring and enforcement of current laws governing the taiga
will then be much more effectively and intelligently carried
out. The EPT project, like most American projects of its type,
is spending a significant portion of its funds on education and
training of specialists as well a on environmental education,
relying heavily upon the region's NGO sector. Many Krai and
Raion forest sector specialists and administrators have had a
chance to familiarize themselves with the experience of their
American colleagues, and many openly admit that these meeting
have radically changed their perspective on the mission of the
project, its goals and methods. Domestically barbaric approaches
to resource use are being questioned and the EPT project is seen
as an opportunity to begin a process to implement long needed
changes in regional timber policy. This does not mean that all
are quick to jump at the chance to copy progressive American
models; these models are not always applicable and often far
from progressive. The EPT project is providing an opportunity to
identify the best in both countries and to apply such in
practice. Growing confidence among colleagues in the forest
sector is an unexpected and invaluable result of the EPT
project. In an age of extreme budget deficits, it is no secret
that forest service agencies are attempting to generate revenues
any way they can, selling not only timber but information about
the condition of the forests as well. This often pushes projects
to develop effective data bases into a dead end, one in which
not only academic institutions but regional government agencies
participate. The EPT project is attempting to provide a venue
for all interested parties to cooperatively share information
for the more effective management of the biodiversity of the
central Sikhote-Alin. The largest scale project of this type is
the work being conducted to survey the Amur Tiger. The work
began last year and early this year a census was conducted in
both Khabarovskii and Primorskii Krai. The census is but a first
step in implementing an integrated plan to protecting this
living symbol of the Ussuri taiga. Separate portions of this
project are being funded by EPT and by other international and
national organizations. In early March results from the review
will presented for discussion to the Primorskii Krai
Coordination Committee. And perhaps, with time a bit of our
general consumer attitude toward the forests will change. And
somehow it is a bit awkward: it is really necessary that some
from the outside has to come in and save our treasures for us?

The Murma river project - developing Sustainable Forestry in
Siberia

By Rosa Babintseva and Vladimir Gorbachev - University of
Krasnoyarsk / From Taiga News no.16 - Forestry practices of
Russian lespromkhozi (timber enterprises) are unsustainable.
They destroy forest resources by overlogging and altering forest
composition. They do poor business planning and fail to include
the public in decision-making. Landscape zoning, business
planning, and public involvement in decision-making must be
implemented now, to preserve Siberia's forests and communities.
An ecosystem- and community-friendly pilot forestry project is a
necessary first step. In this article, one such project in the
Murma river watershed of central Siberia is presented by two
forestry experts involved. Part of the project is conducted in
co-operation with the Predivinsky lespromkhoz. The primary goal
of the work in Predinvinsk is to promote public/NGO
participation in Siberian forest management decision-making and
to improve the economical and ecological sustainability of the
Predivinsky enterprise. The timber industry in Siberia is based
on clear cut logging. It includes the use of heavy logging
machinery which causes irremediable harm to forest ecosystems.
Often water and wind erosion occurs and the soil cover is
disturbed. The hydrological balance of the forest landscape is
also disturbed. As a result of these and other effects, natural
regeneration is poor and the forest productivity is reduced. In
addition, the use of heavy machinery in logging operations leads
to reduction of employment, which in turn increases the social
tensions. Logging in Russia used to be concentrated in the hands
of large enterprises (lespromkhozes), resource bases that
controlled hundreds of thousands of hectares. The population of
forest settlements were usually completely economically
dependent upon the local lespromkhoz. This is still very much
the case. If the resource base of the lespromkhos is depleted,
this is not only an ecological problem, but also a
socioeconomical one. In fact, the very existence of the
settlement is jeopardised by unsustainable forestry management.
Thus, there are strong incentives for developing sustainable
forest management models in Siberia. However, forest management
systems elaborated for large territory units (for example for
Western or Eastern Siberia) will not be effective, even if they
prove to be correct and rational. To be workable, any such
system must concern a specific region and be based upon the
actual natural and economical conditions. (...)

ALTERNATIVE FORESTRY IN SIBERIA: The work on the project
Alternative Forestry in Siberia started in 1994. The initiator
of the project was Pacific Environment & Resources Center
(PERC), in particular its representatives Lisa Tracy and David
Gordon. The results this far provide a useful guide for future
work on the project. At present the project is being carried out
by a collective of Siberian scientists. The well-known Canadian
forest scientist Herb Hammond is assisting the project as a
consultant. The goal of the project is to elaborate strategy and
tactics for sustainable use of various Siberian taiga resources
for the concrete territory. The focus is on preservation of
forest ecosystem resources and ecological functions. The
concrete goal is to elaborate and bring to implementation an
alternative forest management system which provides continual
use of forest resources in a Siberian river basin and to give
ecological and economic grounds of suggested measures.

THE PROJECT AREA: The Murma river basin, covering 87,000
hectares, was chosen as the experimental area. The tree species
composition in the area is 11.5 % pine, 20.7 % fir, 16.0 %
spruce, 8.1 % cedar, 4.5 % larch, 22.0 % birch and 22.2 % aspen.
Preliminary studies of the economic efficiency of alternative
forestry in the Murma basin revealed the necessity of
considering some peculiarities of Siberian forests. In
particular, forest productivity is 2-3 times lower than in
Canada. Timber of the prevailing coniferous species fir (Abies
sibirica) and spruce (Picea obovata) is of no commercial value.
Furthermore, large areas in the basin are covered with secondary
forests, consisting of birch (Betula pendula) and aspen (Populus
tremula). There is presently no domestic market for birch and
aspen timber, and the export market is inaccessible because of
the low quality characteristics of the timber and high
transportation costs. Complete processing of timber is not
available locally, due to lack of equipment and technologies.
Processing of non-timber products meets the same difficulties.
The conclusion of what has been said above is that forest
management in the river Murma basin can be ecologically
sustainable, but it will not be profitable due to the small size
of the watershed. Economically optimal basin sizes will vary,
depending on the actual natural conditions (productivity,
volumes and diversity of forest resources) and the
socio-economic situation.

INVOLVING THE LOCAL TIMBER ENTERPRISE: As it became obvious that
the social problems of the settlement could not be solved
through developing forestry management in the Murma basin only,
the idea of widening the project margins was suggested by the
director of the Predivinsk lespromkhoz, V.M.Malkevich. Today,
Mr. Malkevich takes active part in the project elaboration and
supports the research collective. His resource base is situated
in the Bolshaya Murta region, Krasnoyarsk territory. It consists
of over 100,000 hectares and includes seven basins of small
rivers. Part of the watershed of the Murma river is included in
this area. The 3,000 inhabitants of Predivinsk are completely
dependent on the lespromkhoz. The project was planned for 3
years (1994-1996) and consisted of three stages: 

Mapping of the ecological basis (data base formation) and
ecological zoning of the territory. 

Scientific grounds of methods for alternative forestry
management within the single ecological zones and technical
grounds (elaboration of machinery and technology) of collecting
and processing all kinds of forest products.

Economic grounds of the whole cycle of the planned measures,
including logging and wasteless processing, employment planning
and production realisation on the markets of various levels.

The information collected for the first stage gave a complete
nature characteristics of the resource base and a comprehensive
picture of biological diversity of this territory. Based on this
information, ecological zoning was carried out. Additionally
soil map was compiled. However, we think that a series of
soil-ecological maps are needed, to serve as the basis for
various forest management and forest industry measures: logging
and scidding method; elaboration of methods of natural
regeneration assistance; tree species selection for artificial
reforestation, in accordance with forest-vegetation soil
qualities; elaboration of measures against possible swamping of
cuts; organisation of territory and selection of areas for
agricultural use to create fodder and food bases and <a name=L10009></a><a href=#L10010>so</a> on. At
present the second stage of the project is being performed,
aiming at elaboration of management systems for various
ecological zones.

THE PREDIVINSKY LESPROMKHOZ: The Predivinsky Lespromkhoz was
founded in 1928 and is presently employing 1,100 people. The
village of Predivinsk has a population of 5,000 (when including
the neighbouring villages of Chernoye, Grebin, Posolnoye.) The
main industries of the village are forestry and agriculture
(just started in 1995) Predivinsky Lespromkhoz currently leases
149,000 hectares of forest land, out of which 83,000 hectares
are classified as exploitable. The exploitable timber volume is
about 18 million cubic metres. The average volume per hectare is
173 cubic meters, which is about average for Siberia. Predivinsk
has had a working sawmill since the early 1940s. Wood products
are sold within the territory, with the cities of Krasnoyarsk
and Krasnoyarsk-26 as main buyers. In the past the sawmill has
sold products to Moscow, Azerbaidjan, and Artem (Far East).
These trade relations have been cut off because of
transportation problems and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Occasionally raw logs or lumber is sold to "intermediaries" who
purchase it for unknown destinations, most probably for the
foreign market. The sawmill produces lumber for construction,
wagons and ships, but also chips (to pulp at the Krasnoyarsk
Pulp Mill), raw logs, walls, veneer, parquet (birch), panels
(birch), and fir oil. Fir and spruce are the basis for all
products (there is very little pine in the area). The
lespromkhoz used to produce intermediate furniture products,
furniture articles, and details for standard size homes. These
products were sold to Azerbaidjan. Now there are competing
furniture factories in Krasnoyarsk, <a name=L10010></a><a href=#L10011>so</a> the Predivinsky
Lespromkhoz's furniture section was closed.

Gassinsky - a model forest project in the Russian Far East

By Andrei Laletin - Andrei Laletin is forest researcher and
leader of Friends of the Siberian Forest, a NGO based in
Krasnoyarsk . From Taiga News no 16) - The Gassinsky Model
forest is situated in the Khabarovsk region in the Russian Far
East. The natural borders of the model forest are the
Sikhote-Alin mountain range and the left bank of the Amur river.
The total territory of the model forest is 384,484 ha. If the
very good objectives of the project can be implemented, the
project may be important for the development of sustainable
forestry in the Russian Far East. The project is lead and
sponsored by the Canadian Government (Departments of Foreign
Affairs and International Trade), the Canadian Forest Service,
the Federal Forest Service of Russia, the regional
administration of Khabarovsk and the regional Forest Service.
There are about 20 partners participating in the project. The
project started in November 1994 and is planned to be completed
in April, 1997. Out of the total area of the model forest,
288,661 hectares are industrial forests, while 94,734 hectares
(25 %) are protected. The main tree species are spruce (Picea
ajanensis) and fir (Abies nephrolepis) together accounting for
49 % of the growing stock. Other significant tree species are
the Korean cedar pine (Pinus koreaensis) (12 %), two species of
birch (Betula mandshurica and B. costata) (17 %) and larch
(Larix dahurica) (10 %). There are well over one thousand plant
species in the model forest area. Many of them have useful
applications as edible and medicinal herbs. As concerns rare and
endangered plants 44 species have been registered. Of these, 27
are listed in the Red Data Book of Russia. The fauna is also
very diverse, including more than 20 species of mammals (for
example, sable, mink, squirrel, moose, fox and bear) and more
than 50 bird species. The Gassinsky model forest project was
created on the basis of the concept of sustainable development,
partnership and biodiversity protection for the interest of the
local population, especially the nanaitsy, the indigenous people
of the area. During the first year of the project implementation
the main focus was information and educational activities. The
project was introduced for the Nanaisky district community and
was advertised there. The Partnership Council and the Board of
Directors of the project were created, appointing
representatives of government, industry, science, and indigenous
peoples. A project office was set up and put into operation and
a schedule for future work was prepared. Some field data were
gathered during expeditions made by researchers from the
Institute of Water and Ecological Problems of Far Eastern Branch
of Russian Academy of Sciences and this Forestry Institute of
Russian Federal Forest Service. This was of course only the
beginning of the field work phase of the project. The main work
is to be made during the next two years.

Russische Baeume fuer US-Saegewerke faellen und bestrahlen

Von Tilman Streif, Seattle (dpa) - Ein Fuenftel aller Waelder
der Erde stehen in Sibirien, und im Nordwesten der USA sind
wegen Holzmangels die Saegewerke ohne Arbeit. US-Investoren
haben sich deshalb ein Projekt ausgedacht, das Umweltschuetzern
den Atem verschlaegt: Sibirische Baeume sollen gefaellt und dann
in den US-Bundesstaaten Oregon und Washington zu Bauholz
verarbeitet werden. Vor dem Export sollen sie noch in Sibirien
bestrahlt werden, um Krankheitserreger in den Staemmen
abzutoeten. Die dabei eingesetzten Gammastrahlen werden aus
radioaktivem Kobalt gewonnen. Mehr als vierzig
Umweltschutzorganisationen in Russland und den USA haben einen
Offenen Brief an US-Vizepraesident Al Gore verfasst, der in
dieser Woche in Washington mit dem russischen
Ministerpraesidenten Viktor Tschernomyrdin ueber
Wirtschaftsfragen diskutierte. "Steuerzahler in den USA
finanzieren Aktivitaeten, die einmalige Waelder zerstoeren
koennten", heisst es in dem Brief der Umweltschuetzer. Die
US-Handelsbehoerde unterstuetzt mit Zuschuessen die Plaene, die
Waelder in der sibirischen Khabarowsk-Region zugunsten der
heimischen Industrie abzuholzen. 500 000 Dollar erhielt eine
Gruppe von Saegewerksbesitzern fuer eine Studie, die den
wirtschaftlichen Nutzen der Abholzung in Russlands Osten
ermitteln soll. Gleichzeitig aber bemueht sich die Forstbehoerde
US Forest Service, den Lebensraum des sibirischen Tigers in
dieser Gegend zu erhalten. "Absolut widerspruechlich" ist nach
Meinung von David Gordon das Verhalten der US-Regierung. Gordon
spricht fuer das Umweltzentrum PERC, das die Federfuehrung beim
Protest uebernommen hat. PERC (Pacific Environment and
Ressources Center) setzt sich fuer den Aufbau einer
holzverarbeitenden Industrie in Sibirien selbst ein. <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>So</a> koennten
dort Arbeitsplaetze geschaffen und auch Entscheidungen ueber das
Ausmass der jaehrlichen Holzernte getroffen werden. "Damit waere
ein erneuerbarer Waldbestand sichergestellt", sagt David Gordon.
US-Investoren unter der Fuehrung der Firma REM dagegen wollen
100 Millionen Dollar (knapp 150 Millionen Mark) in das Projekt
stecken, Baeume aus Sibirien in die USA zu holen.
REM-Projektleiter Kurt Sagovac sagt, dass auch die geplanten elf
Bestrahlungsfabriken in Russland Arbeitsplaetze schaffen
wuerden. Den Vorwurf der Umweltschuetzer, dass dieses Projekt
Sibirien in eine US-Holzexportkolonie verwandeln koennte, laesst
Kurt Sagovac nicht gelten: "Russland muss wie jedes
Entwicklungsland seine Wirtschaft zunaechst mit dem Export von
Rohmaterial ankurbeln."

Dazu auch der Bericht von Anne Janssen (Aus Taiga News no 16)

(...) In a letter to Vice President Al Gore, 47 U.S. and Russian
environmental groups have expressed their concern over the
environmental consequences stemming from growing U.S. federal
financing of private companies logging Russia's primary forests,
particularly in Siberia and the Russian Far East. U.S. taxpayers
are financing several private joint ventures in Siberia and the
Russian Far East. According to the letter, the activities of
these private timber ventures could destroy unique forest
habitats. They could also undermine and contradict important
biodiversity conservation programs currently underway in the
Russian Far East, programs which are being implemented by U.S.
federal agencies (USAID, US Forest Service, etc.) and non-profit
groups. At the same time, OPIC, TDA and other U.S. government
agencies are funnelling millions of public dollars into private
joint timber ventures that will liquidate forests in the same
regions, often in the very areas targeted by conservationists
for biodiversity conservation or formal protected-territory
status. For example, TDA is providing $500,000 to the Global
Forestry Management Group (a private consortium of U.S.
sawmills) to carry out a feasibility study to log in the Khor
watershed and elsewhere. TDA has neglected to consider the fact
that the Khor's intact forests are vital for the survival of
native Udege people and the endangered Siberian tiger. OPIC is
supporting other private timber joint ventures in the Russian
Far East, including a GFMG venture to log a 1-million-acre tract
of virgin fir and spruce forests near Vysokogornoye, Khabarovsk
Region, and a Pioneer Group joint venture to log lowelevation
primary forest near Siziman Bay. Additionally, the Export-Import
Bank is developing a Memorandum of Understanding with the
Russian timber industry to promote U.S. government subsidised
exports to Russia of timber harvesting equipment including
chainsaws and bulldozers. Given the current lack of enforcement
of Russian forestry regulations, the equipment imported by Ex-Im
Bank will only increase the pace at which the Russian timber
industry is logging its primary forests. According to the
letter, these federally-backed plans will transform Siberia and
the Russian Far East into a massive whole-log export colony.

Since the end of 1995, Taiga Rescue Network has a new
International Coordinator in charge of the Jokkmokk office. Her
name is Anne Janssen. She introduces herself like this: Before
coming to TRN I was working with Greenpeace, all over Canada as
a fund raiser and then finally in Germany as the Forest Campaign
Assistant. The experience of working from both a consumer and
producer perspective is proving to be helpful in understanding
TRN activities and the potential of a boreal network. Our aims:
the protection and sustainable use of the boreal forests.

Wildlife in the Russian Amazon is under the threat

Bikin Basin is a unique territory in the Russian Far East which
comprises species diversity of southern Ussuriland, Amurland and
the Sikhote Alin range. It is the largest survived area of
virgin Ussuriland forests and thickets with complex
geomorphology, variety of landscapes, and high diversity of
flora and fauna. It is the last territory where Udege indigenous
hunters continue to live in their own settlement in a fragile
balance with the surrounding nature. (Note of Natalya Kanchuga,
Chairwoman of Bikin Obshchina: In fact, there are THREE
watersheds in the central Sikhote-Alin where Udege actively
pursue a traditional way of life. Two are in Primorskii Krai:
the Samarga River watershed with its national village, Agzu, and
the Bikin River watershed and the national village of Krasnyi
Yar. In Khabarovskii Krai, Udege hunt and trap in the Khor River
watershed; their national village is called Gvasyugi.) More than
170 species of birds breed in the Bikin Basin, twelve of which
(from 56 in a whole Russia) are listed in the categories of
Globally Threatened and Near-Threatened. Among them: Oriental
White Stork (Ciconia boyciana), Blakiston's Fish Owl (Ketupa
blackistoni), Japanese Crane (Grus japonensis), Hooded Crane
(Grus monacha), Chinese Merganser (Mergus squamatus), Mandarin
Duck (Aix galericulata), Long-billed Ringed Plover (Charadrius
placidus), Far-Eastern Curlew (Numenius madagascariensis),
Shrenk's Little Bittern (Ixobrychus eurhythmus), Siberian
Spruce-Grouse (Falcipennis falcipennis). The Bikins' populations
of the Hooded Crane, Blakiston's Fish Owl and Chinese Merganser
are possibly ones of the largest strongholds in the Far East.
Nowadays unique and exotic wild life of the Bikin-land is under
a threat. Only three years passed after a scandalous attempts of
South Korean Hyundai corporation to exterminate the Bikins
wildlife by logging the forests in the upper parts of the Bikin
area. The attempts had been stopped by the resistance of the
Udege people helped by Green Peace and other International
organizations (see Survival International newsletter 1992). Now
once again the Hyundai successors, calling themselves a
Russian-South Korean Joint-stock timber company "Svetlaya" and
some other similar enterprises continue their violent attempts
to log 300,000 ha of old-grown forests in the same area. If they
will be succeed, the last region of the virgin part of
Ussuriland will be brought to an end. It happened to the three
rest large Ussuriland rivers, Ussuri, Iman and Khor during last
50 years.  In fact, nowadays the Bikin Basin is the largest left
oasis of the Ussuriland biodiversity surrounded by the disturbed
lands. This oasis is packed between the logged forests in the
low and middle parts of the river and by low-diversity larch-
and birch - secondary forests in the upper parts of the river.
The logging of the upper Bikin watershed area will clearly
result in the irreversible shifts of the river's hydrographic
regime. This, in turn, will lead to frequent floods in rich
broad-leaved gallery forests causing its deterioration (as
happened to the forests along Iman and Khor rivers). The only
way to save this last refuge of the pristine Ussuriland
wilderness is to raise public awareness campaign for the
protection of this area. International research projects could
be also an important step in this direction as they could focus
attention of conservationists to the Bikin Basin and facilitate
world-wide public awareness. An initiative group of Russian
ornithologists has been carrying out surveys of the Bikin River
Basin (Primorsky region, Far East Russia) since 1990. Currently
we survey the large unexplored country in the upper reaches part
of the river, including elevated watersheds between Bikin River
and Khor River and between Bikin and the Japanese Sea (the site
of the barbarous logging activity). In 1995-1997 the research
was supported by the National Geographic Society. The main
objective of the study are:

extensive mapping of avian biodiversity and initiation of
species distribution data-base for the Bikin catchment area (the
point-counts, mist-netting and other methods are applied);

study of relationships between species and their complex
environment (patterns of distribution, habitat preferences,
stability of species assemblages).

future projects on biology and conservation of Hooded Crane,
Blakiston's Fish Owl, Chinese Merganser, Long-billed Ringed
Plover, Siberian Spruce Grouse and some other species.

making a film about the Bikin wild life

The future of the Bikin wildlife which is called Russian Amazon,
now entirely depends on the International conservation lobby and
cannot be solved within Russia. We do hope that our initiative
will contribute to the conservation on the region. Any your
comments and suggestions on this matter will be greatly
appreciated.

Ergaenzungen einer regionalen Aktivistin

Natalya Kanchuga, Chairwoman of Bikin Obshchina - (...) The
article addresses important issues, but unfortunately, contains
a number of distortions that we would like to draw to your
attention. 

(...) "... Now once again the Hyundai successors, calling
themselves a Russian-South Korean Joint-stock timber company
"Svetlaya" and some other similar enterprises continue their
violent attempts to log 300,000 ha of old-grown forests in the
same area..." In fact, the Russian-South Korean joint venture
"SVETLAYA' was in operation BEFORE the 1993 attempt to acquire a
timber base on the PEYA plato above the headwaters of the ZEVA
River basin that feeds into the Bikin River. The JV "SVETLAYA'
currently harvests timber in the SVETLAYA River watershed, on
the eastern, coastal slope of the Sikhote-Alin. The interest in
the Bikin remains strong among Hyundai and its representatives
continue to seek approval to cut in the Bikin. Hyundai's latest
attempt is under the guise of testing a theory of natural
reforestation developed by a Vladivostok forest specialist, Dr.
Yurii Manko. Manko's plan is to use selective cut methods to
harvest timber in the desiccating spruce stands in the
headwaters of the Zeva River. It is obvious that the clear cut
methods used on the Peya plato have led to the deforestation of
that region; attempts to artificially restock the area has
yielded very marginal results. Manko's plan calls for selective
cut that will leave a healthy atmosphere for natural
reforestation by removing the dead trees and providing young
live trees openings to mature into healthy forest. Manko wants
to watch a series of parameters against which to test his
theory: -- changes in hydrology;-- changes in the condition of
the forest edge;-- rate of natural regeneration. Hyuandi is
requesting a timber base of 50,000 cubic meters a year to begin
the test. If the results are 'positive' and forest ecology is
not degraded, increased volumes will be requested. Hyundai has
been unsuccessful in convincing the Primorskii Krai officials of
the efficacy of its plan and has not been provided any timber in
the Bikin upon which to run the experiment. At the same time,
Hyundai has made two trips to the village of Krasnyi Yar since
November 1995 in an attempt to gain approval of their plans from
the Udege. At a series of public meetings Hyundai
representatives were told that harvest in the headwaters runs
counter to the interests of local people and that they should
not expect any support from people in the Bikin. There are also
attempts by Russian timber consortiums working the forests of
TERNEI RAION to gain access to the Bikin. It is the opinion of
many that these companies pose a much greater threat to the
forests of the Bikin than does Hyuandi since it will be
difficult to block their efforts if they were to gain access to
the Bikin. Hyuandi is an international company and subject to
international public relations campaigns; domestic companies are
not <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a> vulnerable to international pressure. 

"...The only way to save this last refuge of the pristine
Ussuriland wilderness is to raise public awareness campaign for
the protection of this area..." The Udege of the central
Sikhote-Alin are working to such an end. In each of the three
national villages, a citizen advisory board, called an
obshchina, has been elected to gauge public opinion and promote
values and locally developed agendas. For instance, in Krasnyi
Yar, our Bikin Obshchina is engaged in a letter writing campaign
with Krai, Federal and international officials; the aim of the
correspondence is to encourage a timely resolution of the land
tenure and resource use issues in the Bikin that considers local
interests. On the Primorskii Krai level an effort is underway to
create a special protected territory in the middle and upper
portions of the Bikin River watershed. For the past four years,
Pavel Sulyandziga, President of the Association of Indigenous
Peoples of Primorskii Krai and Advisor to the Governor on
Indigenous Affairs has been spearheading the effort. Under the
direction of the Association of Indigenous Peoples of Primorskii
Krai, normative documents promoting the political, economic,
social and cultural interests of the region's indigenous peoples
are being prepared. The four pieces of legislation cover: Legal
Status of Indigenous Peoples in Primorskii Krai; Obshchina
(local self management body); Territory of Traditional Natural
Resource Use (TTP); Clan, Family and Other Forms of Traditional
Economic Organization. These projects will be presented to the
Primorskii Krai Duma legislation for consideration and eventual
passage. 

"...The future of the Bikin wildlife which is called Russian
Amazon, now entirely depends on the International conservation
lobby and cannot be solved within Russia..." This statement is
without basis, for it is only from within Russia that the Bikin
issue can be resolved. The international community can provide
moral, and at times, material support for local efforts; it
cannot resolve the issue for the people living in the Bikin.
Many international groups (Pacific Environment and Resources
Center, Sacred Earth Network, ISAR, USAID/EPT, Survival
International, Greenpeace and others) are working closely with
the people of the Bikin to develop land tenure legislation and
sustainable economic development programs that protect the
region's unique biodiversity and that meet historically evolved
land use needs of local people. The day to day contact with
these groups is helping us better understand what can be
accomplished in our effort to resolve the Bikin issue. It is our
opinion that if the international community attempts to 'solve'
the Bikin issue independently of local people and their
representatives in Primorskii Krai, its efforts are doomed to
fail. <a name=L10003></a><a href=#L10004>So</a> we suggest that we work together to accomplish the long
term protection of the Bikin watershed, its biodiversity and the
ways of its indigenous peoples. (...)

Territory of Traditional Natural Resource Use TTP in the Bikin
Region.

by Pavel Sulyandziga, President of Primorskii Region Association
of Indigenous Peoples (PRAIP), Krasnyi Yar. - Since to date
there are misunderstandings on what it means to organize and
operate a TTP in the Bikin, I would like to offer my comments.
Confusion among those interested and working on protected
territory issues in the Russisn Far East is caused by ignorance
of the 1993 Temporary Provision by the Primorskii Krai Council
of Deputies that creates procedure for creating a TTP and
existing Russian law on local self administration and resource
use is poorly understood. It has become obvious that
international groups as well as Russians are unclear on the
concept of a TTP.

1) What is a TTP? A TTP is a specially designated territory
consisting of landscapes essential to the traditional needs of
local peoples. Though a TTP might be called 'ethnic' territory,
it is in fact a protected territory that provides for indigenous
interests to remain in forest ecosystems and methods for
managing those systems on the long term.

2) What is achieved by creating a TTP in the Bikin? A TTP
extends existing specially protected territorial boundaries
established in the middle drainage of the Bikin River to include
the entire upper drainage. An opportunity is created to define
and implement management patterns for land, water and wildlife
that enhance the life of local peoples and provide practical
procedures that promote sustainable resource use. Indigenous
peoples become administratively vested in the territory as they
develop local self-management policies.

3) How does a TTP differ from other forms of protected
territory? A TTP provides indigenous peoples an administrative
right to oppose and veto development patterns that threaten
traditional economic activities. 

4) Can the Udege sell these lands? No. The fact is that the
watersheds natural resources in the TTP belong to the state and
not to indigenous peoples, and as such, this means that a right
to sell and lease these values is vested in Federal, Krai and
Raion administrations. As I pointed out earlier, a TTP provides
indigenous peoples an opportunity to block activities that local
people feel are inappropriate given landscape policy. 

5) What is needed to protect landscapes in the TTP? Develop and
adopt rules and other legally binding acts needed to manage a
TTP in Primorskii Krai; Attract capital investment that funds
local processing of non-timber forest products; Organize tourism
in the region; Address poaching throughout the watershed; Study
landscape components as part of a general program of interactive
management in the Bikin.

6) Why is a TTP, and not a national park or other specially
protected territory, an optimal choice for the Bikin? A TTP
satisfies two essential conditions: protection of native
assemblages and promotion of traditional activities for
indigenous peoples. The TTP also allows local people to develop
responsible landscape management practices. Other specially
protected territories (reserves, refuges) only partially
accommodate indigenous interests and can prohibit or
significantly restrict traditional activities. National Parks
are close in intent to a TTP. And new working rules for national
parks do accommodate the activities of indigenous peoples.
People in the Bikin, however, have reservations about a park:
The park administration has the authority to expand and restrict
traditional activities. How would an administration be
assembled? What criteria would this administration use to
resolve conflicts involving traditional activities? And the
working rules make no provision for existing local
self-management structures in park administration. That is why a
TTP in the Bikin is the optimal first step and represents the
beginning of a management process that will evolve as it
encounters new challenges. Many feel that portions of the Bikin
may indeed be suitable for inclusion in a national park system
and consider this an important issue for discussion as the
watershed's management process is developed.

WHO IS BOSS IN THE TAIGA?

by Anatolii Lebedev - In the two years the Tiger brigades of the
Krai Committee on Environmental Protection and Natural Resource
have been operating in Primor'e, rare is the 'taiga' person who
has yet to learn of the teams work. Though it might be a bit too
bold to say that these quick response teams have fundamentally
reversed the way hunters view the stripped taiga competitor,
changes are occurring. Long lasting changes, however, will take
years, will require a well planned economic and social strategy
on the part of administrators responsible for the taiga, and
most importantly, it will require endless amounts of enthusiasm
and bravery on the part of at least one person. Team leaders
have to take charge if the brigades are to be effective, and in
the case of Pozharskii Raion, where a brigade was created in
September of 1995, the person who took the lead in that region's
anti-poaching campaign was Aleksandr Rogachevskii, a chauffeur
for the Raion Committee on Environmental Protection and Natural
Resources. Sasha is the first to admit that during his special
training to prepare him for the lead role in that region's
anti-poaching project, the leader of the Tiger brigades,
Vladimir Shchetinin of the Krai Committee, warned his local
representative in the Bikin that he should be ready to encounter
a range of difficulties, including threats and all kinds of
rumors. But most importantly, the Krai Committee would be there
to support Sasha should things get rough. With this in mind,
Rogachevskii and his team set off to work the Raion. But by the
end of November, after detaining E. Shcherbin for poaching a
wild boar, the team leader got a taste of the danger to standing
up to local forces; his latest catch happened to be the personal
driver of Konstantin Voitseshevskii, the head of the Pozharskii
Raion administration. Sergei Gorborukov, chairperson of the
Raion Committee, was soon given an order to return the
confiscated license, and when he refused, the head of the
administration immediately raised the stakes by drawing in the
Krai Committee. Shchetinin was invited to Luchegorsk for a
visit. This is how Rogachevskii describes what followed:
"...Shchetinin pointed to our excellent work and at the same
time added that Voitseshevskii spared no effort in dumping all
over me. I felt the results right away: in December, Gorborukov,
Raion Committee Chairperson, did everything possible to hinder
the work of the brigade; he refused to provide a car to make
raids and constantly reminded us that the best thing to do would
be to cool our jets and cut off the raids until New Year's; this
to not enrage Voitseshevskii. We were forced to find
transportation any way we could. The chairperson reminded me at
every occasion that Voitseshevskii was moving to have me fired
from my job at the Committee..." "... In the end, Gorborukov
caved in and without any warning, a notice was sent to the Krai
Committee to release me from my job at the Raion Committee. All
this despite the fact that Gorborukov had no apparent problems
with my work. On December 28th he let me know that Mikhail
Bibikov, Chairperson of the Krai Committee, had no intention of
extending my contract. The explanation was simple: first, I had
been too zealous in my work, and secondly, Voitseshevskii had
been on the phone to Bibikov about the matter, and <a name=L10004></a><a href=#L10005>so</a> the
decision had been made..." Rogachevskii got nowhere when he went
to Vladivostok in an attempt to get at the 'truth' in the
matter. As stated in the Tiger brigade's charter, each team
member signs an annual contract. Or doesn't sign, for as they
say, it all depends upon the mood of the boss. This 'fact'
denies those in the line of fire any opportunity to appeal to a
union; the only avenue is to appeal to the courts. Only not
every Russian easily matures to an understanding of how the
courts work. For us, the children of an imperial government,
this democratic habit is something new. And for many in this
country, the hope for fair play has long since gone up in smoke.
And that's a real drag! Because in this instance, the case more
than deserved a hearing in court, though the chances are slight
that the issue would have been ruled in the favor of those
defenseless few trying to protect the environment. After a
couple of brief conversations with Shchetinin and Bibikov at the
Krai Committee, the evidence for Rogachevskii's down fall was
reveled: in trying to bring about some fair play in Pozharskii
Raion by nailing the Raion's chief administrator's personal
driver, the brigade leader got a bit too mouthy about what took
place. One has to admit that acting the tough guy puts officials
in an even tougher spot when it comes to defending the work of
subordinates. The question remains, however, why these officials
have been as equally silent about the massive effort to protect
the rights of a single poacher, when there is plenty of time to
talk about the way Rogachevskii behaved in his conflict with
Raion officials. And just what Voitseshevskii said to Bibikov
and Gorborukov about this obstinate inspector, or even if he
spoke to them at all, well, all this is a big secret. Krai
Committee officials deny any pressure from Voitseshevskii to
remove Rogachevskii. At the same time it disseminates a constant
flow of unsubstantiated and unfounded information about
Rogachevskii: how he supposedly didn't get along with his two
other colleagues; how he supposedly liked to drink on the job,
and in general, well.... No surprise here that these 'facts'
surfaced after the head of Pozharskii Raion took an active role
in trying to draw attention away his driver. Just try to make
public anything about Voitseshevskii, about his outrageous
behavior in the taiga, about his constant efforts to cover up
other highly placed poachers in the Raion or his threats and
blackmail. The restraints are obvious upon anyone dedicated to
enforcing environmental protection laws and defending the
environment. It is a sure bet that loud mouths are going to feel
it in the end. Even government inspector status is inadequate
protection from the long arm of local administrators. And firing
principled workers from the Pozharskii Raion Committee is not
something new. About a year and a half ago, Vasilii Maisak, the
head knocking chairperson of the Pozharskii Raion Committee got
shuffled out the door. And if it hadn't been for the personal
request of Maisak to not write anything about his sacking, this
article might have appeared back then. We are not just talking
about someone with principles getting the boot. What we have
going here is a general understanding of fairness, legality and
democracy. When someone gets 'twisted' by the system, then it is
first of all a tragedy for the person involved. A tragedy for
that person and for the people doing the twisting. The nation is
also victimized when officials trample the law to abuse those
righteously trying to protect the environment. When authorities
cover work to their own self interests, it is the interests of
the people that are betrayed, those very people who are trying
to serve the state in a fair and equitable way. Of course, the
work of an environmental protection inspector is never an easy
task when an impoverished nation pounds on the environment. All
the more when a portion of the fines levied against violators
make up the basic budget of the inspectors; the search for
'fines' become an end in and of itself and replaces the very
process of trying to promote environmental protection and
environmental awareness. Yes, to respect the offender is
important, just as it is vital that an effort be made to bring
each and every infraction to court. Only it is no secret who
gets justice in the Raion when it comes to charging a person
close to the head of the administration. And for those with a
golden nostalgia for former Party authority can rest assured:
there have been no serious changes in Russian life except for
the value of the rouble. In petitioning Pavel Sulyandziga,
Advisor to the Governor of Primorskii Krai on Indigenous
Affairs, Rogachevskii suggested that the Tiger brigades might be
more effective if support provided by international groups were
transferred to the Primorskii Krai Department of Hunting
Resources. The brigades would have some authority in the taiga,
including the right to conduct a search and to carry weapons,
powers that the Krai Committee can't provide. This really isn't
the point. Given a normal atmosphere in the Raion, one where its
authorities are first of all concerned about legal guarantees
and not the entertainment of its buddies, then there is a
reasonable chance that some semblance of order can be provided
in the taiga. Raids by the Tiger brigades are most often carried
out together with the police, wildlife managers, inspectors from
Primorskii Krai Marine Resource Department and Raion
Environmental Protection Committees. Nor is the point that
'contract' people need to have better employment guarantees,
though this is important. The point is that the environment
plays a major role in everyone's life these days, and the battle
is not <a name=L10005></a><a href=#L10006>so</a> much for tigers as it is for humans, for developing an
awareness of their role in the environment and the need for
authorities to be responsive to the law and the citizenry. If
authorities live by their own, individual laws, as was the case
for 80 years in Russia, they will sooner or later be swept away.
This will be a sad moment since one and all are interested in a
stable and trustworthy faith in authority. Given the complaints
about Voitseshevskii, people need to remember some recent Bikin
River watershed history. Back in 1993, when the Russian-South
Korean joint-venture "Svetlaya" geared up for a full scale
attack on the timber in the headwaters of the Bikin River
watershed, this with the full support of the Krai
administration, Voitseshevskii, along with many others in the
Raion, took a stand against the logging this gem of the RFE. The
most generous of promises from the South Korean partners did not
bend him and there is no doubt that his leadership on the issue
helped people to keep believe in the government. It showed
people that both the people and its leadership are the true care
takers of the taiga, and everyone together, the average hunter
and the top administrator in the Raion are responsible before
the environment. For the only way to live in peace and harmony
is the observance of the law before which all are equal.

Menschenrechte und Umweltbewegung In Russland

Der Fall Alexandr Nikitin

Am 6. Februar 1996 um 7 Uhr morgens wurde der russische
Umweltaktivist Alexandr Nikitin von fuenf Agenten des Foederalen
Sicherheitsdienstes FSB (einer der russischen Geheimdienste)
verhaftet. Wir berichteten bereits ausfuehrlich in Rundbrief Nr.
10 von 31.3.1996. Der Mitarbeiter des Murmansker Bueros der
norwegischen Umweltgruppe Bellona, der an der Untersuchung der
Umweltsituation in den militaerischen Einrichtungen der
russischen Nordmeerflotte beteiligt ist, wird der Spionage
beschuldigt. Nach dem russischen Strafrechts drohen Nikitin im
Falle der Verurteilung mindestens 10 Jahre Haft. Die
Hoechststrafe wuerde die Hinrichtung fuer Aleksandr Nikitin
bedeuten. Nikitin, dem in den ersten Monaten sogar die freie
Wahl eines Anwalts seines Vertrauens verweigert wurde, sitzt zur
Zeit in Isolationshaft. Im Folgenden eine Chronologie der
juengsten Entwicklungen und eine offizielle FSB-Presseerklaerung
ueber den Fall Nikitin:

St. Petersburg branch of the FSB arrested Alexandr Nikitin,
captain of 1st degree. The former marine officer is accused of
high treason by espionage, in accordance with paragraph 64 A of
Russian Criminal Law. Investigations have disclosed that
Alexandr Nikitin through his contact with Environmental
Foundation Bellona has delivered to Bellona secret and top
secret material concerning Russias nuclear fueled fleet for
payment. In this he used his contacts among marine officers. The
illegal activities Nikitin is accused of are beyond the scope of
what an environmental organisation should be concerned with, and
is provoking our countries defence ability. The case is placed
under the investigative branch of FSB in St. Petersburg. Nikitin
is held in isolated custody at the FSB at Liteynly 4.

Chronological overview

May 7 1996: Voiced by Ronald Rindestu, Norwegian County
Administrators raised the Nikitin-case with their collegues from
Murmansk and Arkhangelsk counties, during a meeting May 6 and 7
in the Barents Council. Rindestu asked what will happen to the
Lepse project, which was granted funds from the Barents Council
in 1994, and whether the council legally could continue to use
the Bellona report "The Russian North Fleet, Sources to
Radioactive Contamination" as background material, now that it
has been classified by the FSB.

May 6 1996: Members of the EU Parliament, Doeke Eisma, Carlos
Pimenta and Martine Gredler asked Parliamentary questions to the
European Commission on the Nikitin case today. Commission
spokesperson Mr. Sabba answered that the Commission is very
concerned with the treatment of NGOs in North West Russia.
Nikitin, said Sabba, as a Russian national, must be treated in
accordance with Russian law, but the Commision is following the
case. The Commission has been active in Murmansk in that it has
instituted the Lepse project, and the TACIS programme supports
many activities in the region. Delivering his speech in flowing
terms, Sabba seemed determined to show that the Commission had
taken all necessary action at the appropriate time. In the
following approx. one hour long debate, MEP Ken Collins
emphasised the human rights angle of the matter, and asked the
Commission whether they would bring up the case with the Council
of Europe.

May 2 1996: Letter from United States Department of State, John
E. Herbst Principal Deputy Coordinator, Russia and the Caucusus

April 30 1996: Ukraine: 19 environmental activists were arrested
after participating in an anti nuclear demonstration outside the
Ministerial Council in Kiev on April 23. Five of the activists
were taken directly to a court meeting, and were sentenced to
three to five days imprisonment. The five were Ira Korol, Nadia
Sherchenko, Vladimir Slivyak, Dima Tolomatsky and Sergey
Fomichev. They were not allowed to defend themselves in court,
nor to meet with a lawyer. The activists, gathered in Kiev for a
10 year memorial for the Tchernobyl accident, were released
after having started a hunger strike in the prison. Bellona
contact Alexey Klimov was visited by local FSB agents in
Severodvinsk today. Three copies of the Bellona report "The
Russian North Fleet - Sources of Radioactive Contamination" were
confiscated. The agents presented an official FSB order, stating
that distribution of the report within Russia is illegal,
because it contains state secrets. It is unlikely that the FSB
has authority to make such a decision.

April 26 1996: 11:45 local time four officers from FSB visited
Bellonas office in Murmansk. Kpt. Maksimenkov, head of the
investigation group, was among them. They informed that they
would perform a investigation experiment in accordance with
Russian code. They said that they did not need to get
permission, since they have a right to perform such experiments
in rooms of any juridical person on the territory of Russia.
After that, in a presence of Sergey Filippov and two witnesses,
FSB officers faxed two pages to the Bellona office in Oslo using
Bellonas faxmodem and faxmachine. Bellonas logo were on the
pages followed by meaningless characters. The officers
documented the time it took to send the faxes to Oslo. After
that, the experiment was over. The witnesses and Sergey Filippov
signed a protocol and then the FSB officers left Bellonas
office. 

April 24 1996: Both Bellona head Frederic Hauge and
environmental councel to President Jeltsin, A. Jablokov, raised
the Nikitin-case and the need for openness, during the hearing
about nuclear safety ten years after the Tchernobyl accident in
Brussels today. The hearing, arranged by Globe International and
Bellona, was open to EU MEPs and invited guests. Approx. 70
persons attended, most of them journalists.

(...)

April 22 1996: The Bellona office in Murmansk was searched by
agents from the FSB again today. Two local FSB officers and one
from St. Petersburg, with two witnesses in tow, told Bellona
employee Sergey Philippov to leave, as they wanted to talk to
Bellona secretary Luba Kovaleva. The agents did not provide IDs
or a search warrant, but on being prompted by Philippov answered
that they would carry out their task regardless. The agents
stayed at the office for an hour, checking telephone lines and
taking notes on technical issues from the fax and modem manuals.

April 21 1996: Moscow Nuclear Safety and Security Summit
Declaration (...).

April 20 1996: Canadian Prime Minister Chretien today expressed
his concerns for the Nikitin case, during a meeting with Russian
president Yeltsin. Chretien delivered a letter of concern to
Yeltsin, and said that Canada will follow the case thouroughly
and could gladly welcome Nikitin in case Russia finds him too
much of a problem.

New Scientist has an Editorial about the Nikitin-case: "In the
anarcy of the former soviet union, it is amazing what you can
find out by browsing through press clippings, government reports
and books by retired russian admirals. It is amuzing, but to the
FSB, the state security police, not amusing. Its officers have
arrested Alexandr Nikitin, one of the russian authors of the
report,(...) If the nuclear situation in the rest of Russia is
as bad as it is on the Arctic naval bases, the country needs
help. And it won't come from the state security police."

The NGO conference Moscow Nuclear Summit Watch supported the
case of Alexandr Nikitin with an appeal to President Yeltsin,
signed by co-chairmen Alexei Yablokov and Thomas Cochran.

April 18 1996: The new Bellona Report "The Russian North Fleet -
Sources of Radioactive Contamination" was released at a press
conference in Moscow today, the day before the G7+1 meeting on
nuclear safety in Moscow. It was his work on this report that
led to the arrest of Alexandr Nikitin. Whereas Bellona can prove
that all information in the report stems from open sources, the
FSB claims to have found state secrets in the material.

April 17 1996: (...) The group of investigators from FSB have
since April 16 been in Murmansk interrogating several people as
a part of their investigation in the Nikitin case. Two of the
people in Bellonas staff in Murmansk were interrogated once
more. They were also presented a document where they were asked
to sign a paper of security clearance in relation to the
interrogations they had to go through in the Nikitin case. The
staff members of Bellona refused to sign the paper. In addition
to this the FSB has interrogated several of the officers in the
North Fleet that have been in contact with Nikitin. It is not
known how long time the FSB agents were in Murmansk.

At a press conference the 17. April a Committee for defence of
Alexandr Nikitin was founded (...).

April 10 1996: Alexandr Nikitin was put on isolation today,
after having shared cell with two other prisoners at different
times. Alexandr is quite certain that both the two cellmates
were FSB agents. (...)

After going through most of the FSB evidence, Nikitin's lawyer
Jury Schmidt today ascertained that the FSB's case against
Nikitin is based on material in the upcoming report on the
Northern Fleet.

April 9 1996: Head of Bellona Murmansk and coauthor of the
upcoming report, Igor Kudrik, was threatened with a half year
imprisonment today, when he refused to answer certain questions
during interrogation without a lawyer present. He also refused
to sign a paper of security clearance. Kudrik fears he is next
on FSB's list of alleged environmentalist spies.

April 4 1996: Alexandr Nikitin shall be kept in custody two more
months awaiting his trial, ruled a Russian military court today.
The court rejected a request from the lawyer to release Nikitin
for bail until the trial is raised. The time of this trial is
uncertain. During the custody hearings, Nikitin was placed in a
cage guarded by six soldiers armed with machine-guns. The
lawyer, Yuri Schmidt, claims that the FSB are still breaking the
Russian Constitution in their handling of the case against
Alexandr Nikitin. The judge in the custody hearing pointed out
that the FSB had done a mistake in refusing Nikitin a lawyer.

March 29 1996: Alexandr Nikitin was allowed to meet his lawyer
Jury Schmidt today, in accordance with the constitutional court
which on Wednesday 27th ruled that the strict security measures
enforced by the FSB towards the lawyer are illegal. The meeting
took place in the FSB prison in St. Petersburg. The lawyer will
now be allowed access to the case documents prepared by the FSB
against Nikitin. The FSB refused a request from Nikitin's wife
Tatyana Tchernova, who applied to meet with her husband in
prison. According to Nikitin's lawyer Jury Schmidt, the refusal
is in violation of the law, and a complaint has been filed with
the State Prosecutor in St. Petersburg. Probably Tatyana will be
able to meet with her husband next week.

March 27 1996: The Constitutional Court today made the verdict
in favor of the complaints from Alexandr Nikitin and Bellona.
Alexandr Nikitin now has the right to freely choose his own
lawyer.

VLADIMIR PETRENKO BEGAN A HUNGER STRIKE

In Protest of the extreme human rights violations against him
the last several months Vladimir Petrenko (Shikhany, Saratov
Oblast) began a hunger strike on January 22nd.

BACKGROUND INFO (by The Center for Assistance to Environmental
Initiatives): Vladimir Petrenko served in the Soviet Army in the
early 1980s in Shikhany where he became a victim of chemical
weapons experiments. This led to a series of chronic illnesses
including lung and intestinal disorders, and also thyroid
disease. He received occupational disability status due to
having been sent to Chernobyl as part of a clean-up team. In
1991, the Command of Deputy and Environmental Activity illegally
laid off Petrenko for political reasons. He received no
compensation and was essentially blacklisted in Shikhany and
Volsk, making it difficult to feed his two small children. The
military officials refused to recognize that Petrenkos illnesses
were connected with his service. Only after two and a half
years, with the interference of the Supreme Council of Russia,
the Central Military-Physicians Commission granted Petrenko
invalid status. Petrenkos treatment was prevented by the
blockade on all information on the tests conducted on him. At
age 34, he was named an invalid with 25 chronic disorders.
Despite this, Petrenko was denied by the Court the admission of
the fact that the experiments had been conducted on him, and
thus he was denied compensation for emotional harm as well as
physical and psychological suffering, caused and subjected upon
him by the Command of the Shikhany Institute. Earlier Vladimir
Petrenko made known to the public the fact that experiments were
being conducted on people for the purpose of testing new classes
of chemical weapons. Because of this, he has experienced
numerous repressions on the part of the military. In the Centers
opinion, the fabricated evidence against Petrenko is now being
used as an attempt to discredit him in the eyes of the public.
The drawn-out investigation plus denying him his right to leave
the country, are both tactics to deprive Vladimir Petrenko the
opportunity to continue his environmental activity and to seek
assistance from human-rights organizations.

July 1995. Vladimir Petrenko filed a lawsuit against the
Shikhany Military Institute where he worked for many years and
where he was subjected to the chemical weapons experiments. A
decision was made on the federal level to grant Vladimir
financial compensation for the harm done to his health when sent
to Chernobyl to do clean-up. The Oblast Court refused to convict
the Institute of conducting inhuman tests using new chemical
weapons on Petrenko in 1982.

July 30, 1995. Vladimir's former colleague in the Shikhany
Institute insulted him and then came to blows. In defending
himself, Vladimir tryed to hold the man back, and the other guy
ended up with some bruises. Vladimir was convicted for
misbehavior and for committing bodily harm.

Oct 3, 1995. The Military Division 61469, where Vladimir
Petrenkos wife, Svetlana, has worked for the last 13 years,
demoted her for the third time in one year. Despite the pleas of
human rights organizations the Institute has announced that she
will be laid off as of March 1st, 1996.

Nov 4, 1995. Captain Kulev from Volsk-17 denied Petrenko his
right to leave the country. This was done in the absence of a
lawyer. Petrenko turns to the Volsk Special Prosecutor with
complaints about the violations being committed against him.

Dec 25, 1995. Petrenko receives a response stating that there
are ten days to complete a preliminary investigation of the
incriminated Petrenko, but nothing was mentioned of the other
violations.

Jan 19, 1996. Petrenko announced to Captain Kulev and sent
letters to the General Prosecutor of Russia, the Chair of the
Presidential Commission on Human Rights, Sergei Kovalev, and
other organizations, stating that if his petition stating his
objection to the preliminary investigation will not be satisfied
by 9:00 a.m. on January 22nd, he will start a hunger strike.

Jan 22, 1996. Kulev summoned Petrenko. Petrenko began a hunger
strike.

Today, Febr 1996, Vladimir is in the Saratov occupational
diseases clynic for a check-up holding on hunger strike. He
won't stop the hunger strike until his requests be satisfied.

"Vladimir Petrenko's Hunger Strike"

[From Express-Chronicle Newspaper, No. 5, February 2, 1996]
VOLSK-17 (SARATOV REGION). - Vladimir Petrenko's hunger strike
has continued into the tenth day. In the early 1980s Petrenko
served in Shikhany in the army, where he was the victim of
experiments with poisonous substances [chemical weapons]. On
July 3, 1995, a lawsuit on Petrenko's behalf was launched in
Saratov Regional Court against the Ministry of Defense, to
compensate him for damages to his health. At the conclusion of
the court investigation, a representative of the Ministry of
Defense insulted and struck Petrenko several times. Petrenko's
actions to defend himself (he restrained the officer's hands)
were ruled as "hooliganism", instigating a criminal case against
him under Article 206 of the Russian Criminal Code. Later he was
indicted under Article 112 ("Deliberate infliction of light
bodily injury") as well. As Petrenko's lawyer Vitalina Dmitrieva
reported in the January 31 issue of Express-Chronicle, his blood
pressure has badly fallen. In the past Petrenko participated in
military chemical experiments; he has status as a third-group
disabled person, and his lawyers fear that continuation of the
hunger strike could lead to irreversible consequences. Petrenko
began his hunger strike on January 22, demanding the removal of
a Mr. Kulev, an investigator with the local special police. The
investigator was not replaced, but in the course of several days
Petrenko's investigation was completed and the case transferred
to the Procurator [prosecutor], who must sign the indictment and
transfer the case back to court. Petrenko altered the terms of
his hunger strike, and is now demanding that the Saratov
Regional Procurator assume supervision of the case. (Since
Petrenko lives in Volsk-17, next to the Shikhansky military
site, supervision over his case is assigned to a Special
Procurator's Office. Petrenko considers the existence of the
Special Procurator's Office unconstitutional.) The lawyer V.
Dmitrieva reported that Petrenko is in no mood to compromise:
"He believes that unless he can bring himself back to good
health, no one will pay attention to his case." Translation:

"The Hunger Strike Protest Has Ended"

[From Zemlya Saratovskaya newspaper, February 16, 1996] - On
February 13 Vladimir Petrenko, co-chair of the regional Union
for Chemical Safety and the Russian Green Cross, ended his
hunger strike, begun on January 22 as a symbol of his protest
against the lack of legal limits observed by the Military
Special Procurator [Prosecutor] of the village of Shikhany.
Petrenko ended his hunger strike after a press conference in the
Russian-American Press Center organized by Greenpeace, Ecojuris,
the "Memorial" human rights center, the Socio-Ecological Union,
and the Moscow Legal Defense Center, on the topic of persecution
of environmentalists by the Russian authorities. One example of
this persecution is the Petrenko case. Representatives of
organizations taking part in the press conference sent a
telegram to Petrenko, persuading him to stop his hunger strike
(the telegram from Ecojuris in particular asserts that
Petrenko's health and strength will come in useful not only for
him but also for other people). Note: Ecojuris lawyers are
defending Vladimir Petrenko's case in Russian court.

Pollution in Pskov

PSKOV - The greatest source of pollution in the city is the
heavy metal spread from the smokestack of the Pskov factory of
radio components, according to a two-year investigation of the
environmental quality of life in Pskov completed in September.
Heavy metals were also found in high concentration in the city
dump. Auto and rail transport are most responsible for oil-based
pollution. An ecological map of Pskov and a computer database
are to be established based on the results. (Novosti Pskova, 27
Dec.)

PSKOV OBLAST- The construction of a coal-processing plant on the
territory of the Kalinin Kholkhoz, near the village of Zaguzy,
and also the construction of a temporary electrostation on
Iubileinii and Palkinskii Highways, have been temporarily
blocked. The reason for the halt in construction of both
projects is the absence of an ecological investigation in
project documentation. (Pskovskaia Pravda, 26 Dec.)

Traffic in Moscow

On December 23, Activists of "Rainbow Keepers" environmental
group were blocking some cars with cutted trees near Sadovoe
Koltso, center of the Moscow, where nobody can cut anything
green (tree or something else) by the act of Moscow government.
But worldwide known opera songer Ms. Vishnevskaya can cut this
trees to construct there opera schools (Moscow government,
forgetting first act, gave her the permission to cut by another
act). 4 activists were arrested, trial coming soon. Boycott
Vishnevskaya' opera concerts!

St.Petersburg -A Recycling Project For Aluminium Cans

has been presented by the environmental center ECAT. The
introduction of aluminum soft drink cans by foreign producers
has led to a sharp rise in the percentage of aluminum cans in
the city garbage. No recycling program for those cans exists in
the city today. Aluminum cans are now bought only abroad, at the
cost of 12 to 15 cents (U.S.) per can. A recycling program would
allow those cans to be produced in the Petersburg area.

INTERNATIONAL PETITION FOR A NUCLEAR FREE FUTURE

Dear Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary General of the United
Nations:

In 1996, in the tenth year following the Chernobyl disaster, we
wish to draw your attention to our concern for a nuclear free
world for the future generations. We the undersigned support
following demands:

Stop the promotional and technological functions of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concerning nuclear
energy. The IAEA should be a purely control agency that gives
NGO's participation in policy making.

Create a new International Energy Agency under the U.N. for
research and promotion of renewable energy.

We hope Mr. Secretary General that you will undertake
initiatives to implement these demands as soon as possible.

Name,Address, etc.....

IAEA Says 438 Nuke Plants Operating Worldwide

Vienna (Reuter) 07.05.96 - Five new nuclear power plants came
into operation since 1994 and a mothballed plant in Armenia came
back on stream, bringing the total number around the world to
438, the United Nations nuclear agency said Thursday. Four new
reactors with a combined capacity of 3,290 megawatts of
electricity were connected last year to power grids in India,
South Korea, Britain and Ukraine, the Vienna-based International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said. In addition, Romania opened a
Canadian-built reactor at Cernavoda on the Danube 170 km (105
miles) east of Bucharest in April, the IAEA told Reuters.
"Cernavoda was launched by the Canadian prime minister (Jean
Chretien) and the Romanian authorities last week, just before
the anniversary of Chernobyl (on April 26)," said IAEA spokesman
David Kyd. "It is not yet in commercial use, but it is up and
running," Kyd said. Cernavoda is the first Western-designed
nuclear power plant in Eastern Europe. Romania's power authority
Renel said Cernavoda would begin generating commercial
quantities of electricity in the fourth quarter of 1996. An
Armenian plant at Medsamor was reconnected to the local
electricity grid in 1995 after being shut down following a
devastating earthquake in 1988, Kyd said. Two nuclear reactors
were shut down in 1995, one in Canada and one in Germany. "That
would bring us up to 31 countries with operating reactors," he
said. The IAEA said 38 nuclear power plants were currently under
construction in 14 countries, including five in Ukraine, five in
South Korea, four in Russia and four in India. The United States
runs the greatest number of nuclear power plants with 109 in
operation. France comes second with 56, followed by Japan with
51. Ukraine, site of the world's worst nuclear accident at the
Chernobyl plant in 1986, has 16 reactors in operation. The IAEA
said 17 countries relied on nuclear power plants to supply at
least a quarter of their electricity needs, but in some areas of
Europe it was significantly higher. Nuclear power's share of
electricity production was highest in Lithuania at 85.59
percent, followed by 76.14 percent in France and 55.52 percent
in Belgium. The share dropped to slightly below half in Sweden
at 46.61 percent, 46.43 percent in Bulgaria, 44.14 percent in
Slovakia and 42.30 percent in Hungary. The IAEA said the total
nuclear power generation around the globe rose to 2,227.94
terawatt-hours, more than the world's total electricity
generation from all sources in 1958. Overall, nuclear power
plants provided about 17 percent of the world's electricity
production in 1995.

Belene in Bulgarien

In 1990 the construction of the Belene NPP was frozen mainly
because of two reasons: the official statement of the experts
from the Bulgarian Academy of Science, which pointed out the
full inexpediency of the Belene NPP in many aspects like seismic
insecurity of the ground of the plant; negative environmental
impact in the region; economic ineffectiveness, and secondly the
pressure of the public against this construction. Now five years
later the public opinion is prepared to accept Belene as the
only possible solution for its energy future. All popular
newspapers in Bulgaria present interviews and statements of
experts in which they explains how secure and clean the nuclear
industry is and how close we are to the energy crisis, which can
be avoided only with new nuclear energy capacities. Government
officials speak of Belene as an unquestionable fact. In the
mostly watched TV program "Observer" a famous journalist
presented 30 minutes videofilm about the Kozloduy NPP. He walks
inside the plant, asks questions and always receives the same
answer - everything is very secure and there is no radiation and
no danger about the health of the people. <a name=L10007></a><a href=#L10008>So</a> through the media
the public opinion is step by step focused on the unescapable
need of Belene. The new Energy Strategy for the development of
Bulgaria till 2010 has been recently proposed in the Parliament.
The main new energy capacity building option in this strategy is
the construction of Belene. The PM Widenov explained in the
parliament what the plans of the government are about the
construction of Belene. He said that until 2000 Belene is not an
alternative for the government. This period will be used for
technical investigation, licensing of the building site and
financial investigation (possibilities for exporting electricity
should be analyzed in this investigation). There is not an
alternative Energy Strategy proposed in the Parliament to be
discussed. There are some specific arguments against the
construction of Belene, which make the plant very dangerous and
problematic: 

the seismic insecurity of the building site. The common seismic
activity of the region is assessed at 8 degree (MSK) this is the
maximum degree estimated for the construction of a NPP. <a name=L10008></a><a href=#L10009>So</a> the
position of the building site does not give the necessary needed
seismic reserve.

because of his specific position Belene would have a high
negative impact on the environment in the region, which is clear
proved in the Bulgarian scientist statement. For example climate
change; destruction of the water balance; possible pollution of
the underground water; cancer decease as result from the
combined impact of the radioactivity and chemical plant in the
town.

economic inefficiency and the real possibilities for Bulgaria to
build its energy capacity without using nuclear energy. Several
environmental groups decided to make the public aware of this
arguments.

People from the NGOs do not believe that we can change something
with our campaign and they are not motivated to participate. <a name=L10009></a><a href=#L10010>So</a>
we need to attract and motivate more people for our campaign. We
should connect the media and the experts, <a name=L10010></a><a href=#L10011>so</a> that the experts
opinion can be heard by the public. In this way the people will
accept more seriously our actions. We should organize a public
discussions about Belene with all objective arguments "for" and
"against" the construction. we are preparing a video film which
can be presented by the tv and distributed in the country. Our
main goal is to overcome the human disbelief and lack of
information and force them to participate actively in such
decision like the construction of a new NPP. How is it possible
to achieve this?

Mochovce in der Slowakei

Premierminister Vladimir Meciar, der starke Mann der Slowakei,
verkuendete, dass der erste Block des umstrittenen Reaktors im
Juni 1998 in Betrieb gehen werde. Ende April erteilte die
Slowakei einen Auftrag ueber die Lieferung von Leittechnik an
Siemens. Aehnlich wie bei der Inbetriebnahme des ersten
rumaenischen AKW Cernavoda wartete man also geschickt den Trubel
rund um den Tschernobyl-Jahrestag ab, damit die Nachricht in der
Flut anderer Atom-Artikel untergeht. Auftragssumme: 153
Millionen DM, finanziert zu 85 Prozent von der Kreditanstalt
fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) in Frankfurt / Main. Die KfW ist eine
oeffentliche Bank, sie gehoert zu 80 Prozent dem Bund und zu 20
Prozent den Laendern. Die KfW will den Kredit nur geben, wenn
Siemens dafuer eine Hermes-Buergschaft der Bundesregierung als
Absicherung bekommt (dieser war Anfang Mai noch nicht
beschlossen). Der Bank reicht es also nicht, dass die
slowakische Regierung vor zwei Monaten das Haftungsrisiko fuer
moegliche Unfaelle uebernahm (das war aber fuer Siemens wichtig,
denn bei einem GAU in der Slowakei will man nicht haftbar
gemacht werden). Ein weiterer Auftrag von 84 Millionen DM ging
an die Franzosen (Framatome). Zusammen mit dem Siemens-Anteil
gibt es also fuer Sicherheitsmassnahmen 237 Millionen Mark.
Insgesamt soll das AKW Mochovce jetzt nur noch rund eine
Milliarde DM kosten. Letztes Jahr waren es noch 1,5 Milliarden.
Ein Viertel der Auftragssumme geht also an EUCOM (European
Consortium Mochovce), das Gemeinschaftsunternehmen von Siemens
und Framatome, rund ein Zehntel nach Russland, aber der
Loewenanteil an tschechische (Skoda) und slowakische
Unternehmen. Juraj Krivosik vom slowakischen Umweltverband "Za
matku zem" haelt Widerstand noch fuer sinnvoll, weil die
tschechischen Banken als Hauptfinanziers von Mochovce bislang
nur etwas mehr als die Haelfte der Finanzierung vertraglich
zugesichert haben.

Osteuropabank profiliert sich zunehmend als Atombank 
von Valentin Thurn 

Falls Tschernobyl im Jahr 2000 wirklich
abgeschaltet wird, dann soll Ersatz im Wesentlichen aus zwei
anderen Atomkraftwerken kommen. Das beschlossen die
Regierungschefs des Westens letzte Woche in Moskau - nicht ganz
uneigennuetzig. Denn die beiden halbfertigen Reaktoren in Riwne
und Chmelnitzki sollen von der westlichen Atomindustrie
komplettiert werden. Andere Alternativen wie etwa Gas- und
Dampfkraftwerke wurden abgelehnt, angeblich weil sie teurer
sind. Doch die "Leastcost-Studie", die dies ermittelte, halten
nicht nur Atomkraftgegner fuer zweifelhaft. Mitarbeiter der
Europaeischen Bank fuer Wiederaufbau und Entwicklung (EBWE), der
bei der Finanzierung die Schluesselrolle zukommt, berichten von
"Manipulationen". Die Atomkraft-Option sei schoengerechnet, dem
Gutachter von der deutschen consulting "Lahmeyer International"
seien die oekonomischen Eckdaten bereits vorgegeben worden. "Die
Studie sollte nur noch rechtfertigen, was ohnehin schon
entschieden war", kritisiert ein Bankmitarbeiter, der anonym
bleiben will. Unrealistisch hoch sei zum Beispiel die
Stromverbrauchs-Prognose, viel zu niedrig die Schaetzung der
notwendigen Investionen. Auf der EBWE-Jahrestagung, die
ebenfalls letzte Woche in Sofia stattfand, musste
Bank-Praesident Jacques de Larosi_re eine Nachbesserung der
duennen Wirtschaftlichkeitsstudie versprechen, nachdem diese
sogar im Bank-Gouverneursrat kritisiert worden war. Die EBWE
soll nicht nur der wichigste Kreditgeber werden, sie ueberprueft
auch im Auftrag von Euratom und G 7. Gemauschelt wurde bereits
im letzten Jahr beim ersten Atomkraftprojekt der Bank: Mochovce
in der Slowakei. Auch hier liess die Bank von einem
unabhaengigen Gutachter die kostenguenstigste Loesung ermitteln.
Doch das Ergebnis des Gutachtens der Consulting-Firma "Putnam,
Hayes & Bartlett" ueberraschte die Banker: Die nukleare Option
sei keineswegs billiger als der Neubau eines Gas- und
Dampfkraftwerkes, und das, obwohl Mochovce bereits zu drei
Vierteln fertiggebaut ist. Doch Gas hat einen entscheidenden
Nachteil: Der Westen verdient nichts daran, denn es kommt aus
Russland. Das Ergebnis passte der franzoesischen Atomlobby
ueberhaupt nicht in den Kram, schliesslich war Mochovce ein
fetter Auftrag. Sie setzte ihre Truppen in Bewegung: Der damals
verantwortliche Teamleiter in der Bank, der englische
Energieoekonom Martin Blaiklock, wurde in die Zange genommen:
"Der Praesident setze zwei Franzosen ueber mir ein und zwei
Franzosen unter mir, um mich unter Kontrolle zu halten." Die
Studie mit dem "falschen Ergebnis" wurde nie veroeffentlicht.
Naechster Schritt: Der Gutachter von "Putnam, Hayes & Bartlett"
wurde angewiesen, die Studie umzuschreiben, und zwar nach den
Vorgaben der Bank. Die Consulting-Firma sah sich gezwungen, dem
Wunsch des Auftraggebers zu entsprechen, hielt allerdings auf
Anraten ihrer Rechtsanwaelte die Veraenderung der Grundannahmen
in einer Fussnote fest. <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>So</a> wurde der Zinssatz fuer Bankkredite
von 12 auf unrealistische 10 Prozent gesenkt, und die
Gaspreis-Prognose angehoben. "Das Ergebnis stand von vornherein
fest", urteilt Blaiklock: Nach der revidierten Studie war die
Atomkraft-Option rund fuenf Prozent billiger. Das war 1994.
Damit war die "Wirtschaftlichkeit" von Mochovce bewiesen, das
Projekt konnte starten. Dass im September 1995 die EBWE dann
doch noch aus der Finanzierung von Mochovce ausstieg, lag am
Protest einiger EBWE-Mitgliedslaender. Offene Gegnerschaft
zeigten zwar nur kleine Staaten wie Oesterreich, aber auch der
groesste EBWE-Geldgeber, die USA, hat das Vorgehen intern
kritisiert, allerdings wesentlich diskreter als die
Oesterreicher. Erst jetzt, ueber ein halbes Jahr spaeter,
dringen Einzelheiten ans Licht der Oeffentlichkeit. <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>So</a> uebernahm
eine franzoesische Seilschaft durch regelrechtes Mobbing die
Macht in der Energieabteilung und ekelte den Chef der Abteilung,
Martin Blaiklock, aus der Bank. Blaiklock ist kein
Atomkraftgegner, doch er wehrte sich gegen die unserioesen
Methoden einer gut organisierten Interessengruppe: Der
franzoesischen Atomlobby. Ganz besonders aergert sich der
ehemalige Banker darueber, dass die Bank zur gleichen Zeit ein
Energiesparprojekt in der Slowakei ablehnte. "Ich weiss bis
heute nicht, warum die Bankspitze dieses Projekt abgelehnt hat",
<a name=L10003></a><a href=#L10004>so</a> Blaicklock, "alle Zahlen stimmten, und unsere Abteilung hat
das Projekt fuer gut befunden." Seine Vermutung: Es stand in
direkter Konkurrenz zum Atomkraft-Projekt Mochovce. Die Weltbank
laesst die Finger von Atomkraftprojekten, sie haelt sie fuer
unwirtschaftlich. Die EBWE hingegen profiliert sich zunehmend
als "Atombank". Die Umweltlobbyisten von CEE-Bankwatch
kritisieren, die Bank nutze ihren 350 Millionen Mark schweren
Nuklearen Sicherheitsfonds dazu, das Leben unsicherer
Sowjetreaktoren noch zu verlaengern. Bankwatch-Sprecher Tomasz
Terlecki: "Der Fonds wurde gegruendet, damit alte Reaktoren in
Osteuropa stillgelegt werden. Haben Sie gesehen, dass ein
einziger stillgelegt wurde? Ich nicht."

KRSKO in SLOwENIen: ENVIRONMENTALISTS SEEK PLANT CLOSURE.

by Stan Markotich (Reuters) 21.03.96 - Slovenia's Ecological
Movement, supported by Greenpeace, began to collect petition
signatures on 19 March in a bid to try to force the government
to close down the country's only nuclear plant, Krsko. If 40,000
signatures are collected by 17 May, the environmentalists will
be able to force a referendum on the plant's closure. One
Greenpeace representative observed: "In 10 years Slovenia would
be able to replace the energy which is produced by the nuclear
plant, mainly by new small gas and hydro power plants and by
household efficiency programmes." Last year neighboring Croatia
said it would give up its claims to the plant and its resources
and not protest its closure on condition that Zagreb is fully
compensated. Efforts in 1995 in the Slovenian legislature to
close the plant failed due to lack of support.

Ignalina in Litauen: Nuclear Power plant worries Nordic
neighbours

By Ed Stoddard Vilnius, April 25 (Reuter) - Lithuania's Ignalina
nuclear power plant, the home of two Chernobyl-typereactors, is
a major source of concern to the Baltic state's Nordic
neighbours who are striving to prevent anothernuclear disaster.
Ignalina supplies around 80 percent of Lithuania's electricity,
making the small Baltic state the most nuclearpower dependent
country in the world. "There is a general level of concern in
the Nordic countries about the possibility of an accident at
Ignalina,"said one Scandinavian diplomat in Lithuania. Four
reactors were originally planned for Ignalina, but construction
on the third was halted in 1987 bymassive public protests in the
wake of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Ten years after the
accident, Western donors and experts are racing to prevent a
repeat of the disaster at Ignalina, located 120 km (75 miles)
north-east of the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. The Swedish
government has allocated over $30 million and the G7's Nuclear
Safety Account (NSA) hasearmarked over 32 million ECU ($39.4
million) to enhance technical and occupational safety at the
plant. "We think this is money well spent," Stellan Ottosson,
Sweden's ambassador to Lithuania, told Reuters. The NSA grant,
which is administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (EBRD), isbeing used to install new reactor trip
signals, fire protection devices, environmental monitoring
equipment and atraining simulator. "When all of the safety
projects at Ignalina are completed, the probability of an
accident occuring there will bethe same as any atomic energy
plant in the West," said Jan Nistad, the Director of the Swedish
InternationalProject for Nuclear Safety. Under the terms of the
Lithuanian government's agreement with the EBRD and the Group of
Seven (G7)major industrialised countries, Ignalina will be
permanently closed in 15 to 20 years time, when the
reactorchannels will require replacement. The plant will also be
subjected to an in-depth safety analysis by Western experts.
Unit-1 could be closed asearly as mid-1998 if it fails to make
the grade. But there are still concerns about the plant's safety
as it does not have a total containment system, Nistadsaid.
"While the probability of a serious accident at Ignalina is
small, if an accident does occur outside the primarycircuit,
there is nothing to prevent the radiation from being released
into the atmosphere, he said. Security and occupational problems
are of even greater concern than the plant's flawed technical
design. Security fears were heightened in November of 1994, when
German intelligence warned Lithuanianauthorities that the plant
was a possibile target for "terrorists." The plant was shut for
three days and scoured with bomb-sniffing dogs from Sweden.
Human error is also common among Ignalina's Soviet trained
staff. "The plant's biggest problem is that itlacks a culture of
safety," Nistad said. Last August, two cranes became entangled
while replacing fuel rods in the second reactor bloc. Several
dayslater, a 150 kg (330 lb) fuel rod broke while spent
radioactive fuel was being lowered into a waste pool and itsank
to the bottom. In mid-November, a fire broke out in a turbine
room. Two weeks later, one of the plant's engineers wasexposed
to a year's permitted dosage of radiation during a routine
calibration measurement of neutron flowdetectors. "The plant
should be closed soon," said Linas Vainius, the head of the
Lithuanian Green movement. "There is no independent monitoring
of radiation levels around the plant," he added.

Mayak im Suedural: Russia fears new danger from Urals nuclear
plant

By Andrei Khalip Moscow, May 5 (Reuter) - Russia needs to spend
large sums of money urgently to prevent new accidents and
pollution in the southern Urals from the country's only nuclear
fuel reprocessing plant, senior government officials said on
Sunday. "At the moment, and with the money that we have, we
cannot guarantee the safety of the people living downstream on
the River Techa," Yevgeny Drozhko, deputy head of the Mayak
plant told a government commission. The Mayak plant, often
dubbed "Russia's clockwork bomb" by environmentalists, suffered
a series of accidents in 1949, 1957 and 1967 which were hushed
up by the Soviet government. Drozhko said the plant, in the
Chelyabinsk region, desperately needed cash to prevent future
major disasters. "The only money we can get ourselves comes from
former communist states with whom we have contracts for
processing their nuclear waste. But this is not enough," Drozhko
said. First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets chaired the
commission meeting which was attended by reporters. He slammed
plant and government officials for delays in cleaning up after
previous accidents and in providing more safety. "They have not
fulfilled their jobs properly and allowed the situation to
become critical," Soskovets said, adding that there would be a
"tough government decision" on the issue. Deputy Emergency
Situations Minister Viktor Vladimirov said the overall amount of
dumped radioactive materials in the plant's neigbourhood had
exceeded dozens of times the amount of radiation spewed out in
the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. "Accidents at the plant in
the past and permanent dumping of liquid nuclear waste in the
neighbouring environment have led to a more dangerous situation
than in Russian territories which were affected by the Chernobyl
disaster," he said. Vladimirov said more than 60,000 people were
evacuated after the Mayak accidents, while about 900 were
suffering from severe doses of radiation. However, many
scientists and environmentalists say the full effects of the
accidents remain uncertain because victims were evacuated to
remote parts of the Soviet Union and no records have been kept
of most of them since then. Vladimirov said less than 15 percent
of the planned compensation to people living near the plant had
been paid <a name=L10004></a><a href=#L10005>so</a> far under a government programme to rehabilitate
the region. Less than four percent of the total money targeted
for the region by the programme had been paid. Drozhko said the
plant needed to seal with concrete the polluted Karachai lake
and build a dam to prevent water spilling from the plant's
reservoirs and flooding the River Techa. Another top priority is
building a new plutonium storage area to replace an ageing
building. "If this old storage gets damaged, we may have another
disaster similar to those in 1957 or 1967," Drozhko said. The
U.S. is currently involved in construction of a storage area
near Mayak, paying half of the $300 million cost. Vladimirov
said another solution for Mayak's problems could be finishing
construction of the South Urals nuclear power plant, which would
use some of the stored radioactive material. Soskovets said the
government would soon adopt a new programme, up to the year
2000, to clean up the areas contaminated by the accidents and by
dumping of waste in the region.

Chernobyl legacy hovers over nuclear fleet

By Philippa Fletcher, Bolshoi Kamen, Russia, April 25 (Reuter)
Eight months before Chernobyl, an explosion on a
nuclearsubmarine moored off Russia's Far East coast offered a
grim foretaste of the disaster to come. "The lid of the reactor,
weighing several tonnes, flew hundreds of metres and the 10
people working in thereactor compartment disappeared," wrote
Rear Admiral Nikolai Mormul in a book on atomic submarine
history. "They only found body parts in the bay a day later."
Joshua Handler of the environmental organisation Greenpeace said
naval sources had described it to him even more graphically.
"They were wiped around the reactor room like butter, was how
they put it. They had to bury the pieces inlead-lined caskets,"
he said. Mormul said a wall of secrecy was immediately thrown up
around the August 10, 1985, blast, muffling the bitter lesson it
carried for the Chernobyl workers who caused their reactor's
explosion through a strikingly similar human error. The cover-up
meant compensation for those involved in the clean-up was out of
the question. All they gotwere chits for new clothes which said
they had been there when "the bang" happened, Mormul wrote. Ten
years later the ruined submarine is still sitting in the bay at
Chazma, one of three which the Pacific Fleetsays are in an
"emergency state." But safety seems low on the list of concerns
of the people of Bolshoi Kamen, home to the Zvezda nuclear
submarine repair and decommissioning plant near the site of the
explosion at Chazma Bay, on the Pacific coastopposite the port
city of Vladivostok. The people in this town, where Zvezda is
the main employer, have more immediate worries. "We don't get
paid for months on end," said Pavel Vasilev, who said he had
worked at the plant for 13 years."We've only just got our money
for November and December." Vera Andreyevna, who supports
working relatives from her 362,000 rouble ($70) monthly pension,
said the worst thing was the power cuts, imposed partly because
the plant, which the authorities are not allowed to cutoff,
cannot pay its bills. A woman selling ice cream in a late spring
snow shower in Bolshoi Kamen last week said this was the only
way she could make ends meet. "What do we do? We steal," said a
man who refused to give his name. Zvezda, once part of an elite
network of secretive defence plants, is surrounded by villages
and abandoned military bases formerly known only by numbers. A
sign still stands at the entrance to the town saying that
foreigners are forbidden. Half-built blocks of flatsmarked "70
years since the (1917) October revolution" bear witness to a
Cold War defence boom frozen in itstracks by reforms. Locals,
who still pick mushrooms in the contaminated zone where the
reactor exploded, are sanguine aboutthe risk of another,
repeating the message from managers of the plant about strict
checks and controls. Valery Denilyan, head of the Pacific
Fleet's chemical defence service, is more worried about the
dailyheadache of dealing with 50 old submarines due to be
scrapped by 2010 than the risk of a new explosion. "In the last
10 years nothing like that has happened...but as long as you
have nuclear submarines you cannever say there will not be an
accident," he said. "There are a lot of problems here. There are
no finances and then we've got the serious problem of the
spentfuel. It is the most dangerous." Handler, who has written a
detailed technical report on the environmental hazards of the
Pacific Fleet, saidthere could be another big blast if a mistake
was made in removing the fuel from an old submarine whose
corelife was not used up. "Another Chazma is possible if some
underpaid guys are not paying attention or someone is in a
hurry," hesaid. While there has not been an accident as bad as
Chazma in the past decade, some hair raising things havehappened
in the region. In 1994 debris from shells and rockets fell on
Bolshoi Kamen after an off-duty guard at a nearby arms depotset
off an explosion by trying to dismantle an electrical component
from a missile with a knife. A year later, the workers at
Bolshoi Kamen blocked a new generation nuclear submarine in the
plant inprotest at delays in pay. They were persuaded to let it
go and the workers now appear in no mood to repeat their action,
clinging to thehope that if they continue to work they will
eventually get paid. "We went on strike for about 10 days and
they cancelled our annual bonus," said Valentin, who refused
togive his surname for fear he would be fired. "There's nowhere
else for us to go." He said his efforts were focused on trying
to get money for his son's studies <a name=L10005></a><a href=#L10006>so</a> he could avoid going into
thearmy. "What is there for him to fight for? "There's nothing
worth defending any more," he said.

10 Jahre nach Tschernobyl

FLOOD WILL WASH CHERNOBYL FALLOUT INTO DRINKING WATER

(Translation of a page 1 article in the Ukrainian Parliament's
newspaper "Voice of Ukraine" (Holos Ukrayiny), March 16, 1996,
entitled "Invisible Enemy Must Not Become Allied with Great
Water", Translated by Jonathan Spaulding, press coordinator
"Lessons of Chernobyl" Conference). Kiev  - What level of
flooding is expected in the Chernobyl Zone? Will it cause a
radiation safety hazard? This is what what discussed at a
meeting of the Standing Government Committee on
Technogenic-Ecological Safety and Emergency Situations, held at
Ukrainian Civil Defense headquarters. The chairman of the
Chernobyl Zone Flood Commission Mr. Stepanenko stated that the
situation on the Pripyat River is under control.The river basin
and the water safety structures at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power
Plant have been checked out.The Ukrainian State Meteorological
Scientific Research Institute and the Institute of Cybernetics
of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences have generated an
assessment of the expected radioactive contamination of the
Dnepro River water system during the period of Spring
flooding.According to this prognosis, the peak of the flood is
expected in the last ten days of April through the first ten
days of May.The peak flow of water near Chernobyl may reach 2150
cubic meters per second. Oleg Voytsekhovich, who is deputy
director of the above-mentioned meteorological institute was
asked to comment on the significance of this prognosis, and this
is what he said: "After the Chernobyl accident most of the
radioactive contamination remained in the area around the plant,
which is in the Pripyat River watershed.Here there is a
concentration of 40,000 to 50,000 curies of strontium-90 and
approximately 70,000 curies of radioactive cesium. Efforts to
prevent floodwaters from washing this contamination into the
river were begun as early as 1988.The most highly polluted area
is contained by a dam, which was built in 1993 on the left bank
of the Pripyat.This bridge can not be washed away by the
expected flood this Spring.But on the right bank the water
protection projects have not been completed, and this leaves an
area that is contaminated by 1500-1600 Cu of strontium-90
unprotected from Spring flooding.This could lead to the washing
of radioactive elements into the Kiev Reservior, and further
south along course of the Dnipro River.This is what is causing
the concern." (The Dnipro River provides drinking water for
approximately 70% of Ukraine's population.- translator's note).
The beginning of significant flooding is expected in early
April.The situation is made more complicated by the fact that
below-freezing temperatures have been holding firm, and
therefore in all likelihood the timing of the flood will be
around ten days later than initially predicted. <a name=L10006></a><a href=#L10007>So</a> two possible
scenarios have been generated.Today the level of contamination
in the water around Kiev-Vyshgorod is around 5-6
picocuries/liter.In the first (more-likely) scenario the level
of pollution during the peak of the flood will not go above 20
pico-curies/liter.This is the maximum allowable level as set by
Ukrainian Ministry of Health for strontium. However, if the
Spring thaw comes more quickly the flooding may be more
severe.This is the situation envisioned in the second scenario,
which has an estimated 10% chance of occuring.In this scenario
the maximum level of strontium contamination of the Pripyat
River in the region of Chernobyl may reach 70-100
pico-curies/liter, and of the Dnipro River nearer Kiev - 30
pico-curies/liter.This later figure would be 1.5 times higher
than the allowable level. Is there danger in these figures?
According to both international and Ukrainian standards for
radiation safety, the allowable level for temporary
concentrations of strontium in drinking water is 100
pico-curies/liter, <a name=L10007></a><a href=#L10008>so</a> even in the worse-case scenario the
standards will not be violated. The situation may be made worse
by ice on the Pripyat River, which is in some places 1.2 meters
in thickness.Ice blocks are likely to cause flooding of the
river's tributaries.So ice-breaking equipment has been sent
there to clear the riverway if required for safety reasons. The
conclusion can be drawn that even in the worst-case-scenario
situation will not cause any significant threat from the point
of view of radiation safety. But the situation does show that
the Zone remains a source of pollution, and it is necessary to
continue efforts aimed at its further minimization.

Fires by Chernobyl raise Ukraine and Belarus radiation

By Larisa Sayenko Minsk, April 24 (Reuter) - Fires in grassland
near the stricken Chernobyl nuclear power station haveincreased
radiation levels in districts in both Ukraine and Belarus,
officials in both countries said onWednesday. Igor Rolevich,
Belarus's Deputy Emergency Situations Minister, told Reuters the
fires, which broke out onlydays before the 10th anniversary of
the disaster at the plant, had been brought under control. But
higher radiation readings persisted along a stretch of land
within and adjacent to the 30-km (18-mile)exclusion zone
surrounding the plant and were linked to flames, smoke and
displacement of highly radioactivedust. "Yesterday was a public
holiday and people in the region lit candles and bonfires. There
were five bases offire, two of them in the Belarussian part of
the Chernobyl exclusion zone," Rolevich said. "All fires have
been brought under control. But this had an effect on background
radiation, with increasesregistered over a 10 to 20 km (six to
12 mile) stretch. There is no real effect on inhabited
territory." Belarussian radio said 400 houses had been destroyed
by fire in the zone, evacuated by Soviet authoritiesafter the
explosion at the Chernobyl plant on April 26, 1986. Downwind
from the conflagration, Belarus was worst affected by
radioactivity from the Chernobyl accident,receiving 70 percent
of the fallout. Up to a quarter of its territory was
contaminated and President Alexander Lukashenko last week toured
worst-affected regions by helicopter. Nearly 300,000 people were
hurriedly moved out of about 500 towns and villages on both
sides of the border after the disaster, many told they were
leaving for only three days. Up to 1,000 people have since
returneddespite a government ban. Environmental groups said the
latest fires posed a major threat as winds could carry radiation
well outsidethe zone. In Kiev, Ukraine's Chernobyl affairs
minister Volodymyr Kholosha said radiation increases had been
notedonly in isolated areas within a few hundred metres (300
yards) of where fires raced through a string of villageson
Tuesday. He said the fires had probably been caused by residents
on annual visits to the homes they hurriedly evacuated in the
aftermath of the disaster 10 years ago. Distraught villagers
watched in horror as their derelict homes were reduced to ashes
within 15 minutes. "The reasons for the fires are being
investigated but the most likely explanation is carelessness by
thesevisitors. By evening all fires were brought under control
and extinguished," Kholosha said. "There was no danger to the
Chernobyl station as the fire did not approach it. There was no
overall change inradiation levels. Increases were noted in the
area immediately around the fires, but only within several
hundredmetres." Radiation meters carried by firefighters showed
steep increases caused by fires, smoke and displacementof dust.
Kholosha said the fires, which raced through five villages in
the highly contaminated zone, had burned outmore than 150
hectares (375 acres) of forest and grass. Derelict homes and
other wooden buildings weredestroyed in half an hour or less. A
spokesman for Ukraine's civil defence organisation said
officials from both countries were keeping acareful watch to
keep the flames from spreading.

April 24 (Reuter) - A top Ukrainian official said on Wednesday
fires in the "exclusion zone" around the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant had been extinguished and had caused only minor, localised
increases inradiation. Volodymyr Kholosha, minister for
Chernobyl affairs, said brush fires in the 30-km (18-mile) zone
on Tuesday had probably been caused by residents on annual
visits to villages evacuated after the Chernobyl disaster
10years ago this week. "The reasons for the fire are being
investigated but the most likely explanation is carelessness by
these visitors. By evening all fires were brought under control
and extinguished," Kholosha said. "There was no danger to the
Chernobyl station as the fire did not approach it. There was no
overall change in radiation levels. Increases were noted in the
area immediately around the fires, but only within several
hundredmetres."

Radiation release at Chernobyl but environment safe

Kiev, April 25 (Reuter) - A small amount of radiation escaped at
the Chernobyl nuclear power station on theeve of the 10th
anniversary of the world's worst nuclear disaster, a spokesman
for the Ukrainian plant said onThursday. Oleg Goloskokov said
the radiation was cleaned up overnight and there was no threat
of contamination to theenvironment. The incident occurred on
Wednesday night when staff were changing filters used to pump
air from inside thesarcophagus encasing the fourth reactor,
which exploded on April 26, 1986. "The filters were changed in
normal fashion, but when the work was completed, the old filters
were left in aroom by the third reactor," he said by telephone
from Chernobyl. "This was radioactive material. As the work was
badly organised, radioactive dust contaminated four places.The
level of radioactivity rose seven times. There was no
irradiation of staff beyond norms. But this was aviolation of
safety rules and people could well have been affected." The
incident rated a minimum one on the international scale of seven
for reporting nuclear occurrences. Goloskokov said staff noted
the contamination in good time and cleaned it up completely
overnight,preventing a repetition of an incident last November
in which a staff member received a year's permitted dose
ofradiation. Ukraine, Belarus and Russia are staging elaborate
commemorations to mark the 10th anniversary of thedisaster,
which sent a plume of radioactivity over much of Europe. Ukraine
has pledged to shut down Chernobyl's two remaining working
reactors by the year 2000, butecologists say the plant is
dangerous and want it closed immediately. Anthony Froggatt, a
spokesman for the ecologist group Greenpeace, denounced the
incident as "a classicexample of the lack of safety culture that
exists at the Chernobyl station. It is not sufficient to close
the station inthe year 2000. it must be closed immediately."

Chernobyl scares Ukrainians less than poverty

By Elaine Monaghan Kiev, April 25 (Reuter) - Most Ukrainians
will never forget the day they heard Chernobyl's fourth reactor
hadexploded, but 10 years on some of the former Soviet
republic's citizens are far more worried about poverty thanany
threat from the station. Black banners depicting an atom and
reading "Chernobyl -- our sorrow" were draped along
KhreshchatykStreet, Kiev's broad main thoroughfare, in brilliant
sunshine on Thursday, the eve of the 10th anniversary. A
choirsang dirges nearby in Independence Square. Carelessness by
staff at the station 140 km (90 miles) to the north had caused a
radiation release -- thistime a minor one -- on Wednesday, but
noone seemed to know or care much. "Fears about Chernobyl are
not growing in Ukraine," said Alexander Stegni of the
Sotsis-Gallup polling centrein Kiev. "People are most worried
about the financial situation, personal security and health."
The centre's poll last week of 1,200 adults showed only 59
percent of Ukrainians were able to answer thequestion: "Which
event of significance to Ukraine happened in April 1986?" "It's
a psychological barrier, people don't want to know about the
danger of Chernobyl," said Sergei Ignatov,41, a translator
accompanying a group of Finnish businessmen. "Ten years of being
scared are more thanenough." "There are always accidents at
nuclear power plants. I'm sure Chernobyl is no worse than any
other," saidAlexander Zaitsev, 45, an out-of-work engineer.
Western countries have pledged $3 billion to help Ukraine meet
its commitment to close the station's twoworking reactors by the
year 2000. But Ukrainians are suspicious of this. People
interviewed on Thursday were equally sceptical about new pledges
to help Ukraine at a nuclearsummit in Moscow last week. Most
said they would believe it when they saw it. "I don't think
anyone in the world has enough money to close down Chernobyl and
put right all the damage ithas done," said Ignatov. Experts
disagree on the casualty toll. But officials here say the
world's worst nuclear accident was directlyresponsible for 4,300
deaths and affected a further 3.5 million people. "There are
always leaks, but we still have to live here, <a name=L10008></a><a href=#L10009>so</a> what's the
point in worrying," said Irina Kuznetsova,49. "It's better just
to keep smiling." But everyone remembered how they learned of
the accident, which sent a radioactive cloud across much
ofEurope. Lida Novak, a 33-year-old book-seller with a son of
11, came close to tears as she told how her family, likemost,
only found out a week later that the explosion was serious. "I
took my daughter out of school yesterday with a headache and a
bleeding nose. The doctor says it'sChernobyl. We're both
constantly tired," she said, describing symptoms which many
Ukrainians ascribe to thepower plant. "I'm not against atomic
energy as such. I'm just against them taking such an indifferent
attitude towardssafety," said Nikolai, 29, who helped evacuate
people living near the station two days after the accident. No
onehad warned him of the danger to his health. Vera Rostykhova
said: "If you thought about it too hard you would have to leave,
<a name=L10009></a><a href=#L10010>so</a> it's better not to think aboutit." It is easy to see why
Ukrainians might have other things to worry about in a country
where the average wageis the equivalent of $75 a month. Two
young men painting railings said their opinion did not matter.
"It's not up to us what happens toChernobyl. Of course it should
be closed, but no one cares what we think," one said.

Chernobyl cancers to peak in nine years

Reuters 20.03.96 - Former Soviet republics affected by the 1986
Chernobyl disaster face a peak in cancers caused by
radioactivity in about nine years' time, Belarus's Chernobyl
minister said Monday. Ivan Kenik said Belarus had little
experience with radiation-linked illness, notably thyroid cancer
in children, and needed Western help to cope. "The peak of the
consequences linked to the Chernobyl disaster will be reached in
about the year 2005 because of a sharp increase in cancers,"
Kenik said. "In contaminated regions, incidence of thyroid and
breast cancer and leukemia is two to three times higher than in
other regions." Belarus, sandwiched between Russia, Ukraine and
Poland, suffered the most from the explosion and fire at
Chernobyl, just over the border in Ukraine. Seventy percent of
the radiation spewed across most of Europe fell on its
territory. President Alexander Lukashenko said one quarter of
Belarus's territory had been contaminated by the disaster. Firm
statistics on the number of people affected by the disaster are
difficult to pin down, but authorities in Ukraine say it caused
several thousand deaths in their country alone. 

Study sees first genetic mutations after Chernobyl

By Maggie Fox London, April 24 (Reuter) - Scientists said on
Wednesday they had found the first evidence that children born
near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant had undergone genetic
mutations. Researchers said the studies were the first
affirmation that the explosion and fire at Chernobyl 10 years
agohad had any genetic effect on living things and would be sure
to spark off further research. "This is the first direct
evidence for radiation actually causing mutation in human
children" said Sir AlecJeffreys, a geneticist at Britain's
University of Leicester who worked on the study. But Jeffreys,
who pioneered the concept of genetic fingerprinting now used to
identify criminals, said thefindings did not mean the children
would develop diseases such as cancer. "This is all highly
preliminary and suggestive, although there does appear to be
something going on there,"he said, adding that most experts
never believed the low levels of radiation produced at Chernobyl
would havegenetic effects. "But it will in the future raise
questions about just what is the effect of low, persistent
levels of ionisingradiation in the environment from one human
generation to the next." Scientists agree the rate of thyroid
cancer, especially among children, rose in Belarus after the
April, 1986accident just across the border in Ukraine spewed a
radioactive cloud. In Belarus in particular, where 70 percent of
radiation leaked was deposited, more than 400 cases of
thyroidcancer among children have been recorded. The World
Health Organisation says this is 100 times pre-accidentlevels.
Jeffrey's group, who reported their findings in the science
journal Nature, collected blood samples from 79 Belarussian
families living in rural areas heavily affected by nuclear
fallout from the accident. The families all had children born
between February and September 1994 and both parents had stayed
inthe district continuously from the time of the accident. As a
comparison, they examined 105 British families whowere not
exposed. The Belarussian families had twice as many mutations as
the British families. The mutations were clearlyhanded down from
parent to child -- and were permanently coded in the children's
genes, meaning they willpass them on to any children they have.
Yuri Dubrova, a geneticist working at the Russian Academy of
Science and the University of Leicester, saidthe group looked at
certain genetic sites known as minisatellites which have a
mutation rate 1,000 times higherthan other genes. This makes the
mutations easier to spot. But he said they did not mean the
children would develop any diseases. "The sites have nothing to
do withany genetic system affecting variability, disease,
cancer, et cetera," Dubrova said. "They are absolutely neutral."
Experts agree it will be up to 50 years before all the health
effects of Chernobyl are seen. It takes that long formany
cancers caused by radiation to show up. Nonetheless, Jeffreys
said the findings were surprising. "The general assumption was
there would be no detectable effects. I think many people
thought 'we won'tbother looking at it because we won't see
anything'," he said. "The $64,000 question is that if (the genes
we tested) are sensitive to radiation, is that true for other
classesof human DNA? We simply don't know. We don't have the
right tests," he said. "To extend those studies to lookat
mutations that can result in inherited disease is beyond current
technology." A second study published on Wednesday found an
unusually high number of genetic mutations among volesliving
around the site of the plant. David Hillis of the University of
Texas at Austin said the findings were surprising. "The reports
will stimulate areassessment of the genetic and other biological
effects of exposure to nuclear waste," he wrote.

Ukraine tackles Chernobyl "sarcophagus" after delay

By Rostislav Khotin Kiev, April 25 (Reuter) - The cracked steel
and concrete "sarcophagus" covering the Chernobyl nuclearpower
station's ruined fourth reactor is back at centre stage in
debate on how to deal with the world's worstnuclear accident.
The ominous structure, housing 200 tonnes of mangled nuclear
materials and radioactive water left from thedisaster 10 years
ago on Friday, has again caught the attention of world leaders.
But only at Ukraine'sinsistence. "You cannot resolve the
<a name=L10010></a><a href=#L10011>so</a>-called Chernobyl problem without clarity on how to deal with
the sarcophagus andhow whatever you do will be paid for," Deputy
Foreign Minister Kostyantyn Hryshchenko said in an interview.
"We can agree to Western credits to close Chernobyl's two
working reactors and create alternative energysources. But we
insist on straightforward aid to fix the sarcophagus. This is
our biggest problem." Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy
countries, meeting last week in Moscow, noted Ukraine's
renewedcommitment to shut down Chernobyl's two working reactors.
But they also agreed for the first time to conduct a study by
the end of the year into replacing the "tomb." Ukrainian
diplomats said the meeting was held up because of tough
negotiations which ended with theissue being included in a final
statement. That reversed three years of inaction and confusion
by post-SovietUkraine's leaders. The original sarcophagus,
erected in the chaotic six months following the April
1986explosion and fire, was a tremendous feat of engineering.
After underestimating the extent of the disaster, Soviet leaders
mobilised hundreds of thousands of workers,used remote building
techniques and built a rail line to the devastated reactor.
"Liquidators" ran hundreds ofhelicopter-borne missions to dump
sand, concrete and boron on the site. But the structure,
separated from reactor No. 3 by a wall 10 metres (35 feet)
thick, was intended to last only30 years. Up to 2,000 sq. metres
(21,530 sq ft) of cracks developed, prompting alarm by Western
experts keen to shutdown the station quickly. Ukrainian
authorities patched most of them up, though they tried to dispel
alarm by saying the structureunderneath needed some openings to
prevent overheating. A tender was announced to replace the
sarcophagus with a new structure built to last at least a
century. But of 394 entries by mainly Western firms seeking
lucrative deals, not a single one was declaredsatisfactory and
matters remained at a standstill. A compromise group effort led
by French and British firms, dubbed "Alliance," failed to
resolve differenceswith the government. "We have to work out a
clear project -- maybe a second sarcophagus isn't necessary at
all," Ukraine'sChernobyl Affairs Minister Volodymyr Kholosha
told Reuters. "We have to work out a way to clear out
theradioactive mass inside, put it into containers and pump out
radioactive water." Ecologists decry the existing sarcophagus as
a disaster waiting to happen. Experts differ on how much of
athreat is posed by the high radiation levels inside and the
lava-like, tangled masses known as "elephant's feet." "A lot has
been done to stabilise and strengthen the sarcophagus. It's
stable and won't fall in as a whole,"said Kholosha. "But
individual sections could collapse, especially in case of an
earthquake, tornado or aircrash. "Part of the substances inside
are hard to reach or monitor. A chain reaction is hypothetically
possible butmore likely are small outbreaks or "flashes" of
radiation. An explosion of the sarcophagus is most unlikely."

26. 4. 96 - At official ceremonies, Lukashenko buried a "time
capsule" next to a church and a future monument to Chernobyl
victims. A letter signed by Lukashenko and the head of the
Belarussian Orthodox church wished future generations "a world
free of ecological evils and overflowing hospitals. Let us be
rid of contaminated land, water and air." In his television
address, Lukashenko said authorities had no moral right to stop
residents returning to their former homes in the 30-km (18-mile)
exclusion zone around Chernobyl. "We will return to our
villages. I am certain of this," Lukashenko said. "Through a
series of agricultural, chemical and technical processes, we
will be able to produce ecologically pure food on this land."

Chernobyl a burden on Ukraine's collapsed ...

By Yuri Kulikov KIEV, Ukraine, April 25 (Reuter) - Ukraine's
dilapidated health care system, in disarray even before the
collapse of the Soviet Union, is reeling under the burden
imposed by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster 10 years ago. The mass
release of radiation following the explosion and fire at the
plant has produced major, and costly, problems for the young
Ukrainian state. Senior officials angrily dismiss suggestions in
the West that Ukraine has overstated after-effects to win
international sympathy and money. "Anyone who says radiation has
no effect on the health of Ukrainians is sticking his head in
the sand. They are lying," said Environment Minister Yuri
Kostenko this month. "It has an influence, a powerful influence,
on people's health." Average Ukrainians are quick to attribute a
wide variety of health problems and aches and pains to
Chernobyl. But even a shortlist of problems facing the country's
doctors, often unpaid for months, is daunting. Most dramatic is
thyroid cancer in children and treatment and benefits for
350,000 front-line "liquidators" who have fallen ill or likely
to become sick after clean-up operations at the site 140 km (90
miles) north of Kiev. Another priority is the social upheaval
for hundreds of thousands of evacuees, further disoriented by
the elimination of the measure of security many felt they had in
the Soviet era. More long-term concerns focus on future genetic
mutations. Statistics vary widely on the dead and ailing.
Government officials have produced new figures, clearly with the
intention of using the anniversary of the April 26, 1986
disaster to draw attention to Ukraine's plight. In a
high-profile state of the union address this month President
Leonid Kuchma said 3.5 million Ukrainian citizens have suffered
ill-effects, one million of them children. Deputy Prime Minister
Vasyl Durdynets told parliament that 4,299 deaths since 1986
were directly attributable to Chernobyl. In 1987, 78 percent of
"liquidators" had been in good health, compared to only 20
percent now. For those affected in one way or another, life in
post-Soviet Ukraine offers little comfort. Ivan Tkachenko, 64,
was moved from his home inside Chernobyl's 30 km (18-mile)
exclusion zone to the village of Ludvinivka, 50 km (30 miles)
west of Kiev. A third of his 500 fellow evacuees have died since
their transfer, many of cancer. "My family and I and most of us
from our village can feel the influence of radiation from
Chernobyl," Tkachenko said. "The worst thing is they can't buy
expensive medicines, and haven't the strength to get themselves
to a hospital. Most people earn the equivalent of $20 to $40 a
month and many of us haven't been paid our pensions for months."
Many liquidators receive treatment at the Ukrainian Radiology
Medical Clinic just west of Kiev -- the only institution in
Ukraine studying the effects of radiation on humans. Geologist
Mykhailo Dmitriev, a healthy 30-year-old when he was summoned to
erect the steel and concrete "sarcophagus" now encasing
Chernobyl's ruined reactor No. 4, lost the use of both his legs
to paralysis a year ago. "I am just like a musician without
hands," said Dmitriev, now lying listlessly in a bed at the
clinic, his only distraction spinning the dial of his short wave
radio. A broken lamp stands on a small table next to his bed.
The clinic's chief doctor Volodymyr Bebeshko said 237 people had
radiation sickness in the initial months following the
explosion. Of those, 134 have died. Psychological damage has
pushed up suicide rates, alcoholism and other addictions,
Bebeshko said. In 1994 the United Nations opened community
centres offering counselling in contaminated areas in Ukraine,
Russia, and Belarus. "The psychological stress from the disaster
has caused more damage than the radiation itself," Bebeshko
said. "A study of Chernobyl employees working at the station
since 1986 showed 280, or 19 percent had committed suicide -all
from stress." Other workers had sunk into alcoholism or even
drinking aftershave lotion. Children in contaminated areas
displayed excessive nervousness and delayed development, he
said. Post-Soviet economic collapse meant there was no money at
his clinic to buy medicine or conduct proper research. "No one
could possibly say this catastrophe did anyone's health any
good," Bebeshko said. "Our doctors earn on average $60 to $100
per month but very often we just don't get paid at the end of
the month. That means we are losing many qualified specialists."
Deputy Health Minister Viktor Ponomarenko provides an even
longer list of post-Soviet ailments -- which may have as much or
more to do with post-Soviet decline than the accident. "We see
that the general level of health in Ukraine keeps getting worse
with all sorts of illnesses," he said. "There is cancer, blood
disorders, nervous system disorders and stomach problems. There
is a growing number of unhealthy children being born." Cash
problems and disputes over benefits have prompted "liquidators"
and others to stage periodic protests outside Ukraine's
parliament to remind authorities that they exist. But most, like
Dmitriev, are philosophical. "We, those who were at Chernobyl,
have certain benefits which other people do not enjoy. I get
free medicines," he said. "But to be frank, I would rather have
my health back."

Chernobyl staff mark 10 years since explosion

By Rostislav Khotin Chernobyl Power Station, Ukraine, April 26
(Reuter) - Workers from the Chernobyl power station stood in
silence on Friday to remember colleagues killed when the plant's
fourth reactor, now encased in concrete,exploded 10 years ago.
Hundreds of members of the 6,000-strong staff, facing the
plant's closure by the end of the century, heardone of Ukraine's
top nuclear industry officials say they had the power to
recapture public opinion -- by runningtheir station safely. "The
political environment is changing. Fortune is not smiling on you
now, but you have a powerful weapon which could turn that
around," said Mikhail Umanets, former director of both the
Chernobyl station and Ukraine'snuclear authority. "This weapon
is the safe operation of the Chernobyl station and I hope you
will use it faultlessly." A nearby meter showed the level of
radiation between 80 and 85 milliroentgens per hour -- far less
than the750 measured at the spot 10 years ago but still four
times higher than what are regarded as safe levels. The mourners
observed a minute's silence and many wept as an orchestra played
solemn music. A largebust of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin
stood nearby at the plant's entrance. The 10th anniversary
commemorations were marred by a minor release of radiation this
week which officialsblamed on lax working practices. But
Ukraine's nuclear industry, sent into a tailspin by the disaster
and then by the collapse of the SovietUnion, now enjoys great
prestige. Salaries, once far lower than in Russia, have been
improved and industry officials bask in the knowledge thattheir
15 reactors provide 40 percent of Ukraine's electricity. On
April 26, 1986, staff conducting an unauthorised experiment lost
control of the reactor and it exploded,blowing the unit's roof
into the air and sending a cloud of radioactivity over most of
Europe. Ukraine says 4,300 people died as a direct result of the
accident and many of its 350,000 clean-up workersare now ill.
Millions were affected -- mostly in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia.
Officials say Chernobyl's two working reactors are safe, but
President Leonid Kuchma has promised underWestern pressure to
close them down. In exchange, Ukraine has received pledges of $3
billion in Western aidfor decommissioning and more to replace
the cracking "sarcophagus" around the ruined reactor. "Chernobyl
was definitely a technical fault. Very serious mistakes were
made in the safety system but nowthere is no reason for
concern," one of the station's top safety experts, Vladimir
Chugunov, told Reuters. The mother and son of the first person
to die in the disaster wept as they placed flowers in his memory
at thefoot of a bronze statue depicting a man fighting a blaze.
Oleg Khodymchuk, 19, and his grandmother Anna donned white
smocks for protection, looking just like thehundreds of
thousands of "liquidators" who risked and lost their lives
trying to deal with the disaster's aftermath. "I learned of my
father's death on the second day, when a teacher told me at
school that my father's bodycould not be found," Oleg told
Reuters on Friday. The body of Valery Khodymchuk, a 34-year-old
operator who was working on the night shift of April 26,
hasnever been recovered and is thought to lie buried in the
reactor. Many people in Ukraine, which won independence from
Moscow in 1991, blame the accident on Sovietauthorities, accused
of sacrificing safety for cheap energy. Staff member Tatyana
Borets, who was also working at Chernobyl on April 26 1986, saw
no reason to fear anew accident at the plant and, like many,
firmly opposed its closure. "There would be nothing to gain from
closing it down," she said. "The radiation already in the soil
would notsuddenly go away. Chernobyl is not a symbol of horror,
but a symbol of political gain."

UKRAINIAN AUTHORITIES JAIL ANTI-NUCLEAR PROTESTERS

By Renfrey Clarke, Moscow - With close to a thousand square
kilometres of Ukraine made uninhabitable by the 1986 Chernobyl
nuclear disaster, you might expect the authorities in the
capital, Kiev, to take a tolerant attitude to protests against
nuclear power. And you might think the government would permit
state-owned mass media organs to give a hearing to anti-nuclear
campaigners. Not a bit of it. In the week leading up to the
tenth anniversary of the Chernobyl catastrophe on April 26, the
Ukrainian government banned its media outlets from publicising
anti-nuclear information. As for public actions in Kiev to mark
the anniversary - these were forbidden by the city's mayor. When
anti-nuclear campaigners on April 23 defied the ban on
demonstrations and picketed government offices, the result was
bruised limbs and a string of arrests and jailings. The
anti-nuclear protest action began early in the afternoon of
April 23 when environmentalists from Ukraine, Russia and other
countries gathered on Independence Square in Kiev. The
protesters were demanding the shutting down of the remaining
reactors at the Chernobyl plant; an end to moves for the further
development of nuclear power in Ukraine; the initiation of a
program to close down all the country's nuclear power plants;
and the development of non-nuclear energy alternatives. The
activists first created a chain symbolising Ukrainian nuclear
dependence. Then followed speakers who included Sergey Fomichev,
a well-known activist of the Rainbow Keepers radical
environmental group, and Vladimir Slivyak, an anti-nuclear
spokesperson for the Russian-based Social-Ecological Union.
After about an hour some 30 demonstrators marched to the offices
of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, and mounted a picket
outside the building. About thirty minutes later special forces
police moved in to smash the gathering, arresting a total of 19
demonstrators. The "justice" these people received was as rough
as their arrests had been. The environmentalists were denied
lawyers and translators as well as medical treatment. At the
Pechersky Police Office that evening, they were put before a
magistrate who denied them any chance to speak. Five of the
demonstrators, including Fomichev and Slivyak, were jailed. The
imprisoned activists began a hunger strike. Anti-nuclear
activists discussed the arrests with representatives of the Kiev
Committee for the Protection of Human Rights. The committee
members noted that at least five serious violations of Ukrainian
laws appeared to have occurred during the arrests and the trial.
By April 26 Fomichev and Slivyak had been released. On the
street near the Kiev mayor's office, the two addressed an
impromptu press conference. "The authorities tried to threaten
us and disrupt our plans for the Chernobyl anniversary," Slivyak
declared. "But they can't kill the worldwide anti-nuclear
movement, just as they can't kill the memory of Chernobyl."
Special forces police soon arrived to drive off demonstrators
who had unfurled a banner near where the press conference was
taking place. The arrested picketers were released only
gradually, and at least one was still being held on April 29.
The Anti-Nuclear Campaign in the Former USSR is now consulting
with lawyers, with a view to launching a criminal court case
around the violation of the environmentalists' human rights.
Despite the continuing horror of Chernobyl, the nuclear industry
remains an influential force in Ukraine. Europe's largest
nuclear power plant, the third largest in the world, is at
Zaporizhye in the country's south-east. At present, nuclear
power accounts for about 35 per cent of Ukraine's electricity
production; anxious to reduce dependency on gas supplies from
neighbouring Russia, the Ukrainian government plans to increase
this figure to as much as 60 per cent. Billions of dollars are
at stake in orders for new nuclear power installations in
Ukraine, and the people who run the former Soviet nuclear
industry have no intention of allowing environmentalists to
block the spending of this money. In setting out to protect
their profits, the nuclear bosses obviously have the ear of the
Ukrainian state authorities.

Belarus leader says Chernobyl evacuees can return

By Yuri Svirko Minsk, April 25 (Reuter) - Belarussian President
Alexander Lukashenko said on Thursday that peopleevacuated 10
years ago from areas contaminated by the Chernobyl nuclear
disaster would one day be able toreturn and produce
radiation-free food. Lukashenko, in a television address marking
the anniversary of the April 26, 1986 explosion, said
authoritieshad no moral right to stop residents from returning
to their former homes in areas near the station just over
theborder in Ukraine. "Today many people are returning to their
villages from where they were taken in a hastily
organisedevacuation. Authorities have no right to stop these
people. This is not the Christian, the human way," Lukashenko
said. "We will return to our villages. I am certain of this.
Through a series of agricultural, chemical and
technicalprocesses, we will be able to produce ecologically pure
food on this land." Belarus, downwind from the disaster, was
worst affected by radioactivity which spewed out of
Chernobyl'sruined fourth reactor, receiving 70 percent of the
total fallout. Lukashenko, an advocate of some form of union
with neighbouring Russia, has described the disaster as
a"radioactive tornado never seen before." Hundreds, perhaps
thousands, have returned to derelict homes in the 30-km
(18-mile) exclusion zonearound the plant. Authorities in Ukraine
and Belarus decline to enforce the ban. But experts have said
the territory should not be used, particularly for growing food,
for an extended period oftime. Lukashenko says his country of 10
million still devotes 25 percent of its budget to cleanup
operations. A quarter of the former Soviet republic's territory
remains contaminated and Lukashenko toured the worst affected
areas by helicopter last week. The president is to mark the
anniversary on Friday at a solemn ceremony and church service in
Minsk. (...)

Gorbachev recalls struggle to cope with Chernobyl

By Timothy Heritage, Moscow, April 26 (Reuter) - A solemn
Mikhail Gorbachev on Friday defended his handling of the nuclear
accident at Chernobyl exactly 10 years ago, but said the Soviet
leadership had been completely unprepared forsuch a disaster. "I
think we simply were not ready. Absolutely not," Gorbachev, who
was Soviet leader at the time of theaccident on April 26, 1986,
told a news conference. "If anything was not done, it was simply
because we did not know (what to do)." Remembering the long
nights he spent trying to deal with the world's worst nuclear
accident, he said:"Someone said that Gorbachev went grey in
those weeks. Yes, I did." Gorbachev, now 65, recalled presiding
over an emergency session of the Communist Party Politburo
assoon as word reached Moscow of the fire and explosion at the
Chernobyl power plant in Ukraine, which wasthen part of the
Soviet Union. Party leaders then met day and night, summoned top
scientists, consulted them constantly and set up aspecial
commission to investigate. But Gorbachev's account of the events
painted a picture of a whole country groping in the dark. It
took Moscow almost three days to admit the accident had
occurred, even though a cloud of radiation spreadacross Europe.
Western leaders criticised the Soviet authorities for failing to
tip off its own public and othercountries soon enough. The
West's reaction had suprised him, Gorbachev said, because the
Soviet leadership had not realised thefull implications of the
disaster. "Today they say we hid some things, kept them secret.
That is rubbish. We were short of information," hesaid. "I won't
say it was lack of responsiblity or fear. We acted seriously.
But we lacked information -- there were alot of things we did
not know...In this situation, something was neglected in the
early stages." Gorbachev resigned as Soviet president as the
Soviet Union broke up. He is trying to stage a politicalcomeback
by running for president in the June 16 election, though opinion
polls say he has no chance ofsuccess. Gorbachev made clear the
problems of dealing with a nuclear accident on a scale never
seen before hadcontinued long after the disaster. "Every week
and every month there were new surprises," he said. Hundreds of
thousands of "liquidators" were eventually sent to take part in
clean-up operations at Chernobyl. Ukrainian officials say there
is a direct link between the Chernobyl disaster and about 4,300
deaths. It alsoaffected the lives and health of a further 3.5
million people, they say. Gorbachev praised those who fought the
fire. "I want to recall the immense pain and suffering of those
whosuffered the first blows not knowing what, in fact, had
happened," he said. He said he now divided his life into the
periods before and after Chernobyl. The tragedy had affected the
livesof everyone, he said. Some experts say the Chernobyl
disaster, in the long term, played a major role in developing
his policy of"glasnost," or openness. Gorbachev said it had
helped the cause of nuclear disarmament, paving the way to arms
control treaties with the United States, although the process
still had some way to go.

"ENVIRONMENT AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN CENTRAL EUROPE: PROBLEMS OF
TRANSITION - Conference Proceedings" on CD-ROM available NOW

Understanding the changes in Central and Eastern Europe - their
past and present trends, causes, and prospects - was the main
objective of the International Geographical Union 1994 Regional
Conference. Over 1000 scientists and other professionals from
universities, government and environmental organizations, and
business around the world were involved in discussing key
problems covering major areas: education, research, technology
and the policies. This selection offers over 480 thematically
organized papers written by internationally acclaimed
contributors representing more than 50 countries. Providing an
up-to-date and critical review of diverse problems, it will
fulfill scholarly interests of university teachers, students and
researchers as well as practical needs of government officials,
administrators and the general public who are concerned with any
aspects of environment and quality of life.

Die Region Tjumen liegt oestlich des Urals und ist mehr als
dreimal <a name=L10011></a><a href=#L10012>so</a> gross ist wie Frankreich. Es gliedert sich in die
drei Bezirke des eigentlichen Tjumen, der Chanty und Mansi und
der Jamal- Nenzen. Es besteht aus ausgedehnten Sumpfgebieten,
die im Sueden von Nadelwald durchbrochen werden. Der
Jamal-Nenzische Bezirk wird von baumloser Tundra beherrscht. Die
indigene Bevoelkerung besteht aus Chanty, Mansi und Wald-Nenzen
im Sueden, aus Nenzen, Komi und Selkupen im Norden. Durch den
Zuzug anderer Bevoelkerungsgruppen infolge der Stalinschen
Umsiedlungspolitik und der Oelfoerderung stellen die indigenen
BewohnerInnen nur noch 1,5% im Chanty-Mansisker Bezirk bzw. 10%
im Jamal-Nenzischen Bezirk dar. Da die Zugezogenen fast alle in
den Staedten leben, bilden auf dem Land die Indigenen dennoch
die Mehrheit. Der Schwerpunkt der Oelfoerderung ist der Bezirk
der Chanty und Mansi, den Schwerpunkt der Gasfoerderung bildet
der Jamal-Nenzische Bezirk.

AID FOR NUCLEAR SAFETY DECLINING
Moscow, -  Western  aid  for nuclear plant safety in Russia is
down 20 per cent this year despite problems at  the  country's
old nuclear facilities,  a news report said Wednesday.
Gennady Nefyodov, deputy chief of the Atomic Energy Ministry's
foreign relations department,  said the decline in funds would
affect  research  as  well  as  projects  already  under  way.
Russia has  received  some  $500  million  for  upgrading  and
repairing its nuclear plants in the past  five  years  (Russia
have spent  at  least  $500  million  own money for same goals
during last 5 years,  - EDI) , Nefyodov told the Interfax news
agency. The  amount  slated for 1996 is 20 per cent lower than
last year.
     
BELARUS COMPILANCE
Minsk, - Belarus on Tuesday denied Russian allegations that it
is undertermining  agreements  on  the  withdrawal  of  former
Soviet nuclear missiles to Russia.
Belarusian Deefense  Minister  Leonid Maltsev said Belarus was
determined to adhere to a shedule approved  by  both  nations,
and to  coplete the pullout of the 18 remaining strategic,  or
long-range, missiles by the end of the  year.  Maltsev  called
"factless" Monday's   accusations  by  the  russian  strategic
missile forces' command  that  Belarus  had  filed  to  ensure
timely removal of the weapons.
"Half a year lies ahead  yet,  and  <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a>  a  disruption  of  the
shedule ...  is  out  of the question," he said,  according to
Interfax.
     
DYSENTERY OUTBREAK
Noscow, - Sewage seeping into tap water in the central Russian
city of Vladimir has caused an outbreak of dysentery that sent
more than 60 people to the hospital.
Few of the victims had drunk  the  water  without  boiling  it
first, but  had  used  it  to  wash fruit and vegetables or to
brush their teeth,  Itar-Tass reported Monday, citing a doctor
with the  city  sanitation department.  All those hospitalized
live in the same neighborhood of Vladimir, about 160 kilometrs
east of Moscow.
Breaks in sewage pipes near a new shoe factory  caused  sewage
to seep into water mains, the report said.

      CHERNOBYL: NO PROBLEMS SINCE 1986, OFFICIALS TOLD

by David Stickney

Introduction

Here is the official press release from the Chernobyl  Nuclear
Power Plant Regarding the 10 year anniversary of the Chernobyl
Disaster.  It was given to me by the  Public  Relations  staff
during  my  visit  to  the  station.  This document speaks for
itself regarding the station's attitude towards  its  history.
Below, also my "NOTE"


IN CONNECTION WITH THE 10-TH YEAR  ANNINVERSARY  OF  CHERNOBYL
ACCIDENT For 10 years since the accident, Chernobyl NNP's life
has been complicated and controversial. After the heroic phase
liquidating the aftermath,  of constructing the sacophagus, of
restoration and restart of the undamaged units,  of making the
new  town,  there followed the phase of personnel replacement.
Eight times the decision was taken and revoked to shutdown the
station.   They  compelled  the  staff  to  leave  their  Kiev
apartments and to move to Slavutich,  which was built,  as  it
was found out, on a caesium patch.

To profile  themselves,  many  of  today's  famous  public and
political figures,  mass media were particularly  stigmatizing
Chernobyl  NPP and were demonstrating negative attitude to the
nuclear   industry   in   general,   calling   for   immediate
renunciation of nuclear power.

Nevertheless the station kept on working.  The collective body
of staff was formed,  safety and  reliability  were  improved.
Slavutich   was  developed  and  equipped  with  services  and
utilities.

Since the accident,  Chernobyl NPP has generated more than 127
billion kWh of electricity of over US 5.5 billion total worth.

To enhance  safety,  chenges  were  made  to  the RBMK reactor
design and to  physical  characterristics  of  all  opperating
units,  which rules out the possibility of the particular type
of accident  to  recur.  More  than  $300  million  have  been
invested in Chernobyl NPP's safety.  Safe opperation is in the
hands of skilled personnel.  In 1995 Chernobyl NPP produced 10
percent  more  electricity than in 1994,  and it had the least
number of malfunctions - two per one unit - the  best  showing
in Ukraine and the CIS.

Last year  17.5  thousand square meters of dwelling space were
commisioned in Slavutich as  well  as  the  main  building  of
health care day center.  Actually,  Slavutich is a modern town
of  25,000  inhabitants.  It  has   developed   infrastruture:
telephone communication and cable television are availible for
every family.

The station's staff is committed to their duty  ensuring  safe
operation  of  the  and  producing  electricity.  The  workers
strongly believe in good sense of leadership  of  the  country
and are confident of the future.

***

IMPORTANT NOTE:  The PR rep at the station stated that he felt
that people  should  not have been evacuated from local towns,
and they should return,  as this is a greater  injustice  than
the accident itself.

They constantly  repeated  that  the  area  was a safe working
place.  Our readings outside the  reactor  from  our  personal
equipment showed more than 660 Roentgen (Gomel 10).

Slavutich is the newest town in Ukraine, food is imported, and
the standard of living is of a western standard.

The staff continually related station  situations  with  there
high standard of living as a sign of progress at the station.

In fact,  the  "spokesman"  in  a private conversation with me
stated " I don't care if the EU gave 3.1 billion to shut  down
the plant, if it reduced my standard of living, I would take a
machine gun to the  council  and  say  'up  against  the  wall
guys'.......  Well  I'm Just kidding".  The was heard by Julie
Denesha of the KS Star I don't believe he was kidding,  as  he
only said this after seeing our reaction.

When I  asked about the future plans for disposal of the waste
of reactor 4,  I was told " This isn't our work,  we  are  not
responsible".

When I asked about the status of the sarcophagus,  they stated
it was completely safe

In the document,  or any  publications,  the  results  on  the
population are not mentioned

                 BELARUS: WHAT REPRESSION?

Clintonites ignore  Soviet-style  stifling   of   dissent   in
Belarus'.

Yury Khadyka,  a veteran freedom fighter in Belarus', has been
imprisoned   since  April  27  for  protesting  his  country's
re-integration with Russia.  The U.S. government's reactionhas
been  embarrassed  silence-  certainly  no  protest- about the
conduct of the Belarusian regime it is subsidizing.

Khadyka, 58,  a distinguished art historian,  was an  activist
against Communist tyranny when Belarus (White Russia) was part
of the Soviet Union. A vice chairman of the Belarusian Popular
Front,  he  as continued the fight against President Aleksandr
Lukashenko's increasingly repressive rule over Belarus' as  an
independent  country.  Khadyka now faces a possible three-year
prison  term  for  "organizing  action  resulting   in   great
disturbance of peace."

The purpose  of singling out Khadyka,  former U.S.  Ambassador
David H.  Swartz told me, is to "discourage further repression
of opposition" to Lukashenko's policy of rejoining Russia in a
reconstitution of the Soviet Union. "The present government is
not  willing  to  tolerate dissent",  added Swartz,  a 28-year
veteran of the U.S.  foreign service who resigned in  1994  in
protest against Clinton administration's coddling of the Minsk
regime.

Leaked documents and  diplomatic  sources  make  itclear  that
President  Clinton  and  Secretary  of State Warren Cristopher
have given a green light to Russian President  Boris  Yeltsin,
running   for  re-election,  to  proceed  with  re-integrating
constituent parts of  the  former  Soviet  Union.  Given  this
attitude,  would  the  Clinton  administration  intervene when
Belarus represses dissent? The answer is that it does not. The
dilemma  at  the  State  Department  is  intense.  One  senior
official there told me that "we support freedom  of  assembly,
support  freedom  of  speech  and  condemn violations of those
freedoms" in a former Soviet  republic  which  has  become  an
American  client  state.  But  he  indicated  no  knowledge of
Khadyka's  imprisonment.  That  may  have  been  a  diplomatic
circumvention,  considering  assertions by American Belarusian
groups who say they have brought Khadyka's predicament to this
very official's attention.

Khadyka is  a victim of flotsam from the old Communist tyranny
that has risen in the  surface  in  Soviet  successor  states.
President   Lukashenko,  a  career  Communist  bureaucrat  who
managed a collective farm,  yearns for return of dictatorship.
He  has expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler's leadership and
prefers to rule  by  edict,  ignoring  wherever  possible  the
parliament  whose  very election he opposed.  Lukashenko wants
ful integration with a  Kremlin  ruled  by  one  of  Yeltsin's
authoritarian  presidential  rivals  but  will  settle  for  a
Yeltsin- run Russia- at east for now.  The erratic  Belarusian
president  consequently  was  not  happy  when  20,000  people
demonstrated in downtown Minsk April 2 against the pact signed
that  day  by  Lukashenko  and Yeltsin for renowed integration
between Russia and Belarus.  When the same  opposition  forces
organized  another  demonstration  of  some 30,000 April 26 in
Minsk to mark the 10th anniversay  of  the  Chernobyl  nuclear
disaster,  Lukashenko cracked down. The marshers, assured safe
passage by the police,  colided with the  cordon  of  "special
forces".  Dozens  of peaceful demonstrators were beaten in the
streets,  and more than 200 were arrested. Most were convicted
in "administrative trials" and then confined for from three to
10 days in jail.

Yury Khadyka was given different treatment.  He  was  arrested
April  27  and  then  held  incommunicado  for  a week- denied
contact with lawers or family.  He finally was charged on  May
4. Despite a petition from seven prominent citizens (including
four members of parliament) guaranteeing that he  will  appear
for trial,  Khadyka remains in prison while an "investigation"
goes on for at least two and possibly  six  months.  Khadyka's
29-year-old son, Alexey, is a field representative in Belarus'
for the  Washington-  based  Krieble  Institute,  which  began
promoting  democracy  in Eastern Europe long before the Soviet
Union's collapse."Do you think it is possible  that  the  U.S.
Embassy  will  make a note [ of protest]?" the son asked May 2
in an e-mail to Krieble headquarters.

The answer <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a> far is no. If Clinton could meet with Yeltsin in
their  latest  summit and not protest the carnage in Chechnya,
it  is  not  difficult  for  him  to  overlook  repression  in
Belarus'.  The  American president's determination is to elect
Yeltsin to another term and worry about  unhappy  developments
in the former Soviet Union after that.

7 June  1996 Chemical Weapons Working Group distribute request to sup-
port for senator ford's amendment to senate bill 1745.

DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION AMENDMENT PENDING TO STOP INCINERATION :

Senator Wendell Ford (D-Ky) is poised to submit an  amendment  to  the
1997 Defense Authorization Bill, S.1745, that would do the following:

1) Place  a three year moratorium on contracts by the Army for incine-
rators for CW disposal.

2) Shift $50 Million from  the  incineration  program  to  ALTERNATIVE
TECHNOLOGIES  program  to  demonstrate  non-incineration approaches to
include ALL sites, including CW munitions sites.

3) Change the existing "stockpile elimination  deadline"  of  December
31,  2004 and substitute the U.S.  obligations under the Chemical Wea-
pons Convention, yet to be ratified.

We are seeking your help in getting Co-sponsors for this Amendment. It
has  been  a  12 year battle to stop this program:  NOW IS THE TIME TO
ACT!!

Targets: All U.S.  Senators,  with particular emphasis on  those  from
Oregon,  Arkansas,  Alabama, Indiana, Utah, Colorado, Maryland, Hawaii
and Kentucky (McConnell).

Other primary targets are members of the Senate Armed Services and Se-
nate Defense Appropriations Committees.

SOME INFORMATION ABOUT AMARC? 
 
AMARC, the World Association of Community Radio  
Broadcasters, is a world-wide network of community  
radio stations founded in 1983. It is a  non- 
governmental organisation dedicated to the promotion  
and development of community radio world-wide. Its  
members are radio stations, production groups and  
associations of radio stations which operate for social  
purposes and are independent of governments and large  
media organisations. 
 
After several years of increased activity in Europe the  
European members of AMARC launched a European section.  
At the first Pan-European conference which took place  
in Slovenia in September 1994, AMARC-Europe was founded  
as a European Non-Governmental Organisation. Its  
secretariat, currently hosted by the Community Radio  
Association in the UK, coordinates transnational  
projects and programmes carried out by and for its  
members in Eastern, Central and Western Europe.

IGNALINA POWER PLANT,  LITHUANIA --  A  NUCLEAR  FUEL  STORAGE
FACILITY  IS  PLANNED  at the Ignalina power plant and will be
financed by Ontario Hydro Company together with  tenders  from
Canadian AECL and German GNB companies.  Spent nuclear fuel in
Ignalina is stored today  in  underwater  reservoirs  situated
under  the  plant reactors.  The reservoirs will soon be full.
The Ontario Hydro director for Eastern  Europe,  John  Kieran,
said  his  company  already  worked with Ignalina power plant,
including the implementation of a program related  to  quality
management at the station.

ST PETERSBURG  --  ALEXANDER  NIKITIN  WILL  BE  JUDGED  BY  A
MILITARY  COURT  and  not by a civilian court,  according to a
recent decision by a city court.  Mr Nikitin has been  accused
of  revealing  state  military  secrets  in  his  work  on  an
environmental report  on  the  damage caused by (nuclear waste
of) the Northern Fleet.  His lawyer  has  issued  an  official
protest against  the  decision  for  him  to  be  judged  by a
non-civilian court.  Mr Nikitin was working for the  Norwegian
independent environmental  association  Bellona  when  he  was
arrested at the beginning of the year.

LUKASHENKO CALLS FOR NUCLEAR-FREE ZONE, MINSK, - The president
of Belarus on  Wednesday  said  the  nations  of  central  and
eastern Europe should be kept free of nuclear weapons.
Belarus inherited part of Moscow's nuclear arsenal after  1991
Soviet collapse,  along mwith Russia,  Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
Belarus promised to disarm by the end of 1996.
"I propose  that  the  former  socialist  countries of eastern
Europe, Belarus,  Ukraine and the Baltic countries should  set
up a nuclear free zone," President Alexander Lukashenko said.
But he  added  that  "a   unilateral   step   toward   nuclear
disarmament is  not enough" and expressed concern about NATO's
eastward expansion.

BALTIC SEA STATES ADOPT COOPERATION PROGRAMME,  KALMAR,  - The
foreign ministers  of  the  Baltic  Sea  states  on  Wednesday
adopted an action programme to boost regional  cooperation  in
crime-fighting, the   economy,  the  environment  and  nuclear
safety.
The 11 foreign ministers,  representing nine states around the
Baltic Sea plus Norway and Iceland,  hammered out the  details
of the  17-page  document  on  Tuesday  evening  and Wednesday
morning.
Several investments in the region are planned,  including road
and railway maintenance and harbour developments, totalling 40
billion kronor ($6,01 billion) for the 1995-1999 repiod.
Estonia, Latvia,  Lithuania,  Poland and Russia  will  receive
assistance in  cleaning up the environment,  particularly with
regard to treating toxic waste.

IGNALINA POWER PLANT,  LITHUANIA --  A  NUCLEAR  FUEL  STORAGE
FACILITY  IS  PLANNED  at the Ignalina power plant and will be
financed by Ontario Hydro Company together with  tenders  from
Canadian AECL and German GNB companies.  Spent nuclear fuel in
Ignalina is stored today  in  underwater  reservoirs  situated
under  the  plant reactors.  The reservoirs will soon be full.
The Ontario Hydro director for Eastern  Europe,  John  Kieran,
said  his  company  already  worked with Ignalina power plant,
including the implementation of a program related  to  quality
management at the station. (ELTA)

ST PETERSBURG  --  ALEXANDER  NIKITIN  WILL  BE  JUDGED  BY  A
MILITARY  COURT  and  not by a civilian court,  according to a
recent decision by a city court.  Mr Nikitin has been  accused
of  revealing  state  military  secrets  in  his  work  on  an
environmental report on the  damage  caused  by  the  Northern
Fleet.  His  lawyer has issued an official protest against the
decision for him to be judged  by  a  non-civilian  court.  Mr
Nikitin    was   working   for   the   Norwegian   independent
environmental association Bellona when he was arrested at  the
beginning of the year.

Vilnius/Lithuania (MT) - A $ 6.7 million loan from the  Nordic
Investment Bank  in in the works for Lithuania to help finance
construction of the Via Baltica trans-European highway.
Lithuanian deputy communication minister Algirdas Sakalys told
Interfax that final results were expected from loan  talks  by
Tuesday. Lithuania  is planning to bildt 100-km of the highway
by the year 2000 for $60 million.

RIGA-TALLINN-VILNIUS -- BALTIC  STATE  LEADERS  HAVE  SEVERELY
CRITICIZED  a proposed agreement between Russia and the United
States for Russians to station 600  armored  vehicles  in  the
Pskov  region  at Russia's border with Estonia and Latvia,  in
place of the 180 vehicles there  at  present.  The  desire  of
Russia to increase its forces in this area is considered to be
a counter measure to NATO expansion.  Russia,  as a result  of
the  proposed  agreement,  would be allowed to station arms at
its boundaries with the Baltic and Nordic states  in  5  times
higher  numbers  than  the conventional arms agreements allow.
(ELTA)

VILNIUS --  THE  LITHUANIAN  PARLIAMENT HAS RATIFIED THE BERNE
CONVENTION,  the European Agreement on Wild Nature and Natural
Environment Protection. Lithuanian Minister of the Environment
Bronius Bradauskas said ratification of this  document  was  a
significant   step  for  Lithuania  in  its  integration  into
European Union environmental structures.  The Berne Convention
came  into  force  on July 1,  1982.  It has been signed by 31
European  states  and  European  Union  and  is  an  important
international  agreement for the preservation of nature,  wild
vegetation, and rare animals. (ELTA)

VILNIUS --  THE  ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT TO LITHUANIAN FORESTS is
serious today,  but not catastrophic,  said Forestry  Minister
Albertas Vasiliauskas at a news conference.  Up to 3,000-3,200
cubic meters of wood have been felled annually in  Lithuania's
forests since 1961,  whereas the maximum possible output could
reach  5,000  cubic  meters  without  a  harm  to  the  forest
resources,  he  said.  A 1.5-fold increase in wood production,
followed by its export,  is expected over the  course  of  the
next five years.  He described new plans to build a new modern
pulp mill in Lithuania to produce about 300 thousand  tons  of
pulp per year,  which would satisfy Lithuania's own demand and
allow exports of about 100 thousand tons. (ELTA)

TALLINN -- A RADIATION VAN HAS BEEN GIVEN TO ESTONIAN  CUSTOMS
by the U.S. Customs Board. The van is equipped with technology
capable of detecting radiation and X-rays.  Its purpose is  to
hinder   and   detect  smuggling  of  radioactive  substances,
including  nuclear  weapons.  The  van  is  also  capable   of
detecting explosives, plastic explosives and drugs. A conveyer
strip inside the van allows it to look through 1,500 pieces of
baggage an hour. The vans have been constructed for the use by
the U.S. Customs Board at a cost of 250,000 U.S. dollars each.
The  new  van will be located in the southern Estonian town of
Voru and will be mainly used on the Russian border. (ETA)

MAY INCREASE POLLUTION
by Christian Rekkedal
Oslo/Norway

"On background on warnings from Bellona,  "Hoire" (right  wing
party),  "SV" (Socialist party), "Senterpartiet" (agrar party)
and  "Kristelig  Folkeparti"  (christian  democrats)  are  now
asking a lot of questions about the case from Foreign Minister
Bjoern Toe Godal.
"Kvaerner Moss Technology have made the pre-study to a project
dealing with dismantling of decommissioned nuclear submarines.
Norway shall use  150  million  NOK.  The  negotiations  on  a
Norwegian-Russian agreement shall be finished within June 30.
"The plan presumes,  among other things, that the storages for
spent fuel at the Andrejeva bay shall be emptied. The fuel are
to be sent to the reprocessing facilities at Mayak.
(about Mayak..."Norway  shall  eventually  also  contribute to
building a temporarly storage plant in Majak.)
"Bellona asks the Foreign department to forget the plans.  The
foundation  states  that  the venture will not contribute to a
betterment of the environmental situation in  Russia.  On  the
contrary  they  point to the huge problems in association with
the waste and emmissions from the reprocessing plant at Mayak.
"If the authorities goes forth with this problem, it will mean
increased  emissions  and  direct  health consequences for the
populace in the area,  states Thomas Nilsen at Bellona. He has
recieved  communications from environmental groups in the town
of Chelyabinsk near Mayak  who  ask  for  cancelation  of  the
plans.
"Bellona also  points  out  that  Mayak  is  a closed military
facility."
"Norway should at least demand that the facilities are  opened
for  inspection  by  the  civilian Russian authorities and the
international atomic energy agency (IAEA) states Nilsen.
"Representative for the four political parties are now sending
a  letter  to the Foreign minister with eleven questions about
this case.

                      BALLERINA WORKSHOP

STOCKHOLM -- The first BALLERINA (BALtic  Sea  Region  On-line
Environmental   Information  Resources  for  INternet  Access)
workshop brought together about 65 representatives of  a  wide
variety    of   government,   academic,   and   non-government
organizations  from  the  Baltic   Sea   region   to   Swedish
Environmental  Protection Agency headquarters on June 13-14 to
discuss the development  of  an  Internet-based  environmental
network in the region.  Participants at the workshop expressed
unanimous support for the BALLERINA initiative.
The aim of  the  workshop  was  to  discuss  and  provide
guidelines on how to make the BALLERINA initiative the gateway
for environmental information on the Baltic Sea region on  the
Internet  through  the use of a series of World Wide Web pages
with a coordinating function of the many existing  information
sources  now available about the environment in the Baltic Sea
region.
BALLERINA is being  developed  as  a  cooperative  effort
among agencies and organizations which produce and disseminate
environmental  information  about  the  Baltic  Sea  and   its
drainage area. To an increasing extent, much information about
the environmental state of the region is already available  by
Internet.  Yet  that same information is not easily visible or
searchable from a single World Wide Web homepage location.
During the course of the two-day workshop, working groups
discussed  a  series  of  aspects  of  the project,  including
institutional, informational, and financial dimensions. A wide
variety of ideas and concrete proposals were presented by each
of the working groups to the entire workshop.  Representatives
from Denmark,  Estonia,  Finland,  Germany,  Hungary,  Latvia,
Lithuania,  Norway, Poland, Russia, and Sweden participated in
the working groups of the workshop.
Several workshop participants presented existing examples
of environmental work of their organizations on the  Internet.
Those  organizations  included  the  CIESIN  Estonian  Center,
UNEP/GRID-Arendal,   TallinNet,   the   Finnish    Environment
Institute, and the Regional Environmental Center (Budapest).
A representative  from the Great Lakes Commission,  Carol
Cratza,  presented  the  experience   of   the   Great   Lakes
Information  Network (GLIN).  The BALLERINA initiative will be
able to draw on the example of GLIN as a successful electronic
network  concerning  the environmental issues of international
waterbodies.
An ad hoc committee was designated and  approved  by  the
workshop  for  further  organization  and  realization  of the
BALLERINA initiative.  A first general assembly  of  BALLERINA
participants  is  now  planned  for early 1997.  The BALLERINA
workshop was sponsored by the Swedish Environmental Protection
Agency and UNEP/GRID.

    RUSSIA:  WORLD'S FIRST FLOATING NUCLEAR PLANT ...

Construction of the world's first floating nuclear power plant
is underway in Russia,  and engineers hope to have it ready to
operate by 2001,  a prospect that fills environmentalists with
horror but has Russia looking south for potential buyers.
   Andrei Gagarinsky,  vice  president  of the Russian Nuclear
Society and head of international relations at  the  Kurchatov
Institute in Moscow, confirmed to IPS this week that the first
of the plants was under construction after years of  financial
delays.
   But environmentalists contend that the threat of ecological
catastrophe  from  accidents  involving oil tankers will be as
nothing to a sea disaster involving a floating  nuclear  power
plant.
   Russia has long had  plans  to  build  a  series  of  small
floating  nuclear power plants for use in remote regions which
are not connected to the national grid or to  replace  thermal
nuclear  power plants that have grown too expensive because of
high fuel transportation costs.
   "Russia will  need  at  least 15 small,  low-power floating
nuclear power plants," says Gagarinsky.  "They will be used in
inaccessible  regions  of the Far East,  extreme North,  Altay
Territory and the Kola Peninsula."
   He noted  that  Russia is the world leader in small nuclear
power plant production and sees  them  as  potential  exports,
especially  to developing countries.  He added that Indonesia,
South Korea, China, and Vietnam have all expressed interest.
   But western  environmentalists are not convinced.  "A major
area of concern with these plants must be  containment,"  said
Antony Froggatt of the Greenpeace nuclear campaign in London.
   "The Chernobyl explosion blew the reactor lid,  a 2,000 ton
block of concrete,  into the air.  These vessels will not even
have that sort of protection.  This must pose a clear risk  to
both the marine and land environment."
   The floating plant is essentially a  ship  with  two  small
pressurized  water  reactors (PWRs) known as KLT-40s,  adapted
from those used to power Russia's nuclear icebreakers.
   The KLT-40   enhanced   safety   PWR,   designed   by  OKBM
Experimental Design Bureau of Mechanical Engineering in Nizhny
Novgorod,  has been used for over 20 years to power the USSR's
seven nuclear icebreakers as  well  as  nuclear-powered  cargo
ships.  During  this  time (over 130 reactor years) there have
been no major accidents involving the KLT.  The reactors  each
have a power output of 35-50 megawatts (MW),  giving the plant
an overall capacity of up to 100 MW of power  or  50  MW  plus
power   generating  heat.  Besides  the  OKBM,  the  Kurchatov
Institute in Moscow and  the  Aisberg  Design  Bureau  in  St.
Petersburg  were  involved in the design of the plant which is
now being built at the Baltisky Shipyard in St. Petersburg.
   The first  plant  will  be  sited  at the Arctic seaport of
Pivek in the Chukotka Peninsula in the far northeast.  It will
be operated by 40-50 people working in shifts and has a design
life of around 40 years.
   Spent fuel  and wastes will be stored on board and every 13
years it will be towed 4,000 kilometers through Arctic seas to
Murmansk  in  the  Kola  peninsula  in  Russia's northwest for
maintenance and reloading with fresh fuel.
   During this  procedure,  which  will take around a year,  a
substitute floating plant will be put in place. It is expected
to cost $254 million and will take six years to build.
   Electricity from the plant is expected  to  be  five  times
cheaper  than  from  any  other  source.  There  are around 50
suitable  sites  for  such  reactors  along  Russia's   Arctic
coastline.
   According to Alexander Poloushkin,  Director General of the
Malaya  Energetika Research and Production Association,  small
nuclear plants can contribute up to percent of the  power  and
heat  needed by these regions.  He insists that the plant will
be very safe.
   "The plant  has  reliable  protection  systems to safeguard
against all possible risks,  including sinking,  capsizing and
even an aircraft crashing on top of it,  " he says.  "It won't
pollute the area with any nuclear waste  because  it  will  be
stored on board."
   Similar opinions  were  expressed  by  Nikolai  Filozov,  a
spokesman  for  the  Russian  state  nuclear supervisory body,
Gosatomnadzor.
   But Froggatt  pointed out that most PWRs have problems with
their steam generators which can ultimately lead to  accidents
involving loss of coolant.

A ship  reactor  accident at a shipyard on the Russian Pacific
coast in 1985 killed several people  and  has  left  areas  of
Chazma Bay still contaminated.
   The largely state-owned Malaya Energetika ("Small  Energy")
company    is    hoping   to   market   the   reactor   design
internationally.  Poloushkin believes there is a market for at
least 100 and says his company is hoping to sell the plants to
China, Indonesia, the Philippines and other countries.
   Designs have been drawn up to use the KLT-40 as a basis for
a floating or shore-based  desalination  plant  (APVS-40),  an
underground  power plant and a shore-based power plant shipped
in by sea.  The APVS-40 which comprises  one  KLT-40  and  two
desalination  units,  can  supply up to 80,000 cubic meters of
water a day.
   The APVS-40   plant   was   designed   by  the  same  three
organizations  along  with  the  Yekaterinburg  Research   and
Development  Institute  of  Chemical  Mechanical  Engineering.
There has already been considerable interest  in  this  design
from  countries  in the Middle East,  Africa Latin America and
Asia.
   In 1992   The  Kurchatov  Institute  discussed  a  possible
contract  to  supply  a  plant  to  Israel,  but  negotiations
foundered  because  Israel  has  not  yet  signed  the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
   "We have  done  a range of studies for offshore and onshore
nuclear  power  plants  as  well  as  underground  plants  and
desalination stations based on the KLT-40," says OKBM Director
Fyodor Mitenkov.
   By simultaneous  manufacturing  the reactor,  floating base
and support facilities he  says  construction  time  could  be
reduced  to  as  little  as  three  and  a half years from the
signing of any contract  and  in  the  event  of  large  scale
manufacture unit costs could be reduced to $180 million each.

BIG DEMO AGAINST EXPANSION OF THE TEMPORARY STORE OF AHAUS AND
FOR THE CLOSURE OF ALL NUCLEAR PLANTS

The strong protest against the Castortransport to Gorleben has
turned the eyes of the public away from the temporary  storage
facility  in  Ahaus.  With  good  conscience  some politicians
consider now bringing the radioactive  waste  to  Ahaus  which
should go originally to Gorleben.
We don't  want  any nuclear waste dumps as long as radioactive
waste still is produced!
305 Castor-containers already  are  stored  in  the  temporary
nuclear  fuel  storage  site  of  Ahaus.  The  store  shall be
extended by the triple now.  This must be prevented  with  all
strength.
The red  green  coalition  of the country of NRW declares,  to
have withdrawn from the use of nuclear energy.  But apparently
it does not care about BEZ in Ahaus which in fact turns into a
permanent storage depot.  This store and the one  in  Gorleben
form  the  prerequisite  for  the  use  of  the atomic energy.
Without "waste  management  evidence"  -  as  the  stores  are
counted  for  - no nuclear power stations may be operated.  As
long as all nuclear power stations aren't switched off and the
amount  of  radioactive  waste  to dispose always is increased
further,  we aren't ready to discuss allegedly meaningful  and
sure waste management possibilities!
Against the  expansion of the BEZ-Ahaus we want to demonstrate
for the immediate turn energy of energy politics on 10-08-1996
in Ahaus (near Muenster)
The march  starts  at  the  city  hall place (Rathausplatz) at
11.00 hours.
This is  an  action  the  environment  cycle  tour  "Gegenwind
(headwind)".  "Gegenwind"  is  organized  by  a  team of young
people,  coordinated by the BUNDjugend NW (youth  organization
of  FoE Germany in Northrhine-Westfalia) with participation of
the departement for environment,  environmental  planning  and
farming ("Umweltministerium") in NRW.

Subject: NONVIOLENT DEFENSE: new book
Date: 28 Jul 1996 20:57:52 +1000

NONVIOLENT DEFENSE: new book

A book just published explains in detail how to develop a comprehensive
nonviolent strategy to resist all forms of military aggression. It offers
specific political and strategic guidance for resisting foreign military
intervention and/or occupation (of the type suffered by Tibet, Palestine
and East Timor) and for resisting internal military repression (of the type
suffered by Burma, China and Nigeria). The book is:

Robert J. Burrowes, `The Strategy of Nonviolent Defense: A Gandhian
Approach'. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996.
ISBN paperback: 0-7914-2588-6; ISBN hardcover: 0-7914-2587-8. 367 pages

The text of the SUNY Press book announcement follows:

"The author does an exceptional job at questioning underlying assumptions
(for example patriarchy, political realism, and the elitism of states). As
a scholar in the area of nonviolent defense in my own right, I found myself
personally benefited by this book's theme of moving beyond a statist
perspective on conflict toward one which recognizes the non-satisfying of
human needs as the cause of conflict." - Norman C. Freund, author of
`Nonviolent Defense: A Philosophical Inquiry into Applied Nonviolence'

"The author develops in clear prose, and with impressive documentation, a
persuasive approach to a strategy of nonviolent defense, which has not been
done before in such a systematic and comprehensive manner. The book's focus
is of great importance for conflict theory, international relations, and
the role of violence in inter-group relations." - Richard Falk, Princeton
University

Given the way in which the history of nonviolence has been marginalized,
relatively few people have a sense of the rich history of nonviolent
struggle or realize that it can be systematically planned and applied.
Nevertheless, the historical record illustrates that nonviolent struggle is
a powerful form of political action. But can it be effective against
military aggression?

`The Strategy of Nonviolent Defense' answers this question in the
affirmative by first defining the notion of "social cosmology" - the four
mutually reinforcing features that determine the character of any society.
It then devotes attention to strategies for dealing with conflict, in
particular, to developing a strategic theory and framework for planning a
strategy of nonviolent defense. In order to develop this theory, Burrowes
synthesizes insights drawn from the strategic theory of Carl von
Clausewitz, the nonviolence of Mahatma Gandhi, and recent human needs and
conflict theory.

Robert J. Burrowes has been a member of the Australian Nonviolence Network
since 1981 and has been involved in many nonviolent action campaigns. He is
best known for his war tax resistance, his involvement in the campaign of
the Melbourne Rainforest Action Group, and his membership in the Gulf Peace
Team. He now devotes all of his time to nonviolent activism, education, and
research.

The paperback costs $US16.95; the hardcover costs $US49.50; and postage
outside the USA costs $US4 for the first copy and $US1 for each copy
thereafter. The book can be paid for with a credit card and ordered from:

SUBJECT: STOP SEA' NUCLEAR TRANSIT !!!
         Action and faxes needed!
     
ON JULY 30, The "Amber-2" ship with nuclear materials (uranium
concentrate) arrived  to  the  waters  of Kaliningrad' region.
There is 19 of 23-f containers with uranium. The ship is going
from Sankt-Petersburgh  port  to the USA,  San-Francisco.

The non-governmental  organizations  are  protesting  the ship
entering to the Kaliningrad' port;  the  ship  is  staying  in
Kaliningrad' territorial    waters   and   waiting   for   the
opportunity to  enter the seaport or for additional directions
from the authorities.
     
There is no any necessary equipment for  the  operations  with
radioactive materials  in  the  seaports  of Kaliningrad.  The
Kaliningrad is not included in the governmental  list  of  the
ports which  can  operate  radioactive  materials.  That's the
violation of the Russian law "On the use of nuclear power"  (#
41) if  the  ship will enter to the port and the port and city
authorities will allow that.  Because of no special  equipment
the port  workers as well as all the population of Kaliningrad
region are  in  very  dangerous  situation  when  even   small
accident will  be  followed  by  very  serious consequences of
radioactive contamination of the land and the sea.
     
Ministry of   atomic  power  of  Russia  (Minatom)  and  their
enterprise "Isotop" (Sankt-Petersburgh) has  a  contract  with
american parties to transport the uranium.  It's still unclear
who are american partners for them.  But clear that Minatom is
trying to  use  the  seaport  of  Kaliningrad  to  transit the
dangerous radioactive   materials.  In  1993  non-governmental
organizations sent to the local parliament the law project for
nuclear-free zone  in  Kaliningrad region and demanded to stop
all the operations with radioactive  materials.
     
The campaign for nuclear free zone is still going on -  please
send your   fax-messages  to  numbers  below  to  support  the
campaign and to prevent extremely dangerous  the  entering  of
radioactive ship  to Kaliningrad seaport!  Below you also will
see the example of protest-fax-message which is  sent  out  by
different ex-USSR NGOs. There you'll see also more details.

If you can also help us to get information about this contract
(who are american contractor,  for what this uranium  will  be
used) - it would be greatest help we need now.

LET'S MAKE TOGETHER NUCLEAR-FREE EARTH !
STOP THE SEA NUCLEAR TRANSIT!
SEND FAXES OF PROTEST TO STOP NUCLEAR TRANSIT FOREVER!

example of letter
     
The head of regional Kaliningrad administration
-  Yury Matochkin (fax 7-0112-463862)
The major of Kaliningrad - Vitaly Shipov
(fax 7-0112-211677)
The chairman    of   governmental   environmental   protection
committee of Kaliningrad - Vladimir Litvinenko
(tel/fax 7-0112-210906)
"Kaliningradskaya pravda" newspaper (tel/fax 7-0112-217733)


We are,  ...  (name of organization)  ...,  sending  you  this
message to protest the sea nuclear transit through Kaliningrad
region. We also protest  Kaliningrad'  authorities  that  they
allow dangerous illegal transit.
     
On 30 of July  "Amber-2"  ship  with  uranium  concentrate  is
arrived to  Kaliningrad'  sea waters.  Because of Kaliningrad'
ports have no special equipment to  operate  with  radioactive
materials this  is  very  possible  that nuclear accident will
take place during operations on the ship in the port.  In case
of accident  the  lands and sea both will be contaminated.
     
The entering of the ship is illegal under russian laws "On the
use of nuclear power" (#41).  We aslo know that the ships with
radioactive materials  illegally  visited Kaliningrad' seaport
about 6 times already. In May of 1996, one soldier of the port
guard died with leukemia diagnosys.  This soldier wrote in own
message (May  11,  1996)  to  the  commander   that   he   was
hospitalized immediately  after  he  guarded  the  ships  with
radioactive materials in 1995.

We demand to stop sea nuclear transit and the  nuclear  threat
to the  population  of  Kaliningrad  and  Baltic  Sea  states.
Kaliningrad authorities, start to act immediately!

ILLEGAL NUCLEAR TRANSIT

Kaliningrad/Russia, July 29 (EDI),  - The secret  contract  on
nuclear  materials  transportation through one of the ports of
Kaliningrad,  a russian city near Baltic Sea, is working since
the  beginning  of  1996,  at least,  told unanimous source at
russian Kaliningrad' sea port on Sunday.  The source also told
that    the    nuclear    materials   are   sending   by   the
Sankt-Petersburgh'  company  "Isotop"  to  the   USA   through
Kaliningrad'  port.  It's  possible that the workers operating
materials  know  not  about  the   radioactivity   from.   The
Kaliningrad'   branch   of   GosAtomNadzor   (GAN  is  nuclear
supervisory body of  russian  president)  do  know  about  the
contract  but have no information about level of radioactivity
and the danger for port' workers.

Kaliningrad/Koenigsberg, July 30 (EDI), - The  "Amber-2"  ship
with nuclear  materials (uranium concentrate) arrived  to  the
waters of Kaliningrad' region.
There is 19 of 23-f containers with uranium. The ship is going
from Sankt-Petersburgh  port  to the USA,  San-Francisco.
The non-governmental  organizations  are  protesting  the ship
entering to the Kaliningrad' port;  the  ship  is  staying  in
Kaliningrad' territorial    waters   and   waiting   for   the
opportunity to  enter the seaport or for additional directions
from the authorities.
There is no any necessary equipment for  the  operations  with
radioactive materials  in  the  seaports  of Kaliningrad.  The
Kaliningrad is not included in the governmental  list  of  the
ports which  can  operate  radioactive  materials.  That's the
violation of the Russian law "On the use of nuclear power"  (#
41) if  the  ship will enter to the port and the port and city
authorities will allow that.  Because of no special  equipment
the port  workers as well as all the population of Kaliningrad
region are  in  very  dangerous  situation  when  even   small
accident will  be  followed  by  very  serious consequences of
radioactive contamination of the land and the sea.
Ministry of   atomic  power  of  Russia  (Minatom)  and  their
enterprise "Isotop" (Sankt-Petersburgh) has  a  contract  with
american parties to transport the uranium.  It's still unclear
who are american partners for them.  But clear that Minatom is
trying to  use  the  seaport  of  Kaliningrad  to  transit the
dangerous radioactive   materials.  In  1993  non-governmental
organizations sent to the local parliament the law project for
nuclear-free zone  in  Kaliningrad region and demanded to stop
all the operations with radioactive  materials.
If you want to support NGOs protesting sea nuclear transit   -
ask the editor for the message of support which you'll need to
send by fax.
PS. On August 1, EDI have got new information that the uranium
is  going  from  Kazakhstan  and  can  be  like the payment of
Kazakhstan to the US for some contracts or credits.

ACCIDENT AT NUCLEAR PLANT KILLED WORKER

TWO ACCIDENTS  AT UKRAINIAN NUCLEAR PLANT KILL WORKER,  RELEASE
RADIATION. Two accidents at the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant
on  25  July killed an employee and leaked radiation inside the
station,  Western and Ukrainian agencies reported the same day.
The  incidents  occurred  as the station's only working reactor
was being tested for a planned restart since it was  shut  down
on 20 April for maintenance. One employee sustained fatal inju-
ries and burns when a steam pipe burst during the testing.  Se-
veral  hours  later,  radioactive  water leaked into a nitrogen
storage area after workers failed to make a safety check. Plant
managers  said  radioactive contamination was limited to inside
the plant and that the leaks measured level three on the IAEA's
seven-level scale for nuclear accidents.  Chrystyna Lapychak

SACRED EARTH NETWORK' SEMINAR FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS

On July  12-14,  the  Sacred  Earth  Network held a seminar in
Nakhabino (a suburb of Moscow) for environmental activists who
concentrate  on  alternative  energy  and  sustainable  living
issues.  The seminar was  run  in  cooperation  with  Golubka,
ECOLOGIA,  and  the Center for Information and Coordination of
the  Socio-Ecological  Union  (CCI-SEU)  and  was   aimed   at
promoting   increased   communication   and   cooperation   on
alternative energy work in Eurasia.

The seminar begin with team building excercizes led by Golubka
staff  and  ended with an on-line Internet training session at
the offices of  CCI-SEU  lead  by  Alexander  Georgievsky  and
Sergei   Diamon   (Ecoline).  Seminar  participants  exchanged
information on  funding  sources,  approaches  to  information
management and proposed future cooperative work.

Upon conclusion   of   the   seminar   and   working   groups,
participants  agreed  to  initiate  an  e-mail  conference  to
formulate  a  project  proposal  for  increasing  awareness on
alternative  energy  and  sustainable  living  systems  across
Eurasia.

The list  of  the  seminar participants (14 representatives of
environmental NGOs in ex-USSR) can be sent on request.

Subject: STOP SEA NUCLEAR TRANSPORT, NEWS, message 2


August 2, 1996
THE SHIP WITH RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS ENTERED NOT THE PORT STILL!

Campaign of environmental protests is still keeping the ship 
"Amber-2" with uranium (?) out of Kaliningrad' port. 
The ship arrived to Kaliningrad' waters on July 30 from 
Sankt-Petersburgh and having the target San-Francisco, USA. 
Environmentalists demands to close port for all the ships with 
radioactive materials in the future and to send "Amber-2" out of
Kaliningrad' territorial waters. The ship is staying near the 
water entrance to the seaport fourth day. 19 containers with
uranium concentrate are waiting for the accident.
There is no any equipment for operations with radioactive materials 
in the port, there is no trained people who know how to organize
the protection of workers from radioactivity and the prevention
of accidents in the port. On 20 of May, 1996, the soldier died
from leukemia - he guarded same ship with radioactive materials
in 1995 at Kaliningrad seaport.
The ship has no own guard (the seaport too) and any terroristical 
act will result as contamination of the sea and the lands.

DEVELOPMENTS

As we know from the message of the director of the Kaliningrad' 
seaport (we've got on July 31) the Head of Kaliningrad regional 
administration - Yury Matochkin signed the document (some monthes
ago) forcing the port administration to serve nuclear ships. It's,
of course, giving him not better chances to win next elections this
autumn. 
The source at MCHS (Ministry of Accident Situations) told us today
that MCHS inspectors are not sure that Minatom (Ministry of Atomic
Power) told them the truth about that ship. It's possible that the 
ship transports nuclear wastes!
The source at Nature Protection Committee of Kaliningrad informed
that the uranium (if it's uranium) is from Kazakhstan, not russian.
The port authorities reports that the ship must stay in the seaport 
untill August 5. Then it will go away to San-Francisco.
The port authorities said that the ship must take from Kaliningrad'
seaport unknown equipment and the cars.

MEDIA

Since the press-release, environmentalists sent out on July 30,
american radio "Svoboda" (Freedom) and Radio of Russia distributed
information about the ship to all around former USSR. The main 
political newspaper in Russia "Izvestia" is preparing the article 
at present time. Local media in Kaliningrad published and broadcasted
a lot. Like governmental radio agency in Kaliningrad broadcasted very
environmentalist-friendly special news issue this morning. 

INTERVIEWS

Last 3 days we interviewed some officials in Kaliningrad:
Correspondent: Do you know about the ship with uranium?

1. Regional administration:
No answer.

2. Vice-Major of the city: 
Uranium? it's terrible! what to do?

3. Regional committee of nature protection: 
No, we know about this ship nothing.

4. Gosatomnadzor (nuclear control organization of president): 
It's not dangerous.
Cor.: How do you know? Have you any information about the ship?
G.: No, we have no information, but it's not dangerous.

5. The port authorities:
The head of regional administration commanded to organize the
service for this ship. We should work on this ship or we'll loose
our jobs.


ACTION

Please, send your faxes to all the numbers we gave you in alert-messgage!
If you have not this message, we'll send you copy again - just let
us know. Since July 30, several ex-USSR and US NGOs sent some faxes.
Thanks a lot. And we still need more! We need your support now!
We demand the nuclear-free zone in Kaliningrad region.

JOURNALISTS' RIGHTS ARE VIOLATED

MOSCOW (E-C) Belarus, Russia, Tadjikistan, and Ukraine are the
republics   where   journalists'   rights  are  violated  most
frequently and grossly,  according to Oleg Panfilov,  head  of
the  monitoring  service  of  the  Glasnost Defence Foundation
(GDF), speaking at a press-conference on 22 July.
Panfilov presented the Foundation's account on  violations  of
journalists'  rights,  based on the information of Russian and
the foreign press,  human rights organisations  and  the  GDF.
Panfilov  pointed  to  the  murder  in  late June of Aleksandr
Motrenko,  an  employee  of  the  Simferopol   radio   station
"Trans-m-radio," by officers of the law-enforcement organs, as
a particularly serious attack on the press.

NIZHNI TAGIL JOURNALISTS ON HUNGER STRIKE

NIZHNI TAGIL.  For a fourth day Pavel Gross,  a journalist  of
the municipal television studio "Tagil-TV," has been on hunger
strike.  One of his colleagues told "Express-Chronicle" on  22
July  that the basic condition for the cessation of his hunger
strike was the payment of arrears in wages to  all  "Tagil-TV"
employees for May and June this year.

KGB GUIDE-BOOK

MOSCOW (E-C)  The  launching  of  the  book  "KGB Guide to the
cities of the world" was held on 24 July in  the  premises  of
the External Intelligence Service (SVR) of Russia. The book is
presented as "an original guide book,  which will  familiarise
the  reader  with  the  sights  of cities,  [and] recount many
unknown facts from the history of espionage." It was issued by
"Sovershenno Sekretno" publishers,  with a print-run of 20,000
copies.
The preface,  written by  Yuri  Senkevich  of  the  television
programme  "Traveller's Club," states that the "book is unique
not  only  in  its  contents,  but  also  in  its  authors   -
professionals from the external intelligence of the former KGB
of the USSR,  who in various years worked in New York, London,
Rome,  Paris,  Cairo, Mexico and Bangkok." Most of the authors
of the book attended the launching:  Leonid  Kolosov,  Mikhail
Liubimov,  Lev  Bausin,  Oleg Brykin and Pavel Yefremov.  Yuri
Kobaladze,  head of SVR's centre for public  liason,  declared
that "the intelligence [service] received no money,  no income
and royalties from the publication of the guide book" and  the
"the  SVR  presented  the  book  because it was written by our
former agents."

                NUCLEAR WORKERS STOP SIT-IN

By Yevgenia Borisova

The workers  of  the  nuclear  power  plant  in  Sosnovy   Bor
suspended  their  sit-in  Friday last week for the second time
this month when they learned that their director's resignation
was accepted by the minister of atomic energy of Russia.
Alexander Barantsov,   head  of  the  Leningrad  Atomic  Power
Station's (LAES) trade union,  said,  "We suspended the action
until  August  8  when  we  got  the  signed order that [plant
director Anatoly] Yeperin is gone  and  the  new  acting  head
assured  us  that they are working on a plan to get out of the
crisis situation."
Beginning in mid-June,  the workers,  who said they  have  not
been paid for three months, were arranging meetings of protest
and sit-ins at the plant,  urging the LAES management  to  pay
their wages.
Barantsov said LAES owed the employees about 30 billion rubles
($6 million) in unpaid wages dating  back  to  the  middle  of
April.
LAES management  said they did not have enough cash to pay the
wages,  because 95 percent of their financial  operations  are
barter deals.
Barantsov said   Monday   that  Valery  Lebedev,  LAES'  chief
engineer,  who was approved as acting head of  LAES  beginning
July 29,  promised to provide a plan for management changes at
LAES by August 2.
He added that by August 7 a plant to repay the  workers  would
be prepared by LAES management, and a draft plan to get out of
the crisis will be ready by August 9.
Barantsov said he believed this week's meetings with the heads
of  workshops  and  departments  at LAES will help to create a
plan for coping with the crisis,  and  that  he  expects  that
Leningrad  Oblast  Governor  Alexander  Belyakov would come to
LAES to speak to the workers this week.
Lebedev was not available for comment Monday.
The LAES is a Chenobyl-type nuclear power plant located in the
town  of  Sosnovy Bor,  approximately 70 kilometers (43 miles)
northeast of St Petersburg.

     RUSSIA TO REPAY LOANS WITH URANIUM, HELICOPTERS

SEOUL - Russia will repay part of  South  Korea's  loans  with
enriched  uranium  and helicopters instead of steel as earlier
agreed on, the Finance and Economy Ministry announced today.
The replacement of loan payment items was agreed upon after  a
meeting  in Moscow late last month between the two sides,  the
ministry said.
Under the agreement,  Russia will supply,  instead  of  steel,
enriched uranium worth 75 million U.S. dollars and helicopters
worth 15 million dollars.
Besides the enriched uranium and helicopters,  Russia is  also
supposed  to  provide South Korea within the year with defense
equipment worth 154  million  dollars,  aluminium  51  million
dollars, enriched uranium 18 million dollars and helicopters 8
million dollars.
Of the loans totaling 1.47  billion  dollars  Russia  obtained
from  South  Korea,  Moscow had repaid 40.4 million dollars in
kind by the end of July last year -- 19.3 million  dollars  in
aluminium  and  21.1  million dollars in helicopters.

SPECIAL ISSUE: ALEXANDR NIKTIN - HALF A YEAR IN KGB CUSTODY
               ALEXANDR LEBED ASKS PROSECUTOR ON NIKITIN
---------------------------------------------------------------

ALEXANDR NIKITIN, AUGUST 6, 1996: HALF A YEAR IN KGB CUSTODY

On August 6,  Bellona co-worker Alexandr Nikitin has been held
in custody in the FSB prison in St. Petersburg for six months;
after having been arrested on charges of espionage on February
6, 1996.

Since then,  the  Russian security police FSB - formerly KGB -
has committed a series of judicial and human rights violations
against the environmentalist. The case has achieved noticeable
attention internationally,  and several important persons  and
institutions    have    voiced   criticism   towards   Russian
authorities.

Nikitin has been jailed because of his work as co-author on  a
report  on the nuclear hazards of the Russian North Fleet,  to
be launched in its final edition  by  Norwegian  environmental
foundation  Bellona  on August 15.  The FSB accuses Nikitin of
having  disclosed  state  secrets  for  payment.  Nikitin,  in
addition  to his present occupation as environmental activist,
is a pensioned captain of 1st rank in the Russian navy.

As an employee of the Bellona  Foundation,  Nikitin  obviously
has  received  payment.  The  report  on  the  Northern Fleet,
however, is based on open sources in its entirety.

The indictment  is  based  on  alleged  breaches  against  two
decrees  from the Russian Ministry of Defence.  The decrees in
question are <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> secret,  that Nikitin's lawyer,  after half  a
year, has not been allowed to see them.

The paragraph  in  question - Z 64 of the Russian Penal Code -
states Death Penalty as one of its punishmental options.

ALEXANDER LEBED ASKS PROSECUTOR GENERAL OF RUSSIA TO LOOK INTO
NIKITIN CASE

On July  19 a group of deputies of the Russian Parliament made
a request to Secretary of Russian Federation Security  Council
Alexander  Lebed  concerning  legal  proceedings  in Alexander
Nikitin case.  The request was passed by the majority of  Duma
members and was delivered to Alexander Lebed on July 22.

On July   26   Lebed  responded  to  the  request  asking  the
Prosecutor General of Russia Juriy Skuratov  to  consider  the
deputies request.  On July 31 the Office of Prosecutor General
of Russia declared that they were  going  to  investigate  the
case  and  report  about  the results to the deputies of State
Duma.

Alexander Nikitin is Bellona's co-worker who was arrested  and
accused of espionage by FSB and has been kept in FSB's custody
in St.-Petersburg for  half  a  year  till  now.  The  charges
against  Nikitin are based upon chapter 8 of the new Bellona's
report "The Russian Northern Fleet -  sources  to  radioactive
contamination   of   the  region".  The  chapter  reveals  the
information   on   the   accidents   onboard   nuclear-powered
submarines.

Rostov Nuclear Power Plant is about to be put into operation
STOP NUCLEAR MADNESS!
HELP US TO PREVENT A NEW CHERNOBYL!

Dear READERS of this message,
Russia is about to get a new potential Chernobyl!
Rostov Nuclear Power Plant is about to be put into operation.
Ex-USSR Antinuclear campaign is urgently asking you to help
put a stop to this nuclear plant.

I hope that almost everybody who reads this letter  already
knows  about  the antinuclear campaign's big victory
against nuclear shipping on the seas. Many of you helped us with
that.
As an organizer of this campaign I would like to note that this campa-
ign was  successful  thanks to several hundred people who read the mail
from the Ex-USSR Antinuclear campaign and ECODEFENSE! group.

But the "war" is not over yet.  Today I would like to ask you to  sup-
port  our  new  fax-campaign  against the proposed operation of Rostov
NPP!  Now the situation is crucial; and we all have the chance to  persuade
local  authorities not to make the decision to put the NPP into opera-
tion and commit a new crime against humankind and nature.  We need  to
influence  their  decision  and  it is very easy to do this - just send
your fax against the NPP to the fax-numbers which you can find on  the
second page.

It is very possible that we will be able to persuade local authorities
to give up their decision to put the NPP  into  operation  because  of
their  undefined  position.  We  should do this.  We know that nuclear
energy is in deep crisis in many countries.  It is very expensive  and
dangerous.  In Russia for the last several years the Ministry fo Atomic 
Energy (MinAtom) could not put into operation any of the proposed  new  
NPPs.  And now  everyone can make a difference and change the situation
by sending its fax. We should prevent MinAtom from the expansion of their 
activities. Otherwise they will continue to destroy our nature and spend 
our money on the creation of new NPPs.

Take action.  We know that the fax-campaign is a very  effective  tool
and we should use this tool.

Who and why doesn't want the operation of the Rostov NPP?

  Today Anti-Nuclear  Campaign  appeals to you to send your faxes aga-
inst Rostov NPP.  We are against all  nuclear  facilities  because  we
think that nuclear energy is expensive and  dangerous. Because  of 
its difficult economical situation, Russia is not able to develop its  
nuclear program.  Very soon we will need to shut down most of the 
existing nuclear reactors which will cost Russia about 3 billion dollars. 
Also the utilization  of exissting nuclear wastes is still an 
unresolvable problem and nobody knows how to deal with this problem.  At 
the same time Rostov  region  has very great energy potential including 
renewable energy sources. For these reasons Rostov region doesn't need 
nuclear energy!
 
    Anti-Nuclear Campaign works together with many  other  organisati-
ons. This action is organized with collaboration of organization "Gre-
en Don".  "Green Don" is professionally working against the Rostov NPP.
It  prepared  a report about the NPP and organized the public envi-
ronmental impact asessment. The asessment showed that the construction
of the NPP will seriously destroy the fish population in surrounding are-
as. It also showed that the construction was made with many violations.
Also  the  project for construction was designed in 1970 and therefore
has no protection systems.
   The population of all adjacent regions including regions of Ukraine
are strongly opposed to the construction. In last July local populati-
on organised several meeting against the operation of the NPP.
 
   Another organization which takes part in the  campaign  is  Rainbow
Keepers. They are organizing the protest camp near the NPP.


WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW
   The French company Electricite de France suggested local authorities
put the NPP in 1997.  The company is ready to give a credit to  fi-
nish  the construction and to take part in the construction using this
credit.  (Rostov region doesn't have money to finish the  plant).  Now
EdF  needs 350 mln dollars but it is evident that the sum will be big-
ger because French companies usually underestimate the expenses.
    First unit is ready on 95 %. The suggested type of reactor is the 
infamous VVR-1000. Only this year there were several accidents with
this type of reactor in Ukraine.

WHERE TO  SEND FAXES
   If you  would  like to know how to write your faxes we are ready to
give you an example.  Just send us a letter.  In your faxes we suggest
you politely ask local authorities not to make a decision about the
continuation of construction.  You should emphasize that the continua-
tion  will lead to a financial crisis and destroy nature and the health 
of surrounding population.

POLICE VIOLENCE AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS


A special   police'   guard   attacked   the  action  camp  of
environmentalists near Rostov Nuclear  Power  plant  today  at
4.00  in  the  morning.  The action camp started on August 10,
close  to  the  nuclear  power  plant  located  10  km.   from
Volgodonsk  city  (Rostov-na-Donu' region).  The Nuclear power
plant is about to be put into operation.

Some activists were injured by  the  police,  medical  experts
confirmed when they arrived to the camp later.

The policemen  threated  environmentalists  with  the guns and
confiscated their camera equipment.  The police' guard  didn't
show their identifications,  the environmentalists didn't know
for sure who this people with guns were.

The construction of nuclear power plant is against law because
it  located  in  10 km from the closest city.  The law require
that the NPP be located 25 km from the closest city.

Community leaders have been protesting the construction  since
the   late   1980s.  Because  of  mass-protests,  the  plant's
construction has been frozen since 1990.

HEAD:   bulgaria to build waste treatment facilities

       sofia, august 21 (bta) - the contract on the construction of
 waste treatment facilities in the metallurgical plant in elisseina,
 northern bulgaria, will be signed by the year's end, 'continent'
 says.

       the first group of environmental experts of the japanese jci
 consultancy institute of metallurgy arrived here yesterday.

       they will prepare the tender dossiers and name the project           
 contractor. the construction will start in march 1997, and should be       
 completed after 39 months.

       the japanese experts guarantee that the facilities will
 minimize up to 90 per cent sulphur dioxide pollution of the air and
 95 per cent of the heavy metal pollutants of water and soil.

       an intergovernmental agreement to this effect was signed a year
 ago.  the agreement includes the elisseina plant and the nonferrous
 metal works in plovdiv, southern bulgaria.

       the environmental project will be funded by a japanese bank which    
 extended a credit of usd 20 million.

Subject: AIHA Partnership Opportunity--Albania


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE					
August 15, 1996

Health Care Alliance/USAID Seek US Health Care Institutions for 
Partnership Project in Albania

WASHINGTON, DC -- The American International Health Alliance, Inc. (AIHA)
and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) announce
the solicitation of proposals for a health care partnership program in
Tirana, Albania.  AIHA is soliciting expressions of interest from qualified
US hospitals and health care institutions willing to devote substantial
in-kind resources, mainly in the form of human resources committed on a
volunteer basis, to a two-year partnership with counterparts in Albania.

This health care partnership is part of an ongoing health care development
program financed through USAID and managed by AIHA which includes forty
partnerships in nine countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and
eleven republics of the former Soviet Union.  AIHA partnerships have enabled
American health care providers to work with their colleagues abroad to
address significant mortality and morbidity issues, improve health care
organization and introduce market-oriented solutions to health system
delivery problems.  The emphasis of the program is on professional exchanges
involving physicians, nurses, administrators and technicians.  AIHA
partnerships also collaborate with related ministries of health, local and
regional health administrations, and schools of health sciences to ensure
that critical areas of health education and administration are adequately
addressed at these higher institutional levels, and that the capacity to
carry out other developmental assistance efforts is enhanced.

The Albania hospital partnership will share certain goals with existing CEE
partnerships, namely improving medical and technological knowledge,
expanding the role of nursing, and enhancing institutional management and
financing skills.  

The Albanian partners are located in the capital city of Tirana and consist
of three hospitals -- University Hospital Center, University Hospital of
Obstetrics and Gynecology (known as the Maternity Hospital), and Central
Trauma Hospital.   

	The University Hospital Center of Tirana serves as the country's primary
teaching hospital for the University of Tirana Medical School and as the
leadership institution for the country's public health system, which
includes 50 hospitals in 35 districts.


	The Maternity Hospital operates 500 beds in three buildings, covering
obstetrics, gynecology, and neonatology.  It is the largest maternity center
in Albania and serves as a major referral center for obstetrics and
neonatology.  It houses the recently-opened, AIHA-supported Mother and Child
Health Information Center which provides both information resources for
physicians and nurses as well as health promotion and education for new parents.

	The Central Trauma Hospital currently serves as the city's receiving
hospital for all orthopedic trauma care.  In the future, through the
Ministry of Health's project for reorganization of medical emergency units
in hospitals throughout the country, this hospital will be part of a broader
network of trauma centers.

These three Albanian partner institutions have participated since 1994 in
AIHA's partnership program with another US health care institution.  AIHA
and USAID expect that the new partnership will continue to focus on women
and infants health, emergency medical services, nursing, and
management/administration.  The US and Albanian partners will collaborate to
identify other priority clinical areas.  Their work in
management/administration will be closely coordinated with AIHA's health
management education partnership in Albania between New York University and
the Ministry of Health and University of Tirana.

In addition, the partnership is expected to develop community-based programs
addressing health promotion and disease prevention needs.  This "healthy
communities" component will involve multi-sector community participation
that encourages local leaders to work together to determine local priorities
and implement community-based intervention strategies.

AIHA/USAID is not the principal funding source for partnership activities,
but rather supplements the voluntary and in-kind contributions of the
partners and their respective communities in the US and abroad.  Existing
AIHA partnerships have leveraged nearly three dollars of voluntary support
for every US government dollar expended.  AIHA/USAID funds will mainly
support travel and other costs essential in establishing and realizing the
full potential of a partnership program, including communication and
interaction with other partnerships.  AIHA staff in Washington, DC and in
Europe will provide logistical support and assist in monitoring the progress
of the partnership.  

Interested US partners must have the willingness and capacity to meet the
specific health care delivery needs described above, and must satisfy the
following criteria:

 	Be institution-based -- e.g., a hospital, group of hospitals or health
care system.  If a group of institutions is involved, a lead institution
must be designated.

 	Be supported by the institution's senior leadership and Board and clearly
identify an overall partnership coordinator.

 	Make a substantial voluntary commitment to the partnership through a
significant contribution of resources, including human resources.

 	Have experience implementing successful "healthy communities" or other
community outreach projects.

 	Actively involve the local community served by the US partners, including
any significant emigre community that may be present.

 	Share information openly and participate fully in AIHA's efforts to
exchange information with other US/CEE and US/NIS partnerships through the
AIHA Partnership Clearinghouse and dissemination conferences and seminars.

 	Adhere to AIHA's rigorous objective-setting and results-oriented approach,
including:

	(a)	Enter into a formal Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and work within
the overall coordination and guidance of AIHA and its designated program
coordinator;

	(b)	Develop demonstration-type interventions with significant training
components and capacity for replication;

	(c)	Establish mechanisms (such as training programs and conferences) for
the dissemination of partnership successes; and

	(d)	Participate in regular program evaluations to assess partnership
progress and achievements.

Hospitals or health care institutions wishing to be considered for
participation in the Albania partnership should send a short statement (10
pages maximum) by September 15, 1996 detailing their interest and ability to
enter into a collaborative relationship with Albanian partners under the
AIHA model.  The statement should describe the institution's commitment to
the partnership program, the human and material resources it will devote to
a partnership, and specific strengths of the institution that enhance its
ability to address the needs of the Albanian partners.  Working with USAID
and an outside advisory panel, AIHA will select the institution or group of
institutions which best match the needs of the Albanian partners, best
fulfill the criteria listed above, and offer the greatest potential for
sustaining a partnership beyond the availability of AIHA funding.



Statements should be directed to :

VICTORY OF "STOP NUCLEAR SHIPPING!" CAMPAIGN

ON JULY 30, The "Amber-2" ship with nuclear materials (uraniumconcentrate) arrived  to  the  waters  of Kaliningrad' region.There were  19  of 23-f containers with uranium.  The ship was
going from Sankt-Petersburgh  port  to the USA, San-Francisco.
"Amber-2" was  planning  to  visit Kaliningrad seaport to take
additional equipment for the carrying it to the USA.
The ex-USSR Antinuclear Campaign  received  information  about
dangerous transport  from own sources in Kaliningrad and imme-
diately started the fax-attack of local authorities.  The  de-
mands of the campaign were: 1) to close seaport for any nucle-
ar transit;  2) to accept by the regional  administration  the
regional status  of  territory without nuclear power,  nuclear
weapon and nuclear transit.

Comments 1:
The ex-USSR  Antinuclear  campaign  was founded by ECODEFENSE!
group (Baltic Sea region)  and  Socio-Ecological  Union  Int'l
(the  union  of  about  250  grassroot environmental groups in
ex-USSR). These two NGOs were campaigning in 1993 to stop nuke
transit  through Kaliningrad when first nuclear shipping there
took place.  From 1993,  the ECODEFENSE!  started to fight for
nuclear-free  zone with no opportunity for nuke transit in Ka-
liningrad region.
"

Parallel to fax-attack, the campaign started to organize local
resistance to nuclear shipping. Also, together with some jour-
nalists the campaign started the dialogue with local authority
to force them for "nuclear-free zone" decision immediately.

Some officials of Kaliningrad authorities were interviewed  in
the begining of the campaign:
Correspondent - Do you know about the ship with uranium?
1. Regional administration: No answer.
2. Vice-Major of the city: Uranium? it's terrible! what to do?
3. Regional committee of nature protection:  No, we know about
this ship nothing.
4. Gosatomnadzor (nuclear control organization of  president):
It's not dangerous. Cor.: How do you know? Have you any infor-
mation about the ship?  G.:  No,  we have no information,  but
it's not dangerous.
5. The  port authorities:  The head of regional administration
commanded to organize the service for  this  ship.  We  should
work on this ship or we'll loose our jobs.
Comments 2:  Ministry  of atomic power of Russia (Minatom) and
their enterprise "Isotop" (Sankt-Petersburgh) has  a  contract
with  american  parties  to transport the uranium.  It's still
unclear who are american partners for them. But clear that Mi-
natom  is  trying to use the seaport of Kaliningrad to transit
the dangerous radioactive materials.  In 1993 non-governmental
organizations sent to the local parliament the law project for
nuclear-free zone in Kaliningrad region and demanded  to  stop
all the operations with radioactive materials.
"

The reasons why NGOs wants to stop this transit are very clear.
There is no any necessary equipment for  the  operations  with
radioactive materials in the seaports of Kaliningrad.  The Ka-
liningrad is not included in  the  governmental  list  of  the
ports which can operate radioactive materials. That's the vio-
lation of the Russian law "On the use of nuclear power" (# 41)
if  the ship will enter to the port and the port and city aut-
horities will allow that.  Because of no special equipment the
port  workers as well as all the population of Kaliningrad re-
gion are in very dangerous situation when even small  accident
will  be  followed by very serious consequences of radioactive
contamination of the land and the sea.

Comments 3: On 20 of May, 1996, the soldier died from leukemia
- he  guarded  same ship with radioactive materials in 1995 at
Kaliningrad seaport.
"

The ship was staying in Kaliningrad'  territorial  waters  and
waiting for  the opportunity to enter the seaport or for addi-
tional directions from the authorities for more than  two  we-
eks. That  time The ex-USSR antinuclear campaign was trying to
talk with local authorities and this talking was supported  by
internatinal faxes very effectively.  Thanks to several people
from Europarliament,  Greenpeaces of Russia,  Sweden and  USA,
other NGOs and some UN' awarded physicians the authorities un-
derstood also that international public opinion  is  attracted
for situation  in  Kaliningrad,  that NGOs are still powerfull
and alive in Russia.
    
Since the July 30 press-release of the  antinuclear  campaign,
american radio "Svoboda" (Freedom) and Radio of Russia distri-
buted information about the ship to all  around  former  USSR.
The main political newspaper in Russia "Izvestia" prepared the
article about. Local media in Kaliningrad published and broad-
casted a  lot.  The  governmental  radio agency in Kaliningrad
broadcasted very environmentalist-friendly special news  issue
against nuclear shipping.
    
The head  of  regional Kaliningrad administration Yury Matoch-
kin, the major of Kaliningrad Vitaly Shipov,  the chairman  of
governmental environmental protection committee of Kaliningrad
Vladimir Litvinenko and local mass-media have received totally
about 15  international faxes protesting the nuclear shipping.
The campaign also organized the phone call'  action  in  Kali-
ningrad that  resulted in some thousands of calls of local ci-
tizens asking the administration of Kaliningrad  region  about
nuclear shipping.

Finally, the result of two weeks dialogue, phone call' action,
international fax pressure and effective work with  press  was
local authority' decision to give no permission for the nucle-
ar transit. The ex-USSR antinuclear campaign did one more step
to the nuclear-free zone  in Kaliningrad region.

The nuclear  industry  have lost up to million of US $ because
of antinuclear campaign' protests. At present time, the Baltic
Marine Prosecution started to investigate the case and sent to
Kaliningrad seaport' authority the message demanding  to  stop
any nuclear transit through Kaliningrad until the case will be
inmvestigated finally.

PRESS-RELEASE
AUGUST 13, 1996

LITHUANIA: EIB LOAN FOR ROAD  UPGRADING VIA BALTICA

The European Investment Bank (EIb), the long-term financing
institution of the European Union, is providing ECU 20 million
for the rehabilitation of the  internationally  important  Via
Baltica road in Lithuania.  The 20 year EIB loan to the Repub-
lic of Lithuania will be used by the Lithuanian Road Administ-
ration  (LRA)  for upgrading a road section between Kaunas and
the Polish border to a 2-lane highway.  Works  will  start  in
1997 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2000.
    Via Baltica is the most important road link  between  Hel-
sinki  and Warsaw through Estonia,  Latvia and Lithuania.  The
most important upgrading needs are in Lithuania.  The EIB loan
is to cover some 34 %  of the rehabilitation which is also re-
ceiving financial support from the European Bank  for  Recons-
truction and Development (EBRD) and from the Nordic Investment
Bank (NIB).  The EU-Phare Programme is concentrating its grant
aid  financing  to improve border crossing.  The nearby Polish
sections are being upgraded with the help of the World Bank.
    The development  of  a  reliable route linking Helsinki to
Warsaw is being prommoted by the Via Baltica  Monitoring  Com-
mittee, involving senior officials from all countries involved
and the European Commission,  and supported by the Swedish and
Finnish Governments which provide the committee's chairmanship
and secretariat respectively.  Commenting the  loan,  EIB  Vi-
ce-President Woifgang Roth said: "The importance of Via Balti-
ca for all countries in the region, including the Nordic coun-
tries and the European Union,  is well known to the EIB.  With
regard to Lithuania, the project will strengthen its role as a
transit country,  accelerate regional economic cooperation and
facilitate the country's integration into the European Union."
    Note to the Editor: EIB lending in Central and Eastern Eu-
    rope takes place under
a mandate  from  the Bank's Board of Governors (the fifteen EU
Finance Ministers) and is  concentrated  in  eleven  countries
linked to the EU under cooperation agreements.  The total aut-
horised for the period 1990-95 is ECU 4.7 billion of which <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a>-
me  ECU  3.9  billion have <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a> far been provided:  Poland (1126
million),  Hungary (832 million), the Czech Republic (737 mil-
lion), Romania (385 million), Bulgaria (286 million), Slavakia
(253 million),  Slovenia (120 million),  Estonia (68 million),
Lithuania  (59  million),  Albania  (34 million) and Latvia (5
million).  A new mandate for EIB lending in the CEECs for  the
period 1997-2000 is expected soon.
    For further details,  please contact the EIB's Information
and  Communications Department (Mr Max Messner,  tel 352 43 79

    The conversion  rates used by the EIB for statistical pur-
poses during  the  current  ouarter  are  these  obtaining  on
31/03/96, when ECU 1 = DEM 1.89, 5.02876 LTL.

UKRAINE
     
Khmelnitsky nuclear   reactor   shut    down    after    leak,
KIEV/Ukraine, -  The  reactor at the Khmelnitsky nuclear power
plant has been shut down  because  of  a  leaking  turbine,  a
Nuclear Ministry spokeswoman said Friday, August 30.
Water escaped  from  the system but it was not radioactive and
didnot pose any danger,  said Tatyana Yagish.  The reactor was
shut down Thursday  and  was  to  be  restarted  Tuesday.  The
Khmelnitsky nuclear  power  plant is located 150 miles west of
Kiev.

DEVELOPMENT OF KHMELNITSK  AND  ROVNO  NUCLEAR  POWER  PLANTS,
Kiev/Ukraine, -  according  to  the  agreement between G-7 and
Ukraine two ukrainian  nuclear  reactors  replacing  Chernobyl
are under    construction,    said   Nikolay   Shevchenko,   a
spokesperson for "Energoproekt" scientific institute in  Kiev.
The unit  4  of Rovno NPP and the unit 2 of Khmelnitsk NPP,  a
million KWT each,  will be completed by ENAK  -  transnational
energy consorcium.  ENAK signed the contract by May 1996,  the
cost of contract  is  about  $  10  million.  The  funding  is
provided by the European Union' foundations.

LITHIANIA

IGNALINA NUCLEAR POWER PLANT,  LITHUANIA - AN ACCIDENTAL STEAM
DISCHARGE  at  the  plant  on August 7 caused no danger to the
environment and  no  radiation  was  leaked,  said  an nuclear
energy official.  "There was an accidental discharge of  steam
from a  secondary system and it made a loud noise,  but it was
not dangerous," said the acting  director  of  the  Lithuanian
Nuclear Safety Inspectorate,  Mikhail Demchemko.  He explained
that the mishap occurred when a valve was  opened  to  release
extra pressure.    Ignalina,   home   to   the   two   largest
Chernobyl-style reactors in the former Soviet Union,  has been
the site of a number of accidents in recent years.  Fire broke
out in Ignalina's turbine room last November,  and in  another
incident two cranes became entangled while replacing fuel rods
in a reactor.  Under the terms of a 33 million  ECU  agreement
with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the
plant  is  slated  for  closure  around the year 2010 when its
reactor will need to be replaced.

LATVIA-LITHUANIA --   THE  STEAM  DISCHARGE  AT  THE  IGNALINA
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT SCARED MANY RESIDENTS of the transboundary
region of  Latvia  and  Lithuania.  Panic broke out especially
among citizens  in  the  Latvian  city  of   Daugavpils.   The
breakdown in  one  of  the  plant's regulators sent a cloud of
steam high into the air at 7:40 in the  morning  as  residents
were awakening.  When they saw the large mushroom cloud on the
horizon, many  stayed  in  their  homes  and  farmers  quickly
brought their   cattle  in  from  pasture.  Local  authorities
received a wave  of  phone  calls  from  people  seeking  more
information.
______________________________________________________________
RUSSIA

ST. PETERSBURG-MUNICH  -- THE RUSSIAN MINATOM AND THE BAVARIAN
STATE  DIVISION  FOR  ENVIRONMENTAL  PROTECTION   have   begun
construction of a new type of reactor  -  VVER-640  -  at  the
Sosnovy Bor   Nuclear   Power   Plant.  The  firm  Siemens  is
responsible for the work on  the  German  side.  Much  of  the
actual construction  work  on the reactor will be conducted at
the Izhorskii,  Metallicheskii,  and Electrosile Factories  in
St. Petersburg, and will be overseen by Siemens. Completion is
planned for 2003.  Minatom will pay for  the  construction  in
large part  with the production from the new block in the form
of uranium.
     
KALINIGRAD/KOENIGSBERG, sept.   1,   -   The   baltic   marine
prosecution investigate the case of nuclear  shipping  in  the
Baltic Sea.  On July 30,  the ship with uranium arrived to the
waters near the Kaliningrad' seaport which  was  transit  port
for the   ship.  The  x-USSR  antinuclear  campaign  organized
protests to prevent such  transit.  The  protests  forced  the
authorities to  give  no  permission for the ship to enter the
seaport. The protests costed about  US$  million  for  nuclear
industry. Now,  the  case of transit is under investigation of
the prosecution. The seaport may be closed for nuclear transit
forever in case if the prosecution' investigation will confirm
that nuclear transit is a the violation over russian laws.

ATTENTION!
Th ex-USSR antinuclear campaign is organizing the party  "Here
is no   nuke  ships!"  by  the  late-september  at  disco-club
"Megadance-Atlantika", Kaliningrad/Koenigsberg.    All     the
interested parties   ask  for  more  information  through  the
campaign' contact below. Visit and Enjoy!

ROSTOV NUCLEAR POWER PLANT,  Sept. 6, - The start up of Rostov
nuclear power plant,  central Russia, is proposed by 1997. The
protests of  local  citizens and environmentalists resulted in
three rallies in the  closest  to  the  NPP  cities,  and  the
blockade of  the road following to the NPP' construction side.
During the august and september,  The police attacked the camp
of environmentalists  near  the  NPP and another camp into the
city. Some activists were injured but not arrested. Later more
than 10  activists  were  arrested  and jailed for a day.  The
rally by local citizens expressed the wish to replace the head
of local  authority  who  supported  the  NPP'  start up.  The
new election of  the  local  authority's  head  is  coming  in
October. Over  20  international  faxes,  protesting  the NPP'
start up,  is received by regional authorities for  the  third
week that   x-USSR   antinuclear   campaign   organizing   the
international fax-pressure.

Russland am Scheideweg: Menschenrechte, politische Entwicklung
und Rolle von NGOs

Tagung vom 4. bis 6. Oktober 1996  in Berlin veranstaltet von
der Evangelischen Akademie Berlin-Brandenburg, vom
Deutsch-Russischer Austausch e.V. und der
Heinrich-Boell-Stiftung e.V.

Wohin steuert Russland? Wird es einen Weg zu Rechtstaatlichkeit
und Demokratie finden und sich in eine europaeische
Zusammenarbeit einbinden lassen? Hat vor diesem Hintergrund die
europaeische Friedensordnung, wie sie in der Pariser Charta fuer
Europa entworfen wurde, noch eine realistische Chance?
Angesichts der unsicheren Lage und der Unwaegbarkeiten ueber den
weiteren Kurs der russischen Politik gewinnt die Unterstuetzung
demokratischer NGOs und ihre Einbindung in gesamteuropaeische
Strukturen der Kooperation zentrale Bedeutung. Die Tagung soll
dem Austausch mit russischen Gruppen dienen, die einem
demokratischen Selbstverstaendnis verpflichtet sind. Sie soll
die Bedeutung russischer NGOs als politische Partner des Westens
in das Bewusstsein der Oeffentlichkeit ruecken und im Gespraech
mit Politikern und Vertretern russischer
Menschenrechtsorganisationen die deutsche Russland-Politik
kritisch unter die Lupe nehmen. Programm:  Freitag, 4. Oktober

OECD/IAEA's new Red Book is out: URANIUM 1995: Resources,
Production and Demand, Paris 1996, 362 p. ISBN 92-64-14875-2.
The book is published every other year and contains statistical
data on uranium ore deposits and their exploration, uranium
production, and reactor related uranium requirements from 23 of
the 25 uranium producing countries of the world. The most
remarkable change, compared to earlier editions of the book, is
the inclusion of a paragraph on the environmental aspects of
uranium production. But, the result of this new effort is rather
disappointing: Only a few countries give an overview of the
environmental impacts of the existing and former uranium mining
operations.

Miroslav Kundrata, et al, Interaction Between Agriculture and
Nature Conservation in the Czech and Slovak Republics (1995) is
a 123-page report, Volume 8 in the IUCN European Programme
Environmental Research Series. Its four principal sections
provide an overview of Czech and Slovak agriculture, an analysis
of the impact of present development on the environment, a
review of institutions and policies, and options for the
protection and management of areas of high natural value. For

IUCN, The Mountains of Central and Eastern Europe (1995) is the
third in a series of reviews of the conservation of natural
habitats in Central and Eastern Europe, having been preceded by
IUCN reviews of grasslands (1991) and wetlands (1993). This
139-page report is organized in four major sections: seven major
mountain ranges, issues affecting conservation of biological and
landscape diversity in fourteen countries, overview of issues
(agriculture, forestry, air pollution, water pollution and dams,
recreation and tourism, hunting and fishing, construction of
infrastructure and mining, military activities, and land
redistribution) and proposals for further action. For further
information, contact IUCN at the addresses indicated in the
preceding paragraph.

IUCN, Best Practice for Conservation Planning in Rural Areas
(1995) is a 74-page volume offering 10 major guidelines for best
practices, each accompanied by lengthy lists of suggested
actions. The report draws on seven case studies from Central and
Eastern Europe, including such locations as the Danube Delta and
The Green Lungs of Poland. It addresses project processes,
institutions, sectoral policy links, building the knowledge
base, legislation, regulation, funding, and other issues.
Contact: IUCN at the addresses indicated two paragraphs above.

IUCN, River Corridors in Hungary: A Strategy for the
Conservation of the Danube and its Tributaries (1993-94) (1995)
is a 124-page volume in Hungarian and English coordinated by
Odon Radai. The first half of the volume describes the strategy,
discussing such issues as policies, research, and priorities for
river corridors; restoration of riverine ecosystems; public
awareness and involvement; and conflict solving and management
tools for achieving wise and sustainable use of river corridors.

Graham Bennett (ed.) Conserving Europe's Natural Heritage:
Towards a European Ecological Network is the 300+ page
proceedings of an international conference convened in
Maastricht in November 1993. The conferences was organized by
the Netherlands and Hungarian governments in collaboration with
NGOs. The principal focus of the volume is EECONET, the European
Ecological Network. EECONET is intended as a vehicle for
creating an international cooperative framework for maintaining
and enhancing natural and semi-natural systems in Europe. The
volume addresses the role of various governmental and
nongovernmental institutions, international agreements, the role
of nationally protected areas and their managers, and such
specific biomes as forests, grasslands, and wetlands. Publisher:

For several years, the Global Environment Facility, through the
World Bank, has been funding biodiversity protection projects in
Central and Eastern Europe. These are described in various
project documents. "Czech Republic: Biodiversity Protection"
(1994) is the 70+ page document describing the Czech Project,
which protects ecosystem biodiversity in three representative
ecosystems (alpine meadows, lowland forests, and wetlands). The
project supports three transnational biodiversity protection
networks, introduces user fees and related charges for visitors
and concessions, and includes a small grant program for NGOs.
Similar project documents exist for the Slovak Republic
Biodiversity Protection Project (June 1994) and the Romania
Danube Delta Biodiversity Project (August 1994). Progress on
these and other Global Environment Facility projects around the
world is reported quarterly in "Facing the Global Environment
Challenge: A Progress Report on World Bank Global Environment
Operations." These documents, this quarterly report, and project
documents for other Central Europe biodiversity protection
projects, are available from Environment Department

Sofia Conference Documents: In 1991, at the Dobris ministerial
conference, "Environment for Europe", European ministers called
for a comprehensive assessment of Europe's environment and
envisaged development of an Environmental Programme for Europe.
At the 1993 Lucerne ministerial conference, European ministers
endorsed the elements of an Environm. Programme for Europe and,
more particularly, an Environm. Action Programme for Central and
Eastern Europe. In October 1995, the third in the series of
Environment for Europe Ministerial Conferences was convened in
Sofia, Bulgaria. A useful overview for the general public of the
steps leading up to the Sofia conference, containing elements of
the conference documents, is found in the 41-page publication,
"Environment for Europe", published in 1995 by the U.N. Economic
Commission for Europe (UNECE). Info: Environment and Human
Settlements Division, UNECE, Palais des Nations, CH-1211 Geneva
10, Switzerland. Phone (41 22) 917 1234. Fax (41 22) 917 0123.
An extensive listing of Sofia conference documents has also been
published by the UNECE. This is UNECE document ECE/CEP/27, "List
of Documents for the Sofia Conference." The major future actions
adopted at the conference are reflected in "Environmental
Programme for Europe" (ECE Documents ECE/CEP/25 and
ECE/CEP/25/Corr.2--29 pages). Selected additional documents
include: "Business, Industry and the Environment" (ECE Document
SOF.CONF/BD.5--38 pages) and "Integration of Environmental and
Sectoral Policies" (ECE Document SOF.CONF/BD.2--16 pages).
Europe's Environment--The Dobris Assessment (1995) is the
principal factual underpinning of the Sofia conference. 600
pages long, with text, maps, diagrams, tables, and other graphic
aids, its 40 chapters address the state of the environment in 46
European countries, including the human pressures producing
these conditions. Info: European Environment Agency, Kongens

The U.S.AID-funded Environmental Training Project (ETP) for
Central and Eastern Europe has trained thousands of individuals
in six Central and Eastern European countries in environmental
planning, financing, decisionmaking, and training and
facilitation. Coordinated by the University of Minnesota, in
cooperation with WWF and other partners in the U.S. and
overseas, the project has worked with NGOs, environmental
businesses, restructuring heavy industries, local and regional
governments, and universities. Most of the publications are in
English and Polish, reflecting the cooperative "Post-Diploma
Studies" extension program conducted cooperatively by Silesia
Technical University and ETP. Other include works on designing
public inventories of chemical releases in the Czech Republic,

Seit 1995 wird im Rahmen des von der Buntstift e.V. gefoerderten
Projekts einmal jaehrlich ein Fortbildungsseminar fuer
MitarbeiterInnen der lettischen Projektgruppe organisiert. Diese
Seminare werden SO organisiert, dass auch Mitglieder anderer
NGOs in Lettland teilnehmen koennen, also der
Erfahrungsaustausch untereinander gefoerdert wird. Auch der

noch engagierte Moorschuetzer/innen zu finden. Momentan werden
umfangreiche Kartierungsarbeiten der estnischen Moore von der
Torfindustrie finanziert. Das ging SO weit, dass ein estnisches
Mitglied der Internationalen Moorsachutzvereinigung Anfragen zu
seiner Einschaetzung der Situation der Moore in Estland nicht

SO einfach das liest war die Umsetzung des Projekts allerdings
nicht. Der Antrag, die Abwicklung und die Abrechnung gegenueber
dem Umweltministerium ist muehsam und aeusserst zeitaufwendig.

Alexej Soldatow (Moskau) ueber Informationsbeschaffung im
Bereich staatlicher Umweltvorschriften in Russland: 

Die russische Umweltgesetzgebung ist noch sehr jung. SO
verwundert es kaum, dass das russische Umweltrecht noch auf
recht wackligen Fuessen steht. Dabei ist es nicht nur ein

Angesichts der Beschwernisse auf den traditionellen Wegen der
Post- und Verkehrsverbindungen scheint diese Form der
Informationsuebermittlung zunehmend an Bedeutung zu gewinnen.
Ein noch groesseres Problem ist die Informationsbeschaffung. SO
kommt es nicht selten vor, dass eine Behoerde Informationen, zu
deren Herausgabe sie verpflichtet waere, nicht herauszugeben
- - - -
bereit ist. Die zustaendigen Beamten versuchen vielmehr, diese
Informationen auf eigene Rechnung zu verkaufen, was natuerlich
viel lukrativer ist. SO hatte mir beispielsweise einmal eine
Vertreterin des russischen Bundesgesundheitsamtes allen Ernstes
gesagt, dass das Bundesgesundheitsamt ein Copyright auf die von
- - - -
ihm erlassenen Grenzwertbestimmungen besitze. Auch vom
Umweltministerium lassen sich nicht SO ohne weiteres
Informationen bekommen. Bei meiner Arbeit an der Umweltdatenbank
"Kleeblatt" war mir immer wieder klar geworden, dass es fuer das

erreichen, nicht beruecksichtigt. Die Grenzwerte sind in
Russland haeufig sogar strenger als die der EU-Laender. Doch es
ist nicht schwer fuer russische Firmen, diese
Grenzwertkontrollen zu umgehen. SO z.B. werden immer wieder
nachts Abgase und Abwaesser abgegeben. Wenn dann am naechsten
Morgen eine Kontrolle stattfindet, laesst sich haeufig die
- - - -
1991 finanzierten Tschernobyl-Forschungsprojekte vorgestellt.
Insgesamt standen fuer das EG-Programm 23 Mio. ECU zur
Verfuegung, von denen etwa 40 Prozent direkt in den drei
betroffenen Republiken verwendet wurden, SO dass hier durch das
Programm tatsaechlich eine spuerbare Verbesserung der

gesellschaftlichen humanitaeren Tschernobyl-Hilfe oder ueber

ueber die Konsequenzen der neuen Beziehungen zu Russland fuer
die belarussische Souveraenitaet waren jedoch auch die
Grundsaetze der staatlichen Tschernobyl-Politik Gegenstand
kontroverser Debatten am 10. Jahrestag der Katastrophe. SO hatte
das Ministerkabinett Anfang 1996 beschlossen, offiziell kein
neues umfassendes Tschernobyl-Staatsprogramm zu verabschieden,

einzige "Geheime", auf das er in dem Fall gestossen sei, der
leidenschaftliche Wunsch der Militaers, die katastrophale

Seitdem suchte die Leitung des slowakischen Energiesektors
westliche Anleger, die sich an der Fertigstellung des AKW
beteiligen koennten. Die Meinung von allen slowakischen
Regierungen ist bis heute SO geblieben, JEMO in jedem Fall
fertigzustellen. Die Bemuehungen fuehrten zur Kooperation von SE
mit Electricite de France, Bayernwerk und Preussen Elektra. Im

Eines der wichtigsten Elemente der Kampagne war die Verwendung
von oeffentlichen Beteiligungsmechanismen und der Druck auf die
EBRD. SO mussten die westlichen Investoren einige klare
Bedingungen ihrer Beteiligung im JEMO-Projekt aufstellen - z.B.
international akzeptable Sicherheitsstandards, die Ausarbeitung

unzulaengliche Sicherheit der Originalkonstruktion (z.B.
fehlendes Reaktorcontainment, unzulaenglicher Brandschutz,
internen Ueberflutungen, Absturz externer Objekte usw.) nicht

Sicherheitsstandards zu entsprechen. Dies alles konnte
unvorhergesehene Sicherheitsprobleme verursachen. Die Probleme

und Rohrleitungen", SO die FR, "wollen die Ingenieure die Gefahr

darin eine grosse Gefahr: 'Dass derartige Einzelmassnahmen ein

Sehr geehrter Herr Dr. Holzer, die Bayernwerke markierten mitten
in der allgemeinen oekonomischen Betruebnis ihren 75. Geburtstag
durch ein 'Fest der Superlative'. 1.200 Persoenlichkeiten aus
Wirtschaft und Politik, SO las man, waren geladen; 750 Helfer
dekorierten die Olympiahalle, nichts wurde versaeumt, um das
Datum jubelnd zu feiern. Ich habe 74 von den gefeierten 75

einzudringen - der muss Ihnen und Ihresgleichen vorbehalten
bleiben. Fuer uns, die Alternativen, stellt sich das Problem
grundsaetzlich gegenteilig. Fuer uns sind etwa Atomkraftwerke
Ueberkapazitaeten, die nach Tschernobyl nicht nur SO
ueberfluessig, sondern so gefaehrlich wie ein Gehirntumor sind.
Fuer uns fuehrt der Weg in die Zukunft nur ueber regenerative

Gleichzeitig riefen die Staaten in einer gemeinsamen Erklaerung
zu einem Waffenstillstand im Nahen Osten auf. Zu der Forderung
nach einem Atomteststopp sagte US-Praesident Bill Clinton:
"Durch die Fortschritte hier in Moskau sind wir diesem Ziel SO
nah wie nie seit Beginn des Atomzeitalters." Clinton zeigte sich
zuversichtlich, dass der Vertrag im September bei den Vereinten

Europaeischen Kommission und der Internationalen
AtomenergieAgentur in Wien veranstaltet. Der Tenor war einhellig
SO: Man musste zugestehen, dass es nach 1986 haeufiger
Schilddruesenkrebs gibt - der sei ja aber operabel, also nicht
weiter schlimm. Es gaebe aber keine Zunahme von Leukaemie.

Parlamente. Im Nationalen Report Belorussland vom Januar `96
kann man etwa finden, dass Leukaemie bei Kindern, die in
belasteten Gebieten leben, signifikant angestiegen ist und dass
die Leukaemie bei Liquidatoren doppelt SO hoch ist wie bei
gleichaltrigen Buergern Belorusslands. Es wurde also gebogen und
gelogen, um das geschaeftsschaedigende Thema Tschernobyl

Tschernobyl veraendert hat. Sie wissen, dass sie belogen wurden
und werden. Sie merken, wenn sie erkranken und haben weder Zeit
noch Mittel, um eine eigene Statistik aufzustellen. Die Menschen
sind SO gepruegelt durch das zusammengebrochene sowjetische
System, dass die Probleme von Tschernobyl einfach in die dritte
Reihe geschoben werden. Die Grossbetriebe gehenkaputt,

Dorothea Boegelsack (Gruene Liga) berichtet ueber den Stand der
Bemuehungen, ein Koordinationsbuero Osteuropa der deutschen
Umweltverbaende in Berlin zu eroeffnen. Ziel ist die Einrichtung
von zwei Stellen. Seine Aufgabe soll sein, 

Anlauflaufstelle fuer mittel- und osteuropaeische Initiativen zu
werden, 

Reibungsverluste bei der Ost-Ost-Koordination aufzufangen,

Osteuropa in Politik und Oeffentlichkeit staerker ins
Bewusstsein zu ruecken und

die Umwelt- und Naturschutzverbaende gegenueber dem BMU zu
staerken.

Ueber die Notwendigkeit des Projektes besteht Konsens. Es wird
vorgeschlagen, das Buero moege einen eigenen Newsletter ueber
Projektausschreibungen und -erfahrungen herauszugeben.

2.	Kooperation zwischen InfoBalt und dem lettischen
Umweltverband VAK:

Albert Caspari berichtet ueber seine Erfahrungen beim Aufbau
einer lettisch-deutschen Staette fuer Umwelterziehung und ueber
den 10. internationale Torfkongress in Bremen. In der Diskussion
zeigt sich Kritik an fehlenden Strategien und mangelnder
Kooperation zwischen den GRUeNEN-nahen Stiftungen Heinrich
Boell-Stiftung und Buntstift.

Projekt "Buergerzentrum fuer Umwelt, Kultur und Politik Riga"

Das Projekt ist eine Kooperation zwischen der Gruenen-nahen
Stiftung Buntstift e.V. und dem lettischen Umweltverband "Vides
Aizsardzibas Klubs" (VAK). Es soll die "gruene Bewegung"
Lettlands in ihren Moeglichkeiten zu kreativen Aktivitaeten,
Oeffentlichkeitsarbeit fuer Umwelt- und Naturschutz und der
Weiterentwicklung selbstorganisierter Projekte staerken und
unterstuetzen.  Projektpartner ist die Gruppe Arkadija des VAK,
die im Park Arkadija im Rigaer Stadtteil Tornkalns ein Umweltund
Kulturzentrum aufbaut.  Der vor 100 Jahren angelegte Park wurde
anlaesslich  einiger zentraler Aktionen der lettischen
Umweltbewegung Ende der 80er Jahre aufgrund von
Demonstrationsverboten in der Innenstadt zum haeufig genutzten
Versammlungsort. Daneben traf sich im Park schon seit Jahren
eine Kunst- und Kulturgruppe. Das Projekt Arkadija moechte diese
Traditionen der Verbindung von oekologischem Gedanken und
kreativer Betaetigung auch fuer die Zukunft erhalten. Groesste
Schwierigkeit dabei: Ein Veranstaltungshaus, ganz aus Holz im
Jugendstil gebaut, muss dringend renoviert werden. Die Stadt
Riga, in deren Besitz sich Haus und Park noch befinden, hat
wenig Mittel dafuer. Neue Ideen werden gesucht. Adresse des
Projektbueros: VAK ARKADIJA, Ingrida Indane, O.Vaciesa iela 2,
Lv-1004 Riga; Tel. 00371-2-612081, Fax 00371-7227570.
Projektbeginn war am 1.1.1993. Ab 1996 ist das Projekt um vier
weitere Jahre verlaengert worden.

Einige der bisherigen Aktivitaeten der Projektgruppe Arkadija in
Riga und anderen Staedten Lettlands: Seminare "Alternative
Landwirtschaft", "Oekologischer Zustand des Sees Babite",
"Energieversorgung in Lettland", "Naturschutz und
Fischwirtschaft in den Seen Lettlands", "Bauer und Wald Zukunft
der Waldwirtschaft", "Windenergie", "Landschaftsarchitektur und
Umweltschutz", "Auswirkungen radioaktiver Niedrigstrahlung auf
den Menschen", "Umweltfreundlicher Tourismus in Lettland",
"Probleme der Restaurierung von Holzhaeusern", "Analyse von
Konfliktsituationen", "Umweltqualitaetsmessung durch
Bioindikatoren", "Warenzeichen fuer umweltfreundliche Produkte";
Veranstaltungsreihe zum "Tag der Erde", "Gruene Bruecke",
Internationale Sommerakademien in 1995 und 1996.
Veroeffentlichungen (in lettischer Sprache, mit englischen
Abstracts): Zeitung Eko-Logs (Umweltfenster) (1993-96 in
insgesamt 26 Ausgaben). Broschueren "Metalle und unser
Organismus", "Asbest", "Auch tote Baeume bedeuten Leben", "100
Jahre Park Arkadija", Uebersetzung des Buches "Oekologisches
Bauen" (Krusche/Althauss).

Seit 1995 wird im Rahmen des von der Buntstift e.V. gefoerderten
Projekts einmal jaehrlich ein Fortbildungsseminar fuer
MitarbeiterInnen der lettischen Projektgruppe organisiert. Diese
Seminare werden <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> organisiert, dass auch Mitglieder anderer
NGOs in Lettland teilnehmen koennen, also der
Erfahrungsaustausch untereinander gefoerdert wird. Auch der
Austausch mit Gruppen aus Deutschland wird angestrebt, jedoch
fehlt momentan fuer einen dauerhaften internationalen Austausch
noch das Geld. Aber: Es soll jeweils einigen Interessent/innen
aus Deutschland die Teilnahme ermoeglicht werden, wenn sie die
Reisekosten selbst tragen koennen.  Das naechste Seminar findet
voraussichtlich vom 30.Oktober bis 3.November 1996 statt.

10th International Peat Congress/Torfkongress in Bremen:

Vom 27.Mai bis 2. Juni 1996 fand in Bremen  der 10.
internationale Torfkongress statt. "Torfabbau ist oftmals
unbedenklich" titelte der Bremer Weser-Kurier am 29.Mai die
Veranstaltung, die von der International Peat Society (IPS)
veranstaltet wurde. Zitiert wurden dort wie auch in den
Presseerklaerungen der Organisatoren selbst Aussagen wie "es
werden in Schweden zum Beispiel vier bis fuenf Millionen
Kubikmeter Torf abgebaut, waehrend 20 Millionen Kubikmeter
nachwachsen" und "60% der europaeischen und 92% der Moore
weltweit sind in tadellosem Zustand." Anlaesslich des Kongresses
waren auch zwei lettische WissenschaftlerInnen nach Bremen
gekommen. Ausserdem war von niedersaechsischen Torffirmen
bekannt geworden, dass sie damit drohen, ins Baltikum
abzuwandern, falls ihnen nicht bessere Abbaumoeglichkeiten
eingeraeumt wuerden. Auf der Konferenz selbst gab es keine
Fachdiskussionen, die Beitraege waren lange vorher schriftlich
eingereicht worden und wurden nur zusammenfassend vorgetragen.
Die Veranstaltungsorte (Hotel Marriot und World Trade Center)
trugen dazu bei, dass die Oeffentlichkeit ausser dem kleinen
Zeitungsartikel recht wenig mitbekam. Der Kongress hatte den
Charakter einer Kontaktboerse, auf der die Torfindustrie neue
Partner/innen suchte, womit sie, was das Baltikum angeht, schon
recht weit ist. Waehrend in Litauen wegen relativ geringer
Moorflaechen das Thema nicht diskutiert wird, die
TeilnehmerInnen aus Lettland sich wenigstens noch Sorgen wegen
der moeglicherweise bevorstehenden grossflaechigen Ausweitung
des Abbaus machten, scheint es in Estland besonders schwierig,
noch engagierte Moorschuetzer/innen zu finden. Momentan werden
umfangreiche Kartierungsarbeiten der estnischen Moore von der
Torfindustrie finanziert. Das ging <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a> weit, dass ein estnisches
Mitglied der Internationalen Moorsachutzvereinigung Anfragen zu
seiner Einschaetzung der Situation der Moore in Estland nicht
mehr selbst beantwortete, sondern zunaechst der Torfindustrie
weiterleitete. Ausserdem wird Torf in den baltischen Staaten
teilweise als umweltvertraegliche Ressource fuer die
Energieerzeugung bezeichnet, da sie ja regional gewonnen und
eingesetzt werden kann.  Es ist also angebracht, die weiteren
Aktivitaeten zum Thema Torfabbau im Baltikum genau zu beobachten
(siehe auch Artikel von Valentin Thurn in Natur + Umwelt, Heft
2/96).  Weitere Ansprechpersonen: Arno Schoppenhorst, Oekologis,
Brahmsstrasse 2, 28209 Bremen; Tel. 0421-3477860. Er betreute
vor zwei Jahren ein Projekt zwischen BUND Bremen, der Stiftung
Europaeisches Naturerbe und dem lettischen Naturschutzfond zur
Einrichtung eines zweiten Nationalparks in Lettland. Das
Kemeri-Gebiet ist vor allem wegen seiner Moorflaechen
erhaltenswert.  In Lettland: Mara Pakalne, Universitaet

3.	Oekologisches Kulturzentrum in Kiew: (vgl. auch Beilage
Rundbrief Nr. 11)

Erdmuthe Arnold kann den erfolgreichen Aufbau eines
Oekologischen Kulturzentrums fuer Kinder in Kiew "Dytyna i
Dovkillja" mit einem Finanzvolumen von 26.000 DM vermelden. 50
Prozent der Mittel stammen aus einem Etatposten des Hessischen
Umweltministeriums, die nach der Ueberwindung einiger
buerokratischer Huerden bewilligt wurden. Ein umfangreicher
Briefwechsel kann bei Bedarf als Muster fuer aehnliche Antraege
und Projekte eingesehen werden. Fuer die laufenden Kosten
(Miete, Loehne, etc.) werden weiterhin Spenden gesucht.

Ein Lehrstueck der Projektfoerderung: Die Ersteinrichtung des
oekologischen Kulturzentrums fuer Kinder 

Namens der NGO Dytyna i Dovkillja (Kind und Umwelt) hatte ich
mich erstmals am 1. Juni 1994 an das Hessische Ministerium fuer
Umwelt, Energie und Bundesangelegenheiten gewandt und als
Sprecherin des Arbeitskreises Osteuropa des BUND Hessen um die
finanzielle Unterstuetzung der Ersteinrichtung eines
oekologischen Kulturzentrums fuer Kinder in Kiew gebeten.
Letztendlich mit Erfolg: Das Ministerium hat die Haelfte der
insgesamt benoetigten 25.624 DM beigesteuert. Das Geld konnte
ich der Frauengruppe Anfang September 1995 in Kiew uebergeben.
Zum 1. November 1995 konnte Dytyna i Dovkillja eine 42
Quadratmeter grosse, zentralgelegene Wohnung in der Strasse
Saksaganskogo 77, Kiew 34, in der Naehe einer der Schulen
anmieten, in denen die Frauen Umwelterziehungsunterricht geben.
<a name=L10003></a><a href=#L10004>So</a> einfach das liest war die Umsetzung des Projekts allerdings
nicht. Der Antrag, die Abwicklung und die Abrechnung gegenueber
dem Umweltministerium ist muehsam und aeusserst zeitaufwendig. 
Unsere gemeinsam erstellte Liste der benoetigten Gegenstaende
fuer die Ersteinrichtung genuegten den Massstaeben des
Ministeriums nicht - obwohl alle Gegenstaende samt Preisen
ausgewiesen waren. Computer, Drucker etc. mussten genau benannt,
der Finanzierungsplan (also die Betraege haelftig auf den BUND
und auf das Ministerium verteilt) ausgewiesen werden. Im dritten
Anlauf war es jedenfalls geschafft. Es setzte dann eine sehr
lange Wartezeit ein, da im Ministerium ein Haushaltsstop alle
Foerdermassnahmen auf Eis legte. Geduld war deshalb ausgiebigst
zu praktizieren. Ich glaube, zeitweise glaubten die Frauen in
Kiew gar nicht mehr an die Durchfuehrbarkeit, doch wiederholte
Anrufe im Ministerium machten es mir moeglich, immer wieder zu
signalisieren: "Es wird schon klappen!" Naechste Huerde war der
Verwendungsnachweis. Alle Rechnungen beziehungsweise
Schriftstuecke mussten von einem ermaechtigten Uebersetzer ins
Deutsche uebersetzt werden (das hatte dankenswerter Weise
Bernhard Clasen uebernommen). Dem Kostenvoranschlag stellte ich
nunmehr die tatsaechlichen Kosten Punkt fuer Punkt gegenueber
und meinte, damit dem Behoerdenformular "Einfacher
Verwendungsnachweis" bzw. "Verwendungsnachweis" ausreichend
entsprochen zu haben. Die Quittung bekam ich im Juli 1996 - also
war ich wieder zwei Tage buchhalterisch taetig und fieselte alle
Einnahmen und Ausgaben ab meinem Bankkonto nach Datum auf. Fuer
mich war es regelrecht ein Wunder, dass am Ende tatsaechlich
identische Betraege auf der Einnahmen- und Ausgabenseite
herauskamen.

Fazit: Mich persoenlich hat die Betreuung des Projekts sehr viel
Zeit und auch Geld gekostet, zumal nur die Ersteinrichtung des
Kulturzentrums gefoerdert wurde und ich um Spenden seitens der
BUND bemueht sein musste. Weder die zwei Reisen nach Kiew
(einmal zur Bestandsaufnahme dessen, was benoetigt wurde, und
dann zur Einleitung der Einkaeufe), noch die Miete fuer die
notwendigen Raeumlichkeiten konnten finanziell gefoerdert
werden. Dennoch - ich weiss, es ist gut angelegtes Geld - die
Umwelterziehung laeuft erfolgreich. Darueber hinaus ergaben sich
durch dieses Engagement neue Freundschaften in einem Land und
einer Stadt, die fuenf Jahre vorher jenseits meines Horizonts
lagen. Was mir besonders deutlich wurde, solche Projekte koennen
ehrenamtlich kaum durchgezogen werden. Hier bedarf es unbedingt
einer Anlaufstelle, die dies hauptamtlich betreibt.

Natalia Oulianets, Sprecherin von Dytyna i Dovkillja, schreibt
in ihrem juengsten Brief vom 4. Juni 1996

sinngemaess: Alles in und an unserem neuen Buero beziehungsweise
Kulturzentrum ist hoechst erfreulich. Unsere Besucher sprechen
sehr anerkennend ueber unsere Umwelterziehungsarbeit mit den
Kindern. Wir haben gerade ein grosses Erziehungsprogramm fuer
Kindergaerten erarbeitet und dieses mit der Bitte um finanzielle
Unterstuetzung in Bruessel eingereicht. Von dort wurde uns
signalisiert, dass das Projekt eventuell Beruecksichtigung
finden wird. Dieser Tage hatten wir eine Ecomissia-Konferenz
durchgefuehrt. Dabei fiel der Beschluss, dieses Netzwerk von
Umweltgruppen als Nichtregierungsorganisation legalisieren zu
lassen. Vielen wurde bewusst, dass es notwendig ist, alle
Kraefte zu sammeln, um effektive Umweltarbeit zu leisten. Einer
der drei gewaehlten Vorsitzenden ist Andrej Glazovoj. Unsere
Organisation Dytyna i Dovkillja hat waehrend der Konferenz mit
einer Arbeitsgruppe Umwelterziehung einen aktiven Part
uebernommen. Wir einigten uns darin auf das gemeinsame Ziel, ein
Seminar fuer Umwelterziehung in der Ukraine zu realisieren.

4.	GTZ-Projekt zur Foerderung von Umweltverbaenden in Moldova
unD TACIS-Projekt des Palais Jalta zum Verwaltungsaufbau in
St.Petersburg:

Udo Heitmann stellt seine Arbeit im Rahmen eines Projekts der
Gesellschaft fuer Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) zur Foerderung
von Umweltverbaenden in Moldavien vor. (vgl.S.13) Die
Beschreibung des standardisierten Verfahrens der
"Zielorientierten Projektplanung (ZOPP)" loest eine kontroverse
Diskussion ueber den Sinn derartiger, aus der Consulting-Branche
entlehnter Methoden, das Verhaeltnis von Input und Output, die
Nachhaltigkeit der GTZ-Arbeit, die Kontrollierbarkeit der
Mittelverwendung und den Zuschnitt internationaler
umweltorientierter Projektarbeit aus. Matthias Vetters Bericht
ueber ein Beratungsprojekt von TACIS (das EU-Programm Technical
Assistance To The Commonwealth of Independent States), fuer das
das Frankfurter "Palais Jalta" den Zuschlag zur Durchfuehrung
bekommen hatte und mit einem Volumen von ca. 1,5 Mio. ECU (fast
3 Mio. DM) sich mit Strukturreformen der St. Petersburger
Stadtverwaltung beschaeftigte, erweitert die Dimension der
Diskussion auf den offiziellen europaeischen Bereich. Es
herrscht Diskussions- und Aufklaerungsbedarf ueber die Chancen
und Grenzen, das Pro und Contra derartiger staatlicher und
suprastaatlicher Projektfinanzierung. Der Zuschnitt, die
Vergabekriterien, der Erfolg und der Umfang des Kapital- und
Knowhow-Transfers sowie der Nutzen derartiger EU-Programme wie
TACIS und PHARE (das EU-Programm zugunsten der
ostmitteleuropaeischen Staaten) bleiben umstritten. Hier ist
mehr Transparenz erforderlich. Dem Vernehmen nach werden direkte
Umweltprojekte kaum mehr aus diesen Programmen finanziert,
sondern nur noch solche, die einen direkten Bezug zu
Menschenrechtsfragen und Demokratie haben. Hier sollte eine
systematische Bestandsaufnahme in Form eines Seminars oder einer
groesseren Veroeffentlichung, an denen Teilnehmerinnen und
Teilnehmer aus Politik, Wirtschaft, Verwaltung, Umweltverbaenden
und aus den Empfaengerlaendern mitwirken sollten. Es bleibt
offen, wer als Veranstalter wirken koennte: Eine Kooperation
zwischen dem Arbeitskreis Osteuropa des BUND und einer der
politischen Stiftungen oder dem "Forschungsschwerpunkt
Konfliktund Kooperationsstrukturen in Osteuropa" an der
Universitaet Mannheim boete sich an.

5.	Umweltgesetzgebung in Russland

Alexej Soldatow (Moskau) ueber Informationsbeschaffung im
Bereich staatlicher Umweltvorschriften in Russland: 

Die russische Umweltgesetzgebung ist noch sehr jung. <a name=L10004></a><a href=#L10005>So</a>
verwundert es kaum, dass das russische Umweltrecht noch auf
recht wackligen Fuessen steht. Dabei ist es nicht nur ein
Problem, dass sich Umweltnormen schwer umsetzen lassen. Haeufig
ist es fuer eine interessierte Oeffentlichkeit ueberhaupt ein
Problem, an umweltrelevante Informationen und Vorschriften
heranzukommen. Zwar werden viele Vorschriften, Erlasse etc. zum
Thema Oekologie von der Russischen Bundesagentur fuer die
oekologischen Informationen im Umweltministerium (REFIA)
veroeffentlicht. Ausserdem werden viele wichtige Dokumente auch
in der Presse veroeffentlicht. Trotzdem gibt es ein sehr grosses
Informationsbeduerfnis, das dadurch nicht befriedigt werden
kann. Vor diesem Hintergrund spielen private kommerzielle
Informationsagenturen, die ihre Dienstleistungen als
regelmaessig aktualisierte Datenbanken anbieten, eine immer
wichtigere Rolle. Diese wetteifern nun in einem regelrechten
Konkurrenzkampf miteinander. Allein in Moskau gibt es mehr als
zehn grosse Anbieter fuer Datenbanken der Rechtssprechung. Zur
Vermittlung der oeffentlichen Informationen ueber die
staatlichen Umweltvorschiften gewinnen die elektronischen Medien
zunehmend an Bedeutung. REFIA kann ueber ein
TV-EkoInform-Programm Menschen in fast allen Regionen Russlands
erreichen. Momentan verfuegen in Russland noch sehr wenige
Organisationen und Personen ueber einen Internet-Zugang.
Angesichts der Beschwernisse auf den traditionellen Wegen der
Post- und Verkehrsverbindungen scheint diese Form der
Informationsuebermittlung zunehmend an Bedeutung zu gewinnen.
Ein noch groesseres Problem ist die Informationsbeschaffung. <a name=L10005></a><a href=#L10006>So</a>
kommt es nicht selten vor, dass eine Behoerde Informationen, zu
deren Herausgabe sie verpflichtet waere, nicht herauszugeben
bereit ist. Die zustaendigen Beamten versuchen vielmehr, diese
Informationen auf eigene Rechnung zu verkaufen, was natuerlich
viel lukrativer ist. <a name=L10006></a><a href=#L10007>So</a> hatte mir beispielsweise einmal eine
Vertreterin des russischen Bundesgesundheitsamtes allen Ernstes
gesagt, dass das Bundesgesundheitsamt ein Copyright auf die von
ihm erlassenen Grenzwertbestimmungen besitze. Auch vom
Umweltministerium lassen sich nicht <a name=L10007></a><a href=#L10008>so</a> ohne weiteres
Informationen bekommen. Bei meiner Arbeit an der Umweltdatenbank
"Kleeblatt" war mir immer wieder klar geworden, dass es fuer das
Erlangen von wichtigen Informationen wichtiger ist, zu den
unteren Ebenen gute Kontakte zu pflegen als zur Spitze von
Behoerden.  Herr Trusov vom russischen Umweltministeriums
(Minprirody RF) liess in einem Gespraech nicht einmal zu, in die
vorliegende uebersetzte Literatur aus der auslaendischen
Umweltgesetzgebung einzusehen.

Bei einem Vergleich von deutscher und russischer Normierungen im
Bereich der Folgen der Immissionen auf die Umwelt laesst sich
feststellen, dass das deutsche System staerker auf den
technologischen Aspekt der Immissionerzeugung setzt. Laut z.B.
13. BImSchV werden die Konzentrationen von Luftverunreinigungen
im Abgas bzw. im Abwasser begrenzt. Laut Russischem
Umweltschutzgesetz (Art. 26, 27) muss die Immissionskontrolle
unter anderen auch klimatische und andere Ortsbedingungen
beruecksichtigen, die mit der Produktionstechnologie gar nicht
viel zu tun haben. Man begrenzt und kontrolliert die
Umweltkonzentrationen, was fuer die Messverfahren schwerer und
teuerer ist. Die analytische Kontrolle von mehreren Grenzwerten
(z.B. von Schwermetallen) erfordert eine teure Laborausstattung,
die man sich in der Provinz nur selten leisten kann. Bei der
Grenzwert-Normierung selbst wird in Russland die technische
Moeglichkeit, den Grenzwert von Verunreinigungskonzentrationen
in der Umwelt durch moegliche Klaer- bzw. andere Verfahren zu
erreichen, nicht beruecksichtigt. Die Grenzwerte sind in
Russland haeufig sogar strenger als die der EU-Laender. Doch es
ist nicht schwer fuer russische Firmen, diese
Grenzwertkontrollen zu umgehen. <a name=L10008></a><a href=#L10009>So</a> z.B. werden immer wieder
nachts Abgase und Abwaesser abgegeben. Wenn dann am naechsten
Morgen eine Kontrolle stattfindet, laesst sich haeufig die
Verschmutzung nur noch schwer nachweisen.

BALTIKUM

Lettland unterzeichnet Oel-Geschaeft, Litauen veraergert

von Albert Caspari (Bremen) - Lettland unterzeichnete am 31.
Oktober 1995 einen Vertrag mit der amerikanischen
Oelgesellschaft AMOCO und der schwedischen OPAB ueber die Rechte
zur Ausbeutung eines moeglichen Oelvorkommens in der Ostsee und
heizte damit Konflikte mit dem Nachbarland Litauen zum genauen
Verlauf der Seegrenze zwischen beiden Laendern weiter an. Eine
Woche zuvor hatte sich Litauen noch auf ein im letzten Fruehjahr
abgeschlossenes Abkommen zwischen beiden Laendern berufen, das
vor Gespraechen mit Dritten eine Festlegung in dieser Frage fuer
verbindlich erklaert. Der lettische Ministerpraesident Maris
Gailis bezeichnete das jetzt abgeschlossene Abkommen, das einen
geschaetzten Wert von 1 Milliarde DM haben soll, als "wichtiges
Ereignis, das lange vorbereitet wurde." Die Uebereinkunft trete
sowieso nicht eher in Kraft bis ein Grenzabkommen mit Litauen
geschlossen sei. Gailis meinte weiter, er habe Litauen die
gleichmaessige Aufteilung der bisher umstrittenen Flaeche
vorgeschlagen. Mit "etwas gutem Willen" sei dieser Konflikt
innerhalb von ein paar Monaten zu loesen. Die erste Bohrung sei
dem Praesidenten der AMOCO Latvia, Valdis Budrevics zufolge,
fuer Ende 1996 vorgesehen. Diese koste zunaechst 7-9 Millionen
Dollar. Der naechste Schritt - die Erkundung der Groesse des
Vorkommens - sei dann mit 15 - 20 Millionen Dollar zu
veranschlagen. Der Text der Uebereinkunft teilt sowohl AMOCO als
auch OPAB je 45% der zukuenftigen Gewinne aus dem Oelgeschaeft
zu. 10% bleiben dem Staat Lettland. Das Abkommen muss allerdings
auch noch im neugewaehlten lettischen Parlament bestaetigt
werden. (Baltic Observer Nr. 43, 2. November 1995) Nach
Berichten des Baltic Observer vom 23.11. beginnt jetzt auch
Litauen mit Untersuchungen zur Vorbereitung eigener
Oelfoerderprojekte. 1996 will das litauische Energieministerium
Daten zu Oelvorkommen erarbeiten und bereits 1997 mit den ersten
Arbeiten beginnen. Drei Konzerne sind bereits mit
Oelfoerderungen in West-Litauen beschaeftigt: Die
litauisch-schwedische Genciu Nafta (Partern: Svenska Petroleum),
die daenisch-litauische Minijos Nafta (Partner: die daenische
Firma DONG) und der litauische Staatskonzern Geonafta.

Umweltgruppen in Lettland

von Albert Caspari (Bremen) - Wer Umweltgruppen in Lettland
kennenlernen moechte, kommt an dem "Vides Aizsardzibas Klubs",
abgekuerzt VAK, nicht vorbei. Da die alten Bueroraeume nach der
Wohnraumprivatisierung zu teuer wurden, sind dem VAK heute noch
drei kleine Raeume in der Audeju iela fuer Gruene Bibliothek und
VAK-Geschaeftsstelle geblieben. Arvids Ulme, Dichter,
Schriftsteller und Umweltaktivist, leitet den Klub jetzt schon
seit den grossen Protestaktionen in den 80er Jahren gegen den
U-Bahn-Bau in Riga, gegen den Ausbau ueberdimensionierter
Wasserkraftwerke an der Daugava oder gegen die Verschmutzung der
Ostsee. Ein kurzes Zwischenspiel im dann erstmals demokratisch
gewaehlten lettischen Parlament brachte ihn aber zu der
Ueberzeugung, lieber wieder voll der Arbeit an der Basis der
einzelnen Umweltgruppen zur Verfuegung stehen zu wollen. Um
Interessierten einen kleinen Ueberblick ueber die verschiedenen
Aktivitaeten zu bieten, haben wir im Folgenden die wichtigsten
Projekte und Projektverantwortlichen zusammengefasst.

VAK Vuestis (Bote) und EKO-LOGS (Fenster) sind zwei periodisch
erscheinende kleine Zeitungen, die einen aktuellen Ueberblick
ueber laufende Aktivitaeten des VAK geben moechten. EKO-LOGS
erscheint (mit Unterstuetzung der GRUeNEN-nahen Stiftung
BUNTSTIFT) teilweise in englisch. Einige Exemplare der
Zeitschrift EKO-LOGS stehen INFOBALT zur Verfuegung. Gegen
Voreinsendung von 3 DM in Briefmarken senden wir diese gerne zu. 

Die beste Anlaufstelle zur Information ist die Abteilung Ridzene
(Riga) des VAK, die auch als allgemeine Anlaufstelle des VAK
fungiert. ACHTUNG, GEAeNDERTE ADRESSE! Audeju iela 7/9,

Als wichtigste Aktivitaeten in Riga in der letzten Zeit benennt
der VAK selbst die Aktionen gegen die Eroeffnung eines
"McDonalds" im Stadtzentrum, Aktionen fuer den Stop der
franzoesischen Atombombenversuche (immerhin trugen sich etwa
4500 Menschen in entsprechende Unterschriftenlisten ein, die
gerade frisch und luxurioes renovierte franzoesische Botschaft
sah sich ein ums andere Mal belaestigt). Auch auf die
oekologischen Risiken, die durch den Bau der Oeresundbruecke
zwischen Daenemark und Schweden fuer den Ostseeschutz entstehen,
machte der VAK in Riga aufmerksam. Jedes Jahr finden ausserdem
im Herbst "Ostseetage" statt, in deren Rahmen viele freiwillige
Gruppen bei Strandreinigungsaktionen mitmachen. 

Die Gruene Bibliothek wurde 1990 gegruendet, nachdem 82 Kartons
einer Buecherspende der Barclay University aus Kalifornien
ankamen. Heute sind ca. 4.500 Titel aus den Bereichen
Umweltwissenschaft, Biologie, Anatomie, Botanik, Chemie,
Gartenbau, Energie, Recht, Geschichte, Philosophie und Marketing
ausleihbar. Diese werden durch 1.500 Titel verschiedener
Periodika und Nachschlagwerke ergaenzt. Mit Hilfe des "Regional
Environmental Center" (REC) verfuegt die Gruene Bibliothek ueber
computergestuetzte Daten, die bei wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten
oder der Organisation von Veranstaltungen zu Hilfe genommen
werden koennen.

Seminare zu fahrradfreundlicher Staedteplanung

foerdert das Regional Environmental Center (REC) in Klaipeda
(Litauen) und Liepaja (Lettland). Anfang Mai fand das erste von
zwei Seminaren zu fahrradfreundlicher Staedteplanung in Lettland
und Litauen statt. Ausrichter waren litauische Umweltgruppen in
Klaipeda, die dazu lettische Umweltschuetzer/innen eingeladen
hatten. Anfang naechsten Jahres wird ein zweites derartiges
Treffen in Liepaja/Lettland organisiert werden. Ausrichter wird
dann das dortige "Gruene Zentrum" des lettischen Umweltverbands
VAK in Liepaja sein. Langfristig sollen in beiden Staedten
Fahrradinformationszentren aufgebaut werden. Momentan sammeln

Belarus (Weissrussland)

Zwei gegensaetzliche Kongresse zu den Tschernobyl-Folgen

von Astrid Sahm - Vom 18.-22. Maerz 1996 fand in Minsk die
"Erste Internationale Konferenz der Europaeischen Kommission,
von Belarus, der Russischen Foederation und der Ukraine ueber
die radiologischen Konsequenzen des Unfalls von Tschernobyl"
statt. Auf dem von etwa 700 Teilnehmern aus 30 Laendern
besuchten Kongress wurden die Ergebnisse der 16 von der EG seit
1991 finanzierten Tschernobyl-Forschungsprojekte vorgestellt.
Insgesamt standen fuer das EG-Programm 23 Mio. ECU zur
Verfuegung, von denen etwa 40 Prozent direkt in den drei
betroffenen Republiken verwendet wurden, <a name=L10009></a><a href=#L10010>so</a> dass hier durch das
Programm tatsaechlich eine spuerbare Verbesserung der
wissenschaftlichen Infrastruktur in einzelnen
Forschungsbereichen erreicht werden konnte. Die langfristigen
Ziele des EG-Programms sind allerdings ambivalent zu bewerten:
Neben der Verringerung der gesundheitlichen Auswirkungen der
durch den Unfall ausgeloesten Strahlenexposition - ausser dem
Ansteigen von Schilddruesenkrebs bei Kindern wurden freilich
keine Veraenderungen der Erkrankungsbilder in den drei
Republiken in direkte Verbindung mit Tschernobyl gestellt
gehoeren hierzu die sozial-oekonomische Rehabilitierung der
kontaminierten Gebiete und die Verallgemeinerung der Erfahrungen
von Tschernobyl fuer den Umgang mit eventuellen Nuklearunfaellen
in der Zukunft. Das Verhalten der ukrainischen, russischen und
insbesondere der belarussischen Regierungsvertreter auf der
Konferenz glich dem Versuch einer Quadratur des Kreises, da
Praesident Alexander Lukaschenka und Tschernobyl-Minister Iwan
Kenik erstmals die Rehabilitation der belasteten Territorien
international zum Ziel ihrer Politik erklaerten, gleichzeitig
aber aus Angst vor nachlassenden internationalen Hilfeleistungen
bei einer bestaetigten Normalisierung des Lebens in der "Zone"
erschreckende Bilder ueber die Katastrophenauswirkungen
zeichneten. Als eine Art Gegenkongress veranstaltete die von
Gennadij und Irina Gruschewoj geleitete Stiftung "Fuer die
Kinder von Tschernobyl" Ende Maerz 1996 zum dritten Mal die
Konferenz "Die Welt nach Tschernobyl", an der etwa 500 Personen
aus 26 Laendern, darunter ca. 180 allein aus Deutschland,
teilnahmen. Dabei handelte es sich vor allem um Vertreter
unabhaengiger NRO. Leider bot das dichte Vortragsprogramm zu
uebergreifenden Themen kaum Raum fuer Dialoge und den Austausch
tiefergehender Informationen, <a name=L10010></a><a href=#L10011>so</a> dass die Chance nicht genutzt
wurde, beispielsweise ueber fundierte Grundprinzipien der
gesellschaftlichen humanitaeren Tschernobyl-Hilfe oder ueber
solide Argumente gegen die neuen Prinzipien der staatlichen
Tschernobyl-Politik weitergehende Verstaendigung zu erreichen. 

Jahrestag der Katastrophe als Brennpunkt der politischen
Konflikte

von Astrid Sahm - Der am 2. April 1996 von dem belarussischen
Praesidenten Alexander Lukaschenka und dem russischen
Praesidenten Boris Jelzin in Moskau unterzeichnete Vertrag ueber
die Gruendung einer "Gemeinschaft souveraener Staaten" (russ.
Abkuerzung: SSR!) rief unerwartet breiten Protest bei der
belarussischen Bevoelkerung, vor allem in Minsk, hervor und
fuehrte damit zu einer Zuspitzung der innenpolitischen
Situation. Die Belarussische Volksfront, die Vereinigte
Buergerpartei sowie andere nationale und liberale Kraefte
organisierten fuer den 26. April 1996 einen
"Tschernobyl-Marsch", der zum ersten Mal am 30. September 1989
ebenfalls in heftiger Konfrontation mit der damaligen Regierung
stattgefunden hatte. Da offensichtlich war, dass die
Demonstration sich politisch gegen den belarussisch-russischen
Vertrag richten wuerde, wurde die Demonstration von der
Stadtverwaltung nicht genehmigt. Im Verlauf der Demonstration
mit ueber 60.000 Teilnehmern kam es zu mehreren gewaltsamen
Auseinandersetzungen mit der Polizei. Nach der Demonstration
wurden etwa 200 Personen voruebergehend festgenommen. Zwei
stellvertretende Vorsitzende der Volksfront sassen drei Wochen
in Untersuchungshaft, ihr Prozess steht noch aus. Vertreter der
ukrainischen nationalistischen Organisation UNO-UNSA sowie
einige belarussische Politiker und Schriftsteller waren im Juli
noch immer in Untersuchungshaft. Bei den ca. 40 Schnellverfahren
gegen andere Demonstranten waren keine oeffentlichen Zeugen
zugelassen. Gegen die Verhaftungen sowie gegen die zahlreichen
staatlichen Einschuechterungsversuche gegen Journalisten in
Belarus gab es zahlreiche internationale Proteste. Amnesty
International hat in einer Urgent Action die verhafteten
Volksfrontaktivisten als politische Gefangene eingestuft. Auf
der ebenfalls am 26. April 1996 stattfindenden offiziellen
Tschernobyl-Gedenkveranstaltung der belarussischen Regierung
warf Praesident Alexander Lukaschenka der Opposition vor, das
Unglueck von Tschernobyl in unzulaessiger Weise fuer ihre
politische Zwecke zu instrumentalisieren. Die Inszenierung der
staatlichen Veranstaltung erfolgte dabei nach alten sowjetischen
Traditionen mit ausgewaehlten Kundgebungsteilnehmern, die nach
Regionen und Status mit Hinweisschildern in der Hand gruppiert
waren und bestellte Reden abzuliefern hatten. Der politischen
Legitimation von Lukaschenka sollte dabei auch die Teilnahme
hoher orthodoxer und katholischer Wuerdentraeger dienen. Der
Praesident wies zudem wiederholt darauf hin, dass die
belarussisch-russischen Vertraege auch die Bewaeltigung der
Probleme von Tschernobyl erleichtern wuerden. Im Juni 1996
erklaerte sich die russische Regierung tatsaechlich zur Zahlung
von 8,1 Mrd. russischen Rubel fuer konkrete
Tschernobyl-Projekte, wie den Bau einer Medikamentenfabrik in
Grodno, bereit. Die Opposition hatte hingegen stets verlangt,
dass Belarus durch eine internationale Klage Schadensersatz fuer
die von dem Land nicht selbst verschuldeten Auswirkungen von
Tschernobyl fordern solle. Neben der politischen Divergenzen
ueber die Konsequenzen der neuen Beziehungen zu Russland fuer
die belarussische Souveraenitaet waren jedoch auch die
Grundsaetze der staatlichen Tschernobyl-Politik Gegenstand
kontroverser Debatten am 10. Jahrestag der Katastrophe. <a name=L10011></a><a href=#L10012>So</a> hatte
das Ministerkabinett Anfang 1996 beschlossen, offiziell kein
neues umfassendes Tschernobyl-Staatsprogramm zu verabschieden,
sondern angesichts der schwierigen finanziellen Situation in der
Tschernobyl-Politik zukuenftig mit Hilfe von Jahresplaenen zu
agieren, wobei der bereits grundsaetzlich gebilligte
Staatsprogrammentwurf als Richtlinie dienen solle. Demgegenueber
bestand das belarussische Parlament in seiner
Tschernobyl-Anhoerung am 26. April 1996 auf der Ausarbeitung
eines neuen Staatsprogramms, das dem Parlament zur Abstimmung
vorgelegt werden muesse.

Regierung will direkte kontrolle ueber Westliche
Tschernobyl-Hilfe

von Astrid Sahm - Der autoritaere Ordnungsanspruch des
belarussischen Praesidenten Alexander Lukaschenka zeigt sich
auch im Bereich der Tschernobyl-Politik immer deutlicher. Bei
seinem Besuch in mehreren kontaminierten Doerfern des Brester,
Gomeler und Mogiljower Gebiets im April 1996 kritisierte der
Praesident zum wiederholten Male in scharfer Form, dass Empfang
und Verteilung der westlichen humanitaeren Hilfe fast
ausschliesslich in den Haenden gesellschaftlicher Organisationen
liege. Er verlangte, dass sich alle belarussischen
Tschernobyl-Organisationen in den naechsten drei Monaten einer
Neuregistrierung unterziehen muessen, und kuendigte die
Ausarbeitung eines Verfahrens an, das eine staatliche Kontrolle
der Verteilung humanitaerer Hilfe erlaube. Dass dies keine
leeren Drohungen waren, zeigte sich, als im Juni 1996 erstmals
den Vertretern von zwei italienischen Hilfsorganisationen die
Einreise nach Belarus verweigert wurde, weil sie nicht bereit
waren, ihre medizinischen Hilfslieferungen den staatlichen
Behoerden zur Weitergabe zu ueberlassen. Das Europaeische
Parlament aeusserte in einer Resolution am 20. Juni 1996 seinen
Protest gegen diese Praxis, "dass unabhaengige NRO ihre
medizinischen Lieferungen an die Regierung anstatt an die
Kinder, die sie benoetigen, liefern sollen, und fordert die
Behoerden auf, diesen Beschluss im Interesse ihrer eigenen
Buerger aufzuheben". Gleichzeitig machte das Europaeische
Parlament deutlich, dass eine Vertiefung der Beziehungen
zwischen Belarus und der Europaeischen Gemeinschaft von einer
Verbesserung der allgemeinen Menschenrechtssituation in Belarus
abhaenge. Belarus riskiert damit, selbst die zahlreichen
internationalen Tschernobyl-Kontakte zu verlieren und sich
international vollkommen zu isolieren, zumal die Anfang 1996
eingefuehrten neuen Steuern eine weitere Huerde fuer humanitaere
Hilfeleistungen aus dem Ausland errichtet haben und viele
private Organisationen abschrecken duerften. Vieles haengt nun
davon ab, ob das belarussische Parlament, dem ein Gesetzentwurf
ueber die humanitaere Hilfe zur Diskussion vorliegt, sich in
dieser Frage gegen die Praesidialgewalt durchzusetzen vermag.
Aus Angst davor, dass die Exekutive ihre Aktionsmoeglichkeiten
weitgehend einschraenken koennte, hatten die Vertreter von 14
gesellschaftlichen Tschernobyl-Organisationen sich bereits im
Maerz 1996 auf Initiative des von Gennadij Gruschewoj geleiteten
Fond "Fuer die Kinder von Tschernobyl" hin in Minsk getroffen,
um gemeinsam gegen derartige Plaene zu protestieren und einen
"Koordinationsrat der gesellschaftlichen
Tschernobyl-Vereinigungen in der Republik Belarus" zu gruenden.
Nachdem in den vergangenen Jahren analoge
Koordiniierungsversuche u.a. an den unterschiedlichen Zielen und
Ambitionen der beteiligten NRO gescheitert waren, bleibt
abzuwarten, ob die Ausnahmesituation des Jahres 1996 eine
Ueberwindung derartiger Hindernisse und damit eine erfolgreiche
Koordinierung erlaubt. Wuenschenswert ist sie seit langem.

POLEN

Urlaub in der Gruenen Lunge Polens

von Karl Kerschgens - Geht das individual zu zweit, ohne
Gruppentour? Kaum jemand ist im Nordosten Polens mit Bahn und
Leihrad unterwegs. Die Gegend gilt als touristisch wenig
erschlossen. Ueblich sind Bustouren, die schon in Deutschland
gebucht werden oder Tagestouren aus dem Masurenland. Bei uns
ging es <a name=L10012></a><a href=#L10013>so</a>: im Schlafwagen bis Warschau, dann im Expresszug nach
Bialystok, dort zwei Uebernachtungen im Hotel Cristal (vorher
reservieren empfehlenswert). In Bialystok haben wir das Buero
von Bird Service Tours (Maciej Zimowski) aufgesucht, zwei
Treckingraeder (deutsches Fabrikat) gemietet und eine
neuntaegige Tour mit Gepaecktransport und Wegbeschreibung
abgesprochen. Erstes Ziel: Hajnwka (75 km) am westlichen Rand
der Puszcza Bialowieska(aeltester polnischer Nationalpark,
Kernzone darf nur mit Fuehrung, die fuer uns arrangiert wurde,
betreten werden). Der bewirtschaftete Teil des Waldes eignet
sich hervorragend fuer Radwanderungen auf den Wirtschaftswegen.
Zimmer im Hotel PTTK auf niedrigem Niveau, Kueche gut. Zweites
Ziel: Waniewo am Narew, der zusammen mit der Biebrza ein grosses
Sumpfgebiet bildet mit vielen Becken und Armen, die fast das
ganze Jahr ueberflutet sind, ein Paradies fuer viele seltene
Vogelarten und den Biber. Beste Beobachtungszeit Ende April bis
Ende Mai. Dort ist die Stiftung Europaeisches Naturerbe mit dem
Nordpolasischen Bund fuer Vogelschutz aktiv. Unterkunft in
Bauernhaeusern. Drittes Ziel: Tykocin, ebenfalls am Narew in
einem neuen schoenen Landhaus (Kiermusy), Ausgangspunkt fuer
Vogelbeobachtungen in den Biebrza-Suempfen. Die Strecke dorthin
laesst sich leider nur im Auto oder Kleinbus zuruecklegen.
Viertes Ziel: Augustw: mit der Bahn von Bialystok, schoene
Pension am Neckosee, mit zu stolzen Preisen gemieteten
Mountainbikes konnten wir Touren durch die Puszcza Augustwska
und zu vielen Seen, u.a. zum Wigrysee unternehmen. Ausserdem
sind Touren mit dem Paddelboot sehr reizvoll. Alles in allem ein
naturnahes und sanftes Reisen. Die meisten Wege und Strassen
sind auch wegen des noch geringen Verkehrsaufkommens angenehm
befahrbar, schwierig sind sandige Waldwege und meist
Innerortsstrassen mit Kopfsteinpflaster.Wir koennen eine
Individualradtour mit Hilfe von Bird Service in Bialystok
empfehlen, wenn auch organisatorisch nicht immer alles perfekt
war. Nachahmern geben wir gern Informationen. Ausgesprochen
aufregend und einmalig sollen Vogelbeobachtungen in den
Biebzra-Suempfen im Mai sein, was aber nur in einer Gruppe
machbar ist. Wer ist an einer solchen Reisegruppe interessiert?

Deutsche und Polen wollen Umweltschutz gemeinsam vorantreiben

Dresden (dpa), 03.07.1996 - Deutschland und Polen wollen ihre
Zusammenarbeit beim Umweltschutz weiter ausbauen. Darauf
verstaendigten sich Bundesumweltministerin Angela Merkel (CDU)
und ihr polnischer Amtskollege Stanislaw Zelichowski in Dresden
anlaesslich einer Tagung des deutsch-polnischen Umweltrates.
Beide Laender wollen ihre gemeinsamen Anstrengungen zur
Verbesserung der Wasserqualitaet in Oder und Ostsee verstaerken
sowie den Naturschutz beiderseits der Grenze vorantreiben, hiess
es zum Abschluss der zweitaegigen Konferenz, an der auch die
Ressortchefs von Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg und Sachsen
teilnahmen. Eine spuerbaren Beitrag zum Schutz der Ostsee
erhoffen sich beide Seiten unter anderem von den
deutsch-polnischen Pilotprojekten beim Bau von Klaeranlagen.
Fuer die beiden Projekte in Swinemuende und Guben stellt
Deutschland rund 27 Millionen Mark zur Verfuegung. Seit 1990
wurden im Ostsee-Einzugsgebiet von Mecklenburg-Vorpommern 38
Klaeranlagen gebaut oder modernisiert. Auf deutscher Seite sank
der Phosphateintrag in den vergangenen zehn Jahren auf weniger
als ein Fuenftel der frueheren Werte.

RUMAeNIEN

Atomkraftwerk westlicher Bauart ging in Rumaenien in Betrieb

Bukarest (dpa), 17.04.1996, 11.07.1996 - Das erste Atomkraftwerk
westlicher Bauart in Osteuropa ist im rumaenischen Cernavoda am
Donau-Schwarzmeer-Kanal in Betrieb gegangen. Das Kraftwerk mit
seinen bisherigen Baukosten von 2,2 Milliarden US-Dollar (3,3
Milliarden Mark) gilt als groesste Investition in der Geschichte
Rumaeniens. Die kanadische Firma "Atomic Energy of Canada
Limited" (AECL) war massgeblich am Bau des Reaktors beteiligt.
Er ging im Beisein des kanadischen Ministerpraesidenten Jean
Chretien, seines rumaenischen Amtskollegen Nicolae Vacaroiu, des
rumaenischen Staatspraesidenten Ion Iliescu und von Vertretern
der Internationalen Atomenergiebehoerde in Wien in Betrieb. Der
erste Reaktor soll im Juni seine volle Leistung erreichen und
mit 700 Megawatt Strom ein Zehntel des Landesbedarfs decken.
Geplant sind vier weitere Reaktoren. Das Kraftwerk galt lange
als Prestige-Projekt des 1989 gestuerzten kommunistischen
Diktators Nicolae Ceausescu. 1978 hatte Rumaenien den ersten
Vertrag mit kanadischen und italienischen Partnern geschlossen.
Mit dem Bau wurde 1979 begonnen. Da sich die Fertigstellung
verzoegerte, mussten nach der Wende 1989 die meisten technischen
Einrichtungen durch neue ausgetauscht werden. Wegen moeglicher
Umweltprobleme gab es im vergangenen Jahr Proteste lokaler
Behoerden, als bekannt wurde, dass das Kuehlwasser mit
radioaktivem Tritium in den Donau-Schwarzmeer-Kanal und in die
Donau geleitet wird, aus denen die 400 000 Bewohner von
Cernavoda und der Hafenstadt Constanta ihr Trinkwasser beziehen.
Nach Angaben der Behoerden in Bukarest soll die Radioaktivitaet
der natuerlichen Strahlung entsprechen. 

Das rumaenische Kernkraftwerk Cernavoda am
DonauSchwarzmeer-Kanal hat Anfang Juli seinen kommerziellen
Betrieb aufgenommen. Wie der staatliche rumaenische Rundfunk
berichtete, ist der im April dieses Jahres eingeweihte erste
Reaktor nach Abschluss weiterer Pruef-Verfahren an das nationale
Stromnetz angeschlossen worden.

Neue Schlaege gegen eingesperrten Umweltschuetzer Nikitin

Von Renfrey Clarke, Moskau (Uebersetzung Axel Horn) - Einer der
haesslichsten Angriffe auf die Menschenrechte in der juengeren
russischen Geschichte nahm eine unheilvolle Wendung am 10. Juni
96. Dem gefangengehaltenen Anti-Atom-Aktivist Alexander Nikitin
wurde die Freilassung gegen Kaution versagt, und sein Verfahren
wurde vom Zivilgericht an ein Militaergericht uebergeben.
Nikitin, ein frueherer Kapitaen zur See wird in einem St
Petersburg Gefaengnis unter Spionagevorwurf festgehalten, seit
er am 6. Februar 96 vom Bundessicherheitsdienst (FSB - dem
frueheren KGB) festgenommen worden war. Er hat eine
Mindeststrafe von 10 Jahren Gefaengnis oder als Hoechststrafe
die Exekution zu erwarten. Weder Nikitin noch seinem
Rechtsanwalt, dem bekannten Buergerrechtsanwalt Yury Schmidt,
wurde erlaubt, an der Verhandlung am 10. Juni teilzunehmen. Die
Anhoerung nahm die Form einer geschlossenen Geschaeftsuebergabe
von einem FSB-Anklaeger an einen Zivilrichter an. Als ein
Forscher fuer die norwegische Umweltgruppe, der Bellona
Foundation, half Nikitin, einen Bericht ueber die radioaktive
Verseuchung der Umwelt durch die Nordmeer-Flotte der russischen
Marine vorzubereiten. Die Marinebehoerden behaupteten, dass
Nikitin Bellona geheime Information offengelegt haette. Jedoch
bestehen der eingesperrte Aktivist und seine Unterstuetzer
darauf, dass alle im Bericht enthaltene Informationen aus nicht
klassifizierten Quellen frei verfuegbar waren. Bellonas Bericht,
der am 19. April schliesslich veroeffentlicht wurde, malte ein
entsetzliches Bild der Nachlaessigkeit im Bereich der Sicherheit
beim Umgang mit Atommuell bei der Nordmeer-Flotte. Ein Bellona
Sprecher in Oslo vertrat die Ansicht, das FSB wolle eine
Militaergerichtsverfahren gegen Nikitin, weil das Gericht
nicht-oeffentlich arbeite, und die Sicherheitsverwaltung mehr
Kontrolle ueber Schmidts Fuehrung der Verteidigung habe. Diese
Angelegenheiten in einem von der Moskauer Tageszeitung Izvestiya
am 8. Juni herausgegebenen Interview ansprechend, behauptete
Schmidt, dass das Verfahren darauf vorbereitet wuerde, maximale
Verletzungen der Rechte seines Klienten zu ermoeglichen. Ein
Militaergerichtsverfahren wuerde "nicht die Wahrscheinlichkeit
ausschliessen, dass der Fall in einer befangenen,
buerokratischen Art verhandelt wuerde", stellte Schmidt fest. In
demselben Interview fuehrte Schmidt an, dass die Forderung des
FSBs nach einem Militaergerichtsverfahren einer Regel des
Verfassungsgericht, Russlands hoechster juristischer Institution
zuwiderlaeuft. In einer Entscheidung am 27. Maerz getroffenen
Entscheidung befand das Verfassungsgericht, dass Leute, die vom
Spionagevorwurf betroffen sind, das Recht haetten, von einer
Vertretung ihrer Wahl von durch das FSB ernannte Rechtsanwaelte
verteidigt zu werden. Wenn Nikitins Fall vor einem
militaerischen Gericht verhandelt wird, ist die Aussicht auf
eine normale Verteidigung scharf beschraenkt. Die Frage, ob die
Verhandlung in einem geschlossenen Gericht stattfindet, kann
entscheidend sein, wenn, wie Schmidt erwartet, das FSB den Fall
in einer hoch unsachgemaessen Art strafrechtlich verfolgt. Die
Experten der Marine, die Materialien fuer die Anklage
vorbereiteten, taten es, wie Schmidt gegenueber Izvestiya sagte,
nicht aufgrund der russischen Verfassung oder des vor kurzem
uebernommenen Gesetzes ueber Staatsgeheimnisse, sondern von
"alten Anweisungen des Verteidigungsministers, die der
Verfassung und dem Gesetz widersprechen." Nach Ausfuehrungen von
Schmidt lag die Basis der Anklagevorwuerfe gegen Nikitin in
Ereignissen, die 30 bis 35 Jahre zurueckliegen. Aber das Gesetz
ueber Staatsgeheimnisse gibt an, dass die Maximallaenge der
Zeit, fuer welches Material als geheim klassifiziert werden
kann, 30 Jahre seien. Inzwischen erwies sich ein Dokument, das
von den Marine-Experten als "streng geheime Information"
anfuehrten, als eine gekuerzte Version eines Izvestiya Artikels
vom Maerz 1995. Bellona Aktivisten sagen, dass Versuche ihre
Quellen als Beweise in die Untersuchung einzubringen, abgelehnt
worden sind. Letztendlich, <a name=L10013></a><a href=#L10014>so</a> sagte Schmidt Izvestiya, sei das
einzige "Geheime", auf das er in dem Fall gestossen sei, der
leidenschaftliche Wunsch der Militaers, die katastrophale
Situation im Bereich der Kernsicherheit zu verdecken, zusammen
mit dem Wunsch des FSB, seine Nuetzlichkeit zu beweisen. Das
verzweifelt und stuemperhaft wirkende Vorgehen von Militaer und
Sicherheitsbehoerden sollte natuerlich nicht dazu fuehren, die
Ernsthaftigkeit ihres Bestrebens zu unterschaetzen, im Lande die
Menschen mundtot zu machen, die oekologische Missstaende
aufzeigen. Die Izvestiya-Ausgabe vom 8. Juni enthielt auch einen
Bericht ueber ein Journalistengespraech mit einem FSB Ermittler
aus St Petersburg, der am Nikitin Fall arbeitete. Der FSB Agent,
der darum bat, nicht genannt zu werden, sagte aus, dass weitere
Anklagen gegen Nikitin und auch gegen andere Personen erhoben
werden koennten.

Russland baut das erste schwimmende Atomkraftwerk der Welt

(Uebersetzung: Axel Horn, Sauerlach) - Der Bau des ersten
schwimmenden Atomkraftkraftwerks der Welt wurde in Russland
begonnen. Die Ingenieure sind bester Hoffnung, ihr Projekt zum
Jahr 2001 anwendungsbereit zu haben, eine Aussicht, die
Umweltschuetzer mit Entsetzen fuellt, aber Russland im Sueden
nach potentiellen Kaeufer ausschauen laesst. Andrei Gagarinsky,
Vizepraesident der russischen KernenergieGesellschaft und Kopf
von internationalen Beziehungen am Kurchatov Institut in Moskau
bestaetigte diese Woche gegenueber IPS, dass das erste der
Kraftwerke nach Jahren von finanziellen Verzoegerungen in Bau
ist. Umweltschuetzer dagegen betonen, dass die Bedrohung durch
von Oeltankern verursachten oekologischen Katastrophen,
vernachlaessigbar gegenueber einer maritimen Katastrophe sein
wird, wie sie ein schwimmendes Atomkraftkraftwerk ausloesen
kann. Russland hatte seit langem Plaene dafuer gehabt, eine
Serie von kleinen schwimmenden Atomkraftkraftwerken fuer den
Einsatz in entfernten Regionen zu bauen, die nicht mit dem
nationalen Stromversorgungsnetz verbunden werden, oder grosse
Atomkraftkraftwerke ersetzen, die wegen hoher
Treibstofftransportkosten zu teuer geworden sind. "Russland
braucht mindestens 15 kleine, schwimmende
ModulAtomkraftkraftwerke" sagt Gagarinsky. "Sie werden gebraucht
in unzugaenglichen Regionen des Fernen Ostens, des aeussersten
Nordens, im Altay Gebiet und der Kola Halbinsel". Er bemerkte,
dass Russland der Weltfuehrer in der Produktion kleiner
Atomkraftkraftwerke sei und diese als potentielle Exportprodukte
besonders fuer Entwicklungslaender betrachte. Er fuegte hinzu,
dass Indonesien, Suedkorea, China und Vietnam alle Interesse
geaeussert haetten. Aber westliche Umweltschuetzer sind nicht
ueberzeugt. "Ein wesentlicher Bereich, der hinsichtlich dieser
Kraftwerke Sorge bereitet, ist das Reaktorcontainment", sagte
Antony Froggatt von der Greenpeace Nuclear Campaign in London.
"Die Tschernobyl Explosion blies den Reaktordeckel, einen 2,000
Tonnen-Betonblock in die Luft". Diese Schiffe haben nicht einmal
diese Art von Schutz. Dies stellt ein klares Risiko sowohl fuer
die Meeresumwelt als auch die der benachbarten Landgebiete dar".
Das schwimmende Kraftwerk ist im Grunde genommen ein Schiff mit
zwei kleinen Druckwasserreaktoren (PWRs) vom Typ KLT-40s, die
eine Weiterentwicklung der auf Russlands Nuklear-Eisbrechern
verwendeten Reaktoren sind.". Der Druckwasserreaktor KLT-40 mit
verbesserter Sicherheit, entwickelt vom
Forschungs-Konstruktionsbuero fuer Maschinenbau in Nizhny
Novgorod OKBM, wurde seit 20 Jahren verwendet, um sowohl die
sieben Kerneisbrecher als auch nukleargetriebene Frachtschiffe
der UdSSR anzutreiben. Waehrend dieser Zeit - ueber 130
Reaktorjahre - sei es (im Unterschied zur U-BootFlotte, d.
Uebersetzer) zu keinen groesseren Unfaelle gekommen, die den
KLT-Reaktor betreffen. Die Reaktoren haben je eine
Ausgangsleistung des 35-50 Megawatt (MW), dem Kraftwerk eine
allgemeine Leistung von bis zu 100 MW elektrischer Leistung oder
50 MW el plus thermische Leistung. Ausser den OKBM waren das
Kurchatov Institut in Moskau und das Aisberg Entwurfsbuero in
St. Petersburg am Konstruktionsentwurf des Kraftwerks beteiligt,
das jetzt auf der Baltisky Schiffswerft in St. Petersburg gebaut
wird. Das erste Kraftwerk wird am arktischen Seehafen von Pivek
an der Chukotka Halbinsel im fernen Nordosten gelegt. Das
Bedienungspersonal besteht aus 40 - 50 Leuten, die im
Schichtbetrieb arbeiten. Die vorgesehene Lebensdauer des
Kraftwerks ist etwa 40 Jahre. Der abgebrannte Kernbrennstoff und
Abfaelle werden an Bord gelagert. Alle 13 Jahre wird das
Kraftwerk 4,000 Kilometer durch die arktischen Meere nach
Murmansk an der Kola Halbinsel in Russlands Nordwesten
geschleppt, um dort gewartet und mit frischem Atombrennstoff
beladen zu werden. Waehrend dieser Ueberholung, die ein Jahr
dauert, wird ein anderes Kraftwerks-Modul als Ersatz die Stelle
einnehmen. Man erwartet, dass eine Kraftwerkseinheit 254
Millionen Dollar kostet, und dass der Bau sechs Jahre dauert.
Bei spaeterer Serienfertigung, sagt OBKM-Direktor Fjodor
Mitenkov, soll bei zeitgleicher Fertigung von Reaktor,
schwimmender Basis und Zusatzeinrichtungen die Bauzeit auf
gerade einmal dreieinhalb Jahre nach dem Unterschreiben eines
Vertrags und der Stueckpreis auf 180 Millionen Dollar reduziert
werden. Die elektrische Energie vom Kraftwerk soll fuenfmal
billiger als aus jeder anderen Quelle sein. Es gibt etwa 50
passende Standorte fuer solche Reaktoren entlang Russlands
arktischer Kuestenlinie. Nach Alexander Poloushkin,
Generaldirektor der Malaya Energetika ("Kleine Energie")
Forschungs- und Produktionsgesellschaft, koennen die
Kernkraftwerks-Module einen hohen Prozentanteil des Strom- und
Waermebedarfs in diesen Regionen decken. Er besteht darauf, dass
das Kraftwerk sehr sicher sein wird: "Das Kraftwerk hat
verlaessliche Schutzsysteme, um es vor allen moeglichen Risiken,
auch Untergang oder Kentern, und sogar wenn ein Flugzeug, darauf
abstuerzt, zu schuetzen", sagt er. "Es belastet seine Umgebung
mit keinem Nuklearmuell, weil dieser an Bord gelagert wird."
Aehnliche Meinungen wurden von Nikolai Filozov, einem Sprecher
der russischen Atomaufsichtsbehoerde Gosatomnadzor geaeussert.
Aber Froggatt wies darauf hin, dass die meisten PWRs Probleme
mit ihren Dampfgeneratoren haben, die letztlich zu Unfaellen mit
Leckage des Kuehlkreislaufes und Verlust der Kuehlung fuehren
koennen. Ein Schiffsreaktorunfall auf einer Schiffswerft an der
russischen Pazifik-Kueste toetete 1985 mehrere Menschen und hat
Bereiche der Chazma Bucht nachhaltig kontaminiert. Die im
Wesentlichen staatseigene Malaya Energetika Gesellschaft hofft,
den Reaktorentwurf international zu vermarkten. Poloushkin
glaubt, dass es einen Markt fuer mindestens 100 Einheiten gibt.
Seine Gesellschaft hofft, die Kraftwerke nach China, Indonesien,
den Philippinen und in andere Laendern zu verkaufen. Es gibt
Plaene zur Verwendung des KLT-40 als Basis fuer eine schwimmende
oder an der Kueste errichtete Meerwasserentsalzungsanlage
(APVS-40), fuer ein unterirdisches Kraftwerk und ein
Kuestenkraftwerk, bei denen der Reaktor von See her angeliefert
wird. Die einem KLT-40 und zwei Entsalzungseinheiten bestehende
APVS-40 Entsalzungsanlage kann einen Tag bis zu 80,000
Kubikmeter Wasser liefern. Das APVS-40 Kraftwerk wurde von
denselben drei Organisationen zusammen mit dem Yekaterinburg
Forschungs- und Entwicklungsinstitut von chemischem Maschinenbau
gestaltet. Es hat schon betraechtliches Interesse an diesem
Entwurf aus Laendern im Nahen Osten, Afrika Lateinamerika und
Asien gegeben. 1992 eroerterte das Kurchatov Institut einen
moegliche Vertrag, um ein Kraftwerk an Israel zu liefern, aber
die Verhandlungen wurden abgebrochen sind, weil Israel den
Atomwaffen-Sperrvertrag noch nicht unterschrieben hat.

Seit Jahresbeginn sechs tote Ussuri-Tiger:

Moskau (dpa) 07.07.1996 - Die im russischen Fernen Osten
lebenden Tiger und Leoparden sind unveraendert vom Aussterben
bedroht. Seit Jahresbeginn seien im Primorje-Gebiet sechs
Ussuri-Tiger ums Leben gekommen, meldete die Nachrichtenagentur
Interfax am Samstag unter Berufung auf regionale Behoerden. Die
Mehrzahl der Tiger sei Opfer von Wilderern geworden. Im
Primorje-Gebiet leben etwa 200 Tiger. Die genau Anzahl soll
Mitte August bekanntgegeben werden, wenn die laufende Zaehlung
beendet ist. Besonders bedroht seien auch die im Primorje-Gebiet
lebenden Leoparden. Seit 1991, als etwa 30 Leoparden in der
Region gezaehlt worden seien, habe sich die Anzahl der Leoparden
um etwa ein Drittel verringert, hiess es unter Berufung auf die
regionale Umweltbehoerde. Insgesamt lebten im Primorje-Gebiet
und angrenzenden Regionen kaum mehr als 50 Exemplare dieser
seltenen Raubtiere. Auf dem Schwarzmarkt wuerden in Asien fuer
ein Tiger- oder Leopardenfell einige zehntausend US-Dollar
gezahlt.

Kurzmeldungen:

Atomvertrag zwischen Moskau und Paris (Reuter, SDZ, 10. 6. 1996)

Paris - Frankreich und Russland haben einen Vertrag ueber die
Zusammenarbeit in der zivilen Atomtechnik unterzeichnet. Er
sieht unter anderem vor, dass russische Atom-Spezialisten in dem
vor 30 Jahren von Frankreich und Deutschland gegruendeten
Max-von- Laue/Paul-Langevin-Institut in Grenoble mitarbeiten
duerfen. Im Gegenzug dafuer wird Russland neun Jahre lang
jaehrlich 55 Kilogramm hochangereichertes Uran an das Institut
liefern. Zudem soll der franzoesische Forschungsreaktor in
Saclay 125 Kilogramm Uran erhalten.

(von Axel Horn) Mochovce ist der Name eines frueheren kleinen
Dorfs in Suedslowakei, das in der zweiten Haelfte der 80er Jahre
aufgrund des Baus des Atomkraftwerks voellig zerstoert wurde.
Diese Entscheidung der Praesidentschaft der tschechoslowakischen
Regierung wurde ohne jede Diskussion mit den lokalen Leuten
genehmigt und durchgefuehrt, wie es in allen Laendern mit
kommunistischem Regime ueblich war. Die Genehmigung fuer den Bau
wurde 1978 gegeben. Nach den urspruenglichen Planungen, sollte
das Atomkraftwerk (AKW) Mochovce 4 Reaktoren vom Typ WWER
440/213 haben, mit einer Leistung von 4 x 440 MW. Zur Zeit sind
die Bloecke 1 und 2 im Bau weiter fortgeschritten (mit dem in
Block 1 bereits installierten Reaktordruckbehaelter), waehrend
die Bloecke 3 und 4 nur im Rohbau stehen. Die Reaktortechnologie
ist russisch, aber waehrend des Baus wurden viele Aenderungen
durchgefuehrt, und u.a. ein neues Kontrollsystem von Siemens
installiert. Vom technologischen Standpunkt her unterscheidet
sich das AKW deutlich vom Projekt, das urspruenglich die
Baugenehmigun erhielt. Das Atomkraftwerk Mochovce (JEMO) sollte
vom Staatsbudget und dem Investor, dem slowakischen
Energieversorgungsunternehmen (SE frueheres Staatsunternehmen,
seit 1994 100% Staatsaktiengesellschaft) finanziert werden.
Aufgrund schwerer finanzieller Probleme des Staates und der
hohen Verschuldung von SE, wurde das JEMO Projekt 1991 gestoppt.
Seitdem suchte die Leitung des slowakischen Energiesektors
westliche Anleger, die sich an der Fertigstellung des AKW
beteiligen koennten. Die Meinung von allen slowakischen
Regierungen ist bis heute <a name=L10014></a><a href=#L10015>so</a> geblieben, JEMO in jedem Fall
fertigzustellen. Die Bemuehungen fuehrten zur Kooperation von SE
mit Electricite de France, Bayernwerk und Preussen Elektra. Im
Jahr 1994 schufen SE und EdF sogar eine Aktiengesellschaft, die
EMO genannt wird, und an der EdF einen 51% Anteil hatte. Diese
Partner haben einen Plan zur Fertigstellung des AKW Mochovce
ausgearbeitet, dessen Umsetzung von einem Konsortium von
westlichen Banken finanziert werden sollte. Die entscheidende
Rolle zur Finanzierung von JEMO fiel der Europaeischen Bank fuer
Wiederaufbau und Entwicklung (EBRD) zu, die einen Kredit von 412
Millionen DM fuer das Projekt liefern sollte. Die Gesamtsumme
fuer die Kosten des Projektes erreichten 1,45 Mrd DM. In der
geaenderten gesellschaftlichen Situation nach 1989 bauten die
Umweltorganisationen "Kinder der Erde" und "Greenpeace" den
Widerstand auf, nachdem das Projekt 1992/93 oeffentlich bekannt
geworden war. Trotz grosser Probleme damit, jede Information
(sogar offizielle Information) zu bekommen, unguenstiger Presse
und teilweise sogar einer feindlichen oeffentlichen Antwort
entwickelten sie die intensive Kampagne "Stoppt Mochovce".
Andere slowakische und auslaendisches NGOs schlossen sich der
Kampagne an, und Greenpeace Oesterreich koordinierte die
landesweit starke Ablehnung des Projekts in Oesterreich, was
entscheidend fuer den bisherigen Widerstand war. Schliesslich
fuehrte die Opposition zu einer breiten internationalen
Kampagne, deren Hauptziel war, die westlichen Firmen und
besonders die EBRD zu hindern, das Projekt in Mochovce
durchzufuehren. Die NGOs verwendeten ein Spektrum von
verschiedenen Aktivitaeten, mit:

Direktem Kontakt mit der Oeffentlichkeit "vor Ort",
Informations- und PR-Aktivitaeten.

Breiter Medienenarbeit (lokal, international), die von
beschraenkten journalistischen Moeglichkeiten bestimmt ist.

Intensivem Kontakt und Lobbyarbeit speziell bei der EBRD
(persoenliche Gespraeche, Korrespondenz, eine
Unterschriftenliste mit ungefaehr 1.2 Millionen Unterschriften,
hauptsaechlich aus Oesterreich).

Enge Kooperation mit Experten fuer detaillierte Argumention - in
der Slowakei wollen sich die meisten Experten oder Beamten
leider nicht oeffentlich aeussern, wenn sie gegen die Position
von Regierung oder Verwaltung sind.

Zusammenarbeit mit politischen Koerperschaften sowohl in den
jeweiligen Laendern als auch auf der europaeischen Ebene (z.B.
zwei Resolutionen vom Europaparlament)

Proteste, Demonstrationen und direkten Aktionen - die
spektakulaerste war das Aufhaengen eines riesigen Transparents
auf der Oberseite des Mochovce Kuehlturms, 1994 ausgefuehrt von
Greenpeace.

Eines der wichtigsten Elemente der Kampagne war die Verwendung
von oeffentlichen Beteiligungsmechanismen und der Druck auf die
EBRD. <a name=L10015></a><a href=#L10016>So</a> mussten die westlichen Investoren einige klare
Bedingungen ihrer Beteiligung im JEMO-Projekt aufstellen - z.B.
international akzeptable Sicherheitsstandards, die Ausarbeitung
einer LeastCost-Option fuer die Bloecke 1 und 2, Stillegung von
zwei laufenden Reaktoren des AKW Bohunice, Liberalisierung der
Energiepreise, effiziente Energienutzung, etc.. Schliesslich
entschied die EBRD, die die Dokumentation des Projekts fuer eine
regulaere Oeffentlichkeitsbeteiligung bereitzustellen, die
oeffentliche Anhoerungen in der Slowakei, Ungarn und
Oesterreich. Das war ein sehr schwieriger Prozess, da die
Projektbetreiber unwillig zur Zusammenarbeit waren und einige
unfaire Schritte unternahmen, und da Verwirrung ueber die
Vorgehensweise auf Seiten der EBRD bestand. Oeffentliche
Anhoerungen fanden Januar/Februar 1995 mit grosser
Aufmerksamkeit von Oeffentlichkeit und Medien statt. Die
Anhoerung in Wien wurde jedoch nicht realisiert, weil sich
SE-Vertreter weigerten, dort teilzunehmen. Aber 83 slowakische
Umweltgruppen ueberreichten ihre Einwendungen zu den ernsten
Maengeln und ungeloesten Problemen die Sicherheit,
Wirtschaftlichkeit und Umweltauswirkungen des Projekts
betreffend. Die Umweltschuetzer aeusserten viele ernste
Vorbehalte und Argumente gegen das Projekt. Eines der
wichtigsten ist das Problem der Verbindung originalrussischer
Technologie mit unvermeidlichen Sicherheitsverbesserungen
gewesen, die nirgends in der Welt bisher durchgefuehrt worden
sind. Jegliche zusaetzlichen Massnahmen koennen die
unzulaengliche Sicherheit der Originalkonstruktion (z.B.
fehlendes Reaktorcontainment, unzulaenglicher Brandschutz,
internen Ueberflutungen, Absturz externer Objekte usw.) nicht
loesen. <a name=L10016></a><a href=#L10017>So</a> waere JEMO nicht in der Lage, westlichen
Sicherheitsstandards zu entsprechen. Dies alles konnte
unvorhergesehene Sicherheitsprobleme verursachen. Die Probleme
der letzten Phase des Kernbrennstoffkreislaufs (Entsorgung
radioaktiven Abfalls einschliesslich des verbrauchten
Kernbrennstoffes, Stillegung des Kraftwerks usw.) sind nicht
geloest worden. Die Projektkosten waren unpassend hoch, und die
Bedingungen des vorbereiteten Vertrags diskriminierten stark die
Interessen der Slowakei. Zum Beispiel wurden die slowakischen
Partner mit allen Verantworlichkeiten fuer Betrieb,
Abfallentsorgung, Haftungsfragen, Kreditrueckzahlung, Tilgung
von Altschulden usw. belastet. Andererseits basierte der hohe
wirtschaftliche Gewinn der westlichen Partner auf dem niedrigen
Preis der elektrischen Energie, die fuer die Kreditrueckzahlung
exportiert werden sollte. Am Ende war das Projekt nicht die
kostenguenstigste Option fuer die Deckung des Energiebedarfs der
Slowakei in Vergleich mit dem Energiepotential anderer
Loesungen. Schwere Umweltprobleme, die mit der radioaktiven
Abfallagerung und der Freisetzung von Radioaktivitaet in die
Umwelt (Kontamination des zweitgroessten slowakischen Flusses
Hron) verbunden waren, blieben ungeloest. Letztlich basierten
die wichtigsten Teile der Projektdokumentation auf Spekulation
und ungerechtfertigten Argumenten und wurden ohne konkrete
Berechnungen und genaue Daten dargestellt. Im Maerz erbat die
slowakische Regierung mehrere Tage vor der letzten Besprechung
des Rates der EBRD Direktoren offiziell um eine Verschiebung der
Entscheidung der Bank. Die Regierung rechtfertigte dieses
ueberraschende Verlangen mit dem vorteilhafteren Angebot der
tschechischen Firma Skoda Prague fuer die Fertigstellung von
JEMO. Seitdem ist ein halbes Jahr ohne jede oeffentliche
Information vergangen. Waehrend dieser langen Zeit ignorierte
der Projektbeauftragte dringende Appelle von NGOs, zumindest ein
Minimum an der Information zu erhalten. Endgueltig im September
1995 lieferte die Regierung den Vorschlag des neuen
Finanzierungsmodells fuer JEMO. Der neue Vorschlag basiert auf
dem potentiellen Investitionskredit der russischen Foederation
(80 Millionen USD) und zweier tschechischer Banken (200, bzw.
130 Millionen USD). Aber diese potentiell verfuegbare Summe
deckt einzig die Haelfte der Gesamtkosten, die fuer das neuen
Finanzierungskonzept angegeben sind - 840 Millionen USD. Andere
potentielle Quellen waren grundsaetzlich unannehmbar (EBRD,
Euratom, Bayernwerk), oder sie hatten einige bestimmte
Bedingungen fuer ihre Beteiligung gestellt, die von der
slowakischen Seite bisher nicht akzeptiert worden sind. EdF
blieb im Projekt als der einzige Teilnehmer von den vorherigen
westlichen Partnern, aber mit einer rein konsultativen Rolle
fuer technisch und finanzielle Fragen. Preussen Elektra
kuendigte seinen Rueckzug aus dem Projekt schon am Anfang von
1995 oeffentlich an, Bayernwerk im September 1995. Andere
westliche Anleger leugnen ihre Beteiligung am neuen Projekt. Auf
diese Art hat nur Siemens durch Vertraege mit SE ueber die
Lieferung von Sicherheitstechnologie fuer Mochovce als auch
ueber die Sanierung von Bohunice von der Situation profitiert.
Zur Zeit arbeiten die slowakischen Vertreter intensiv am
Abschluss von konkreten Vertraegen mit allen potentiellen
Partnern. Dies ist eine hochkomplizierte Angelegenheit, und der
Informationsfluss an die Oeffentlichkeit bleibt immer noch sehr
spaerlich. Der Minister fuer Wirtschaft hat alle offiziellen
Versuche von NGOs oder der Gruenen im slowakischen Parlament
abgelehnt, in eine oeffentliche Diskussion ueber das neue
Projekt einzusteigen. Er gab an, dass solch eine Diskussion im
Februar 1996 (mit dem Abschluss der Oeffentlichkeitsbeteiligung
durch die EBRD) beendet sei. Dies ist eine offene
Veraechtlichmachung von grunddemokratischen Regeln. Darueber
hinaus wecken die Reduzierung der Projektkosten wie auch die
potentiellen Beteiligten Befuerchtungen hinsichtlich der
kerntechnischen Sicherheit. Das Mochovce-Problem brachte eine
andere wesentliche Angelegenheit ins oeffentliche Bewusstsein:
Die Verwendung von Energiequellen und die Energiepolitik in der
Slowakei. Wie in anderen postkommunistischen Laendern produziert
die Industrie in der Slowakei immer noch mit veralteter
Technologie, mit mindestens dreimal hoeherem
Primaerenergieverbrauch gemessen am erwirtschafteten
Bruttosozialprodukt als vergleichsweise die westeuropaeischen
Laendern. Das Energiesystem wird voellig zentralisiert und
monopolisiert von der Staatsaktiengesellschaft SE. Die SE sollte
in den Privatisierungsprozess eingehen, aber die gegenwaertige
Regierung nahm sie absichtlich als ein sogenanntes
"strategisches Interesse" von diesem aus. Das Energiesystem der
Slowakei basiert auf der Leistung von grossen Atomkraftwerken,
anderen thermischen Kraftwerken und Wasserkraftwerken. Das in
Betrieb befindliche AKW Bohunice mit 2 Bloecken der WWER 440/230
Klasse und 2 Bloecken der WWER 440/213 Klasse (elektrische
Gesamtleistung 1760 MW) deckt etwa 50% der Stromproduktion im
Land. Zu derselben Zeit stellt es mit seiner veralteten
Konstruktion und den abgewirtschafteten technischen Komponenten
eine ernste Gefahr fuer Zentraleuropa dar. Trotzdem will die
slowakische Regierung seinen Betrieb ueber das Jahr 2000 hinaus
verlaengern, indem sie behauptet, dass Slowakei keine
entsprechenden Energieressourcen habe. Dieses gilt auch als
"Argument" fuer die Annahme des JEMO Projekts, ohne jegliche
vorherige Diskussion ueber die Gesamtbilanz der Optionen.
Weiterhin wird gegenwaertig das staatliche Planungspapier
"Energiepolitik der slowakischen Republik bis 2005"
ueberarbeitet, ebenfalls ohne jede oeffentliche Diskussion ueber
die Strukturen und Funktionen des Energie-Gesamtsystems. Auf
diese Art beeinflusst das Mochovce Projekt die slowakische
Energiepolitik auf eine einseitige, unausgewogene Weise
vorherbestimmend. Leider hat die starre Position den leitenden
Staatsangestellten und die Energielobby davon abgehalten, die
tatsaechliche Situation im Energiesektor objektiv zu
analysieren, (in bezug auf die Wirtschaft und die
Umweltauswirkungen), und ein klares Programm zu formulieren, wie
man ein dauerhaft stabiles Energiesystem im Land erreichen kann.
In Gegensatz dazu haben die Umweltverbaende, um die
Entscheidungstraeger zu interessieren, schon ein Grundkonzept
aufgezeigt, wie man die Energieprobleme der Slowakei loesen
kann. Das Hauptziel ist es, den Energiesektor umzustukturieren
in Richtung auf eine effiziente und langzeitvertraegliche
Betriebsweise. Die Hauptelemente solch einer Loesung sind:
Umstukturierung der Industrie (notwendig auch unter
allgemeineren oekonomischen Gesichtspunkten);
Energieersparmassnahmen im grossen Massstab;
Wirkungsgradsteigerung bei vorhandenen Kraftwerken;
Kraft-Waerme-Kopplung, Gas-und-Dampf-Kraftwerke; Erneuerbare und
Alternativenergiequellen (z.Zt. fast bedeutungslos). Manche
dieser Elemente werden von der Energiepolitik schon behandelt,
aber ohne jede konkrete Umsetzung in der Praxis. Zur gleichen
Zeit erschoepft das JEMO Projekt saemtliche finanziellen
Kapazitaeten in einem Umfang, dass fuer die notwendigen Mittel
nicht mehr bleiben, um eine angemessene Energiepolitik des
Staats finanziell zu unterstuetzen. Im Gegensatz zur
Vorgehensweise von Staat und dem Management des Energiesektors
fuehren die Umweltverbaende in ihrer Kampagne gegen das Mochovce
Projekt und fuer eine grundlegende Aenderung der Energiepolitik
fort. Sie sind davon ueberzeugt, dass nur die Energieeinsparung
sowie umweltfreundliche Energieerzeugung undnutzung die beste
Perspektive fuer die ganze slowakische Wirtschaft und Umwelt
ist. Um solch ein Modell einzufuehren, tun sie ihr bestes.

Mochovce - die Zahlen

von Patricia Lorenz, Manuela Kreuter, Paxus Calta (Global 2000)
(12. Juni 1996) - Die Vertraege zur Finanzierung von Mochovce
wurden am 30. Mai 1996 unterzeichnet. Fuenf Banken sind
uebergekommen, 701 Millionen US $ fuer den Bau der zwei
unvollendeten Atomreaktoren in Mochovce in Slowakei
bereitzustellen. Der groesste Investitionsbeitrag kam von der
Czech Komercni Banka (200 Millionen US $) und dem slowakischen
Konsortium VUB und Slovenska Sporitelna (305 Millionen US $),
wobei die Deutsche Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (86,7
Millionen US $) und die franzoesische Societe Generale (42,7
Millionen U S $), die Gelder fuer die Siemens und Framatome
Beitraege zum Projekt geben. Die tschechische Ceska Sporitelna
lieferte das restlichen 66,7 Millionen US $. Die slowakische
Regierung hat zugestimmt, fuer alle Kredite zu garantieren. In
der amateurhaften Pressemitteilung, die die Abschluesse
bekanntgibt, wurde der Gesamtwert der Bauvertraege mit 804,8
Millionen US $ angesetzt, waehrend die tatsaechliche Endsumme
der aufgelisteten Zahlen 754,6 Millionen US $ war. Vermutlich
brauchen die Russen (Unterstuetzungssum me 30 Millionen US $)
keinen Finanzierungsvertrag unterschreiben, weil sie einfach die
Summe der slowakischen Verschuldung reduzieren. Die Russen
unterschrieben eine 50 Millionen US $ werte
Darlehensvereinbarung am 23. Mai 1996 in Moskau. Diese
Investitionen decken keine Kosten ausser den 754,6 million US $
direkt entstehender Kosten (oder eventuell 804,8 Millionen US $,
wenn etwas ausgelassen wurde); es gibt einen darueber
hinausgehenden Finanzierungsbedarf von Zinsen, Kredittilgung und
Geldhandhabung, der in der Hoehe von 126,5 Millionen US $ als
notwendig anerkannt ist. Auf diese Weise sind nur 701 Millionen
US $ fuer ein 881 Millionen (oder sogar 931 Millionen) Projekt
gesichert worden. Ausserdem stehen die fast 1 Milliarden US $
von Altschulden aus dem bisherigen Bau von Mochovce bei diesem
Finanzierungsplan weiterhin offen. Der Vertrag wurde
unterschrieben, bevor die Ueberpruefung durch die Regierung
abgeschlossen war. Technisch hat die Regierung ihre eigenen
Beschlussfassungsregeln verletzt, indem sie diese Vertraege
unterschrieb, bevor das Energiekonzept fuer die Slowakei vom
Parlament ueberprueft wurde. An demselben Tag, als diese
Vertraege unterschrieben wurden, war Industrieminister Dutsky
vom Umweltausschuss des Parlamenents angewiesen worden, eine
Version des Energiekonzepts mit einem Szenario "ohne Mochovce"
zur Ueberpruefung vor zulegen. Dieses Dokument lag bis zum Datum
der Vertragsunterschrift, nicht vor. Tatsaechlich wurden die
Vorbehalte von Oppositionsparlamentariern ignorierte und nicht
korrekt im Protokoll beruecksichtigt. Greenpeace weist auf den
deutschen "Doppelten Standard" hin. In der Pressemitteilung vom
Tag der Vertragsunterschrift kritisierte Greenpeace Bratislava
die deutsche Regierung, weil diese einen unterschiedlichen
Sicherheitsstandard fuer Ost und West aufrecht erhaelt. Mit
Blick auf die Greifswald Reaktoren in der frueheren DDR (die von
derselbe Konstruktion wie Mochovce sind), erinnerte Greenpeace
die Welt daran, dass Deutschland es fuer zu unsicher hielt, die
laufenden Reaktoren weiterzubetreiben und es fuer
unwirtschaftlich befand, die 3 in unterschiedlichen Bauphasen
unvollendeten Bloecke auf deutschen Sicherheitsstandard zu
bringen. Also ist, was fuer die Sicherheit in Deutschland
verlangt ist, in der Slowakei nicht notwendig. (Fuer die volle

Keine Hermes-Buergschaften fuer unsinnige Energieprojekte.

Bonn (dpa) 02.07.1996 - Umweltorganisationen aus Deutschland,
Oesterreich und der Slowakei haben an die Bundesregierung
appelliert, keine Ausfuhrbuergschaften fuer den
Drei-Schluchten-Staudamm in China und das Atomkraftwerk Mochovce
in der Slowakei zu uebernehmen. Beide Energieprojekte seien
oekologisch und sozial unsinnig, kritisierten die deutsche WEED,
die slowakische Za Matku Zem und die oesterreichische Global
2000 am Dienstag in Bonn. Deutsche Steuergelder duerften solche
Projekte nicht mit Hilfe von Hermes-Buergschaften
subventionieren. Ausserdem forderten die drei Organisationen ein
Ende der Geheimniskraemerei bei der Entscheidung um die
Buergschaftsvergabe. Der Bundestag und die Oeffentlichkeit
muessten umfassend informiert und in die Entscheidungsfindung
einbezogen werden. Die SPD-Opposition und Buendnis 90/Die
Gruenen brachten dazu Anfragen an die Bundesregierung ein.

Pressemitteilung der Gruenen vom 2.7.1996 

Zu der anstehenden Entscheidung ueber die Hermes-Kreditvergaben
fuer den Weiterbau des slowakischen Atomkraftwerkes Mochovce
erklaert die atompolitische Sprecherin, Ursula Schoenberger: Mit
Hilfe deutscher Hermes-Kredite will Siemens mit anderen Firmen
das AKW-Mochovce in der Slowakei fertigstellen. Doch die
Unterstuetzung der Exportfaehigkeit der deutschen Wirtschaft
durch die Bundesregierung muss da enden, wo es um ein
potentielles Geschaeft mit dem Tod geht. Wir haben deshalb den
Antrag eingebracht, diese Kredite nicht zu bewilligen. Mit der
Hermes-Kreditvergabe wuerde Deutschland zudem gegen die vitalen
Interessen des EU-Partners Oesterreich verstossen. Die
oesterreichische Regierung interveniert seit Monaten gegen die
Fertigstellung des Atomkraftwerkes 180 km von Wien entfernt und
hat stattdessen vielfach Unterstuetzung fuer moderne,
nichtnukleare Kraftwerke angeboten. Mit der Bewilligung der
HermesBuergschaft wuerde Deutschland seinen EU-Nachbarn
brueskieren. Auch finanziell ist die Hermes-Buergschaft ein
unkalkulierbares Risiko. Neben dem Auftrag fuer die
Fertigstellung von Mochovce hat Siemens gleichzeitig einen
Auftrag fuer den Bau des 200-MWGaskraftwerkes "Bratislava 2"
erhalten. Die Planungen basieren auf voellig ueberhoehten
Stromverbrauchsprognosen und geschehen vor dem Hintergrund einer
Schuldenlast von 200 Millionen USDollar der slowakischen
Energiebetriebe (SE). Somit ist jetzt schon absehbar, dass die
Rueckzahlung der Kredite sehr unwahrscheinlich ist.

Oesterreichische Volkspartei in Wien kritisiert deutsche Haltung
zu.

Wien (dpa) 03.07.1996 - Als "Schlag ins Gesicht Oesterreichs"
hat die Generalsekretaerin der oesterreichischen Volkspartei
(OeVP), Maria Rauch-Kallat, die Haltung Deutschlands in der
Frage der Finanzierung des slowakischen Kernkraftwerks Mochovce
kritisiert. Es sei zu hoffen, dass die Bonner Regierung ihre
Zusage, ueber die Hermes-Kreditversicherungs Mochovce eine
Finanzierungshilfe in Hoehe von 148 Millionen Mark zu gewaehren,
noch einmal ueberdenkt, erklaerte Rauch-Kallat am Mittwoch in
Wien. "Ich appelliere daher an die deutsche Umweltministerin
Merkel, die Einwaende von acht EU-Staaten und von mehr als einer
Million BuergerInnen aus EU-Staaten, aus der Slowakei und
anderen osteuropaeischen Staaten nicht zu uebergehen", heisst es
in der Presseerklaerung der OeVP, die Juniorpartner in der
Regierung von Bundeskanzler Franz Vranitzky ist.

"Siemens verlaengert die Lebensdauer gefaehrlicher Atommeiler"

Wissenschaftler des Instituts fuer Regional-Oekonomie im
pfaelzischen Roemerberg kommen in einer Untersuchung zu dem
Ergebnis, dass der Siemens-Konzern mit der Nachruestung von
Atomkraftwerken vor allem in Osteuropa strukturell den
Weiterbetrieb von Anlagen foerdert, die ohne die Renovierung
bereits stillgelegt worden sein muessten. Aufgrund der
Materialermuedung in den zum Teil ueberalterten Atommeilern
nehme das Unternehmen eine jederzeit moegliche nukleare
Katastrophe in Kauf. Wie der Journalist Juergen Metkemeyer in
der Frankfurter Rundschau (25. 7. 96) weiter schreibt, warnen
die Wissenschaftler in ihrer Studie, Siemens versuche mit den
umsatztraechtigen Nachruestungen, die Lebensdauer der
Atomkraftwerke zu verlaengern. "Dadurch wird gerade in den
Laendern Mittel- und Osteuropas durch die Nachruestmassnahmen
die zuegige Abschaltung der alten Atomreaktoren sowjetischer
Bauart verhindert", sagte der Mitautor und Biologe Henrik
Paulitz gegenueber der FR. <a name=L10017></a><a href=#L10018>So</a> wuerden zum Beispiel verrostete
Dampferzeuger ausgetauscht, Turbinen nachgeruestet,
Prozessleitsysteme modernisiert, Diagnosesysteme
weiterentwickelt und Notkuehlsysteme hinzugefuegt. "Durch den
Austausch vor allem <a name=L10018></a><a href=#L10019>so</a> hoch belasteter Teile wie Dampferzeuger
und Rohrleitungen", <a name=L10019></a><a href=#L10020>so</a> die FR, "wollen die Ingenieure die Gefahr
des Rostfrasses in den Griff bekommen. Paulitz sieht aber gerade
darin eine grosse Gefahr: 'Dass derartige Einzelmassnahmen ein
komplexes System wie ein Atomkraftwerk mit vielen Kilometern
Rohrleitungen und sehr grossen Materialoberflaechen nicht
runderneuern koennen, liegt auf der Hand.' Somit erhoehten
solche Nachruestungen die Gefahr weiterer, schwerer
Katastrophen, weil das Atomkraftwerk nicht neu gebaut, sondern
lediglich in - wenngleich wichtigen - Teilen ausgewechselt
werde. Die uebrigen Bauteile stammten noch aus Zeiten, in denen
die Erfuellung des Plansolls Vorrang vor Sicherheit hatte.
Prominentes Beispiel fuer den neuen Geschaeftszweig der Siemens
AG ist die umstrittene slowakische Atomruine von Mochovce. (...)

der Schriftsteller Carl Amery an den Vorsitzenden der Bayernwerke

(Veroeffentlicht als Editorial in der Energiedepesche Nr. 2/96).
Sehr geehrter Herr Dr. Holzer, die Bayernwerke markierten mitten
in der allgemeinen oekonomischen Betruebnis ihren 75. Geburtstag
durch ein 'Fest der Superlative'. 1.200 Persoenlichkeiten aus
Wirtschaft und Politik, <a name=L10020></a><a href=#L10021>so</a> las man, waren geladen; 750 Helfer
dekorierten die Olympiahalle, nichts wurde versaeumt, um das
Datum jubelnd zu feiern. Ich habe 74 von den gefeierten 75
Jahren als Stromkunde zum Wohl Ihrer Firma und damit wohl auch
zur Finanzierung des Festes der Superlative beigetragen, was
mich, wie Sie sich denken koennen, mit stiller Genugtuung
erfuellt und mir das Recht gibt, Ihnen den faelligen
Glueckwunsch nachzureichen. Im Herbst 1992 fand in Salzburg ein
World Uranium Hearing statt. Auf diesem Hearing berichteten
Zeit- und Ortszeugen aus der ganzen Welt ueber die genozidalen,
und zwar permanent genozidalen Umstaende, unter denen in ihren
Heimaten die Urangewinnung stattfindet. Claus Biegert, der
Organisator des Hearings, und ich schrieben Ihnen unter dem
frischen Eindruck dieser niederschmetternden Zeugnisse;
richteten die Anfrage an Sie, wie man als Atom-Wirtschaftler,
Atom-Politiker, Atom-Profiteur mit diesem Wissen zu leben
vermag. Sie haben uns tatsaechlich geantwortet. Und der erste
entscheidende Satz Ihres Antwortschreibens verdient woertlich
zitiert zu werden: "Der von Ihnen aufgestellten These, dass ein
Uranabbau generell nicht ohne verheerende Effekte von Genozid
beziehungsweise Ethnozid moeglich sei, muss ich allerdings klar
widersprechen. Heute sind nach meiner Kenntnis in den fuer uns
wichtigen Uranfoerderlaendern strenge gesetzliche Regelungen und
Standards fuer den Gesundheitsschutz und den Umweltschutz beim
Abbau von Uran festgeschrieben." Sie werden verstehen, dass uns
die Dreistigkeit dieser Antwort zunaechst einfach die Sprache
verschlug. (...) Aber offensichtlich haben Sie, sehr geehrter
Herr Dr. Holzer, Ihrem eigenen Argument doch nicht ganz getraut
und auf Seite zwei Ihres Antwortschreibens ein gaenzlich
anderes, dem ersten diametral widersprechendes angefuehrt:
"Notwendig fuer die vergleichende Beurteilung der heute zur
Verfuegung stehenden Energietraeger muss eine Gesamtbetrachtung
sein, welche die Umweltauswirkungen der Gewinnung und des
Einsatzes auch aller anderen Energietraeger in die Abwaegung
einbezieht. Eine Einstellung des Uranabbaus wuerde die weitere
Nutzung der Kernenergie unmoeglich machen und zwangslaeufig zu
einem verstaerkten Einsatz fossiler Energietraeger fuehren,
damit aber unter anderem zu einer weltweiten Erhoehung der
CO2-Emmissionen mit ihren Folgen fuer das globale Klima
beitragen..." Es gibt also irgendwelche Umweltauswirkungen des
Uranabbaus; sonst haette das Argument ueberhaupt kein Gewicht.
Aber zum Wohle der zivilisierten Menschheit, die unbedingt ihre
Mega- und Terawatt braucht, muessen eben ein paar Kanaken dran
glauben. Sie sollen froh sein, dass sie nicht an CO2-Emissionen
eingehen, sondern an Yellow-Cake-Strahlung - und prozentual,
aufs globale Ganze gesehen, weil wir sonst zwangslaeufig den
Globus mit den Schadstoffen aus fossilen Energietraegern
vergiften muessten. Ergo: ein paar tote Eskimos und Navajos sind
das kleinere Uebel, das stellvertretende Menschenopfer. (...)
Aber der Wurm, verehrter Dr. Holzer, der Wurm steckt im Adverb
zwangslaeufig. Zwangslaeufig - das erinnert mich aufs Fatalste
an das Schlagwort von den Sachzwaengen - ein Schlagwort, das
fuer die Aera Helmut Schmidt bezeichnend war. In Wahrheit gibt
es keine Sachzwaenge ausser denen, die uns von den
thermodynamischen und den Entropiegesetzen auferlegt werden und
die laufen genau in die Gegenrichtung von dem, was Sie und
tausend andere Technokraten und die grosse Mehrheit aller
Politiker uns verkaufen wollen. Es gibt zum Beispiel keinen
Sachzwang, der die Bundesrepublik daran hindern wuerde, zwei
Prozent der ungeheuren Vermoegenswerte, die in deutschen Banken
liegen (viertausend Milliarden, ohne Immobilienwerte) fuer
Zwecke des Gemeinwohls zu sequestrieren und mit diesen achtzig
Milliarden den Energiebedarf der Nation ein fuer allemal aus
einem Mix regenerierbarer, das heisst letzten Endes solarer
Energie zu stabilisieren. Die Auswirkungen auf den Arbeitsmarkt
waeren phaenomenal, die Aussenhandelsbilanz saehe praechtig aus-
und der Rest der Welt waere endlich gezwungen, den Tatsachen ins
Auge zu sehen. Natuerlich, ich gebe Ihnen recht, verehrter Dr.
Holzer, das wird nicht geschehen. Es wird aber nicht deshalb
unterbleiben, weil ein Sachzwang dagegen vorliegt. (...) In
einem Interview haben Sie auf die Frage, ob Sie persoenlich
etwas gegen alternative Energie haetten, sinngemaess
geantwortet, Sie haetten nichts dagegen - es duerften nur keine
Ueberkapazitaeten entstehen. Ueberkapazitaeten. Das ist das
Stichwort. Alternative Energien duerfen einfach nicht die Chance
bekommen, auf nennenswerte Weise in den grossen Strommarkt
einzudringen - der muss Ihnen und Ihresgleichen vorbehalten
bleiben. Fuer uns, die Alternativen, stellt sich das Problem
grundsaetzlich gegenteilig. Fuer uns sind etwa Atomkraftwerke
Ueberkapazitaeten, die nach Tschernobyl nicht nur <a name=L10021></a><a href=#L10022>so</a>
ueberfluessig, sondern <a name=L10022></a><a href=#L10023>so</a> gefaehrlich wie ein Gehirntumor sind.
Fuer uns fuehrt der Weg in die Zukunft nur ueber regenerative
Energie, gleichzeitig aber ueber eine Effizienz- und
Suffizienz-Revolution, welche den Energiebedarf mittelfristig
schon dann halbieren kann, wenn wir unseren Kulturentwurf nicht
wesentlich veraendern. Dieser Weg fuehrt zwangslaeufig zu einer
Demokratisierung der Energie, und die ist natuerlich
geschaeftlich inakzeptabel, das ist einzusehen. Mit freundlichen
Gruessen  Carl Amery

Ukraine

Bank will Projekte fuer Atomkraftwerke in der Ukraine
ueberpruefen

Sofia (dpa), 16.04.1996 - Die Europaeische Bank fuer
Wiederaufbau und Entwicklung (EBWE/London) will ihre Projekte
fuer den Ausbau von Atomkraftwerken in Mittel- und Osteuropa,
einschliesslich der Finanzierung von zwei Atomreaktoren in der
Ukraine, kritisch ueberpruefen. Das sagten Vertreter von
Nichtregierungsorganisationen am Dienstag vor der Presse in
Sofia am Rande der Jahrestagung der Osteuropabank. Der
Praesident der Osteuropabank, Jacques de Larosiere, habe bei
einem Treffen mit Nichtregierungsorganisationen und
Umweltschuetzern aus sechs Staaten in Sofia zugesagt, die EBWE
werde eine neue Studie ueber die Projekte zum weiteren Ausbau
der ukrainischen Atomwirtschaft anfertigen lassen. Mitglieder
des Gouverneursrats der EBWE haetten zugegeben, die vorhandene
Studie ueber die Errichtung von zwei Atomreaktoren in der
Ukraine - Khmelnitski II und Rovno IV - sei "fehlerhaft". Die
Fertigstellung der neuen Studie wird nach Angaben von
Umweltschuetzern bis zu einem Jahr beanspruchen. Bei der
Bewilligung neuer Projekte zur Finanzierung von Atomkraftwerken
werde die Osteuropabank vier Kriterien beruecksichtigen,
sicherte de Larosiere zu. Niedrigere Kosten, hoechste
Sicherheit, Moeglichkeit zur Tilgung des Kredits und sichere
Bedienungsprozedur seien die Voraussetzungen, von denen die EBWE
in Zukunft die Finanzierung neuer Projekte abhaengig machen wird.

Der Moskauer Gipfel im April 1996 - Eine Nachlese

Moskauer Gipfel fordert weltweiten Atomteststopp bis September

Moskau (dpa), 21.04.1996 - Russland und der Westen haben bei
ihrem Moskauer Gipfeltreffen dazu aufgerufen, bis zum September
einen weltweiten Atomteststopp zu beschliessen. Zum zehnten
Jahrestag der Katastrophe von Tschernobyl bekraeftigten die
fuehrenden Industrienationen (G-7), Russland und die Ukraine am
Samstag die Absicht, das Kernkraftwerk bis zum Jahr 2000 zu
schliessen. Die Teilnehmer vereinbarten auch Massnahmen gegen
den illegalen Handel mit Atommaterial. Sie verabschiedeten
insgesamt vier Erklaerungen fuer mehr Atomsicherheit.
Gleichzeitig riefen die Staaten in einer gemeinsamen Erklaerung
zu einem Waffenstillstand im Nahen Osten auf. Zu der Forderung
nach einem Atomteststopp sagte US-Praesident Bill Clinton:
"Durch die Fortschritte hier in Moskau sind wir diesem Ziel <a name=L10023></a><a href=#L10024>so</a>
nah wie nie seit Beginn des Atomzeitalters." Clinton zeigte sich
zuversichtlich, dass der Vertrag im September bei den Vereinten
Nationen unterzeichnet werden koenne. "Die Schritte, die wir
heute hier beschlossen haben, werden nicht nur die USA, sondern
die ganze Welt sicherer machen." "Die Partnerschaft zwischen
drei grossen politischen Maechten - USA, Europa und Russland hat
ein neues Niveau erreicht", sagte der franzoesische
Staatspraesident Jacques Chirac zum Abschluss der Konferenz, die
er gemeinsam mit Jelzin leitete. Jelzin zeigte sich jedoch
unzufrieden, dass keine Entscheidung ueber eine Erweiterung der
G-7 durch Russland zu einer G-8 getroffen wurde. "Nicht alle
sind der Ansicht, dass Russland Teil des Klubs sein sollte." Als
einen Meilenstein bezeichnete Bundeskanzler Helmut Kohl den
Aufruf zum Verbot von Nuklearversuchen. Die G-7 bat Jelzin, sich
bei seinem Besuch in der kommenden Woche in China fuer einen
Atomteststopp einzusetzen. Mit Peking gebe es in dieser Frage
aber Schwierigkeiten, meinte Jelzin. Die
Umweltschutzorganisation Greenpeace begruesste den Schritt zu
einem Atomteststopp als "wichtigen Durchbruch fuer die
Verhandlungen in Genf". Ein wichtiges Thema der Beratungen sei
der Kampf gegen den illegalen Handel mit Atommaterial gewesen,
sagte Clinton. Es seien Massnahmen vereinbart worden, "damit
Nuklearmaterial nicht in falsche Haende kommt". Er fuegte hinzu:
"Heute haben wir beschlossen, enger als jemals zuvor
zusammenzuarbeiten, um das zu verhindern." Die Gipfelteilnehmer
verabschiedeten auch eine Deklaration ueber nukleare Sicherheit.
Wie es hiess, sollen noch 1996 Experten bei einer Konferenz in
Frankreich eroertern, wie waffentaugliches Plutonium entsorgt
und gesichert werden kann. Nach Angaben des Kremls sprachen sich
die Gipfelteilnehmer auch fuer die Ausweitung atomwaffenfreier
Zonen aus. Westliche Delegationskreise bestaetigten das nicht.
"Das Gipfeltreffen bedeutet eine neue Qualitaet der Kooperation
zwischen Ost und West", sagte Jelzin. Die Teilnehmerstaaten des
Moskauer Gipfeltreffens verfuegten ueber 80 Prozent der
Kernreaktoren in der Welt. Diese Staaten haetten auch eine
besondere Verantwortung fuer die Sicherheit dieser
Kernkraftwerke. Neue Nuklearanlagen muessten durch
internationale Zusammenarbeit entwickelt werden. Nach Angaben
Kohls sagte Jelzin zu, Russland wolle noch in diesem Jahr dem
verschaerften Londoner Abkommen von 1993 beitreten, das die
Verklappung von Atommuell und radioaktiven Stoffen im Meer
verbietet. Zur Sicherheit der zivilen Atomanlagen in Russland
sagte Clinton: "Sie bewegen sich in die richtige Richtung.
Russland ist nicht das einzige Land mit solchen Problemen."
Jelzin meinte: "In den vergangenen vier Jahren hat Russland
einen grossen Schritt vorwaerts zur Sicherheit der
Atomkraftwerke gemacht." Mehr als die Haelfte der 29 in Russland
betriebenen Reaktoren aehneln dem Tschernobyl-Typ. Die
Gipfelteilnehmer bekraeftigen in einer Erklaerung den Willen,
das Atomkraftwerk Tschernobyl entsprechend den Vereinbarungen
mit der Ukraine bis zum Jahr 2000 stillzulegen. Ueber die
Finanzierung dieser Absicht enthaelt das Dokument keine neuen
Zusagen. Die Ukraine fordert zusaetzlich zu der bereits
zugesagten Finanzhilfe von 2,3 Milliarden Dollar (3,45 Mrd.
Mark) fuer die Schliessung Tschernobyls weitere Unterstuetzung
fuer eine neue Betonhuelle um den Ungluecksreaktor.

Neuer Streit zwischen Ukraine und G-7 um Tschernobyl

Kiew 07.06.1996 (dpa) - Bei den Verhandlungen zwischen der
Ukraine und der Gruppe der sieben fuehrenden Industrienationen
(G-7) ueber die Stillegung des Kernkraftwerks Tschernobyl ist
neuer Streit entbrannt. Der ukrainische Umweltminister Juri
Kostenko drohte am Donnerstag in Kiew mit einem Ausstieg aus dem
Programm, weil sich beide Seiten nicht ueber den
Finanzierungsbeginn der Fertigstellung von zwei Ersatzreaktoren
einigen konnten. "Wenn keine annehmbare Entscheidung gefunden
wird, koennte die ukrainische Regierung genoetigt sein, die
Etappen der Verwirklichung des Tschernobyl-Programms zu
ueberpruefen", erklaerte Kostenko. Der Westen und die Ukraine
hatten sich im Dezember 1995 grundsaetzlich auf eine Schliessung
von Tschernobyl bis zum Jahre 2000 geeinigt. Beide Seiten hatten
am Dienstag die Verhandlungen zu Detailfragen fortgesetzt. Die
Gesamtkosten des Programms werden auf 3,1 Milliarden US-Dollar
veranschlagt. Dazu gehoert die Fertigstellung von zwei im Bau
befindlichen Reaktoren an den Standorten Rowno und Chmelnizki.
Die Ukraine forderte die sofortige Zuteilung von Finanzhilfen.
Dagegen sagte der Unterhaendler der G-7, Generaldirektor Claude
Mandil vom franzoesischen Industrieministerium, die Gelder
koennten fruehestens Mitte 1997 gegeben werden. "Wir brauchen
erst Beweise, dass das Projekt gut ist unter technologischen und
oekologischen Gesichtspunkten", sagte er nach Angaben der
Agentur Interfax. Ein Abkommen ueber die Finanzierung des Baus
eines Zwischenlagers fuer ausgebrannte Kernbrennelemente soll
dagegen bereits im Juli unterzeichnet werden. Fortschritte gab
es auch bei der Frage der unsicheren Betonhuelle um den
zerstoerten vierten Reaktor. Bis zum September soll ein Entwurf
fuer eine weitere Schutzhuelle einschliesslich eines Finanzplans
fuer deren Bau erstellt werden.

"Kernenergie aus dem Bereich des politischen Hick-Hack
herausholen"

Am atomrechtlichen Eroerterungstermin fuer das Atommuellager
Lubmin hat in der vergangenen Woche auch der Berliner Physiker
und Politiker Sebastian Pflugbeil (49) auf Seiten der Einwender
teilgenommen. Der Wissenschaftler hatte 1990 als Umweltminister
der Modrow-Regierung wegen gravierender Sicherheitsmaengel die
Abschaltung des Atomkraftwerkes "Bruno Leuschner" erwirkt.
Pflugbeil, der bis zur Wende 1989 als Physiker bei der Akademie
der Wissenschaften gearbeitet hat, verfasste im Auftrag des
DDR-Kirchenbundes u. a. die Studie "Energie und Umwelt". Bis
1995 war Pflugbeil fuer das NEUE FORUM Vertreter im Berliner
Abgeordnetenhaus. Seit 1986 engagiert sich Familie Pflugbeil
stark fuer Betroffene des Reaktorunfalls von Tschernobyl.
Derzeit wird unter ihrer Leitung im weissrussischen verstrahlten
Gebiet um Gomel ein GUS-weit einzigartiges
Rehabilitationszentrum fuer strahlenkranke Kinder errichtet. Mit
Sebastian Pflugbeil sprach Thomas Jeutner.

(...) DIE KIRCHE: Vor drei Monaten wurden 235 hochradioaktive
Lubminer Brennstaebe nach Paks in Ungarn verschenkt. Mit
Lubminer Brennstoff - im Wert von 40 Millionen Mark - wird nun
ein ungarisches Kernkraftwerk, das in Deutschland nicht mehr
genehmigungsfaehig waere, weiterbetrieben. Was steht dahinter?

PFLUGBEIL: Die deutsche Atomindustrie kaempft nach Harrisburgh
und Tschernobyl verzweifelt um Auftraege. Neubauten in
Deutschland oder Osteuropa stehen nicht mehr zur Diskussion. Was
bleibt, sind kleinere Auftraege, wie Nachruestungen der Ost-KKW.
Hier liegt der Grund fuer die eigenartige heutige Position der
Bundesumweltministerin zum KKW Greifswald. Es macht natuerlich
keinen guten Eindruck, wenn wir einerseits acht Reaktoren in
Greifswald stillegen, weil sie fuer uns selbst zu gefaehrlich
sind, andererseits aber Nachruestungsauftraege bei unsern
oestlichen Nachbarn an genau diesem KKW-Typ ausfuehren, um
wenigstens ein kleines Geschaeft zu machen, wohl wissend, dass
entscheidende Schwachpunkte nicht nachgebessert werden koennen.
Es ist menschenverachtend, wenn aus Deutsch-land durch das
Liefern von Brennelementen oder Ersatzteilen und durch
Nachruestungen unterstuetzt wird, dass Reaktoren weiterlaufen,
die wir in Deutschland als zu gefaehrlich stillegen. Es ist
darueber hinaus rechtlich und moralisch unvertretbar, dass
Deutschland unter dem Mantel der Nachbarschaftshilfe benutzte
deutsche Brennelemente nach Osteuropa liefert und sich damit
seiner Verpflichtung entzieht, den eigenen Muell sicher im Lande
zu verwahren.

DIE KIRCHE: Zum 10. Mal wird des Unfalls von Tschernobyl
gedacht. Sie haben an mehreren ost- und westeuropaeischen
Tagungen teilgenommen. Was ist ihr Gesamteindruck?

PFLUGBEIL: Die internationale Atomlobby hat mit einigen Erfolg
versucht, die Aufmerksamkeit der Oeffentlichkeit zum Thema
Tschernobyl durch eine Reihe grossangelegter Konferenzen zu
beeinflussen. Die Konferenzen wurden von der WHO, der
Europaeischen Kommission und der Internationalen
AtomenergieAgentur in Wien veranstaltet. Der Tenor war einhellig
<a name=L10024></a><a href=#L10025>so</a>: Man musste zugestehen, dass es nach 1986 haeufiger
Schilddruesenkrebs gibt - der sei ja aber operabel, also nicht
weiter schlimm. Es gaebe aber keine Zunahme von Leukaemie.
Daraus koenne man schliessen, dass es auch keine Zunahme von
anderen Erkrankungen nach Tschernobyl gaebe und man wisse daher
auch, dass es auch kuenftig keine Zunahme von Krankheiten geben
wird, die auf Tschernobyl zurueckgehen. Die Realitaet in den
Krankenhaeusern und in den Familien der betroffenen Regionen
sieht ganz anders aus. Viel realistischer sind auch die
offiziellen Analysen der zustaendigen Ministerien und
Parlamente. Im Nationalen Report Belorussland vom Januar `96
kann man etwa finden, dass Leukaemie bei Kindern, die in
belasteten Gebieten leben, signifikant angestiegen ist und dass
die Leukaemie bei Liquidatoren doppelt <a name=L10025></a><a href=#L10026>so</a> hoch ist wie bei
gleichaltrigen Buergern Belorusslands. Es wurde also gebogen und
gelogen, um das geschaeftsschaedigende Thema Tschernobyl
endgueltig vom Hals zu bekommen.

DIE KIRCHE: Wie geht die Bevoelkerung der verstrahlten Regionen
damit um?

PFLUGBEIL: Die einfachen Menschen und auch die Aerzte dort
brauchen keine Statistik, um zu wissen, wie sich ihr Leben durch
Tschernobyl veraendert hat. Sie wissen, dass sie belogen wurden
und werden. Sie merken, wenn sie erkranken und haben weder Zeit
noch Mittel, um eine eigene Statistik aufzustellen. Die Menschen
sind <a name=L10026></a><a href=#L10027>so</a> gepruegelt durch das zusammengebrochene sowjetische
System, dass die Probleme von Tschernobyl einfach in die dritte
Reihe geschoben werden. Die Grossbetriebe gehenkaputt,
Arbeitslosigkeit steigt steil an. Es ist schon schwierig genug,
die Kartoffeln fuer den naechsten Tag zu bezahlen. Die Frage, ob
die, die man dann findet oder selbst anbaut, verstrahlt sind
oder nicht, stellt sich unter diesen Bedingungen nicht. Das ist
leider der Alltag.

DIE KIRCHE: Das Tschernobyl-Gedenken hat Glieder der
Kirchengemeinde Pasewalk bewogen, in einem Aufruf fuer den
voelligen Ausstieg aus der Atomenergie einzutreten. Solche
Beschluesse kamen auch aus der Landessynode von
Berlin-Brandenburg und aus der Magdeburger Kirchenleitung.

PFLUGBEIL: Ich habe mich sehr darueber gefreut. Denn ich hatte
mich nach der Katastrophe von Tschernobyl darum bemueht, in den
Kirchen und ihrem Umfeld eine kritische Haltung gegenueber
jeglicher Nutzung der Kernenergie zu vermitteln. In diesem
Zusammenhang entstand die Studie "Energie und Umwelt", die der
Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen herausgab. Es gab auch damals
Synodenaeusserungen und auch eine hart erstrittene, aber
unmissverstaendliche Position der Oekumenischen Versammlung
gegen Kernenergienutzung. Dass dies jetzt wieder aufgegriffen
wird, traegt dazu bei, das Thema Kernenergie aus dem Bereich des
politischen Hick-Hack herauszuholen und sachlich zu ueberdenken.

Tschernobyl-Eins wird am 30. November abgeschaltet: Kiew (dpa,
24.06.1996) - Der erste Reaktorblock des Kernkraftwerks
Tschernobyl in der Ukraine soll am 30. November abgeschaltet
werden. Dann werde er acht oder neun Monate lang gruendlich
untersucht und auf die endgueltige Stillegung vorbereitet,
teilte die Pressestelle des Werks am Montag in Kiew mit. Die
Ukraine und der Westen haben eine endgueltige Stillegung von
Tschernobyl bis zum Jahr 2000 vereinbart. Dafuer soll Kiew 3,1
Milliarden US-Dollar Finanzhilfen erhalten. In Tschernobyl gab
es vier Reaktoren des als unsicher eingestuften sowjetischen
Bautyps RBMK. Im vierten Block ereignete sich am 26. April 1986
mit einer Explosion das schwerste Unglueck in der zivilen
Nutzung der Kernenergie. Der zweite Block liegt seit einem Brand
1991 still. Die technische Betriebsdauer des ersten
Reaktorblocks ist abgelaufen. Der im Herbst 1995 ueberholte
dritte Reaktor kann theoretisch noch mehrere Jahre lang Strom
liefern.

Schwarzes Meer wird zum Abwasserbecken

Auf einer Konferenz, die vom Europarat und vom
Schwarzmeer-Kooperationsrat nach Istanbul einberufen worden war,
haben internationale Experten die ruecksichtslose Verschmutzung
des Schwarzen Meeres angeprangert. Sie verlangten laut einer
afp-Meldung in der Frankfurter Rundschau (23.7.96) dringend
Massnahmen zur Rettung des Meeres, in das Giftstoffe und Muell
vor allem ueber die Donau und den Dnjepr gelangten. Die Fluesse
transportierten die Abwaesser von 17 europaeischen Laendern ins
Schwarze Meer. Die rund 170 Konferenzteilnehmer forderten die
Schaffung eines Forums, das Strategien zur Bekaempfung der
Verschmutzung ausarbeiten soll. Die massive Verschmutzung fuehre
zu einer dramatischen Reduzierung des Fischbestandes. Der
Jahresfischfang soll zwischen 1986 und 1991 von 900.000 auf
100.000 t zurueckgegangen sein. Ein rumaenischer Experte listete
die Giftstoffe auf, die pro Jahr allein ueber die Donau ins
Schwarze Meer gelangen: 1000 t Chrom, 40.000 t Phosphor, 500.000
t Stickstoff, 900.000 t Kupfer, 60 t Quecksilber, 4500 t Blei
und 50.000 t Oel.

ALBANIEN

Albanian civil Society Foundation

(by Steven Sampson) Albania has about 350 NGOs. The First
Albanian NGOs were started in 1991 most of the Albanian NGOs are
weak, as they lack essential resources, have inadequate
coordination among each other and weak links to the
international NGO community. NGOs and the government are unaware
of how to work with each other (or unwilling), and the image of
Albanian NGOs in the public is weak and not always positive. The
Albanian Civil Society Foundation (ACSF) has been established in
order to improve this situation. Located in Tirana and with a
five-member staff, the ACSF has been operating since March 1995.
Funding comes from a 1 million dollar grant from the Danish
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Danida) to last until the end of
1997. The goal of the ACSF is to strengthen the development of
civil society in Albania, mainly through support to Albanian
NGOs through training and project grants. ACSF is furthermore
providing information to Albanian NGOs, between NGOs and the
government, and especially to link Albanian NGOs with foreign
counterparts and donors. The ACSF is the only foundation in
Albania providing support to the full spectrum of Albanian NGOs.
ACSF has the following programs:

Grant Making to NGOs: The ACSF has disbursed about 80 grants to
Albanian NGOs in all sectors (including environment, women,
youth, human rights, ethnic minority, agricultural development,
business/commerce, civic education, social service). In granting
activities, the ACSF collaborates closely with other NGO support
programs, including UNDP, the Soros Foundation, ORT Democracy
Network Program and the Albanian NGO Forum.

Training Activities: The ACSF also conducts and funds training
courses for Albanian NGO on a wide range of topics such as
fund-raising, management issues, media relations, government
relations, etc. The ACSF has commissioned a survey (in
collaboration with the Washington based International Center for
Non-Profit Law) of the legal framework of Albanian NGOs. This
will lead to a range of seminars and handbooks on legal issues.

A Citizens Center: A major activity for the foundation in 1996
is the newly created "Citizens Center" in which Albanian NGO
members and individuals can meet, get information, arrange
courses, receive phone calls, faxes, mail, and (hopefully by
June 1996) e-mail, make photocopies, and utilize the computer
equipment.

Information Services: A part of the Albanian Civil Society
Foundation is an Information Office that shall facilitate
linkages between Albanian NGOs and their potential partners,
such as donors, foreign visitors, agencies seeking contacts with
an Albanian NGO, other Albanian NGOs, Government authorities,
the general public, etc. The Albanian Civil Society Foundation
publishes a quarterly Newsletters in Albanian and English, and
publishes the first comprehensive, frequently updated Guide to
Albanian Non-Governmental Organisations.

Organization: The Albanian Civil Society Foundation is
registered as an Albanian NGO and is governed by a nine-member
board, eight of whom are Albanians. Board meetings are held
about every 6 weeks. The staff is headed by executive Director
Rolanda Dhimitri. The Information Officer is Elvis Toci. The
ACSF's budget derives from the Danish Government aid to Albania.
It is planned that the foundation can become self-sustaining.

BALLERINA Workshop For Baltic Sea Environmental Cooperation

Stockholm - The first BALLERINA (BALtic Sea Region On-line
Environmental Information Resources for INternet Access)
workshop brought together about 65 representatives of a wide
variety of government, academic, and non-government
organizations from the Baltic Sea region to Swedish
Environmental Protection Agency headquarters on June 13-14 to
discuss the development of an Internet-based environmental
network in the region. Participants at the workshop expressed
unanimous support for the BALLERINA initiative. The aim of the
workshop was to discuss and provide guidelines on how to make
the BALLERINA initiative the gateway for environmental
information on the Baltic Sea region on the Internet through the
use of a series of World Wide Web pages with a coordinating
function of the many existing information sources now available
about the environment in the Baltic Sea region. A representative
from the Great Lakes Commission, Carol Cratza, presented the
experience of the Great Lakes Information Network (GLIN). The
BALLERINA initiative will be able to draw on the example of GLIN
as a successful electronic network concerning the environmental
issues of international waterbodies. An ad hoc committee was
designated and approved by the workshop for further organization
and realization of the BALLERINA initiative. A first general
assembly of BALLERINA participants is now planned for early 1997.

Kurzmeldungen: (Ecodefense; Infobalt; X-USSR Nuke News)

Baltic State Leaders have sverely criticized a proposed
agreement between Russia and the United States 

for Russians to station 600 armored vehicles in the Pskov region
at Russia's border with Estonia and Latvia, in place of the 180
vehicles there at present. The desire of Russia to increase its
forces in this area is considered to be a counter measure to
NATO expansion. Russia, as a result of the proposed agreement,
would be allowed to station arms at its boundaries with the
Baltic and Nordic states in 5 times higher numbers than the
conventional arms agreements allow. (ELTA)

Baltic Sea States Adopt Cooperation Programme:

(Kalmar) - The foreign ministers of the Baltic Sea states on
Wednesday adopted an action programme to boost regional
cooperation in crime-fighting, the economy, the environment and
nuclear safety. The 11 foreign ministers, representing nine
states around the Baltic Sea plus Norway and Iceland, hammered
out the details of the 17-page document on Tuesday evening and
Wednesday morning. Several investments in the region are
planned, including road and railway maintenance and harbour
developments, totalling 40 billion kronor ($6,01 billion) for
the 1995-1999 repiod. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and
Russia will receive assistance in cleaning up the environment,
particularly with regard to treating toxic waste.

Russia-Baltics-Poland - The Highway Project "Via Hanseatic"
between St.Petersburg and Gdansk,

which would link several former Hanseatic cities, is to be
supported by funds from the European Union. More than 900
million ECU are expected to be invested in project before 1999.
This project would complement "Via Baltica", which is to lead
between Helsinki, Tallinn, and Warsaw. (Vecher. Peterburg)

Estonian Ministries Of Finance And Transport And Communication

have publicly disagreed on a highway project to connect Tallinn,
through Tartu and Voru, with the existing St. Petersburg-Kiev
Highway. Ministry of Transport representative Lembit Kiviloo
stated that the project is without perspective for Estonia. The
Via Russica project would include upgrading the existing
Tallinn-Tartu road into a highway, connecting Tartu with Voru
via Petseri (Pechora), and renovating the railway link from
Valga to Pihkva (Pskov). Southeastern Estonia would in this way
become a transit point from Russia to Scandinavia. The Ministry
of Transport representative believes that the development of
railways should be the sole main priority, as today only five
percent of cargo traffic goes by highway. (ETA, 26 Apr.)

Latvia Spent Significntly Less Last Year On Environmental
Protection 

than in the previous year, according to the Central Statistical
Bureau of Latvia. About 36 million U.S. dollars were spent on
environmental protection and the rational utilization of natural
resources in Latvia in 1995, which represents a decrease of 45
percent in comparison with 1994, according to the Statistical
Bureau. (LETA)

Construction Of A New Hydro Electric Power Plant

on the Daugava River in the vicinity of Daugavpils is under
consideration. Scientists from the Latvian Environmental
Protection center, members of the organization Daugavas Loki,
and local farmers are all opposed to the project. They argue
that environmental damage will exceed any economic advantage
gained from the new power plant. Local government and business
interests are in favor of the construction to provide relatively
inexpensive electric power and to create new job opportunities
in the region. (LETA, 14 May)

ECAT-Riga officially closed his office on 1st June 1996 but
there are still some westerners 

working in the Latvian Environmental Consulting and Monitoring
Centre (ECMC) which is the successor of ECAT-Riga. The European
Union funding for ECAT-Riga has run out and the Latvian staff of
the ECMC is paid by the Latvian state. The ECMC is subordinated
to the Latvian Ministry for Environmental Protection and
Regional Development. Although there will be in the future a new
ECAT-Riga-office which will be responsible for environmental
projects which are financed by foreign institutions the old

A nuclear Fuel Storage Facility is planned at the Ignalina power
plant 

and will be financed by Ontario Hydro Company together with
tenders from Canadian AECL and German GNB companies. Spent
nuclear fuel in Ignalina is stored today in underwater
reservoirs situated under the plant reactors. The reservoirs
will soon be full. (ELTA)

Lithuania's Ignalina nuclear Power Plant,

the home of two Chernobyl-type reactors, remains a major source
of concern to the Baltic state's Nordic neighbors, stated one
Scandinavian diplomat in Vilnius. "There is a general level of
concern in the Nordic countries about the possibility of an
accident at Ignalina," he said. Ignalina supplies about 80
percent of Lithuania's electricity, making Lithuania the most
nuclear-power dependent country in the world. Four reactors were
originally planned for Ignalina, but construction on the third
was halted in 1987 by massive public protests in the wake of the
Chernobyl disaster.

Police In Lithuania Have Seized Ten Kg Of Caesium-133

and arrested two men who were trying to sell it, the country's
prosecutor's office said. Lithuania and Baltic neighbors Latvia
and Estonia are suspected of being key gateways for the
smuggling to the West of radioactive and rare metals pilfered
from the former Soviet bloc. Caesium can be produced as a deadly
by-product of nuclear fission but the prosecutor's office said
the caesium-133 variety is not radioactive. It is, however, very
poisonous. The two men were arrested in Kaunas after they tried
to sell the metal, a prosecution statement said.

A $ 6.7 million loan from the Nordic Investment Bank for
Lithuania shall help finance 

the construction of the Via Baltica trans-European highway.
Lithuanian deputy communication minister Algirdas Sakalys told
Interfax that final results were expected from loan talks by
Tuesday. Lithuania is planning to build 100-km of the highway by
the year 2000 for $60 million.

The Lithuanian Parliament has ratified the Berne Convention, the
European Agreement on Wild Nature 

and Natural Environment Protection. Lithuanian Minister of the
Environment Bronius Bradauskas said ratification of this
document was a significant step for Lithuania in its integration
into European Union environmental structures. The Berne
Convention came into force on July 1, 1982. It has been signed
by 31 European states and is an important international
agreement for the preservation of nature, wild vegetation, and
rare animals. (ELTA)

The Environmental Threat to the Lithuanian forests is serious
today, but not catastrophic, 

said Forestry Minister Albertas Vasiliauskas at a news
conference. Up to 3,000-3,200 cubic meters of wood have been
felled annually in Lithuania's forests since 1961, whereas the
maximum possible output could reach 5,000 cubic meters without a
harm to the forest resources, he said. A 1.5-fold increase in
wood production, followed by its export, is expected over the
course of the next five years. He described new plans to build a
new modern pulp mill in Lithuania to produce about 300 thousand
tons of pulp per year, which would satisfy Lithuania's own
demand and allow exports of about 100 thousand tons. (ELTA)


Lukashenka calls For Nuclear-Free Zone

(aus: X-USSR Nuke News) Minsk - The president of Belarus on
Wednesday said the nations of central and eastern Europe should
be kept free of nuclear weapons. Belarus inherited part of
Moscow's nuclear arsenal after 1991 Soviet collapse, along mwith
Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Belarus promised to disarm by
the end of 1996. "I propose that the former socialist countries
of eastern Europe, Belarus, Ukraine and the Baltic countries
should set up a nuclear free zone," President Alexander
Lukashenka said. But he added that "a unilateral step toward
nuclear disarmament is not enough" and expressed concern about
NATO's eastward expansion.

Bulgarien

Eu and Bulgaria sign agreement On nuclear power plant

(Based on Commission Press Release IP/96/431 of 5/21/1996)
Following a signed agreement between the European Commission and
the government of Bulgaria, Unit 1 of Kozloduy Nuclear Power
Plant was shut down for safety tests on 15 May 1996. Last
winter, concern was expressed when Unit 1 was restarted by the
Bulgarian government despite advice from EU experts that tests
were needed to ensure that the reactor was safe. If the present
tests show that the safety of Unit 1 needs to be improved, the
necessary work will be carried out. The decision on whether to
restart Unit 1 will be taken on the basis of common agreement
between the main designer and Bulgarian and EU experts. The
Commission will provide assistance from the PHARE technical
assistance programme for the Central and East European countries
for the tests and for helping with alternative energy supplies
for winter 1996/1997. The Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant generates
around 40% of Bulgaria's electricity. The power plant has six
nuclear reactors, of which Units 1 to 4 are of the oldest type
of Soviet-designed pressurized water reactors. Units 5 and 6 on
the other hand are the most modern type of Soviet nuclear
reactors. In 1994 European experts expressed the opinion that
the reactor pressure vessel (the reinforced container within
which the nuclear reactions take place) of Kozloduy Unit 1 had
to be tested to assess its safety. The Commission has been
working closely with the Bulgarian government to ensure that
until these reactors are permanently closed they are operated in
the safest possible conditions.

Sergiu Fandofan on Ecological Problems in Moldova

(Sergiu Fandofan is General Director of the Department on the
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of the Republic
of Moldova) - First of all it refers to the water resources
preservation and water use problem. The problem of water supply
for the population, especially in the southern regions of the
country, is closely connected with the health of the nation. We
even had to appeal to the foreign experts and international
organizations for help. The latter, by the way, expressed their
willingness to assist to Moldova with a complex programme "APELE
MOLDOVEI" working out. The experts of the Danube convention have
joined this project <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> far, as Moldova enjoys the rights as its
member. Till recent time, the Department has been mainly
concerned about the spring floods situation. According to the
local experts' estimation, the main water artery of Moldova, the
Dniester river, was under a threat of pollution, because of the
heavy snow melting.In the neighboring Ukraine a threatening
situation might appear in the region, because of probability of
the upper Dniester tank floods. It could lead to the necessity
of letting out an artificial sea, which took the main blow of
the accident at the Stebnikovsky Chemical Complex in 1983, when
a considerable part of the harmful emission was managed to be
kept in the alignment of the dike. Every time when speaking
about water resources conservation in Moldova, a question of "a
building of the century", an oil terminal in Gurgulesti, appears
to be inevitably. Not only ecologists were frightened by the
scope of <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a>-called "giantmania". This syndrome is still kept
going nowadays. However, as the western experience shows, even
those industrial monsters could work normally without any
environmental impacts, if the strict ecological requirements are
observed thoroughly. Today the economy of Moldova needs some
alternative sources of power supply. The terminal building in
Gurgulesti undoubtedly is one of the real ways of this uneasy
problem solution. Nevertheless, taking into consideration the
mistakes of the past, one should definitely remember
indisputable truth: no economical necessity of a certain project
could prevail over the ecological safety considerations and the
international obligations of Moldova before the neighboring
states. As to the building of the oil terminal, its
environmental impact assessment will be surely done. This
tedious work is entrusted to the scientific center of the same
profile - the National Institute of Ecology, said Sergiu
Fandofan in conclusion.

Dendroparks: Hard Times

by Valentina Malikova, IEA "Altair" - During a voluntary day of
work in the dendropark the citizens of Chisinau fixed more than
five hectares of the unique plantations. On the National Day of
Trees Planting forty volunteers came to the park: people of
different professions, schoolchildren, pensioners. Together with
the officials of the dendropark they cleaned flower-beds from
the last year's leaves and helped to refresh the trees'
saplings. The dendropark is a famous sight of Moldova's capital.
It captures visitors by its inimitable beauty, recognized as a
landmark of landscape architecture. Situated in the place of the
busy freeways almost in the centre of the city this green area
clears the air and absorbs traffic noise. Not accidentally a
small lake here was chosen by wild ducks for a winter stay while
nightingales got accustomed to living in brushwood of the
bushes. The dendropark of Chisinau was set up forty five years
ago by the scientists of the Botanical Garden of the Republican
Academy of Sciences. Now flora representatives from almost all
the continents grow and fruit here. (...) The shortage of
finances causes high staff fluidity. For the same reason it's
quite hard to provide protection of green plants as well as the
proper care of them. Many (...) people (...) use this
unfavourable situation to destroy shrubs' and trees' collection.
The State Department for Environmental Protection and Natural
Resources hopes for the improvement of the situation in the
dendroparks with the adoption of the Law on Protected Natural
Territories. Well, we shall see the outcome.

A Right To Informaton

by Natalya Sinyaeva - The working group of the Ecological
Society "Biotica" started the elaboration of the draft law of
Moldova on the Right to Ecological Information. "The work
supported by the USAID through Eurasia Foundation is planned to
be over this September," Petr Gorbunenko, the president of
Biotica, reported. The importance of the legislative regulation
of the right to get the ecological information is explained by
the fact that despite the right reflected in the Constitution of
Moldova neither citizens, nor their organizations or journalists
could use it to the full advantage as the mechanism of its
realization has not been worked out properly. Whereas in 1990
the countries of the European Union worked out the minimal rules
on getting the information about the environmental conditions.
The inculcation of these rules into the national legislation is
being finished this year. Moldova took the commitment of
providing this right after signing the Declaration of Sofia
Conference of the Environmental Protection European Ministers
(1995). The realization of the right to the ecological
information should permit NGOs and citizens a possibility of
getting full information about potentially dangerous enterprises
and to make a proper public environmental impact assessment.
Certainly some resistance on the part of the authorities towards
the adoption of the effective law could be awaited still the
initiators hope to overcome these obstacles. In case of success
it will be the first law of the kind in CIS countries.

Pollution And Infections

by Valentina Malikova, IEA "Altair" - With summer coming to
Moldova, microbe pollution monitoring of the rivers, lakes and
other open reservoirs has been reinforced. The systematic
laboratory tests of water samples for timely exposure of the
acute intestinal infections, including a vibrio of cholera have
been set. "The acute intestinal infections present a serious
problem for the health of the population of our republic",- said
V.P. Chicu, Candidate of Medical Sciences, Assistant Professor,
a Deputy Director of the National Scientific- Practical Center
of Hygiene and Epidemiology. "As a matter of fact, 19,843
patients with the diseases of that profile were registered last
year, that is 457 people for 100,000 local residents. The most
prevailing diseases were dysentery, enterocolitis,
gastroentercolitis, food toxic infections, salmonellosis. In
addition, 1995 was registered as a year of critical rise in
cholera infection - 240 cases all in all. Among the most
affected places were Tiraspol, the regions of Slobozea, Stefan
Voda, Comrat, Ungheni. The highest level of the intestinal
infections spreading was registered in the regions of Ribnita,
Dubosari, Cahul, Stefan Voda and Causeni. In the region of
Transnistria this index was 1.6- 2.6 times higher than the
average republican level. And, everywhere children under six
years were, as usual, the main victims of these diseases. A risk
of the intestinal infections in Moldova is aggravated by the
biological pollution of the environment, especially of natural
reservoirs. Certainly, a threat of the acute epidemic outbreaks
is increased when contaminated waste waters got into these
reservoirs. In 1994 there was such an outbreak in the town of
Straseni after the pouring rains and heavy flooding. Microbe
pollution of the local centralized water supply sources promoted
the epidemic acceleration. There was also a dysentery outbreak
in the first term of 1996 in the town of Falesti, caused by the
drinking water pollution. The epidemiological troubles caused by
these infections are a direct pollution effect of the natural
objects by the wastes waters which are not managed effectively
by the majority of purification works. Whereas a cholera vibrio
manifests miracles of survival. It can circulate in different
hydrobionts throughout many years, for example, in the bodies of
fish and molluscs, becoming an element of the ecosystems chosen.
<a name=L10003></a><a href=#L10004>So</a>, the water basins turn into reservoirs of the constant threat
of cholera spreading, which can influence the human health and
cause the death outcome. The situation seems to be likely in
Moldova against the background of the drinking water quality
worsening and activities reduction concerning the environmental
protection from the biological pollutants. In addition, many
water pipes functionate spasmodically, because they are
exhausted. The sanitary-technical conditions of wells are
absolutely unsatisfactory. As a result, in 1995 about 10 per
cent of water samples from the centralized sources and
practically every fourth sample taken from the wells didn't meet
the requirements of the state standards according to the
microbiologic indices. Meanwhile, there is a definite
correlation between the rate of water basins pollution and the
intestinal infections morbidity growth among the local
residents. It stands to reason, that in order to determine and
eliminate a microbe pollution of the environment, it is
necessary to reinforce activities of all the services,
departments and residents' groups. (...)

The Doctors Of Geneva Advise

by Tatyana Dobrynina (Nezavisimaya Moldova, N97, April 1996)
Recently in the framework of "Eurohealth" programme our republic
has been visited by the WHO mission. For several days the
members of the delegation were studying the situation regarding
the public health services in Moldova of the last years. They
visited the Republican Clinical Hospital and Children's Clinical
Hospital, the Yaloveni Regional Hospital and one of the regional
health centers. The delegates met the President of Moldova and
ministers of public health, finance and economy. The WHO experts
confirmed the preliminary information that the health services
expenses per capita have been reduced in the republic 7 times in
comparison to 1970. They paid attention to the low living
standard of the citizens of Moldova, because of insufficient and
low calories nutrition, psychological unsteadiness and
ecological impact, which cause many diseases. A critical
worsening in the demographic indices was registered, stating
that the general, and especially children's mortality increases,
while the birth-rate decreases. For example, 5 years ago a
national increase of population made up 8 for 1000, the last
year it was registered only 1.8 for 1,000, while in the majority
of the regions of the republic this increase is equal to zero,
and sometimes is even below zero. As far as different programmes
of aid to the states with the similar problems have been worked
out by the WHO head office in Geneva, the members of the
delegation needed only to arrange preliminary coordination of
the future mutual activities in order not to dispense efforts,
but concentrate them on the key hot problems of the day, working
on the public health protection development in Moldova.
"Together with the WHO experts", - T. Mosneaga, Minister of the
Public Health of Moldova, said, - "we managed to determine the
public health development priorities in the republic. First of
all, it is a mother-and-child health protection, family
planning, hygienic and sexual education problems solution.
Besides, we are going to introduce medical insurance, which
helps to provide medical aid to the pensioners, expectant
mothers and children. The visit of such an authoritative
delegation let us to create a programme of aid to the Republic
of Moldova. The Ministry of Public Health appealed to the WHO
with a request to examine the situation in the republic, to
admit its pitiful state in order to render assistance in
specialists training and partnerships establishing with medical
men of other countries.

Don't Destroy The Living Beauty

It happened <a name=L10004></a><a href=#L10005>so</a> that the beauty of primroses became a reason for
their death, <a name=L10005></a><a href=#L10006>so</a> far as being taken from the awakening ground
they immediately lose the life-giving threads and die. (...)
Among the first spring flowers 24 kinds are rare, 16 of the list
are included into the Red Book of Moldova. (...) In the
framework of their project on primroses protection in Moldova,
the ecological group FAUNA have published several articles in
the local papers realizing the goal to raise the population's
ecological culture and awareness on this point. The group also
appealed to the residents of Moldova not to destroy wild spring
flowers as well as not to buy them.

USAID-Activities on Environmental Problems in Moldova

As a part of the U.S.-Government's program of assistance and
cooperation with Moldova, the Agency for International
Development (USAID) is sponsoring a program of technical
assistance, training, and the provision of equipment for
environmental improvements. The purpose of the "Environmental
Policy and Technology Project (EPT)" is to address environmental
concerns related to agricultural practices and provide an
opportunity for the agricultural, ecological and public health
communities to utilize modern concepts of risk decision making
and, through cooperative efforts with improved technical
capabilities, provide solutions for environmental improvement
and address public health concerns relating to agricultural
production. The project began in January 1995, implementing a
number of valuable activities, including the support of Moldovan
ecological research institutions (NGOs and GOs), organization of
number of workshops on introducing the methodology of
environmental risk assessment, on improved agricultural
production practices, a Soil Erosion Modeling Training workshop,
and computer application training. A special course on risk
assessment has been introduced at six Universities during
Winter-Spring of 1996. In order to ensure the opportunities and
avenues for cooperation three localities-farms have been
selected in three different zones of Moldova to serve as
tangible settings for introducing alternative agricultural
practices that reduce environmental contamination (and,
subsequently, environmental risk) supported by improved
analytical capabilities. These sites are also to provide a
setting for technical training in improved agricultural
production techniques and practices, and in advanced soil
erosion monitoring. The sites are also utilized in initiating an
educational outreach campaign on the relationships between
agricultural production, environmental protection and public
health. (...) More activities are planned for the rest of 1996.
The main concern is demonstrating reduction in soil degradation
and pollution prevention methods. Several technical seminars and
training workshops, educational field tours to the demonstration
sites for children and students, publication of public awareness
brochures on ecological issues, including sustainable
agriculture are to occur by the end of the Project. (...)

GTZ-Activities on Environmental Problems in Moldova

On April 27- 30, 1996 in Chisinau the second seminar on the
project management for ecological NGOs of Moldova was held. It
was organized in the framework of the project "The Sphere of
Ecology Development in Moldova", supported by GTZ ( The German
Society on Technical Cooperation). Udo Heitmann, a GTZ
independent consultant, was the moderator of the seminar. 12
ecological organizations took an active part in the work of the
seminar. 5 projects on biodiversity preservation and 1 project
on the ecological NGOs of Moldova organizational development
have been worked out. Besides, the participants of the seminar
got acquainted with the GTZ information services in applied
technologies "Information and Advisory Service on Appropriate
Technology (ISAT)", along with the ecological literature and
information about the activities of some German NGOs, which
could be potential partners for the NGOs of Moldova. During the
work of the seminar a regular meeting of the NGO coordination
council took place. At this meeting a strategy of the further
project development and planned activities have been discussed.
There groups discussed also the council members' actions
coordination and other current organizational issues. A library,
organized on the basis of the Association of Ecological
Education and Information " TERRA NOSTRA", began its work. Here
one can find methodical materials, literature and other
documents, represented at the conference.

Milieaukontakt is Developing Contacts to NGOs in Moldova

On the 1-st of May, 1996 the meeting of the representatives of
Milieukontakt Oost-Europa, an NGO from the Netherlands, Math
Noortmann and Itske Lulof with ecological NGOs of Moldova took
place. The goal of the meeting was to get acquainted with the
local NGOs activities, to study the local situation and problems
the NGOs face, to get contact information in addition with some
questionnaire data. The meeting was organized within the
framework of a feasibility study. The objective of the
feasibility study was to find out whether and if, in which way,
Milieukontakt Oost-Europa could support the capacity building of
the Moldovan environmental movement. In our previous issue we
informed our readers about the expected visit of the
Milieukontakt representatives to Moldova. Unfortunately, the
information the correspondent of ALTAIR received concerning the
intentions of Milieukontakt in Moldova was not quite accurate.
As it became known after the meeting with the representatives of
this organization, presently there is no any definite project.
On the basis of the analysis and evaluation of the information
gathered during the trip to Moldova, a report will be published,
which will contain the conclusions and recommendations. On the
basis of this report a decision concerning a project in Moldova
will be taken. 

Giurgiulesti Oil-Terminal: Appeal For the Protection Of The
Danube

By the order of the government of the Republic of Moldova the
design works on the purified oil products terminal are being
finished. The terminal will be located in the south of the
republic in the place of the confluence zone of the Prut and the
Danube rivers. It is near the village of Giurgiulesti on the 400
m length of the Danube littoral. In the end of May the project
is to be approved and presented to the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development with the purpose of getting
credit in the amount of 30 million US dollars. The terminal will
operate in the ecologically vulnerable location in immediate
proximity to the biosphere reserve "DELTA DUNARII", a territory
protected by UNESCO, and to the nature reserve "PRUTUL DE JOS",
protected by the state. One oil terminal has been already
functioning in this region, namely, in Reni, Ukraine. The
Giurgiulesti terminal differs from the latter in the following
way: it will deliver processed fuel (like gasoline, diesel oil,
tar, etc.) and it will be equipped with a 173 m length wharf
with a berth for tankers of 5-10 thousand tons capacity running
in the Sumena branch. In 1994, ecological NGOs of the Republic
of Moldova were invited to two meetings, at which the experts of
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development were
discussing technical and economical substantiation of the
temporary wharf building for processed oil products. Then we
established the following: 1. The papers presented were not
subjected to the thorough ecological examination. 2. The
population residing the area of the terminal construction and
operation was not fully informed about the advantages and
shortcomings of this industrial object, supposed to be located
on the territory of the Giurgiulesti municipality.
Social-ecological problems were not touched upon in the papers
properly. Today it is proposed to carry out the work on the
project along with the experts' examination. This procedure is
permitted, but it can't replace a complex examination and
environment impact assessment of the project. We consider, that
after the preparatory works on the project it must be subjected
to the complex ecological examination on the part of the state
bodies and non-governmental organizations with the participation
of the specialists of the Republic of Moldova and neighbouring
countries on the national, regional and international levels in
different spheres: water and atmosphere resources; biodiversity,
landmarks and reserves; economic ecology; soil condition,
geological and hydrological situation; social and human ecology;
water transport; and international ecological legislation and
agreements ratified with neighbouring countries. We would like
to ask you to take into consideration the fact that the world
practice knows the cases when serious accidents on the terminals
located in the protected areas took place. It is not excepted
either that as a result of construction and exploitation of the
Giurgiulesti terminal there could take place a large-scale
ecological disbalance both in the mouth of the Danube and the
Prut rivers.

New Law On Ecological Examination And Impact Assessment

by Ilya Trombitskiy (Member of the Parliament of the Republic of
Moldova) On May 29, 1996, the Parliament of Moldova has adopted
the Law on Ecological Examination and Environmental Impact
Assessment. Since coming to the Parliamentary Commission from
the Government the draft law has undergone some principal
changes, connected with the necessity of turning it into a
document, meeting the international requirements concerning the
environmental impact assessment procedures. Primarily, the
project was called "About the State Ecological Examination", and
it didn't contain any description of the public and NGO
participation procedure in the future economic activities
decisions, while the Environmental Impact Assessment was not
envisaged at all. At the members' of the Commission urgent
request a separate chapter has been included into the bill,
explaining in details the ecological NGOs' and initiative
groups' participation procedure in case they wish to get
information about any ecologically dangerous activities planned
and the officials' responsibility who prevent these groups from
examination. To realize a public ecological examination an NGO
should apply to the local authorities where the object
construction is planned. In their application the NGO should
indicate information on the expert commission staff along with
the information on the object of examination, terms of its
undertaking, an extract from the NGO's regulations stating that
it stipulates such kind of activities. In case when applications
came from two or more public associations, a mixed commission is
formed. The local authorities are to present the project
documentation. The results of the public ecological examination
should bear a recommending character till their approval by the
state ecological examination. In case when a supposed object is
a large-scaled one or it is potentially ecologically dangerous,
according to the law, the environmental impact assessment
procedure should be prior to the state ecological examination.
Both registered public nongovernmental associations and
initiative groups of residents, including not less than 100
people, could take part in examination. However, at greater
length the law regulates the state ecological examination. The
projects of the legislative, normative and instructive
documents, the projects dealing with the problems of
environmental pollution, international and concessive
agreements, social development plans, economic activities are
subjected to this examination. The system of the state
ecological examination includes subdivisions and organizations
of the central ecological department, which activities are
determined by the department documents. A representative of the
customer or the elaborator of the project, also representatives
of the ministries and organizations whose activities are related
to the object examined, cannot act as the state ecological
examination experts. The document adopted seems to have a number
of shortcomings. Firstly, it contains a rule according to which
only a specialist having no less than five years of experience
in the industrial objects projecting can be a state ecological
examination expert; this fact makes an examination a kind of
one-sided technically in advance. Secondly, the standard,
according to which an NGO presenting a public examination
application should form a mixed expert commission by a forced
order, is obviously non-democratic. At last, a public ecological
examination of one industrial object cannot be undertaken more
than twice, what allows a more informed NGO to use efficiently
both opportunities (possibly - even a customer himself can use
them). Besides, an expediency of making a state ecological
examination procedure regulation exclusively by the department
instructions, not by the law, is rather doubtful. Nevertheless,
the adopted law makes grounds for civilized settlement of
collisions, which are likely to appear among ecologists,
producers and community during any possible planning of new
economic projects.


Conservation Management Support Network

A joint undertaking of the Dutch Karkonosze Foundation
(established in 1990 as a facilitating organisation for
cooperation with Central European institutes, GOs and NGOs), the
Board for Polish National Parks (NP) and all national park
administrations in Poland

by Henry Baumgartl 17.06.96 - The motivation for establishing
CMSN is the recognised need to substantially strengthen the
(organisational) capacity of national parks in Poland if they
are to effectively fulfil their role as corner stones of the
Polish strategy to conserve the still substantial landscape and
biological diversity in Poland, take action to prevent the
irreversible loss of currently threatened values and, where
possible, prepare for the restoration of lost biodiversity. And,
to create circumstances for the future of sensitive areas to
become truly sustainable. Establishing CMSN is to provide a
solid structure and model for effective communication /
co-ordination / co-operation among peers and relevant
stakeholders. And, to create the right infrastructure to build a
practical National Park Information System for the Polish
national park system (Poland has, at present, 21 national parks
(276 000 hectares) of which 6 are designated Biosphere Reserves
in the UNESCO MaB programme) which may, then, be easily adopted
by similar organisations (particularly in Central Europe).
Element of an ongoing process of landscape and biological
diversity protection efforts, developing the concepts for CMSN /
NPIS has been integrated in a number of closely related and
coordinated projects in Poland and countries to the South and
East of Poland. CMSN in particular, represents an innovative,
joint effort of Intergovernmental (IGO), governmental (GO), non
governmental (NGO) organisations, institutes and corporations to
participate in long term Biodiversity Protection efforts. In
practical terms, CMSN is part of the work programme of the
National Parks Component for which the Polish government has
borrowed two million US dollars from the World Bank under a
Polish Forestry Development Project financed by the World Bank
and the European Investment Bank. The additional funding
required for the realisation of the full NP Component will be
generated by applying a number of equally innovative strategies,
involving an even wider variety of sources than CMSN. The
initiators of CMSN are three organisations, whereby the
Karkonosze Foundation will initiate international, the Board for
Polish National Parks national (i.e. government, national
foundations / funds), and the national park administrations
local (i.e. regional and local governments, institutes, local
NGOs) input to CSMN. Any reader having had experience in the
management of conserving landscape and biological diversity,
will be well aware of the complexity of the described effort,
and I sincerely hope many of you will find the concept
interesting and challenging enough to become one of many active
participants in its realisation. The entire (development)
project will continue until the year 2000. As we hope to involve
a number of students / graduates in interdisciplinary workgroups
to realise specific tasks, do not hesitate to contact me to see
if this effort could be of help to you as well as to the
development process.

Institute for Sustainable Development (Warsaw)

(aus: WWF-US CEE Environmental Affairs Newsletter, June '96) The
Institute for Sustainable Development in Warsaw was founded in
1991 by Andrzej Kassenberg, Krzysztof Kamieniecki, and Zbigniew
Bochniarz. The Institute has compiled an extraordinary record of
accomplishments, addressing such pressing issues as
privatization and the environment, environmental impact
assessment, sustainable development in the "Green Lungs of
Poland", financing mechanisms and the environment, sustainable
tourism, agriculture and the environment, and transportation and
the environment. The author of the following report, on behalf
of the Polish Ecological Club, arranged the editor's initial
visit to Poland in April 1989. For further information, contact
The Institute for Sustainable Development (Instytut na rzecz
Ekorozwoju), ul. Lowicka 31, 02-052 Warsaw, Poland.

by Krzysztof Kamieniecki (October 1995) - Major Accomplishments:
For me, the greatest achievement of recent years is the founding
of the Institute, together with Andrzej and Zbyszek. It was
established as the end product of the thoughts and activities as
well as the frustrations of its founders through the 1980s.
Between 1991 and 1995, we managed to create a modern
institution, generating views, opinions, and inspiration for
politicians and high ranking State officials favorably inclined
towards proenvironmental transformations. The ease with which
the Institute reaches environmental organizations makes it
impossible for politicians and the administration antagonistic
to sustainable development to ignore the results of the studies
we conduct. The strength of the Institute lies in the
currentness of its actions, its professionalism, and the care
with which it engenders ties with NGOs. (...)

Major Pressing Issues: The question of constitutional order. I
place great weight on the question of how the newly emerging
Polish Constitution will relate to matters important to
sustainable development - the responsibility of the State for
the use of resources, the rights of present and future
generations to nature, the "right to know," and the obligations
of the public to the environment. The Institute initiated
discussions on ecology and the new Constitution; today is the
time to undertake more determined actions (lobbying,
campaigning) to guarantee a place for this topic in the basic
law of the land. Unfortunately, the atmosphere pervading work on
the draft Constitution does not promote such activities - a
greater organizational effort is needed. With respect to
regional issues, transportation is crucial. The Institute
started a project in 1995 on a proenvironmental concept for
transportation in Poland. There is an absence of a comprehensive
program of action for NGOs and pro-environmental politicians
throughout the whole of Europe to bring about change in the
transportation system. (...)

Unaddressed Needs: Developing an ability to communicate with the
community. I get the impression that local government, like the
NGOs, though in a different dimension, is having problems with
maintaining collaboration with the public among which and for
whom it acts.

Major Positive Surprises: The possibility of cooperation with
foreign institutions for sustainable development in developing
and implementing the concept of sustainable development is
exciting. Such collaboration is easy and interesting in the case
of American institutions, significantly more difficult among
European ones, and almost non-existent when speaking of Latin
American institutions.

Major Unexpected Problems and Possible Solutions: Difficulties
in embarking on collaboration with medium- and large-scale
business. Polish business fails to see benefits in participating
in the process of pro-environmental transformations of the
economy. (...)

Major Changes Impacting Our Work Positively and Negatively:
There can be no doubt that the return of democracy for Poland is
a good thing. We are living in a different country and hopefully
this will remain true for as long as possible. The existence and
activities of the Polish Ecological Club (PKE) are a continuing
phenomenon. I am concerned about the appearance of unemployment
and the lack of any proposal for its amelioration through
sustainable development. European works on this point, though
interesting, are fragmentary. Should eco-politicians be
successful in creating a program significantly decreasing
unemployment, then there will be a breakthrough in the
implementation of sustainable development. Local government will
open up to it, and NGOs will have a new, creative field for
action.

MINATOM of Russia Has Discussed The New NPP Projects

by Oleg Bodrov, Sankt-Petersburgh (According to the materials of
Russian MinAtom collegium) - Giving the opportunity to EBRD to
be engaged in the questions of safety of old Russian NPPs,
MinAtom of Russia has considered the new projects. The
worth-while NPPs are seemed to be V-407 and V-392. The first of
reactors, known as NP-500 or WWER-640, is intended to be built
in Sosnovy Bor (the main power unit) and also, in Kola NPP (3
nuclear power units), and in Far East of Russia (4 nuclear power
units). The project has gained interest in Bulgaria and
Byelorussia. The reactor of large power B-392 is intended to
inculcate in Novovoronezh (2 nuclear power units). To obtain the
permission to build new reactors in Sosnovy Bor and Novovoronezh
is considered to be the main task of MinAtom for the 1995 year.
The designers of nuclear power submarines from Nizhny Novgorod
will get the minimal financial support, too. The NPP project
proposed by them with new reactor WPBER-800 accumulated the
experience of creating of more than 300 reactors for nuclear
submarines. New technical decisions for this NPP will be tested
on the new stand KV-2. The designers of brider reactors BN-800
are advised "to persistently knock at the region doors. "The
most perspective place for this knocking is Chelyabinsk "Mayak".
As for channel-type reactor MKER-800, that is proposed to
substitute old RBMK-1000, it already has the source of
financing. The source is... the sold electrical energy of
operating RBMK-1000 power units, and, to some extent, EBRD
support. 

Storm over nuclear waste brewing in Russian Far East

By Philippa Fletcher (Vladivostok, April 18, Reuter) - (...) The
people of the Far Eastern port city Vladisvostok have mixed
feelings about the ban on dumping radioactive waste at sea,
despite the fact that the latest culprit was the Pacific Fleet,
based right on their doorstep. Officials, ecologists and
journalists here share the view that little harm was done by
liquid nuclear waste once poured into the sea by many countries
and dumped here quietly and regularly until 1993, when the world
found out and protested. What bothers them more is that other
countries might now send their radioactive waste to Russia for
reprocessing. (...) After the latest dumping became public,
Russia called for help to solve the problem <a name=L10006></a><a href=#L10007>so</a> that it could
turn a hastily imposed temporary ban into a permanent one.
Japan, where fish prices had plummeted on news that the Russian
navy had poured 800 tonnes of radioactive waste into nearby
seas, quickly offered $25 million to fund a nuclear reprocessing
facility. At the beginning of this year, a contract was finally
signed with an international consortium led by Japan's Tomen
Corporation. Local ecologists were suspicious of the large
planned capacity which they argue exceeds the Fleet's needs.
Their fears multiplied after a radio interview early this year
with the head of the Taiwan power company who said he was
negotiating to dispose of low level nuclear waste in Russia.
Officials have denied repeatedly that any such agreement exists
with Taiwan or any other country, although the environmental
group Greenpeace reported last month that it had won a court
case to stop a plan to deliver foreign waste to a plant further
west in Siberia. The Vladivostok newspaper Vremya summed up
local concerns: "Japanese taxpayers' money will be put into a
project which is totally unnecessary for their safety and which
will probably be used by Russian officials as a source of income
from reprocessing foreign waste," it said. Mixed up amid the
allegations and denials is a separate row between the local
authorities in Vladivostok and Moscow, seven time zones further
west. This one could scuttle the project. The locals, who
complained they were not consulted over the project, insist that
Marubeni Corporation should process the waste, because its offer
was cheaper and more efficient. They feel <a name=L10007></a><a href=#L10008>so</a> strongly about it
that they are planning to catch Moscow out on one of its own
regulations -- the environmental requirements for any project
dealing with radioactivity. "They are <a name=L10008></a><a href=#L10009>so</a> strict that they have
never once been followed ...but they create a hook to catch
people on," said Anatoly Lebedev, an ecologist from the Far
Eastern Academy of Sciences. Yevgeny Simatyuk, the local
official dealing with the nuclear waste issue, is behind plans
to lodge a protest against the contract with the prosecutor
general. He is recovering from an assault by unknown attackers
outside his home which left him with a fractured skull. In the
meantime, the Fleet has been forced to introduce an alternative
way of dealing with the nuclear waste, stored since 1993 in
rusting tankers. Environmentalists say the Russian design system
is coping for the time being although it creates the problem of
dealing with the filters contaminated in the process. Where all
the attention is focused on the liquid waste problem, the issue
of how to deal with the far more dangerous solid nuclear waste
has taken a back seat. Valery Denilyan, head of the Pacific
Fleet's chemical defence service, said three badly damaged
nuclear submarines are moored off the coast. The reactor in one
exploded in 1985 in an accident similar to the nuclear disaster
at Chernobyl less than a year later. (...) There are up to 10
more dismantled reactors on pontoons and another 50 submarines
awaiting decomissioning by 2010. The Star repair and
decommissioning plant in Bolshoi Kamen, on the opposite side of
the bay from Vladivostok, takes apart barely more than one
submarine a year. "It's a question of financing, then there's
the problem of what to do with the spent nuclear fuel. (...)
With problems like these, Denilyan welcomed international help
but not everyone in the Russian military feels the same. When
the European Union launched a tender to investigate the "Lepse"
vessel in Russia's far north, a problem as serious as Denilyan's
three submarines -- it became caught in a row over alleged
military secrets contained in the tender document. (...)

Radioactive water threatens Russian region of Chelyabinsk

By Timothy Heritage (Moscow, April 11, Reuter) - An official
ecology commission said a new environmental disaster could hit
Russia's Chelyabinsk region, one of the most radioactive places
on Earth, and asked the government to investigate. Alexei
Yablokov, who chairs the ecological safety commission in
President Boris Yeltsin's advisory Security Council, called for
a government review of the potential threat posed by a series of
reservoirs contaminated by liquid radioactive waste. He told a
news conference there was a risk that the water, polluted by
emissions from the nearby Mayak nuclear plant, could overflow
the reservoirs' walls in the River Techa and endanger the local
environment and population. The Chelyabinsk region, in the
southern Ural mountains, is already scarred after a nuclear
accident in 1957 which Yablokov said had made a lake near Mayak
"the most radiation-polluted place on Earth." "If anything
happens to the reservoir walls, all the population living
downstream could be in a critical condition," Yablokov, an
anti-nuclear campaigner, said. Yablokov issued a document drawn
up by his commission asking the Russian government to review the
likely dangers if an accident hit the reservoirs. The commission
said it considered it a priority to remove any risk of disaster
and that a plan should be worked out to evacuate the local
population if there were an accident. Yablokov said 400 million
cubic metres (14.14 billion cubic feet) of poisoned water were
contained in the reservoirs. He did not say how many people
might be affected if the water overflowed but towns downstream
from Mayak, such as Muslyumovo, are still inhabited. For decades
the Soviet government hushed up a series of nuclear disasters in
the Chelyabinsk area, about 1,500 km (950 miles) east of Moscow,
when Mayak was a top secret centre of the Soviet Cold War
weapons programme. Officials say that in the first seven years
of its operation, from 1949 to 1956, the Mayak plutonium plant
poured 76 million cubic metres (2.68 billion cubic feet) of
liquid radioactive waste straight into the Techa. In 1957, an
explosion at a reservoir containing nuclear waste blasted
radiation over an area of 20,000 sq km (7,723 sq miles) of the
lakeland region. The full effects of the accident remain
uncertain to this day because victims were evacuated to distant
parts of the Soviet Union and no records were kept of where they
went. About 44,000 people have responded to requests to complete
a register of those who were in the area at the time, Yablokov
said. But this represented only about one in 10 of the total.
Yablokov said 120 million curies of radiation had polluted the
nearby Karachai Lake, more than twice the amount of radiation
spewed out in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Much of Karachai
has been sealed with concrete but Yablokov said the 300,000
curies of radiation in the Techa posed a greater threat. "We
think this is now a bigger danger than the Karachai," he said.

Norway, Russia to cooperate on nuclear waste

By Philippa Fletcher MOSCOW, Dec 15 (Reuter) - Russia and Norway
agreed on December 15, 1995, to work together to dispose of
military waste, including spent nuclear fuel dumped by Russia in
areas close to the Norwegian border. But the deal, signed by the
two countries' defence ministers was short on substance and
clouded by Russia's charge of spying against the work of the
Norwegian environmental group which has drawn most attention to
the nuclear dumping problem. Grachev said reporters concerns
about radioactive pollution from nuclear waste buried on
Russia's Arctic Novaya Zemlya island or stored in vessels moored
off the Kola Peninsula were unfounded. "The level of
radioactivity on Novaya Zemlya is lower than in my office in the
defence ministry," he said, blaming the media for whipping up
the problem with distorted information. "In order to convince
people that it is safe we decided to work more closely on
checking and informing the population...I suggested to Minister
Kosmo to...fly together to Novaya Zemlya with a Geiger counter
and fly wherever my guest wants." Norwegian scientists
previously invited to check radiation levels in the region have
said they are not above normal. But they have been stopped from
going to certain areas deemed to be militarily sensitive and
remain concerned about the danger. Siri Engesaeth, activist of
the Norwegian environmental group Bellona, told by telephone
from Oslo that the only available technology the Russians have
to remove the military nuclear waste would involve exposing
5,000 people to deadly levels of radiation. "They want to tow it
to Novaya Zemlya and store it there," she said, adding that
project's future was now unclear.

Dismantling Of Nuclear Submarines May Increase Pollution

by Christian Rekkedal (Oslo/Norway, 04.07.96) - (...) Kvaerner
Moss Technology have made the pre-study to a project dealing
with dismantling of decommissioned nuclear submarines. Norway
shall use 150 million NOK. The negotiations on a
Norwegian-Russian agreement shall be finished within June 30.
"The plan presumes, among other things, that the storages for
spent fuel at the Andrejeva bay shall be emptied. The fuel are
to be sent to the reprocessing facilities at Mayak. (Norway
shall eventually also contribute to building a temporarly
storage plant in Majak.) "Bellona asks the Foreign department to
forget the plans. The foundation states that the venture will
not contribute to a betterment of the environmental situation in
Russia. On the contrary they point to the huge problems in
association with the waste and emmissions from the reprocessing
plant at Mayak. "If the authorities goes forth with this
problem, it will mean increased emissions and direct health
consequences for the populace in the area," states Thomas Nilsen
at Bellona. (...)

Russian Citizens Are Fighting A U.S. Co-Funded Reprocessing Plant

Citizens of the Russian town of Sergei Posad are fighting a
government plan to build a U.S. co-funded plant in their town to
reprocess thousands of tons of heptyl, a highly toxic chemical
used as liquid rocket fuel. There are unwanted stocks of heptyl
(dimethylhydrazine) at various military installations around
Russia where missiles and rockets are made and launched. Russia
continued to use liquid rocket fuel long after America switched
to solid fuel, largely because it was cheaper. However, heptyl
is highly toxic, carcinogenic, easily soluble in water (which
means in the event of a leak it can spread quickly and easily)
and, of course, very volatile. Estimates of how much heptyl is
stored in Russia's former "closed cities," the Soviet-era secret
towns like Sergei Posad, in Soviet days known as Zagorsk, range
from 50,000 tons to 150,000 tons. At the Scientific Research
Institute of Chemical and Construction Machines (SRICCM) based
in Sergei Posad, there are over 100 tons of heptyl in storage.
And if the new reprocessing facility is installed, at least
another 10,000 tons will be brought there from the other sites
in Russia. Hundreds of signatures have been collected on
petitions protesting about the plans. "The people of this town
object to these plans, and rightly <a name=L10009></a><a href=#L10010>so</a>," says the mayor of Sergei
Posad, Vasili Goncharov, who is leading the protests. "We
already have enough problems to contend with in this area,
including a radon depository and a testing site for storage of
pesticides and household waste." (...) The facility to be built
in Sergei Posad, some 70 kilometers from Moscow, will be
constructed with U.S. aid under the Congress-backed Nunn-Lugar
technical assistance program. This has raised fears that foreign
heptyl will also be brought in for treatment. "The reprocessing
project is tied to deliveries of heptyl from abroad, especially
from the United States," alleges Goncharov. "This is part of a
wider policy of dumping dangerous and harmful production
processes on us here in Russia." Henryk Matysyak, Director of
SRICCM, absolutely denies this. "Only Russian heptyl will be
processed in Sergei Posad," he insists. (...) Matysyak is
certain that the town's people will eventually accept the
facility. He cited earlier protests against the dismantling of
naval missiles, which rapidly abated. "Given the high level of
unemployment today and the fact that the reprocessing project
will create good jobs, I do not expect the opposition to last
long," he explains. "The facility will give workers the
opportunity of earning up to 500,000 rubles ($100) a month with
no payment arrears." Average wages paid by cash-strapped
employers are significantly lower than this in Russia. (...)
Viewed in the wider context, however, the project is causing
concern to environmentalists who fear that Russia may rapidly be
becoming the world's toxic waste dump. Last year the
environmental commission of Russia's Security Council found that
over 2,000 tons of dangerous wastes from abroad were being
brought into the country every day. (...)

RUSSIA NEEDS FOREIGN ASSISTANCE TO DESTROY CHEMICAL WEAPONS

by Scott Parrish (24.7.96) - Nikolai Bezborodov, deputy chairman
of the Duma Defense Committee, said that Russia will need
significant financial assistance to destroy its stock of some
40,000 tons of chemical weapons, ITAR-TASS reported on 22 July.
He was commenting on the latest session of the Preparatory
Commission for the Establishment of an Organisation for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in the Hague, which is
reviewing progress toward implementing the 1993 Chemical Weapons
Convention. Bezborodov said Russia would need 17 trillion rubles
($3.3 billion) to liquidate its chemical weapons stockpile,
adding: "I think we will not manage without serious foreign
aid." Russia has still not ratified the convention, and
Bezborodov said it would not do <a name=L10010></a><a href=#L10011>so</a> until after the "material,
legislative, and other preconditions for its implementation are
in place."

Phenol poisoning hits Russian region after crash

Moscow, May 20 (Reuter) - Highly toxic phenol released in a
train crash last week has caused an ecological disaster in
central Russia, putting more than 100 people in hospital and
threatening many more, Itar-Tass news agency said on Monday. It
said those taken ill had been involved in clearing up after
several freight wagons were derailed near the town of Shumerlya,
600 km (375 miles) east of Moscow, on May 14. Health authorities
said a further 100 people still working at the accident site
were at risk and there was also a threat of a "mass poisoning"
of the local population, Tass reported. Phenol, also known as
carbolic acid, seeped into streams, causing widespread
ecological damage, and had polluted the Sura river, which flows
north into the Volga. Vapours, which damage the liver and
kidneys, had also been released into the air. (...) Environment
Minister Viktor Danilov-Danilyan was quoted as saying on Monday
that of a stockpile of 80 billion tonnes of industrial and
consumer waste in Russia, 1.6 billion tonnes of it posed a
threat to human health and the environment. The country created
around 800 kg of dangerous waste per head of population every
year, Tass reported him as saying. 

Informations and Scientific Work On Lake Baikal Needed.

In March of 1996 USAID informed represantatives of Russian
environmental NGOs that a grant to provide assistance to solve a
problem related to the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Mill. CH2MHill
was chosen as a contractor to carry out this project. Director
of the Project Dennis Whelan asked us to help with distribution
of the following letter:

"(May 8, 1996) Dear Colleagues: I am writing for help in
developing background information on environmental issues
relating to Lake Baikal. (...) In coordination with ongoing
Gore-Chernomyrdin-Commission activites, the Ministry of the
Environment of the R.F. asked USAID to help with evaluations of
various proposals to restructure / reprofile the Baikalsk Pulp
and Paper Mill (BPPM). USAID, in turn, has asked CH2M Hill to
work on this task in its role as a contractor for the
Environmental Policy and Technology Project. In this regard, I
am writing for your help in securing the names and contact
information for international scholars and experts who have done
previous work on Lake Baikal in general and on environmental
issues related to the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Mill in
particular. We know that there are many independent Russian and
international teams that have worked the limnology of the lake,
the effects of human activity upon the lake, and alternatives to
pulp production at the BPPM. We would greatly appreciate any
help that you can give us in contacting these individuals and in
accessing the vast body of data and information that already
exists in connection with these problems, including the names
and contact information for individuals and groups that have
information and experience relating to Baikal and the BPPM.

Greenpeace Russia's World Heritage Project

(Greenpeace International, Patrick Anderson, (GP) December 8,
1995) As part of a major nature conservation project centered in
Russia, Greenpeace has announced the first of a set of
territories to be included in the World Natural Heritage List,
UNESCO's "Nobel Prize" of natural objects. The Project's intent
is the full protection of Russia's most valuable and extensive
funds of biodiversity both in the short term as Russia suffers
an environmental-economic crisis and in the long term as
catalysts in the search for environmentally sound alternative
investment projects. After six years of unsuccesful attempts by
the government to prepare the nomination for Lake Baikal and at
the same time risking the environmental balance of the lake and,
in fact, the majority of intact ecosystems left in Russia, this
ambitious project aims to protect some of Russia's most valuable
natural spaces. Greenpeace Russia has taken the lead in
organising the nominations of several natural areas to the List
by tapping into the resources and guiding the efforts of dozens
of local and national conservation groups, indigenous peoples
and government agencies. The list, administered by the United
Nations' organisation, UNESCO, also contains such natural
wonders as the Grand Canyon and the Great Barrier Reef and
provides a forum for protection and recognition of the world's
most important natural and cultural sites. In order to carry out
the project, Greenpeace has had push for the creation of entire
new park and conservation zone systems, lobby local governments
to devote the areas and promise to conserve them and animate
researchers and conservation planners to make the project
effective. Indigenous peoples and local communities have played
an important and leading role in the development of nearly all
of the sites, demonstrating the need for a fuller consideration
of the sustainability of life-styles outside of both Western and
Eastern industrial paradigms and based on closer relationships
to nature. Greenpeace has already made the first nomination to
the list, the Virgin Komi Forests, 3.2 million hectares of
pristine forest along the Ural Mountains in the Republic of Komi
in the Russian Far North. Current proposed nomination sites for
the list: Primorsky Kray, Far East: a vital habitat of the
endangered Amur tiger and the Far East leopard, 4 million
hectares including the Sikhote-Alin Natural Complex and the
Bikin Valley, the home of the Udege Indigenous people. The
Volcanoes of Kamchatka: active and dormant volcanoes, geysers,
thermal and mineral springs and bubbling mud cauldrons among
perfectly conserved transforming coastal and forest ecosystems.
4 million hectares. The Sources of the Great Ob, Altai
Mountains, Central Siberia: 6.5 million hectares of virgin
mountain taiga, glaciers and the sacred Telestkoye Lake.
Vodlozero Park, Northwest of European Russia: Europe's largest
intact old-growth boreal forests and pristine wetlands. 1
million hectares. Ubsunur Hollow, Tuva Republic: a
Cultural-Natural project carried out in conjunction with the
Mongolian government, 7.5 million hectares, one of the largest
intact watersheds in Central Asia where 40,000 archeological
sites can be found from histroically famous nomadic tribes such
as the Scythians, the Turks and the Huns.

The Virgin Komi Forests: Forming Europe's natural eastern border
along the Ural Mountains, the Virgin Komi Forests are the
continent's largest unfragmented old-growth forests representing
a wide variety of integrated ecosystems ranging from boreal
forests in the southern part of the territory to subarctic taiga
in the north. The forests, mountains, wetlands and river valleys
that make up the system are a haven for dozens of rare species
and contain one of Europe's most valuable stores of
biodiversity. The area counts 43 species of mammals, including
the brown bear, sable and the highly migratory elk, 204 species
of birds, including the Whitetailed eagle, and 16 species of
fish, the most valuable of which is the salmon that helps
sustain the economies downstream. The forests consist of spruce,
cedar and fir, filled with unique and rare slow-growth floral
species. Indigenous peoples Early Russian chronicles from the
tenth and eleventh centuries record the existence of native
peoples in the area of what is now the Komi Virgin Forests. Up
to the present day many place names as well record the passing
of these peoples: the Pechora River, for example, is named for a
tribe that has since either disappeared or has been incorporated
into larger groups. The peoples that still live in the area,
today known as the Komi, still depend upon the natural
surroundings as they have stood for thousands of years. The
herds of reindeer that need the vast forests to graze , the
salmon and other small-scale fisheries, the berries, nuts and
mushrooms that are collected seasonally, and the hunting of wild
hare and various wild forest birds all attest to the necessity
of keeping the forests in their present, virgin state. In 1994
these forests came under direct threat from many sides. A
foreign timber company began to carry out clearcut logging along
the Pechora and Ilych Rivers while one of the world's largest
oil spills destroyed the river and villages downstream. There
was no help in sight: park officials can go months without pay
and nature conservation has been forgotten in the economic
crisis. While Greenpeace campaigners decried the destruction
downstream, Greenpeace researchers got to work upstream to
organise a nomination to UNESCO's World Natural Heritage List.
In making the nomination, Greenpeace completed its successful
campaign to stop French and Austrian logging companies from
using destructive and unsustainable clearcut methods on Komi
territory and demonstrated the need to assure protection for
these vital natural areas.

Siberian tigers future threatened by cash crunch

Vladivostok, Russia, April 16 (Reuter) - An anti-poaching team
set up to protect endangered Siberian tigers in Russia's Far
East is set to be disbanded in July because the regional nature
protection committee can no longer afford to fund it. Committee
chairman Mikhail Bibikov said instructions from Moscow to cut
back on staff left him no choice but to lay off the team,
despite the threat to the remaining tigers, who number no more
than 230. "How can I keep them on? There's no money. I have to
cut back 62 staff and the brigade will be among them," Bibikov
told Reuters. Bibikov's committee is part of the Environment
Ministry. "The government signed a resolution to defend the
tigers but they did not give us a kopeck," he said. "I found the
money from somewhere but I cannot any longer." The brigade, set
up in 1994, got $180,000 in annual international donations last
July, mainly from the German branch of the World Wildlife Fund
and U.S.-based Global Security Network. But that alone was not
enough. "The foreigners do not want to let the tigers disappear.
But the government does not seem to care about Russia's natural
riches," he said. Most of the Siberian, or Amur, tigers live in
the taiga of the Primorsky region in Russia's far southeastern
corner sandwiched between China and Sea of Japan. "There is very
strong pressure on the tigers today because there is great
demand in China for their skins, their bones, their meat. As a
result their number has been reduced by half," said Bibikov. "If
the team is not there, then anyone would be able to shoot
anything they like in the taiga," he said. Bibikov said the team
has confiscated 16 tiger skins last year as well several
leotards and many bear skins. They also made a string of arrests
and confiscated weapons. "They worked well, got good results.
It's a shame," said Bibikov.


Diamond mining in Sakha - need for environmental protection

By Nina A. Trofimova (29.04.96) - (...) Russia's industrial
"progress" has taken a particular toll on the fragile ecosystems
of the North. Two hundred miles of radiation-poisoned riverbank
near Aikhal in Siberia bear the scars of repeated nuclear tests,
as does the lunar landscape carved out by extensive mining
operations in the Vilyui River Basin. Pollution from mining The
largest mining company operating in Sakha, Almazy Rossii-Sakha
(Russia-Sakha Diamonds), was originally established in the '50s
as part of an industrialization strategy for the Vilyui basin.
Under the plan, a series of mining towns sprouted up almost
overnight, including the city of Mirny and the towns of Aikhal
and Udachny. Near these boomtowns, numerous large-scale quarries
were gouged out of the land. One such mine is the Mir complex,
525 meters deep and 1.5 kilometers in diameter. Today mining
operations occupy 1,655 hectares of land in Sakha. Accidental,
but nonetheless frequent, releases of untreated mineralized
water (with concentrations of up to 100 grams per liter) into
surface watercourses over the last 10 years have resulted in
average annual contamination levels as much as eight times the
maximum allowed. The impact on mortality rates in polluted areas
is undeniable: the average life span in the Vilyui region is
less than 58.9 years for men and 67.1 years for women, far below
the average for Sakha as a whole. Infant mortality in the area,
38.1 percent in 1993, is also significantly higher than the
republic-wide rate of 23 percent. While mining severely pollutes
waterways and defaces natural landscapes wherever it occurs, the
effects of mining are especially pronounced in the Arctic
regions of the republic. Despite a significant reduction in
mining activity in recent years, landscape degradation and water
pollution due to diamond mining in the Vilyui River Basin remain
high especially since exhausted mines continue to contaminate
their surroundings with toxic by-products for up to 10 years
after they cease operating. As a result, in 1992 the Russian
Federation declared the Vilyui Basin an important part of the
Lena River watershed, an environmental disaster area. Regulatory
disarray Russia's worsening economic situation exacerbates
Sakha's environmental crisis. The desire for rapid prosperity
has prompted a frenzied rush for resources despite the fact that
the outdated industrial technologies in use throughout the
region are ravaging the land. (...) (Nina A. Trofimova is the

Overflight Of The Sukpai, Samarga and Khor Watersheds

by Dale Miquelle (RFE EPT Biodiversity Manager) April 13, 1996
The upper portion of the Samarga, Bikin and adjacent sections of
the watersheds in Khabarovsk Krai are the last intact remnants
of the central Sikhote-Alin bioregion and with the exception of
minimal native impact on sustainable replenishable resources,
these regions are wilderness in the classic sense of the
concept. This could change very quickly, with pending road plans
and free market economics placing new pressures on these regions
and directly threatening the vitality of biodiversity upon which
local peoples are dependent for the traditional ways of life
that have evolved with region. Ecologically Sustainable
Development (ESD) booked an overflight of the Sukpai and Khor
River watersheds in southern Khabarovskii Krai and the Samarga
watershed in northern Primorskii Krai in order to check existing
land use patterns.(...) Flying across the 'Khabarovsk Nakhodka'
highway, that is now being constructed on the far side of the
Bikin River about 150 kilometers south of our flight line, and
skirting the villages of Obor, Durmin and Malaya Sidima on our
port side, the flatlands give way to quickly rising mountains
that are girded by an extensive road system. Intensive harvest
of these forests began around 50 years ago, in most part by
people held in rehabilitation camps before and after the second
world war. The approaches to the peaks have been heavily
harvested and a snowy background highlights where the forest has
been removed. We were told that relatively good natural
regeneration is occurring in these regions. We also saw a couple
of locations where logging roads 'illegally' cross over
watershed divides, a remnant of Soviet era forest management.
Heading east, we soon came to the confluence of the Khor and
Sukpai Rivers with the village of Sukpai to our port. As we
continued east up the Sukpai drainage, to our north, large snow
covered clear cuts came into view, the aftermath of harvesting
efforts by the Cubans who worked these forests until the early
'90's. According to forest service officials, these forests were
first clear cut and then burnt and since then have repeatedly
burnt; no significant effort has been made to restock the
cleared lands. There are also a large number of 'natural'
openings formed as a result of forest fires. The southern side
of the Sukpai is a patchwork of harvest areas that reveal no
apparent pattern, as the Cubans cut where they wanted and what
they wanted. There is little evidence of clear cuts. This area
also has many burned over sections. These forests are mixed
conifer (spruce-fir), with extensive stands of larch in the
Tagemu and Yaa drainages. North Koreans are now working in these
areas. A plan was forwarded in the '80's to develop a zakaznik
in the lower and middle drainages of the Sukpai because of its
extraordinary biodiversity values. However, forest management
decisions put these plans to bed and there are few reasons to
now argue for limits on timber harvest here. Since the lower and
middle Sukpai have lost their significance as a potential
protected territory, the current effort is to protect the Chuken
drainage whose confluence with the Khor is about 30 kilometers
downstream of the point where our flight line crossed the
latter. This does not mean, however, that lower and middle
drainages should be abandoned to industrial harvest and large
scale clear cutting. These forests are degraded and ground
truthing is need to determine how timber removal has affected
general forest species diversity. What should follow is a forest
management plan that allows for sustainable timber harvest and
that works to restore forest values <a name=L10011></a><a href=#L10012>so</a> that a primary need for
timber can meet in conditions that also provide for wildlife and
human values intricately interwoven into the fabric of these
lands. And special attention should be given to any management
plans for the headwaters of the Sukpai. This forest is a vital
buffer zone for the Bikin and Samarga watersheds. Any effort to
develop the upper Sukpai will create additional incentives to
open up these other watersheds, especially once a road system is
in place to remove timber from the headwaters. <a name=L10012></a><a href=#L10013>So</a> of particular,
immediate interest is the current status of the east/southeast
road that runs north of the Sukpai in a valley between this
river and the Kabuli drainage. The road draws close to the
Sukpai, and crosses it with the river via a major concrete
bridge, about 30 kilometers downstream of its confluence with
the Tagemu drainage. Given the capital expense to construct such
a structure, there is apparent strong interest in harvesting
timber in the headwaters of the Sukpai. (...)
