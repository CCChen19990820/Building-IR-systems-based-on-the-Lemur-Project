		<FONT SIZE="6"><B>Plans go forward for building new Walters State site in Sevier County</B></font><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By Jim Balloch, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>ORRISTOWN, Tenn. -- Despite a legal setback that scuttled an anticipated $4 million gift, Walters State Community College still plans to construct a new campus in Sevier County.
<P>   Construction of the first building, a $6 million general purpose facility, could begin as early as next summer, if the state Building Commission approves the project and authorizes the state Board of Regents to hire an architect.
<P>   The commission has not set a date to review the proposal, but &#39;&#39;we hope they will allow us to be heard as early as possible in the new year,&#39;&#39; said Vic Duggins, vice president for development at Walters State.
<P>   The facility will initially be designated a &#39;&#39;center for higher education,&#39;&#39; but it will eventually evolve into a full branch campus of Walters State with several buildings, Duggins said.
<P>   Walters State currently operates a small facility of about five classrooms on Gary Wade Boulevard in Sevierville.
<P>   Earlier this month, the Tennessee Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling that Walters State does not legally qualify for a $4 million bequest from the estate of William Wesley Burchfiel. 
<P>   Despite that ruling, the elected officials of Sevier County and the cities of Sevierville, Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg have all agreed to let Walters State keep more than $4 million they had contributed to meet the matching funds requirement established in Burchfiel&#39;s will.
<P>   Sevier County has provided $1.5 million, and Sevierville and Pigeon Forge put up $1 mi1lion each. Gatlinburg provided $800,000, and has pledged to raise another $200,000 from private contributions.
<P>   &#39;&#39;When they put that money up, they thought they were providing matching funds so Walters State could combine it with the Burchfiel estate (gift) to build a $9 million facility,&#39;&#39; Duggins said.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We have another $700,000 to come from private sources, most of them anonymous,&#39;&#39; Duggins added.
<P>     Additionally, The Walters State Sevier County Development Council, an arm of the Walters State Foundation that&#39;s made up entirely of Sevier Countians, has pledged to raise $1 million, Duggins said.
<P>   Walters State already owns a 67-acre tract in Sevier County at the corner of Pittman Center Road and Old Newport Highway. The land was a gift from Mrs. Reece Rapatti, Sevierville librarian.
<P>   Burchfiel&#39;s will decreed that the state board of regents supervise the use of his gift to establish an independent community college in Sevier County, if matching funds could be obtained. If that effort failed, the will stipulated that the University of Tennessee would be the alternative beneficiary.
<P>    A probate court judge ruled that Walters State Community College qualified for the gift, but the state Court of Appeals ruled otherwise.
<P>   Duggins vowed that Walters State would remain &#39;&#39;totally committed&#39;&#39; to providing Sevier Countians an opportunity for higher education at as low a cost as possible.

		</basefont><h3>Unidentified woman struck, killed by truck on I-75</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   The Tennessee Highway Patrol is seeking public help in identifying a woman who was struck and killed Saturday when she ran in front of a truck on Interstate 75 in Loudon County, authorities said.
<P>   THP Sgt. Charles Laxton said he and Trooper Daniel Ruskey have exhausted all leads on the possible identify of the woman who was hit by a truck about 5:30 p.m. in the southbound lanes of I-75 just past its split from Interstate 40.
<P>   Laxton said authorities suspect the woman was a hitchhiker. She was not carrying any identification.
<P>   According to Laxton, the woman ran into the path of a pickup truck. The truck stopped after striking the woman, and Laxton said charges against the driver are unlikely.
<P>   The unidentified victim was described as a white female with shoulder-length brown hair. She was in her 30s, weighed about 130 pounds and was 5 feet, 4 inches tall. She was wearing a gray sweatsuit.
<P>   Laxton asked for anyone with information about the woman call the Knoxville Highway Patrol office at 693-7311.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Three juveniles charged in beating, robbery of man</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   Three juveniles were charged early Sunday with robbery after they allegedly stalked their victim in downtown Knoxville and then hit him nearly a dozen times with a gun to get the $12 he had in his pocket, authorities said.
<P>   The juveniles, whose identities were not immediately available, were arrested after a pursuit from East Knoxville to Northwest Knoxville, according to Knoxville Police Department Lt. Mark Pressley.
<P>   The incident was reported at 1:02 a.m. According to police, the suspects began watching the victim after they saw him at the Greyhound Bus Station at the intersection of Magnolia Avenue and Central Street.
<P>   One of the alleged teenaged robbers was driving a pickup truck, and the other two were on foot, police said. When the victim left the bus station, also on foot, the suspects started following him, according to police. The victim was attacked at the intersection of Gay Street and Jackson Avenue. He was treated and later released from Baptist Hospital of East Tennessee.
<P>   Pressley said officers saw the suspects inside the truck a short time later on Magnolia Avenue. A pursuit ensued. It ended on Beaumont Avenue, where the suspects were captured, Pressley said. The gun used in the crime was later found. A report on the incident had not been filed Sunday night, so the victim&#39;s identity was not available.

<P><h3>Doctors upgrade condition of Ray from serious to fair</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>    NASHVILLE -- Doctors on Sunday upgraded the medical condition of convicted assassin James Earl Ray from serious to fair.
<P>    Doctors have declined to comment on what he&#39;s suffering from, but his brother Jerry Ray said Ray is in the final stages of cirrhosis of the liver. At one point last week, Ray, 68, was in a coma and appeared near death.
<P>   Ray is serving a 99-year sentence for the slaying of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who was shot to death in Memphis in 1968. Ray confessed to the killing but has been trying to recant ever since.

		<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>f shoppers didn&#39;t spot sale signs before Christmas, they&#39;ll find them now.
<P>    Stores and malls were slashing prices today, hoping for a burst of post-Christmas buying.
<P>    From major retailers to small independent stores, merchants were opening early and offering deep discounts to get shoppers into the buying mood again after a 24-hour respite.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s a big day,&#39;&#39; said John Costello, senior executive vice president at Sears, Roebuck & Co., which was discounting everything from Craftsman tools to cordless telephones during its traditional after-holiday sale.
<P>    Despite reports of brisk buying in the first weeks of the season, retailers in some areas report being affected by maxxed-out credit cards, foul weather and five fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. &#39;&#39;Was it great? No,&#39;&#39; said Robert Burton, director of investor relations at Kmart Corp. &#39;&#39;We saw a modest improvement this Christmas and retailers in general had to work hard to get the gains they had.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Now, storeowners are betting on a surge of buying to help their bottom lines. For shoppers, that could mean good deals on things they didn&#39;t get for Christmas. Some merchants are offering discounts as high as 75 percent.
<P>    Some of the best prices were expected to be found at electronics and computer stores, which suffered through one of their toughest holiday seasons in recent years due to waning demand.
<P>    Apparel, too, will likely go on sale, as clothing stores try to move out merchandise to make room for new goods. These markdowns come despite a successful season for apparel retailers, who thrived thanks to a rebounding interest in clothing.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Apparel was up stronger than anticipated,&#39;&#39; said Walter Loeb, who runs the retail consulting firm Loeb Associates. &#39;&#39;Everything was selling and anything tied to clothes was selling -- ties, accessories, handbags.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Other big winners this Christmas included jewelry stores and upscale retailers, with many shoppers willing to spend a little more on gifts. Toy retailers had a strong year, benefiting from the frenzy over Tickle Me Elmo and Holiday Barbie dolls and Nintendo 64 video games.
<P>    Home furnishings also sold well, especially smaller pieces like wine racks and end tables. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s the Martha Stewart syndrome,&#39;&#39; said Clark Johnson, chief executive of Pier 1 Imports. &#39;&#39;People interested in their homes again.&#39;&#39;

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>August 25, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>THESE COUNTRY STYLISTS SURVIVE 
WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF AIRPLAY </h2>
<p><em>By Wayne Bledsoe, News-Sentinel music writer</em></p>
<p>While many modern country artists seem to come from some Nashville 
machine that spits out pretty boys and girls with voices that sound nearly the 
same, there are still plenty of stylists around -- they're just having a little 
trouble getting airplay for their new records.</p>
<p>George Jones</p>
<p>The king of country singers is George Jones, and Jones is finally back with a 
collection of songs worthy of his talent. ``I Lived To Tell It All'' (MCA) 
features songs that seem (and probably were) tailor-made for Jones. In fact, 
the kickoff track, ``Honky Tonk Song,'' documents the time Jones rode his 
lawn mower out for a drink when his wife took away his car keys. It's a fun 
track in his classic honky-tonk style.</p>
<p>The cuts on the album give Jones a chance to display why he's become a 
legend. There's heartbreak (``I Must Have Done Something Bad,'' ``Tied to 
a Stone,'' ``Hundred Proof Memories''), sweet sentimentality (``It Ain't 
Gonna Worry My Mind'') and great drinking songs (``Honky Tonk Song,'' 
``The Lone Ranger'').</p>
<p>Bobby Braddock, co-author of ``He Stopped Loving Her Today,'' 
contributes the novelty track ``Billy B. Bad,'' a fun saga of a no-account, 
trendy young country singer who strikes it big but ``tests positive for 
Branson'' before the song is over. Jones, burned by country radio's embrace 
of just the sort of guys the song is about, sings it with relish.</p>
<p>Jones still bends notes and slides around melodies like a human steel guitar. 
This is his best disc in more than a decade.</p>
<p>Randy Travis</p>
<p>Travis is the only modern country singer who can compare with Jones. No 
one else has such control and can put so much feeling into a song. 
Unfortunately, Travis' new album, ``Full Circle'' (Warner Bros.), suffers from 
a lack of exactly what Jones' new release has in such abundance.</p>
<p>Anything featuring Travis' voice can't help but sound good. He's a vocal 
master. He soars and dives and wraps his voice around a song with 
disarming ease. Yet it's frustrating to listen to such a powerful instrument 
used to perform such lackluster songs. It's a particular shame considering 
that Travis' last album, the undeservedly overlooked ``This Is Me,'' was his 
best since he turned country radio on its antenna in the '80s.</p>
<p>The best tunes on ``Full Circle'' -- the Travis co-written ``I Can Almost 
Hear Her Wings'' and Mark Knopfler's ``Are We In Trouble Now'' -- are 
no more than pleasant trifles. Even Travis' pretty cover of Roger Miller's 
classic ``King of the Road'' seems hobbled by its company.</p>
<p>Billy Joe Shaver</p>
<p>Shaver, on the other hand, continues his winning streak with his new disc, 
``Highway of Life'' (Justice).</p>
<p>Shaver is best known for his 1970s classic songs, including ``Old Chunk of 
Coal'' and ``Honky Tonk Heroes.''</p>
<p>Shaver, accompanied by his son Eddy on guitar, blasted back onto the 
scene in the '90s with the loud and raucous discs ``Tramp on Your Street'' 
and ``Unshaven: Live at Smith's Olde Bar.'' ``Highway of Life'' is a gentle 
and slower-to-appreciate effort compared with those releases.</p>
<p>Eddy's fiery guitar is toned down, and Billy Joe's voice expresses more 
emotion and sometimes shows more strain. His vocals on ``The First and 
Last Time'' and on his 1970 song ``Goodbye Yesterday'' have the rawness 
of midnight demos. Other tracks, including ``Look for Me When You See 
Me Comin','' have Billy Joe melding perfectly in a full acoustic band.</p>
<p>The only time Shaver rocks out is on ``Muther Trucker,'' a hot track hidden 
behind track one, but even it is toned down from Shaver's other '90s work. 
Still, loud or quiet, Shaver is a talent to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>David Ball</p>
<p>Ball may be the most distinctive country vocalist to emerge in the '90s. His 
voice has the reedy nasal twang of Webb Pierce without ever seeming like 
an imitation. When Ball manages to win some radio airplay, he can't be 
mistaken for anyone else.</p>
<p>It's taken Ball two years to record a follow-up to his hit album ``Thinkin' 
Problem,'' but ``Starlite Lounge'' (Warner Bros.) was worth the wait. Ball's 
music is still hard-core honky-tonk with a folksy element tossed in, but 
``Starlite Lounge'' contains a better collection of songs. ``Bad Day for the 
Blues,'' ``If You'd Like Some Lovin','' and ``Hangin' In and Hangin' On'' are 
as catchy as songs get.</p>
<p>Ball wrote or co-wrote all but one of the songs on the disc (a rarity for 
young country performers), and they're all solid tunes. And co-producers Ed 
Seay and Steve Buckingham keep the arrangements bright and crisp.</p>
<p>While none of the songs on the album are classics, Ball may be the country 
artist to carry the traditional torch into the next century.</p>
<p>Grade: A (George Jones); C (Randy Travis); A- (Shaver); A- (David Ball)</p>
<p>Remembering Dean</p>
<p>When Dean Martin died last year, very few of his recordings were available 
to remember just what a likable vocalist he was. Martin's 1960s Reprise 
Records work is still missing in action, but Capitol Records has begun 
reissuing some of Martin's best '50s work.</p>
<p>``The Capitol Years'' and ``The Best of Dean Martin'' both span the years 
that made Martin a recording star.</p>
<p>Both include the essential hits ``That's Amore,'' ``You're Nobody Till 
Somebody Loves You'' and ``Memories Are Made of This.'' Yet what 
makes the 40-track ``Capitol Years'' far more interesting than the 20-track 
``Best of'' are such gems as a live medley recorded at a 1959 benefit 
concert, a duet with Nat King Cole (``Open Up the Doghouse'') and several 
fine previously unreleased and rare recordings.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a better representation of Martin and his Bing Crosby-influenced 
crooning.</p>
<p>The real prize, though, is ``Sleep Warm,'' a concept album of ``lullabies for 
moderns'' with an orchestra arranged by Pete King and conducted by Frank 
Sinatra. Martin's warm warble wraps itself around songs -- including 
``Dream,'' ``Hit the Road to Dreamland,'' ``Goodnight, My Love'' and 
``Sleepy Time Gal'' -- with perfect ease.</p>
<p>It's one of Martin's most natural-sounding, relaxed and best recordings.</p>
<p>Grade: A (``Sleep Warm''); A- (``Capitol Years,'' ``Best of'')</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>September 1, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>WITH ONE SHOW, SQUIRREL NUT 
ZIPPERS FOUND ITS HOT JAZZ SOUND </h2>
<p><em>By Wayne Bledsoe, News-Sentinel entertainment writer</em></p>
<p>Sometimes music has a will of its own. </p>
<p>Take the case of the Squirrel Nut Zippers. Hearing the band is like being 
jerked into the hot jazz days of the late '20s. Trumpets, clarinets, 
saxophones, ukuleles and banjos blast out fun music that swings like the 
pendulum of a grandfather clock on a ship at sea. It's fun. It's energetic. 
And, it's just about the last thing you'd expect to hear from a group of 
musicians in their 20s and 30s. </p>
<p>``We didn't set out to do this,'' says Zipper co-founder Jim Mathus from the 
Efland, N.C., home he shares with his wife, Zipper vocalist and co-founder 
Katherine Whalen. </p>
<p>``You know, we just did one show, and people just flipped over it!'' says 
Mathus. </p>
<p>That first show was in a small basement club in Chapel Hill, N.C., but the 
scene has been repeated all over the United States. The Zippers, who will 
play two shows at the Laurel Theater on Friday, have just completed a 
mostly sold-out tour of the West Coast. And the group is selling 2,000 
copies a week of ``HOT,'' their new CD from Mammoth Records. </p>
<p>Mathus says the group has occasionally been accused of being ``punk 
rockers trying to ape a musical tradition,'' but that's completely off the mark. </p>
<p>``We can't help it. This is what we do,'' says Mathus. ``You sit down with 
any of us, and you'll find out that we know this music -- and we'll talk about 
it for hours.'' </p>
<p>Mathus grew up in Mississippi in a family that loved and played bluegrass. 
His own record collection had Bill Monroe snuggled up next to the Sex 
Pistols and John Prine sharing space with the Cramps. Mathus played punk 
songs on his guitar and picked bluegrass with relatives. </p>
<p>``I always loved any kind of good music,'' he says. </p>
<p>Mathus moved to New Orleans where he began picking up on traditional 
jazz. Later, he moved to Chapel Hill to start a band. He also met Whalen, 
who was a painter and an artist, and the two eventually married. </p>
<p>While Mathus formed a rock band called Metal Flake Mother, he also 
began checking out radio station WYXC-FM, which played swing music at 
night. </p>
<p>In addition, he began tracking down records at junk shops and record 
stores, a habit he still has. </p>
<p>``I look at a record and if it says it was recorded in, say, 1928 or 1938, I 
buy it,'' says Mathus. </p>
<p>He took a particular interest in recordings by the Hot Club of France, which 
featured gypsy guitar great Django Reinhardt. </p>
<p>Reinhardt, Fats Waller, Robert Johnson, Fletcher Henderson, Louis 
Armstrong's Hot Five and Hawaiian guitar pioneer Sol Hoopi became some 
of Mathus' favorites. </p>
<p>In 1993, Mathus and Whalen moved to a farm house in Efland where they 
spent time painting, making puppets and listening to old records. Whalen, 
who played the ukulele, began learning the banjo from Mathus. Both had 
become well-known in the local music and arts community. The two began 
gathering like-minded friends for dinner and music-making. </p>
<p>The first recruits were biomedical engineer and bassist Don Raleigh and 
former Democratic party worker and multi-instrumentalist Ken Mosher. 
They later enlisted drummer Chris Phillips, guitarist/vocalist Tom Maxwell 
and trumpeter, former Sex Police member Stacy Guess (since replaced with 
trumpeter Je Widenhouse). </p>
<p>The group played original songs written in the hot jazz style. Mathus, Whalen 
and Maxwell traded vocal chores. </p>
<p>When the band decided to present its creations to the public, word spread 
through the local arts community, and a large crowd turned out. </p>
<p>``At that first show there were people in top hats and tails. They brought 
champagne. So it started out really powerful,'' remembers Mathus. </p>
<p>And since that night, the Squirrel Nut Zippers, whose name was taken from 
an old-fashioned candy snack, haven't looked back. </p>
<p>Mathus says he thinks audiences are again ready for bands that deliver 
strong melodies, good musicianship, articulate singing, happy songs and who 
dress stylishly. </p>
<p>``I think people are just ready to get down and have a good time,'' he says. </p>
<p><strong>Music news</strong> </p>
<p>* Is Knoxville ready? The Opposable Thumbs' CD, ``Opposable Thumbs 
Are Ready for Love,'' will be released on Friday, Sept. 6. </p>
<p>The Thumbs consist of longtime Knoxville music scene veterans, Todd 
Steed, Dave Jenkins and Paul Noe. </p>
<p>Songs on the disc include: ``Hangover Over,'' ``I Was a Geek,'' ``Astronaut 
Needs His Space'' and ``John Ward.'' The disc was recorded over the past 
two years at Knoxville's Disgraceland Studios. </p>
<p>An album release party and concert will be held at 10 p.m. Friday at the 
Mercury Theatre. State Champs will open the show, and the CD will be 
available for $10. </p>
<p>After Friday, the disc will be available by mail and at local record stores. To 
order by mail send a check or money order for $14 to: P.O. Box 16044, 
Knoxville, TN 37996. </p>
<p>* Anyone at the Chieftains' recent show at the Tennessee Theater would 
surely delight in recalling opening act Ashley MacIsaac, the supercharged 
Canadian fiddler. Fans of MacIsaac will get a chance to him as a headliner 
at 8 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 24, at the Bijou Theatre. Tickets go on sale Friday, 
Sept. 6. </p>
<p>* Knoxville-based rock success Superdrag is showing up in all sorts of 
music publications. The group has landed features in Spin, Rolling Stone and 
now in Billboard. With the group's single ``Sucked Out'' now at No. 21 on 
the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, Superdrag is featured in a 
Billboard column, Modern Age. </p>

<font size=-1>WHO: David Hasselhoff<br>
WHEN: 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. today<br>
WHERE: Homer Hamilton Theater, Tennessee Valley Fair<br>
TICKETS: Free with fair admission. Hasselhoff will also make an appearance from 1 to 4 p.m. today at Walgreens, 8950 Kingston Pike.<br></font>

<p><i>By Wayne Bledsoe, News-Sentinel entertainment writer</i><P>

   It's 6:30 a.m., California time. David Hasselhoff is driving to a ``Baywatch'' shooting.<P>

    Hasselhoff is the star and executive producer of ``Baywatch,'' called ``the Most Popular Television in the History of the Planet'' by Entertainment Weekly, and the show's spin-off ``Baywatch Nights.'' He is also a recording star in Europe, with a big enough following to fill arenas.<P>

   Why then, is Hasselhoff performing his music at county fairs?<P>

   ``It's a start in America,'' he answers on his car phone. ``You gotta get some roots somewhere . . . In Europe, I have four platinum albums. Here, they don't know I have any.''<P>

   In Europe, having a hit TV show is a plus when it comes to having your music played on the radio. In the United States, it's just the opposite. Hasselhoff says playing at venues such as the Tennessee Valley Fair, where he performs today, is a chance to get his music to middle America -- the same people who listen to country music watch ``Baywatch'' and in the '90s watched his show ``Knight Rider.''<P>

   ``So I put my name in the pot and had a good response,'' says Hasselhoff of his booking success at fairs around the country.<P>

    It's certainly a less risky way to get his music heard in America than his venture in June 1994 when he performed a heavily promoted Pay-Per-View concert at Trump's Castle in Atlantic City. As Hasselhoff was singing his heart out, O.J. Simpson was driving around Los Angeles being chased by police.<P>

   ``I got off the stage, and (Donald) Trump said, `Hey, your buddy O.J.'s on TV!' And I said, `First, he's not my buddy, and second, what do you mean?' ''<P>

   Trump directed Hasselhoff to the TV where the white Bronco was crawling along the freeways of L.A.<P>

   ``I said, `Is this live? . . . Give me something very big to drink!' ''<P>

    The experience gave him a new definition for Pay-Per-View:. ``I paid; nobody viewed.''<P>

    Still, that seems a relatively small bit of bad luck, considering Hasselhoff's knack of beating the odds.<P>

   A native of Baltimore, Md., Hasselhoff first caught the public's notice during a six-year stint as Snapper on the daytime soap opera ``The Young and the Restless.'' He then jumped ship to become the star of ``Knight Rider,'' which featured a talking car. The show aired from 1982 to '86. In '89, ``Baywatch'' premiered on NBC but was canceled after one season. Hasselhoff revived the show for syndication in '91, and it is now seen in 140 countries.<P>

    So, exactly why is ``Baywatch'' such a phenomenon?<P>

   Hasselhoff has several explanations.<P>

   ``The world likes `Baywatch' because they look at America as the lifeguards of the world,'' he says. ``And there's the weather. There's two seasons in Europe -- winter and July. Think about people in Finland. It's great to watch a show with warm beaches and sun. Basically, we're just taking what the Beach Boys did (musically) and putting visuals to it.''<P>

   Then, too, there's a lot more visual on the show than sand.<P>

   ``I am aware that a lot of our audience is boys between the age of 8 and 15, who tune in to fantasize about being with Pamela Lee,'' says Hasselhoff. ``When I was a kid I had fantasies like that, too.''<P>

    He insists the show offers more than just jiggle, noting that he comes ``from the Michael Landon school of TV'' and promotes stories that are uplifting and stress that ``one man can make a difference.''<P>

   Hasselhoff is proud of the awards ``Baywatch'' has won for using handicapped actors and involving physical disabilities in plotlines, plus an award from the American Red Cross because the show teaches and promotes life-saving.<P>

   Yet, he still smarts from the flack he took in the early days of the show.<P>

   ``When `Baywatch' started getting legs in America, critics were all taking potshots at it,'' he says. ``Now everyone's begging me to come on their show.''<P>

   He says he tried to take the early jabs with good humor, but the jokes didn't stop. Jay Leno later apologized for his quips, but Hasselhoff is still bitter toward Letterman, who he says has ragged him mercilessly.<P>

   ``After a while you wanna go, `Shut up, you little putz!' '' says Hasselhoff.<P>

   Tabloids also had a field day with Hasselhoff and anyone attatched to ``Baywatch.''<P>

   ``Then they stopped attacking me and started going after my wife,'' he says.<P>

   Hasselhoff says he is suing one tabloid over a story on his wife, although he declines to give details as to the story in dispute.<P>

   ``Baywatch Nights,'' which features Hasselhoff's ``Baywatch'' character, Mitch Buchannon, moonlighting as a detective, has also taken some barbs.<P>

    Hasselhoff says the ratings for the first year of ``Baywatch Nights'' were ``not great,'' but they were better than the first season of ``Baywatch.'' However, the show has been retooled with a supernatural slant for its second season.<P>

   ``It's more like `The Night Stalker' than the `X-Files,' '' says Hasselhoff, adding that the show will feature a very different visual look by using hand-held cameras, 16-millimeter film and atmospheric lighting.<P>

    Hasselhoff doesn't seem too worried the show, even if it doesn't become successful. He has other things on his mind.<P>

   He enjoys spending time with his two daughters and his wife, Pamela Bach Hasselhoff, and has cut back his on-screen time in both ``Baywatch'' shows to allow himself more time at home. He also enjoys meeting the public and will make an appearance from 1 and 4 p.m. today at Walgreens on Kingston Pike as part of a promotion for Chantal Skin Care products.<P>

   In addition, he is planning a world tour in the spring of 1997. He's also completed a TV movie, called ``Gridlock,'' and has had talks about starring in a second ``Knight Rider'' movie.<P>

   At this point, he says, ``I'm just waiting to see what's behind door No. 2.''<P>

		<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->&#39;&#39;Everybody Knows,&#39;&#39; Trisha Yearwood (MCA)
<P>   Trisha Yearwood has one of the finest voices in modern country music. But, more important than having an excellent voice, Yearwood knows exactly how to pick a good song and then how to sell it to her audience. She knows when to take it down to a whisper and when to crank it up to a shout.
<P>   And, unlike many in the business, Yearwood sings with emotion that never seems forced or unnatural.
<P>   Yearwood&#39;s new album, &#39;&#39;Everybody Knows,&#39;&#39; is one of her finest moments to date.
<P>   Working with her longtime producer, Garth Fundis, Yearwood has constructed an album that hooks by both its construction and its content. It contains a collection of top-notch songs that flow seamlessly from one to the next. The up-tempo opening track, &#39;&#39;I Want To Live Again,&#39;&#39; slides into the mid-tempo, Latin-flavored &#39;&#39;It&#39;s Alright&#39;&#39; (with good harmonies by Mavericks singer Raul Malo), followed by the jangly guitar-filled &#39;&#39;Believe Me Baby (I Lied)&#39;&#39; and the achingly pretty ballad &#39;&#39;I Need You.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;Under the Rainbow&#39;&#39; by Matraca Berg and Randy Scruggs is a sweet and spunky tune about long-term romance. &#39;&#39;Everybody Knows,&#39;&#39; also co-written by Berg, is a well-crafted number about dealing with a romance that didn&#39;t last.
<P>   Vince Gill weighs in on the high harmonies on &#39;&#39;Maybe It&#39;s Love.&#39;&#39; Yearwood ties up the disc with a sparse and bluesy rendition of &#39;&#39;A Lover Is Forever&#39;&#39; by Fred Knobloch and the late Steve Goodman.
<P>   This is an album that doesn&#39;t seem to pander to radio or audience prejudices in its production. Yearwood and Fundis seem to be working with vision, unlike many Nashville artists who are producing cookie-cutter-quality work.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Everybody Knows&#39;&#39; is Yearwood&#39;s best disc since &#39;&#39;Hearts in Armor&#39;&#39; and is one of the best discs of 1996.

<P>&#39;&#39;Santiago,&#39;&#39; The Chieftains (BMG Classics)
<P>   Since the early &#39;60s, the Chieftains have helped spread Celtic music around the world. On &#39;&#39;Santiago,&#39;&#39; the band traces the path Celtic music took as it spread through the Hispanic world centuries before the Chieftains began performing.
<P>   The journey begins in Galicia, an area of northwest Spain that has a traditional music that sounds more akin to music from Ireland, Scotland and England than other music from Spain (there is even a Galician bagpipe). Then, through mostly traditional folk tunes, the band traces the routes of Galician immigrants into Mexico, Cuba and other Spanish-settled areas, exposing a Celtic element that persisted in the music.
<P>   While all of the disc is enchanting, with Spanish guitars mixing with tin whistles, pipes and other traditional instruments, the album&#39;s centerpiece is the beautiful, 11-minute &#39;&#39;Galician Overture,&#39;&#39; composed by Chieftains leader Paddy Moloney.
<P>   The album is awash with musicians from Galicia and U.S. artists Linda Ronstadt, Ry Cooder and Los Lobos, but the real stars are the Chieftains themselves, who make &#39;&#39;Santiago&#39;&#39; a special journey.

<P>&#39;&#39;Brain Salad Surgery,&#39;&#39; Emerson, Lake & Palmer (Rhino)
<P>   &#39;&#39;How do you spell pretentious? -- E-L-P.&#39;&#39; That&#39;s how the old joke went in the &#39;70s. Yet, to many of us growing up in that decade, they seemed, well . . . progressive. Keith Emerson&#39;s synthesizer wailed out a myriad of new sounds, drummer Carl Palmer hit giant gongs, and singer Greg Lake sang lyrics that seemed so serious that they must&#39;ve been deep.
<P>   Rhino Records recently has remastered Emerson, Lake & Palmer&#39;s entire catalog for CD. While many of the albums are easy to pass by, anyone who came of age during the &#39;70s would be hard pressed not to pick up the deluxe edition of the group&#39;s pinnacle, &#39;&#39;Brain Salad Surgery.&#39;&#39; First, there&#39;s that cool cover by H.R. Giger (who later designed the creature in &#39;&#39;Alien&#39;&#39;). The original cover was a gatefold design. The Rhino deluxe CD contains a jewel-box that can be tilted to reveal the inner or the outer cover.
<P>   The music presents the group at its grandiose best, highlighted by &#39;&#39;Karn Evil 9,&#39;&#39; which took up all of side two, way back when albums had to be turned over. When Lake shouts, &#39;&#39;Welcome back my friend to the show that never ends!&#39;&#39; you can&#39;t help but get a few warm flashbacks.

<h3>''A Worm's Life,'' Crash Test Dummies (Arista) </h3>
<p>The Crash Test Dummies' ''Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm'' was 1994's 
most enigmatic, improbable and welcome hit. In his deep bass voice, 
singer-songwriter Brad Roberts told the stories of a grade school outcast in 
a song punctuated by a chorus of nothing more than Roberts' non-commital 
humming. </p>
<p>''God Shuffled His Feet,'' the album that features ''Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm 
Mmm,'' is a finely-tooled collection of quirky pop, produced by former 
Talking Head Jerry Harrison. </p>
<p>The self-produced ''A Worm's Life'' is the Canadian band's third disc, and it 
seems more like pages torn from Brad Roberts' notebook and put to music. 
It's a homier, sometimes less catchy, effort that takes a little more time to 
warm up to. </p>
<p>While the instrumentalists propel the disc along with friendly riffs, it's 
Roberts' vocals and songs that are the Dummies' selling points. </p>
<p>In a style that is more diarist than poet, Roberts creates songs that are equal 
parts Jean Paul Sartre, Richard Brautigan and Zen parables. </p>
<p>He picks out odd memories, such as a first grade teacher who embalmed 
birds (''Swatting Flies'') and a boy who enjoyed having his teeth pulled out 
(''He Liked to Feel It''). </p>
<p>He contemplates mortality (''I'm Outlived By That Thing''); the dangers that 
lie in seemingly innocuous objects (''There Are Many Dangers''); and the 
sometimes tragic nature of getting what you long for (''Overachievers''). </p>
<p>On ''An Old Scab,'' Roberts tells how manic depressive composer Robert 
Schumann would get down on his knees and pray for help when he suffered 
writer's block. </p>
<p>The song concludes: ''It's not as bad as eating your own liver; but still, I'd 
like to think there are better methods.'' </p>
<p>All these tales leave the listener with a chuckle and a particularly 
uncomfortable feeling. </p>
<p>Like existentialist Sartre, there's a search for meaning where there is none. 
Like absurdist hippie favorite Brautigan, there's a joke on anyone who 
attempts to take it too seriously. And, like a Zen parable, the lack of 
resolution can leave you pondering for the rest of the night. </p>
<p>Grade: B+ </p>
<h3>Keeping up with Sam Bush </h3>
<p>Why did it take Sam Bush 13 years to put out a second solo album? </p>
<p>''I waited till I had something to say,'' says Bush from his Nashville home. </p>
<p>Well, Bush actually has had a lot to say through the years, just not on his 
own projects. Now he's speaking up for himself again with the new disc 
''Glamour &amp; Grits.'' </p>
<p>The master mandolinist/fiddler founded New Grass Revival in the '70s. Since 
the band's break-up in '87, he has busied himself by touring and recording in 
band configurations with several fellow acoustic music masters; acting as a 
session musician; performing with Emmylou Harris' back-up band, the Nash 
Ramblers; and touring with Lyle Lovett and Bela Fleck and the Flecktones. </p>
<p>Bush will perform at 8 p.m. Friday, Oct. 18, at the Bijou. His band will 
feature guitarist Darrell Scott, drummer Larry Atamanuik and former New 
Grass bassist-vocalist John Cowan (who provides background vocals on 
''Glamour &amp; Grits''). </p>
<p>Bush says he was so happy with his many musical endeavors that he didn't 
feel that he had to make a solo record. However, Sugar Hill Records owner 
(and Bush fan) Barry Poss exerted a little pressure on the musician by 
printing up ''Bush in '96'' bumper stickers. </p>
<p>Bush says he's more comfortable playing in band situations than when his 
name is at the top of the venue. He says he is glad to have his old friend 
Cowan playing with him. </p>
<p>''It's a comforting sight and sound to have him there,'' says Bush. The two 
will probably sing a couple of New Grass standards before Friday's concert 
is over, he says. </p>
<p>Other memories of New Grass were brought back at a recent tribute 
concert Bush organized for Courtney Johnson, the original New Grass 
banjo-player who died earlier this year. </p>
<p>The concert was held at the Ryman Auditorium and included Johnson's 
friends and the cream of acoustic music. Norman and Nancy Blake, Doc 
Watson and Jack Lawrence, Ricky Skaggs, Hot Rize, Chesapeake, Fleck, 
Cowan and fellow New Grass alumnus Curtis Burch all performed. </p>
<p>''It was a very moving and touching experience,'' says Bush. ''There was 
such an outpouring of affection from all the other artists.'' </p>
<p>Bush was also affected by the death of bluegrass father Bill Monroe, whom 
he calls ''the most influential musician in my life.'' </p>
<p>''Selfishly speaking, I miss my mandolin hero,'' he says. ''He and Jethro 
(Burns) are both gone . . . I guess I have to grow up now.'' </p>
<h3>Music news </h3>
<p>* The Jazz Exchange Organization, at the Moses Center, 220 Carrick 
Street, will have a grand opening celebration from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on 
Saturday, Nov. 2. </p>
<p>The celebration will include performances by some of Knoxville's best jazz 
artists, including Harold Nagge, the UT Jazz Giants, the Bill Scarlett Quintet 
and Early Bird. The event will begin with a Knoxville version of the photo 
session ''A Great Day in Harlem.'' Local jazz greats will pose for a group 
portrait. </p>
<p>The event will close with a jam session for hot young talents. </p>

different paths, but each finishes 
in a jam</b></font><br>
<!--SUBHEAD--><p><font size=2><i>By Wayne Bledsoe News-Sentinel entertainment writer</i></font> </p>
<p><!--dateline--><br>
<font size=5>W</font>hat do you get when you mix Widespread Panic with Leftover Salmon? </p>
<p>For the answer, catch the two popular jam bands when they perform at 7:30 
p.m. Monday and Tuesday at the Tennessee Theater. </p>
<p>While both bands love to jam (thus inspiring their fans to call themselves 
''Salmonheads'' and ''Spreadheads''), the groups come from different places, 
both musically and geographically. Salmon hails from Boulder, Colo., and 
uses bluegrass as a jumping-off point. Panic hails from Athens, Ga., and has 
one foot rooted in rhythm and blues. </p>
<p>Representatives of both bands took time last week to talk with me. </p>
<p>''Sometimes people use the word zany to describe us,'' says Salmon 
singer-guitarist Vince Herman. ''We're steadfastly holding to not being zany. 
Ridiculous, funny, that's fine, but no 'zany.' '' </p>
<p>OK. Not zany. But why does a group that promotes itself as ''polyethnic 
Cajun slamgrass'' choose a name that indicates something that might smell 
really bad or even give you food poisoning? </p>
<p>Is it a clever way of saying ''funky,'' as in the oldest definition of the word? </p>
<p>''That's a good one,'' says Herman from a pay phone at a Boulder grocery 
store. </p>
<p>''I haven't heard that one before. No, it's just one of those things that sticks in 
your head and your nose. . . It's just a lesson to be careful when you name a 
band.'' </p>
<p>The name actually came from the names of the two Boulder bands that 
Leftover Salmon evolved from -- the Left Hand String Band and the Salmon 
Heads. </p>
<p>Seven years ago, when a couple of members couldn't make a Salmon Heads 
gig, two members of the Left Hand Band were asked to fill in. A bond was 
formed, along with a name that strikes fear in the hearts of refrigerators 
everywhere. </p>
<p>A Pittsburgh native, Herman became a bluegrass fan in his late teens after a 
friend played him a tape by mandolin wizard David Grisman. </p>
<p>''I just lost my mind,'' says Herman. ''And my Rush albums didn't get put on 
the turntable much after that.'' </p>
<p>Herman moved to Boulder because he'd heard there was a thriving bluegrass 
scene there. </p>
<p>''I drove into town, walked into a bar, and the Left Hand String Band was 
playing,'' he says. </p>
<p>Ironically, it was the Salmon Heads that he joined, but the two bands often 
crossed paths. </p>
<p>Herman says that although the fusion of the two bands resulted in a music 
with a bluegrassy feel, Leftover Salmon rarely performed in bluegrass 
venues. </p>
<p>''We kinda came out of left field,'' he says. ''We'd play rock 'n' roll venues, 
and people who like bluegrass would show up and say, 'Hey, there's a little 
bluegrass here.' '' </p>
<p>He says even when the group does play a bluegrass festival, audiences give 
them very little flak over their wild musical conglomeration. </p>
<p>''We must have the right haircuts,'' says Herman. ''And, we don't take 
ourselves too seriously.'' </p>
<p>You get the feeling that concert headliners Widespread Panic are a little 
more serious. </p>
<p>''We don't shoot off fireworks,'' says John Bell, guitarist and lead singer for 
Widespread Panic. ''In fact, some of us barely move.'' </p>
<p>The Athens, Ga.-based band may be slightly static onstage, their music 
seeks to plug into some spiritual ether. </p>
<p>Over the past decade, Widespread Panic has built a dedicated cult for its 
long jams and songs that never sound the same way twice. </p>
<p>The group has recorded four albums on Capricorn Records (including the 
recent ''Ain't Life Grand'') and collaborated with songwriter Vic Chesnutt 
and recorded one album under the name Brute. </p>
<p>Bell, speaking from a hotel in Jackson, Miss., says being a vocalist in an 
improvisational group requires receiving mental images and being able to 
report on them. </p>
<p>''Vocally, I feel it's my responsibility to report accurately on the images 
coming through. Any of that make sense to you?'' </p>
<p>Uh, kind of. </p>
<p>''It's the only way I can imagine doing it,'' says Bell. ''. . . It's very much a 
receiving thing. I can see it, but I can't always tap into it.'' </p>
<p>It makes a little more sense when Bell cites as inspirations Van Morrison and 
Carlos Santana, two artists who occasionally seem to lapse into musical 
trances. </p>
<p>Yet, Widespread Panic does recognize the power of pop hooks and solid 
songs. And, Bell says some aspects of Panic's show are less serendipitous 
than they used to be. </p>
<p>In fact, the six band members used to be insistent about going onstage 
without a set list. </p>
<p>''We did that for the first eight or nine years,'' says Bell. ''But we'd end up 
spending 15 extra seconds deliberating over what the next song would be, 
and that's just giving it too much thought and taking too long.'' </p>
<p>Now the group decides 30 minutes before going onstage what the list for the 
first half of the show will be. They decide during intermission what will be 
played in the second half. </p>
<p>Audiences can expect to hear favorite songs, although probably in different 
forms than they appear on Panic albums. </p>
<p>''It's like that movie 'Groundhog Day,' '' says Bell. ''You keep trying to do it

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->        ''Anthology 3,'' The Beatles, (Apple/Capitol) </p>
        <p>''Anthology 3'' is touted to be the final edition of
        the unreleased work by the Beatles -- but don't be too
        sure. </p>
        <p>''Anthology 3'' is a satisfying glimpse of the band
        working on their final three albums, ''The Beatles''
        (better known as ''The White Album''), ''Let It Be'' and
        ''Abbey Road.'' Like the two previous two-disc
        ''Anthology'' collections, the third set is full of
        demos, jams, flawed and alternate takes and a few
        completed tracks that were left off albums. </p>
        <p>The completed tracks include a pretty orchestral
        arrangement that producer George Martin had composed as
        an introduction to the song ''Don't Pass Me By'' and John
        Lennon's ''What's the New Mary Jane,'' a fun experimental
        number along the lines of ''You Know My Name (Look Up the
        Number).'' And, Paul McCartney's demo for ''Come and Get
        It,'' a song he gave to the group Badfinger, sounds
        nearly good enough to be considered completed. </p>
        <p>However, the best of the completed songs, ''Not
        Guilty'' and ''I Me Mine,'' belong to George Harrison,
        who was just emerging as a songwriter. The latter, in
        fact, was the last original number that the Beatles
        recorded together. </p>
        <p>At least two tracks on ''Anthology 3'' are credible
        alternative versions of well-known Beatles songs. An
        early take of ''Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da'' features saxophones
        and congas and a denser sound. An early version of ''Glass
        Onion'' includes sound effects, more prominent guitars
        and has no string section. </p>
        <p>While nothing on ''Anthology 3'' is as revealing as
        the evolution of Lennon's masterpiece ''Strawberry Fields
        Forever,'' on ''Anthology 2,'' more casual takes give
        familiar songs a different feel. Lennon's early take of
        ''Cry Baby Cry'' lacks the ominousness of the ''White
        Album'' version. McCartney's ''Blackbird,'' while nearly
        identical to the released version, is sung with more whimsy. </p>
        <p>Proof that the band had fun in the studio is evident
        in jams and song introductions. Lennon and McCartney joke
        with each other before performances of ''Hey Jude,''
        ''Rocky Raccoon'' (with a funny spoken intro by
        McCartney) and ''Step Inside Love/Los Paranoias,'' the
        latter being an impromtu combination of a song McCartney
        wrote for Cilla Black and a tune improvised on the spot. </p>
        <p>Yet, many of the jams and spontaneous bits on
        ''Anthology'' are not actually the Beatles in the raw.
        Many of the cuts have been altered. As on the past two
        ''Anthology'' collections, uncompleted takes are
        sometimes combined (occasionally with the released
        masters) to make songs complete Other times, rehearsal
        tracks are edited down. While that may seem a merciful compromise,
        it sometimes makes the songs seem disingenuous. </p>
        <p>The ''Anthology'' version of ''Helter Skelter'' is a
        five-minute edit of a 12-minute jam. An incomplete
        piano/vocal only version of Ringo Starr singing ''Good
        Night'' has the final master pasted onto the end, instead
        of what the liner notes call an end that ''meandered to
        an indefinite close.'' That indefinite close, though,
        might have held more charm. </p>
        <p>That charm is evidenced in several primitive demos:
        Lennon's versions of ''Mean Mr. Mustard,'' ''Polythene
        Pam,'' and ''Glass Onion''; McCartney's ''Honey Pie'' and
        ''Junk'' (the latter of which turned up with little
        change on McCartney's first solo disc); and Harrison's
        more complete demos for ''Something,'' ''While My Guitar
        Gently Weeps'' and ''All Things Must Pass.'' </p>
        <p>Although ''Anthology 3'' contains 50 tracks, the set's
        liner notes indicate, and bootleg albums prove, that
        there is plenty more unreleased Beatles material.
        Bootlegs include the band jamming on and on during the
        ''Let It Be'' sessions and Donovan stopping by to trade
        songs and anecdotes during the recording of ''The White
        Album.'' That's certainly nothing that the casual fan
        would care to hear, but Beatles fanatics are sure to keep scooping
        it up. Eventually, it may force more of this material to
        be released legitimately. </p>
        <p>Until then, the ''Anthology'' sets provide a nice
        behind-the-scenes look at some of the best-known albums
        in music by the best-known group in history. Grade: B+ </p>

        Me,'' ''Kinda Kinks,'' The Kinks, (Mobile Fidelity Sound
        Lab) </p>
        <p>When the Beatles launched the British Invasion in
        1964, several great bands crossed the Atlantic to become
        stars in America. </p>
        <p>The Beatles and the Rolling Stones became household
        words. Although the scrappy group of Londoners called the
        Kinks didn't reach household-word status, they brandished
        some of the most potent rock 'n' roll of all. </p>
        <p>The band's first hits ''You Really Got Me'' and ''All
        Day and All of the Night'' have been credited as
        prototypes for heavy metal and punk. Lead singer-songwriter
        Ray Davies quickly moved on, writing distinctive songs that
        include ''Sunny Afternoon,'' ''Apeman'' and ''Lola.'' </p>
        <p>Davies became one of the best and most thoughtful
        songwriters in pop music. Period. </p>
        <p>Amazingly, the band has survived, albeit with only Ray
        and guitarist brother Dave Davies remaining from the
        original lineup. </p>
        <p>''To the Bone,'' the group's new album, is a two-disc,
        29-track set, culled from live electric performances and
        an intimate live acoustic recording made at Konk studios
        in London. </p>
        <p>The result is an affectionate overview of the band's
        32-year legacy. </p>
        <p>The Kinks can still crank out loud, raucous rock 'n'
        roll. In addition to the '60s hits, the album includes
        the intelligent head-bangers from the '80s, ''Give the
        People What They Want'' and ''State of Confusion.'' </p>
        <p>However, the biggest prizes on the set are renditions
        of the rarely performed quiet-classics ''Village Green
        Preservation Society,'' ''Picture Book,'' ''Do You
        Remember Walter,'' ''A Gallon of Gas'' and ''See My Friends.'' </p>
        <p>A few of the tracks are even better than the original
        recordings. The voices of the Brothers Davies (especially
        Dave's) have actually improved through the years, and age
        has given the songs added sweetness. </p>
        <p>The set is capped off with two new studio tracks,
        ''Animal'' and ''To the Bone,'' which prove Ray Davies is
        still a writer to be reckoned with. </p>
        <p>Inexplicably, though, while the U.S. version of the
        album betters the one-disc British set by 16 songs, it
        also eliminates two of the British version's best
        numbers, ''Waterloo Sunset'' (possibly Ray's most
        beautiful song) and ''Autumn Almanac.'' </p>
        <p>There's no better place to hear the Kinks' original
        fire than on the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs' original
        master recording editions of the group's first two
        albums, ''You Really Got Me'' and ''Kinda Kinks,''
        re-issued on one disc. </p>
        <p>''You Really Got Me,'' which remains one of the best
        debut rock albums of the early '60s, crackles with raw
        energy. Dave's distorted guitar solo (achieved by
        mutilating a guitar-amp speaker cone) sounds like a revolution.
        And Mobile Fidelity's always pristine remastering makes
        great forgotten numbers, including ''I Took My Baby
        Home'' and ''Stop Your Sobbing,'' sound vibrant and
        fresh. </p>
        <p>''Kinda Kinks'' (presented in mono) is not quite as
        arresting as ''You Really Got Me'' but contains the hit
        ''Tired of Waiting'' and the tune ''So Long,'' which
        hints at the direction that the band would explore in
        later years. </p>
        <p><b>Grade: A </b>(all discs) </p>
        <p>Music news </p>
        <p>* For several years, <b>John &127;Zorn </b>has been
        the grand man of New York's avant garde and experimental
        music scene. </p>
        <p>Most of us know Zorn from his accessible albums ''The
        Big Gundown'' and ''Spillane,'' both inspired by movie
        soundtracks. </p>
        <p>However, fans of jazz, Jewish music and the avant
        garde might consider checking out Zorn's show Tuesday at
        the Bijou Theater. </p>
        <p>In the past few years, Zorn (who doesn't give
        interviews) has begun working on a project called
        ''Masada.'' </p>
        <p>Masada was the legendary mountain fortress that Jewish
        rebels occupied during a battle for independence. The
        rebels committed suicide in 73 A.D. rather than surrender
        to Roman forces. </p>
        <p>On the project, saxophonist Zorn and cohorts <b>Dave
        Douglas</b> (trumpet), <b>Greg Cohen</b> (bass) and<b>
        Joey Baron</b> (drums) use traditional Jewish melodies as
        the jumping-off point for improvisational jazz. The
        result is sort of akin to klezmer music mixed with <b>John
        Coltrane.</b> </p>
        <p>* Knoxville's ''Local Man'' <b>R.B. Morris </b>has
        been signed to <b>John Prine's </b>Oh Boy Records. Morris
        is currently recording an album with producer <b>R.S.
        Field &127;</b>for release in the spring. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->''Dreamland,'' Madeleine Peyroux, (Atlantic) </p>
        <p>Madeleine Peyroux is the current rage among jazz
        vocalists. However, it's not because she is bringing
        something new to jazz. </p>
        <p>Instead, Peyroux (pronounced like the country Peru) is
        causing waves by her vocal similarity to the late, great
        Billie Holiday. Peyroux's debut album, ''Dreamland,''
        displays that the young vocalist has captured Holiday's phrasing
        and vocal nuances perfectly -- so perfectly, in fact,
        that it's a little unnerving. </p>
        <p>That's compounded by Peyroux's choice of material,
        which is either brave or crazy. She covers the signature
        songs of some of music's greatest artists -- ''Walkin'
        After Midnight'' (Patsy Cline), ''La Vie En Rose'' (Edith
        Piaf) and ''I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a
        Letter'' (Fats Waller). She covers two Bessie Smith
        tunes, ''Lovesick Blues'' and ''Reckless Blues,'' and
        even ''(Getting Some) Fun Out of Life,'' which Holiday recorded
        in 1937. </p>
        <p>Producers Yves Beauvais and Greg Cohen assembled some
        of jazz's most creative young lions to accompany the
        singer, including saxophonist James Carter, trumpeter
        Marcus Printup, pianist Cyrus Chestnut, guitarists Marc Ribot
        and Vernon Reid, and Cohen himself on bass. The
        arrangements combine the classic sound of recordings from
        the 1930s with a likable eerieness that recalls work by
        producer Hal Willner. </p>
        <p>The result is thoroughly entertaining with plenty of
        aural charmers, including ''Was I?,'' a '20s-sounding
        number about a young woman's wild night on the town, and
        Peyroux's own sweet ''Dreamland.'' </p>
        <p>Yet, as entertaining as the album is, the nagging
        question remains: Is Peyroux a genuine talent or the
        equivalent of an Elvis imitator for jazz's most soulful
        vocalist? </p>
        <p>The answer may lie in Peyroux's own compositions --
        pretty love songs that blend blues with sweet pop and
        make Peyroux sound more like a woman who has learned from
        Holiday, rather than one who has stolen her soul. With
        luck, Peyroux's own soul will become more evident in the
        coming years. <b>Grade: B</b> </p>
        <p>''Unveiled,'' Marcus Printup, (Blue Note) </p>
        <p>Of all the young trumpet stars, Marcus Printup may be
        the one to keep the closest eye on. On his second album,
        ''Unveiled,'' the Conyers, Ga., native plays with soul
        and style, and his playing has a warmth that sometimes eludes
        his contemporaries. </p>
        <p>Printup, who wrote seven of the 11 tracks on the disc,
        plays jazz that is sweet and moody at one moment, bright
        and sassy the next. He takes cues from Miles Davis'
        late-'50s work (he covers Davis' song ''Dig'') but
        latches onto his own distinctive sound. </p>
        <p>Some of the credit for just how good ''Unveiled'' is
        must go to pianist and producer Marcus Roberts. In an
        appropriate twist, Roberts was first presented to the
        public by trumpet great Wynton Marsalis. Now the pianist provides
        the perfect environment for this young trumpeter and the
        youngest member of the Marsalis clan, Jason, who handles
        drums on the disc. The fine band is rounded out by
        saxophonist Stephen Riley and bassist Rueben Rogers. </p>
        <p>While ''Unveiled'' is loaded with fine tracks,
        stand-outs include ''M &amp; M,'' a fun Printup/Roberts
        duet, and a spiritual version of ''Amazing Grace.'' <b>Grade:
        A</b> </p>
        <p>''The Original James P. Johnson 1942-1945''
        (Smithsonian/Folkways) </p>
        <p>Of all the great piano heroes of jazz, James P.
        Johnson is probably the most overlooked and influential. </p>
        <p>Often called the ''father of the stride piano,''
        Johnson was actually a master of many styles. His
        compositions could be beguilingly complex and listenable
        at the same time. His works included rags and blues; ''Charleston,''
        which inspired a dance craze; compositions for Broadway shows;
        and symphonic works, including ''Yamekraw: A Negro
        Rhapsody,'' which premiered in 1927. Johnson's influence
        can be heard in the work of most jazz piano greats,
        including Duke Ellington, Fats Waller and even Thelonious
        Monk. Unfortunately, much of Johnson's work (recording
        and sheet music), including a complete opera with a
        libretto by Langston Hughes, has been lost. </p>
        <p>''The Original James P. Johnson'' collects solos that
        Johnson recorded for Asch Records in the mid-'40s. While
        the fidelity of the recordings shows some deterioration,
        Johnson's performances are remarkable. He plays inspired
        covers of pop hits, including ''Liza'' and ''Sweet
        Lorraine,'' two different versions of the late-1800s slow
        drag song ''The Dream'' and his own masterful
        compositions. </p>
        <p>Highlights are the sweet ''Daintiness Rag'' and
        ''Twilight Rag,'' but the showstoppers are Johnson's
        extended works, the 11-minute ''Yamekraw'' and the
        six-minute ''Jazzamine Concerto.'' These works hint that
        there was a Gershwin of another color and are proof that
        a true Johnson reappreciation is in order. <b>Grade: A</b> </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->''I don't like to be referred to as a relic,'' says
        Ronnie Dawson. </p>
        <p>Relic, no. Survivor, yes. </p>
        <p>Dawson's brand of rock 'n' roll originated in the
        1950s, and Dawson, who will perform Thursday at the
        Mercury Theatre, insists it never died. Instead, it went
        underground, emerging in England in the early '80s, and
        perhaps again in the United States in the '90s. </p>
        <p>''Back then we never heard the term 'rockabilly' ''
        says Dawson from a Comfort Inn in Portsmouth, N.H. ''It's
        rock 'n' roll. That's exactly what it is.'' </p>
        <p>The 57-year-old rocker made his first recordings in
        the late '50s. He says he has been called a ''comeback''
        artist, but it's not true. </p>
        <p>''It's not a comeback -- it's a never-has-been!'' says
        Dawson. ''This is like a chapter that stayed open waiting
        for something like this to happen.'' </p>
        <p>The chapter began in Waxahachie, Texas, (near Dallas).
        Dawson, whose father was a bass player in a western swing
        band, discovered rock as a teenager. </p>
        <p>''That was just the music of my time,'' Dawson said. </p>
        <p>At first, he heard doo-wop groups, ''but when I heard
        Little Richard I don't think I was ever the same.'' </p>
        <p>Dawson's father taught Ronnie how to play guitar and
        by 1957 the teen had formed the band Ronnie Dee and the D
        Men and earned the nickname ''The Blonde Bomber.'' In
        1958, he recorded his first single on Dallas' tiny Backbeat
        label. The next year, he signed with Swan Records, which
        was owned by ''American Bandstand'' host Dick Clark. </p>
        <p>Stardom seemed inevitable. Unfortunately, just before
        Dawson was to appear on ''Bandstand'' to sing his new
        song ''Ain't That a Kick in the Head,'' the great radio
        payola scandal hit. Clark and most other powerful rock
        disc jockeys were investigated under suspicion of taking
        money from record promoters. As a result, Clark could no
        longer use his show to promote acts signed to his record
        label. </p>
        <p>Some, including Dawson, suspect that the payola
        investigation was primarily an excuse to short-circuit
        rock 'n' roll. </p>
        <p>''It was a blow to the whole business,'' says Dawson.
        ''And payola never stopped. It's still going on.'' </p>
        <p>Rock 'n' roll, though, nearly didn't keep going.
        Raucous rockers like Dawson were replaced by teen-idol
        crooners, such as Frankie Avalon and Bobby Rydell. </p>
        <p>Dawson began recording country music under various
        names. Also, he performed with the Light Crust Doughboys
        and the Levee Singers and worked as a session musician. </p>
        <p>In the late '60s, Dawson formed a band that blended
        rock and country music. The band tried to get a recording
        contract. </p>
        <p>''The bass player took a tape to L.A., and I took one
        to Nashville,'' remembers Dawson. ''In L.A. they said we
        were too country. In Nashville they said we were too
        rock. It was then we knew we had done something different.'' </p>
        <p>The band, however, didn't stay together. Dawson formed
        another, but with less enthusiasm. </p>
        <p>In the '70s, Austin, Texas, became a hotbed for
        alternative country music, but Dawson says it was a
        little too ''laid back'' for him. ''When you're too laid
        back to tune your instruments or keep in time -- you're
        too laid back,'' he says. </p>
        <p>Dawson made ends meet by doing voice-overs and songs
        in commercials. </p>
        <p>All the while, Dawson's old music was being
        discovered. ''Shockabilly'' group the Cramps recorded a
        version of Dawson's ''Rockin' Bones.'' In 1986, English
        record collector Barney Koumis contacted Dawson to tell him
        that his songs were becoming legendary. </p>
        <p>Koumis asked if he could release Dawson's music on an
        album. Dawson not only agreed but ended up recording a
        new album in England. </p>
        <p>In England, Dawson found a group of players who loved
        '50s rock 'n' roll. </p>
        <p>''Some of them knew more about my music than I did,''
        marvels Dawson. ''It was almost like I had known them in
        another life.'' </p>
        <p>Dawson proved he still had the stuff, and an
        appearence on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' proved he
        could still wow an audience. </p>
        <p>Dawson's latest disc, ''Just Rockin' &amp; Rollin' ''
        was released earlier this year on Upstart Records. </p>
        <p>He says music fans are again ready for his style of
        music. </p>
        <p>''I look into the audience at my shows now, and I see
        a wide, diverse age group -- teenagers to people in their
        40s and 50s,'' says Dawson. ''That tells me the music's
        timeless.''<font size="2"><strong> </strong></font></p>

        <p><br>
        <font size="5">W</font>hile popular culture might
        indicate otherwise, the world of music is wonderfully
        diverse. Since 1992, a small Long Island, N.Y., record
        company named Ellipsis Arts has been determined to bring
        that diverse world to your stereo. </p>
        <p>Ellipsis Arts releases this year include book-and-CD
        sets covering the music of: Tibetan monasteries; Tuva
        (between Siberia and Mongolia); the Pygmies of Central
        Africa; West Africa; and nature. There's also a set
        featuring experimental instruments. </p>
        <p>The experimental instruments collection, ''Gravikords,
        Whirlies &amp; Pyrophones,'' is the most amazing of the
        sets. </p>
        <p>The instruments featured range from the electronic
        theremin (the eerie-sounding instrument featured in
        science-fiction films and on the song ''Good
        Vibrations'') to the daxophone (a strip of wood played
        with a bow), to crystallophones and seraphins (glass
        instruments), to a bamboo saxophone (made from bamboo,
        cardboard and tin). </p>
        <p>Many of the instruments are as fascinating to look at
        as they are to hear, evidenced by the accompanying book
        written by Bart Hopkins, editor of Experimental Music
        Magazine. The book is filled with histories and glossy
        pictures of the instruments and their makers. </p>
        <p>Much of the collection is extremely listenable. </p>
        <p>The late Sugar Belly, inventor and player of the
        bamboo saxophone, was a star of Jamaican mento music
        (similar to calypso). His song ''Shake Up Adina,''
        included here, is a delight. </p>
        <p>Clara Rockmore was known as the master of the
        theremin, and with good reason. On ''The Swan,'' included
        on this disc, Rockmore plays the instrument so expertly
        that it makes sounds like a human voice. </p>
        <p>Phil Dadson's ''Pacific 3-2-1-Zero'' at first sounds
        like the surf music classic ''Miserlou.'' However, the
        primary sound is produced with long plastic tubes beaten
        with rubber bats and accompanied by various other
        percussive instruments. </p>
        <p>Many instruments included on the set produce tones
        more associated with Asian or Mid-Eastern instruments.
        The delicate-sounding gravikord (played and invented by
        Robert Grawi) has roots in an African instrument called
        the kora. Grawi's song ''Picadilly'' sounds like the
        addictive pop music of Madagascan group Tarika Sammy. </p>
        <p>A few instruments are less ear-friendly, but
        ''Gravikords, Whirlies and Pyrophones,'' both the book
        and CD, is engrossing and enlightening. The only
        frustration is that the book details 37 instruments and
        inventors, while the CD only includes examples of 18 of
        the artists and their creations. </p>
        <p>As otherworldly as many of the experimental
        instruments sound, the human voice can produce equally
        unusual sounds. </p>
        <p>The singers on ''Deep in the Heart of Tuva: Cowboy
        Music from the Wild East'' practice ''throat singing,'' a
        talent that allows artists to sing in more than one
        octave at once. </p>
        <p>The effect, which often produces a hypnotic buzzing
        sound similar to the Australian didgeridoo, is weird and
        entrancing. The set ends with two examples of San
        Franciscan Paul Pena adapting the style to American
        blues. The accompanying booklet is filled with Tuvan
        history, recipes and song lyrics. </p>
        <p>More examples of throat singing can be found on
        ''Tibet: The Heart of Dharma,'' which features Buddhist
        monks from the Loseling Dratsang of Drepung Monastery and
        the Khampagar Monastery (both of which have relocated
        from Tibet to India). </p>
        <p>While the Tuvan set features individual artists, the
        Tibetan collection features groups of singers in
        meditative sets, and the accompanying book offers a
        concise history of Buddhism. </p>
        <p>For a trip further south, there's ''Jali Kunda: Griots
        of West Africa &amp; Beyond.'' </p>
        <p>In West African culture, a griot (or jali) is a master
        musician, teacher and storyteller. This set features
        evocative selections by masters from Senegal, Guinea and
        Gambia. The selections include purely folk works as well
        as collaborations with modern classical composer Phillip
        Glass, jazz saxophonist Pharoah Sanders and funk band
        Mandingo. </p>
        <p>The sounds range from soothing to incredibly lively. </p>
        <p>For a journey into the bush, there's ''Bayaka: The
        Extraordinary Music of the Babenzele Pygmies.'' </p>
        <p>The Pygmies are captured amid the natural sounds of
        the jungle. At times, they are barely audible behind the
        chirping wildlife. Listening to their music truly seems
        like eavesdropping on a mysterious conversation between
        mankind and nature. </p>
        <p>''Notes From the Wild: The Nature Recordings of Bernie
        Krause'' dismisses man altogether. Crickets, whales,
        wolves, eagles, water, assorted birds and even ants are
        the performers here. Their stages are the Amazon jungle;
        the New Mexico desert; Glacier Bay, Alaska; the Rwandan
        mountains; and a meadow in High Sierras, Calif. </p>
        <p>While there's nothing here to hum along with, the
        collection is a simple appreciation that the world has
        always made music, even before man began to notice and
        manipulate its rhythms. </p>

<H3>NEW RELEASES: GEORGE MICHAEL, THE CURE, THE RAINCOATS</H3>



<B>TUNED IN</B><P>

<I>By CHUCK CAMPBELL, Music critic</I><P>


     The rating is done on a basis of one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five being the highest:<P>

     -- OLDER, George Michael (DreamWorks)<P>

    Judging from ``Older,'' George Michael's protracted contract dispute with Sony has sapped his creativity.<P>

    The album -- an inauspicious first release from DreamWorks Records (DreamWorks, as in Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen) -- is a grim journey through listless songs.<P>

    Yes, at 32 Michael is older (duh), but that doesn't have any positive ramifications here. He doesn't impart great wisdom, and his maturity merely translates to somber reservation.<P>

    Falling well short of his 1987 pinnacle ``Faith'' as well as its follow-up, ``Listen Without Prejudice: Vol. 1,'' Michael emerges from several years of seclusion with an understandably bitter release.<P>

    At least the second single ``Fastlove'' is good news; the slick R&B track is cruising up the charts with the same lusty infection that boosted the 1987 hit ``I Want Your Sex.''<P>

    But the new song is a misleading representative for ``Older.''<P>

    More typical is the lukewarmly received first single ``Jesus to a Child'' -- an epic yawner ballad. Although lushly crafted and smartly produced, ``Jesus to a Child'' and its kindred tracks ``Older,'' the aptly titled ``It Doesn't Really Matter'' and ``You Have Been Loved'' echo with artifice. And the warming tropical rhythms of ``The Strangest Thing'' and ``To Be Forgiven'' barely waft through Michael's cold synthetic cooing.<P>

    The singer does manage to deliver some interesting lines: On the modestly tempoed ``Spinning the Wheel,'' he deals with well-founded insecurities about a philandering lover, and the mild R&B ``Star People'' is an obvious reaction to his lengthy battle with Sony.<P>

    Then there's his beseeching come-on on ``The Strangest Thing'' that goes, ``I am frightened for my soul/Please, please make love to me.''<P>

    Now that's a line to remember next time you're in a bar.<P>

    Rating (five possible): XX 1/2<P>

    -- WILD MOOD SWINGS, The Cure (Elektra/Fiction)<P>

    Back when alternative rock really was alternative, The Cure was a pioneer.<P>

    Together with Siouxsie & The Banshees, The Cure set the prototype for a subset of progressive music in the late '70s with a melodically moving antithesis to the fitful adrenaline of punk.<P>

    And after all these years of bad makeup, whacked hair and gothic fans, The Cure is still making great music -- as is Siouxsie & The Banshees, in case you missed last year's ``The Rapture.''<P>

    The faces keep changing as band members rotate in and out (and sometimes back in), but The Cure's vocalist Robert Smith has always been there, singing away in a bizarre series of yodeling notes, gasps and yelps.<P>

    Guitarist Porl Thompson is the most noticeable depature on ``Wild Mood Swings,'' the group's first studio album since 1992. Smith and guitarist/bassist Perry Bamonte take up his slack. Also, Jason Cooper sits in as the new Cure drummer, replacing Boris Williams; Simon Gallup returns at bass; and keyboardist Roger O'Donnell rejoins the band.<P>

    It's still a distinctively Cure album, and it couldn't have a more appropriate title.<P>

    From the self-destructive longings on the brooding lead-off track, ``Want,'' to the over-the-top ecstasy of ``Mint Car'' (``I'm so fizzy I could burst!''), Smith shows all the signs of a personality disorder.<P>

    But what an entertaining manic-depressive he makes.<P>

    Against the mariachi exotica of ``The 13th,'' the first single, he wonders ``Am I seducing or being seduced?'' and swinging through ``Gone!'' he enthuses, ``You have to get up, get out and get living'' (advice some Cure fans could have used ages ago).<P>

    Yet Smith takes a snide look at love on the ornate ``This Is a Lie'' (one of six songs backed by a string quartet) and ``Trap,'' and the album closes with the fatalistic ``Bare.''<P>

    ``Jupiter Crash'' is of a more bittersweet nature (``Pulling away, she stands up slow/And round her the night turns''), and Smith makes the transition from an object of obsession to an object of rejection on ``Strange Attraction.'' Then there's the playful ``Club America,'' where Smith skewers nightclub conversations: ``So we talk for a while about some band you saw on TV/But I don't listen to you, and you don't listen to me.''<P>

    Those who appreciate the group at its most downcast will adore the album's heartbreaking highlight, ``Treasure,'' an elegant and eloquent farewell.<P>

    Typical of The Cure, ``Wild Mood Swings'' lingers too long on instrumental passages, which drags the momentum. But as long as Smith eventually takes the mike, there's a payoff.<P>

    Rating: XXXX<P>

    -- LOOKING IN THE SHADOWS, The Raincoats (DGC)<P>

    The Raincoats may have been an influence on some of progressive rock's biggest icons -- including Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon, Hole's Courtney Love and Nirvana's late Kurt Cobain -- but it will be a tough sell to make the group's reunion effort, ``Looking in the Shadows,'' popular among contemporary modern-rock fans.<P>

    Ana da Silva and Gina Birch are back from the original band (which lasted from 1977 to 1984), and both sing and play guitars and bass. They also divide the songwriting duties evenly, with each penning six tracks. (Newcomers are Heather Dunn on drums and Anne Wood on violin.)<P>

    The Raincoats still sound like an early '80s band, which isn't a bad thing, it's just not a very lucrative way for a new band to sound.<P>

    Using some Moog synthesizer for support and lots of fuzzy reverb and the occasional feedback, The Raincoats bounce through quirky, plucky rhythms with eccentric vocals and twisted themes.<P>

    Other than the edgy and fun ``Only Tonight'' and the breathy phantasm ``So Damn Early,'' da Silva's songs aren't very memorable.<P>

    Birch is more intriguing.<P>

    Singing like Eartha Kitt as a child, she whips through a psychotic ``Don't Be Mean'' (addressed to an ex-lover who won't even look at her) and dwells on the fascination pretty women hold on ``Pretty.''<P>

    She also sings about a woman obsessed with having a baby who gets a dog as a substitute (``Babydog''), dreams of suicide on the spooky ditty ``57 Ways To End It All'' and makes hoarse accusations at a bottle of gin on ``You Kill Me'' -- ``What is it you do that makes me not see through you?''<P>

    Thanks mostly to Birch, ``Looking in the Shadows'' is a fun album. But thanks to the tepid feel of the music and da Silva's lackluster songs, it's also an insubstantial one.<P>

<H2>DISNEY'S 'HUNCHBACK' IS NOTHING UNUSUAL</H2>

<I>NEW RELEASES: `HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME,' TINA ARENA, IMPERIAL DRAG<P></I>

<B>TUNED IN</B><P>

<I>By CHUCK CAMPBELL, Music Critic</I><P>

   The rating is done on a basis of one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five being the highest:<P>

   -- ``THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME'' SOUNDTRACK, various acts (Walt Disney)<P>

   Disney gears up for its obligatory animated summer blockbuster with an obligatory soundtrack.<P>

   ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' soundtrack (released in advance of the film's June 21 opening) reunites the ``Pocahontas'' team of composer Alan Menken (who also worked on ``The Little Mermaid,'' ``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``Aladdin'') and lyricist Stephen Schwartz.<P>

   Schwartz turned ``Pocahontas'' into a sickening PC free-for-all, and although he had the chance to do it all again with the Gypsy heroine Esmeralda, the songwriter is more or less restrained. And with lines about spilling innocent blood and guzzling beer, his lyrics aren't squeaky-clean/bland.<P>

   Meanwhile, Menken has the spotlight to himself on half a dozen instrumentals.<P>

   The composer also effectively creates a gothic tone for the orchestrated album -- particularly with judicious use of a 100-voice choir, creating a spooky environment on ``The Bells of Notre Dame,'' ``Heaven's Light/Hellfire'' and ``Humiliation.'' Plus he infuses ``Topsy Turvy'' with a carnival atmosphere and manufactures a ginger tone with delicate strings on ``The Bell Tower.''<P>

   But Menken dishes out a cornucopia of redundant bluster on the back-to-back-to-back instrumentals ``Sanctuary!'' ``And He Shall Smite the Wicked'' and ``Into the Sunlight.''<P>

   A number of stars who are the talking voices of the movie's characters aren't singing here, including Demi Moore and Kevin Kline. However, Tom Hulce, the voice of Quasimodo, DOES sing on a few tracks, and ``Seinfeld's'' Jason Alexander sings on the romping ``A Guy Like You.''<P>

  Most of the singing is left to theatrical types, whose over-careful, crystal-clear voices are obnoxious -- particularly Heidi Mollenhauer's: She billows through the Esmeralda song ``God Help the Outcasts,'' a nauseuous piece of dreck.<P>

  Naturally Disney wants a couple of hits out of this, so they had Bette Midler do a more palatable version of ``God Help the Outcasts'' as an alternative track (a la the Vanessa Williams cover of a ``Pocahontas'' song last year). And for a little insurance, All-4-One chips in a sappy ``Someday.''<P>

  This is typical Disney.<P>

  Rating (five possible): XX 1/2<P>

  -- DON'T ASK, Tina Arena (Epic)<P>

  Pop female soloists have become the ruling force on the charts thanks to the likes of Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Alanis Morissette, et al. And Australian Tina Arena is trying to nudge her way into the group with a Celine Dion-sounding hit single, ``Chains.''<P>

     The 26-year-old Melbourne native now based in Los Angeles has an Olivia Newton-John lilt in her voice and a simplistic, Amy Grant-styled lyrical perspective.<P>

     Yet despite her similarities to established pop queens, Arena's ``Don't Ask'' is hardly a guaranteed success in the States: The album stays on an even keel with a string of mildly amusing songs, but it lacks diversity, and there are few tracks that are above standard.<P>

     Arena, a former teen TV star Down Under, is already a smash in her homeland, and her popularity extends to South Africa and Europe. So her career isn't riding on American acceptance.<P>

     Besides, the gloss 'n' soul ``Chains'' already has served as a modest breakthrough here.<P>

     There's little on ``Don't Ask'' to substantiate prolonged enthusiasm, however. Other than ``Message,'' where Arena settles into a swell floating-synth vibe, and a showboating cover of Maria McKee's ``Show Me Heaven,'' Arena trudges through routine stuff.<P>

     The album is rounded out by several nondescript mid-tempo songs (``Heaven Help My Heart,'' ``Sorrento Moon,'' ``That's the Way a Woman Feels'' and ``Be a Man''), and some exceptionally boring tracks (``Wasn't It Good,'' ``Greatest Gift'').<P>

     Meanwhile, Arena's lyrics are vapid as she suggests love will solve all the world's problems (``Love Is the Answer'') and makes the silly testimonial ``I'm ready for love'' (``Standing Up'').<P>

     Such pedestrian material doesn't merit great reward.<P>

     Rating: XX<P>

     -- IMPERIAL DRAG, Imperial Drag (Work)<P>

     Imperial Drag's ``Boy or a Girl'' is one of the more inventive modern-rock songs of late.<P>

     On one hand, it's funny. Singer Eric Dover cautiously interrogates someone  he's drawn to: ``I feel straight, but I'm not so sure/Are you a boy or a girl?''<P>

     On the other hand, the song is ingeniously constructed, starting with a U2 ``With or Without You'' rhythm, sliding through snaky early Prince-ish verses and climaxing with an infectious chorus.<P>

     The California band has more such tricks on its self-titled debut album.<P>

     Launching the record with a wiry piece of funk/rock, ``Zodiac Sign'' (shades of the Red Hot Chili Peppers), Imperial Drag flaunts delicious all-around skills in both songwriting and execution.<P>

     The four-man group gets loopy with a slow-grinding ``The Man in the Moon,'' which wins with ethereal charm, and ``Dandelion'' is an excellent keyed-down track.<P>

     The diverse album heads the other way with the chugging rock anthem ``Stare Into the Sun'' and the solid ``Spyder,'' a drug pusher's theme song (well, a dumb drug pusher's theme song).<P>

     Imperial Drag's inspiration is inconsistent, however, and a few surprisingly flat tracks take a disappointing toll -- particularly the dreadful ballad ``Illuminate.''<P>

     But on ``Scaredy Cats and Egomaniacs,'' Dover proclaims, ``Flash in the pan, you know, was never quite our style/We're too belligerent, determined, young and wild.''<P>

    So expect them to endure.<P>

    Rating: XXX 1/2<P>

<I>By CHUCK CAMPBELL, Music critic</I><P>



     The rating is done on a basis of one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five being the highest:<P>

     -- SPIRITCHASER, Dead Can Dance (4AD)<P>

     In sports they call it The Zone -- an unexplainable state of mind in which a player does everything right, seemingly without thinking.<P>

     Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry are playing beyond The Zone and have been for about a decade as the duo Dead Can Dance.<P>

     With each release, Dead Can Dance pulls further away from other world-music practitioners who attempt to marry one genre to another. Gerrard and Perry, native Australians (though he lives in Ireland now), have blended genres so expertly that the sources have blurred and distinctions are irrelevant.<P>

     The two fold South American influences into the mix on ``Spiritchaser,'' most obviously on ``Song of the Dispossessed,'' fleshing out the overall character of the album. Ditto numerous other nuances from around the globe, but the songs couldn't be accurately labeled ``Haitian'' or ``Egyptian'' or even ``Caribbean'' or ``African.'' They are all simply Dead Can Dance songs.<P>

     Less Gaelic than the duo's 1993 masterpiece ``Into the Labyrinth'' and less surreal than Gerrard's superb 1995 solo album ``The Mirror Pool,'' ``Spiritchaser'' is rooted in organic rhythms.<P>

     Perry and Gerrard play much of the music, but the two best instruments they have are their voices: His resonates with rich vitality while hers soars on a spiritual tremolo.<P>

     The harmonies of the two former lovers can be magical, as on ``Indus,'' a sultry track where she hovers over the sensual rhythm until he gently guides her down to him. When their enticing voices finally merge, they drip with eroticism. <P>

     Meanwhile, her voice is the seducer amid the layers of world-music exotica on ``The Snake and the Moon,'' reining in his virile chants with an arousing lower-register vocal.<P>

     Gerrard and Perry take a languid journey together on ``Song of the Nile,'' and they create alluring atmosphere on ``Nierika'' and ``Song of the Stars'' using extensive percussion, bewitching instrumentation and sampled animal noises.<P>

     The evocative denouement is symbolic as Gerrard meditates on the starkly ethereal ``Devorzhum.''<P>

     Leave it to Dead Can Dance to put a metaphysical spin on something so  carnal.<P>

     Rating (five possible): XXXXX<P>

     -- LOAD, Metallica (Elektra)<P>

     Metallica, the group that emerged as the pre-eminent heavy metal band in the '80s and has since become the genre's sole successful survivor, is an ironic headliner for this year's Lollapalooza.<P>

     The 15-year-old band has seen the metal fanbase eroded by modern rock, and Lollapalooza is essentially a showcase of modern-rock acts.<P>

     But Metallica didn't go down with heavy metal's demise, and the foursome hasn't changed it's sound much, either. So if anything, Metallica's role in Lollapalooza could be a tribute to longevity and recognition of a hard-working  band that tours exhaustively. <P>

     Metallica isn't very prolific in producing albums, however: The new ``Load'' is only its sixth release, and it might be a test of fan loyalty, which so far has been unwavering.<P>

     At least it throws no curve balls.<P>

     With only passing nods to progressive rock (such as the diverting melodies on ``Until It Sleeps'' and ``Hero of the Day''), ``Load'' is reanimated Metallica metal featuring bruising guitars by Kirk Hammett and crushing bass by Jason Newsted.<P>

     Although the formula is dated, the classic chugging sound still packs a wallop. Add some nasty grooves (``2 X 4,'' ``Ronnie''), occasional springy funk and thoughtful ballads, and ``Load'' is more than serviceable.<P>

     Also, to counteract the typical gloom and doom that dominates, vocalist James Hetfield discovers humor with self-parody on ``Poor Twisted Me'' and ``Wasting My Hate,'' a song that treats hate as a precious commodity.<P>

     Yet Metallica is mired in songs that go nowhere (``Curve,'' ``Thorn Within''); slower songs tend to be mopey (such as the epic otherworld yawn . . . er, yarn . . . ``The House That Jack Built''); and several tracks plod through status quo. The worst is the closing song, ``The Outlaw Torn,'' which after nearly 10 minutes of meandering builds to a routine fade.<P>

     Metallica reportedly had such a surplus of material while penning ``Load'' that the group may release a new album in a year or so -- a remarkably short turnover time for this band.<P>

     Heavy metal is dead. Long live heavy metal. <P>

     Rating: XXX<P>

     -- COPPEROPOLIS, Grant Lee Buffalo (Slash/Reprise)<P>

     Grant Lee Buffalo falls below its potential on ``Copperopolis.''<P>

     The three-man Los Angeles band's third release is a good album, but the effort doesn't appear to match the presumed capabilities of lead vocalist/guitarist Grant Lee Phillips, bassist/producer Paul Kimble and drummer Joey Peters.<P>

     Phillips is a gifted songwriter, articulately tapping into the American subconscious with neither cliches nor pretense. And his empathetic voice, distinct and wide-ranging, dovetails wonderfully with the band's quasi-folk arrangements.<P>

     In other words, Grant Lee Buffalo is what Hootie & The Blowfish should aspire to be.<P>

     Nevertheless, ``Copperopolis'' simply doesn't abound in clever hooks or memorable moments: It's a near-flatline of solid entertainment, infrequently dipping slightly into a dull range and sometimes arching into mini-peaks.<P>

     There's an apocalyptic rumble on ``Armchair,'' a pastoral glow to ``Bethlehem Steel,'' a swaggering cadence to ``All That I Have'' . . . and Phillips glides along with the right emotional touch, be it the melancholia of ``Better for Us,'' the urgency of ``Crackdown'' or the fragility of ``Arousing Thunder.'' <P>

     He sings indictments of militias on ``Homespun'' (``suspicion is a powerful religion'') and intolerance in general on ``Crackdown.'' He gives a sidelong view of the exodus from Los Angeles to the Northwest on ``Hyperion and Sunset'' and conducts a postmortem of a boomtown's glory days on ``Bethlehem Steel,'' observing its hope and sense of destiny.<P>

     Phillips also writes about himself and his vulnerabilities. On the dark-tinged ``All That I Have,'' for example, he sings, ``I got a girl waiting for me/Just down the dock and over the sea/Until I lay my head in her lap/I'm all that I have.''<P>

     In spite of its commendable qualities, however, ``Copperopolis'' isn't all it should be.<P>

NEW RELEASES: BECK, PATTI SMITH, ``NUTTY PROFESSOR''<P>


<B>TUNED IN</B><P>

<I>By CHUCK CAMPBELL, Music Critic</I><P>

     The rating is done on a basis of one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five being the highest:<P>

     -- ODELAY, Beck (DGC)<P>

     Despite critical accolades espousing the genius of his 1994 debut album, ``Mellow Gold,'' Beck amounted to a mere novelty act with the song ``Loser'' . . . and a Lollapalooza joke.<P>

     Critics are fawning over Beck's new ``Odelay,'' too, but don't expect it to set any sales records.<P>

     Beck is a Los Angeles native with blues roots who found his way into New York's ``anti-folk'' scene in the late '80s. His dexterity and his exhaustive awareness of music led to the eclectic ``Mellow Gold,'' a source of fascination to hybridists with far-flung interests.<P>

     Yet the self-consciously clever latter-day Beastie Boy wasn't universally beloved for ``Mellow Gold,'' and he won't be for ``Odelay'': Listening to Beck's work involves too much tedious waiting around as he contrives to fit in the next element on his genre-busting journey.<P>

     Like any other geek flaunting specialized knowledge, Beck is a bore.<P>

     Still, the carefully constructed chaos of ``Odelay'' can be intriguing. On the track ``Lord Only Knows,'' Beck slides a deliberately anachronistic fuzzbox into the pedal steel-enhanced Southern folk/rock brew, and the raw blues foundation of ``Hotwax'' supports harmonica riffs, hip-hop scratching and Beck rapping through a voice modulator.<P>

     Meanwhile, he chants ``I got two turntables and a microphone'' on the first single ``Where It's At,'' a playful retro-funk number that might follow ``Loser's'' lead. (In case we weren't paying attention, Beck declares ``That was a good drum break'' after a messy shuffling interlude.)<P>

     He doesn't infuse anything meaningful into his lyrics, which are often twisted cultural references delivered in a stream of consciousness, and that's consistent with the meaningless instrumental melange.<P>

     Other stopping points on the spectrum include the industrial-hop of ``Novacane,'' a pale imitation of Sonic Youth discord on ``Minus'' and a semi-genuine honky-tonk track, ``Sissyneck.''<P>

     Along the way are numerous kitschy studio gimmicks and so many nods to various styles, a chiropractor might be in order.<P>

     Funny how something so desperately unique can sound so dull.<P>

     Rating (five possible): XX<P>

     -- GONE AGAIN, Patti Smith (Arista)<P>

     Patti Smith explores the art of letting go on ``Gone Again.''<P>

     The punk god of the '70s left the insular trappings of rock in 1980, joining the real world of suburban Detroit with her husband, Fred ``Sonic'' Smith (former guitarist for MC5). The couple produced two children and just one album (1988's ``Dream of Life'').<P>

     But Patti Smith has taken some hard blows -- namely the 1989 death of her ally, photographer Robert Mapplethorpe (to AIDS), then the 1994 death of her husband (to heart failure), followed a month later by the death of her brother, Todd (to a heart attack).<P>

     Shelving punk idiosyncrasies, Patti Smith delivers an appreciably human project in ``Gone Again,'' a cathartic album about accepting mortality.<P>

     Usually touching and sometimes even moving, ``Gone Again'' includes only a few substandard tracks -- the obscure post-industrial meditation on the late Kurt Cobain, ``About a Boy,'' the dull ``My Madrigal'' and an uninteresting, blunt cover of Bob Dylan's ``Wicked Messenger.''<P>

     The album features two collaborations with her late husband (the gritty title track and the doom-obsessed ``Summer Cannibals''), but Patti Smith, a poet with vast integrity, works best on her own.<P>

     With engaging simplicity on ``Wings,'' she longs for her lost love but releases him, and accompanied by the lilt of an accordion on ``Ravens,'' she takes a clear-minded view of her own eventual demise.<P>

     On the humorous-yet-sweet country ditty ``Dead to the World,'' Smith has a vision of the deceased: ``I was feeling sensations in no dictionary/He was less than a breath of shimmer and smoke/The life in his fingers unwound my existence/Dead to the world, alive I awoke.''<P>

     But no song is more powerful than her beautiful album-closer, ``Farewell Reel,'' which she pointedly introduces as, ``This little song is for Fred.'' On the track she bereaves her loss but ends optimistically, equating a rainbow in the sky with her late husband's smile.<P>

     As hokey as the notion may seem, Smith handles the line with heartbreaking grace.<P>

     Rating: XXXX<P>

     -- ``THE NUTTY PROFESSOR'' soundtrack, various acts (Def Jam)<P>

     The performers on ``The Nutty Professor'' soundtrack represent the state of urban music: singers and rappers of questionable talent with little imagination.<P>

     Most of the singers apparently believe that singing scales is all there is to being a good vocalist, and only a couple of the rappers can be distinguished from the others.<P>

     The bulk of the tracks are collaborations between singers and rappers, leading to cumbersome credits such as ``My Crew Can't Go for That'' by Trigger Tha Gambler featuring Smoothe Da Hustler and D.V. Alias Khrist -- a track that reinterprets the Daryl Hall & John Oates hit ``I Can't Go for That.'' (By the way,  Oates is misspelled as ``Oats'' both times he's mentioned in the liner notes. Talk about cold.)<P>

     Although the lyrics are stale and marked by juvenile innuendo, some of the acts at least try to come up with clever names for themselves -- such as Az Yet, a lame ensemble of Boyz II Men wannabes, and Dos of Soul, a sorry act who overdose in double entendre. (Incidentally, explicit lyrics are deleted, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out how to fill in those vocal gaps.)<P>

     Anyway, rappers Slick Rick (who turns a typically comical performance, appearing with singer Montell Jordan on ``I Like'') and LL Cool J (who chips in the sleek ``Doin' It Again'') elevate the soundtrack. And a female rapper named Foxy Brown teams up with Case on the hit single ``Touch Me Tease Me,'' a workable blend of R&B and rap.<P>

     Plus the low-key instrumentation underscoring the soundtrack is cohesive -- a  mellow sound compatible with summer.<P>

     But boy is it ever forgettable.<P>

ALBUM</h2>
<h3>NEW RELEASES: SCREAMING TREES, 
MACARENA, ``PLACE OF HOPE''</h3>
<p><strong>TUNED IN</strong></p>
<p><em>By CHUCK CAMPBELL, Music Critic</em></p>
<p>The rating is done on a basis of one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five 
being the highest:</p>
<p>-- DUST, Screaming Trees (Epic)</p>
<p>Lollapalooza's Screaming Trees have an unusual explanation for the 4-year 
hiatus between 1992's ``Sweet Oblivion'' and its new ``Dust.''</p>
<p>It seems the Ellensburg, Wash., band recorded a ``Sweet Oblivion'' 
follow-up in 1994, then decided it wasn't worth releasing and trashed it. The 
sole track to survive the debacle and make it onto ``Dust'' is ``Dying Days'' 
-- and that only after a considerable overhaul.</p>
<p>We may never know how bad the '94 would-be album was, but ``Dust'' is 
satisfying.</p>
<p>Drummer Barrett Martin supports the usual guitar (Gary Lee Conner) and 
bass (Van Conner) with an array of instruments, including congas, tablas, 
harmonium and cello. Meanwhile Benmont Tench, who isn't officially a 
Screaming Tree, is featured on 8 of the 10 tracks, playing mellotron and 
keyboards.</p>
<p>The band is still a traditional rock outfit. It just has a little more flavoring than 
usual, which leads to inviting washes of Mideastern music and Gothic 
soundscapes, among other things.</p>
<p>In addition, Mark Lanegan is far more intriguing that the average rock 
vocalist, dovetailing his smooth voice into the stormy mix with the instincts of 
a (restrained) crooner. His calming, melodic vocal steadies the chaos of ``All 
I Know'' and ``Halo of Ashes'' and puts a mellow spin on the evocative 
``Look at You.''</p>
<p>Although the Screaming Trees are limited by redundancy, the group 
conducts successful experiments with a wistful dreamscape on ``Sworn and 
Broken,'' enticing surrealism on ``Traveler'' and a binge of psychedelia on 
the epic ``Gospel Plow.''</p>
<p>Even when the songs are more conventionally modern rock, they're 
contagious: The careening buzz of ``Witness'' may be repetitive, for example, 
but the group's fundamentals are enticing.</p>
<p>The Screaming Trees are in a good groove. Maybe the next album won't 
take so long.</p>
<p>Rating (five possible): XXXX</p>
<p>-- ``MACARENA CLUB CUTZ,'' various acts (RCA)</p>
<p>``Macarena,'' the latest summer novelty hit, has its own dance, and an 
illustrated, 10-step instruction on how to do the dance is included on 
``Macarena Club Cutz.''</p>
<p>The compilation disc also includes the Bayside Boys remix of the Los Del 
Rio dancehall song -- the only English language version of the song (which 
features a modern-day Latina kind of Valley Girl), and the same one that's 
getting so much airplay.</p>
<p>But ``Macarena Club Cutz'' doesn't include any other songs by Los Del Rio, 
and only one track -- Layla's ``Gotta Find Love'' -- even has a similar 
dancehall sound.</p>
<p>All the same, there are a few other points of interest among the remaining 10 
tracks. There's a quick radio mix of Scatman John's 1995 hit ``Scatman 
(Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)'' and a pounding remix of Rapination's ``Love 
Me the Right Way'' (which doesn't seem to have a precise beginning or end, 
just one long midway passage).</p>
<p>Dreamworld's ``Movin' Up'' uses spastic beats to make up for what it lacks 
in creativity, and the desperate energy of Matrix's ``Can You Feel It'' rides a 
heady Hi-NRG groove.</p>
<p>The remaining six tracks are mundane and overlong dance songs. Chill's 
neo-disco remake of the KISS classic ``I Was Made for Loving You'' might 
generate a momentary pause, but it's as tediously mindless as the others.</p>
<p>It's hard to say if those seduced by ``Macarena'' will be so drawn to the 
more straightforward material that rounds out ``Macarena Club Cutz,'' but 
chances are they won't.</p>
<p>Rating: XX 1/2</p>
<p>-- ``PLACE OF HOPE,'' various acts (Warner Bros.)</p>
<p>The U.S.A. meets the new S.A. on ``Place of Hope,'' a collaboration of 
American and South African performers that stamps a smiley face on a 
nation still very much in turmoil.</p>
<p>The album is ostensibly a cheerleading soundtrack to celebrate a united 
South Africa. But anyone who's been there in the last several months 
(including yours truly) will say South Africa is still extraordinarily divided - 
not just because of the blatant, unapologetic racism of the white Afrikaners 
and the English-descended white South Africans, but also because of the 
bloody strife amongst the country's black tribes vying for power.</p>
<p>Ironically, ``Place of Hope'' emphasizes the Zulu tribe when the lyrics aren't 
in English, and it's a faction of Zulus giving President Nelson Mandela the 
most trouble right now, demanding (through force) that a section of the 
country's Natal region be broken off into a separate Zulu nation.</p>
<p>But enough of that: Let's all hold hands and sing along to mamby-pamby 
music.</p>
<p>Symptomatic of popular South African radio, ``Place of Hope'' offers 
remade and watered-down western hits - an elevator jazz version of ``That's 
the Way of the World,'' a cover of Sting's ``Fragile'' and a blanded-out 
version of the already bland ``Broken Wings'' (which includes an incredibly 
goofy reading of Maya Angelo's poem ``Still I Rise.'') </p>
<p>Fortunately, the South African vocal group Ladysmith Black Mambazo 
leads a memorable rendition of ``Amazing Grace,'' and American Bela Fleck 
plays banjo on a rousing instrumental he penned, ``New South Africa.''</p>
<p>There's also a spiritual cover of Bob Marley's ``One Love/People Get 
Ready,'' and ``Now or Never'' is at least festive cacophony.</p>
<p>South Africa is still a place of hope, of course, but it seems a bit early to 
celebrate.</p>
<p>Besides, ``Place of Hope'' isn't much of a party.</p>
<p>Rating: XX</p>

'WORLD'</h2>
<p><strong>TUNED IN</strong> </p>
<p><em>By CHUCK CAMPBELL, Music Critic</em> </p>
<p>The rating is done on a basis of one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five 
being the highest: </p>
<p>-- IT'S A MAN'S WORLD, Cher (Reprise) </p>
<p>Except for a couple of inappropriate guitar solos, Cher has given up on rock 
with ``It's a Man's World.'' </p>
<p>Dressed up with a little R&amp;B and even some hip-hop, the singer glides 
through the netherworld of adult contemporary music in a professional, if 
unspectacular, way. </p>
<p>Eighteen songwriters had a hand in penning the album's 11 tracks, but that 
doesn't lead to discord, thanks to the continuity of Cher's distinctive voice 
and the mundanity of the sterile production. </p>
<p>Cher herself splits a songwriting credit with Anthony Griffiths on the opening 
track and current single, ``One by One.'' She's certainly done worse than 
this song, a subtle (perhaps too subtle) slice of sleek R&amp;B. </p>
<p>The singer also performs an uninspiringly competent makeover of Don 
Henley's ``Not Enough Love in the World''; she does a torchy cover of 
James Brown on ``It's a Man's Man's Man's World''; and Cher actually 
injects some personality into Marc Cohn's insipid ``Walking in Memphis.'' </p>
<p>She goes for a little drama on ``I'm Blowin' Away,'' and she goes for a LOT 
of drama on her cover of the Walker Brothers' ``The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine 
Anymore.'' </p>
<p>Otherwise, she's surprisingly sedate . . . she even sounds like she might be 
trying to sell something subliminally underneath the springy, much-too-safe 
funk of ``Paradise Is Here.'' And although her lower-register singing is a nice 
discreet touch, she sounds like a watered-down Annie Lennox on ``Angels 
Running'' and ``The Gunman.'' </p>
<p>``It's a Man's World'' is inoffensively bland and moderately enjoyable -- in 
other words it's quintessential Cher. </p>
<p>Take it or leave it. </p>
<p>Rating (five possible): XX 1/2 </p>
<p>-- WAX ECSTATIC, Sponge (Columbia) </p>
<p>Sponge aims to soak up spill over from the success of its 1994 platinum 
debut ``Rotting Pinata'' with its follow-up, ``Wax Ecstatic.'' </p>
<p>Not quite worth getting ecstatic over, the album is still a concrete sophomore 
effort from the Detroit band that plastered the alternative charts with the 
single ``Plowed.'' </p>
<p>``Wax Ecstatic'' rockets out of the gate with the track ``My Purity,'' where 
drummer Charlie Grover's feverish beat whisks along Vinnie Dombroski's 
fatalistic vocals (``Drag me down and plow me under''). </p>
<p>Sponge is something of a Nine Inch Nails for the mainstream -- all rhythm 
and rock and anxiety, but not to Trent Reznor's extreme. </p>
<p>Dombroski's psychotic mumblings on ``Got To Be a Bore'' are countered by 
metallic riffs; he rumbles through paranoia on the unnerving ``Silence Is Their 
Drug''; and backed by a foreboding grind on ``I Am Anastasia,'' he's 
possessed by Anastasia Nikolayevna, the youngest daughter of Russian 
Emperor Nicholas II who has been thought by some to have survived the 
massacre of her family after the October Revolution of 1918. Of course if 
Dombroski is channeling her now, she must finally be dead . . . </p>
<p>But Sponge is a more ordinary cousin of NIN: On the title track, for 
example, the nervous energy of the rhythm and the teasing guitars eventually 
lead to a generic modern-rock chorus. And the cheap sentimentalism of 
``Have You Seen Mary'' and ``Velveteen'' is beneath Reznor. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, there's an odd fixation on ``Wax Ecstatic.'' ``The Drag Queens 
of Memphis'' is a bizarre slow blend of gospel-ish piano, steel guitar and 
blues. Later in the album comes ``The Death of a Drag Queen,'' a gothic 
number with no stylistic connection to ``The Drag Queens of Memphis,'' 
though it could be another scene in some modern-rock musical about 
transvestites. </p>
<p>If nothing else, Sponge would be easier to remember if it pursued that theme 
further. </p>
<p>Rating: XXX 1/2 </p>
<p>-- BACK TO THE WORLD, Tevin Campbell (Qwest/Warner Bros.) </p>
<p>Tevin Campbell may be best remembered as the kid discovered by Quincy 
Jones and used by Prince as lead vocalist on the hit single ``Round and 
Round.'' </p>
<p>But the Dallas-born singer kept plugging away with semi-successful solo 
albums, 1991's ``T.E.V.I.N.'' and 1993's ``I'm Ready'' (featuring the hit 
single ``Can We Talk''). </p>
<p>After a three-year break, during which he earned his high-school diploma, 
Campbell returns with the edge-of-mature ``Back to the World.'' </p>
<p>Overproduced by a score of studio wizards (including Babyface), ``Back to 
the World'' gives backing singers priority over Campbell. And the 
instrumentation is little more than rote R&amp;B. </p>
<p>At least the title track works -- a rich mix of melodic supporting vocals, 
memorable chorus and Campbell's nasal, brink-of-adulthood twang. </p>
<p>He also does well on the plucky ``I Need You,'' which loses momentum 
only when the obligatory backing vocals coo their way in. And serviceable, 
but antiseptic, arrangements shimmer on the soft ``I'll Be There'' and the 
Prince-ly adoration song, ``Beautiful Thing.'' </p>
<p>Yet too often Campbell is left carrying on like a soloing member of Boyz II 
Men, and the real singing is up to those tireless backing vocalists. </p>
<p>Plus the songs simply lack imagination. Considering the endless lyrical and 
musical cliches, it's hard to believe that some of these tracks have five or six 
songwriters. </p>
<p>With ``Back to the World,'' Tevin Campbell is maturing from a kid sensation 
to an anonymous adult. </p>
<p>Rating: XX </p>

<HEAD><TITLE>NEW RELEASES: ME'SHELL NDEGEOCELLO, BRIAN GREEN, ``COMMON GROUND''</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><H2>NEW RELEASES: ME'SHELL NDEGEOCELLO, BRIAN GREEN, ``COMMON GROUND''</H2>

<i>By Chuck Campbell, Music Critic</i><P>

     The rating is done on a basis of one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five being the highest:<P>

     -- PEACE BEYOND PASSION, Me'Shell Ndegeocello (Maverick/Reprise)<P>

     Regardless of its inaccessibility, Me'Shell Ndegeocello's ``Peace Beyond Passion'' is a compelling album.<P>

     A blunt rebuttal to some long-standing Christian traditions as well as a frank embrace of sensuality, the vocalist/bass player's sophomore release is built on layers of textured grooves and provocative lyrics.<P>

     As if her subject matter isn't enough to ostracize her, Ndegeocello's unconventional sound prevents her from falling neatly into any clearly defined format, and therefore makes it difficult for her to land on any but the more adventurous radio outlets.<P>

     Moving to New York after growing up in Washington, D.C., Ndegeocello picked up numerous critical accolades for her 1993 debut ``Plantation Lullabies.'' She subsequently came to greater recognition in her collaboration with John Mellencamp on the hit single ``Wild Night.''<P>

     Now Ndegeocello presents ``Peace Beyond Passion,'' an album with two distinct perspectives: She is a worldly sage, questioning the manipulative use of religion and racism. Yet she's also a sexual being driven by lust.<P>

     Appropriately beginning with ``The Womb,'' a brief instrumental, the first half of the album addresses Ndegeocello's conflicted view of theology -- ashamed of ``prayin' to my pretty white Jesus'' (on ``The Way''),  pondering the biblical implications of systematic discrimination (``Deuteronomy . . .'') and contemplating the hypocrisy of Christian contempt for homosexuality (``Leviticus . . .'').<P>

     Her musings are alternately spoken and sung, and she emerges from her bitter cynicism with the serenity of ``God Shiva,'' on which she dedicates herself to a god she can accept on her own terms. <P>

     The second half of the album is committed to more intimate matters, starting with her textured interpretation of Bill Withers' ``Who Is He and What Is He to You,'' which rings true with her convincing delivery of such lines as ``Before you wreck your old home, be certain of the new.''<P>

     ``Peace Beyond Passion'' also includes a few virtually interchangeable tracks about obsessive longing -- ``Stay,'' ``Bittersweet'' and ``A Tear and a Smile.''<P>

     Not only are those songs redundant, but the music on the album is repetitive. After crafting an absorbing composite of cool jazz and smart R&B, it's too bad Ndegeocello couldn't put extra zip into individual tracks.<P>

     On the other hand, the slight monotony lends cohesion to the mood of the album, and its rich atmosphere goes uninterrupted.<P>

     Rating (five possible): XXXX<P>

     -- ONE STOP CARNIVAL, Brian Green (Yab Yum/550 Music)<P>

     Although he's played David on ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' for years, Brian Green is an easy actor to forget. With ``One Stop Carnival,'' Green is now forgettable as a rapper, too.<P>

     Green has an unvarying rap delivery -- projecting through his nose, monotonously arcing up line after line, track after track. It's not simply that he's white; it's that he's grating and gawkish and impossible to take seriously.<P>

     And frankly, Green's getting a little long in tooth for bubblegum rap -- he isn't exactly a new kid on the block. (Plus his liberal sprinkling of expletives doesn't make ``One Stop Carnival'' any more mature.)<P>

     Even Marky Mark had more legitimacy than this . . . and Green isn't likely to be getting any calls from Calvin Klein.<P>

     Nevertheless, there's a whole demographic of teen and pre-teen girls out there waiting to be exploited by the next great white hope of rap. If Luke Perry and Jason Priestley won't cut an album, why not Green?<P>

     ``One Stop Carnival'' avoids absolute calamity with its instrumentation, a kind of muted exotica with hypnotic allure. But it's hard to overlook Green embarrassing himself with implausible storytelling (``1-2-Threez''), undignified braggadocio (``Didn't Have a Clue'') and an ironic quest for style (``Style Iz It'').<P>

     Strip out the vocals, and this album would be almost good enough to sleep to.<P>

     Rating: X 1/2<P>

     -- COMMON GROUND: VOICES OF MODERN IRISH MUSIC, various acts (EMI)<P>

     Prolific Irish producer Donal Lunny attempts to bridge traditional Irish music to a modern context with ``Common Ground: Voice of Modern Irish Music.''<P>

     Sometimes it's hard to discern what the concept is on the album, which pulls together a mostly Irish lineup to do straightforward and roundabout renditions of traditional and newer songs, usually in English but sometimes not.<P>

     Although there's typically at least a vague undercurrent of something Irish on the 13 tracks, occasionally too many liberties are taken. For example, U2's Bono and Adam Clayton chose to refashion the U2 song ``Tomorrow'' into an obscure variation, and the bleak fiddle that meanders about is the only noteworthy Irish element.<P>

     By contrast, Clannad's Maire Brennan and cult icon Kate Bush go as far as to sing their very Irish selections in Gaelic -- Brennan on the airy ``O Bhean A'Ti'' and Bush on the string-and-harp-decorated ``Mna Na h-Eireann.''<P>

     Other than a bland midsection (Paul Brady's nondescript ``Help Me To Believe,'' Sinead O'Connor's leaden ``On Raglan Road'' and Brian Kennedy's whiny ``As I Roved Out'') and a pair of duds toward the end by Andy Irvine and Christy Moore, ``Common Ground'' is a winsome listen.<P>

     Particularly entertaining are a pair of plucky instrumentals, ``Cavan Potholes'' (with Sharon Shannon on button accordion) and `Whistling Low/Errigal'' (with Davy Spillane on low whistle and uillean pipes). Also, Elvis Costello nails the 19th-century ballad ``The Night Before Larry Was Stretched'' with perfect pathos. And New Zealanders Tim and Neil Finn of Crowded House link Irish roots to swaggering American country on ``Mary of the South Seas.''<P>

     But returning to that Irish/not Irish thing: A prevalent feature of ``Cathain'' by Liam O'Maonlai (of Hothouse Flowers) is the hum of a didgeridoo, an instrument of Australia's aborigines.<P>

     What could be farther from the Emerald Isle than the outback?<P>

     Rating: XXX 1/2<P>

By Chuck Campbell, News-Sentinel Music Critic</i><P>

     The rating is done on a basis of one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five being the highest:<P>

     -- STAR TURTLE, Harry Connick Jr. (Columbia)<P>

     Harry Connick Jr.'s ``Star Turtle'' is about an extra-terrestrial turtle who lands in New Orleans and waits for a star to be painted on his shell. The painter becomes the turtle's musical tour guide to the city, and afterward, the creature aims to return to his homeland.<P>

     Connick is nuts.<P>

     Or maybe he's just bored after all these years of making music . . . Although it seems his movie career would be diversion enough: After appearing in ``Memphis Belle,'' ``Little Man Tate'' and ``Copycat,'' Connick now can be seen in ``Independence Day,'' and he's slated to play a car salesman in the upcoming ``Excess Baggage.''<P>

     Plus his wife, Jill, just gave birth to his first child (Georgia Tatom) in April.<P>

     Whatever Connick was thinking on his quasi-concept album, it doesn't really work.<P>

     Still tripping on the sounds of his native New Orleans -- as he did on his fine 1994 release, ``She'' -- the infinitely talented singer/multi-instrument musician produces a technically astute collection of songs.<P>

     Yet despite the skill and Connick's charisma, something is amiss.<P>

     ``Star Turtle'' lacks oomph.<P>

     After an austere heavy metal-esque monologue by a demonic-sounding alien turtle (Connick), the tour begins with some swinging songs, including the album's loose and bouncy highlight, ``How Do Y'all Know.'' Then comes a simple ode to Connick's piano teacher (James Booker), ``Hear Me in the Harmony,'' followed by a horn-driven romp, ``Reason To Believe,'' and a melancholy ballad about longing, ``Just Like Me.''<P>

     Another segue takes the album to a funky ``Little Farley'' and a trio of cheesy rock songs, ``Eyes of the Seeker,'' ``Nobody Like You to Me'' and ``Boozehound.''<P>

     The last leg of the journey gets the traveling pair to the album's final three songs, a spirited ``Never Young'' (reminiscent of '70s-era Elton John), a drum-free-for-all featuring bassist Tony Hall on vocals, ``Mind on the Matter,'' and Connick's loving tribute to his hometown, ``City Beneath the Sea.''<P>

     After the musical potpourri, the turtle is so inspired by his experience, he's motivated to return home and save his race (from what?).<P>

     That turtle is undemanding: Connick's hooks are inconsistent, and the disjointed presentation just doesn't match ``She'' for overall entertainment.<P>

     But turtles are slow.<P>

     Rating (five possible): XX 1/2<P>

     -- LAND OF THE LIVING, Kristine W (RCA)<P>

     Drag queens looking for new material will find a bonanza in Kristine W's ``Land of the Living.''<P>

     The former Miss Washington (she won the talent and swimsuit competitions in the Miss America pageant, but not the crown) fashions herself into a modern diva on her debut. She's had good training, starring in her own dance-music revue at the Las Vegas Hilton for several years.<P>

     ``Land of the Living'' is about as much as a neo-disco album can hope to be: insistent beats, insinuating rhythms . . . and a woman at the helm who dramatically belts out the hooks.<P>

     Nightclubbers may already be familiar with Kristine W from her 1994 club hit ``Feel What You Want,'' an effectively mindless quasi-techno number. And the more recent single ``One More Try'' also has become a bar hit with its mood-setting intro and climactic rhythm ascension.<P>

     Yet there are better songs than these on the album -- ``Let Me In'' is a rambunctious dance-floor roll call, for example, and ``Don't Wanna Think'' is an ambitious track about disconnecting from the world.<P>

     But the highlight is the showy title track, a techno-tinged songs that blasts off from its stately opening with the singer's soulful, fired-up delivery of such lines as, ``I know the show is over, and the lights have gone down/There's no flowers at my door/No, no callers come around, baby/But I'm glad to be alive/And in the land of the living.''<P>

     Kristine W comes off a little flat on the more subtle numbers (the smoky ``Love Song,'' the slinky ``Sweet Mercy Me''), and ``Jazzin','' her sequel to Sheila E.'s ``Glamorous Life,'' doesn't measure up -- though her over-the-top singing of the word ``cocaine'' (``coh-oh-oh-oh-oh-caine!'') is a riot.<P>

     What's a diva without theatrics?<P>

     Rating: XXXX<P>

     -- TRIP 66, Trip 66 (Ruffhouse/Columbia)<P>

     ``Trip 66'' isn't a bad debut album from a group of teenagers recording in a basement studio.<P>

     Led by vocalist Maria Nicgorski, her guitarist/brother Paul Nicgorski and three of their neighborhood friends, the Pennsylvania teens who call themselves Trip 66 converted the Nicgorski home into a group hangout and eventually The Trip Basement Studio.<P>

     The self-titled debut is a modern-rock pastiche driven by angst (translation: puzzling, angry lyrics) -- brimming with youthful abandon but rife with amateurish mistakes.<P>

     Boasting 14 tracks (one a tedious instrumental, ``Bolero''), the album rides the energy of the fidgety band and the surprisingly husky soul of Maria Nicgorski.<P>

     But every track has a problem, be it the feeling of incompleteness on ``Givin' Way,'' the disjointed structure of ``Fiend'' or the hammered-to-death hook of ``I Am Blinded.''<P>

     Still, it's never so bad that the songs couldn't pass as filler on a more seasoned band's album. And not only is the singer a constant attraction, her band has moments of diversity and maturity, showing appropriate restraint on the enigmatic ``Believe,'' for example, and indulging in a cool psychedelic jam on ``Swingin'.'' <P>

     This isn't Hole or PJ Harvey, but in a few years, who knows?<P>

     Rating: XX 1/2<P>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><em>August 2, 1996</em></td><td valign=top width=470><!--IMAGE--><h2><font size=5>Movie soundtrack is aptly fashionable</font></h2>
<p><em>By Chuck Campbell, News-Sentinel Music Critic</em></p>
<p><strong>``Basquiat'' soundtrack, various acts (Island)</strong></p>
<p>Naturally a film about a hip guy is going to have hip music.</p>
<p>And the forthcoming film ``Basquiat,'' about a real-life graffiti artist who 
becomes an art-world darling in the early '80s, includes a line-up of 
cutting-edge performers from the past two decades.</p>
<p>Even the cast features trendy music names: David Bowie plays Andy 
Warhol, and Courtney Love plays a groupie known as Big Pink. (Jeffrey 
Wright plays the title role in the film written and directed by artist Julian 
Schnabel.)</p>
<p>Bowie also shows up on the soundtrack with his stark ``A Small Plot of 
Land,'' the dullest song on the album.</p>
<p>Mostly a collection of underground classics from the film's time line, the 
soundtrack includes newer songs, too -- among them Tripping Daisy's trippy 
cover of Public Image Ltd.'s? ``Rise'' and a sneering Toadies remake of 
Talking Heads' ``I'm Not in Love.''</p>
<p>The kewlest thing here, however, is a masterpiece -- a PJ Harvey version of 
Peggy Lee's gem ``Is That All There Is.'' Showing absolute restraint, Polly 
Jean Harvey nails the downcast irony of the original in a surreal cloak of 
offbeat (and off kilter), organ-dominated instrumentation. Shaking her usual 
petulant aura, Harvey shifts into an eerie serenity when she croons lines such 
as ``Let's break out the booze and have a ball/If that's all there is.''</p>
<p>The oldie standouts are Grandmaster Flash's groove-heavy ``White Lines 
(Don't Do It)'' and Public Image Ltd.'s punk-manic ``Public Image.'' There 
are also songs by Joy Division (``These Days''), Tom Waits (``Tom 
Traubert's Blues''), John Cale (Hallelujah'') and Pogues (``Summer in 
Siam''). These tracks will be cherished by diehard fans, though frankly, they 
have limited appeal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gavin Friday's recent ``The Last Song I'll Ever Sing'' is 
charmingly quirky, and on ``Suicide Hotline Mode,'' Nick Marion Taylor 
grabs snippets of dialogue and remixes them into an entrancing psychedelic 
hip-hop swirl.</p>
<p>This isn't the kind of soundtrack that will generate a score of hits -- nor is the 
film itself likely to be a blockbuster.</p>
<p>But the better albums (and movies) usually do slip by the mainstream 
unnoticed.</p>
<p>Rating (five possible): * * * *</p>
<p><strong>``Mata Leao,'' Biohazard (Warner Bros.)</strong></p>
<p>The CD player practically spews acid when it's spinning Biohazard's ``Mata 
Leao,'' an over-the-top exercise in aggressive rock.</p>
<p>Having parted ways with guitarist Bobby Hambel (who has been replaced 
by Rob Echeverria), the 8-year-old New York band of Billy Graziadei 
(vocals, guitar), Evan Seinfeld (vocals, bass) and Danny Schuler (drums) 
dips into a toxic collection of raging tracks.</p>
<p>Chugging rhythms and brutal guitars escort the singers through 
standard-issue complaint-rock lyrics that are sort of rapped, sort of 
screamed and ever so slightly sung.</p>
<p>For the most part, it would be futile to try to distinguish the joyless tracks 
(abbreviated pauses between songs make the distinction even less obvious), 
though ``In Vain'' is sluggish by comparison, and ``A Lot To Learn,'' 
``Competition'' and ``A Way'' are a bit more full-throttle than most.</p>
<p>Except for the occasional glimmer of cautious optimism -- the anti-suicide 
message of ``True Strengths,'' for instance -- ``Mata Leao'' is rife with gripes 
about the world (the government, organized religion, people . . . you name it) 
and includes such lines as ``I see no end to this suffering'' (``Better Days''), 
``My soul's too tired, all black and blue'' (``Thorn'') and ``Modern 
democracy: We have no say'' (``Modern Democracy'').</p>
<p>Yes, it's overkill, but the album is a swell angst reliever and quite 
mosh-friendly. Plus it'll drive parents insane.</p>
<p>But ``Mata Leao'' is no award winner.</p>
<p>Rating: * * 1/2</p>
<p><strong>``Flash,'' Red Five (Interscope)</strong></p>
<p>``Hey! Get off of my space,'' warn Betty Carmellini and Jenni McElrath in 
unison at the onset of Red Five's ``Flash.''</p>
<p>It's a great invitation.</p>
<p>The noise-pop quartet -- which includes the women as joint 
vocalists/guitarists as well as Mitchell Townsend on bass and Adam Zuckert 
on drums -- is one of the best bands to emerge from Los Angeles in years.</p>
<p>Comparisons to Veruca Salt, the Muffs, latter-day Lush and numerous other 
groups are inevitable; and true, the band hasn't devised a new sound on its 
debut.</p>
<p>Still, Red Five sounds fresh.</p>
<p>Considering the odd harmonies of the singers, the band sounds more like a 
plugged-in, fired-up Murmurs than the usual mixed-gender modern-rock 
band.</p>
<p>Carmellini and McElrath are far from great vocalists (check out the tracks 
``Turn It On'' and ``In Spite of Me''), but what they lack in fundamentals, 
they make up for in attitude, confidently trading off at lead or dovetailing 
their ordinary voices for strange effect.</p>
<p>Playing at anything from warp speed (``Gasoline,'' ``Your Creation'') to 
mere hyperactivity, the group cashes in with its most energetic outburst in a 
``hidden'' track (``Mr. Universe'') at album's end.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Red Five's sly lyrics tend toward wicked humor -- the title track 
is about a cross-dressing holy man, for example -- and the group makes 
indelible impressions with such infectious refrains as ``It's the way you hold 
me when you hold me down'' (on ``Hold Me Down'').</p>
<p>Fun.</p>

SOUNDTRACK, REPUBLICA, TONI 
BRAXTON</strong></h2>
<p><strong>TUNED IN</strong></p>
<p><em>By CHUCK CAMPBELL, News-Sentinel Music Critic</em></p>
<p>The rating is done on a basis of one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five 
being the highest:</p>
<p>-- THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS, various acts (Miramax/Hollywood)</p>
<p>Another ``Crow'' movie, another soundtrack of stormy alternative music.</p>
<p>But the soundtrack to ``The Crow: City of Angels'' has a twist: a heady flow 
of estrogen countering the rush of testosterone.</p>
<p>This new collection features songs from both sides of the two-headed 
shebeast of modern-rock, Polly Jean Harvey and Courtney Love. PJ 
Harvey grinds out the hard-driving ``Naked Cousin'' powered by Harvey's 
trademark gritty vocals. And Love's band Hole chips in an aggressive 
overhaul of Stevie Nicks' ``Gold Dust Woman'' fueled by the tough empathy 
of Love's singing.</p>
<p>The two songs are easily the best on the soundtrack.</p>
<p>The album also features Harvey/Love wannabes, but kindred souls NY 
Loose (``Spit'') and Lil' Boots (``Pet'') are just pale imitators for now.</p>
<p>As for the guys, Bush produces a suitably apocalyptic ``In a Lonely Place,'' 
a pensively dark number lending a supernatural air to the album. Meanwhile, 
Iggy Pop does a rousing live rendition of his punk classic ``I Wanna Be 
Your Dog.''</p>
<p>There's a semi-successful, not-so-ambient collaboration between Tricky and 
The Gravediggaz (``Tonite Is a Special Nite''), an earnest, albeit rote, slice 
of complaint rock from Seven Mary Three (``Shelf Life'') and a serviceable 
eerie-aspiring rap track from Above the Law featuring Frost (``City of 
Angels'').</p>
<p>But the overlong soundtrack pays too many visits to the trough of 
overindulgent angst -- from the grueling carryings on of Linda Perry and 
Grace Slick (``Knock Me Out'') to the status quo Toadies (``Paper Dress'') 
to the bland Filter (``Jurassitol''). Plus the album gets downright ugly with a 
pair of comically ersatz Metallica contributions, Korn's ``Sean Olson'' and 
Deftones' ``Teething.''</p>
<p>Fortunately, the soundtrack isn't the exclusive domain of calculated sneers: 
White Zombie's raging cover of KC and the Sunshine Band's ``I'm Your 
Boogieman'' is a refreshing blast of funk/metal fun.</p>
<p>Rating (five possible): XXX</p>
<p>-- REPUBLICA, Republica (RCA)</p>
<p>Republica makes unconventional use of conventionalism.</p>
<p>The British act's debut glides through inviting techno-pop with a keen sense 
of club-friendly grooves. But rather than plop the requisite diva at the helm, 
core members Tim Dorney and Andy Todd strayed out to grab Saffron as 
their lead vocalist.</p>
<p>The saucy singer brings a modern-rock edge to the mix, emphasizing attitude 
over vocal grandstanding.</p>
<p>Vaguely reminiscent of Bow Wow Wow's 
girl-group-meets-beat-conscious-rock sound, Republica is a combination of 
divergent familiarity -- a theoretical collaboration between Elastica, 
Bananarama and Erasure.</p>
<p>It's a faintly cheesy synth-based sound, too, but that doesn't detract from the 
enjoyment.</p>
<p>``Republica'' springs out with jittery electronic rhythms, slamming beats, the 
occasional guitar riff and Saffron's sass on the contagious single ``Ready To 
Go.''</p>
<p>Undaunted by the careening cadences, she sings swell hooks about wanting 
everything (``Bitch''), the allure of a deceitful hunk (``Drop Dead 
Gorgeous''), fear of abandonment (``Don't You Ever'') and dreams of 
escaping mundanity (``Get Off'' and ``Out of the Darkness'').</p>
<p>Other than the drowsy slow-down track ``Picture Me,'' ``Republica'' is a 
consistent album -- perhaps due to the band's limitations more than anything. 
But the redundancy never fails to entertain.</p>
<p>Rating: XXXX</p>
<p>-- SECRETS, Toni Braxton (LaFace)</p>
<p>It's no secret that Toni Braxton is a gifted singer. It's just too bad she wastes 
her talent on superficiality.</p>
<p>The shallow pabulum of Braxton's ``Secrets'' makes Mariah Carey seem like 
a prophet. And the fact the album is so grossly manipulated in the studio 
makes it almost creepy.</p>
<p>Even superpolished adult contemporary songs have their place on the 
airwaves, proven by Braxton's sultry current hit ``You're Makin Me High,'' a 
theme song for summer sensuality.</p>
<p>But ``Secrets'' chokes on the thick sheen of glossy production and insipid 
songwriting, and Braxton's attempt to inject soul in the album doesn't redeem 
it.</p>
<p>Penned mostly by Babyface, ``Secrets'' has such pearls of wisdom as ``Tell 
me why should I care about doing my hair when I can't stop thinking about 
you'' (from ``There's No Me Without You'').</p>
<p>But nothing compares to the embarrassing debacle of ``Talking in His 
Sleep,'' which the singer herself wrote. Here she coos about ``the affair'' -- a 
minor sin compared to the breathy chatter of a singer turned dork. (Put 
down the pen, Ms. Braxton, and step away from the microphone before 
somebody gets hurt.)</p>
<p>Other than the hit single, there are a (very) few nice touches -- the Spanish 
guitar on the ballad ``Un-Break My Heart,'' for example, and the folkish 
leanings of ``Let It Flow.''</p>
<p>But mostly the songs bounce from overwrought to flat with little in between 
to enjoy.</p>
<p>Rating: XX</p>

ELECTRONIC, RASPUTINA</h2>
<p><strong>TUNED IN</strong></p>
<p><em>By CHUCK CAMPBELL, Scripps Howard News Service</em></p>
<p>The rating is done on a basis of one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five 
being the highest:</p>
<p>-- LIMBO, Throwing Muses (Ryko)</p>
<p>Kristin Hersh is getting soft.</p>
<p>This is good news: The leader of Rhode Island's Throwing Muses had been 
navigating her remarkable band through rough waters lately, resulting in 
harsh albums almost too bitter to enjoy.</p>
<p>Although she may have mellowed slightly, Hersh is hardly a patsy. The 
Throwing Muses' new ``Limbo'' is loaded with edgy excitement, the kind of 
nervous uncertainty characteristic of a decade of outstanding Muses releases 
-- including 1987's ``The Fat Skier,'' 1988's ``House Tornado'' and 1991's 
``The Real Ramona,'' three of the best albums of the modern rock era.</p>
<p>After ``The Real Ramona,'' Hersh's step-sister, Tanya Donelly, quit the 
band, doing a stint with the Breeders before founding her own group, Belly.</p>
<p>Donelly was a secondary contributor to Muses material, but her few songs 
were an important sweet counterpoint to Hersh's engrossing, but 
excruciating, psychosis.</p>
<p>Sans Donelly, the Muses released 1992's ``Red Heaven'' and 1995's 
``University'' -- superb recordings, but too acidic. (Hersh's 1994 solo 
album, ``Hips and Makers,'' was an anomaly, but the understated, 
string-based nature of the release made it an altogether different animal from 
any Muses recording.)</p>
<p>Now the always surprising Hersh finds new direction in ``Limbo,'' exploring 
humor that isn't quit so caustic and even pausing for occasional optimism 
with ``Serene'' and a ``hidden'' closing track.</p>
<p>Hersh and her band (drummer David Narcizo and bassist Bernard Georges) 
playfully careen along the sing-songy ``Ruthie's Knocking,'' sashay through 
the C&amp;W-tinged ``Tar Kisses'' and shift to the seductively simple ``Night 
Driving.'' The sound is more focused and crisp than past efforts, but just as 
multi-faceted. And instantly rewarding rhythms and hooks are everywhere.</p>
<p>As usual with Hersh, there's a feeling of intrusion in listening to these songs -- 
something like peeping in the windows of an insane asylum just long enough 
to see something's terribly wrong, but not knowing what before moving on to 
the next window (song) . . . ``I never asked you to pay the rent/Jesus Christ, 
my lips are red'' she sings on ``Cowbirds,'' and on ``Freeloader'' she 
proclaims ``I'm an open book! I'm an open book!'' (Yeah, but what 
language is that book in?)</p>
<p>There's wry fussiness on ``The Field,'' an enticing S&amp;M overtone to 
``Tango'' and frustrated pain on ``Mr. Bones.'' All the while, Hersh switches 
from raspy vulnerability to unmitigated anger, stirring both pathos and 
anxiety.</p>
<p>Complex and compelling, ``Limbo'' is an excellent achievement.</p>
<p>Rating (five possible): XXXXX</p>
<p>-- RAISE THE PRESSURE, Electronic (Warner Bros.)</p>
<p>Electronic's ``Raise the Pressure'' falls below expectations.</p>
<p>Bernard Sumner and Johnny Marr have taken six years since their 
ballyhooed debut to get this second album out, and it's unspectacular.</p>
<p>That's a bit of a shock considering their stellar credentials (Sumner's with 
New Order and Marr was lead guitarist for The Smiths) and a guest line-up 
that includes Kraftwerk keyboardist Karl Bartos and Primal Scream vocalist 
Denise Johnson.</p>
<p>But the jangly melancholia and discreetly humming bassline of ``Forbidden 
City'' don't amount to much pizzazz for a first single. And the Britpop sound 
of the wimpy ``For You,'' the subtle ``One Day'' and the politely wistful 
``Out of My League'' aren't much better, though the lumbering hook of 
``Second Nature'' is unusually infectious.</p>
<p>Reflecting the diverse backgrounds of Sumner and Marr, ``Raise the 
Pressure'' has a split personality, sprinkling synthetic dance songs among the 
prudent pop numbers.</p>
<p>Yet even with pushed-up, emphasized rhythms, the twosome sound like 
they're sleepwalking through several of these tracks, including ``Freefall,'' 
``How Long'' and ``Time Can Tell.''</p>
<p>The throbbing ``Dark Angel'' and the rumbling techno of the celebratory 
``Until the End of Time'' are relative breakthroughs compared to the other 
songs, infusions of high energy that make their mark on an unremarkable 
album.</p>
<p>However, these highlight tracks aren't anything New Order hasn't done 
before, and better.</p>
<p>Rating: XX</p>
<p>-- THANKS FOR THE ETHER, Rasputina (Columbia)</p>
<p>The group Rasputina has a clearly defined niche: gothic waifs and 
gothic-waif followers.</p>
<p>Still, this band of three women cello players will have to camp out beside the 
modern-rock highway because there are no vacancies for their kind along 
that ever-more-structured road. And there's no other path for Rasputina to 
take in its search for fame and fortune -- its music is too scary for the Top 
40, too freakish for adult alternative, clearly not dance-oriented and a world 
apart from classical music (despite the cellos).</p>
<p>Frontwoman Melora Creager (who is both lead vocalist and songwriter as 
well as a cellist) played her instrument as part of Nirvana's last tour of 
Europe. But don't look for Kurt Cobain's influence on ``Thanks for the 
Ether.''</p>
<p>Instead, there's a little Kate Bush and Jane Siberry floating around, as on the 
servant's tale ``Stumpside,'' sung with fragile grace as the women 
dramatically saw away on their cellos. And there are a few humorous 
performance-art pieces a la Meryn Cadell -- a (drunk?) country woman's 
observations (``Nozzle''), a comparison of the Donner Party to America's 
first settlers (``The Donner Party'') and a little tale about insects who form 
their own company, but need backing (``Five Fleas'').</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there are rushed vocals over a languid cello backdrop on the 
phantasmagoric ``Transylvania Concubine,'' and ``My Little Shirtwaist Fire'' 
is an arsonist's dream. Appropriately backhanded tributes are paid to 
eccentrics Howard Hughes and Ophelia (the suicidal gal in Shakespeare's 
``Hamlet''), but the much-anticipated song about Rasputin will have to wait 
for another album.</p>
<p>Perhaps most bizarre are a pair of cover songs -- the 1943 Benny 
Goodman/Peggy Lee standard ``Why Don't You Do Right?'' and Melanie's 
1971 hit ``Brand New Key,'' both of which retain original melodies but are 
processed through that strange marriage of cellos and offbeat vocals.</p>
<p>The unreal feeling of the Rasputina sound eventually grows tiresome as 
``Thanks for the Ether'' staggers to a close. But the journey to that numbing 
conclusion is marked by some fascinating moments.</p>
<p>Rating: XXX 1/2</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><em>August 23, 1996</em></td><td valign=top width=470><!--IMAGE--><h2>Frente's sound takes 'Shape' </h2>
<p><strong>&quot;Shape,'' Frente (Mammoth)</strong> </p>
<p>While most new bands dread the sophomore slump, frente is blessed with a 
sophomore rebound. </p>
<p>The Australian band's 1994 debut, ``Marvin: The Album,'' was an awful 
exercise in wimpy pop that managed to churn out two hits -- the curious 
acoustic remake of New Order's ``Bizarre Love Triangle'' and the 
inconsequential ``Labour of Love.'' </p>
<p>Lead singer Angie Hart was 18 when ``Marvin'' was recorded, though she 
sounded about 12. Her childlike voice, combined with naive lyrics and 
lightweight instrumentation, didn't amount to much of a beginning for frente 
(or frente! as they dubbed themselves at first, apparently in a quest for 
excitement). </p>
<p>Hart's voice is still girlish, but the group has matured considerably with its 
second release, ``Shape.'' There's more depth to the sound and more 
maturity to the words, reflected by dark-edged ambiguity. </p>
<p>Vestiges of frente's meek background remain in the nebulous feeling of the 
half-baked tracks ``Safe From You,'' ``Burning Girl'' and ``So Mad.'' Still, 
some of the leanest songs are fairly interesting -- such as the bittersweet 
``Clue'' and the melodic ``Harm.'' </p>
<p>``Sit on My Hands'' is an ambitious first single, an experiment in synthetic 
trip-hop that is perplexingly wordy, yet lugubriously paced. </p>
<p>At least they tried. </p>
<p>More appealing are jaunty slices of pop, such as ``Jungle'' and ``The 
Destroyer.'' </p>
<p>Better still is the electric ``What's Come Over Me,'' a Cranberries-esque 
ebb-and-flow modern rocker, and the melancholy ``Goodbye Goodguy,'' on 
which a disenchanted Hart sings, ``Everything perfect you said was just 
mirrors and wires.'' </p>
<p>Best of all is the track ``Air,'' an ominous song with an uncharacteristically 
pronounced rhythm. Here Hart makes her most convincing stand, uneasily 
observing a bad vibe of sad meaninglessness in those around her. </p>
<p>Frente has lots of room to grow, but the group has made impressive 
progress in a relatively short span. </p>
<p>Rating (five possible): * * * </p>
<p><strong>``The Pink Album,'' Tuscadero (Elektra)</strong> </p>
<p>Rather than have the Washington, D.C., band Tuscadero record an all-new 
album for its first Elektra release, the record company saw promise in the 
group's overlooked 1994 debut ``The Pink Album,'' so that record has been 
remixed, partly re-recorded and re-released. </p>
<p>Now with Elektra's backing, ``The Pink Album'' will reach a broad 
audience, and perhaps Tuscadero will get the following it deserves. </p>
<p>Melissa Farris (vocals, guitars), Margaret McCartney (guitars, vocals), Phil 
Satlof (bass) and Jack Hornady (drums) collectively have a child's mentality, 
yet they're driven by adult desires. </p>
<p>Framing such impulses as lust and jealousy with juvenile points of reference, 
Tuscadero offers a potent sound, bridging power pop to modern rock. </p>
<p>``Hollywood Handsome'' is a prime leadoff single, though the censors had to 
clean it up for airplay. The buzzing go-go rhythm takes Farris and 
McCartney (who both sing) on a thrill ride as they fight back their cravings 
for a superficial, promiscuous, stupid, vain stud (``Not much upstairs, but 
what a body!''). Their exultant decision: Go for it before he gets away. </p>
<p>In other highlights, rolling drums lead to an electric fire on ``Heat Lightnin','' a 
winking chorus belies ``Lovesick,'' and a bounding beat on 
``Dime-a-Dozen'' is a clever backdrop for smarty-pants insults -- ``You 
know your daddy must've married his first cousin/And guys like you are a 
dime a dozen.'' </p>
<p>There are comparisons of love to candy (``Candy Song'') and relationships 
to games (``Game Song''), and there's a backhanded tribute to a 
not-so-pleasant neighborhood, ``Mount Pleasant.'' And when mom throws 
out Farris' Nancy Drew books, you know she'll pay. </p>
<p>But despite the quasi-cute nature of the songs (``I drew a picture with my 
own two hands/Just something simple that my eyes could understand,'' Farris 
sings on ``Crayola''), tracks such as the chugging ``Latex Dominatrix'' are 
around to remind listeners the band members are very much wry adults. </p>
<p>The band and the album title get their names from the ``Happy Days'' 
character Pinky Tuscadero, played by Suzi Quatro, which the group 
acknowledges with the loving ``Leather Idol'' -- though the idea of the song 
is more fun than the execution. </p>
<p>In fact, this loud, fuzzy album doesn't always impress as Tuscadero blurs 
obvious inspiration from a number of forerunners into a derivative brew. </p>
<p>Yet they aren't pretending to be profound rock geniuses; they're just a group 
of savvy musicians who know how to have a good time. </p>
<p>Rating: * * * * </p>
<p><strong>``Blue Cave,'' Hoodoo Gurus (Zoo)</strong> </p>
<p>Thirteen years later, the Hoodoo Gurus still have something to contribute to 
progressive rock. </p>
<p>Not that the Australian group's seventh album, ``Blue Cave,'' is 
groundbreaking. It's simply that the record is sprinkled with enough 
airplay-worthy tracks to merit a spot in the rotation among contemporary 
chart masters. And given the fresh enthusiasm of some of the songs, you'd 
never know what old geezers these guys are. </p>
<p>The infectious crunching rock of ``Down on Me'' is a resounding example: A 
shouting group vocal reiterates lead singer Dave Faulkner's notion that 
``Everybody is down on me . . . Even Mr. T is down on me!'' </p>
<p>Produced by Charles Fisher (who produced the band's 1985 breakthrough 
album, ``Mars Needs Guitars''), ``Blue Cave'' is a balanced mix of 
aggressive hooks and buzzing rhythms. From the invigorating beat of ``Mine'' 
to the catchy universality of ``Waking Up Tired'' (``I need a good vacation 
from too much recreation''), the Hoodoo Gurus do more than merely stay 
afloat. </p>
<p>Faulkner and guitarist Brad Shepherd also maintain something of an edge to 
their songwriting: ``Night Must Fall,'' for instance, sounds like a carefree, 
acoustic-driven ditty, but the touching lyrics are actually about the 
heartbreak of losing a friend. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, ``All I Know'' (with Shepherd at lead vocal) is rote 
romanticism, the opening ``Big Deal'' is just alternative noise (no big deal 
indeed), ``Son-of-a-Gun'' is a lame man-in-prison song, and ``Mind the 
Spider'' is a silly art-rock disaster. </p>
<p>Other insubstantial tracks are at least fueled by liveliness, including ``Always 
Something,'' ``Why?'' and the album's first single, ``If Only . . .'' </p>
<p>The Hoodoo Gurus recognize that even the throwaways need a reason to 
exist. And those instincts have served the band well. </p>
<p>Rating: * * * 1/2 </p>

BETTER THAN EZRA</h2>
<p><strong>TUNED IN</strong></p>
<p><em>By CHUCK CAMPBELL, Knoxville News-Sentinel music critic</em></p>
<p>The rating is done on a basis of one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five 
being the highest:</p>
<p>-- BEAUTIFUL FREAK, eels (DreamWorks)</p>
<p>``Beautiful Freak'' is a manifesto for dejected misfits, a well-designed, 
intelligent album from the eels.</p>
<p>Led by E (Mike Edwards) -- who had previously released ``A Man Called 
(e) and ``Broken Toy Shop'' -- the Los Angeles band also features Butch 
(Norton) on drums and Tommy (Walter) on bass.</p>
<p>Though sometimes sluggish, ``Beautiful Freak'' poetically handles downcast 
material with surprising invention, meshing together insinuating street beats 
with lush pop layers and pretty melody lines.</p>
<p>``Novocaine for the Soul,'' the first song and a hit single, brushes on what 
``Beautiful Freak'' is all about . . . a toy piano provides segues to 
understated verses and dreamy refrains about a need to numb the soul.</p>
<p>Beyond ``Novocaine for the Soul,'' ``Flower'' combines country twinges 
with an eerie choir; a harmonica finds its way onto ``Guest List''; and ``Rags 
to Rags'' is obnoxiously fuzzy. And there's a Wings-y aura to the constantly 
shifting ``Susan's House,'' a narration on the disquieting sites to be seen in 
the Echo Park area of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the title track and its companion piece, ``My Beloved Monster,'' 
are offbeat, but loving tributes. Sings E: ``My beloved monster is tough/If 
she wants, she will destroy you/But if you lay her down for a kiss/Her little 
heart, it could explode.''</p>
<p>It's the mixture of anxiety, vulnerability and outrage that propels this album, 
and it's all underscored by compassionate understanding -- whether it's a 
tender profile of an orphan (``Spunky'') or a fitful struggle with feelings of 
doom (``Not Ready Yet'').</p>
<p>E's beleaguered gravely voice brings the album to a conclusion that is both 
comforting and depressing, consoling a miserable woman with disarmingly 
sweet support on the lullaby ``Manchild.''</p>
<p>Perhaps not for the well-adjusted, the eels are kindred souls for those 
walking the dark side.</p>
<p>Rating (five possible): XXXX</p>
<p>-- NEARLY GOD, Nearly God (Durban Poison/Island Independents)</p>
<p>There's a double-dose of Tricky coming on the heels of the music 
innovator's much-lauded debut release, ``Maxinquaye.''</p>
<p>He's set to release ``Pre-Millennium Tension'' in October, but meanwhile he 
offers the new ``Nearly God'' under the pseudonym Nearly God.</p>
<p>The Tricky question is: What now?</p>
<p>Discarding the basic foundations of popular music, he builds his songs on 
entrancing rhythm loops and varied vocals.</p>
<p>Tricky may have devised a new way of making music, but now listeners will 
have to learn a new way of appreciating it: There are no sing-along choruses, 
few dance-friendly rhythms and no instrumental melodies worth 
remembering. There is only filler noise for an unoccupied mind.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, the music is too jarring to be of any meditative 
use.</p>
<p>Tricky opens ``Nearly God'' by converting Siouxsie &amp; The Banshees' 
``Tattoo'' into a dark dreamscape layered atop a mechanical churn, and he 
closes with a shuffling cover of rapper Slick Rick's ``Children's Story,'' 
hinged to a strange talk/sing vocal by Martina Tooley Bird (an unemotional 
rendition quite at odds with the charismatic Slick Rick).</p>
<p>The rest of the album is comprised of Tricky originals, often stark 
arrangements that limp along through deconstructed formats or latch to 
uneasy quirks and elastic, repetitive rhythms. The processed exotica of ``I 
Sing for You'' is an interesting exception, and resonating bass is an 
occasional wake-up call.</p>
<p>Guest vocals range from the full-bodied sounds of Alison Moyet and Neneh 
Cherry (who literally seems to be phoning in her performance on ``Together 
Now''), to the straight-ahead pop delivery of Terry Hall. The endearingly 
eccentric Bjork (who has used Tricky's services in her own recordings) 
makes a couple of appearances, and the Bjork-ish Bird makes several 
more. Plus Tricky himself is frequently at the mike, distantly mumbling or 
singing faintly.</p>
<p>It's a gratifyingly unusual adventure -- temporarily. But although it might 
generate a provocative pause, ``Nearly God'' doesn't have enough to 
provide sustained stimulation of a normal alert mind. And while Tricky may 
be a pioneer, it seems he's leading music down a dead end.</p>
<p>Rating: XX 1/2</p>
<p>-- FRICTION, BABY, Better Than Ezra (Elektra)</p>
<p>Better Than Ezra's ``Friction, Baby'' lacks personality.</p>
<p>The modern-rock band that rose through the indie ranks on the strength of 
its ``Good'' hit single is now a major-label player without character.</p>
<p>Vocalist/guitarist Kevin Griffin and bassist Tom Drummond return with new 
drummer Travis McNabb, who replaces founding member Cary Bonnecaze.</p>
<p>The three men have the sense to vary the sound on ``Friction, Baby,'' and 
they aren't exactly amateurs on their instruments. But they fail to come up 
with anything to distinguish them from the field.</p>
<p>For example, although Griffin puts a plaintive touch on his vocals, he could 
be almost anyone at the microphone. And despite the crushing guitars and 
rhythms of the more emphatic tracks, Better Than Ezra strikes worn-out 
chords.</p>
<p>After a few energized opening songs (including ``King of New Orleans''), the 
album settles into the softer (and more trite) ``Normal Town'' and then the 
agreeable melodies of the even lower-key ``Scared, Are You?''</p>
<p>From there, the album kicks around a number of tempos and styles with little 
success: A funky vibe doesn't rescue ``Still Life With Cooley'' from ultimate 
boredom, and droning Hornsby-esque keyboards are a fatal addition to 
``WWOZ.''</p>
<p>Other tracks show traces of promise, but the potential is mostly unfulfilled, 
dashed by Griffin's penchant for the maudlin and an overall lack of 
originality.</p>
<p>Better Than Ezra may have paid its dues through years of playing in bars, but 
that alone doesn't entitle the band to wild prosperity.</p>
<p>The group needs imagination and flavor to deserve that.</p>
<p>Rating: XX</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><em>September 6, 1996</em></td><td valign=top width=470><!--IMAGE--><h2>NEW RELEASES: PEARL JAM, THE 
JERKY BOYS, LEAH ANDREONE</h2>
<h3><u>TUNED IN</u></h3>
<p><em>By CHUCK CAMPBELL, News-Sentinel music critic</em></p>
<p>The rating is done on a basis of one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five 
being the highest:</p>
<p>-- NO CODE, Pearl Jam (Epic)</p>
<p>Pearl Jam's ``No Code'' has no consistency, but at least the Seattle band 
isn't stagnant.</p>
<p>Eddie Vedder and company are moving on, jumping from one mood and 
sound to the next while distancing themselves from the grunge-rock pack at 
every turn. And even if the ``No Code'' jumble is sometimes off target, at 
least Vedder isn't monotonously brooding</p>
<p>To be sure, he DOES brood, opening the album with his trademark pained 
warble on the bare ``Sometimes.'' But then he careens into ``Hail, Hail'' -- a 
basic cynical-about-love song set to surprisingly vapid instrumentation, 
though Vedder stamps an agreeable vocal imprint on the track.</p>
<p>There are frenzied moments in the raw electric jam of ``Habit'' and the 
disturbingly angry ``Lukin,'' countered by the dreamy illusion of ``I'm Open'' 
and the soothing acoustic ballad ``Around the Bend,'' which closes the 
album with a combination of Latin and country nuance.</p>
<p>Yet ambivalent endings hamper some tracks -- including the twangy single 
``Who Are You'' (which succeeds with a rumbling beat, ragtag backing 
vocals and a transcendental break) and ``In My Tree'' (where Vedder takes 
a good nugget of a song and pierces it with arching overwrought vocals).</p>
<p>Although Pearl Jam slogs through stretches of ``No Code'' with little 
distinction (``Red Mosquito'' and ``Present Tense''), the band hits stride 
midway with ``Smile'' and ``Off He Goes.'' The former taps into a well of 
inspiration with its grainy groove and clomping beat, and the latter is a 
Springsteen-sounding slow song with exceptional guitar melodies.</p>
<p>Varied songwriting efforts by band members account for differences from 
track to track -- guitarist Stone Gossard's up-tempo ``Mankind'' is 
unexpectedly breezy and out of step with Vedder's heavier hand, for 
example. And Vedder's lyrics can be remarkably insubstantial, which casts 
some doubt on this band's importance in the overall history of rock.</p>
<p>However, ``No Code'' further establishes Pearl Jam as an independent force 
in the post-Seattle Sound era. </p>
<p>Rating (five possible): XXXX</p>
<p>-- THE JERKY BOYS 3, The Jerky Boys (Mercury)</p>
<p>Although their popularity is on the wane, the Jerky Boys give it another go 
with ``The Jerky Boys 3.''</p>
<p>A few years ago, Johnny Brennan and Kamal achieved a cult following with 
a compilation of prank phone calls that was passed around and bootlegged 
for some time before finally finding legitimacy via the duo's debut, ``The 
Jerky Boys.''</p>
<p>As usual with something of this nature, the Jerky Boys went from faceless 
underground icons to shameless self-promoters, making commercials, MTV 
station-IDs, a second album and even a movie (which was a monumental 
flop last year).</p>
<p>``The Jerky Boys 3'' milks whatever's left of their popularity by bringing 
back their best characters -- the temperamental Frank Rizzo, the endearingly 
obtuse Sol Rosenberg, the flighty and effeminate Jack Tors and the 
incomprehensible Tarbash.</p>
<p>They also offer new characters, but these aren't likely to connect because at 
this point the Jerky Boys only have nostalgic appeal. Those who bother with 
``The Jerky Boys 3'' are probably looking to relive the shock of first hearing 
the aggressive pranks. But like most sequels, this one suffers from 
diminishing returns.</p>
<p>What's more, the twosome didn't find very good victims. Other than a 
hapless woman who tries to help Sol cope with a devastating injury (on 
``Sol's Chainsaw Shock'' and ``Chainsaw Shock (Part 2)'') and a friendly 
theater owner who apparently sees through the hoax (on ``Stop That''), most 
of the subjects won't stand for the hostility or try to understand the bizarre 
set-ups. Without good-natured targets, the Jerky Boys can't improvise very 
well, and their characters are merely obnoxious.</p>
<p>Even the more clever scenarios -- Sol describing a Civil War boot with a 
soldier's foot still in it, Jack relating misinformation he's heard about a 
surgery-free facelift procedure -- pale compare to the ideas Brennan and 
Kamal had when the Jerky Boys were fresher.</p>
<p>The concept has run its course.</p>
<p>Rating: XX</p>
<p>-- VEILED, Leah Andreone (RCA)</p>
<p>Alanis Morissette fans impatient for the follow-up to ``Jagged Little Pill'' 
might be tempted to turn to Leah Andreone's ``Veiled'' for a quick fix.</p>
<p>Like Morissette, the 23-year-old San Diego native is an emotional 
philosopher who's pent up with hostility, but banking on hope.</p>
<p>Unlike ``Jagged Little Pill,'' however, ``Veiled'' is flat.</p>
<p>Andreone indulges her nasal voice in fits similar to Morissette's, but her 
stunts seem more shrewdly calculated than charmingly eccentric.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the instrumentation is only dressed-up folk music -- and average 
folk music at that.</p>
<p>When she ditches her grating intonation, Andreone can be quite the songbird 
(as on ``Mother Tongue'' and ``Imagining You''). But she can't stop trumping 
up her role as damsel.</p>
<p>She lays it on thick on ``Problem Child,'' for instance, singing to 
unresponsive parents, ``Why won't you pay attention/Hung from a rope, 
then you'll know me.'' And if she isn't threatening suicide, she's nagging a 
lover to go ahead and leave her on ``Kiss Me Goodbye'' (presumably she's 
too weak to take an active role in her relationships) or otherwise pining 
away in self-pity.</p>
<p>This isn't a terrible album; Andreone's lyrics are as amusing as decent 
high-school poetry, and her presentation is incomplete, not slipshod.</p>
<p>But ``Veiled'' isn't quite the breakthrough like those recently released by 
Jewel and Tracy Bonham. And Andreone simply doesn't touch Morissette.</p>
<p>Rating: XX</p>

<HEAD><TITLE>"NEW" IS MISNOMER FOR R.E.M.'S LATEST</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><A HREF="/"><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="A Publication of News-Sentinel Online" BORDER=0></A><center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><H2>"NEW" IS MISNOMER FOR R.E.M.'S LATEST</H2>

TUNED IN<P>

<i>By Chuck Campbell, News-Sentinel music critic</i><p>

     NEW ADVENTURES IN HI-FI, R.E.M. (Warner Bros.)<P>

     Time seems to be slipping away on R.E.M. Not because of the band members' physical hardships: Rather, the group is running in place as upstart bands sprint by with fresher sounds, inventive melodies and new perspectives.  <P>

     Many of today's modern-rock stars never would have gotten major-label contracts if not for the enormous strides R.E.M. made bringing alternative music to the mainstream. The Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam, Hole, Everclear, Stone Temple Pilots: All of them (and hundreds others) might be toiling away as indies if R.E.M. hadn't paved the way.<P>

     But the fact is they DO have those contracts, and at this point they're simply more interesting than their beloved predecessor.<P>

     By now, we're all accustomed to Michael Stipe's angst, and ``New Adventures in Hi-Fi'' is more of the same -- only a little more sour. <P>

     Plus the album isn't particularly robust. ``New Adventures in Hi-Fi'' is a mix of live recordings made from the band's ``Monster'' tour concerts and sound checks  as well as a few studio tracks and one song recorded in a dressing room (the instrumental ``Zither''). The result is a smudgy hodgepodge of indistinct songs.<P>

     Sure, it's R.E.M. -- Stipe, Peter Buck, Mike Mills and Bill Berry -- and it still sounds like R.E.M. But it has that perfunctory ``sound check'' feel of a band going through the motions just to try out the equipment. <P>

     The subtle ``How the West Was Won and Where It Got Us,'' featuring a particularly bad Mills piano solo, is an inauspicious opening. However, the band rebounds with raw urgency on ``The Wake-Up Bomb,'' an electric ``Undertow'' and an ensuing set of solid (if familiar) performances the rest of the way.<P>

     Meanwhile, Stipe offers downcast musings (theological and otherwise) on ``New Test Leper,'' mopes through ``Leave'' and is in a general dispirited state throughout. If he were more despairing or angry or sardonic, he could be compelling. Instead, he's like the whiny coworker who never stops complaining. (``Stand'' was such a long time ago, wasn't it?)<P>

     The atmosphere works well sometimes -- as on the mellotron- and Moog synthesizer-supported meditative single ``E-Bow the Letter,'' which includes potent backing vocals by Patti Smith. And the depressing mood gets a small break at album's end with the beguiling, full-bodied ``Electrolite.''<P>

     Yet the album is mostly generic darkness.<P>

     In a time when traditional rock icons are faltering (Did anyone notice Prince recently released a new one?), R.E.M. is likely to maintain lofty status with ``New Adventures in Hi-Fi.'' Even if only hardcore fans buy the album, it'll sell millions.<P>

     Rating (five possible): XXX<P>

     <P>

     -- BILINGUAL, Pet Shop Boys (Atlantic)<P>

     More than a decade after their defining hit single  ``West End Girls,'' the Pet Shop Boys are still plugging along with the release of their eighth album, ``Bilingual.''<P>

     The duo of Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe never released another song with quite the mystical aura of that first smash, but worthy follow-ups included ``Love Comes Quickly,'' ``What Have I Done To Deserve This?'' and ``Always on My Mind.''<P>

     Mainly because the pop scene moved away from the Pet Shop Boys' wall-of-synthesizer sound, in later years the twosome's hits have been more rare and less substantial.<P>

     Admirably, Tennant and Lowe have eschewed scurrying after trends, sticking close to the style they helped innovate. In fact, ``Bilingual'' is not far removed from ``Please'' (the ``West End Girls'' album), and sometimes it sounds remarkably fresh.<P>

     Solid neo-disco grooves underscore ``Saturday Night Forever,'' ``To Step Aside'' and ``Red Letter Day'' (which features supporting vocals by The Choral Academy of Moscow), and the sunny dance/pop of ``Before'' already has become a club hit.<P>

     The crescendo of keyboards and grinding beat of ``Discotecca'' combine for an evocative atmosphere that's almost as good as any Tennant and Lowe have produced, and that song craftily segues into the shuffling up-tempo march of ``Single.''<P>

     Meanwhile, Tennant -- who sings in a distinctive nasal lilt -- is as wry as ever, satirizing a man about the world on ``Single'' and mocking lip-synchers on ``Electricity'' (``Call it performance, call it art/I call it disaster if the tapes don't start''). And on a more serious topic, ``Metamorphosis'' is a rather clear coming-to-terms with being gay. <P>

     At the same time, Tennant is drunk with love on ``It Always Comes as a Surprise'' and unabashedly optimistic on ``Before'' and ``Se A Vida E'' (``Why do you want to sit alone in gothic gloom?'').<P>

     The downside of the status quo music is that other than showing off a few Latin influences (hence the album title), ``Bilingual'' demonstrates no growth. And it's bogged down  when tracks such as ``Up Against It'' and ``The Survivors'' slave away in listless anonymity.<P>

     However, if pop revivalists are ready to re-celebrate the Pet Shop Boys, Tennant and Lowe are armed with potential new hit singles. And even if ``Bilingual'' goes unnoticed by the mainstream, it'll likely be hanging out in the clubs.<P>

     Rating: XXX 1/2<P>

     -- ONE IN A MILLION, Aaliyah (Blackground)<P>

     Despite several major flaws, Aaliyah's ``One in a Million'' shows the singer may have what it takes to break away from the pack of one-name R&B teen divas that also includes Brandy and Monica.<P>

     Only 14 when she recorded her gold single ``Back & Forth,'' the native New Yorker is 17 now, a senior at Detroit's Performing Arts High School.<P>

     Her voice is in fine shape on her second album, and during her remake of Marvin Gaye's ``Got To Give It Up'' (which includes a terrific guest rap by Slick Rick), she appears to be heir apparent to Janet Jackson -- in fact, she's way ahead of where Jackson was at her age.<P>

     But just as Jackson soared when producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis took over and molded her style, Aaliyah likewise needs help behind the boards.<P>

     As it is, she's at the mercy of entirely too many producers and songwriters who are neither consistent with each other nor consistently good.<P>

     She deftly handles the predatory groove of ``Hot Like Fire,'' simmers on the meditative cover of the Isley Brothers' ``Choosey Lover and slinks along the silky jazz undertones of ``4 Page Letter.''<P>

     Aaliyah also performs above the level of lesser material -- lulling through the hypnotic drone of ``Heartbroken'' and cooing through the basic ``Ladies in Da House.''<P>

     But there's only so much a teen with limited experience and power can do to salvage the routine R&B filler that dominates this album (which, incidentally, clocks in at an excessive 73 minutes). She's disgraced by the fake ``live'' track ``Never Comin' Back'' (when will producers realize how foolish this makes singers sound?), and she's buried by the mushy melancholia of the Diane Warren-penned ``The One I Gave My Heart To.''<P>

     Unfortunately, a half dozen other pointless songs also conspire in the mediocrity, making ``One in a Million'' sound like one OF a million.<P>

     Rating: XX 1/2<P>

Enigmatic love shades Germano's 'Circus'</font><p><!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Byline Here--><font size=2><i>By Chuck Campbell, News-Sentinel music critic</i></font></p>
<p><!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Dateline Here--><br>
<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->''Excerpts From a Love Circus,'' Lisa Germano (4AD) </p>
<p>Lisa Germano has recovered from her brush with fatalism on ''Geek the 
Girl,'' but she's hardly all right. </p>
<p>Gone is the woman who longed for ''cancer of everything'' so she could get 
attention, and in her place is a woman singing about love on ''Excerpts From 
a Love Circus.'' </p>
<p>But while most love songs assign specific emotions to the protagonist, Lisa 
Germano's are fitfully complex -- so much so that love seems more like a 
psychological disorder than a healthy emotion. </p>
<p>That explains ''Beautiful Schizophrenic'' -- a song both soothing and 
disquieting as uneasy strings support Germano's musings about ''a couple of 
schizophrenics trying to figure out which one is which.'' </p>
<p>Sounding like a breathless child with a spacey, sing-song delivery, Germano 
presides over some problematic proceedings. </p>
<p>On ''Bruises'' she gives herself a soft fiddle foundation for lines such as 
''Coffee in the morning and wine in the evening/And everything else is boring, 
boring . . . You are a nothing/But all I can think of is you.'' She delivers a 
backhanded tribute with clangy support on ''I Love a Snot,'' but her relative 
cheerfulness fades into unsettling gloom on ''Forget It, It's a Mystery'' (''I 
liked it when you hurt me/Forget it, it's a mystery.'') </p>
<p>Her spirits are up again on the tropical, flute-supported ''Small Heads'' as 
she sings ''The world revolves around you/But it revolves around me, too,'' 
however, when she's told ''You're not my Yoko Ono'' on the 
Mideastern-flavored ''Lovesick,'' you'd think no one could have said 
anything more cruel. </p>
<p>Germano shakes out of her malaise by advising the disillusioned to ''learn to 
love yourself,'' yet her vulnerability returns to the surface on the piano-driven 
''Messages From Sophia'' as she begs ''Would you just carry my home?'' 
Then she appropriately closes the album with ''Big Big World'': ''Got a big, 
big heart/A big broken heart/In a big, big world.'' </p>
<p>Loaded with surreal music, Germano's sonic dreamscapes are sad and 
beautiful. They don't amount to a package as haunting as ''Geek the Girl,'' 
but that would be a nearly impossible achievement. </p>
<p>Rating (five possible): * * * * 1/2 </p>
<p>''Mr. Happy Go Lucky,'' John Mellencamp (Mercury) </p>
<p>Some John Mellencamp fans will be miffed at their hero's selection of 
dance-club mixer Junior Vasquez for the production of ''Mr. Happy Go 
Lucky,'' but the collaboration is a triumph. </p>
<p>Nothing is dramatically different -- Mellencamp is still working with the same 
band, and his sound is the same except for more pronounced, muscular 
rhythms. And with the integrity intact, the beefier beats merely add punch, 
urbanizing his traditional folk-rock. </p>
<p>The prolific Mellencamp has had some recent ups and downs (a new child, a 
heart attack) that have doubtless added insight to his reliably poignant 
observations. And it is that universal appeal that has always been key to his 
success. </p>
<p>Singing with his usual weathered charisma, a husky mix of philosophy and 
hedonism, Mellencamp picks his way through loneliness on the throbbing 
''Life Is Hard,'' embraces ''the full catastrophe of life'' on the rumbling ''The 
Full Catastrophe'' and shrugs off futility on the breezy ''Just Another Day.'' </p>
<p>Mellencamp sings disdainfully about a full-grown man who ''sees the world 
through a 10-year-old boy's eyes'' on the rollicking ''Jerry,'' and he assumes 
the creepy persona of ''Mr. Bellows.'' </p>
<p>The leadoff single, ''Key West Intermezzo,'' is an ingratiating romp about 
hanging out, but ''This May Not Be the End of the World'' is nothing but 
ominous as he offers a belated comment on the saga of PeeWee Herman: ''I 
guess you heard about ol' PeeWee/We had to tear his playhouse down/Then 
they put him in the electric chair/We'll have some fun now,'' he sings 
caustically. </p>
<p>Yet the most affecting song is the simplest one. ''Jackamo Road'' is a sweet 
acoustic-guitar ballad about a man signing off on life: ''I'm going to heaven/I'll 
come back to get you/Someday . . . someday . . . someday.'' </p>
<p>Again, the Vasquez touch might seem jarring, pushing the ''Mr. Happy Go 
Lucky'' songs into aggressive cadences. </p>
<p>The effect only invigorates the music, however. As Mellencamp himself says 
on ''Large World Turning,'' ''Nothing lasts forever/Thank God for change.'' </p>
<p>Rating: * * * * 1/2 </p>
<p>''Wildest Dreams,'' Tina Turner (Virgin) </p>
<p>Tina Turner is an enduring rock icon who's still a force 12 years after her 
improbable ''comeback'' album, ''Private Dancer.'' </p>
<p>Yet the native Tennessean is based in Europe now (with homes in 
Switzerland and France) because her following is substantially stronger 
overseas than in the United States. </p>
<p>Why the disparity? </p>
<p>For one thing, the same ageism/sexism that haunts actresses in the States 
also plagues women singers. And at 57, Turner is way beyond the comfort 
zone. </p>
<p>Also, Europeans have longer, more forgiving love affairs with their 
celebrities: Michael Jackson has persevered there, but in the trend-crazy 
United States, even Pearl Jam and Hootie &amp; The Blowfish are showing signs 
of fading. </p>
<p>More to America's credit, however, Tina Turner hasn't been turning out 
great music in the last decade. The hooks and originality just haven't been 
there, and as a result, her releases have been more suited to passive listening 
by fans (like the Europeans) who are willing to let her rest on her laurels. </p>
<p>''Wildest Dreams'' is an improvement, but not a solution to her doldrums. </p>
<p>Some of the more noteworthy songs are covers (so much for creativity) -- 
including the recent single ''Missing You,'' a feral turn on John Waite's hit, 
and Turner's earthy take on Massive Attack's fine ''Unfinished Symphony.'' </p>
<p>The singer's got an accomplished supporting cast on the album. Sting makes 
a cameo on the floating-synth heartbreaker ''On Silent Wings.'' The Pet 
Shop Boys wrote, produced and perform on the smoky ''Confidential.'' And 
U2's Bono and The Edge collaborated to write the very Bond-ish 
''Goldeneye,'' the title song from the recent 007 movie. </p>
<p>But will these talents help? Sting, the Pet Shop Boys and U2 haven't burned 
up the charts in a while. </p>
<p>Turner also sings the Sheryl Crow-penned anthem ''All Kinds of People,'' 
which boosts her cool quotient. But for the most part ''Wildest Dreams'' is a 
glossy, sometimes meditative/sometimes danceable rehash of '80s music. </p>
<p>The singer is planning a tour of the United States in May 1997, so she can 
gauge how ''Wildest Dreams'' fares in the meantime. </p>
<p>But right now she's in the midst of a triumphant tour of Europe, and she just 
took a lucrative role as the new spokesperson for Hanes pantyhose. </p>
<p>So if her album only gets a lukewarm reception here, don't expect Tina 
Turner to be crying in the Seine. </p>
<p>Rating: * * * </p>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>P</font>olly Jean Harvey </p>
<p>gets even grittier </p>
<p>''Dance Hall at Louse Point,'' John Parish and Polly Jean Harvey (Island) </p>
<p>Apparently Polly Jean Harvey feared she was getting too mainstream. </p>
<p>''Dance Hall at Louse Point'' turns her abrasion factor up a level when 
abrasion has always been her forte. </p>
<p>Not to diminish the contributions of John Parish (who wrote the music on 11 
tracks), but the enigmatic Harvey is the inescapable focal point of ''Dance 
Hall.'' </p>
<p>As chief engineer of the band PJ Harvey, she's been a riveting force in the 
'90s, releasing three incredible albums in a four-year span, each of which 
rated consideration for best record of the year -- ''Dry'' (1992), ''Rid of Me'' 
(1993) and ''To Bring You My Love'' (1995, co-produced by Parish). </p>
<p>She's invented a kind of modern-rock blues with a freewheeling command of 
music that blisters or subdues and vocals so raw with emotion they bleed. </p>
<p>Far too severe for general consumption, Harvey has nonetheless earned one 
of the most devoted followings of any contemporary act. </p>
<p>Now there's ''Dance Hall at Louse Point.'' </p>
<p>In some respects, it sounds like a PJ Harvey album -- music swinging from 
tranquilizing to unsettling as the tormented Harvey swerves in and out of 
psychosis (sometimes within the same song). </p>
<p>But Parish's instrumentation is usually limited to a few chords, whether it's 
the fiery repetition of ''City of No Sun,'' the hard minimalism of ''Un Cercle 
Autour du Soleil'' or the spare play on ''Rope Bridge Crossing'' and the 
instrumental opening, ''Girl.'' (The title track is a more compelling 
instrumental, as guitar and drum run parallel with twisting abandon.) </p>
<p>Harvey is the exclamation point on the songs, and she's puzzling as ever -- 
wandering drunkenly through ''Rope Bridge Crossing'' (''Now I'm treading 
very carefully/And I hope that I don't scream/And I hope that I don't fall''), 
searching to reclaim her innocence on ''That Was My Veil'' (''No words can 
heal my heart/Inside I'm broken'') and singing ''Jesus save me'' like an 
apparition on ''Taut'' before ripping into a whispered, rambling and 
disquieting tale. </p>
<p>After professing her belief in God on ''Lost Fun Zone,'' she adds ''I don't 
believe that I gotta die someday.'' Meanwhile, her repeated quest for 
redemption on the album is answered by a smooth-talking man on the 
crashing ''Heela.'' </p>
<p>However, the album veers into bracing austerity, and not of the commanding 
''Rid of Me'' sort: It's easy to relate to her screeches of ''I can't breathe!/I 
can't breathe!'' on the haywired performance-art bit ''City of No Sun,'' and 
''Urn With Dead Flowers in a Drained Pool'' keeps cycling through 
unlistenable rounds. </p>
<p>In a moment of true inspiration, Harvey and Parish deliver a more-or-less 
straightforward cover of Peggy Lee's classic ''Is That All There Is?'' They 
pay faithful homage to Lee with fitting matter-of-factness, yet the song is out 
of step with the rest of the album: It's too clearly defined and too 
well-rounded. </p>
<p>''Dance Hall at Louse Point'' is as challenging as anything Harvey has done, 
but meeting her challenge doesn't bring the usual rewards. </p>
<p>Rating (five possible): FOUR STARS </p>

<p><!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Dateline Here--> </p>
<p><font size=2><strong>Having fun isn't all Sheryl Crow wants to do.</strong></font> </p>
<p>''Sheryl Crow,'' Sheryl Crow (A&amp;M) </p>
<p>Sheryl Crow is a little more philosophical and a little less freewheeling on her 
self-produced, self-titled follow-up to ''Tuesday Night Music Club,'' which 
will doubtless help eradicate the mistaken notion she's as superficial as the 
chorus to her hit ''All I Wanna Do.'' </p>
<p>She's no Aristotle -- she's not even a Mellencamp -- but the singer has some 
astute observations to share, such as her existential bender on ''Everyday Is 
a Winding Road'' (''I've been living on coffee and nicotine/I've been 
wondering if all the things I've seen were even real.'') </p>
<p>Less introspective than ''Tuesday Night Music Club,'' ''Sheryl Crow'' is more 
outward in scope, another of those fly-on-the-wall views of 
Everyman/Everywoman that comes to no real conclusions. </p>
<p>There are a pair of loose-women profiles in ''Sweet Rosalyn'' and ''Oh 
Marie.'' Rosalyn's a woman who's just getting by and amusing herself with a 
wild streak, and Marie ''claims the guys are hard to please/She wears teen 
perfume behind her knees.'' (The singer divulges more than a passing interest 
in Marie.) </p>
<p>And Crow reveals she's a bit of a wench herself, singing torchily about 
leaving a man asleep in the nude on ''Ordinary Morning'' and confessing ''I'm 
not the kind of girl you'd take home'' on the gritty drinking song ''If It Makes 
You Happy.'' </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Crow has an ominous take on the world in general, mounting the 
pulpit on the country/gospel/folk ditty ''Redemption Day'' and giving up on 
the puzzle of humanity on ''Hard To Make a Stand'' (musically a close 
relative to the ''Tuesday Night Music Club'' track ''Can't Cry Anymore''). </p>
<p>Then there's the line from the jumping ''Love Is a Good Thing'' that got her 
banned from Wal-Mart: ''Watch our children while they kill each other/With 
a gun they bought at Wal-Mart discount stores.'' There's nothing enlightening 
about the line, but it rings true. </p>
<p>Actually, there's not much to learn from any of Crow's musings . . . except 
for her infrequent confessionals. The intimacy of ''Home'' stands out with 
beautifully textured understatement and Crow's soul-baring as she sings to 
her lover of 15 years, ''I woke up this morning/To the sound of breaking 
hearts/Mine is full of questions/And it's tearing yours apart.'' </p>
<p>And on the string-laced dirge ''The Book,'' she sings bitterly about betrayal: 
''You're a voyeur/The worst kind of thief.'' </p>
<p>Whatever her topic, Crow still churns out the winning hooks. Even 
throwaways such as ''Superstar'' are injected with life, and her band 
(particularly the multi-instrumentalist Jeff Trott) doesn't let her down during 
the genre-hopping journey across pop, country, rock and, occasionally, jazz 
and blues. </p>
<p>There aren't as many obvious singles as on ''Tuesday Night Music Club,'' 
which may not bode well for the album's longevity. But with a couple of 
good videos, Sheryl Crow will be back in business. </p>
<p>Rating (five possible): Four Stars </p>
<p>''Pinkerton,'' Weezer (DGC) </p>
<p>Weezer makes good on the promise of its 1994 self-titled debut with 
''Pinkerton,'' marrying infectious noise to Rivers Cuomo's consistently 
entertaining lyrics. </p>
<p>''Pinkerton'' is the singer/guitarist's love odyssey over a span of a couple of 
years, and it's rife with caustic frustration. </p>
<p>The Los Angeles-based band (whose members all hail from the East) also 
features Brian Bell on guitar, bassist Matt Sharp (who is leader of the 
retro-New Wave band The Rentals) and drummer Pat Wilson (another 
Rental). The outfit crunches insinuating melodies into a tight rock package as 
Bell and Sharp dovetail vocal harmonies into Cuomo's lead. </p>
<p>The contagious mystique that propelled ''Buddy Holly'' and the lovable 
eccentricity that marked ''Undone (The Sweater Song)'' two years ago find 
their way into ''Pinkerton.'' </p>
<p>Opening with the just-plain-weird dynamics of ''Tired of Sex,'' Cuomo faces 
one hurdle after another in his love life. So armed with a crisp, staccato 
chorus on ''Why Bother?'', he vows his commitment to being alone. </p>
<p>But he's a sucker. </p>
<p>He's beguiled by a fan letter from a distant 18-year-old on ''Across the Sea'': 
''I wonder what clothes you wear to school/I wonder how you decorate 
your room/I wonder how you touch yourself and curse myself for being 
across the sea.'' </p>
<p>Meanwhile, on ''Pink Triangle'' he falls for a lesbian, and after proclaiming 
that everyone is a little gay, he asks, ''Can't she be a little straight?'' </p>
<p>Despite his exhaustive bad luck, Cuomo endures a taunting guitar on the 
swaggering ''El Scorcho'' for a hilarious come-on filled with modern-rock 
in-references, and he slices through the thunderous overload of ''Falling for 
You'' to deliver what seems to be a genuine declaration of infatuation. </p>
<p>Of course love gets him nowhere. </p>
<p>Against the in-your-face grind of ''No Other One,'' he sums up a relationship 
with ''Nobody knows me like her/Nobody knows her like me/We're all 
we've got/And we don't wanna be alone.'' Not very romantic. </p>
<p>Weezer closes the album with the acoustic ''Butterfly,'' where a darkly 
sympathetic Cuomo sings, ''I told you I would return when the robin makes 
his nest/But I ain't never coming back/I'm sorry.'' </p>
<p>That's a downer ending for an album that exploits the dark side of love with 
such humor, but somehow it seemed inevitable. </p>
<p>Rating: Four Stars </p>
<p>''Omnipop,'' Sam Phillips (Virgin) </p>
<p>Although she's collecting a respectable following from both critics and 
adult-alternative music fans, Sam Phillips doesn't seem to have breakout 
potential. </p>
<p>Sam Phillips hasn't matched the sales she had in the '80s as contemporary 
Christian singer Leslie Phillips, but she's gaining steadily with each secular 
album (the first of which was 1988's ''The Indescribable Wow''). So it's 
logical to expect her new ''Omnipop'' to outsell the 100,000 copies moved 
by 1994's ''Martinis &amp; Bikinis.'' </p>
<p>Given the album's deficiencies, however, it isn't likely to be vying for No. 1. </p>
<p>Produced by Phillips' husband, T Bone Burnett, ''Omnipop'' is a quirky 
sideshow with the singer flitting from one notion to the next. </p>
<p>The whimsical single ''Zero Zero Zero'' -- an ode to a valueless number -- 
swings by as trumpets, maracas, bongos and a steel guitar conspire for an 
adventurous dance-friendly sound. Likewise, the clomping ''Entertainment,'' 
a foreboding song about women who need attention, has lasting impact. </p>
<p>But most tracks don't resonate. </p>
<p>For example, ''Plastic Is Forever'' is a fun New Wave throwback with fun 
lyrics (''Diamond rings are for suburbs/Gold is too much trouble to be fun''), 
yet it loses charm on repeated listenings. And the collaboration with R.E.M., 
''Slapstick Heart,'' is lyrically provocative (''You cried an ocean and broke 
my fall/That's when I knew I couldn't swim at all''), the harmonium-backed 
instrumentation doesn't gel. </p>
<p>Also, Phillips' nasal twang is not particularly attractive, which might be the 
reason her character was mute in the movie ''Die Hard With a Vengeance'' 
(she played the sidekick to Jeremy Irons' villain). Her part was small, and it 
probably made only a minor impression with the general audience. </p>
<p>Phillips' role in music is a similar one. </p>
<p>Rating: 2 1/2 Stars </p>

<p>-- AENIMA, Tool (Zoo) </p>
<p>Though critics and fans have tried, it's ridiculous to try to elevate Tool to an 
intellectual phenomenon when the Los Angeles-based group is merely a 
natural progression in the evolution of heavy metal. </p>
<p>That's what happens when adults indulge in mindless pleasures and want to 
feel better about themselves by justifying their instincts. But Tool lovers 
should simply accept their primal urges and go with them. </p>
<p>Tool -- which features singer Maynard James Keenan, guitarist Adam 
Jones, drummer Danny Carey and new bass player Justin Chancellor (who 
replaces Paul D'Amour) -- built a considerable cult following with its 
full-length debut, 1993's ''Undertow.'' </p>
<p>After prolonged anticipation, the follow-up arrives three years later. And 
Tool delivers the inevitable apocalyptic overload in ''Aenima.'' </p>
<p>About all that separates Tool from old-fashioned heavy metal is a singer who 
really sings and interesting segues that break from the bulldozing music. </p>
<p>Among these segues, ''Cesaro Summability'' echoes with baby screams, 
''(--) Ions'' is a study in horror effects, ''Intermission'' is a cheesy, cheery 
instrumental ditty, and ''Message to Harry Manback'' is an enigmatic 
piano-and-seagull piece with a bitter, yet subdued, dialogue. </p>
<p>But those are diversions: ''Aenima'' centers on the grim (though melodic) 
bellows of Keenan and the driving doom of over-the-top guitars and bass. 
The showcase tracks are exhaustive epics that shift from one cheerless 
nuance to the next. And whether the initial tone stalks (on ''Stinkfist''), clinks 
(on ''Eulogy'') or buzzes (''Pushit''), the songs eventually escalate into a 
similar big-noise overkill. </p>
<p>It's during those reverb-laced explosions of fascinating fury that Tool sounds 
so much like its predecessors, even if the band found more imaginative ways 
to get there. And at least the frightening ''Die Eier Von Satan'' maintains an 
edge for its full duration as an irregular chugging grind underlies a controlled 
German vocal that grows into an ever-hysterical, intimidating rant. </p>
<p>Incidentally, ''Aenima'' pays homage to the late comedian Bill Hicks, whose 
dark diatribes hid cerebral truths under their abrasive surfaces. </p>
<p>As to those who want to believe Tool is likewise profound, they should stop 
kidding themselves and just enjoy the ride. </p>
<p>Rating (five possible): XXX 1/2 </p>
<p>-- FROM THE MUDDY BANKS OF THE WISHKAH, Nirvana (DGC) </p>
<p>Nirvana was a great band. </p>
<p>Kurt Cobain has been dead for two and a half years, however, and the 
grunge sound his group pioneered is now passe. Seattle bands have had to 
redefine themselves to survive. </p>
<p>So as time goes by, Cobain's suicide doesn't seem so monumental. And 
that's just natural: Rock music has a knack for absorbing tragic deaths 
without falling apart. </p>
<p>''From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah'' is a reminder of how good 
Nirvana was, but Cobain doesn't emerge as a genius worthy of deification. </p>
<p>The album is a collection of live recordings culled from performances from 
1989 to 1994. With cheering crowds fusing the songs together, ''From the 
Muddy Banks of the Wishkah'' deceptively sounds like one outstanding 
concert, though varying levels of sharpness and inspiration give it away as a 
cut-and-splice affair. </p>
<p>The album is highlighted by powerful renditions of ''Aneurysm'' and ''Smells 
Like Teen Spirit'' from a 1991 California show and an electrifying ''Scentless 
Apprentice'' from a 1993 Seattle concert. Still, despite Nirvana's excellence, 
''From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah'' is a pretty typical live album. And 
bass player Krist Novoselic's dry chronology of the group (printed in the 
insert) adds no insight. </p>
<p>As long as there's a market for it, DGC Records is apt to keep assembling 
live Nirvana albums from the group's years of performing. But hangers-on 
would do well to be content with Cobain's place in rock history and throw 
their support to talented performers who've had the courage to keep living. </p>
<p>Rating: XXXX </p>
<p>-- ''SET IT OFF'' SOUNDTRACK, various acts (Elektra) </p>
<p>The soundtrack for ''Set It Off'' is a potpourri of songs that reaches out to 
several demographics. Both big names and unknowns are represented; some 
are successful, and some fail. </p>
<p>In other words, it's a conventional soundtrack. </p>
<p>The movie, which is something of a ''Waiting To Exhale '' meets ''Thelma &amp; 
Louise,'' stars Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah, Vivica Fox and Kimberly Elise 
and is slated to open Nov. 6. </p>
<p>The soundtrack's urban blend of music is appropriate considering the young 
actresses play women from the projects of Los Angeles. And Queen Latifah 
shows up on two tracks -- performing with Organized Noize on the springy 
R&amp;B/rap/funk title theme and rapping through the trashy lyrics and cheesy 
sound of ''Name Callin'.'' </p>
<p>Her uneven efforts mirror the album. </p>
<p>En Vogue resurfaces in the music world to deliver a soulful knockout in 
''Don't Let Go (Love),'' but Seal wanders in with out-of-place electric 
guitars and a decidedly uncatchy ''Hey Joe.'' Blulight's ''Sex Is on My Mind'' 
reverberates with sensuality, but Simply Red's ''Angel'' flutters by sluggishly. </p>
<p>''Missing You'' features Brandy, Tamia, Gladys Knight and Chaka Khan 
singing about sisterhood -- and it would be dynamite if it weren't so effusive. 
Meanwhile, Brandy's brother Ray J. makes a solid contribution in ''Let It 
Go.'' </p>
<p>The album is rounded out by unnoteworthy rap tracks -- including Bone 
Thugs-N-Harmony's ''Tha Crossroads''-like ''Days of Our Livez.'' </p>
<p>It may produce a few killer singles, but this soundtrack isn't consistent 
enough to rate huge success. </p>
<p>Rating: XX 1/2 </p>

        one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five being the
        highest: </p>
        <p>-- ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR, Marilyn Manson
        (Nothing/Interscope) </p>
        <p>The group Marilyn Manson probably wants to share more
        than just a record label with Nine Inch Nails, and at its best,
        the band DOES seem like Son of NIN. </p>
        <p>More often, Marilyn Manson is just an updated Alice
        Cooper. </p>
        <p>The band of transvestites has such clever names as
        Madonna Wayne Gacy and Twiggy Ramirez (and Marilyn
        Manson, of course), but the image is more creative than
        the sound. </p>
        <p>''Antichrist Superstar'' is an ersatz hard-rock
        musical (though not the spoof of ''Jesus Christ
        Superstar'' the name implies), held together with
        redundant images of rock stars, worms and angels. There's
        not much discernible plot, and the overriding message is
        simply that the world is a horrible place. </p>
        <p>Even relentless heavy-handed misery can be artistic,
        as NIN's Trent Reznor proves, yet Marilyn Manson doesn't
        develop its negativity beyond the constant echoing of a
        few evocative notions. Considering the demographics of
        the group's largely adolescent following, however, most
        Marilyn Manson fans won't object to the band's crutch of
        repetition. </p>
        <p>The blatant exploitation of teen angst stays on the
        surface virtually the entire album with lyrics such as
        ''I wasn't born with enough middle fingers . . . You never,
        ever believed in me . . . Everyone will suffer now . . .
        The time has come for bitter things . . . I'm on my way
        down now . . . You can kill yourself now because you're
        dead in my mind.'' </p>
        <p>Then there's the album-closing mantra, ''When all of
        your wishes are granted, many of your dreams will be
        destroyed.'' </p>
        <p>Marilyn Manson makes such a dramatic presentation it's
        hard not to be swept in, particularly by the rousing
        anthemic title track, but also by the wailing guitars of
        ''Tourniquet,'' the fury of ''1996'' and a lower-key cartoonish
        nightmare, ''Cryptorchid.'' </p>
        <p>Even many of the more mundane tracks (and there are a
        truckload of them) are moderately engaging despite their
        familiarity. </p>
        <p>Marilyn Manson can't possibly be taken seriously, but
        the group 's over-the-top theatrics would spark the envy
        of Ozzy Osbourne. And for a little while, the absurdity
        of ''Antichrist Superstar'' is overshadowed by its flair. </p>
        <p>Rating (five possible): XXX </p>
        <p>-- YOUR SECRET LOVE, Luther Vandross (Epic/LV Records) </p>
        <p>It doesn't get more predictable than ''Your Secret
        Love.'' </p>
        <p>R&amp;B mainstay Luther Vandross puts his
        extraordinary voice to ordinary use on his stale new
        album, trotting it through adult contemporary cliches without
        giving it soul. </p>
        <p>Even the most trite lyrics and calculated production
        will sound almost decent with the silky voiced Vandross
        at the mike, but this schlocky album is no better than
        ''almost decent.'' </p>
        <p>All songs are about relationships, of course -- some
        of them improbable little stories made even more
        insincere by antiseptic production. (For example, the
        lightweight arrangement of ''Love Don't Love You
        Anymore'' doesn't match the depressing mood of the
        lyrics.) </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, most songs are blatantly manipulative --
        including the synthetically blissful ''It's Hard for Me
        To Say,'' the string-laden ''Crazy Love'' and the
        singer's gooey duet with Lisa Fischer, ''Whether or Not
        the World Gets Better'' (which could be both a wedding
        song wannabe and a reject ballad from a Disney animated
        movie). </p>
        <p>''Your Secret Love'' is innocuous enough, and Vandross
        is a sport, lifting the title track and a serviceable
        remake of ''Goin' out of My Head'' out of the
        insubstantial muck. </p>
        <p>But the material wasn't really worth saving. </p>
        <p>Plus the singer is hampered by overwhelming backing
        vocalists who relentlessly squawk away in exclamation
        points, supplying an aggravating pseudo-emotion to
        compensate for the general disconnectedness of Vandross. </p>
        <p>It's hard to believe such a talented singer could
        listen to this album and think it's good enough for
        public consumption. </p>
        <p>But here it is. </p>
        <p>Rating: XX </p>
        <p>-- IN FLIGHT, Linda Perry (Interscope) </p>
        <p>Hardly any singer would even think of leaving a band
        right after the group triumphed with its debut album, but
        Linda Perry shrugged off the promise of 4 Non Blondes'
        multi-platinum ''Bigger, Faster, Better, More'' (powered
        by the Top 10 single ''What's Up'') and went solo with
        ''In Flight.'' </p>
        <p>Her instincts were right. </p>
        <p>''In Flight'' is a spellbinding collection of mostly
        seamless songs inspired by Pink Floyd's ''Dark Side of
        the Moon.'' Spacious, understated and steeped in
        atmosphere, ''In Flight'' would be a source of calm
        reflection if not for the charged vocals of Perry. </p>
        <p>She lifts the brooding mix into a dynamic exploration
        of frustration and doom. </p>
        <p>Demonstrating her empathic power on ''Fill Me Up,''
        Perry adopts the stupor of an alcoholic trying to
        reconstruct events in her life (''Was I sleazy/Or was I
        dazzling/And did I even say goodbye?'') and glumly looks at
        her hazy future (''I grow weary from this trip I'm on/And
        the ride keeps getting longer''). </p>
        <p>Perry and Bill Bottrell play guitars -- which range
        from acoustic folk to electric blues -- the late Kevin
        Gilbert plays keyboards, Dan Schwartz plays bass and
        steel guitar, and Lisa Germano contributes violin. </p>
        <p>Also, Grace Slick sings a duet with Perry on ''Knock
        Me Out,'' an expansive blues track that is an ambiguous
        love song between two women: ''You knocked me out/You bit
        my lip/You held me down and kept me sober.'' The flipside
        is the beguiling tenderness of ''Taken,'' a nebulous illusion
        with contradictions of its own. </p>
        <p>There's an intoxicating Mazzy Star-ish feel to
        ''Success'' as Perry contemplates triumph (''Will success
        fail me?/Will it make me free?''), and an air-raid siren
        effect enhances the singer's tension on ''Freeway.'' </p>
        <p>The stark mood that predominates makes for fetching
        continuity, not monotony -- although with ''Too Deep''
        and ''Machine Man,'' the album takes on the uncomfortable
        feel of a rock musical. But ''Fruitloop Daydream'' is a
        diversion from the tone, a carnival walk in a
        drug-infested park, which Perry delivers with sly appeal. </p>
        <p>But the singer glides back into the ponderous mode at
        album's end, sailing off into the ether with the title
        track. </p>
        <p>Listeners will likewise drift away. </p>
        <p>Rating: XXXX 1/2 </p>

<P>     -- NO TALKING JUST HEAD, The Heads (MCA/Radioactive)
<P>     The Heads make a concept work on &#39;&#39;No Talking Just Head&#39;&#39;: A revolving door of guest vocalists give variety while a stationary band gives continuity.
<P>     Unlike compilation albums, which are almost always inconsistent, &#39;&#39;No Talking Just Head&#39;&#39; is well-anchored by one of the keenest rhythm sections in popular music. With Tina Weymouth on bass guitar, Jerry Harrison on keyboards and Chris Frantz providing beats, the Heads are a reunion of three-fourths of the Talking Heads. And their method of substitution for David Byrne with a dozen vocalists is rather ingenious. (Blast Murray joins The Heads as guitarist.)
<P>     Those former Talking Heads have extensive credits beyond that bellwether band. Weymouth and Frantz founded the extraordinary Tom Tom Club, and Harrison forged a successful solo career. Plus the three have all been occupied by producing other bands -- Harrison working with Live, Crash Test Dummies and the Violent Femmes among others and Weymouth/Frantz working with Ziggy Marley, Happy Mondays and more.
<P>     Drawing on decades of varied and triumphant experience, The Heads lay an engagingly diverse musical foundation for &#39;&#39;No Talking Just Head.&#39;&#39; But the vocalists are more than decorations; they bring with them their own lyrics and personalities:
<P>     Concrete Blonde&#39;s Johnette Napolitano (who has become lead vocalist for The Heads in time for its tour) is suitably apocalyptic against the foreboding mood of &#39;&#39;Damage I&#39;ve Done.&#39;&#39; Debbie Harry reprises her more aggressive early Blondie days for the crashing title track. Maria McKee dovetails into a heady rhythmic rush on the dance-oriented &#39;&#39;No Big Bang.&#39;&#39; Gavin Friday&#39;s sensual rasp glides along the enticing exotica of &#39;&#39;Blue Blue Moon.&#39;&#39; Spoken-word performer Malin Annetag delivers an amusing deadpan against the humming cosmic whim of &#39;&#39;No More Lonely Nights.&#39;&#39; Richard Hell stalks along the predatory groove of &#39;&#39;Never Mind.&#39;&#39; Andy Partridge of XTC taps into the grinding insinuation of &#39;&#39;Papersnow&#39;&#39; . . .
<P>     There&#39;s also a Tom Tom Club flashback on the playful &#39;&#39;Punk Lolita&#39;&#39; (which features Weymouth, Napolitano and Harry on vocals) and some solo-Harrison deja vu on the bruising &#39;&#39;Don&#39;t Take My Kindness for Weakness&#39;&#39; (featuring Shaun Ryder of Black Grapes).
<P>     The album is finished off by lesser tracks featuring Michael Hutchence of INXS (&#39;&#39;The King Is Gone&#39;&#39;), Ed Kowalczyk of Live (&#39;&#39;Indie Hair&#39;&#39;) and Gordon Gano of Violent Femmes (&#39;&#39;Only the Lonely&#39;&#39;).
<P>     Despite these uninspired cuts, David Byrne isn&#39;t missed.
<P>     Rating (five possible): XXXX

<P>     -- RAP&#39;S NEW GENERATION, Wreckx-N-Effect (MCA)
<P>     The two members of Wreckx-N-Effect have decided to forgo making another &#39;&#39;Rump Shaker&#39;&#39; in order to be Angry Black Men.
<P>     Harlem rappers Aqil &#39;&#39;A-Plus&#39;&#39; Davidson and Markell &#39;&#39;Miggidy Mark&#39;&#39; Riley pay tribute in a roundabout way to 14 hip-hop songs with dramatically revised versions (that ironically sound very much like each other) on &#39;&#39;Rap&#39;s New Generation.&#39;&#39;
<P>     They take the original songs -- such as KRS-One&#39;s &#39;&#39;Criminal Minded,&#39;&#39; LL Cool J&#39;s &#39;&#39;Boomin System&#39;&#39; and Biz Markie&#39;s &#39;&#39;Da Vapors&#39;&#39; -- and turn them into something unrecognizable, minimal music/maximum rap tracks brimming with obscenities.
<P>     Perhaps &#39;&#39;tribute&#39;&#39; is the wrong word.
<P>     And on &#39;&#39;Top Billin&#39;&#39; there&#39;s a special slap at fans of the Wreckx-N-Effect smash &#39;&#39;Rump Shaker&#39;&#39; who might be looking for something similar to that raucous hit: A-Plus and Miggidy Mark have moved on, and so should you.
<P>     The duo have progressed (degenerated?) to a ticked-off, relentless sound crammed full of breathless rapping underscored by bare (but bottom-heavy) instrumentation. A few lodge themselves into the subconscious -- including &#39;&#39;Planet Rock&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Funk Box&#39;&#39; -- but most of &#39;&#39;Rap&#39;s New Generation&#39;&#39; has an anesthetic effect.
<P>     Oddly enough, on an album overflowing with credits to outsiders, Wreckx-N-Effect fail to acknowledge their &#39;&#39;borrowing&#39;&#39; from the theme song of the cult horror flick &#39;&#39;Phantasm&#39;&#39; on the twosome&#39;s most effective track, &#39;&#39;Intro: New Generation.&#39;&#39;
<P>     Maybe they were so mad they forgot.

<P>     -- SUSANNA HOFFS, Susanna Hoffs (London)
<P>     Susanna Hoffs is one of many egotistical singers who foolishly brought down a successful band -- in her case, the Bangles -- to venture out as a soloist, ruining everyone&#39;s careers in the process.
<P>     Five years after her forgettable solo debut, &#39;&#39;When You&#39;re a Boy,&#39;&#39; Hoffs is trying again with &#39;&#39;Susanna Hoffs,&#39;&#39; and the best that can be said about it is that it is NOT a straightforward adult contemporary album (the ultimate sellout).
<P>     In fact, Hoffs recruited supporting artists with cutting-edge credentials (Matthew Sweet, members of Sparklehorse, Cracker and That Dog, and Linda Perry of 4 Non Blondes) as well as Mick Fleetwood and former Go-Go&#39;s member Charlotte Caffey. 
<P>     That said, &#39;&#39;Susanna Hoffs&#39;&#39; is no more a modern-rock album than it is an adult contemporary album.
<P>     It&#39;s just a simple pop recording -- and not a very catchy one. &#39;&#39;Susanna Hoffs&#39;&#39; is mostly bland and predominately mopey as the singer plays a love victim/beggar.
<P>     A few oddities serve as diversions: &#39;&#39;Enormous Wings&#39;&#39; is a perplexing song based on a short story by Gabriel Garcia Marquez; &#39;&#39;King of Tragedy,&#39;&#39; a mid-album jump-start, portrays the other woman as &#39;&#39;a cross between Emma Peel, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kathie Lee&#39;&#39;; and a pair of uncredited covers, &#39;&#39;To Sir With Love&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Stuck in the Middle With You,&#39;&#39; are adequate, though they underscore how weak the songwriting is elsewhere.
<P>     Among the nondescript tracks are &#39;&#39;Happy Place,&#39;&#39; where Hoffs is feeling blue but not articulate, the mistitled &#39;&#39;Grand Adventure&#39;&#39; (she&#39;s a lonely gal blithely hooked up with a &#39;&#39;great pretender&#39;&#39;) and the love-at-first-sight testimonial &#39;&#39;Eyes of a Baby.&#39;&#39;
<P>     Even the best of the original tracks, &#39;&#39;Beekeeper&#39;s Blues,&#39;&#39; is aggravating in its defeatism: &#39;&#39;I reeled you in, and you ate me half alive . . . No beekeeper goes unstung . . . I&#39;m walking back to you/What else can I do?&#39;&#39;
<P>     If ears could blink, &#39;&#39;Susanna Hoffs&#39;&#39; would be easy to miss.

        music critic </em></font></p>
        <p>The rating is done on a basis of one (X) to five
        (XXXXX) stars, with five being the highest: </p>
        <p>-- HOT SAKI &amp; BEDTIME STORIES, Catherine (TVT) </p>
        <p>Catherine's ''Hot Saki &amp; Bedtime Stories'' is one
        of the most rewarding slices of modern rock from the
        heartland since the Breeders' ''Last Splash.'' </p>
        <p>Brimming with instantly gratifying songs as well as
        tracks that subtly burrow into the subconscious, the
        Chicago band's third release is a showcase of luminescent
        melodies, robust guitars and galvanizing rhythms -- great
        stuff for driving, partying, cleaning house or just
        sitting around. </p>
        <p>''When the truth is on the run/Cause you lie to
        yourself and everyone . . . you better have fun'' urges
        singer/guitarist Mark Rew on the contagiously plucky
        ''It's Gonna Get Worse.'' Rew's solution of casting aside
        life's miseries to have a good time is a recurring theme
        on ''Hot Saki &amp; Bedtime Stories.'' </p>
        <p>Braced against the friction of chugging guitars on
        ''Vegas Glam,'' the carefree vocalist proclaims ''I'm not
        gonna stop until I've lost everything.'' Also, on the
        spunky ''Don't Touch Me There'' he counters the title
        refrain with ''Let me under your sweater,'' and on the
        sporty ''Four Leaf Clover'' he swaps jabs with guest
        vocalist D'Arcy Brown of Smashing Pumpkins. </p>
        <p>Brown's connection to Catherine isn't incidental --
        her husband Kerry is the group's drummer, and his brother
        Keith is its bass player. Plus ''Hot Saki &amp; Bedtime
        Stories'' was recorded at a studio on D'Arcy and Kerry's
        apple farm in Southern Michigan. (D'Arcy also chips in
        backing vocals on the forlorn ''Punch Me Out.'') </p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the D'Arcy Brown factor, comparisons
        of Catherine to Smashing Pumpkins are inevitable because
        both carefully balance sweet harmonies and high-voltage
        guitars. But Catherine is a looser, better natured outfit. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Rew -- who takes over as sole lead
        vocalist with the departure of singer/guitarist Neil
        Jendon -- is a fairly weak singer (not that Breeder Kim
        Deal will win singing awards for anything but charisma),
        and some of Catherine's more disconnected songs
        (''Blacklight,'' ''Pink Floyd Poster,'' ''Good Luck
        Charm'') linger too long in blissful serenity. </p>
        <p>Still, ''Hot Saki &amp; Bedtime Stories'' is a good
        bet anytime of the day. </p>
        <p>Rating (five possible): XXXX </p>
        <p>-- THE GARDEN, Merril Bainbridge (Universal) </p>
        <p>Merril Bainbridge's ''The Garden'' makes a good case
        for CD singles. </p>
        <p>Those inspired to buy the Australian singer's debut
        album thanks to her hit single ''Mouth'' are in for a
        disappointment because nothing else on ''The Garden''
        sounds remotely like ''Mouth.'' </p>
        <p>To her credit, Bainbridge has delivered a hit truly
        unique to contemporary airwaves: With a grunting and
        percolating rhythm loop prodding her along, she sings
        with a crystalline voice reminiscent of wholesome '70s
        pop - though she coyly hints at naughtiness with lines
        such as ''Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
        Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?'' </p>
        <p>Goaded by the single, many won't resist the temptation
        of ''The Garden.'' But their reward is an album of songs
        not from the same planet as ''Mouth.'' With only a couple
        of exceptions, they aren't even in the same solar system. </p>
        <p>''Sleeping Dogs'' and ''Reasons Why'' are the distant
        relatives, the former a careening splash of retro-pop and
        the latter a bouncy, electric pop/rock ditty. </p>
        <p>Otherwise, ''The Garden'' is a light folk/New Age
        composite that is alternately perky and gloomy,
        perceptive and goofy. It isn't all that bad - there's
        even a trace of Enigma in the grandiose ''State of Mind''
        - it just isn't all that good, either. </p>
        <p>A more representative single from the album would have
        been Bainbridge's acoustic cover of Pet Shop Boys'
        ''Being Boring.'' Sweet enough to make your teeth hurt,
        its effect is similar to that of the airy cover of New
        Order's ''Bizarre Love Triangle'' by the band Frente
        (another Australian outfit). </p>
        <p>Perhaps the hit potential of ''Being Boring'' isn't as
        strong as that of ''Mouth,'' but it would have been a
        fairer way to introduce Bainbridge to the world. </p>
        <p>Rating: XX 1/2 </p>
        <p>-- ''IN DEFENSE OF ANIMALS VOLUME 2,'' various acts
        (Caroline) </p>
        <p>Hunters, zookeepers, leather-lovers, fur-wearers,
        bullriders and meat-eaters who happen to be modern-rock
        aficionados may face a quandry, depending on how strongly
        they feel about giving money to a cause they don't
        support in exchange for something cool. </p>
        <p>The animal-rights group In Defense of Animals already
        tempted them in 1993 with a compilation album featuring
        such luminaries as Pearl Jam, Michael Stipe and Primus. </p>
        <p>Well, the new ''In Defense of Animals Volume 2'' is
        even more impressive. </p>
        <p>Although some of the songs in the collection are
        readily available on albums -- including Bjork's
        hypnotically grinding ''Enjoy'' and PJ Harvey's
        unsettling ''Me-Jane'' -- most tracks are new mixes, rare
        B-sides or songs that are simply unavailable elsewhere. </p>
        <p>Elastica's fractured, spunky ''Brighton Rock'' and
        Ruby's cacophonous reconstruction of ''Tiny Meat,'' for
        example, are B-sides from U.K. singles. Meanwhile, White
        Zombie's explosive dance-rock mix of ''Electric Head Pt.
        2,'' Moby's hard-driving, vitriolic version of ''Let's Go
        Free (Live 95)'' and The Orb's humming mix of ''Slug
        Dub'' are all exclusive versions of available material. </p>
        <p>Altogether new songs include the industrial-edged ''We
        Done It Again'' by Meat Beat Manifesto, the brooding
        ''Spaceman'' by Belly and the effects-laden ''Cosmic
        Dub'' by Massive Attack v Mad Professor. </p>
        <p>The album is rounded out by tracks from Chemical
        Beats, Beastie Boys, KRS-One, Mike Watt, Alice Donut,
        Morphine and Aleka's Attic (featuring the late River
        Phoenix). </p>
        <p>''In Defense of Animals Volume 2'' is mostly
        dance-oriented and occasionally droning -- the kind of
        music that prompts mindless surrender. But there are
        twisted elements of folk, jazz and pop sprinkled
        throughout. </p>
        <p>Proceeds go to In Defense of Animals (which shouldn't
        be confused with PETA), and the CD insert includes a
        statement of purpose, quotes and suggestions for a more
        compassionate world. </p>
        <p>Some modern-rock fans may balk, but this album is
        undoubtedly better than anything hunting freak Ted Nugent
        could come up with. </p>
        <p>Rating: XXXX </p>

        <h3>''Karen Carpenter,'' Karen Carpenter (A&amp;M)</h3>
        <p><a href="images/1122chuck.jpg"><img
        src="../../../112196/images/1122chuck.jpg" align="right"
        border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="150" height="150"></a>Karen
        Carpenter shelved her self-titled solo debut in 1980, and
        the album's flaws are only magnified by the years that
        have passed. </p>
        <p>Nonetheless, A&amp;M's move to finally release ''Karen
        Carpenter'' as originally recorded was a sound decision
        because it fills in some blanks in the history of one of
        America's most beloved singers. </p>
        <p>The Carpenters - featuring Karen and her brother,
        Richard - have sold more than 90 million records
        worldwide. And more than a few of their fans have
        wondered about her unreleased solo album as Carpenter
        mania has remained strong, boosted partly by the 1994
        tribute album by modern-rock acts, ''If I Were a
        Carpenter.'' </p>
        <p>Carpenter died in 1983 from complications from
        anorexia nervosa when she was 32. Afterward, remixed
        versions of six songs from ''Karen Carpenter'' found
        their way onto a pair of Carpenters albums, ''Lovelines'' and
        ''From the Top.'' </p>
        <p>But the new release is how ''Karen Carpenter'' was
        intended. </p>
        <p>It's no great shakes, obviously; otherwise it would
        have been released long ago by Carpenter herself. Still,
        the singer's most endearing qualities waft out from the
        new/old album - her rich voice, her sense of melody, her
        charming lyrics. </p>
        <p>Had it been released in 1980, ''Karen Carpenter''
        might have done rather well, although its sexier, jazzier
        vibe could have been a distraction to longtime Carpenters
        fans. </p>
        <p>Some of the tracks sound hopelessly dated in 1996,
        however: ''Lovelines'' and ''My Body Keeps Changing My
        Mind'' are namby-pamby disco; ''Guess I Just Lost My
        Head'' is passe mid-tempo schlock; and ''Still in Love
        With You'' is an ill-conceived, cheesy mess. </p>
        <p>''Karen Carpenter'' is redeemed by the unexpected soul
        of the simple ''All Because of You,'' the discreet jazz
        of ''If We Try'' and the buoyant contagion of ''Making
        Love in the Afternoon.'' </p>
        <p>Songs this light are almost unheard of these days, but
        Carpenter compensates with her trademark glow, which
        underscores and saves ''If I Had You,'' ''Remember When
        Lovin' Took All Night,'' ''Make Believe It's Your First
        Time'' and a cover of ''Still Crazy After All These
        Years.'' </p>
        <p>''Karen Carpenter'' closes provocatively with the
        undemanding blues of ''Last One Singin' the Blues,'' with
        Carpenter sweetly singing ''I don't really wanna be the
        last one singin' the blues'' just before the album ends. </p>
        <p>That leaves a sad chill in the air, which is ironic,
        considering the warmth the singer brought to millions. </p>
        <p>Rating (five possible): 3 </p>
        <p>''Nico,'' Blind Melon (Capitol) </p>
        <p>Not to disrespect the dead, but if it hadn't been for
        that ''bumblebee girl'' in the ''No Rain'' video, Blind
        Melon probably wouldn't even have been a one-hit wonder. </p>
        <p>The group's debut album did well with fuel from ''No
        Rain,'' but its 1995 sophomore release (''Soup'') was a
        disaster. Then followed the tragic drug-death loss of
        lead singer Shannon Hoon. </p>
        <p>And now there's a post-mortem third release, ''Nico''
        -- scraped up bits of Blind Melon recordings from a
        ballroom, a hotel room, an answering machine. Such a
        gathering process is more industrious than merely collecting
        live cuts from concerts, but the material is weak. </p>
        <p>Blind Melon was thin on talent, and Hoon was hardly
        the captivating presence that could have made a
        difference: His delivery was comically nasal and whiny. </p>
        <p>Still, there's an eerie quality to ''Nico's'' dirgeful
        ''Ripped Away Version'' of ''No Rain,'' and Hoon's ragged
        take on Hoyt Axton's ''The Pusher'' is awash in sad
        irony. </p>
        <p>Other than the fatalistic tone of the album, there's
        not much else going on. Hoon's messy screech simply rips
        through the poorly developed music -- from the uncooked
        cover of John Lennon's ''John Sinclair'' to the bombast of
        the rumbling ''Glitch.'' </p>
        <p>''Nico'' comes to an unmerciful end with ''Letters
        From a Porcupine,'' an answering-machine message/song
        from Hoon to guitarist Christopher Thorn. The track is
        just awful in every respect. </p>
        <p>What a pitiful legacy for Blind Melon. </p>
        <p>Rating: 1 1/2 </p>
        <p>''Drive,'' The Spirits (Rocket/Island) </p>
        <p>The Spirits suffer from an understandable identity
        crisis on ''Drive.'' </p>
        <p>Fronted by studio musician Ronni O'Keefe and mostly
        unknown dance-music singer Nicky Williams, The Spirits
        have a pair of chameleons at the helm. </p>
        <p>Songwriter/bass player/producer O'Keefe has made a
        career of adapting to others musicians, as has Williams.
        And it seems their backgrounds have resulted in
        directionless as the band sounds alternately like
        Concrete Blonde, Tribe, the Cranberries, Everything But
        the Girl and Roxette. </p>
        <p>The Liverpool pair could do much worse than that, and
        their diversity reflects a fair amount of talent. </p>
        <p>O'Keefe spreads a spacious foundation for some songs,
        filling the aural labyrinth with enchanting rhythms and
        electric punctuations on the title track, ''Hope'' and
        ''I Fall.'' By contrast, there's a pressing urgency in
        the geared-up ''Truth Teller'' (though it sounds like a
        Roxette castoff) and a rousing electricity in ''Roar.'' </p>
        <p>Other cuts bounce between shimmering pop (''The
        Evening Song'') and pluckiness (''Save Me'') and
        somnambulism (''What's Going On'') -- a range that is
        both impressive and incongruent. </p>
        <p>Williams follows suit, and it's a bit hard to believe
        she's even the same singer from track to track. She
        belts, she seduces, she coos, she hypnotizes, she growls
        . . . but her personality and voice fly in so many directions,
        it's impossible to get a grip on who she is. </p>
        <p>O'Keefe's lyrics don't give much clue. He takes a
        couple of uncertain journeys into religion; he grinds
        axes over bad relationships; he dabbles in light
        philosophy. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile listeners are kept waiting for an ultimate
        ''Spirits'' sound that never emerges, something that
        would give the band definition. </p>
        <p>Yet for a scattershot album that fails to reach an
        epiphany, ''Drive'' is rather enjoyable. </p>
        <p>Rating: 3 1/2 </p>

        <h3>''EVITA'' SOUNDTRACK, cast (Warner Bros.)</h3>
        <p><a href="images/evita.jpg"><img
        src="images/evita.jpg" alt="Evita" align="right"
        border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="204" height="201"></a>Triumph,
        failure or something in between, Madonna is finally
        finished with her most ambitious undertaking to date, and
        the singer can move on to enjoy motherhood (and perhaps eventually
        cut a new album). </p>
        <p>''Evita,'' the upcoming movie adaptation of the Andrew
        Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice musical, stars Madonna as Eva
        Peron, and the soundtrack is making the rounds in advance
        of the release. </p>
        <p>Of all the questions haunting this project, the chief
        one has been, ''Can Madonna pull it off?'' </p>
        <p>She certainly tried. Though not a natural soprano, she
        traded in her slinky lower register to tackle the higher
        keys dictated by ''Evita,'' and she infused her singing
        with the bogus dramatics mandated by a musical. </p>
        <p>This isn't the pop Madonna fans love, and she hasn't
        magically transformed into an astounding voice who'll win
        over theater elitists. Yet she seems to have done the
        best she could do with what she has. </p>
        <p>No matter how well Madonna has done, ''Evita'' could
        easily flop. How long has it been since a Broadway
        musical made a successful translation to film? Decades?
        Does Peoria want this? As far as that goes, Madonna is an asset
        more than a liability: A Patti LuPone in the starring
        role would have been a certain disaster in mainstream
        America. At least Madonna gives it a chance. </p>
        <p>So a better question might have been ''Why put 'Evita'
        on film at all?'' </p>
        <p>And here's one for the soundtrack: ''Where's the
        libretto?'' </p>
        <p>The disc insert brimming with pictures of Madonna
        wearing brown contacts isn't much of a service. If Warner
        Bros. wanted to bring appreciation of musical theater to
        the legions of Madonna fans who don't know ''Rent'' from
        ''Miss Saigon,'' how could the company overlook the need
        for printed lyrics? </p>
        <p>Sure, Madonna and Jonathan Pryce (a Tony-winner who
        plays Juan Peron) enunciate well enough. But Antonio
        Banderas -- who plays Che, the narrator, and has
        seemingly more lines than anyone -- is often as hard to understand
        here as he has been in his previous movies. </p>
        <p>As relayed in ''Evita,'' the story of Eva Peron is a
        simple one. She was a poor nobody from nowhere who moved
        to Buenos Aires. She became a celebrity, fell in love
        with a powerful man, inspired her country with her mighty
        charisma and got cut down by cancer at age 33. </p>
        <p>Webber and Rice embellished her story with melodrama,
        threw in a few props and put on a show. </p>
        <p>The soundtrack has its share of effective moments --
        some invigorating choruses and chants and Madonna pouring
        her soul into the showcase song ''Don't Cry for Me
        Argentina.'' ''Evita'' has many weak stretches, too -- particularly
        the lame, dated electric guitars and other such '70s
        moments. </p>
        <p>Recognizing a need for a hit single, Webber and Rice
        concocted a new number for the movie, ''You Must Love
        Me.'' But it's hard to hear Madonna tiptoe through the
        song's artificiality or the soundtrack's overall bombast
        without craving a sexy ''Justify My Love'' or buoyant
        ''Express Yourself.'' </p>
        <p>Rating (five possible): XX 1/2 </p>
        <h3>LE ROI EST MORT, VIVE LE ROI! Enigma (Virgin)</h3>
        <p>Enigma is hardly a puzzle anymore. </p>
        <p>Whereas 1993's ''The Cross of Changes'' was a modest
        growth from the act's 1990 breakthrough ''MCMXC a.D.,''
        Enigma's new ''Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!'' is a
        rehash of those first two albums with scarcely a thing to
        call its own. </p>
        <p>Though that's no tragedy, it's a shame Enigma's
        driving force, Michael Cretu, is apparently tapped out of
        originality after such an exciting start. And he still
        hasn't learned that his own singing -- an indistinct, post-heavy-metal
        rasp -- pales against the other vocals he uses, including chanting
        monks and the cosmic musings of his wife, Sandra. </p>
        <p>At any rate, ''Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!'' is an
        entrancing journey back into the surreal landscapes
        painted by earlier Enigma works. </p>
        <p>The somnambulistic pacing of the rhythms is
        appropriate for the dreamlike aura created by the gentle
        gyrations of synthetic chords and ethereal vocals (with
        unfortunate interruptions by Cretu's out-of-place
        antics): It's ideal music for unwinding, no doubt going
        great with aromatherapy and candles. </p>
        <p>The track ''Beyond the Invisible'' is one of Enigma's
        best singles, marked by overlapping layers of lush music
        and samples that vie for attention against a world-music
        free-for-all of vocals dominated by a mournful looping
        chant. </p>
        <p>Otherwise ''Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!'' is a
        relatively nondescript, yet persuasively strong sedative </p>
        <p>Rating: XXX 1/2 </p>
        <h3>''BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA'' SOUNDTRACK,
        various acts (Geffen)</h3>
        <p>Beavis and Butt-Head get a little help from their
        friends for the soundtrack of their new movie, ''Beavis
        and Butt-Head Do America.'' </p>
        <p>The animated duo may be a little long in tooth to be
        coming out with their first film, but their MTV show has
        been holding its own over the years, and the hip
        soundtrack line-up is a bonus. </p>
        <p>The twosome's eclectic taste in music (they love both
        hard rock and old funk) is reflected on the album, which
        features bands they've praised on their show as well as
        some acts who contributed to the 1993 B&amp;B platinum album,
        ''The Beavis and Butt-Head Experience.'' </p>
        <p>A natural highlight is the funky Red Hot Chili Peppers
        cover of the Ohio Players' classic ''Love Rollercoaster''
        (a song that also served as the foundation for
        Salt-N-Pepa's groovy ''Champagne'' for the recent ''Bulletproof''
        soundtrack). </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, LL Cool J chips in a remake of the 1983
        Rufus hit ''Ain't Nobody,'' and Isaac Hayes delivers the
        theme song ''Two Cool Guys'' -- a clever marriage of the
        ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' TV theme and Hayes' classic
        ''Shaft.'' </p>
        <p>In keeping with B&amp;B's love of bruising bands, the
        soundtrack includes crushing tracks from White Zombie
        (''Ratfinks, Suicide Tanks and Cannibal Girls'') and the
        B'hole Surfers (''The Lord is a Monkey'') as well as a gratuitous
        oldie from AC/DC (''Gone Shootin' '') and an even more unwelcome
        new one from Ozzy Osbourne (''Walk on Water''). </p>
        <p>As with any soundtrack, there are throwaways --
        including a lesser track by the trendy No Doubt
        (''Snakes'') and an offensive rap song by the rote Madd
        Head (''Pimp 'n Ain't EZ''). </p>
        <p>A few campy songs round out the album: Southern
        Culture on the Skids' hilarious ''White Trash,'' the
        horn-laced ''I Wanna Riot'' by Rancid With Stubborn
        All-Stars, and ''Lesbian Seagull'' by the
        starved-for-attention Engelbert Humperdinck. </p>
        <p>Only Beavis and Butt-Head could get away with such
        puerile stuff. </p>

        one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five being the
        highest: </p>
        <p>-- PLATINUM ON BLACK VOL. 3, various acts (FFRR) </p>
        <p>A dance album has to be just right to avoid being all
        wrong. </p>
        <p>There are key elements. </p>
        <p>1. There can't be pauses between songs. Momentum, you
        know. </p>
        <p>2. There must be a variety of acts. No matter how good
        a particular band or singer may be, they can't monopolize
        the beat. It's a dance album, not a concert, and a
        solitary act is BORING after a song or two. </p>
        <p>3. There should be long stretches of instrumentation
        broken up by vocals. Too much singing is intrusive, but
        occasional vocals lend a human feel to what could
        otherwise become impersonal. </p>
        <p>''Platinum on Black Vol. 3,'' mixed by Jeff K., meets
        all the criteria in a most excellent way. </p>
        <p>To begin with, Jeff K. works with a premium selection
        of songs -- a solid mix of tracks that are distinct from
        each other, but not so scattershot that the album loses
        continuity. He blends '90s house music, '80s techno and
        '70s disco into an invigorating flow. </p>
        <p>Using tantalizing segues to bridge the songs to each
        other, Jeff K. builds excitement at just the right
        moment: Before a track loses staying power, little
        elements from the next song begin trickling through. </p>
        <p>For example, spirited percussion in the late stages of
        ''Inner City Life'' (by Goldie vs. Rabbit in the Moon)
        becomes the cornerstone for the Latin disco of ''La
        Tropicana'' (by Tropicana), which in turn picks up
        wobbling pulses that become essential to ''Keep on
        Jumpin' '' (by Lisa Marie Experience), which in turn
        takes on the gothic synthesizer strains of New Order's
        classic ''Blue Monday.'' </p>
        <p>Jeff K. is just doing his job, but few mixers
        demonstrate this much dexterity. </p>
        <p>Again, the collection of songs makes an enormous
        difference on ''Platinum on Black Vol. 3.'' Many of the
        tracks are remixes themselves, with numerous layers,
        shifts and breaks all their own. Their hard beats are
        always insistent and never pedestrian. </p>
        <p>Jeff K. can be faulted for allowing too many tracks to
        build in their own cooldowns, which leads to too many
        disruptions. And Incognito's ''Always There'' isn't up to
        snuff (it's a little heavy on the obnoxious diva
        quotient). </p>
        <p>Still, the riveting ''Platinum on Black Vol. 3'' could
        easily become the deciding factor in an explosive party
        or a motivating force behind an effective cardiovascular
        workout. </p>
        <p>Rating (five possible) XXXX </p>
        <p>-- NOTHING IN COMMON, various acts (Casual Tonalities)
        </p>
        <p>As modern-rock slides into a major-label void of
        creativity, the responsibility falls on the genre's
        mother, independent rock, to reinspire its wayward child.
        </p>
        <p>Not all indie acts are Pearl Jam wannabes -- a point
        made by the compilation album ''Nothing in Common.'' In
        fact, the album's considerable eclecticism is a
        confirmation of the vast diversity lurking about in the
        low-budget netherworld of indie rock. </p>
        <p>The selections aren't consistently good, but ''Nothing
        in Common'' is a small, yet heartening, indication there
        may be a cure for modern-rock's sickness. </p>
        <p>Cutting through the half dozen or so ho-hummers,
        listeners will find several gems among the album's 17
        tracks. </p>
        <p>Consider Japan's Pugs, who chip in a bone-crunching
        set on ''Mari in Love,'' balanced by the yodeling of
        their lead vocalist Honey K-Who. Then there's
        ''Sweetness'' by Action Plus, a demented blend of subdued
        exotica and sleek jazz, and ''Someday'' by Eenie Meenie,
        a shuffling electronic dance synthesis. </p>
        <p>Other winners include Guadaloop's gutsy ''Road Map,''
        the unsettling ''avant-rock'' of ''You Don't Have To
        Die'' by New York's Krackhouse and the aural overdrive of
        ''Ants'' by Miami's Haze. </p>
        <p>Even some of the knockoffs are respectable -- for
        instance Captain Krunch's homage to grunge (''Roam'') and
        the dreamy melody-consciousness of Jeff's ''Hope.''
        Meanwhile, there are a few attempts to marry alternative
        rock to country, but the unions are barren. </p>
        <p>What's significant here is that most of these bands
        are trying to be something more than Nirvana or R.E.M.
        sound-alikes. </p>
        <p>Their originality may not get some of them any further
        than gigs with small clubs (and in truth some don't sound
        good enough to be anything more than bar bands). Yet
        their imagination alone is worth respect. </p>
        <p>Rating: XXX 1/2 </p>
        <p>-- CLOSE GRIND, JB3 (NovaMute) </p>
        <p>''Close Grind'' is a perfect name for JB3's
        claustrophobic new record, and most conventionalists will
        find it a difficult listen. For that matter, many
        adventurists will be hard-pressed to appreciate the Joey
        Beltram creation. </p>
        <p>Electronic dance music doesn't get more fundamental
        than this: Beltram uses a few basic devices for each
        track then sends them looping back over and again. </p>
        <p>The repetitious mainframe of each song -- usually just
        a rhythm and some stray accompaniment -- is, essentially,
        all the track has. There may be </p>
        <p>some ''found'' sound that comes and goes with
        intensity, but the entire thrust of every song is set
        with the first few chords. </p>
        <p>Each of the nine tracks on this surreal, instrumental
        album is like a mini-soundtrack for a moment frozen in
        time. </p>
        <p>The rumble-and-thump songs have their distinctions:
        ''Believer'' features something that sounds like a board
        repeatedly falling against a wall; Presence sounds like
        an old Nintendo game stuck on a hitch and juiced up with
        a bass kick; a hollow tube sounds like the chief
        instrument of ''Upper,'' supported by a deep-gut,
        vibrating bass . . . </p>
        <p>Of course none of the tracks goes anywhere, but that's
        what makes them effective. </p>
        <p>Once some listeners learn to accept Beltram's work,
        they will be suckered in by the hypnotic simplicity of
        the atmosphere. But those who don't buy Beltram's ''less
        is more'' philosophy will find ''Close Grind''
        intolerable. </p>
        <p>Rating: XX 1/2 </p>

        News-Sentinel music critic</i></font></p>
        <p>''Bleed Your Cedar,'' Elysian Fields (Radioactive) </p>
        <p>The members of Elysian Fields aren't so much musicians
        as they are manipulators of style, and the spooky
        atmosphere of their full-length debut, ''Bleed Your
        Cedar,'' is crafty indeed. </p>
        <p>The New York band banks on its lead singer, Jennifer
        Charles, to put listeners under a spell, starting with
        her bewitching portrait on the cover -- tousled hair,
        black fingernails, evilly arched eyebrows accenting a
        lethal gaze, apparent toplessness . . . </p>
        <p>Fortunately, she can sing. </p>
        <p>Pitted against otherworldly guitars, lulling basslines
        and drifting keyboards, Charles slips into the hypnotic
        cadences with erotic grace. </p>
        <p>Although the groups are similar, the vampiric nature
        of Elysian Fields separates it from the icy detachment of
        Mazzy Star and the cool melancholy of Portishead. And
        Charles pours on the sexuality: ''I want to suck your motions,
        exercise devotion'' she beckons on the obsession-minded ''Rolling,''
        and on ''Parachute'' she coos, ''If you ever need a
        parachute/You can fall free with me, baby.'' </p>
        <p>Her chief collaborators are her co-songwriter and
        guitarist Oren Bloedow and pianist/guitarist Ed
        Pastorini. Bloedow and Pastorini also serve as producers
        of ''Bleed Your Cedar,'' which has surprising variety for
        such a narrowly focused project. </p>
        <p>Bloedow's sitar gives ''Off or Out'' a Mideastern
        flair, and Pastorini's ''Tubular Bells''-inspired piano
        offsets the grainy chug of ''Jack in the Box.'' Other
        aural inducements range from the inebriated jazz of the
        torchy ''Fountains on Fire'' to the acoustic sobriety of
        ''Mermaid.'' </p>
        <p>A certain level of affectation must be overlooked for
        ''Bleed Your Cedar'' to be fully satisfying. Elysian
        Fields only formed in 1995, so perhaps the group simply
        hasn't had time to master the art of subtlety. </p>
        <p>But as the band hones its sorcery, it could become a
        very dangerous outfit. </p>
        <p>Rating (five possible): * * * *</p>
        <p>''Party of Five'' soundtrack, various acts (Reprise) </p>
        <p>Most soundtrack albums are little more than haphazard
        compilations, and add to that the fact ''Party of Five''
        is a soundtrack for a FOX television show (vs. a
        blockbuster movie), and expectations should be low. </p>
        <p>Yet facing those same handicaps, FOX's ''X-Files''
        delivered a stylish soundtrack earlier this fall. </p>
        <p>Not so, ''Party of Five.'' It's more akin to the
        recently released ''Due South'' soundtrack (yes, even
        ''Due South'' has a soundtrack) -- an incongruous heap of
        songs thrown together and labeled. </p>
        <p>''Party of Five'' does get an unusual boost from
        several previously released songs, including Rusted
        Root's Talking Heads-ish ''Send Me on My Way,'' Nancy
        Griffith's somber ''It's a Hard Life Wherever You Go,''
        Chaka Khan's gentle ballad ''Love Me Still'' (featuring
        an understated Bruce Hornsby) and BT's alternadancey
        ''Blue Skies'' (featuring an animated Tori Amos). </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Bodeans' uplifting ''Closer to Free''
        is here as the ''Party of Five'' theme song -- and it has
        the same uplifting infectiousness of the Rembrandts'
        ''I'll Be There for You.'' Also like that hit single from ''Friends,''
        ''Closer to Free'' is nauseating after a couple of spins. </p>
        <p>Two noteworthy ''exclusive'' tracks on ''Party of
        Five'' are Stevie Nicks' grandmotherly cover of Tom
        Petty's ''Free Fallin' '' and Rickie Lee Jones' amusing
        cover of Donovan's ''Sunshine Superman.'' </p>
        <p>Otherwise, the album is rounded out by a handful of
        forgettable songs by acts either struggling to make a
        name for themselves or fighting not to lose what modest
        following they have. But none of these songs -- by Howard Jones,
        Shawn Colvin, Joe Jackson, Syd Straw, Laurie Sargent, Big
        Bad Voodoo Daddy and Holly Palmer -- do anything to
        support the cause. </p>
        <p>Actually, the soundtrack itself doesn't do much of
        anything, either. </p>
        <p>Rating: * * 1/2 </p>
        <p>''Mouse House,'' various acts (Walt Disney) </p>
        <p>Leave it to Disney to sterilize the dance floor. </p>
        <p>''Mouse House'' comes as something of a follow-up to
        1979's ''Mickey Mouse Disco,'' resetting the company's
        songs to dance-oriented beats. </p>
        <p>The worst move Disney made was dragging Donna Summer
        in to lay new vocals for ''Someday'' (from ''The
        Hunchback of Notre Dame'') and releasing that song as a
        single. Summer's ''comeback'' has been years in the making
        and so far hasn't yielded much, and the dance overhaul to ''Someday''
        is unimaginative anyway. </p>
        <p>Likewise unimpressive is the blatant Macarena lilt
        given to a refashioned ''The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room'' (from
        attractions at Disneyland and Walt Disney World -- the
        only song on ''Mouse House'' not from a Disney movie). </p>
        <p>However, competent producers were brought to the
        project, and sometimes their results are surprising: Rob
        Chiarelli (who has remixed songs by Madonna, Janet
        Jackson and Coolio) stirs great chemistry into the ''Cinderella''
        song ''So This Is Love,'' modernizing the 48-year-old
        number into a saucy neo-disco treat. Chiarelli also
        throws a slapping beat and a few traces of techno into
        ''Colors of the Wind'' (from ''Pocahontas''), which features
        new vocals by '90s dance diva Robin S. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, SKY pulls out some crafty studio tricks --
        snippets of dialogue and lots of humming, buzzing and
        churning electronics -- to reinvent ''Cruella De Vil''
        (from ''101 Dalmatians''), and Marco Marinangeli freshens up
        the title track of ''Beauty and the Beast.'' </p>
        <p>''Mouse House'' reaches a spirited conclusion with
        Michael Becker's take on ''Topsy Turvy'' (from ''The
        Hunchback of Notre Dame'') -- one of the liveliest songs
        in the Disney artillery, and one well-suited to its new
        techno inflections. </p>
        <p>The remaining five tracks -- two each from ''The
        Little Mermaid'' and ''The Lion King'' and one more from
        ''Pocahontas'' -- are insipid remixes better suited for
        Barney than a nightclub. </p>
        <p>Maybe that's just Disney's way of remembering the
        kids. </p>

        <p><font size="5">T</font>he rating is done on a basis of
        one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five being the
        highest: </p>
        <p>-<strong>- DANCE INTO THE LIGHT, Phil Collins
        (Atlantic) </strong></p>
        <p>So much has changed for Phil Collins since his last
        album, 1993's ''Both Sides,'' that he probably believes
        his new ''Dance Into the Light'' is a dramatic career
        departure. </p>
        <p>Since ''Both Sides,'' Collins has divorced, taken a
        new lover, moved to Switzerland and quit the band
        Genesis. </p>
        <p>However, although ''Dance Into the Light'' is more
        upbeat than ''Both Sides,'' it's still the same Phil
        Collins. </p>
        <p>After enough years of service, people in virtually any
        profession hit plateaus. Collins has been on a plateau
        for some time, and despite the changes in his life,
        ''Dance Into the Light'' reflects little growth and only
        a tad of experimentation. </p>
        <p>His best claims to innovation on ''Dance Into the
        Light'' are the African rhythms that surface from time to
        time. But if this is his (decade late) answer to Paul
        Simon's ''Graceland,'' it's so watered down as to be
        inconsequential. </p>
        <p>Collins fails completely with his lyrics, using a
        combination of weak modifications to formula and outright
        cliches. He compounds the mundanity with hollow delivery
        -- weaving from songs about generic liberation to
        devotional tracks to tales of betrayal and hurt. Whatever
        the theme, he knocks out the vocals without conviction. </p>
        <p>Musically, he returns to the sunny pop enthusiasm that
        served him well in the '80s -- and indeed some of the
        better songs (the self-consciously catchy, horn-driven
        title track, the heady-yet-bland ''River So Wide'') would
        fit a retrospective soundtrack for the Me Decade. </p>
        <p>Likewise too familiar is his approach on the more
        subdued material -- when he pines gracefully for lost
        love on ''The Same Moon,'' for example, or when the
        bassline permeates a wash of synthesizers on ''Oughta
        Know by Now.'' Meanwhile, ''Just Another Story'' sounds
        like a script outline for an episode for the long-defunct
        ''Miami Vice.'' </p>
        <p>Most ironic is his recasting of Bob Dylan's ''The
        Times They Are A-Changin' '' in an '80s power-pop mode. </p>
        <p>Stagnation, insincerity and an inordinate number of
        vapid filler tracks cast a dark shadow on ''Dance Into
        the Light.'' </p>
        <p>Rating (five possible): XX </p>
        <p>-<strong>- FITZCARRALDO, The Frames DC (Elektra) </strong></p>
        <p>It's not often a street performer gets a shot at a
        record deal. But The Frames DC -- a group of five former
        buskers based in Dublin, Ireland -- capitalize on their
        second such contract with ''Fitzcarraldo.'' </p>
        <p>After failing with an effort on Island Records -- a
        release Frames' lead singer Glen Hansard calls ''a
        half-baked punk album'' -- Elektra Records gave the band
        another chance. </p>
        <p>The Frames DC cash in with ''Fitzcarraldo,'' a
        well-developed album with only a couple of half-baked
        miscues -- namely cheesy theatrics on ''Angel at My
        Table'' and overbearing whining on ''Denounced.'' </p>
        <p>Although progressive enough to suit modern-rock
        playlists (the track ''Monument'' seems particularly
        contrived for the fickle genre), ''Fitzcarraldo'' is a
        timeless rock album that mostly evades trends. Plus group
        violinist Colm MacConIomaire gives the album a dignified
        lift -- lending personality to the epic title track, for
        example. </p>
        <p>''Fitzcarraldo'' kicks off with a rousing
        ''Revelate,'' which blasts apocalyptic guitar interludes
        between Hansard's emotional verses: He wearily confesses
        ''sometimes it's easy just to hate you,'' and by the end
        of the song is angrily demanding, ''Redeem yourself.'' </p>
        <p>''Giving It All Away'' is another effective mood
        piece, balancing the brooding singer with the
        electromania of edgy guitars. </p>
        <p>Yet the Frames DC are also skilled at simmering songs
        -- ''Evergreen'' is laced with mysticism, ''Red Chord''
        rides Hansard's tragic delivery, ''Your Face'' is an
        unexpectedly tender closer, and before it arches off into
        melodrama, the ponderous ''In This Boat Together'' is an
        excellent overview of an ill-fated couple locked in
        commitment. </p>
        <p>The downcast mood of the album gets tiresome (a la
        Pearl Jam), and the band does have its indiscretions. But
        ''Fitzcarraldo'' ought to keep these Irishmen off the
        streets. </p>
        <p>Rating: XXXX </p>
        <p><strong>-- IMA, BT (Perfecto/Kinetic/Reprise) </strong></p>
        <p>On her 1996 self-produced album, Tori Amos struggled
        with bad judgment, indulging her whims to the detriment
        of the record's focus. </p>
        <p>Now she has aligned herself with a man who makes her
        seem restrained by comparison. </p>
        <p>Brian Transeau, who bills himself simply as ''BT,''
        conspires with Amos on his debut, ''Ima.'' He milks the
        collaboration for nearly 18 minutes over two songs -- a
        spacey dance track, ''Blue Skies,'' and an overblown
        remixed version of the same song (''The Delphinium Days
        Mix'') that first hitches into an electric groove, then
        wraps into a vocal swirl, then degenerates into
        disjointed noise, then drains the life out of the
        singer's vocals as loops are reiterated ad nauseum. </p>
        <p>That's only the beginning of the excess: ''Ima'' is a
        two-disc debut that clocks in at more than 138 minutes. </p>
        <p>One track alone -- ''Sasha's Voyage of Ima'' -- is
        more than 42 minutes. (That's longer than an entire album
        for many acts.) And though there are some viable grooves
        sequenced into the mix, a song like that is more about
        the listener's will to endure than the performer's
        ability to amuse. </p>
        <p>BT's work is good in small doses. He creates a New Age
        genre for Generation X, electronic dance that embraces
        world music and esoteric sound effects. By themselves,
        the high-intensity surrealism of ''Nocturnal
        Transmission'' and the churning ''Deeper Sunshine'' are
        fresh and imaginative. </p>
        <p>Then there's ''Embracing the Sunshine,'' which is a
        potent composite of the first eight tracks of the first
        disc. </p>
        <p>But BT is out of control, not only pounding his
        gimmicks to death, but reviving them on the next track to
        pound them to death again. And it goes on for more than
        two and a quarter hours, which is just stupefying. </p>
        <p>Rating: XX </p>

        <font size="5">T</font>he rating is done on a basis of
        one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five being the
        highest: </p>
        <p>-- ONE FIERCE BEER COASTER, Bloodhound Gang
        (Geffen/Republic) </p>
        <p>''I'm the root of all that's evil, yeah, but you can
        call me Cookie,'' sings Jimmy Pop Ali, lead vocalist and
        overall top dog of the Bloodhound Gang on the group's hit
        single, ''Fire Water Burn.'' </p>
        <p>Singing flatly against what begins as acoustic support
        then erupts into an electrified Weezer-ly chug, Ali
        grinds through an expletive-not-deleted free-for-all of
        irreverence, suggesting Lawrence Welk, Kurt Cobain and
        others are in hell, Emmanuel Lewis is the Antichrist and
        the roof (the roof, the roof) is on fire and should just
        be left to burn. </p>
        <p>The Philadelphia-area band's raunchy ''One Fierce Beer
        Coaster'' was released on Republic Records in September
        but got a major-label break from Geffen, which
        re-released the album (minus two tracks) in December. </p>
        <p>It's sure to offend both humorless PC extremists and
        the religious right, but those likely aren't the target
        demographics for the group anyway. Ali's work -- which at
        a glance might be taken as sexist, racist, homophobic and
        godless -- is ribald parody at its best. Self-effacing
        and admittedly juvenile, Ali is far more clever than he
        lets on. </p>
        <p>For starters, the album is more diverse than it has
        any right to be. From full-tilt punk tracks to slamming
        rap to the funkiest hip-hop/rock concoction since vintage
        Big Audio Dynamite, ''One Fierce Beer Coaster'' is an
        innovative marvel. If it were only an instrumental album,
        it would be worthy. </p>
        <p>But Jimmy Pop Ali at the mike makes this an essential
        album to anyone who can cope with a little distasteful
        humor. </p>
        <p>Confessing to an embarrassing physical shortcoming
        (more than once), he boasts of his compensating sexual
        talents; he embraces nerdom but still tells the world
        where to get off (''I hate people that think that I care
        what they think,'' he says on ''Shut Up''); and he longs
        to be a handsome pseudo-gay man so he can get chicks
        (''Scoring with a supermodel would be easy''). </p>
        <p>That B.A.D.-sounding track, ''Lift Your Head Up High
        (And Blow Your Brains Out),'' is a particular triumph as
        Jimmy Pop Ali leads his chanting band in a mantra against
        self-pitiers, ''Life's short and hard like a
        body-buidling elf/So save the planet and kill yourself.''
        </p>
        <p>This guy even does a blithe braggadocio duet with
        Vanilla Ice on the reverberating ''Boom.'' Talk about
        guts. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Ali's hilarious cultural references bridge
        baby boomers to Generation X: He dreams up a morbidly
        violent ''Gilligan's Island'' scenario on ''Why's
        Everybody Always Pickin' on Me?'', and ''Your Only
        Friends Are Make Believe'' has Mr. Rogers going off on
        his mailman before Ali overtly digs at Duran Duran,
        swiping the chorus melody from DD's ''Hungry Like the
        Wolf'' for his own chorus. </p>
        <p>And in a nod to fans, there's the anthemic ''Going
        Nowhere Slow,'' which is a roll call of 70-odd cities
        where the band likes to play . . . ''but nowhere in New
        Jersey.'' </p>
        <p>That's New Jersey's loss. </p>
        <p>Rating (five possible): XXXX </p>
        <p>-- GOUDS THUMB, Gouds Thumb (Critique) </p>
        <p>Far be it from the Maine-based band Gouds Thumb to
        break modern rock out of its winter of discontent. </p>
        <p>Instead, the four-man group falls in line with the
        genre on a self-titled debut that features overplayed
        instruments, oversung vocals and underdeveloped songs. </p>
        <p>The single ''29'' (which features supporting vocals by
        Matthew Sweet) and ''Beautiful Local'' stand apart from
        other tracks thanks to their memorable refrains. But the
        blustery ''Gouds Thumb'' is primarily an aggressive, yet
        characterless, acting-out by a band indistinguishable
        from hordes of other groups. </p>
        <p>Lead singer Connor, whose emotional range mimics the
        Vedderesque screech-and-groan, handicaps Gouds Thumb with
        disconnected, unenlightening lyrics -- inadequate
        attempts at symbolism that he belts out with plaintive
        importance. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, guitarist Walter Craven, bass player Jeff
        Kral and drummer Bernard Willimann are locked in
        unimaginative drudgery of their own. </p>
        <p>Rarely backing off from the stormy sameness of the
        bulk of tracks, the band gears down twice: once for a
        brush with psychedelia on ''Chemicals'' and again on the
        moany ''Apnea'' (which is reprised at album's end as a
        gratuitous ''hidden'' track). Beyond ''29'' and
        ''Beautiful Local,'' the only saving grace to this album
        is its power. </p>
        <p>The glut of bands like Gouds Thumb is shutting down
        what was once a vivacious offshoot of popular music. And
        the term ''progressive rock,'' once used interchangeably
        with ''modern rock,'' no longer applies. </p>
        <p>Rating: XX </p>
        <p>-- ''ALL THAT: THE ALBUM,'' various acts (Loud) </p>
        <p>''All That: The Album'' is a choice overview of
        today's most promising young R&amp;B acts, but it isn't
        much of a testimonial to the humor in the sketch comedy
        show ''All That.'' </p>
        <p>The album is a promotional vehicle for the program,
        and it includes songs by nine music acts as well as
        excerpts from the youth-oriented Nickelodeon show. </p>
        <p>Those bits from the skits are decidedly feeble. (One
        interlude is nothing but a girl declaring, ''If you don't
        know the difference between baloney and your underwear,
        then I ain't eatin' a sandwich at your house!'') </p>
        <p>On the other hand, the collection of songs -- most of
        them hits from the past couple of years -- is rather
        strong. </p>
        <p>The male band Soul for Real chips in the harmony-rich
        ''Candy Rain,'' for example, while its female
        counterpart, MoKenStef, contributes a sleek ''He's
        Mine.'' </p>
        <p>Teen divas Brandy and Aaliyah are represented by the
        funky ''Baby'' and the jazz-inflected ''Age Ain't Nothing
        But a Number,'' respectively. And though her song gets a
        bit numbing, the silky voiced Faith Evans delivers a fine
        ''You Used To Love Me.'' </p>
        <p>A pair of rap tracks make the cut, too -- Coolio's
        springy ''Fantastic Voyage'' and Naughty by Nature's
        boisterous ''Clap Yo' Hands.'' </p>
        <p>''All That: The Album'' includes two Immature songs --
        the solid new track ''Watch Me Do My Thing'' and the
        plucky, mid-tempo devotional, ''We Got It'' -- and the
        trio TLC also is here twice -- once with the show's
        opening theme and once with the closer. </p>
        <p>To its credit, the album doesn't slip in lesser tracks
        and nobodies. These are all relatively big names on more
        or less equal footing. Although their songs aren't
        overflowing with originality, they're competently
        performed. </p>
        <p>To its discredit, the album slips in undeniably lame
        attempts at humor. </p>
        <p>Rating: XXX </p>

        <p><font size="5">T</font>he rating is done on a basis of
        one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five being the
        highest: </p>
        <p>-- LEVANTE LAS MANOS, Artie The 1 Man Party (Scotti
        Bros.) </p>
        <p>The most encouraging developments in popular music
        lately have come from the all-encompassing world of dance
        music. </p>
        <p>Embracing everything from the child-safe Los del Rio
        to the jolting Chemical Brothers, the genre has a
        far-flung cast of acts sweeping into nightclubs -- and
        occasionally waltzing onto the charts -- from all
        directions. </p>
        <p>Dance music has long been a complicated network of
        performers careening through a maze of unpredictable and
        short-lived trends, their popularity dependent more on
        the whims of club DJs than those of radio programmers.
        Consequently, the mainstream has only been a parallel
        universe for dance-music acts, many of whom achieve
        lucrative careers and cult followings without benefit of
        a ''hit'' single and the resultant hype. </p>
        <p>Yet occasionally an act will bomb the populace,
        sneaking in under MTV radar and infiltrating every
        mom-and-pop radio station across the country. </p>
        <p>In 1996 ''Macarena'' was a tribute to the general
        public's vulnerability to such attacks. Other dance
        artists stormed the Top 100 last year, too, although
        their successes were modest by comparison. </p>
        <p>Artie The 1 Man Party's single ''A Mover la Colita''
        was one of those songs fortunate enough to win the
        mainstream lottery, and now the 22-year-old
        Mexican-American attempts to extend his record-store
        shelf life with the new ''Levante las Manos.'' </p>
        <p>Drawing heavily on his Latin heritage (and why not?
        Latin music is one of the biggest subsets of the genre),
        Artie roars out with the album's first single, ''Mami''
        -- a whistles-and-bells romp featuring the all-woman
        vocal group Vienna. </p>
        <p>The trumpeting ''Zumba'' and pounding ''Para Mi
        Gente'' also plug into Artie's exceptional energy, which
        he transfers both to his charismatic vocals and his
        invigorating arrangements. </p>
        <p>The new-style Latin bandleader and his producers have
        a solid repertoire: A jazz vibe is folded into the
        humming mix of ''Nenas Baincando,'' C + C Music Factory
        is reincarnated on ''Rescue Me,'' the slapping rhythm of
        ''Chica Bonita (Levante los Manos)'' won't be ignored . .
        . </p>
        <p>However, Artie's party hits a dead end with the
        momentum-crushing cheesy reggae of ''Mujer Es la
        Manera,'' and ''I Wanna Dance (Juana la Cubana)'' is too
        fractured to work. </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he's armed with enough material for a
        second offensive -- so long as the fickle powers of dance
        music haven't rendered his artillery obsolete. </p>
        <p>Rating (five possible): XXX 1/2 </p>
        <p>-- WAKE UP &amp; DREAM, Qkumba Zoo (Arista) </p>
        <p>From the perspective of the western world, South
        Africa has been nothing but a pop-culture wasteland,
        strictly a destination for exports. </p>
        <p>Although the nation's creative desert has been showing
        signs of fertility in the post-apartheid era, most of the
        pop acts to emerge have been uninspiring knockoffs of
        American, European and Australian acts. </p>
        <p>Qkumba Zoo is a stark exception. </p>
        <p>The group's ''Wake Up &amp; Dream'' does recall other
        bands, but the influences are numerous and diverse,
        blended uniquely by Qkumba Zoo into a vibrant package. </p>
        <p>There's a bit of the Cocteau Twins, a trace of Abba,
        maybe a hint of the Pet Shop Boys . . . and
        instrumentalist Owl also streamlines distinctly African
        beats into the music that may appear reminiscent of
        Enigma or Deep Forest. But such rhythms are an indigenous
        source for Qkumba Zoo, not something Owl had to fetch
        from another land. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, singer Levannah is an effervescent
        presence, often a striking sound-alike to Debbie Harry,
        but occasionally something of an Olivia Newton-John or
        even a Karen Carpenter. </p>
        <p>It all comes together in an unimaginable rave/folk/pop
        concoction, both modern and primitive. </p>
        <p>The fascinating curiosities range from ''Big's''
        springy synthetic hoe-down to ''Into the Night's''
        Ace-of-Base-meets-Yello dark etherealism to ''Mermaid's''
        evocative mix of soft-sell techno and shimmering dance to
        ''Happy Earthday's'' fluttering innocence. </p>
        <p>There's a well-honed naive undertone that becomes
        almost cloying with sweetness on the self-aware slow
        tracks ''Cloud Eyes (I'm Scared, You're Scared),''
        ''Weeping'' and ''Big Mothership'' -- not to mention a
        couple of little stories Levannah manages to tell without
        benefit of instrumentation. </p>
        <p>Yet Qkumba Zoo always sounds sincere. </p>
        <p>Rating: XXXX 1/2 </p>
        <p>-- YOU CAN'T STOP THE REIGN, Shaquille O'Neal
        (T.W.Is.M.) </p>
        <p>As if rap didn't have enough problems with
        credibility, along comes Shaquille O'Neal with ''You
        Can't Stop the Reign.'' </p>
        <p>This monument to ego is on the NBA superstar's own
        label, T.W.Is.M. (which aptly stands for ''The World Is
        Mine''). </p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Laker has already picked the pockets
        of his adoring, mostly young, fans with two previous
        albums, ''Shaq Diesel'' and ''Shaq Fu -- da Return.'' But
        his attempts to prostitute himself in all forms of media
        (a la Michael Jordan) were dealt a blow when his movie
        ''Kazaam'' mopped the floors of theaters nationwide this
        past fall. </p>
        <p>The ebonics poster boy is a lousy rapper, lumbering
        along the leaden beats with confoundingly inane and
        appallingly conceited strings of numbing cliches (though
        there's the startling use of the word ''expeditiously''
        on ''Best to Worst''). For added nausea, there are
        wretched overhauls administered to the Phil
        Collins-penned ''In the Air Tonight'' and the Janet
        Jackson hit ''Let's Wait Awhile.'' </p>
        <p>O'Neal's shrewd move is to surround himself by an army
        legitimate artists -- including Snoop Doggy Dogg, Bobby
        Brown and a host of talented, unknown singers. In fact,
        whenever O'Neal isn't around (which is surprisingly
        often), the album isn't so bad. </p>
        <p>Shaq needs to get over himself, stay out of the studio
        and work on his free throws. </p>

		<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>n endurance ride is a race, although many contestants choose to ride the marked trail at their own pace. Distances vary from 25, 50, 75 or 100 miles in one day to multi-day rides, where the horse-and-rider team covers up to 250 miles in five days. The maximum time limit is 6 hours for 25 miles, 12 for 50 and 24 hours to complete a one-day 100-mile course.
<P>   Most endurance rides are sanctioned by the American Endurance Ride Conference, which requires strict veterinary supervision. Any breed of horse or mule is welcome, but the animal must be at least 4 years old for 25-milers and 5 or older to compete in distances of 50 miles or more.
<P>   AERC sanctions about 500 rides annually. The closest one to Knoxville is the Big South Fork Endurance Ride held in October. 
<P>   For more information, contact the American Endurance Ride Conference, 701 High St.-Suite 203, Auburn CA 95603 (916-823-2260). Or point your browser to http//:www.endurance.net for ride schedules, rule descriptions, listserv and advertisers.

		<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><FONT SIZE="+2">H</FONT>ow do you pack for a 12-hour day on a horse in the wilderness? A day that can be in the 80s or may bring snow? 
<P>Carefully, and with the worst-case scenario in mind:
<P>     *  Water: I pack four water bottles: two on the saddle and two in the wither bags that hang on either side of the horse&#39;s shoulders.
<P>    *  Horse food and supplies: In the left wither bag are grain, carrots, electrolytes, hoof pick. 
<P>*  Rider food, supplies: In the right side are gorp (homemade trail mix with raisins, M&Ms, peanuts), sesame sticks,  homemade beef jerky, camera (disposable ones are great), a Powerbar, Advil.  
<P>*  Essentials: In a mini-waist pack are personal hygiene items, knife, map, lip balm/sunscreen, emergency space blanket, waterproof matches, a Powerbar, a mini-flashlight. This pack holds what I&#39;ll need if Salazar and I get separated (grim thought), but it&#39;s soft enough that I won&#39;t break a rib if I fall on it. 
<P>*  Extra clothes for both: I add a &#39;&#39;rump rug&#39;&#39; to the saddle that can be unrolled to keep Salazar&#39;s hindquarters from cramping in the cold, along with a Gore-Tex jacket for me. I also tie on a sponge to cool him off in creeks in case he gets overheated.
<P>*  Rider clothes: Polartec fleece tights, and layers (T-shirt, flannel shirt, Polartec jacket), gloves and helmet. Hiking boots work well, since I walk a lot to help the horse. 
<P>*  Horse tack: Most important is a saddle that fits. Salazar &#39;&#39;wears&#39;&#39; his usual, a custom-made DeSoto endurance model that looks like a cross between an English and a Western. A breast collar helps keep it in place and gives more surface to tie things to. A hackmore allows him to eat and drink more freely than a bit.

        <p>Waldo County forests are a kaleidoscope of brilliant

        Maine. </p>
        <p>Where's Waldo County, Maine? It's not as elusive as
        the character. </p>
        <p>If you check the ragged coastline of Maine on a map,
        find the wide Penobscot Bay. There's Waldo County. </p>
        <p>Waldo County is located in lowlands between Camden and
        Acadia. The county has 25 towns and one city, Belfast.
        It's the county seat for the 33,000 people who live in
        the 734-square mile township. </p>
        <p>Forest land covers more than 75 percent of the county;
        a near 20 percent is farmland. There are five lakes,
        almost two dozen ponds and numerous rivers, steams and
        brooks. </p>
        <p>Close major cities are Augusta, Maine's capital, 45
        miles to the southwest, Bangor, 40 miles to the
        northeast; and Bar Harbor, 58 miles to the east. </p>
        <p>Maine is almost as large as its five New England
        sister states combined. It covers 33,215 square miles.
        Ninety percent of Maine is forestland so it is nicknamed
        ''The Pine Tree State.'' </p>

        <p>Ofttimes in New England, the coastal Mainers are

        <p>The talk of the Downeasters still has a bit of
        Elizabethan English, although some areas retain traces

        <p>Mainers feel a linkage to the people of Southern

        <p>WALDO COUNTY, MAINE -- Maine is a place of colors.
        Maine is blue skies, green forests, scarlet lobsters,
        silvery perch, brown moose, lavender meadows and red
        barns. Pink, mauve and gold sunsets extend out to sea. </p>
        <p>Harbors bundled in mist reveal their colors slowly.
        Crimson tugboats hug docks while bobbing sailboats
        reflect the hues of the rainbow. Lobster traps are marked
        with brightly painted buoys. </p>
        <p>In autumn, Maine wears a beautiful coat of many
        colors. Blueberry barrens change to deep red. Groves of
        hickory, ash, walnut, oak and maple are a mix of fiery
        red, golden yellow, crisp orange and rich brown. </p>
        <p>Within weeks the landscape may be blanketed in snow.
        The spruce and fir will expose a bit of dark green and
        the granite shores will keep their muted brown and gray
        tones as waves roll in from the sea. </p>
        <p>Waldo County, Maine, has always been a locale of
        color. Industrious people used the region's bountiful
        resources. They logged the forests and sailed the chilly
        waters of the North Atlantic. Sturdy sailing masts were crafted
        from the tall, straight white pine. During the
        mid-to-late 19th century, Maine produced more wooden
        sailing ships than any state in the Union. In the
        1870s-1880s, one tenth of all deep water shipmasters in
        the American Merchant Marine hailed from Searsport, a
        village on Penobscot Bay. </p>
        <p>Ship captains rounded Cape Horn and sailed to India,
        China, Africa, South America and Europe. Their careers
        were lucrative, though very speculative. The sea captains
        of Searsport and the neighboring town of Belfast built
        fine homes -- the ''painted ladies'' of the Victorian
        era. They furnished them with European porcelains,
        Oriental silks, Indian and African teakwood and mahogany. </p>
        <p>Belfast and Searsport never let go of their maritime
        heritage, even when the era of great wooden ships ended.
        Harbors are busy with lobster boats and pleasure crafts. </p>
        <p>Downtown Belfast is alive with people.
        Nineteenth-century brick storefronts line the downtown
        streets and lead to neighborhoods of clapboard houses. In
        gardens, cosmos flowers dance in the wind and cats laze
        on sunny verandas. Children play in sandboxes, gardeners
        tend perennial beds. Rose arbors, gazebos, gazing balls
        and whirligigs furnish these outdoor settings. </p>
        <p>Visitors and residents are drawn to the Belfast Co-op,
        where the smell of freshly baked breads and baguettes
        entices buyers. Vincent's Restaurant and Weathervane
        Restaurant on the waterfront are gathering spots. </p>
        <p>In nearby Lincolnville, The Lobster Pound Restaurant
        has served fresh seafood since opening in 1957. This year
        more than 84,000 pounds of lobster were prepared for
        hungry guests. Owner Richard McLaughlin gives advice
        about cooking lobster -- ''Not too long, not too
        little.'' </p>
        <p>Searsport also tempts people with its fine food at
        Seafarer's Tavern and its collection of gift stores.
        Antique lovers can get lost in the numerous flea markets
        and shops. </p>
        <p>Art galleries and craft studios have established
        outstanding reputations. Shoppers can see coppersmiths
        working on weather vanes, fiber artists at looms, potters
        in the clay and woodcrafters carving and painting duck decoys. </p>
        <p>Perhaps the best way to see Maine is to follow the
        picturesque country roads that turn off like stray
        thoughts. You may chance upon Bayside, a 100-year-old
        community founded by Spiritualists. They built Gothic Revival-style
        cottages in tidy rows among towering oak trees and
        painted them a palette of color. You can take the ferry
        to Islesboro and catch a peek at the secluded vacation
        homes of Kirstie Alley and John Travolta. <img
        src="images/mained.jpg" align="right" hspace="7"
        vspace="7" width="325" height="219"></p>
        <p>You may find yourself in front of Liberty's old </p>
        <p><font size="2"><strong>A sea captain's home now
        servers as a bed and breakfast known as the Brass Lantern Inn,
        Searsports, Maine.</strong></font></p>
        <p>octagonal post office on Main Street. On bike paths
        near Liberty you are very likely to see State Senator Susan
        Longley. The daughter of a Maine governor, she returned
        to her home state after a dozen years in other countries,
        other places. The state has tradition of sending
        steadfast, non-nonsense politicians to Washington. Mainers
        refer to them as ''good timber,'' explains Longley,
        herself a very down-to-earth individual. </p>
        <p>Early residents to the region gave their communities
        patriotic names such as Liberty, Freedom, Prospect and
        Unity. In such towns one can see multitudes of church
        steeples, weather vanes, saltbox houses with neat shingles.
        Farmhouses are often extended by a series of ells,
        additions, sheds and barns. The towns are like gems in
        the landscape with little interruption of commercial
        clutter. </p>
        <p>An amble through Waldo County can lead to Lake St.
        George State Park. Here evergreens are reflected
        perfectly on the water. Perch fishing is a favorite
        pastime here and at Swan Lake State Park in Swansville.
        At Moose Point State Park, the shaggy hat racks venture
        on the shore to lick the salt from rocks. Bald eagles and
        sea ospreys sometimes are seen flying through the crystal
        clear air. </p>
        <p>Fort Knox State Park on the narrows of the Penobscot
        River reflects the naval heritage of the area. Its
        underground passageways and massive stonework make it a
        place of intrigue. The powder magazines, batteries, and
        officers' quarters are open for visitors. On display are
        two original hot shot furnaces for heating small cannon
        balls and a complete 15-inch Rodman cannon. The granite
        fort's construction began in 1844 and continued for 25
        years. It was named to honor America's first Secretary of War,
        Major Gen. Henry Knox, also the namesake of Knoxville and
        the Fort Knox located in Kentucky. </p>
        <p>As you cross Waldo County you can see that Mainers
        have great love for their land. They cherish its wild
        places, where moose, deer, foxes, black bears, raccoons
        and beavers roam among the sugar and silver maples, white
        and red oaks, yellow and white birches and blue and
        Norway spruces. </p>
        <p>Sheep, dairy and produce farms are like patchwork on
        rolling hills. Here they grow ''Big Blues'' and ''Macs,''
        blueberries and McIntosh apples. Families who operate
        farms often sell their goods at roadside stands. One can
        buy wild raspberry honey, blackberry jams, cranberry
        jellies, apple cider, pumpkins and a sampling of the 15
        varieties of apples grown in Maine. </p>
        <p>Mainers define themselves not only by the land, but
        also by the sea. The salty waters provide a livelihood
        for many residents. Commercial fishermen pulls great
        quantities of fish, scallops, shrimp and lobster from the
        Atlantic. </p>
        <p>At the Penobscot Marine Museum in Searsport, the
        seafaring heritage is illustrated through oil paintings,
        exhibits, artifacts, ship models and figure heads.
        ''Peapod boats,'' small, open rowing crafts distinctive
        to Maine, are on display. Visitor can see the very human
        side to seafaring by examining the tight-knit woolen
        gloves worn by fishermen or the long awls and augers used
        by shipwrights to built wooden hulls. Docents explain how
        the square-rigged ''Down Easters'' ships were constructed
        to carry much cargo and withstand ocean gales. A photo
        collection lets visitors gaze into the faces of hardy
        seamen. </p>
        <p>Tourists today follow the tradition set by 19th
        century Americans who vacationed in Maine. Penobscot Bay
        gives visitors a choice of shore, harbor, dock, pier
        bottom and deepsea fishing. Popular catches near shore include
        mackerel, flounder, blue fish or striped bass. The
        marinas in Waldo County offer sailboat and sea kayak
        rentals or excursions. </p>
        <p>In Belfast, you can find Andrew Wakeman at Chance
        Along Sailing Center. A slender man with curly
        salt-and-pepper hair, Wakeman gives sailing lessons
        aboard his 23-foot sloop ''Bolero.'' </p>
        <p>''It's wonderful sailing here,'' Wakeman says as he
        looks about Penobscot Bay. ''There are lots of things to
        see, hundreds of islands out there.'' </p>
        <p>As with many sailors, Wakeman has a stock of stories.
        He tells of adventure where the captain ''didn't have his
        glasses on, and didn't see the asterisks on the nautical
        charts. The stars mean submerged rock at low tide,''
        Wakeman explains. The ship hit jagged rock, and as
        Wakeman recalls how he and the others kept from going
        under, he spoke vividly of the numbing cold Atlantic
        waters. As if a personal epitaph, he cautions, ''You have
        to know where you are in the fog.'' </p>
        <p>Maine's coast is often thick o'fog. Lighthouses,
        dramatically situated on its granite shores, are
        hallmarks of the state. The Grindle Point Light shines across
        Islesboro at Ducktrap Harbor, and the Fort Point Light is
        on Cape Jellison. Here, a narrow road through deep piney
        woods brings you to the white beacon. The tranquility,
        beauty and serenity in abundance here are the mystique of
        Maine. </p>

        <td width="470"><font size="6"><b>Quest for equality</b></font><br>
        <font size="5"><br>
        It's time for us to fulfill the dream of Martin Luther
        King Jr.</font><p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        ''I have a dream,'' the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
        said in that famous speech in 1963 at the Lincoln
        Memorial in Washington, D.C. </p>
        <p>He dreamed big, and the man who won a Nobel Peace
        Prize for leading civil rights demonstrations
        characterized by nonviolence died for the dream. We honor
        him today. We honor him -- on the celebration of his
        birthday -- in the same way that we honor other American
        patriots. </p>
        <p>George Washington dreamed of a nation independent of
        England. Abraham Lincoln dreamed of a nation undivided. </p>
        <p>Martin Luther King dreamed of equality: ''I have a
        dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out
        the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to
        be self-evident; that all men are created equal.' '' </p>
        <p>We are closer to that dream today than we were when
        King made that speech during the march on Washington.
        However, we aren't there yet. </p>
        <p>We sat together, the two races, at the annual Labor,
        Business, Industry and Government Awards Luncheon at the
        downtown Radisson. But White House correspondent Deborah
        Mathis, the speaker, reminded us that we aren't quite
        there. </p>
        <p>Her speech focused on the importance of freedom and of
        education. Mathis, who writes a syndicated column that
        appears in The News-Sentinel, pointed out that, if we are
        afraid, we are not free. And as long as our children are
        cruising the streets in gangs, we are afraid. </p>
        <p>She also pointed out a contradiction in how we spend
        our tax money. We do not want to pay more for schools or
        education. But we are willing to pay for more prisons. </p>
        <p>It was a stirring, impassioned speech. Mathis is the
        daughter of a preacher, and she clearly inherited his
        gift for delivery. What that well-delivered speech did
        was make us think. </p>
        <p>Perhaps we continued to think as we observed the other
        events of King's birthday celebration: the symposium, the
        youth symposium, the parade. Perhaps we will continue to
        think during the WSJK/WKOP-TV tribute today and the unity
        march and program today at the University of Tennessee. </p>
        <p>Mathis encouraged us to fix ourselves before we begin
        fixing our community and the nation and the world. </p>
        <p>It begins with us, with each one of us as individuals.
        It is time to begin completing the dream that King
        fostered so many years ago. </p>
        <p>''And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to
        ring . . . we will be able to speed up that day when all
        of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and
        Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics (and Orthodox), will
        be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old
        Negro spiritual, 'Free at last! Free at last! Thank God
        Almighty, we are free at last!' '' </p>
        <p>Those last words from the spiritual are chiseled on
        King's tombstone. Let them also be engraved on our
        hearts. </p>

        <font size="5">W</font>ould you rather your tax money be
        spent on: </p>
        <p>A. Providing more jobs in Oak Ridge. </p>
        <p>B. Cleaning up the environment in Oak Ridge to make
        more land and facilities available to create more jobs. </p>
        <p>C. More government paper work. </p>
        <p>D. Meetings where bureaucrats talk for weeks and
        months. </p>
        <p>E. Plane fare for bureaucrats to fly back and forth to
        Washington. </p>
        <p>I kind of like A and B, and I think the less we have
        of C, D and E, the better. If you agree, then you should
        hope that the new secretary of energy also agrees. </p>
        <p>And somebody from the Knoxville-Oak Ridge metro area
        ought to convince him. </p>
        <p>There used to be one giant contract in Oak Ridge to
        handle production facilities and the Oak Ridge National
        Laboratory, and it included environmental cleanup. Then
        the Department of Energy started to break the contract up
        into pieces. Lockheed Martin has had the contract for the
        past 12 years. </p>
        <p>There has been a feeling lately that some
        environmental cleanup in Oak Ridge is actually being done
        at long last, and there is less talk, paperwork,
        contract-letting and fewer meetings. To start the
        paperwork over again seems to be counterproductive. </p>
        <p>DOE extended Lockheed Martin's contract for production
        facilities and the lab for two years. But a contract for
        environmental cleanup has been broken out separately and
        is being put up for bid. </p>
        <p>Secretary Hazel O'Leary probably thought one of the
        contracts ought to be thrown out as a bone to contractors
        since 1996 was an election year. </p>
        <p>So the department is about to ask if anybody wants to
        bid on the contract; they have asked for proposals on
        what should be in the contract, they will ask for bids on
        the contract and then let the contract. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Federico Pena is the new DOE secretary, and
        it will certainly take him a while to get up to speed on
        everything going on within the department and at all the
        federal facilities. Is anything likely to happen right
        away? </p>
        <p>At the rate the process is going, it could be two
        years before DOE gets around to even awarding a new
        contract. </p>
        <p>If another company gets the contract, there will be
        the inevitable delays as that company: A. Studies the
        waste sites. B. Reviews what's been done. C. Finds things
        to blame on the previous contractor. D. Has community
        meetings. E. Announces goals. F. Finds subcontractors. G.
        Meets with the state. H. Meets with Oak Ridge. I. Meets
        with DOE. Then maybe, after six months to a year,
        cleaning up the waste starts again. </p>
        <p>If Lockheed Martin is doing such a good job that the
        other two contracts were extended, then why not let them
        keep the environmental cleanup contract as well? </p>
        <p>That keeps the focus on cleanup instead of on more
        paperwork. </p>
        <p>The government contracting process is a time-consuming
        complicated mess that ought to be avoided at all costs.
        It would seem to be something that could be avoided in
        this case. </p>
        <p>There are other considerations as well. </p>
        <p>If there is one thing Oak Ridge needs right now, it is
        allies in Washington. As the federal role in Oak Ridge
        diminishes, it will be dicey to transition into private
        jobs without some tremendous dislocations. </p>
        <p>Lockheed Martin is a major government contractor at
        the Pentagon and at government facilities around the
        country. </p>
        <p>In other words, they have clout on Capitol Hill. </p>
        <p>That is the advantage in having one big company manage
        all the contracts in Oak Ridge. </p>
        <p>And if the environmental portion of the contract were
        extended to end the same time as the other two, it makes
        it more likely that Lockheed Martin would bid on all
        three. That keeps a company in place that has ties to the
        community and which has employees who are rooted in the
        community. </p>
        <p>I find these arguments persuasive, but I'm sure some
        other people may have a different opinion. </p>
        <p>I think it is an important issue for two reasons. </p>
        <p>Firstly, whether the contract is extended or not can
        be debated, but, since it is a major component of the
        local economy, it ought to be something of which local
        business and political leaders are at least aware. I
        would guess that some of them haven't a clue. </p>
        <p>Secondly, it points up the problem in having a dozen
        so-called industrial and business development agencies
        running around. There is no clearinghouse that sets
        priorities for the local economy. </p>
        <p>There ought to be one high-level group somewhere with
        the staff to keep tabs on the local economy and then sell
        the public, Congress and DOE on what ought to be done. </p>
        <p>It certainly isn't anything to be left to drift along.

        <p>There are other considerations as well. </p>
        <p>If there is one thing Oak Ridge needs right now, it is
        allies in Washington. As the federal role in Oak Ridge
        diminishes, it will be dicey to transition into private
        jobs without some tremendous dislocations. </p>
        <p>Lockheed Martin is a major government contractor at
        the Pentagon and at government facilities around the
        country. </p>
        <p>In other words, they have clout on Capitol Hill. </p>
        <p>That is the advantage in having one big company manage
        all the contracts in Oak Ridge. </p>
        <p>And if the environmental portion of the contract were
        extended to end the same time as the other two, it makes
        it more likely that Lockheed Martin would bid on all
        three. That keeps a company in place that has ties to the
        community and which has employees who are rooted in the
        community. </p>
        <p>I find these arguments persuasive, but I'm sure some
        other people may have a different opinion. </p>
        <p>I think it is an important issue for two reasons. </p>
        <p>Firstly, whether the contract is extended or not can
        be debated, but, since it is a major component of the
        local economy, it ought to be something of which local
        business and political leaders are at least aware. I
        would guess that some of them haven't a clue. </p>
        <p>Secondly, it points up the problem in having a dozen
        so-called industrial and business development agencies
        running around. There is no clearinghouse that sets
        priorities for the local economy. </p>
        <p>There ought to be one high-level group somewhere with
        the staff to keep tabs on the local economy and then sell
        the public, Congress and DOE on what ought to be done. </p>
        <p>It certainly isn't anything to be left to drift along.

        <p><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>he five-alarm fire that swept
        through musician Lionel Hampton's high-rise apartment in
        New York City earlier this month certainly called
        attention to the dangers of halogen lamps. </p>
        <p>The legendary Hampton, who is now 83, broke music's
        color line when he joined the Benny Goodman band in the
        1930s. The fire destroyed everything Hampton had from his
        distinguished career, including his vibraphone. </p>
        <p>It took 200 firefighters more than two hours to bring
        the fire under control. Twenty-seven people were injured.
        The fire started when a halogen lamp in Hampton's
        apartment tipped over and ignited bedding. </p>
        <p>Norman Hammitt, public information officer for the
        Knoxville Fire Department, says since 1992 there have
        been 10 deaths and 20 injuries nationally related to
        halogen lamps and the bulbs used in them. </p>
        <p>No injuries or deaths have been recorded in Knoxville,
        but County Fire Marshal Wayne Waggoner notes that there
        were three fires in Knox County attributed to halogen
        lamps within the past 60 days. </p>
        <p>An apartment and a house sustained minor damage
        because the occupants were able to extinguish the fires
        promptly, but the third fire destroyed a house. </p>
        <p>''They're dangerous,'' said Waggoner, noting that the
        bulbs can get so hot they set anything around them on
        fire. </p>
        <p>In one of the Knox County fires, the halogen lamp's
        500-watt bulb ignited adjacent curtains; in another fire,
        the bulb's heat ignited a bookshelf made of particle
        board. </p>
        <p>The bulbs used in halogen lamps can reach temperatures
        of up to 1,500degrees, Hammitt noted. By comparison, a
        75-watt incandescent bulb's temperature will reach
        260degrees. </p>
        <p>Last month, the Tensor Corp. voluntarily recalled
        100,000 of the 500-watt tubular halogen bulbs sold in
        50,000 torchiere (or pole) style lamps. </p>
        <p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission advises
        that halogen bulbs may shatter during use, presenting a
        fire hazard when hot filaments of the shattered bulb land
        on nearby combustible materials. The CPSC has recorded
        281 incidents of bulbs shattering. </p>
        <p>While it is recommended to replace the 500-watt bulb
        with a lower 300-watt bulb, Waggoner is still leery,
        noting that the 300-watt bulb can reach a temperature of
        nearly 1,000degrees. </p>
        <p>Hammitt, Waggoner and the CPSC offer these safety
        tips: </p>
        <p>* Never place halogen lamps where the tubular bulb
        could come in contact with curtains or other cloth window
        treatments. Keep them away from elevated beds, such as
        bunk beds, where bedding might get too close to the bulb.
        </p>
        <p>* Never leave a halogen lamp on when you leave the
        room or are not at home. </p>
        <p>* Never drape clothes, paper or flammable material
        over a halogen lamp. </p>
        <p>* For torchiere lamps equipped with a dimmer switch,
        operate the lamp at a setting lower than the maximum
        whenever possible. </p>
        <p>Lionel Hampton is fortunate that he escaped without
        injury, but it is still a tragedy that he lost a
        priceless collection of mementoes, including records,
        music, instruments as well as photographs and letters
        from presidents dating back to Harry S Truman. </p>
        <p>Our fire officials want to be sure the same thing does
        not happen to you. </p>

        <td width="470"><font size="6"><b>Wamp renews campaign
        finance reform<!--SUBHEAD--></b></font><p><font size="2"><i>By Richard
        Powelson News-Sentinel Washington bureau</i></font></p>
        <p><br>
        <font size="5">R</font>ep. Zach Wamp has a great idea on
        how to make progress toward reforming the severely flawed
        campaign financing system. </p>
        <p>In partisan Washington, however, that can mean Wamp's
        plan will be shipped by congressional leaders to
        Warehouse No. 86926, never to be seen again. </p>
        <p>Party leaders often don't grab great ideas unless they
        can make their respective party look good for suggesting
        something and the other party look bad for opposing it. </p>
        <p>When is the last time that you saw House Speaker Newt
        Gingrich and Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt at a
        press conference saying they both backed a major new
        initiative and that neither party was going to claim
        credit for thinking of it? It doesn't happen. </p>
        <p>Wamp, a Chattanooga Republican, is one of only about a
        dozen House members who refuse political donations from
        interest groups, also known as political action
        committees or PACs. Another is Van Hilleary, a Spring
        City Republican. </p>
        <p>So, it makes sense that Wamp would favor campaign
        finance reform. </p>
        <p>Wamp's idea is simple. He wants the House leaders from
        both parties to name a bipartisan panel with an equal
        number of House members from each party and give them
        three months to produce a campaign finance reform package
        with attractive elements for both parties. </p>
        <p>He figures that an outside commission would not be
        plugged in well enough to draft something that Congress
        could pass. </p>
        <p>Well, Wamp suggested his idea Nov. 25 in letters to
        House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, and to
        Democratic leader Richard Gephardt. Neither leader has
        responded to date. </p>
        <p>Party leaders now have other matters on their minds.
        Democrats are trying to make Gingrich look as bad as
        possible over his ethics case and his Dec. 21 admission
        of providing false information to the House Ethics
        Committee and to seek as severe a punishment as they can
        get. Democrats also are hoping the whole ordeal takes
        more of the shine off all Republican candidates in
        voters' minds. </p>
        <p>Republicans are gearing up for another year of Clinton
        bashing. They are planning hearings and endless
        discussions over whether the Democratic National
        Committee and the Clinton-Gore campaign broke laws in
        receiving donations from foreign individuals and
        companies last year. Also, both parties will be accusing
        the other of terrible proposals for the 1998 budget
        cycle. </p>
        <p>A big difficulty in campaign finance reform is that
        many Republicans don't want to ban campaign donations
        from business interests which give generously to them.
        Many Democrats don't want to cut off the labor groups'
        donations that go primarily to their candidates. </p>
        <p>Many Democrats like the idea of public financing of
        congressional races in a fashion similar to the matching
        funds given presidential primary candidates. Most
        Republicans oppose public funds in congressional races. </p>
        <p>Wamp is hoping that the pressure of a deadline would
        prompt a task force to come up with a workable plan. He
        favors ending interest groups' donations to campaigns but
        realizes that ban could be found unconstitutional by the
        courts. So, he is proposing a way to neutralize part of
        the influence of PACs. </p>
        <p>He proposes to lower what a PAC may donate per
        candidate from the current $5,000 per election to $2,000.
        Then he would raise what individuals may give from the
        current $1,000 to $2,000 per candidate per election. </p>
        <p>Also, Wamp would force candidates to go home for more
        fund raising, requiring that a majority of total funds
        come from individuals living in the candidate's home
        state. </p>
        <p>As one of the newest House members, Wamp still is
        hopeful that House leaders eventually will do the right
        thing and clean up campaign fund raising. He promises to
        follow up on his idea with Gingrich after some
        distractions disappear. </p>

        finance reform<!--SUBHEAD--></b></font><p><font size="2"><i>By Richard
        Powelson News-Sentinel Washington bureau</i></font></p>
        <p><br>
        <font size="5">R</font>ep. Zach Wamp has a great idea on
        how to make progress toward reforming the severely flawed
        campaign financing system. </p>
        <p>In partisan Washington, however, that can mean Wamp's
        plan will be shipped by congressional leaders to
        Warehouse No. 86926, never to be seen again. </p>
        <p>Party leaders often don't grab great ideas unless they
        can make their respective party look good for suggesting
        something and the other party look bad for opposing it. </p>
        <p>When is the last time that you saw House Speaker Newt
        Gingrich and Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt at a
        press conference saying they both backed a major new
        initiative and that neither party was going to claim
        credit for thinking of it? It doesn't happen. </p>
        <p>Wamp, a Chattanooga Republican, is one of only about a
        dozen House members who refuse political donations from
        interest groups, also known as political action
        committees or PACs. Another is Van Hilleary, a Spring
        City Republican. </p>
        <p>So, it makes sense that Wamp would favor campaign
        finance reform. </p>
        <p>Wamp's idea is simple. He wants the House leaders from
        both parties to name a bipartisan panel with an equal
        number of House members from each party and give them
        three months to produce a campaign finance reform package
        with attractive elements for both parties. </p>
        <p>He figures that an outside commission would not be
        plugged in well enough to draft something that Congress
        could pass. </p>
        <p>Well, Wamp suggested his idea Nov. 25 in letters to
        House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, and to
        Democratic leader Richard Gephardt. Neither leader has
        responded to date. </p>
        <p>Party leaders now have other matters on their minds.
        Democrats are trying to make Gingrich look as bad as
        possible over his ethics case and his Dec. 21 admission
        of providing false information to the House Ethics
        Committee and to seek as severe a punishment as they can
        get. Democrats also are hoping the whole ordeal takes
        more of the shine off all Republican candidates in
        voters' minds. </p>
        <p>Republicans are gearing up for another year of Clinton
        bashing. They are planning hearings and endless
        discussions over whether the Democratic National
        Committee and the Clinton-Gore campaign broke laws in
        receiving donations from foreign individuals and
        companies last year. Also, both parties will be accusing
        the other of terrible proposals for the 1998 budget
        cycle. </p>
        <p>A big difficulty in campaign finance reform is that
        many Republicans don't want to ban campaign donations
        from business interests which give generously to them.
        Many Democrats don't want to cut off the labor groups'
        donations that go primarily to their candidates. </p>
        <p>Many Democrats like the idea of public financing of
        congressional races in a fashion similar to the matching
        funds given presidential primary candidates. Most
        Republicans oppose public funds in congressional races. </p>
        <p>Wamp is hoping that the pressure of a deadline would
        prompt a task force to come up with a workable plan. He
        favors ending interest groups' donations to campaigns but
        realizes that ban could be found unconstitutional by the
        courts. So, he is proposing a way to neutralize part of
        the influence of PACs. </p>
        <p>He proposes to lower what a PAC may donate per
        candidate from the current $5,000 per election to $2,000.
        Then he would raise what individuals may give from the
        current $1,000 to $2,000 per candidate per election. </p>
        <p>Also, Wamp would force candidates to go home for more
        fund raising, requiring that a majority of total funds
        come from individuals living in the candidate's home
        state. </p>

        thing and clean up campaign fund raising. He promises to

        <p><br>
        <font size="5">S</font>tate government's revolving door
        has been spinning rapidly for a long time now and is
        unlikely to stop anytime soon, despite such occasional
        efforts by reformer types. </p>
        <p>The primary reasons are simple: (1) Too many people of
        power and influence don't like the idea of blocking
        government policy-makers from future profit-making, (2)
        the only people who pay much attention to the matter are
        -- for the most part -- people of power and influence and
        (3) reformers never seem to get their act together. </p>
        <p>All elements were illustrated by the lay of the
        landscape last week when the leaders of Tennessee Citizen
        Action and Common Cause were calling for an
        anti-revolving door law. The idea is to forbid government
        officials from leaving their public posts and taking jobs
        that involve influencing government officials -- at least
        for a year or so after leaving office. </p>
        <p>Gov. Don Sundquist's cabinet provides a fine example
        of the revolving-door phenomenon, which is in keeping
        with a tradition observed by those who held power under
        governors past. </p>
        <p>A case study could be Nancy Menke, who cut her teeth
        in governmental doings as a lobbyist for the Tennessee
        State Employees Association. Now she can be found
        standing beside the governor as he criticizes TSEA for a
        reputation of unreasonableness in its demands for pay
        increases. </p>
        <p>The latest spin of the revolving door has left Menke
        as commissioner of the new Department of Public Health,
        salaried at $120,000 per year. (She is smart and savvy
        enough to doubtless earn more than that elsewhere.) </p>
        <p>Since her TSEA days in the 1980s, she has revolved
        into a private sector contract lobbyist for folks such as
        Corrections Corporation of America, then into a job as
        the governor's lobbyist, then into a job as a key
        governor policy adviser on issues including prisons, then
        back to the private lobbying format, then back to take
        the commissioner's job. </p>
        <p>The governor's new legal counsel, Courtney Pearre, is
        a former lobbyist and, in all likelihood, will lobby
        again. Ditto for Hardy Mays, who Pearre replaced as legal
        counsel and who is now deputy to the governor and chief
        of staff. </p>
        <p>Ditto again for Peaches Simpkins, who has served as
        private sector lobbyist when not holding government
        positions under governors Ned McWherter, Lamar Alexander
        or Ray Blanton -- and who is now in the private sector. </p>
        <p>Legislators revolve, too. Probably at least a third of
        the current corps of lobbyists working the Legislature
        are former legislators. Probably a lot of current
        legislators want to become lobbyists someday and make
        more than the $16,500 per year that we taxpayers give
        them. </p>
        <p>Less frequently, former lobbyists also revolve through
        the door to become legislators. For example, freshman
        state Rep. Gene Caldwell, D-Oak Ridge, campaigned as a
        man experienced in government because of his lobbying on
        behalf of causes he supported as a pediatrician. </p>
        <p>Some lobbyists duly noted last week that Brian
        McGuire, director of Tennessee Citizen Action, tried to
        revolve from lobbyist to legislator during the 1996
        campaign and joked that he ''got stuck in the revolving
        door.'' </p>
        <p>(McGuire lost in the Democratic primary last August to
        state Rep. Bill Boner, D-Nashville, who -- in some
        remarkable intragovernment revolving -- has moved from
        the state House to the U.S. Congress, to Nashville mayor
        and back to the state House.) </p>
        <p>While folks of power and influence enjoy the
        revolving-door ride, the opposition has long seemed
        simply dizzy. Anti-revolving-door bills have surfaced in
        past legislative sessions but always have spun off into
        oblivion. </p>
        <p>What is needed, of course, is a good lobbyist to work
        things out and get an anti-revolving door bill passed.
        Trouble is, nobody seems willing to hire him or her and
        pay the bill. </p>
        <p>OOPS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: In this space last week, it was
        wrongly indicated that Gov. Sundquist's commissioners had
        recently responded to a survey soundly trashing their
        boss' idea for putting all department lawyers into a
        central pool. Not so, advises Sundquist press spokeswoman
        Beth Fortune. The survey was taken back in 1995, when it
        was simply being studied by the Sundquist-appointed
        Commission on Practical Government. </p>

        wrongly indicated that Gov. Sundquist's commissioners had
        recently responded to a survey soundly trashing their
        boss' idea for putting all department lawyers into a
        central pool. Not so, advises Sundquist press spokeswoman
        Beth Fortune. The survey was taken back in 1995, when it
        was simply being studied by the Sundquist-appointed
        Commission on Practical Government. </p>

        <font size="5">C</font>ocke County resident Gay Webb, who
        has been involved in trying to clean up the Pigeon River
        as long as anybody, once brought the whole issue home to
        me with a simple tale about raindrops. </p>
        <p>There is a ridge high up in the Smokies where, when
        the raindrops fall, they course down each side of the
        mountain. </p>
        <p>The drops on one side of the ridge tumble off down
        various cataracts to form the Little Pigeon River, which
        flows through Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge and Sevierville.
        It is a scenic adjunct to one of the most vibrant
        economies in Tennessee, a tourism industry that rivals
        any manufacturing operation in its impact on a state
        economy driven by sales tax revenue. </p>
        <p>There were some families along that river named Maples
        and Reagan and Ogle, among others, who have lived well
        and prospered and who in turn made a lot of other Sevier
        County people well off and prosperous. </p>
        <p>Raindrops on the other side of the ridge also tumble
        off the mountain in a stream, flowing into the Pigeon
        River. The Pigeon flows through Hartford and Newport in
        Cocke County. Unfortunately, before it gets there, the
        Pigeon flows by the Champion International paper mill in
        Canton, N.C., where it picks up brown to black effluent
        that the Environmental Protection Agency ruled last week
        can continue unabated. </p>
        <p>I can't give you the names of any entrepreneurs on the
        Pigeon River who have built hotels or amusement parks,
        although the News-Sentinel did run a list a few years
        ago, provided by Hartford residents, of 167 people there
        who died of cancer. </p>
        <p>Cocke County also nestles in the foothills of the
        Smokies. It even had an interstate running through it
        when the main route to Gatlinburg still included driving
        through downtown Knoxville and out Chapman Highway. </p>
        <p>Cocke and Sevier counties are roughly the same size.
        The interstate highway system came to East Tennessee
        about two decades ago and boosted a mountain resort area
        into a tourism industry. The populations of the two
        counties were fairly close in 1970, with 25,283 people in
        Cocke County and 28,241 people in Sevier County. </p>
        <p>But, after two decades, what are the differences
        between Cocke and Sevier counties now? </p>
        <p>According to the East Tennessee Development District
        annual report: </p>
        <p>* The population of Sevier County is now more than
        58,000, an increase of over 100percent since 1970. The
        population of Cocke County has increased to 29,000.
        That's 15percent growth, less than 1percent per year. </p>
        <p>* Yearly sales tax generated, Sevier County,
        $81million. Cocke County, $12million. </p>
        <p>* Retail sales, yearly, Sevier County, $819million.
        Cocke County, $171million. </p>
        <p>* Receipts from hotel and motel taxes, Sevier County,
        $212million. Cocke County, $5million. </p>
        <p>I think you get the picture. </p>
        <p>We have two counties starting out with the same
        population and resources over the past 25 years. Sevier
        County capitalized on its location and scenic beauty to
        become an economic powerhouse. </p>
        <p>Cocke County did not. </p>
        <p>Can I argue that having Cocke County's principal river
        polluted, which flows alongside the park, the interstate
        and by its county seat, made the difference? </p>
        <p>Would you argue that the people in two neighboring
        counties are so different that one county can produce a
        rash of entrepreneurs who set off an economic explosion
        while the people in the neighboring county languish below
        the state average in every category? </p>
        <p>I don't believe that. </p>
        <p>A three-county group of elected and tourism officials
        met this week to organize in an effort to clean up the
        Pigeon River. It ought to be cleaned up because it's the
        right thing to do. It ought to be cleaned up because a
        beautiful mountain stream should not be turned black and
        smell bad because a company just doesn't want to spend
        the money to clean it up. </p>
        <p>But if you don't care about the environment, consider
        the economics of the situation. </p>
        <p>Suppose Cocke County, which could offer whitewater
        rafting, hiking, backpacking and hotels along the Pigeon
        with interstate access, came to be a thriving supplement
        to the tourism in Sevier? Suppose the state and the
        region had the additional sales taxes and lodging taxes
        and retail sales of another Sevier County? </p>
        <p>Can you see why tourism officials and elected
        officials and business people of all sorts ought to get
        behind cleaning up the river? </p>
        <p>I recently wrote that with one phone call Vice
        President Al Gore could have the EPA clean up the river.
        The EPA has since issued Champion a permit to continue
        polluting the river with no date stated on when any
        further clean-up efforts will occur. Gore now says he has
        asked the EPA to review its decision, since he is being
        blistered on the Internet on every environmental and
        outdoor recreation web page in America. </p>
        <p>Gov. Don Sundquist, meanwhile, has asked the attorney
        general to prepare a lawsuit against the EPA to make the
        agency do its job. </p>
        <p>I think we are getting an indication that the EPA's
        Atlanta office will live to regret its action. Being
        hammered between a vice president with his environmental
        credentials on the line and a governor who needs East
        Tennessee votes badly in 1998 could turn out to be as
        good an example as any of being between a rock and a hard
        place. </p>

        <font size="5">Y</font>ou may have read or heard about
        West Tennessee Judge David Lanier. He sexually harassed
        women who worked for him, and he extorted sex from women
        who had child custody cases before his court. </p>
        <p>The FBI found as many as 50 women that the judge had
        harassed in some fashion. The most egregious cases were
        women forced to have sex with him in his office while he
        told them things like, ''You'll never see your child
        again if you don't do what I say.'' </p>
        <p>He was convicted in federal court on several charges
        of sexual assault (I liked it better when the legal
        system called it what it is -- rape) and was sentenced to
        25 years in prison. </p>
        <p>Charges against Lanier had to be brought by the FBI
        and he had to be tried in federal court because Lanier
        was a powerful political figure in Dyersburg and because
        his brother was the district attorney general. </p>
        <p>Those two circumstances also allowed him to prey on
        women for years before he was brought to justice. </p>
        <p>The U.S. Sixth Circuit, the federal appeals court in
        Cincinnati, reversed Lanier's conviction, saying sexual
        assault is a state crime and the federal statute used to
        convict Lanier does not apply to sexual harassment. The
        case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court. </p>
        <p>There now exists the danger that protection of women
        from sexual assault nationwide will be weakened and
        Lanier will not spend the 25 years in prison that he so
        richly deserves. </p>
        <p>This is another example of the defects in Tennessee's
        justice system. </p>
        <p>In almost any other state the women who had no
        recourse in the local legal system could have gone to the
        state attorney general's office. </p>
        <p>An elected state attorney general with the power to
        bring criminal charges in public corruption cases could
        have impanelled a grand jury and prosecuted Lanier on the
        proper charge -- the state statutes governing rape. </p>
        <p>There would have been no constitutional question to be
        settled -- the sleaze bag would be in prison for his
        25-year term. </p>
        <p>This is just the latest example, of course. Think of
        all the public corruption cases in Tennessee in the past
        20 years that had to be brought by a U.S. attorney in
        federal court. There have been almost 15 sheriffs
        convicted of corruption -- none of them in state courts
        and none of them charged by local district attorneys. </p>
        <p>The official we call the state attorney general is
        appointed by the Supreme Court. The office would more
        properly be called a solicitor general. An attorney
        general should be an independent officeholder with the
        power to call for TBI investigations, the power to
        impanel a grand jury and the power to root out and
        prosecute public corruption wherever it exists. </p>
        <p>But our Legislature evidently believes that there is
        no public corruption in Nashville or in any of our 95
        courthouses. (I guess they didn't hear about Lanier.)
        Citizens in Tennessee who are oppressed by local
        officialdom have only one recourse -- try and get federal
        intervention. </p>
        <p>It does violence to our federal form of government to
        use federal authority to prosecute state crimes. </p>
        <p>The FBI and U.S. attorneys across the nation are
        preoccupied these days (perhaps rightly) with prosecuting
        drug dealers. One suspects that the lack of public
        corruption cases brought in federal court recently does
        not mean a sudden upsurge in probity among elected
        officials. </p>
        <p>There seems to be a fear that an elected attorney
        general would be political. If that means being
        responsive to voters, what's wrong with that? Are we
        afraid an elected attorney general would prosecute
        sleaze-bag judges or prosecute consumer fraud just to be
        popular and run for governor? </p>
        <p>So, what's the down side? </p>
        <p>In most states, voters get a chance to see people in
        statewide office perform before they are asked to elect
        them governor. In Tennessee, it's always a crap shoot. We
        don't have any statewide offices except governor. </p>
        <p>And if electing an attorney general is such a bad
        thing, then why are the attorneys general in every
        judicial district elected? </p>
        <p>There may be an underlying cause of all the Nashville
        wailing about keeping politics out of the attorney
        general's office. </p>
        <p>The Nashville crowd likes to bash the Tennessee
        Conservative Union for refusing to disclose its donor
        list, and it thus incurs fines from the Registry of
        Election Finance -- fines which the TCU then ignores. </p>
        <p>I suspect that one of the things that makes them so
        angry is that the TCU has demonstrated to everyone what a
        farce most legislative reforms really are. </p>
        <p>The Legislature likes to talk about ethics laws and
        campaign disclosure statements and lobbyist registrations
        and other high sounding reforms they have enacted. And
        they are certainly better than nothing. But what no one
        likes to talk about is two aspects all these reforms have
        in common. </p>
        <p>1. There are no criminal penalties for violating any
        of them. </p>
        <p>2. If there were, there is no one to prosecute anyone
        for violating them. </p>
        <p>At present the Registry can levy fines, but the law is
        so full of holes the fines cannot be collected if the
        group refuses to play along. </p>
        <p>There may be an effort to reform some of these laws
        this session, and a lot of people will be talking about
        getting tough on scofflaws. </p>
        <p>But in all these discussions about ethics reform and
        campaign finance reform and disclosure statements, you
        should always keep one thing in mind. It doesn't do you
        any good to have laws if violating them is not a crime
        and if you don't have anyone to enforce them. </p>

        <font size="5">W</font>ould you rather your tax money be
        spent on: </p>
        <p>A. Providing more jobs in Oak Ridge. </p>
        <p>B. Cleaning up the environment in Oak Ridge to make
        more land and facilities available to create more jobs. </p>
        <p>C. More government paper work. </p>
        <p>D. Meetings where bureaucrats talk for weeks and
        months. </p>
        <p>E. Plane fare for bureaucrats to fly back and forth to
        Washington. </p>
        <p>I kind of like A and B, and I think the less we have
        of C, D and E, the better. If you agree, then you should
        hope that the new secretary of energy also agrees. </p>
        <p>And somebody from the Knoxville-Oak Ridge metro area
        ought to convince him. </p>
        <p>There used to be one giant contract in Oak Ridge to
        handle production facilities and the Oak Ridge National
        Laboratory, and it included environmental cleanup. Then
        the Department of Energy started to break the contract up
        into pieces. Lockheed Martin has had the contract for the
        past 12 years. </p>
        <p>There has been a feeling lately that some
        environmental cleanup in Oak Ridge is actually being done
        at long last, and there is less talk, paperwork,
        contract-letting and fewer meetings. To start the
        paperwork over again seems to be counterproductive. </p>
        <p>DOE extended Lockheed Martin's contract for production
        facilities and the lab for two years. But a contract for
        environmental cleanup has been broken out separately and
        is being put up for bid. </p>
        <p>Secretary Hazel O'Leary probably thought one of the
        contracts ought to be thrown out as a bone to contractors
        since 1996 was an election year. </p>
        <p>So the department is about to ask if anybody wants to
        bid on the contract; they have asked for proposals on
        what should be in the contract, they will ask for bids on
        the contract and then let the contract. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Federico Pena is the new DOE secretary, and
        it will certainly take him a while to get up to speed on
        everything going on within the department and at all the
        federal facilities. Is anything likely to happen right
        away? </p>
        <p>At the rate the process is going, it could be two
        years before DOE gets around to even awarding a new
        contract. </p>
        <p>If another company gets the contract, there will be
        the inevitable delays as that company: A. Studies the
        waste sites. B. Reviews what's been done. C. Finds things
        to blame on the previous contractor. D. Has community
        meetings. E. Announces goals. F. Finds subcontractors. G.
        Meets with the state. H. Meets with Oak Ridge. I. Meets
        with DOE. Then maybe, after six months to a year,
        cleaning up the waste starts again. </p>
        <p>If Lockheed Martin is doing such a good job that the
        other two contracts were extended, then why not let them
        keep the environmental cleanup contract as well? </p>
        <p>That keeps the focus on cleanup instead of on more
        paperwork. </p>
        <p>The government contracting process is a time-consuming
        complicated mess that ought to be avoided at all costs.
        It would seem to be something that could be avoided in
        this case. </p>
        <p>There are other considerations as well. </p>
        <p>If there is one thing Oak Ridge needs right now, it is
        allies in Washington. As the federal role in Oak Ridge
        diminishes, it will be dicey to transition into private
        jobs without some tremendous dislocations. </p>
        <p>Lockheed Martin is a major government contractor at
        the Pentagon and at government facilities around the
        country. </p>
        <p>In other words, they have clout on Capitol Hill. </p>
        <p>That is the advantage in having one big company manage
        all the contracts in Oak Ridge. </p>
        <p>And if the environmental portion of the contract were
        extended to end the same time as the other two, it makes
        it more likely that Lockheed Martin would bid on all
        three. That keeps a company in place that has ties to the
        community and which has employees who are rooted in the
        community. </p>
        <p>I find these arguments persuasive, but I'm sure some
        other people may have a different opinion. </p>
        <p>I think it is an important issue for two reasons. </p>
        <p>Firstly, whether the contract is extended or not can
        be debated, but, since it is a major component of the
        local economy, it ought to be something of which local
        business and political leaders are at least aware. I
        would guess that some of them haven't a clue. </p>
        <p>Secondly, it points up the problem in having a dozen
        so-called industrial and business development agencies
        running around. There is no clearinghouse that sets
        priorities for the local economy. </p>
        <p>There ought to be one high-level group somewhere with
        the staff to keep tabs on the local economy and then sell
        the public, Congress and DOE on what ought to be done. </p>
        <p>It certainly isn't anything to be left to drift along.

39% </h2>
<p><em>By Frank Cagle, News-Sentinel Managing Editor</em></p>
<p>Sometimes it is as bad as you thought it would be.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's worse.</p>
<p>The capital budget for state parks in the last five McWherter administration 
budgets looked like this:</p>
<p>West Tennessee: 41 percent.</p>
<p>Middle Tennessee: 46 percent.</p>
<p>East Tennessee: 13 percent.</p>
<p>That's right. For five years you sent 40 percent of the money to fund state 
parks to Nashville, and you got back 13 percent of it.</p>
<p>You were contributing 27 percent of the portion of your taxes for state 
parks to Middle and West Tennessee.</p>
<p>I am indebted to the Friends of Norris Dam State Park for this analysis of 
state parks budget numbers. This group has been trying to get some 
improvements at Norris, and they took a look at where the state parks 
money has been spent.</p>
<p>I talked with a remarkably candid high official of the state parks department 
who told me that the numbers are not quite accurate. He points out that the 
budgets include money appropriated for an East Tennessee golf course that 
was never built.</p>
<p>So the amount of money actually spent on capital projects is less than 13 
percent.</p>
<p>Then there is the amount of money spent on capital maintenance. That figure 
for East Tennessee is 11 percent.</p>
<p>Well, I guess it stands to reason, doesn't it? If you don't build anything in 
East Tennessee, it costs less to maintain things.</p>
<p>The Friends wanted some improvements to the Norris park that included 
building a picnic shelter. The only one there was built by the CCC boys in 
the 1930s. While they were building golf courses all over West Tennessee, 
Norris couldn't get a lousy picnic shelter.</p>
<p>What a difference a Republican governor makes.</p>
<p>This year the Sundquist administration put in the money, requested by state 
Rep. Don Coffey and Sen. Randy McNally, to build a shelter at Norris. 
(The first year Sundquist came in, the McWherter budget was already in 
place, and little change could be accomplished.)</p>
<p>Back to that state park official. He points out that the Sundquist 
administration is distributing almost $5 million in grants from the recreation 
fund.</p>
<p>Under Gov. Don Sundquist, the grants were distributed this way:</p>
<p>West Tennessee: 28 percent.</p>
<p>Middle Tennessee: 33 percent.</p>
<p>East Tennessee: 39 percent.</p>
<p>In other words, the funds were distributed fairly, based on population figures 
for the three grand divisions.</p>
<p>(The fairness is also being extended to highway department funds, as 
Sundquist noted in Knoxville last week when he dedicated a new $15 million 
highway department facility here. He also noted that it costs more to build a 
mile of highway in hilly East Tennessee than it does in other parts of the 
state.)</p>
<p>Sundquist has a lot of friends and supporters in East Tennessee, and he 
wants to do the right thing. But he also knows he did not, and can not, get 
elected without East Tennessee's Republican voters.</p>
<p>The state park at Norris is typical of all state parks in East Tennessee: There 
isn't enough money for basic maintenance, much less for additions. The 
Friends group notes in a report to its legislative delegation that the swimming 
pool leaks, the grist mill needs a major overhaul, the museum has not been 
carpeted nor the walls painted in 20 years, and the heat/air system breaks 
down routinely.</p>
<p>Sen. Bud Gilbert, R-Knoxville, was one of the legislators getting a law 
passed last session that requires the parks department to devote at least 6 
percent of its budget to maintenance. The state has a sorry history of 
announcing projects and building things and then not properly maintaining 
them. No one has a press conference to announce that they got an 
appropriation to cut the grass or plug the leaks in a state parks' swimming 
pool.</p>
<p>Gilbert says, unfortunately, that a budget shortfall may make it impossible for 
the maintenance funds to be available this year.</p>
<p>The Sundquist administration is trying its best to build a golf course in East 
Tennessee if a proper site can be found. It has to be on existing state land, 
since there is no money for purchasing any additional land.</p>
<p>I don't care if the state ever builds another golf course, but if they do, it had 
better be in East Tennessee.</p>
<p>The next time a West Tennessee Democrat comes over here asking for your 
vote, just remember the magic combination: 41-46-13.</p>

HORROR OF IT ALL </h2>
<p><em>By Frank Cagle, News-Sentinel Managing Editor</em></p>
<p>I don't think I have ever heard more pious, hand-wringing flapdoodle in my 
life as I have since Justice Penny White was turned out of office by the 
voters.</p>
<p>The suggestion that politics played a role in the selection (or nonselection) of 
a judge is usually delivered with the surprised and disbelieving air of 
someone who has just heard that the Campbellites have put a poker machine 
in the church's basement.</p>
<p>Let us review a little history, shall we?</p>
<p>Before Justice White, there was Justice Charles O'Brien. Justice O'Brien 
was appointed to the court by Gov. Ned McWherter in 1987. He was then 
ratified by the state Democratic Executive Committee and placed on the 
ballot unopposed in 1988 and again in 1990 for a term extending through 
1998. Justice O'Brien was a nice fellow, and he did a good job agreeing 
with Justices Frank Drowota and Riley Anderson and preventing their 
colleagues from rewriting the state Constitution.</p>
<p>But let's be realistic here. Was he put on the court because he had the finest 
legal mind available or because he was the husband of state Sen. Anna Belle 
Clement O'Brien?</p>
<p>Miss Anna Belle. Patronage queen for the Clement machine. Scourge of the 
Republican Party. Candidate recruiter. The kind of woman political enemies 
flatter with a nickname that can't be printed in a family newspaper. (If the 
Republicans had a couple Miss Anna Belles, they wouldn't be a minority 
party.)</p>
<p>And I suppose it was just a coincidence that Gov. Ned McWherter told 
Charlie O'Brien to retire four years early in time for McWherter to appoint 
Justice White. Otherwise, if O'Brien retired a couple of years later, 
in-coming Republican Gov. Don Sundquist would have made the 
appointment.</p>
<p>So McWherter appointed White on the recommendation of, among others, 
Houston Gordon, Democrat candidate for the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>So, gosh darn it. Considering how she got there, I don't think I am quite as 
surprised as some of the other commentators are that politics also reared its 
head when White left office.</p>
<p>There is also a lot of talk about White being ousted because of attacks by a 
fringe group.</p>
<p>This is a reference to the Tennessee Conservative Union.</p>
<p>Hmmm. A fringe group.</p>
<p>The TCU argued that Ronald Reagan would be a better president than 
Howard Baker, and America agreed.</p>
<p>The TCU opposed a state income tax while all ``the best people'' were 
pushing it as tax reform. Who did the people of Tennessee agree with?</p>
<p>The TCU said Penny White shouldn't be retained as a Supreme Court 
justice, and 55percent of the state'e electorate agreed.</p>
<p>Maybe the state's newspaper columnists and talk show pundits ought to stop 
and think long and hard about who is on the fringe and who is in the 
mainstream.</p>
<p>And the TCU arguments against White were identical to the state 
Republican Party, Gov. Don Sundquist, Sen. Bill Frist and Sen. Fred 
Thompson. The party did mail-outs, and the three senior state Republicans 
voted against her and then announced it to the voters.</p>
<p>I don't always agree with the TCU. I have criticized its leadership in the past, 
including accusing them of being a front group for the Democrats to attack 
Republicans.</p>
<p>But the TCU, which has been a force in state politics for over 15 years, is 
closer to the values and political outlook of more Tennesseans than most of 
the state's leaders would like to admit.</p>
<p>But that's why certain people want to take the election of judges away from 
the people.</p>
<p>The elite in Nashville are scared silly of the people. They want judges to be 
picked by, in their view, the only people qualified to do so: other lawyers.</p>
<p>Excuse me. Make that Democrat lawyers.</p>
<p>The present members of the state Supreme Court ran in statewide elections. 
Have they ever been intimidated? The real issue is that Republicans have 
been winning statewide office with some regularity lately. As in the 
governorship and both U.S. Senate seats.</p>
<p>So the Democrats changed the law.</p>
<p>All future Supreme Court justices will be named by a special commission, 
appointed by (surprise!) Senate Speaker John Wilder and House Speaker 
Jimmy Naifeh.</p>
<p>The present commission has 15 members, though half of them have terms 
that expire at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Three are from East Tennessee.</p>
<p>Six are from Middle Tennessee.</p>
<p>Six are from West Tennessee.</p>
<p>(I think I'm beginning to see a pattern here.)</p>
<p>None is appointed by the governor. None is from Knoxville, home of the 
University of Tennessee School of Law, half the lawyers in East Tennessee, 
the U.S. attorney's office and most of East Tennessee's federal courts.</p>
<p>But I guess they don't think there is enough legal talent here to justify having 
a judge recruiter.</p>
<p>After all, if you fit their qualifications, you'd already be a buddy of Wilder or 
Naifeh.</p>
<p>Are statewide elections looking better now?</p>

SAINTS </h2>
<p><em>By Frank Cagle, News-Sentinel managing editor</em></p>
<p>Perhaps when they start appointing the governor, people will pay attention.</p>
<p>* House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh and Senate Speaker John Wilder appoint 
two out of three of the people who regulate state utilities.</p>
<p>* They appoint a commission that picks state Supreme Court justices.</p>
<p>* The justices, in turn, hire the state attorney general.</p>
<p>* Naifeh picks the secretary of state, the repository of all state records and 
laws; the state comptroller, who controls all the state auditors; and the state 
treasurer, who controls all the money, including state pension funds. Now, 
technically, the three constitutional officers are elected by the General 
Assembly in joint session. In practice, the House outnumbers the Senate 99 
to 39, and the House does the electing. And, thanks to the Democrat unit 
rule, the House does what the speaker tells it to do.</p>
<p>The secretary of state's office also controls the state Registry of Election 
Finance, which regulates political contributions and lobbyists. The office also 
contains the state election commission, which controls the election 
machinery.</p>
<p>So, let's recap.</p>
<p>Auditors, justices of the Supreme Court, the attorney general, state 
regulators and the election machinery all owe their jobs to either Naifeh or to 
Naifeh and Wilder acting in concert.</p>
<p>Gee. It's a good thing Naifeh and Wilder are virtual saints. My point, 
however, is that these paragons of virtue won't be around forever. What 
would happen if, God forbid, a person with less integrity assumed one of 
these positions?</p>
<p>Imagine what could happen if Tennessee were like other states, where there 
might occur occasional corruption. (Does anyone remember Ray Blanton?)</p>
<p>What safeguards are in place to maintain the integrity of state government? 
Where is an independent voice to blow the whistle, launch an investigation or 
prosecute a felon?</p>
<p>Where are the checks and balances?</p>
<p>This is just another example of the interlocking directorate that runs this 
state. In order for any particular special interest group to have its way with 
the public, it requires them to have a special relationship with just one, or 
possibly two, elected officials.</p>
<p>We allegedly live in a democracy where the people elect their government. 
The only state official you can elect, statewide, is the governor.</p>
<p>Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe has argued for 25 years that the state attorney 
general should be elected as in every judicial district throughout the state. It 
is also an elected office in 42 of the 50 states of these United States. This 
has become even more crucial in Tennessee since, within the past two years, 
the Public Service Commission has been removed from elections, as have all 
future Supreme Court justices.</p>
<p>But even more important is the problem that the state attorney general, the 
alleged chief legal officer of the state, has less power than a district attorney 
general. And without the elected political base the people give him, the state 
attorney general is merely a state employee subject to political pressure.</p>
<p>* There is no one in state government who can impanel a grand jury, bring 
an indictment or launch an investigation of state government corruption. (The 
TBI? Surely, you jest.)</p>
<p>* There is no one who dares audit or raise questions about consulting 
contracts passed out to friends and political supporters. (If, indeed, such a 
dastardly thing were ever to be done.)</p>
<p>* There is no one with the political independence to investigate improper 
acts by lobbyists. The News-Sentinel reported a couple of years ago that 
lobbyists' state disclosure forms revealed spending $14,000 to feed and 
entertain lawmakers. The same year, the lobbyists reported to the IRS 
spending an estimated $500,000. Who could examine this discrepancy? 
Who will bring them to task? The state comptroller who works for the 
legislators? The appointed and impotent attorney general?</p>
<p>This process would smell regardless of which political party controlled the 
machinery. In the case of Wilder and Naifeh, they have a House and Senate 
district that overlap, creating a situation where two men elected by several 
little rural counties in West Tennessee run almost every aspect of state 
government and appoint all the officials who allegedly have the responsibility 
to govern.</p>
<p>Is this what you want? Is this good?</p>
<p>Most of the power that has been taken by these two men has been usurped 
within the past two decades. It was not always thus, and it was not ever 
intended to be that way. It began when Ned McWherter was the speaker. 
But once a clique gets absolute power over the state House of 
Representatives, it can proceed to do any damn thing it pleases.</p>
<p>If you doubt the power of these individuals, ask yourself this: Have you ever 
heard anyone in a position of responsibility in Nashville make a stink about 
it?</p>
<p>Where will it stop?</p>
<p>When will they be satisfied?</p>
<p>Wilder must accommodate the governor and the Republicans because that is 
his power base. Naifeh has no such constraints.</p>
<p>I have been accused of being obsessed with Jimmy Naifeh. I wish a few 
more people in this state would get obsessed about him.</p>
<p>Or just mad enough to do something about it.</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>August 24, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>JENKINS WINS SEAT, BUT IS HE BOSS 
HOG? </h2>
<p><em>By Frank Cagle, News-Sentinel managing editor</em></p>
<p>Can Bill Jenkins deliver?</p>
<p>If he can, will he?</p>
<p>Being the congressman for the 1st District of Tennessee has always involved 
a bit more than serving in the U.S. House of Representatives. The heavily 
Republican 1st District has always been the launch pad for any statewide 
Republican candidacy, and the 1st District machine has been an integral part 
of state politics for the past 34 years under Congressman Jimmy Quillen.</p>
<p>The Boss Hog, if you will, of politics, patronage and pork.</p>
<p>Indeed, Quillen often had more patronage power in Nashville than he did in 
Washington. Republican governors and U.S. Senate candidates relied on 
Quillen's vaunted machine to deliver a big vote. (Critics would say some 
Democrats, like Jim Sasser and Ned McWherter, also relied on him, but I 
digress.)</p>
<p>Jenkins is under no obligation to continue the tradition of being the political 
organizer, patronage dispenser and vote deliverer -- the person who recruits 
Republican candidates and helps them get elected. It will be interesting to 
see if he takes on the job, or, if not, who will?</p>
<p>Gov. Don Sundquist has a one-seat Republican majority in the state Senate. 
This counterbalances the Democrats' iron-fisted control of the House. For 
Sundquist to be successful in the two years remaining before he faces 
re-election, he needs to retain control of the state Senate. The Democrats 
will pick up at least one seat this fall.</p>
<p>That brings us to the 4th District state Senate seat in East Tennessee. This 
district is six counties that include Union, Grainger, Jefferson, Claiborne, 
Hancock and Hawkins counties. It is traditionally Republican territory, but it 
is currently being held by first-term Democrat Sen. Danny Wallace of 
Maynardville. Sundquist needs for the Republicans to recapture this seat. 
The Republican candidate is state Rep. Mike Williams, also of Maynardville, 
who represents Union and Claiborne counties in the House.</p>
<p>To say it will be a tough campaign is to put it mildly. Wallace and Williams 
personally hate each other with a deep and abiding passion. Wallace and his 
father, J.D., run the old Butcher machine in Union County, and Williams is 
from the anti-Butcher Union County faction.</p>
<p>Although Williams is a tough campaigner and has the advantage of a lot of 
Republicans in the district, Wallace has the advantage of incumbency and a 
father who will spend whatever it takes to win.</p>
<p>The two candidates are probably about even in the lower end -- making 
Hawkins County the real key to victory. Hawkins County has the largest 
population of any other county in the district -- three times the population of 
Union County and almost twice as many people as Claiborne County.</p>
<p>Jenkins, who won the Republican primary for the 1st District congressional 
seat, is from Hawkins County. In the primary, he won 73 percent of the vote 
there against 10 other candidates.</p>
<p>(Yeah, I know Jenkins has a Democrat opponent in November. I also know 
that it is theoretically possible for a meteor to strike the Earth and kill us all. 
What does that have to do with real life?)</p>
<p>Can Jenkins translate that personal popularity to elect a Republican state 
senator? Will he make the effort?</p>
<p>The outcome of the race will foretell a great deal about the future of the 
Republican Party in East Tennessee and in the state.</p>
<p>The knock on Jenkins in some quarters is that he was a former speaker of 
the House and TVA board member and that he could have helped a lot of 
Republican candidates over the past 20 years but didn't. His friends point 
out that he was a circuit judge for most of the time since leaving the TVA 
board and that he couldn't get involved in partisan political races. He had to 
keep a low profile.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what he will do now that he is free of the judicial 
canons and is now the Republican standard bearer in the 1st District.</p>
<p>I would be very surprised if second- and third-place finishers former state 
Sen. Jim Holcomb and District Attorney General Al Schmutzer have 
completely ruled out coming back. They would be in a lot better shape to do 
so if Jenkins declines the leadership role in the 1st District.</p>
<p>But if the 1st District Congressman-elect and a Republican governor can't 
elect a Republican state senator from the Congressman-elect's home county, 
it does not bode well for the future.</p>
<p>One suspects that Jenkins and Sundquist would need to strap in for the 
1998 election year. It promises to be a bumpy ride.</p>

As I have often pointed out, there is a structural problem in state government which concentrates power within a small clique of politicians and special interest groups.<P>

   But I may have given you the impression over the past several months that this skunkworks was created by House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh. That is not true, and it isn't fair to the speaker. Naifeh isn't smart enough to have invented this grand scam.<P>

   No, it was set up by that evil genius Ned McWherter. It allowed McWherter to run things while he was speaker, and the machinery was there for him to use when he became governor.<P>

   But now, even with a Republican governor, the system remains very much in place. Naifeh might not have had the imagination to set it up, but McWherter did teach him how to run it.<P>

   The easiest way to explain it is to steal part of Sen. Bud Gilbert's explanation to civic groups about the difference between the rules of the House and the Senate.<P>

   Let's call it ``How a Bill Doesn't Become a Law,'' and it isn't anything you would want your child taught in civics class.<P>

   In the Senate, the rules determine which committee is assigned a legislator's bill, depending on the topic. It normally prevents games being played in assigning bills to inappropriate committees.<P>

   In the House, the speaker assigns bills to any committee he wants. If he doesn't like a bill he can send it to an unfriendly committee -- a business bill to a labor committee, for instance.<P>

   He also has the revenue and expenditures subcommittee, nicknamed the Black Hole. Any bill the speaker wants killed goes to the Black Hole committee, from which nothing, not even light, ever escapes.<P>

   In the Senate, a subcommittee cannot kill a bill. It recommends to the full committee that the bill be killed or passed, but the full committee still votes.<P>

   In the House, as few as three members of a subcommittee can kill a bill. In other words, three people can keep a committee or even the full House from considering a bill that the majority might want to pass. Or, more likely, a bill the public might force them to pass if it came to an up or down vote.<P>

   In the Senate, a bill cannot be killed without a recorded vote.<P>

   In the House, a subcommittee can kill a bill on a voice vote with no record kept. And the chair of the subcommittee decides who won the voice vote.<P>

   In the Senate, a bill goes to the Calendar Committee, which schedules it for a vote by the full Senate. This is a housekeeping function and the committee schedules the vote when the sponsor requests it. The Senate Calendar Committee cannot alter a bill and must schedule it for a vote.<P>

   That brings us to the House Calendar and Rules Committee. Every bill that gets voted on in the House has to go through this committee. That means the rest of the committees are a farce. Any lobbyist with influence with Naifeh can take care of any bill, introduced by anybody, while it is in this committee.<P>

   This committee is made up of the officers of all the other committees, who are Democrats who owe their positions to the speaker. The speaker appoints all the committee chairs. They are there at his discretion. It also inclues all the House officers, like the speaker, the pro tempore, the majority leader and the majority whip.<P>

   They do let three members of the minority party (read Republicans) onto the commitee.<P>

   The margin is, thus, 41 Democrats from the House leadership and three Republicans.<P>

   Well, why does it matter?<P>

   Unlike the Senate, the House Calendar and Rules Committee is not a housekeeping function. This committee can kill a bill, even though it has already been passed by the alleged appropriate committee. This committee can rewrite a bill, totally changing its meaning and intent.<P>

   This committee can take a bill and gut it, trash it, bury it, postpone it or use it to clean the capitol toilets. Of course, this doesn't happen too often because most bills are taken care of long before they ever get this far. Calendar and Rules is the last resort, in case there has been a slip-up.<P>

  The only thing that prevents the House rules from creating a total dictatorship by the speaker is that bills have to also pass the state Senate. Thus the speaker can use hand-picked subordinates to kill any bill he pleases in at least four different places without a House vote: unfriendly committee, Black Hole, subcommittee voice vote and (if something has slipped through the first three) Calendar and Rules. But he still must have the cooperation of the state Senate to pass a bill.<P>

   It has been suggested that the Senate, at least temporarily in the control of the Republicans, set up an identical Calendar Committee and play hardball with the speaker. But the non-confrontational state Senate has been reluctant to play such a sleazy game, even in self-defense.<P>

   Now do you understand how, even though we have a Republican governor and a Republican state Senate, East Tennessee will probably continue to get the shaft on appropriations?<P>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>I</font> know political stories get more confusing all the time, what with claims, 
counterclaims and spin doctors whirling out of control. </p>
<p>Let me see if I can give you any help with the political lexicon in use these 
days by political operatives and opinion-makers and frequently adopted by 
journalists. </p>
<p>You should understand that these are assumptions I have to make based on 
my exposure to political discourse and coverage. </p>
<p>* As best I can tell, a black minister who gets involved in politics is a 
community leader. A white minister who gets involved in politics is a fascist. </p>
<p>* If the Christian Coalition puts out a pamphlet that reveals that conservative 
candidates have views similar to its members and liberal candidates do not, it 
gets investigated by the Federal Election Commission because it is favoring 
one candidate over another. If the National Council of Churches or the 
Catholic Bishops put out a pamphlet revealing that the Democrat candidate's 
views and those of mainline churches are compatible, while the Republican 
candidate is hopelessly out of touch with moral issues, then that is a voter's 
guide. </p>
<p>* The word ''conservative'' is a code word for mean-spirited politicians who 
hate the poor. Conservatives are people who agree with the Democrats on 
social policy but just don't want to spend enough money. If they object to 
the very idea of a particular social program, they are what's known as ''ultra'' 
conservatives, or the dreaded ''arch'' conservatives. (As in: Shakespeare's 
Iago is an arch-villain.) </p>
<p>* You can use the term ''liberal'' in the abstract, but it cannot be attached to 
any candidate running for office. It can sometimes be used to describe 
historical Democrats, like Hubert Humphrey or George McGovern, and 
sometimes a Democrat with a safe seat -- like Ted Kennedy. There are, of 
course, no ''ultra'' liberals and certainly no ''arch'' liberals. </p>
<p>* No one can ever be called a ''socialist,'' even if he or she (like former 
Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel) is one. They are moderates, 
opposed by an ''arch conservative'' like Benjamin Netanyahu. </p>
<p>* Democrats in the state House of Representatives have something called 
the ''unit rule.'' This is a measure that ensures unity and that party members 
speak with one voice. Any Republican who urges his fellow party members 
to adopt a unit rule on an issue opposing the House leadership is partisan. 
Being partisan is the worst sin a Republican can commit in Nashville. 
Democrats are loyal, but never partisan. </p>
<p>* A statesman is an East Tennessee Republican who goes along with the 
House leadership. A statesman is someone who, in return, gets $100,000 
for his district. </p>
<p>* A partisan Republican is someone who whines about the millions being 
diverted from East Tennessee to West Tennessee going unnoticed, while the 
press release on the $100,000 gets the coverage. </p>
<p>* Any environmental group, even if formed last week by three political 
science students with a FAX machine, can be quoted by the media as an 
authority on old-growth forests, wood chip mills, nuclear energy, air 
pollution or global warming. A conservative group that speaks out on 
political issues should always be identified as ''a fringe group,'' which refuses 
to reveal its membership list. </p>
<p>* If there is no evidence or proof of a phenomenon, but it makes a good 
scare story, it is OK to write it, if you use one of the following phrases: 
''there is anecdotal evidence,'' or ''there are no hard data yet available, but.'' </p>
<p>You can also fall back on the old reliable fill-in-the-blank fear, as in 
''environmentalists fear,'' ''welfare recipients fear,'' ''opponents fear'' or the 
generic and all purpose unnamed ''experts fear.'' </p>
<p>* If high-principled statesmen decide to raise taxes it is just something that 
has to be done, and, while it may be a hardship, people will just have to find 
a way to pay it. If someone is irresponsible enough to propose a tax cut, 
however, the low-life vote-panderer has a duty to explain to the press how 
the government can afford to get by on less revenue. </p>
<p>* A targeted tax cut is good because the government has decided you can 
keep more of your money if you spend it on a good purpose. (The good 
purpose is defined by the government in the tax code, hence, ''targeted.'') A 
reduction in tax rates is bad, because it might benefit the rich. (Liberals have 
been unable, thus far, to figure out how to enact a tax cut without benefiting 
the people who pay taxes.) </p>
<p>I hope this explanation of current political jargon has been helpful. It is by no 
means comprehensive or final. </p>
<p>You may wonder how we have come to this point in our history where logic 
is turned on its head and imprecise language is the order of the day, but I 
would remind you that we are 12 years past 1984. </p>

				<FONT SIZE="-1"><!--dateline--></FONT></DIV></B><BR>
				<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>ell, what&#39;s new on the how-do-we-stick-it-to-East Tennessee front?
<P>   * As I explained in an earlier column, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency used to have three members from each Grand Division. Then a law was passed allowing the Speaker of the Senate (from West Tennessee) and the Speaker of the House (from West Tennessee) to each appoint an at-large member.
<P>   This accomplished two things: It allowed liquor lobbyist Tom Hensley to stay on the board when the law said he had to come off, and it allowed the speakers to appoint two people from West Tennessee (Hensley being one) as &#39;&#39;statewide representatives.&#39;&#39;
<P>   That means Middle and East Tennessee have three members each while West Tennessee has five members. And West Tennessee&#39;s Hensley is the most influential lobbyist in Nashville. He has run the TWRA since it was set up as a separate agency.
<P>   Our Outdoor writer, Bob Hodge, has reported that the budget committee of the TWRA killed several programs, one of which studies East Tennessee trout. After an outcry, the full TWRA voted to reinstate it, over the objections of Hensley.
<P>   What I found interesting about the controversy is that it revealed that the five-member budget committee, which holds the purse strings and initially killed the programs, consists entirely of the five members from West Tennessee.
<P>   How&#39;s that for a coincidence?
<P>   * Speaking of the TWRA, Sen. Bud Gilbert, R-Knoxville, as part of his work on the Fiscal Review Committee, had some research done on where the money goes for wetlands acquisitions. Since 1986 there has been a property transfer tax statewide to generate a fund for purchasing and preserving wetlands. This program was invented by Hensley, who is an avid Ducks Unlimited member. And most of the state&#39;s wetlands are in West Tennessee. But Hensley doesn&#39;t object to the tax being collected statewide.
<P>   No one objects to purchasing land to preserve wildlife, and Hensley is to be commended for his conservation efforts. But if it were to be spent just on preserving wilderness for wildlife, there would be a rationale for spending an equal amount in East Tennessee. Or, as Gilbert has suggested, on state parks. But it is earmarked for wetlands. (Read duck hunters.)
<P>   According to the best estimates the state can give Gilbert, Region 4, which is the Knoxville area north to Kentucky and everything east of there, a total of $8.6million in taxes have been collected since 1986. The TWRA has expended $2.3million on wetlands in Region 4.
<P>   That means TWRA planned to give us back 26percent of the taxes we paid to purchase wetlands.
<P>   Luckily, there was a legislative act which forced the TWRA to purchase the Royal Blue property, a huge tract of former coal and timber land in Campbell and Scott counties. That wildlife preserve, though not wetlands, was another $2.5million. So they wound up spending $4.8million in Region 4 out of the $8.6million collected.
<P>   So we have gotten back about 55percent of what we have paid in taxes for wetlands purchases.
<P>   * There is a vacancy on the state Supreme Court since the voters took a pass on retaining East Tennessee Justice Penny White. Attorney General Charles Burson has opined, however, that the replacement may come from East or from West Tennessee.
<P>   Hmmm. The Judicial Commission, appointed by the same two West Tennessee speakers, consists of 15 members. Three are from East Tennessee. Six are from Middle Tennessee. Six are from West Tennessee. None is from Knoxville.
<P>   The commission will screen applicants and send three names to Gov. Don Sundquist, who has said he wants to name a woman to the post.
<P>   So will the justice be from West or East?
<P>   It will be interesting to see what happens.
<P>   * I guess we ought to get around to predicting future ways in which we get to contribute more in taxes than we get back in services.
<P>   Get ready for Interstate69.
<P>   This is billed as the NAFTA highway from Indianapolis, Ind., to the Mexican border in South Texas. Since there are existing interstates from Indianapolis north, this link completes the trade route from Canada to Mexico through America&#39;s heartland.
<P>   I-69 goes through West Tennessee, from Kentucky to Memphis, then on across Arkansas to Texas.
<P>   The good thing about this project is that it will be built with mostly federal funds. Usually that means 90percent of the $10billion. (Though the feds don&#39;t have any money except what we send them in gasoline taxes. And Tennessee gets back less in highway funds than we pay in.) That leaves 10percent to be split among the states through which it passes, (Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Texas) and will very probably total $1billion.
<P>   So get ready for a big chunk of our state highway budget to get appropriated for this project. If it comes out of the West Tennessee Grand Division&#39;s portion of the budget, fine. But if it comes off the top, that means all three Grand Divisions will be funding it.
<P>   Any bets on how this one turns out?

<!--SUBHEAD--><p><font size=2><i>By Frank Cagle, News-Sentinel Managing Editor</i></font> </p>
<p><!--dateline--><br>
<font size=5>T</font>he dominant political party ideology in Tennessee is not Democrat or 
Republican. </p>
<p>It's conservative. </p>
<p>You can almost count the number of liberal officeholders in Tennessee on 
your fingers. Given the perceptions of Americans toward the national 
political parties, this has put the trend line in favor of the Republicans this 
decade. </p>
<p>In 1994 Tennessee went from having six Democrats in the U.S. House and 
three Republicans to having five Republicans and four Democrats; from 
having two Democrats in the U.S. Senate to having two Republicans in the 
U.S. Senate. </p>
<p>Party membership in the state seems to depend largely on geography and 
history, with a large number of swing voters in the middle. </p>
<p>At the state and local level, party membership and voting patterns are 
certainly more influenced by history than ideology. East Tennessee has been 
predominantly Republican since the Civil War. Middle and West Tennessee 
has been dominated by the Democrats for the same reason. Party control at 
the courthouse level is the hardest thing to change, and it is from such local 
organizations that legislators and statewide candidates emerge. </p>
<p>In the Tennessee Legislature, you will find very little ideological difference 
between a rural West Tennessee legislator and a rural East Tennessee 
legislator. </p>
<p>I have couched my criticisms of the General Assembly in terms of 
predominantly Republican East Tennessee being in the minority against the 
predominantly Democrat cast to the state House of Representatives. </p>
<p>This has nothing to do with ideology but much more to do with history, 
geography and party rules. </p>
<p>The irony, of course, is that state Rep. Wayne Ritchie, a two-term Knoxville 
Democrat, has been one of the leaders in trying to reform the rules of the 
House. By the same token, some of the worst bootlickers down there are 
some of the House Republicans. </p>
<p>Ritchie started off his service in the Legislature by refusing to sign the unit 
rule pledge. The unit rule binds Democrat House members to vote as a bloc. 
That means, if there are 50Democrats in the House, the leadership only 
needs 26 supporters to cast 50 votes. They have enough committee officers 
who owe their jobs to the speaker to give them a majority. Thus, the 
speaker has the votes in his pocket to pass or kill any bill. </p>
<p>In 1995 Ritchie and Rep. Ron Ramsey, R-Kingsport, attacked the ''killer 
subs.'' They raised enough of a stink for a rules change. It used to be that 
two members of a three-person subcommittee could kill a bill. The rules 
change raised the number of subcommittee members to five, so it took three 
members to constitute a majority. </p>
<p>Ritchie, who is angry about my constant bashing of the House leadership, 
says my contention in an earlier column that a subcommittee can kill a bill is 
wrong. The rules, as Ritchie got them rewritten, even state that a 
subcommittee cannot kill a bill. </p>
<p>If a subcommittee never votes on a bill, it is killed. </p>
<p>If the subcommittee does not pass a bill, the sponsor has to get a majority of 
the members on the full committee to vote to call it up for a vote. This 
loophole means that subcommittees do indeed kill bills, because if the 
speaker sends a bill to a subcommittee to have it killed there is no way the 
sponsor can get the full committee to buck that decision and revive it. </p>
<p>The only way to fix it so a subcommittee cannot kill a bill is a rule that every 
bill automatically goes to the full committee for a vote. </p>
<p>The present structure of state government is undemocratic (small d), 
concentrates too much power in the hands of too few people and allows 
major discrepancies in the disbursement of funds. </p>
<p>Given the growth of Republican populations in suburban Memphis and 
Nashville, and if present voting trends continue, it may be that the 
Republicans will eventually win control of the state House of 
Representatives. </p>
<p>Should that happen, and if there aren't structural changes in the makeup of 
state government, it won't be any more fair then than it is now. What's 
needed is a reform coalition that will do something about the concentrations 
of power in the hands of the few. </p>
<p>Too often a new crop of idealistic young legislators arrive already beholden 
to the special interest groups that financed their campaign or committed to 
vote the way their party tells them. By the time they learn the score, it is too 
late. </p>
<p>Perhaps this election there will be a large group of new independent-minded 
legislators. </p>
<p>Perhaps Gov. Don Sundquist will demonstrate he can deliver the House 
Republicans in a group. </p>
<p>Perhaps Ritchie can put together a bloc of progressive young legislators who 
can generate more reforms. </p>
<p>Perhaps the Black Caucus will be convinced that a good government 
coalition will benefit them more than backing West Tennessee rednecks. </p>
<p>Perhaps sanity will break out. </p>
<p>As comic Judy Tenuta might say: ''It COULD hapPEN.'' </p>

        <p>* I was listening to ''All Liberal Things Considered''
        the other day and heard the umpteenth report on the need
        for electric cars and how terrible it is that we depend
        on oil and gasoline to run our economy. </p>
        <p>As one interviewee put it, driving is wonderful, cars
        are terrible. </p>
        <p>I had the same thought I always have when I hear these
        stories about how electric cars are pollution free and we
        ought to switch to them from gasoline and solve our
        environmental problems: Where are you going to get the
        extra electricity, you idiots? </p>
        <p>Think about it. </p>
        <p>Everybody gets an electric car or two. Every night we
        plug them in to charge the batteries. Say you can get by
        with just doubling your current electricity usage. Where
        does TVA get double its current capacity? </p>
        <p>Strip mine some more coal, build some more coal-fired
        plants, dump some more sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere
        so we can avoid gasoline-powered cars? </p>
        <p>Do electric car proponents want to build some more
        nuke plants? </p>
        <p>Haven't you heard of the China Syndrome? Don't you
        know that Jane Fonda has proven that the uranium cores
        can melt down and go through the earth all the way to
        China? (Possibly endangering a TVA consultant or two.) </p>
        <p>I suppose we can put windmills on top of the cars and
        as we drive down the road we will generate electricity
        and have a perpetual motion machine. Yeah, that's the
        ticket. </p>
        <p>* Speaking of TVA, the agency reported last week that
        there is a rotting dock in disrepair an average of every
        22 miles up and down the river. </p>
        <p>How do they know? </p>
        <p>Oh, yeah. TVA Director Johnny Hayes spends a lot of
        time going up and down the river in that party barge.
        Maybe he counts them. </p>
        <p>* Sometimes arithmetic can be confusing. TVA says 600
        docks are in disrepair on 11,000 miles of shoreline. They
        also say there are 5.4 structures per mile or 60,000 lake
        structures. But the rationale for this relentless
        policing effort is that many lake dwellers have
        complained about pieces of docks and boathouses floating
        in the lakes and being a danger to boats. </p>
        <p>Have you ever run over a floating boathouse? </p>
        <p>I know I've run over a tree toppled into the river by
        a raging current from TVA blowing water through all four
        turbines at Cherokee Dam at the same time. </p>
        <p>* Sometimes arithmetic can be confusing, Part II. The
        Knox County school board proposes spending $8.8 million
        to build 24 new classrooms at Bearden High School. A
        careful reader points out that is $366,666 per classroom
        and asks me what kind of house (and how much square
        footage) can you build for $366,666? </p>
        <p>This is something of a Catch-22. In order to add on to
        old buildings and improve the situation for students, you
        have to bring the rest of the old building up to current
        building codes. If you just leave the old buildings alone,
        you don't have to upgrade. In Bearden's case, codes have
        gotten stricter since it opened in 1969. Most of the
        money for these additional classrooms is going to
        renovate what's already there. In order to build 24 classrooms,
        they have to renovate 41. And put in a million dollars
        worth of wiring and a new heating and cooling sytem. </p>
        <p>This is a problem with additions to virtually every
        school building in Knox County, I'm told. </p>
        <p>Make sense? </p>
        <p>* Sometimes arithmetic can be confusing, Part III.
        Knox County's school system has about 3,500 employees
        with teaching certificates and about 53,000 students. If
        you made everyone teach, that would be a teacher for every
        15 students. If every teacher only had 15 students, would
        you need all those counselors, assistant principals,
        cirriculum advisors, drug coordinators and federal form
        filling-out facilitators? We have been so busy creating
        support jobs to help the teacher on the front line, we
        have too few people on the front line. </p>
        <p>Wouldn't it be interesting to pass a law that no one
        (other than clerks, cooks and janitors) could be employed
        by a school system below superintendent level unless they
        taught classes? That's the best support the hard-pressed
        teachers could receive. </p>
        <p>(But for starters, it wouldn't be a bad idea that
        anyone who took a job outside the classroom automatically
        took a pay cut instead of getting a raise. If teaching is
        the most important thing, then how come they often make
        less than the support staff?) </p>
        <p>* There are a few goobers out there running for the
        state Legislature proposing bringing back chain gangs.
        Where do you think you are, Alabama? If you want
        prisoners to plant gardens around the prisons or do work
        to help pay for their keep, I'll be one of the first to
        say, have at it. But this state has a national reputation
        as a center for car making, Tennessee football, hit
        country records, the Smokies and amusement parks. </p>
        <p>What kind of idiot proposes that tourists on their way
        to Dollywood drive by chain gangs out on the interstate? </p>
        <p>Why don't you propose we summon up some other images
        from yesteryear: burn crosses at interstate interchanges;
        dress kids in rags and have them beg for coins at fast
        food restaurants; whitewash old car tires and bury them in
        the ground around the rest stops at the state line. </p>
        <p>Sometimes you just want to smack people. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">T</font>here is a proposal being put
        together for a major downtown Knoxville redevelopment
        project, a public-private partnership that involves the World's
        Fair site. </p>
        <p>The city of Knoxville is looking at building a new
        ballpark for the Knoxville Smokies. </p>
        <p>Then there is the ever-present discussion of a new
        convention center. </p>
        <p>Perhaps we need a ballpark big enough to hold
        conventions and have festive retailing vendors strolling
        about. With an IMAX scoreboard. </p>
        <p>One suspects that all these projects will remain in
        the talking stage until voters decide Nov. 5 whether to
        unify city and county government. There is also the
        possibility that, if unification passes, the turmoil of
        setting up a new government may occupy local leaders'
        attention for the next couple of years and derail some of
        these efforts. (Assuming anyone can find a local leader. See
        Lois Thomas's column on last Tuesday's Business front.) </p>
        <p>There are two common threads to all these projects --
        injecting more life into downtown and the spending of
        local tax money. </p>
        <p>I thought it might be useful to again recap the
        downtown redevelopment plan in Nashville, known as the
        Bicentennial Mall. </p>
        <p>Total cost: $51million. </p>
        <p>State contribution: $30million. </p>
        <p>Federal contribution: $20million. </p>
        <p>Nashville contribution: $1million. </p>
        <p>It can be argued, of course, that this project is to
        beautify the area around our state Capitol and is thus a
        state project. Sure it is. </p>
        <p>And, of course, the state has contributed money for
        Knoxville's waterfront project and for Chattanooga's
        aquarium. </p>
        <p>But the contribution to Knoxville's waterfront project
        is $3million. </p>
        <p>(We will ignore, for now, the state helping float
        $55million in bonds to build a stadium for the Oilers
        football team that will move to Nashville. Another statewide
        project?) </p>
        <p>Just about every plan anyone ever proposes for the
        World's Fair site has three problems in common: It
        ignores the fact that the site is a city park, and a lot
        of people think it is already developed; it involves
        moving the KUB substation; there are railroad tracks
        through the site. </p>
        <p>People proposing projects these days often ignore the
        first item and grandly propose moving the substation and
        the railroad tracks. </p>
        <p>What I can't figure out is this: Jake Butcher couldn't
        get them moved for the World's Fair; how are you going to
        get them moved for anything else? </p>
        <p>Maybe the railroads have mellowed. Maybe people
        nowadays don't mind spending $6million to move the
        substation. (Jake probably needed the $6million to invent
        the Caribbean pavilions to fill up space at the World's Fair
        or to cover some checks he and C.H. had written.) </p>
        <p>But I digress. </p>
        <p>If there were a viable development with private
        investment for downtown Knoxville, it would benefit the
        whole area -- the way the whole area benefits from Sevier
        County tourist development. </p>
        <p>The state has certainly (and quite rightly) invested
        millions in Sevier County bridge and road improvements to
        aid tourism. And one hopes they spend some more. </p>
        <p>Perhaps the argument can be made that the state ought
        to play a role in a regional economic benefit for the
        downtown area of the region's largest city. </p>
        <p>If every legislator in Knox County and in the
        surrounding metro area supported the idea, it might be a
        large enough voting block to win for Knoxville what
        Nashville got. </p>
        <p>We'll just take the 30mill. We'll forget about the
        federal pass-through funds and the Oilers deal. (Maybe we
        should copy Nashville. Maybe Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe
        could promise not to run against Gov. Don Sundquist in 1998.) </p>
        <p>One suspects the economic impact on downtown will be
        at least as beneficial as the state's current project --
        building a golf course in Cumberland County, the 10th
        such course in a county of about 35,000 people. </p>
        <p>The problem with finding capital for downtown
        development is fairly simple. If you have several million
        dollars to invest, would you put it in anybody's downtown
        or would you invest it on Highway 66, that route through
        Sevier County that is paved in gold? </p>
        <p>That's why most downtown projects around the country
        usually involve tax incentives or public expenditures for
        parking decks or roads or sidewalks. It may be that a
        development on the fair site is possible without moving
        the railroad tracks. </p>
        <p>The big problem with moving the railroad tracks is
        that they are attached to a bridge over the Tennessee
        River. A railroad might give up a section of track here
        and there, but giving up its only bridge across the river
        might pose a more difficult selling job. </p>
        <p>Another solution would be to move the tracks somewhere
        else. But finding an alternate right-of-way through
        downtown could prove difficult. It needs to be someplace
        where there is existing right of way, where it will not involve
        tearing anything down and a place that is not used for
        anything else. </p>
        <p>Hey, I've got it. </p>
        <p>How about re-routing the tracks down Gay Street? </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Frank Cagle News-Sentinel
        Managing Editor</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">I</font>t was revealed this week that
        House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh did not list his wife's
        sources of income or her lobbying activities on his
        financial disclosure form filed with the Registry of
        Election Finance. </p>
        <p>A few questions occur immediately: </p>
        <p>* Is the form so complicated that the speaker of the
        House can't understand it? </p>
        <p>* What was he thinking? Did he not think anyone would
        notice? </p>
        <p>* Do the people at the registry read these forms that
        they make the legislators fill out? </p>
        <p>The form was filled out and filed in January of this
        year. Ten months later it took the Tennessee Young
        Republicans filing a complaint to bring it to the registry's
        attention. </p>
        <p>It doesn't take the registry long to find violations
        among conservative political groups that criticize the
        legislative leadership, but no one there seem to notice
        that Capitol Hill's first couple was missing one of the
        partners on the disclosure form. </p>
        <p>Well, if they know his wife is a lobbyist, why is it a
        big deal if he left her off the form? Well, why do they
        require any legislator to fill it out? Capitol Hill is a
        small town, they all know each other. But that isn't the
        point, is it? The point is that this information is
        supposed to be on file and available to the public. It
        might benefit a citizen going down to work to restrict
        cigarette sales to know that the House speaker's wife is
        the lobbyist for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. </p>
        <p>Naifeh's wife is one of the most successful and
        effective lobbyists in Nashville. She was a successful
        lobbyist before she married him. </p>
        <p>Naifeh points out that he and his wife signed a
        prenuptial agreement so that he doesn't feel he has to
        report her sources of income. I suspect that the Legislature
        is full of two-income families and that there are a
        number of legislators who have separate checking accounts
        from their wives or husbands. But the form doesn't
        address whether you get the money. It asks where your
        spouse's income comes from, to identify conflicts of
        interest. </p>
        <p>That doesn't seem like a hard question. </p>
        <p>The prenup agreement only covers the time Naifeh is in
        office. So any wealth she accrues during his term of
        office will still be there when he is defeated on Nov. 5. </p>
        <p>Then there is a blank that asks about any areas that
        you or your spouse might be involved in that results in
        lobbying before the Legislature. </p>
        <p>He put ''none.'' </p>
        <p>I think there are several reasons he felt he could do
        that. One was pure arrogance and the knowledge that no
        one in any regulatory position in state government would
        have the nerve to question him. </p>
        <p>The other, I think, had to do with appearances. He
        didn't want to list on his disclosure form that his
        family unit was on the payroll of AT&amp;T, Corrections
        Corp. of America, various health-care concerns, a drug company
        and R.J. Reynolds. </p>
        <p>There it would be, right on his disclosure form. It
        might look like the ''appearance of an impropriety.'' </p>
        <p>We'll see if the registry levies a fine against Mr.
        Naifeh. If he is re-elected, that is. </p>
        <p>If no fine is levied, I would think that sends a
        signal to all the other legislators that they don't have
        to comply with ethics legislation or registry rules,
        either. </p>
        <p>At least the Democrats won't. </p>
        <p>It is a tribute to Naifeh's arrogance and his
        personality that as the speaker of the House, with a
        $250,000 campaign war chest, he is locked in a tight race
        for re-election with a Covington school teacher with no
        money. </p>
        <p>Theta Rone isn't getting any help from the state
        Republican Party, which appears to be afraid of offending
        the speaker. Republican officeholders have certainly kept
        their distance. </p>
        <p>Except for one. </p>
        <p>U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson has an event scheduled this
        Monday in Covington with Rone, providing an interesting
        contrast between Thompson's courage and character and
        some other elected Republicans I could mention. </p>
        <p>It helps explain why Thompson led the ticket in 1994
        and why he will lead it again Nov. 5. </p>
        <p>Political courage and character are things voters
        appreciate. </p>
        <p>It will be interesting to watch what happens when
        Speaker John Wilder delivers the state Senate back into
        the hands of the Democrats and if he were to be joined by
        a re-elected Naifeh. </p>
        <p>The state Republican Party will be in disarry for its
        ineptness and will be even easier prey for the Democrats
        to demolish before the gubernatorial elections in 1998. </p>
        <p>Bill Purcell has done a masterful job of running the
        statewide Democrat effort this election cycle. He will
        have accumulated a heavy bag of IOUs, a nice mailing list
        and the respect of his party's leaders. </p>
        <p>He will also be owed big time for delivering Tennessee
        to the Clinton/Gore column and avoiding an embarassment
        of the vice president in his home state. I have written
        before about how hard it is for a Nashvillian to get elected
        governor. (Richard Fulton, Jane Eskind, Phil Bredesen.) </p>
        <p>But the Democrats might not even need to find a West
        Tennessee redneck (Blanton, McWherter) to run for
        governor. </p>
        <p>A Nashvillian like Purcell and Republican ineptness
        may be enough. </p>

        <p><font size="2"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">L</font>ast thoughts before the election: </p>
        <p>* I can't get worked up either way on the vote to
        unify Knoxville and Knox County government. I think this
        is a wonderful community, and it will continue to be a
        wonderful community regardless of how the unification vote
        turns out. </p>
        <p>There is one thing, though, that I hope voters
        remember: This election is to decide a form of government
        that will be around for your children and grandchildren,
        probably. You ought to decide it on the issues and not on who
        occupies what political office. If you take the long
        view, it shouldn't matter who occupies the sheriff's
        office, the mayor's office or the county executive's
        office at present or who might win the county mayor's job
        if unification passes. </p>
        <p>In this case, the structure of government is more
        important than the personalities. </p>
        <p>The decision also shouldn't rest on the personalities
        of the people running either side of the campaign. Is a
        unified government going to benefit the community or not?
        I hope that's the question on which the election turns. </p>
        <p>* The national leadership of the Republican Party and
        the fat cats who financed him forced Bob Dole on us as
        the presidential nominee. These same people have spent
        the last several weeks trying to throw him over the side
        as a lousy, ineffectual candidate. We knew he was a
        lousy, ineffectual candidate during the primaries when he
        got beaten up by people like Pat Buchanan, Lamar
        Alexander and Steve Forbes. But they poured millions into
        his campaign, anointed him, and ran over the underfunded
        challengers. Well, they couldn't find enough money to run
        over an incumbent president, even if he is a lying
        scoundrel, so we are stuck with Dole. </p>
        <p>We may as well vote for him as an unindicted
        co-conspirator. </p>
        <p>You would think the Republican brain trust would learn
        after anointing a nonentity like George Bush, who was
        able to win one term in Ronald Reagan's reflected glory
        but lost the Republicans the White House in 1992, possibly
        for 16 years. </p>
        <p>If it had been up to the Washington power structure,
        Reagan would never have been president. Bush would have
        lost in 1980. </p>
        <p>In the year 2000, the following people should be
        banished if they show up at any Republican function
        having to do with presidential politics: Jack Kemp, Scott
        Reed, Haley Barbour, Steve Forbes, Pat Buchanan, Dan Quayle
        and Phil Gramm. </p>
        <p>It's time for William Weld, George Bush Jr., Fred
        Thompson, Connie Mack and their generation to take over. </p>
        <p>* Speaking of Lamar, you know he has been out
        campaigning for other candidates and for Dole-Kemp. Are
        you surprised that last week he was campaigning
        extensively in, you guessed it, Iowa? </p>
        <p>* Bill Jenkins, the GOP nominee for the 1st District
        House seat being vacated by Jimmy Quillen, should coast
        to victory Tuesday in heavily Republican upper East
        Tennessee. But I count at least three candidates who are
        already positioned to run in the Republican primary in
        1998. The days when the 1st District elected someone and
        then left him there for three decades is apparently over. </p>
        <p>* Houston Gordon is finding it tough going in his race
        against Thompson. He complains of a lack of support from
        the state party and that all the money he was promised to
        launch his kamikaze run at Thompson did not materialize. </p>
        <p>The party chiefs urged him to run to tie Thompson down
        so he couldn't campaign around the country for other
        senate candidates. </p>
        <p>One factor in Gordon's lack of support may be that the
        Democrat effort statewide is being directed by retiring
        Majority Leader Bill Purcell. If Purcell doesn't get a
        federal judgeship out of his efforts on behalf of Al Gore,
        he will probably run for governor in 1998. </p>
        <p>Why would Purcell want to publicize and build up the
        candidacy of Gordon, who, if he got high statewide
        visibility, might also be a gubernatorial candidate? </p>
        <p>It doesn't do any harm to Purcell to have Gordon flop
        big time in a statewide race. Especially since no one in
        the party really believed he could beat Thompson anyway. </p>
        <p>* There have been rumblings from the governor's office
        for almost a year about administrative costs at the
        University of Tennessee, but the state's ''fourth branch
        of government'' has seemingly turned a deaf ear to the thunder
        in the distance. Don Sundquist is known to have
        complained, for one thing, about UT President Joe Johnson
        having hired Billy Stair as his assistant. </p>
        <p>Stair is extremely competent and was Gov. Ned
        McWherter's chief aide. He was often referred to around
        the halls as ''Ned's brain.'' He went to UT in the waning
        days of the McWherter administration. Johnson is also impressed
        with Stair's ability and refuses to give him up. </p>
        <p>Sundquist turned up at the last trustee meeting in his
        capacity as ex officio chairman of that body to
        personally rail against escalating administrative costs
        at UT. He had a lot more than Stair on his mind. </p>
        <p>Is this a portent of a major shake-up in the UT
        administration, possibly including the president's
        office? </p>
        <p>Is there a politically savvy female executive high up
        in the Sundquist administration who sees herself as a
        university president? Possibly one with Tennessee Higher
        Education Commission experience? </p>
        <p>Stay tuned. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">W</font>ell, we had quite an election: </p>
        <p>* The weekly newspaper in Covington the week before
        the election had seven pictures of House Speaker Jimmy
        Naifeh handing a check to some organization or another.
        The pork distribution, a $250,000 campaign war chest and
        some of the toughest campaigning of his career returned
        Naifeh to his post with a 2,500-vote margin. </p>
        <p>The week before the election there was much gleeful
        optimism in our state Capitol about the prospect of
        Naifeh losing his election and having the House
        reorganized by some sort of good government coalition.
        Many members were quietly considering the prospect of
        being out from under the dictatorial meanness that has
        prevailed in that body since Naifeh ascended to power. </p>
        <p>Theta Rone, the Covington school teacher who scared
        Naifeh and his special-interest pals, ran a great
        campaign almost on her own. She had the help of the
        Tennessee Young Republicans, a few contributions from
        some conservative groups and U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson who
        stopped by to help out. Sevier County Republicans sent a
        contribution. I know of three House members who went down
        and campaigned for Rone. </p>
        <p>One wonders what would have happened if the gleeful
        chickens around the Capitol could have done something to
        help. They sat on their hands for months while Rone and
        her friends went up against Naifeh by themselves. </p>
        <p>Gov. Don Sundquist and Speaker John Wilder were
        allegedly hopeful that Naifeh wouldn't be back. But they
        weren't hopeful enough to go down and campaign for Rone.
        Part of Naifeh's district is in neighboring Fayette County,
        which is also in Wilder's Senate district. Wilder could
        have made a difference there. Naifeh got 70 percent of
        the Fayette County vote to offset Rone's totals in
        Covington. The Tipton County vote was 8,250 to 6,881, a difference
        of only 1,369 votes. </p>
        <p>The power went off in Tipton County election night,
        and no one could get election returns for the longest
        time. As it was relayed to me, a spectator said: ''When
        the lights came back on, Naifeh had won.'' </p>
        <p>Given Naifeh's personality, he will probably engage in
        enough petty vindictiveness over the next couple of years
        that some people may regret they didn't help Rone and
        encourage them to go down there next time around. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, those Memphis Republicans continue to move
        out to Tipton County in droves. </p>
        <p>It's a matter of time. </p>
        <p>* Will the Republican Party ever recover from David
        Copeland? </p>
        <p>Copeland was a Republican state representative from
        Ooltewah who fancied himself a tax and government finance
        expert. When Gov. Ned McWherter and others threw out the
        idea of putting in a state income tax, Copeland rushed in
        to stake out his turf. </p>
        <p>His particular brand of baloney was funding a
        feasibility study to reform the tax system that would
        make the argument that an income tax would be more fair
        and that sales taxes could be reduced. This would be used
        as a basis for a statewide referendum on repealing the
        constitutional prohibition against an income tax. </p>
        <p>It cost him his House seat when the income tax was
        hung around his neck. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, he didn't hang alone. </p>
        <p>Republican Sen. Leonard Dunavant, one of the brightest
        financial minds in the state Senate, signed on. He got
        beat. Likewise, bye, bye Republican Sen. Ray Albright. </p>
        <p>(I know, you political insiders are saying that the
        doctors wanted Dunavant beat and the Christian Right was
        after Albright. But the income tax was the tool they used
        to smash them.) </p>
        <p>The latest casualty to the Copeland madness was
        Cumberland County's state Rep. Shirley Duer, who lost a
        bid to move to the state Senate to replace the retiring
        Sen. Anna Belle Clement O'Brien. Her vote for that stinking
        feasibility study was the centerpiece of her opponent's
        campaign. </p>
        <p>That vote also prompted the Tennessee Conservative
        Union to endorse Democrat Lincoln Davis instead of Duer. </p>
        <p>The irony, of course, is that Democrats never get beat
        for voting for tax increases or for proposing an income
        tax. McWherter didn't even have a credible opponent when
        he ran for re-election. </p>
        <p>Republicans always get killed for it. </p>
        <p>* On the subject of the TCU and the Duer race, it's
        funny how political groups evolve. When the TCU attacked
        Democrat Justice Penny White, they were referred to in
        news stories in the Tennessean as ''two guys with a FAX
        machine.'' When they endorsed Democrat Davis against
        Duer, they were described in a news story in the
        Tennessean as ''the same group that successfully
        campaigned for the ouster of Tennessee Supreme Court
        Justice Penny White.'' I guess the two guys grew into a
        group and became a powerful political force when they
        started endorsing Democrats. </p>
        <p>* It is hard to really appreciate what a feat state
        Rep. Mike Williams accomplished in defeating Sen. Danny
        Wallace to represent the 4th District (Union, Grainger,
        Jefferson, Claiborne, Hancock and Hawkins counties). </p>
        <p>Wallace had incumbency and PAC money. He had Wilder
        campaigning for him. He even had members of the Sundquist
        administration helping him ''because we need the help of
        good conservative Democrats in order to govern.'' </p>
        <p>Williams doesn't take PAC money, and Sundquist refused
        to campaign for him for fear of offending Wilder. Now, of
        course, they need Williams to support their coalition
        since the state Republican Party managed to lose the state
        Senate to the Democrats. </p>
        <p>And Williams doesn't owe any of them anything. </p>
        <p>Once again, among high-profile Republicans, it was
        only Thompson and Sen. Bill Frist who campaigned with
        Williams. </p>

        <font size="5">T</font>here isn't anything in a democracy
        more important than the election process, especially the
        integrity of the results. Is this really something we ought
        to leave to the good intentions of the political parties? </p>
        <p>The very public problems the Knox County election
        staff had with the unification vote has put before the
        public a problem that has long been a behind-the-scenes
        scandal. From the county courthouse to the statehouse, the
        staffs that put on and record our elections have mostly
        been hired for their political backgrounds rather than
        their technical expertise. </p>
        <p>There was a lot of discussion at a meeting I attended
        last week about the election registrar being fired over
        the unification debacle. I predicted that it was just as
        possible that the election registrar would fire the
        election commissioners. </p>
        <p>Turns out it was a Mexican standoff. So far. </p>

        committee chairman and friend of the leadership, often
        lets other members of the Knox delegation be out front on
        pronouncements and announcements. But when it comes down to
        taking care of one of his own, nobody messes with him. </p>
        <p>Usually, Armstrong is content to let the Republicans
        think they run Knox County. Thursday afternoon he
        attended the election commission meeting and gave them a
        demonstration without saying a word. </p>
        <p>Under our present system, the state legislative
        delegations are responsible for four of the five election
        commissioners. The Republican members nominate two and
        the Democrats nominate two. </p>
        <p>In Knox County's case that means Armstrong and (for
        the Republicans) Sen. Ben Atchley. </p>
        <p>The fifth election commissioner is picked by the
        speaker of the House (and you know who he is), which
        means that the election commissions in all 95 counties
        are controlled 3-2 by the Democrats, even if the election commission
        is in a county where it is hard to find three Democrats
        to serve. </p>
        <p>That means they control the hiring of election staff
        and have for decades. </p>
        <p>One supposes that the speaker also listens to
        Armstrong when it comes to naming a chair for the
        election commission as well. So Armstrong controls three
        votes. </p>
        <p>But two Democrats and a Republican on the election
        commission were mad enough last week to fire the
        registrar and resign if necessary. But somewhere between
        Tuesday and Thursday they got their minds changed. </p>
        <p>Does the politicization of the election staff have any
        significance for the political process? </p>
        <p>Well, I can give you a couple of examples where an
        election commission staff might affect the outcome of an
        election, and you can decide for yourself. </p>
        <p>* Absentee ballots are received by the election
        commission staff and are to be counted in the presence of
        two people. But suppose on a Sunday morning before
        election day the election registrar goes down to the courthouse
        with 15 pens and pencils of all types of ink and opens
        all the ballots. And suppose the people who sent in the
        absentee ballots were only voting for president. And
        suppose that the registrar matches the ink and votes for
        all the local candidates from the registrar's party? The
        ballots can then be resealed and opened on election day. </p>
        <p>* Suppose the election commission staff decides that a
        particular candidate deserves a little help. Suppose all
        the voting machines are set with 99 votes for a
        particular candidate when the machines are delivered to
        the polling place. A small piece of white paper can be
        put over the opening so that when the election judge
        inspects the machines, it looks like no one has voted.
        The first real vote cast causes the tumbler to turn, the
        little white paper falls off, and the candidate starts
        the voting process 99 votes ahead on every voting
        machine. </p>
        <p>These are just some examples of how elections could be
        rigged. I'm sure nothing like this has ever really
        happened in Tennessee -- especially in Knox County. </p>
        <p>There is no such thing as public corruption in
        Tennessee. If there were, we would have an attorney
        general to prosecute it. But since we don't have an attorney
        general who can prosecute cases, then there must not be
        any corruption. </p>
        <p>I cite these theoretical scams to show you why it is
        extremely important that the election commission staff
        not have a vested interest in the outcome of elections. </p>
        <p>It also means that it matters who controls county
        election commissions. But election commissioners come and
        go, and the election commission staff tends to stay and
        stay. </p>
        <p>In most states, the secretary of state is an elected
        office. There is an official, answerable only to the
        voters, who is responsible for the integrity of the election
        process. This office also oversees campaign disclosures,
        financial disclosures and lobbyists. </p>
        <p>In Tennessee this is a job given to an out-of-work
        Democrat by the speaker of the House (and you know who he
        is). He doesn't even have to return your phone call, much
        less be accountable to you about how elections are run. </p>

		<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>here are two theories about Deputy Governor Peaches Simpkins.
<P>   One holds that she is an undercover agent for the Democrat Party, sent in to destroy the Sundquist administration.
<P>   The other theory is that she just has a natural talent for bureaucratic in-fighting and mayhem.
<P>   The most prevelant refrain is that over the first two years of Gov. Don Sundquist&#39;s administration she has systematically eliminated anyone who: had a political base; might offer the governor conflicting advice; posed a threat to her supremacy. The Peaches factor has often been cited in the brain drain afflicting the Sundquist administration during the past six months.
<P>   The responsibility for the Sundquist administration&#39;s effectiveness should rest at the top -- with the governor himself. If Peaches Simpkins is firing the Tennessee Higher Education Commission director or driving away staff members, then she is doing so at the behest of her boss. Otherwise, she wouldn&#39;t continue to be his most valued assistant.
<P>   There has been a steady exodus from the administration:
<P>   * Tom McNamara, Sundquist&#39;s top congressional aide for 12 years, who went back to Washington less than six months into the term.
<P>   * Bob Corker, commissioner of Finance and Administration, star of the cabinet, who resigned after 18 months.
<P>   * Leonard Bradley, a career public servant, architect of the Sundquist welfare reform, who took retirement after 18 months of serving the Sundquist administration.
<P>   * Susan Richardson-Williams, commissioner of Personnel, who held a variety of cabinet posts for Gov. Lamar Alexander as well and &#39;&#39;returned to the private sector&#39;&#39; after 18 months.
<P>   Some of these people had very real personal reasons for leaving, though these personal reasons probably existed before they joined the administration. These are among the most talented people Sundquist recruited, and they were expected to stay around a lot longer than they did.
<P>   Also leaving were Don Dills, Conservation commissioner, Margaret Culpepper, Employment Security commissioner, Billy Stokes, special assistant, and, lately, Bryant Millsaps, former House clerk, a &#39;&#39;Democrat for Don,&#39;&#39; executive director of Tennessee Higher Education Commission.
<P>   Sundquist fired Millsaps last week, though it was officially done by the THEC board and unofficially by Simpkins.
<P>   It was also Sundquist who told the University of Tennessee trustees that the university system is going to have to cut costs and needs to transfer resources from administration back to the classroom.
<P>   One suspects that Simpkins does have an agenda and that she grafts it onto Sundquist&#39;s plans and objectives. If Sundquist wants to reduce administrative costs at UT, then Simpkins can delight in the fact that it may include administration staff that includes old foe from the McWherter administration Billy Stair. Then it&#39;s a win-win, right?
<P>   (Simpkins was THEC director during the McWherter administration while Stair was a McWherter aide.)
<P>   But UT has friends everywhere, and I expect problems for Deputy Gov. Simpkins to start popping up all over the place.
<P>   Stories have begun appearing about Simpkins&#39; wheeling and dealing in the formation of a health care company from her state office. (Who does she think she is, Lamar!?)
<P>   I have predicted before that Sundquist will be hammered by the Democrats for the next two years in an effort to tear him down before the next gubernatorial election. It appears that the constitutional officers (secretary of state, comptroller, treasurer) will be the primary Democrat agents. These offices are historically the chief operatives for the Democrat Caucus.
<P>   For simplicity&#39;s sake, let&#39;s just call them the Gang of Three.
<P>   It was the Gang of Three that led the charge to save Millsaps&#39;s job. You might remember that it was these gentlemen who forced Millsaps out of the McWherter administration and opposed his being hired as THEC director in the first place. But getting at Sundquist is a much higher priority for the Gang of Three than quibbling over Millsaps.
<P>   Again, last week, it was Comptroller William Snodgrass who announced that his research shows that UT is much more efficient than Sundquist alleges. One suspects that Snodgrass got his research off a fax machine with a UT office on the other end of the line.
<P>   Vice President Al Gore wants Tennessee firmly in the control of the Democrats by 2000. That means the Democrat candidate for governor in 1998 will have all the money it takes to be competitive. They will come at Sundquist for all they are worth.
<P>   The sharks are circling. Simpkins will be first, and one of the most inviting, targets. After all, she is also an apostate from the Democrat Party, and they dislike her more than Millsaps.
<P>   But over the course of the next two years there will be a lot of blood in the water.

<!--SUBHEAD-->        <p><font size="2"><i>By Frank Cagle News-Sentinel

        <p><font size="2"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">S</font>ince it's Thanksgiving week, let's
        talk about turkeys. </p>
        <p>There are many similarities between environmentalists
        and journalists. </p>
        <p>People can call themselves one and whether or not they
        have credibility depends on their track record and,
        often, the organization for which they work. </p>
        <p>There are different standards and a corresponding
        level of confidence, for example, in a reporter for the
        Associated Press as opposed to the National Enquirer. </p>
        <p>Too often the public doesn't discern the difference
        between solid, reliable news organizations as opposed to
        a fly-by-night publication that gives the First Amendment
        a bad name. </p>
        <p>Too often journalists do not discern between
        responsible environmentalists making a carefully
        researched case as opposed to the uninformed ones who make
        hysterical charges and give environmentalism a bad name. </p>
        <p>Over the years The News-Sentinel has dealt with a
        variety of environmental groups in East Tennessee. You
        learn over time in whom you can believe and in whom you
        cannot. </p>
        <p>And you learn who the crazies are. </p>
        <p>The News-Sentinel has reported extensively on and
        supported editorially environmental groups trying to
        clean up the Pigeon River; the Foothills Land Conservancy
        purchasing a buffer zone around the Smokies; environmentalists
        fighting to cut down on sulphur dioxide emissions from coal-fired
        steam plants; and those working to stop fish kills in the
        Holston River. </p>
        <p>Then you have these efforts undercut by people like
        the Turkey Creek Alliance. </p>
        <p>The cause celebre for these logic-impaired shouters is
        a flooded hay field in the middle of West Knox County
        between Kingston Pike and Interstate 40. You probably
        never thought of Lovell Road as a wilderness area on par with
        the Everglades. </p>
        <p>Opponents of Parkside issue news releases, protest and
        stage TV demonstrations to try and prevent the block of
        land between Lovell Road and Campbell Station Road from
        being developed. They portray Parkside developers as
        Mother Nature rapers because the developers want to build another
        badly needed east-west traffic artery in addition to
        Kingston Pike and I-40 and develop that large chunk of
        property. </p>
        <p>These opponents are squandering valuable energy,
        resources and public credulity on this effort. </p>
        <p>Should anyone think fescue hay is an endangered
        species, I would suggest that they take a tour of greater
        East Tennessee. I think you will find that there is no
        shortage of hay fields. In fact, the reason part of this
        hay field is under water is, when I-40 was built,
        improper drainage between it and Lovell Road left water
        no place to go except to pool up in the field. </p>
        <p>To the developers of this project I can only offer the
        cynical old adage that no good deed goes unpunished. </p>
        <p>The so-called bad guys in the case consist of a fellow
        who has donated countless hours of his time (and money)
        as a board member for Ijams Nature Center. Another of the
        partners has donated 200 acres of wetlands in West
        Tennessee to the state for wildlife. </p>
        <p>There are 22 acres classified as wetlands on the West
        Knox County property. The Parkside Road would take about
        two of those acres. The developers propose to set aside
        34 acres of the property, including the wetlands and a
        buffer, in perpetuity. They have hired the environmental consultant
        that has helped the Disney Co. develop its Florida theme
        parks without damage to the Everglades to design this
        set-aside to protect a minnow presently found in Turkey
        Creek. </p>
        <p>The flame chub is a small minnow associated with
        spring water; it needs a constant temperature, especially
        in the heat of summer. The state classifies this species
        as special and in need of management, though it is not endangered.
        It is, more or less, on a watch list. </p>
        <p>These minnows are found in lots of places besides
        Turkey Creek, but this set-aside will ensure that they
        continue to live there. They hardly constitute a reason
        to stop the project. </p>
        <p>(Does anybody remember the snail darter?) </p>
        <p>The owners could have developed this property
        piecemeal and done whatever damage they wanted to the
        area, like most other West Knox County developments. But
        no, the owners wanted a comprehensive plan that balanced
        road needs, commercial development and still protected
        the creek bed. </p>
        <p>They have satisfied every state and federal agency
        that has oversight. </p>
        <p>But this is not good enough for the Turkey Creek
        Alliance, which is actually a front group for the
        Foundation for Global Sustainability. Global Sustainability
        is the group that had a press conference to contend that
        if TVA began operating the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, women
        in the Tennessee Valley would die of breast cancer. This
        was based on the specious reasoning that careless
        disposal of nuclear waste in Oak Ridge has caused a
        higher incidence of breast cancer in the area. Another
        reckless charge. </p>
        <p>Officialdom needs to grant whatever approvals are
        necessary for the Parkside project and let it proceed. </p>
        <p>Responsible environmentalists and conservationists
        call on business people every day to enlist their support
        in raising money, mobilizing community support and
        bringing political clout to bear. </p>
        <p>One hopes the business community doesn't judge their
        efforts by the obstructionist methods of the Turkey Creek
        Alliance. </p>

				<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>here&#39;s something going on in the state Department of Conservation and Environment that smells worse than the Pigeon River.
<P>   Commissioner Justin Wilson is Gov. Don Sundquist&#39;s point man on the Pigeon River clean-up effort, an issue very important to East Tennessee.
<P>   Wilson is also trying to put pressure on the Department of Energy to increase funding and increase the speed of clean-up efforts on the reservation in Oak Ridge. This is important for Oak Ridge as it tries to move to a diversified economy less dependent on government spending. Government spending is inevitably declining with the end of the Cold War.
<P>   Wilson also presided over the disbursement of state park grants this year that saw East Tennessee get its fair share of state park money for the first time in at least 10 years.
<P>   But the only thing you may know about Wilson is that he has been labeled a racist because he allegedly said he wanted to recruit black employees for his department but &#39;&#39;refuses to lower standards.&#39;&#39;
<P>   In order to become a conservation officer, which involves carrying a weapon, a job applicant has to go through the state police academy, go through additional state training, then take an entry-level job for about $18,000.
<P>   Any qualified black candidate who wants to be a ranger can go to the National Park Service and start for $25,000.
<P>   That&#39;s why there aren&#39;t too many black conservation officers.
<P>   Wilson tried to explain that to a black employee of the Conservation Department, but he evidently didn&#39;t do a very good job. The employee went to the state employees association, who tipped off a Black Caucus member and Wilson was branded a racist from Bristol to Memphis. They contend Wilson suggested he wanted black officers but refused to lower standards.
<P>   There seems to be a refusal to recognize that he meant he couldn&#39;t do anything about the cumbersome standards that discourage minority candidates from pursing a job as a conservation officer.
<P>   There is a difference in suggesting that you have to lower standards in order for black candidates to pass them, which is not true, than in pointing out that requirements can discourage black applicants because they can get a better job, easier, someplace else.
<P>   I have suggested that state employees will be the point people in efforts to hammer Sundquist for the next couple of years before the 1998 election. This little incident is a good example.
<P>   Sundquist has been trying to take state park managers out of civil service and set performance standards for these managers. This would encourage efficiency and possibly help some of them be more self-supporting. This has angered the state employees association, which opposes anyone not being covered by civil service or any job not being available to Democrat patronage. This conversation Wilson had with a black employee (that he was trying to promote, by the way) was seized upon and relayed to a Black Caucus member in order to embarrass Wilson and Sundquist.
<P>   It was pay-back time.
<P>   West Tennessee state Sen. Milton Hamilton will be the new Conservation and Environment Commissioner come January. One hopes this incident doesn&#39;t prevent Wilson serving in another capacity.
<P>   * My friend Loy Smith has castigated me severely for putting Billy Stokes in the &#39;&#39;also leaving&#39;&#39; Sundquist&#39;s staff category in a recent column instead of in the group that included Bob Corker, Susan Richardson-Williams and other stars who have left. Smith points out that Stokes has often been praised for being a moderating influence on Deputy Gov. Peaches Simpkins. In other words, he didn&#39;t deserve to be in the same paragraph with former Environment and Conservation Commissioner Don Dills, a former Democrat legislator from West Tennessee and Sundquist&#39;s worst appointment.
<P>    Smith also points out that, with Stokes leaving, there is no Knoxvillian in a cabinet or staff post.
<P>    Simpkins herself has now announced that she is leaving, though she was supposed to stay around at least through the next session of the General Assembly. But she was about to get too hot to handle as the Sundquist bashers made her the focus of the-appearance-of-an-impropriety scandal.
<P>   It&#39;s OK for the speaker of the House to hide his wife&#39;s lobbying income by leaving it off his disclosure form. That warrants a couple of paragraphs in a Nashville newspaper. But Simpkins&#39; crime was her name appearing on the letterhead of a health care company. That story was on its way to becoming a Ray Blanton-sized scandal.
<P>   Stokes will be coming back to Knoxville to practice law, having done the two years he promised. Sundquist praised him as a star of the cabinet as far back as the first three months of the administration and moved him from a cabinet post to his personal staff.
<P>   He was one of the few people who could get along with Simpkins, and he will be sorely missed by Sundquist. There are many people who think he was one of the most effective officials in the administration.
<P>   (OK, Loy. Satisfied?)

        <font size="5">W</font>ithin the next two months there is
        an opportunity for two elected officials to become heroes
        in the effort to clean up the Pigeon River. </p>
        <p>If either fail to step forward, East Tennessee should
        never forgive them nor should we ever forget. </p>
        <p>There will be no points awarded for hypocrisy or for
        posturing. </p>
        <p>Only results. </p>
        <p>The Pigeon Rivers belongs to the people of the United
        States. Congress has decreed, via the Clean Water Act,
        that rivers should not be used by anyone as a repository
        for filth. </p>
        <p>Champion International's mill at Canton, N.C., has
        been polluting the river for 88 years. The Clean Water
        Act was passed over 15 years ago. Seven years ago
        Champion was given an exemption from the act that allowed
        them to continue to pollute in return for modernizing the
        mill. They want another variance that will allow them to
        continue on the same path for another five years. </p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has been given the
        responsibility to see that the waters of America be kept
        clean. </p>
        <p>The Atlanta office of the EPA, presided over by one
        John Hankinson, Region IV administrator, has failed
        miserably in its responsibility to the Pigeon River. </p>
        <p>Mr. Hankinson's office should be sued, and he should
        be fired. </p>
        <p>The person who should sue the EPA office is Tennessee
        Gov. Don Sundquist, who has pledged to clean up the
        river. He should immediately instruct the state attorney
        general's office to take whatever legal steps are
        necessary to see to it that the EPA bureaucrats do their
        job properly. </p>
        <p>The man who should see to it that Hankinson does his
        job or be transferred to Nome, Alaska, is Vice President
        Al Gore. </p>
        <p>Gore has made a career out of whining about the
        environment. His career and best-selling book has been
        based on his so-called concern for acid rain, ozone holes
        and the destruction of rain forests. </p>
        <p>It might interest his nationwide constituency, who
        want him to be president in the year 2000, that he has
        never lifted a finger to help clean up the Pigeon River.
        Gore was elected to two terms in the U.S. Senate from
        Tennessee. During that time, while he was writing ''Earth
        in the Balance,'' the dumping of the Canton, N.C., paper
        mill effluent into the Pigeon River continued unabated. </p>
        <p>At a crucial point (1988) in one of the periodic
        windows of opportunity for getting improvements in the
        river, Gore was running for president and sold out his
        Tennessee constituents in return for North Carolina votes
        in the Super Tuesday primary. </p>
        <p>Gore's alleged hypocrisy on tobacco cannot compare to
        his hypocrisy on the environment and the issue of
        cleaning up the Pigeon River. Gore has been criticized
        for making an impassioned speech at the Democratic
        Convention attacking tobacco, using his sister's death by
        cancer as an example. But he continued for years after
        her death to either grow tobacco or receive income from
        his tobacco allotment on the family farm in Carthage. He
        campaigned, again in North Carolina in 1988, as a tobacco
        farmer who understood tobacco industry concerns. </p>
        <p>Gore has gotten a free ride on the Pigeon River
        because environmental groups are uneasy about attacking
        the poster boy for environmental causes. I think it's
        time that the environmental groups that have given Gore
        so much support and so much cover on this issue call in
        their debt. </p>
        <p>Champion should be required to test the water at the
        discharge pipe, not 40 miles downstream. Every day, not a
        monthly average. No more than 50 color units beside the
        plant. A date certain must be set on when Champion will
        comply. </p>
        <p>I am told that Gore's office is very concerned about
        the situation down here in East Tennessee and has begun
        asking questions about the EPA's Atlanta office. </p>
        <p>One expects the following scenario: </p>
        <p>* Gore and the EPA will say that Sundquist's
        administration did not speak up soon enough or forcefully
        enough, and that is why the EPA acquiesced to North
        Carolina in allowing Champion to get yet another variance
        which exempts them from the Clean Water Act. </p>
        <p>* Sundquist will decry the inaction of the EPA and
        give the feds and North Carolina the devil for not doing
        the right thing. </p>
        <p>Each can blame the other for the failure of the EPA to
        act. </p>
        <p>At some point in the next four years both Gore and
        Sundquist will come before the voters of East Tennessee. </p>
        <p>We have three choices: </p>
        <p>A. Vote for Gore and blame Sundquist. </p>
        <p>B. Vote for Sundquist and blame Gore. </p>
        <p>C. Swear on a stack of bibles that we will never vote
        for either one of them again. </p>
        <p>Over the next 60 days we will have to decide between
        A, B or C. </p>
        <p>A dirty Pigeon River leaves C as the only alternative.
        </p>
        <p>It's your move, gentlemen. </p>

        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">I</font>t is now possible for you, as a
        news and information consumer, to create your own virtual
        reality. </p>
        <p>There are more and more niche products out there
        nibbling away at the mass communications market. The
        business implications for network news divisions and
        daily newspapers are obvious, and I leave those issues to
        be debated among the people affected. </p>
        <p>I'm concerned about what it does to our republic. </p>
        <p>For instance. </p>
        <p>It is now possible for a conservative to read the
        Weekly Standard magazine, the editorial page of the Wall
        Street Journal, watch C-span and listen to Rush Limbaugh
        on the radio. You get an in-depth take on the passing
        political scene, and you are certainly exposed to a large
        body of ideas about government reform, campaign financing
        and election strategies. </p>
        <p>And you will rarely be confronted by anything that
        contradicts your point of view or presents an idea in a
        way you hadn't thought about before. </p>
        <p>It is now possible for young people (and some not so
        young) to get their news and information from MTV, Comedy
        Central or, horror of horrors, Beavis and Butthead. There
        is even an alternative press that has grown up in cities
        around the country in which most of the space is devoted
        to entertainment but also contains news with an attitude.
        </p>
        <p>Liberals can still depend on the New York Times,
        National Public Radio and the New Yorker. </p>
        <p>There is also an entire subset of the population that
        gets all its information from the Internet, which can be
        wonderfully informative or a pernicious purveyor of
        rumors and lies, depending on where you look. </p>
        <p>(This presents another problem between the people with
        computer access and those who do not. This further
        divides our sense of community.) </p>
        <p>There is a magazine devoted to almost every single
        topic constituency, from Sailing to the American
        Rifleman. </p>
        <p>In fact, people are becoming so used to having
        products that cater only to their beliefs or contain only
        articles about their particular hobbyhorse that they are
        sometimes offended when exposed to a mass medium that
        contains something with which they do not agree or
        contains something in which they have no interest. </p>
        <p>There was a time when we didn't expect to agree with
        every columnist or comic strip or news report. </p>
        <p>There are those readers who despise New York Times
        columnist Frank Rich. And there are those readers who
        intensely dislike Cal Thomas, Theotis Robinson or Maureen
        Dowd. </p>
        <p>And, believe it or not, there are readers who despise
        my column. (There's no accounting for taste.) </p>
        <p>Well, isn't it a good thing that people can get
        exactly what they want? </p>
        <p>But would you consider the possibility that there
        might be something out there that you want, but you won't
        know you want it unless you are at least exposed to it? </p>
        <p>And what are the consequences of your closing yourself
        off to opposite points of view? </p>
        <p>I got to thinking about all this watching the Clinton
        campaign cream Bob Dole over and over again for being
        against Medicaid, destroying education and running up the
        deficit. For the past 15 years there has been a serious
        debate among conservatives about the nature and
        limitations of government. A consensus has developed
        among conservatives, thrashed out in the National Review,
        the American Spectator and other opinion journals, that
        reached its political apogee in the Contract With
        America. </p>
        <p>Conservatives understand all the arguments about
        abolishing the Department of Education: keep scholarships
        administration at the college level, keep local control
        of schools, eliminate the Washington bureaucracy and send
        the money back to local government, prevent federal
        brainwashing being slipped into the curriculum. </p>
        <p>It is anti-federalism that goes back to Jeffersonian
        democracy. </p>
        <p>All these issues have been hashed out among
        conservatives for a decade. </p>
        <p>That may be why Republicans couldn't understand why,
        when Clinton said Dole wanted to abolish the Department
        of Education, they were nodding their heads while America
        was horrified and voting for Clinton as the education
        president. </p>
        <p>It works the other way also. </p>
        <p>Liberal journals have made the case for crashing the
        glass ceiling and retaining affirmative action. But put
        it before the voters, as in California in the last
        election, and you find out the public repudiates such
        programs. </p>
        <p>If we all insist on only hearing and seeing what we
        want to hear and see, there will be no dialogue in our
        democracy and in our voting process: only shouting and
        the muscle flexing of special interest groups. </p>
        <p>Diversity of opinion is good. News and information
        from diverse sources prevents a monolithic media. </p>
        <p>We should enjoy our bounty of information sources, but
        we cannot afford to withdraw from the mainstream of
        society. </p>
        <p>We should remember that, while diversity can bring
        strength, it is the things we hold in common that keep us
        together as a society. </p>
        <p>We cannot have a meaningful discussion if we all have
        a different view of reality. </p>

<title>Higher court should rein in Judge Nixon</title>

        rein in Judge Nixon<!--SUBHEAD--></b></font><p><font size="2"><i>By
        Harry Moskos, News-Sentinel editor</i></font></p>
        <p><br>
        <font size="5">J</font>udge Gilbert Merritt of the Sixth
        U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told the Commercial Appeal
        in Memphis that there is ''no acceptable reason'' that
        two death-penalty cases from Memphis have languished
        before the court for more than a year. </p>
        <p>Both cases involve U.S. District Judge John Nixon of
        Nashville, who has a record of overturning death
        sentences. His actions usually are reversals of
        convictions that have been around a long time, thus
        making it difficult to retry the cases. </p>
        <p>Merritt, who recently concluded a rotating assignment
        as presiding judge of the Sixth Circuit, said he could
        not explain the delays but noted that the 16-judge court
        is operating with three vacancies. </p>
        <p>State Attorney General Charles Burson filed an appeal
        more than two years ago when in 1994 Nixon overturned the
        conviction and death sentence of Ronald Rickman. The
        state filed an appeal in 1995 over Nixon's reversal of
        William Groseclose's conviction and death sentence. </p>
        <p>Groseclose was convicted of hiring Rickman to kill his
        wife, Deborah Groseclose, in 1977. She was raped, stabbed
        and left in the trunk of a car where she was found dead.
        Her sister, Rebecca Easley, obviously upset with Nixon's
        rulings, told the Associated Press that the courts have
        to move faster, adding, ''We've been on this ride for
        20years now, and we want to get off.'' </p>
        <p>In addition to the Groseclose-Rickman rulings, Nixon
        has been involved in two other recent cases involving
        reversal of death-penalty sentences. </p>
        <p>Nixon has reversed the death sentences of Robert Glen
        Coe, who was convicted of killing an 8-year-old girl in
        1979, and of Richard Austin, who was sentenced in 1977 in
        a murder-for-hire case. </p>
        <p>When Merritt was presiding judge of the court last
        year, the Sixth Circuit dismissed 12 complaints against
        Nixon, claiming that he had delayed taking action on
        death-penalty cases before him. One of the complaints
        came from Easley, who said she could not believe the
        Sixth Circuit did nothing to admonish Nixon. </p>
        <p>A column we wrote last year about the Sixth Circuit's
        lack of action brought a note from Judge Merritt, who
        said: ''I deal with complaints against judges every day,
        and I don't mind being criticized if the facts justify.
        Before you criticize people publicly you should at least
        call to find out the facts and what the process is. In my
        action in this case, I criticized the delay.'' </p>
        <p>While Merritt and his fellow judges officially
        criticized the delays, they really have not taken any
        strong or lasting steps to stop them, except to
        acknowledge that there is ''no acceptable reason.'' </p>
        <p>The U.S. Supreme Court in 1976 allowed states to again
        impose the death penalty. No executions, however, have
        been carried out in Tennessee since that ruling. The main
        reason is that Judge Nixon takes notorious murder cases
        that are many years old and reverses the convictions. It
        is time for Nixon to step down as an active federal judge
        and take senior status. </p>
        <p>Until the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals really moves
        on these cases by stopping Nixon from hearing
        death-penalty appeals, the wheels of justice in Tennessee
        will grind slowly, very slowly. </p>

        <p><br>
        <font size="5">O</font>ne of the young women in the
        Florence Crittenton Agency's residential treatment
        program wrote an unsolicited note to say thank you for
        the help she received from the program and to members of
        the community for supporting the agency. </p>
        <p>The 17-year-old wrote: </p>
        <p>''I just wanted to say thanks to all the people that
        gave to the Florence Crittenton Agency this holiday
        season. As a client of the agency, I feel that there are
        many more children out in the city of Knoxville that will
        not have all the love I have been shown this year. </p>
        <p>''I have felt in the past year that I have been
        treated unfairly by DCS (state Department of Children
        Services) and the agency itself, but now that the holiday
        season is on us I feel now that the agency has provided
        me many more opportunities than I had before. I just wish
        that all teenage girls could have the love and support I
        have been shown at the Florence Crittenton Agency. </p>
        <p>''Thanks so much.'' </p>
        <p>This particular young woman came to the Florence
        Crittenton Center as a ward of the state because of
        sexual abuse by her stepfather and lack of protection by
        her mother, said Cile Mathews, the agency's executive
        director. </p>
        <p>The teenager is participating in the agency's Barrett
        Hall Program, which provides residential mental health
        treatment for the individual and her family, as well as
        an on-campus school. </p>
        <p>Mathews said when she came to the agency, the young
        woman lacked self-esteem and control of anger which raged
        within her. </p>
        <p>''Now she is able to control her behaviors most of the
        time and is much less angry and depressed,'' Mathews
        said. ''She also realizes the opportunities available for
        happiness and productivity and is much more able to take
        advantage of those opportunities.'' </p>
        <p>One of the goals of the Barrett Hall Program is to
        prepare young women to live independently when they
        become adults at age 18. </p>
        <p>This young woman's thanks to the community is in
        appreciation of the public's support of the Florence
        Crittenton Agency, which gets assistance through
        donations directly to the agency as well as through the
        United Way. </p>
        <p>There are three residential programs at the center. In
        addition to the Barrett Hall Program, the other programs
        are a substance-abuse treatment program primarily for
        pregnant teens but also involving nonpregnant teens and a
        program for pregnant women, primarily single women but
        also including married women in crisis or at risk. </p>
        <p>The Florence Crittenton Agency also has outreach
        programs to prevent child abuse, which is currently in
        six area high schools, and a program to prevent teen
        pregnancy, which is in all Knox County schools, primarily
        at the seventh and eighth grades. </p>
        <p>The 17-year-old's letter points out what many of us
        take for granted: the good work performed by social
        service agencies that survive only through the support of
        the citizens of the community. The Florence Crittenton
        Agency is one such organization that deserves our
        continued support and thanks. </p>

        <p><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>he five-alarm fire that swept
        through musician Lionel Hampton's high-rise apartment in
        New York City earlier this month certainly called
        attention to the dangers of halogen lamps. </p>
        <p>The legendary Hampton, who is now 83, broke music's
        color line when he joined the Benny Goodman band in the
        1930s. The fire destroyed everything Hampton had from his
        distinguished career, including his vibraphone. </p>
        <p>It took 200 firefighters more than two hours to bring
        the fire under control. Twenty-seven people were injured.
        The fire started when a halogen lamp in Hampton's
        apartment tipped over and ignited bedding. </p>
        <p>Norman Hammitt, public information officer for the
        Knoxville Fire Department, says since 1992 there have
        been 10 deaths and 20 injuries nationally related to
        halogen lamps and the bulbs used in them. </p>
        <p>No injuries or deaths have been recorded in Knoxville,
        but County Fire Marshal Wayne Waggoner notes that there
        were three fires in Knox County attributed to halogen
        lamps within the past 60 days. </p>
        <p>An apartment and a house sustained minor damage
        because the occupants were able to extinguish the fires
        promptly, but the third fire destroyed a house. </p>
        <p>''They're dangerous,'' said Waggoner, noting that the
        bulbs can get so hot they set anything around them on
        fire. </p>
        <p>In one of the Knox County fires, the halogen lamp's
        500-watt bulb ignited adjacent curtains; in another fire,
        the bulb's heat ignited a bookshelf made of particle
        board. </p>
        <p>The bulbs used in halogen lamps can reach temperatures
        of up to 1,500degrees, Hammitt noted. By comparison, a
        75-watt incandescent bulb's temperature will reach
        260degrees. </p>
        <p>Last month, the Tensor Corp. voluntarily recalled
        100,000 of the 500-watt tubular halogen bulbs sold in
        50,000 torchiere (or pole) style lamps. </p>
        <p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission advises
        that halogen bulbs may shatter during use, presenting a
        fire hazard when hot filaments of the shattered bulb land
        on nearby combustible materials. The CPSC has recorded
        281 incidents of bulbs shattering. </p>
        <p>While it is recommended to replace the 500-watt bulb
        with a lower 300-watt bulb, Waggoner is still leery,
        noting that the 300-watt bulb can reach a temperature of
        nearly 1,000degrees. </p>
        <p>Hammitt, Waggoner and the CPSC offer these safety
        tips: </p>
        <p>* Never place halogen lamps where the tubular bulb
        could come in contact with curtains or other cloth window
        treatments. Keep them away from elevated beds, such as
        bunk beds, where bedding might get too close to the bulb.
        </p>
        <p>* Never leave a halogen lamp on when you leave the
        room or are not at home. </p>
        <p>* Never drape clothes, paper or flammable material
        over a halogen lamp. </p>
        <p>* For torchiere lamps equipped with a dimmer switch,
        operate the lamp at a setting lower than the maximum
        whenever possible. </p>
        <p>Lionel Hampton is fortunate that he escaped without
        injury, but it is still a tragedy that he lost a
        priceless collection of mementoes, including records,
        music, instruments as well as photographs and letters
        from presidents dating back to Harry S Truman. </p>
        <p>Our fire officials want to be sure the same thing does
        not happen to you. </p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>August 4, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>INTAKE CENTER DESERVES 
CONSIDERATION, TOO </h2>
<p><em>By Harry Moskos, Editor</em></p>
<p>Local government officials on Thursday will receive a final draft report from 
Carter Goble Associates on what direction Knox County should take in 
planning and constructing a new justice system complex.</p>
<p>A justice center, when all phases are completed, could house not only the 
courts and attorney general but law enforcement offices, a much-needed and 
court-mandated intake center where prisoners are booked and processed, a 
jail and support facilities such as court clerks and probation officers.</p>
<p>The study's goal is to develop a plan including all components of a justice 
system with an analysis of the needs for use of existing plus future space. The 
study will be presented to the Knox County Justice Study Committee 
chaired by County Commissioner Frank Leuthold.</p>
<p>What is significant is the study represents a move by the county to properly 
plan and implement a program instead of rushing helter-skelter without 
guidance into a project -- especially one that is going to cost as much as $50 
million over as many as 10 years or more.</p>
<p>If the county had been prudent in the past, the budget-draining Knox County 
Regional Farmers' Market would not have been rushed into construction. Or 
residents in East Knox County today would not be upset over noise from a 
firing range at a sheriff's department training facility.</p>
<p>The intake center issue was in the public eye long before Tommy Schumpert 
was elected Knox County executive. The federal court had said the county 
needed a new intake center because existing facilities did not meet 
standards. Sheriff Tim Hutchison continues to say the intake center is unsafe 
and poorly designed.</p>
<p>Schumpert, however, was the official who said something as complicated as 
a justice center, of which the intake center would be a component, needed 
proper planning.</p>
<p>Locations for a new intake center were bantered about. The first site 
suggested was the old Sears Building on Fifth Avenue. Residents in the area, 
with justification, objected. That idea was dropped. The front lawn of the 
City County Building was then proposed, but that site, too, was 
unacceptable.</p>
<p>The county went as far as to include a bond issue for an intake center on 
L-3, a lower level of the City County Building, only to discover in time that 
location would not work. Before the last county executive election, the 
county built a temporary intake center at its existing location in the City 
County Building.</p>
<p>During the election campaign of 1994, Schumpert noted that construction of 
the intake center had been delayed for five years because of inadequate 
planning. The expense of the one built was a short-term fix to a long-term 
problem without any residual value to the taxpayers for the money it cost.</p>
<p>If planning for the intake center and justice center had been considered 
seven years ago when the federal court first told the county to fix the 
problem, it would have been done and we would not be talking about it 
now.</p>
<p>We urge our elected officials to seriously consider the findings of the Carter 
Goble study. Everyone needs to continue working together, and equally 
important is that everyone in local government acknowledge that their offices 
are interrelated.</p>
<p>It would be folly not to consider the intake center in context with the overall 
needs of a complete justice center. To do otherwise would be inefficient and 
continue to add unnecessary costs to the taxpayer.</p>

UNIFICATION </h2>
<p><em>By Harry Moskos, News-Sentinel Editor</em></p>
<p>There clearly are advantages to a unified form of government for Knoxville 
and Knox County. In the long run, a unified government would save money 
and increase efficiency.</p>
<p>One recent news story illustrates how Knox County stands to gain 
financially.</p>
<p>If you live in the far west sections of Knox County, your electric service 
comes from the Lenoir City Utilities Board in Loudon County instead of the 
Knoxville Utilities Board.</p>
<p>This means Lenoir City's budget gets a hefty cash gift, courtesy of Farragut 
and Knox County residents.</p>
<p>Under a unified form of government, however, Knox County would gain 
about $1million a year represented by the in-lieu-of-tax payments Lenoir 
City Utilities Board gives to Lenoir City. The money comes from the 
30,000Knox County residents getting electricity from the Loudon County 
utility.</p>
<p>A unified government would allow KUB to take over service of ratepayers 
living in Knox County, which means money paid by Knox Countians for 
electricity would go to fund Knox County projects.</p>
<p>State Sen. Bud Gilbert of Knoxville notes that Knox County is supporting 
Lenoir City's government through the in-lieu-of-tax payments. One would 
think that Knox County citizens (and elected officials for that matter) would 
prefer that their money support their own government instead of one in 
another county.</p>
<p>Unification also should bring an end to bickering between local government 
agencies. That alone would be reason enough to vote for unification.</p>
<p>The sheriff recently objected to city police conducting an undercover 
investigation in the county, noting that ``there are jurisdictional limits to the 
authority of a Knoxville city police officer.''</p>
<p>Under unification, there would be just one law enforcement department 
serving Knoxville and Knox County. This would end jurisdictional 
squabbles, and thus the cops could go after the bad guys instead of each 
other.</p>
<p>Another recent news story pointed out the strain in relations between the 
two law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>The Knoxville Police Department has been trying for five years to work with 
the Knox County Sheriff's Department on establishing a system to obtain 
mug shots and fingerprints of arrested suspects. The sheriff, however, said 
the city's $57,000 computerized imaging system was incompatible with the 
computer system he sought for the county. The city's system was ordered 
out of the county jail.</p>
<p>That was five years ago. The county still doesn't have a computerized 
imaging system since it recently rejected -- because of performance 
problems -- the $6.6million system the sheriff's department had selected.</p>
<p>Unified government means marching to one agenda with one voice. Disputes 
over computer systems would be settled by a single legislative body working 
with one budget.</p>
<p>A unified government for Knoxville and Knox County is long overdue.</p>

CITIZENS</h2>
<p><em>By Harry Moskos, News-Sentinel Editor</em></p>
<p>The ouster of Penny White from the Tennessee Supreme Court by the 
voters indicates that Americans seek more accountability from the judicial 
system.</p>
<p>Many believe that the pendulum, swinging in favor of the criminal, is finally 
starting to sway in the other direction.</p>
<p>Several of White's rulings, both as an Appeals Court judge and later as a 
Supreme Court justice, were based on strict interpretations of the law but 
nevertheless became controversial because of the crimes involved.</p>
<p>``The procedural dotting of every `i' and crossing of every `t' has become 
more important than the crime's substance,'' wrote New York Criminal 
Court Judge Harold J. Rothwax in a recent article for Parade magazine.</p>
<p>Rothwax, a Democrat, went on to describe this country's justice system as 
``a carefully crafted maze, constructed of elaborate and impenetrable 
barriers to the truth.'' Citizens are upset by cases that are reversed by 
appellate courts on technical issues that could be interpreted differently.</p>
<p>Court of Criminal Appeals Judge John Peay of Clarksville recently wrote an 
opinion that left many citizens confused because it involved a technicality.</p>
<p>Peay's ruling threw out an aggravated sexual battery conviction involving a 
child rape victim because the ruling lacked lucid legal language.</p>
<p>The indictment failed to allege that the defendant had committed the offense 
``intentionally, knowingly or recklessly.'' The indictment had only stated that 
the defendant had ``unlawfully'' raped a child. The judge's ruling said that the 
use of just that one word was not enough to satisfy the legal standard of 
alleging a defendant's mental state.</p>
<p>To the average person, it was another case of an undotted ``i'' and an 
uncrossed ``t'' that didn't make sense.</p>
<p>Since 1989, prosecutors in this state have relied on that same ``unlawful'' 
reference when the Legislature revised the criminal statutes. Why after seven 
years is there suddenly a ruling that possibly could lead to a reversal of sex 
crime convictions across the state? The ire of the citizens will be felt if the 
prison doors are opened to free hundreds of sex offenders just because a 
court rules the indictments were not properly worded.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the citizens are upset or else White would not have become 
the first Tennessee high court justice to lose in a yes-no referendum. While 
we supported White's retention on the court, we also realized that there are 
problems in the system.</p>
<p>Two of White's controversial rulings involved murder cases. There has not 
been a death sentence carried out in Tennessee since the U.S. Supreme 
Court lifted the ban on legal executions in 1976. There are about 100 
inmates on death row in Tennessee.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge John Nixon of Nashville has blocked the state from 
carrying out any death penalty sentences, but he is shielded from the voters 
because of his lifetime appointment to the federal bench. White easily could 
have been Nixon's scapegoat by voters irritated by judicial delaying tactics.</p>
<p>Jeff Jacoby, a columnist for The Boston Globe, wrote recently, ``regrettably, 
federal judges are named for life.'' We, too, have written on several 
occasions of the flaw in the concept of appointing judges for life.</p>
<p>Jacoby wrote that the most enlightened court systems are those that blend 
executive appointment with a nonpartisan public vote so the judges ``from 
day one know that the people in whose name they pass judgment will 
eventually pass judgment on them.''</p>

MARKET</h2>
<p><em>By Harry Moskos, News-Sentinel Editor</em></p>
<p>One of the pleasures of being a journalist is to see a gifted colleague 
honored.</p>
<p>That was the occasion a week ago today when Louise Durman, food editor 
of The News-Sentinel, received tributes for her work in a ceremony 
attended by nearly 200 people at the Knox County Regional Farmers' 
Market.</p>
<p>The event cited Louise for supporting the Tennessee Fruit and Vegetable 
Growers Association and University of Tennessee Agriculture Extension 
Service as well as her efforts in emphasizing home-grown products.</p>
<p>Among those there were U.S. Rep. Jimmy Duncan, who praised her for 
doing ``so much for the farmer,'' and Knox County Executive Tommy 
Schumpert who noted that ``we're glad you came our way because you 
made our lives so much better.''</p>
<p>There even was a letter from President Clinton who cited Louise as ``a 
wonderful example of the proud American tradition of excellence in 
journalism.'' Mayor Victor Ashe issued a proclamation in her honor.</p>
<p>Louise, who grew up in New Castle, Ind., came to The News-Sentinel as 
food editor in 1967. Her previous newspaper experience included work 
with The Washington Post and as food editor of The Indianapolis News. 
She started her newspaper career after earning a bachelor's degree from 
Purdue University and a master's from the Columbia School of Journalism in 
New York.</p>
<p>Other tributes came from Dr. Ray Humberd, associate dean of UT's 
Agricultural Extension Service; Harry Bryan, Knox County Extension 
Service; Gary Holiway, Jefferson County executive; Louis Buck, deputy 
commissioner of the state Department of Agriculture who brought greetings 
from Gov. Don Sundquist; Bob Jenkins, UT professor of fruit and vegetable 
marketing and owner of Highland View Orchard in Knoxville; Sue Cox, 
retired extension food marketing agent; Cheri Cruze of Cruze Farms; and 
Roger Dotson of Dotson Family Farms, which operates the Knox County 
Regional Farmers' Market.</p>
<p>Another speaker paying tribute was Steve Jones of Clinton, president of the 
Tennessee Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association, who noted that 
Louise's writing is always factual and accurate to the letter, adding:</p>
<p>``Whether it is about an innovative tomato grower in Grainger County who 
defies the odds or a scratch bakery in the heart of the Old City, her poetic 
portrayals always convey what's best about the people she writes about.</p>
<p>``Every time Louise puts her pen to paper (or I guess turns on the word 
processor, these days), she's paying tribute to the American way of life and 
the good people who pursue it. It is only fitting that we should all be together 
on this day in what I hope is only the prime of her writing career to show our 
appreciation, to pay tribute to a very special lady whose journalistic ability is 
only exceeded by Louise Durman, the person.''</p>
<p>Steve is right. Louise is special. And the good news is that last Sunday's 
event was a tribute to Louise, who is not retiring. And that is the best news 
to come out of Sunday's event.</p>

SITUATIONS </h2>
<p><em>By Harry Moskos, News-Sentinel Editor</em></p>
<p>Is there something amiss here or did I take a wrong turn somewhere along 
the way?</p>
<p>Three recent news stories reflect how things are different and probably not 
for the better.</p>
<p>NBC has apologized to China for remarks made by sports commentator 
Bob Costas during the network's coverage of the Olympics' opening 
ceremonies.</p>
<p>Costas had the audacity, according to China's state-run media and its foreign 
ministry, to say that every economic power including the United States wants 
to tap into China's huge potential market, ``but of course there are problems 
with human rights, property rights disputes, the threat posed to Taiwan.''</p>
<p>China objected, and an NBC vice president apologized for ``hurting the 
feelings'' of the Chinese groups upset over Costas' comments, adding that 
``Mr. Costas did not intend any disrespect to the People's Republic of China 
or its citizens.''</p>
<p>The apology seems odd since the three points mentioned by Costas are 
frequently brought up in discussions in Washington and elsewhere when 
China is the topic of conversation.</p>
<p>Of course, the complainers still are not happy because Costas himself did 
not apologize. We hope he doesn't.</p>
<p>Not apologizing soon enough got Stillwater, Okla., Police Sgt. John Jerkins 
in hot water -- and demoted to patrolman.</p>
<p>Jerkins, it seems, got up during the night in his house to guide his young 
nephew to the bathroom when he encountered his 17-year-old daughter and 
her 17-year-old boyfriend having sex on the couch.</p>
<p>Jerkins said he slapped the young man -- a typical reaction, most parents 
would think; but to Stillwater's city attorney, Mary Ann Karns, the police 
sergeant lost control and thus is ``at risk on the street.''</p>
<p>Jerkins and the city remained at odds for eight months until he apologized at 
an arbitration hearing two weeks ago. They are now discussing a settlement, 
whatever that means.</p>
<p>We actually like Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating's position on this matter. ``I 
would have slapped him a lot harder,'' the governor said.</p>
<p>And I offer no apologies at being at odds with another fad. Our Gary Lundy 
in a recent sports section story noted that the current in thing with University 
of Tennessee football players is to sport tattoos. Lundy mentioned 13 
specific players in his column but wrote that there were others besides those 
he interviewed.</p>
<p>Our sportswriters estimate that at least half of the football players now sport 
tattoos of some fashion and note that the fad also includes some of the 
women athletes.</p>
<p>I'm showing my age, but this sudden infatuation with decorating your body 
with all sorts of indelible doodlings leaves me cold. I guess that puts me in 
the same league with the father of one of the UT athletes who commented 
that he thought his son was destroying his body.</p>
<p>As one of my News-Sentinel colleague's commented, ``It's a different world 
out there today.''</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I predict that one of the fads in a decade or so will be laser 
surgery to have all those tattoos removed.</p>

<HEAD><TITLE>MEDIA DESERVED CRITICISM AT CONVENTIONS</TITLE>

<TD WIDTH=470><H2>MEDIA DESERVED CRITICISM AT CONVENTIONS</H2>

The news media came in for criticism - with some justification - for its coverage of the political conventions.<P>

   Rowland Nethaway, senior editor of the Waco, Texas, Tribune-Herald said that in 1992 the TV networks praised the strategy of the Democrats for a choreographed convention that prevented Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey from delivering a pro-life speech and muffled all liberals.<P>

   At that convention, Nethaway noted, ABC's Jim Wooten was ecstatic that not a liberal was in sight since it left the impression wanted by Bill Clinton that the Democrats were centrist.<P>

   By contrast, Nethaway added, Wooten said this year's Republican convention was ``craftily designed for a broadcast image of tolerance and diversity that's starkly at odds with reality.''<P>

   Other network stars were effusive with their praise of the tightly controlled and carefully scripted 1992 Democratic convention but outraged for the same reasons at the 1996 Republican convention, Nethaway said.<P>

   We came in for our share of criticism, too.<P>

   Several readers complained about a front-page headline declaring that, ``First lady electrifies Demos, refutes Republican critics.'' They thought the use of the word ``refutes'' was editorializing. They were right. We should have used the word ``rebuts,'' ``disputes'' or ``answers.''<P>

   And readers also critically noted that on one day during the Republican convention we featured a front-page picture of a minor protest outside the convention arena while relegating the convention's news pictures to an inside page.<P>

   Some callers thought the networks let Vice President Al Gore's remarks at the Democratic convention go unchallenged, such as saying the Clinton administration had put 100,000 new police officers on the street.<P>

   The figure is actually closer to only 12,000.<P>

   The Justice Department released figures showing that the program increased the nation's police forces by no more than 3percent, and, according to the New Citizenship Project, it is doubtful that such a small number of officers has had an influence in a declining crime rate as claimed by the Clinton administration.<P>

   Michael Hedges of the Scripps Howard News Service reported earlier that dozens of cities have declined to participate in the program because the cities - not the federal government - wind up paying most of the costs in hiring new police officers.<P>

   The national media took great pains to project that the Democrats were taking the high road at their convention.<P>

   TV and radio commentators were quick to note that Gore had referred to Bob Dole as a ``good and decent man'' and even praised the Republican presidential nominee for his life's work -- that was just 24 hours after the vice president referred to Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich as a ``two-headed monster.''<P>

   The networks failed to pick up on that point, too.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>VIOLENT JUVENILE CRIME NOW THE NORM</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><a href="/"><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="A Knoxville News-Sentinel Online product" border=0></a></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>September 15, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>VIOLENT JUVENILE CRIME NOW THE NORM</H2>

It is very disconcerting to read that the Knox County grand jury has returned murder indictments against 14individuals.<P>

   That alone is bad news.<P>

   It is really bad news when you read further and realize that exactly half of those indicted are teenagers, including two who are just 15years old, another two who are only 16 and still two more who are 17. The seventh is 19.<P>

   Of the other seven who were indicted, two were teenagers when the slaying they are accused of committing occurred.<P>

   In addition, the grand jury returned indictments of attempted first-degree murder on two additional teenagers.<P>

   Violent juvenile crime is no longer the exception to the rule. It is now  the norm. To date this year, 22 Knox County juveniles have had their cases transferred to Criminal Court, compared with a previous record of six in a single year.<P>

   All of this paints a bleak picture as the American judicial system seeks an answer to the spiraling crime problem involving kids.<P>

   The U.S. Justice Department earlier this year noted that the major increases in crime will come from those in the 10- to 17-year-old age group. The murder rate in this country among those between 14 and 17 years old has more than doubled in the last 10 years.<P>

   The statistics also show that this crime pattern among young people parallels an increasing use of drugs by juveniles. Recent government reports show a 105percent increase in drug use among teenagers along with an increase in visits to hospitals by juveniles for drug-related emergencies.<P>

   U.S. Sen Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., in a recent Knoxville speech noted the seriousness of juvenile violence by pointing out that the children of today are doing more damage to this country than any foreign nation.<P>

   ``We've come to the point now where we can no longer afford the natural consequences of our law-and-order rhetoric. We've got to do more, and we've got to do better.''<P>

   The senator added that there are 161 federal programs aimed at stopping juvenile crime but that crimes committed by juveniles continue to soar.<P>

   In the latest round of Knox County indictments, at least four of the seven teenagers were indicted in cases that had a link to drugs.<P>

   The drug abuse survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that drug use among 12- to 17-year-olds rose 105 percent from 1992 to 1995. The survey also showed that teenage use of LSD and other hallucinogens, cocaine and marijuana all increased in alarming proportions since the start of this decade.<P>

   Knoxville authorities have expressed concern over the emergence of gangs over the past few years. Now adjacent Sevier County is experiencing the same problem with authorities there seeing gang activity that is linked with Knoxville's two main inner-city gangs. Officials in neighboring Jefferson County also note an increase in juvenile criminals -- both younger and more violent.<P>

   As Sen. Thompson noted, ``nobody's got the answers'' to dealing with juvenile crime, but we all know it is a very real and serious problem. <P>

<p><!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Dateline Here--><br>
<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>I</font>n 1988, author Gail Sheehy came out with a thought-provoking book 
titled ''Character,'' which took a comprehensive look at the character of six 
candidates seeking the presidential nomination that year. </p>
<p>Her book came to mind this past week when on one day three separate 
stories on the Associated Press news wire brought the character issue into 
focus. </p>
<p>The first story reported that a grand jury in Washington, D.C., had indicted 
lobbyist Jack L. Williams about his and Tyson Foods Inc.'s role in providing 
favors directly to former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy while a member 
of President Clinton's Cabinet -- and through Espy's girlfriend. The 
indictment charges that Williams lied to federal investigators. </p>
<p>The investigation involves several companies that are affected by Agriculture 
Department regulations in which Espy, his girlfriend, and others close to 
Espy benefitted. One other lobbyist already has pleaded guilty to making 
illegal contributions. </p>
<p>The second story, this one from Lubbock, Texas, also involved another of 
the president's Cabinet appointments. The story reported that FBI agents, 
after a 12-hour search, took five boxes from the home of Housing Secretary 
Henry Cisneros' one-time mistress. </p>
<p>An independent counsel is investigating whether Cisneros lied to the FBI 
during his background check for his nomination about his payments to Linda 
Medlar. </p>
<p>The third story, involving another Clinton appointment, quoted congressional 
investigators as saying that the Agriculture Department's undersecretary in 
charge of the federal school lunch program overstepped rules designed to 
keep public officials from using their office to help friends. </p>
<p>It seems Undersecretary Ellen Haas got involved in a friend's $25,000 
government grant to write a children's book on nutrition. Auditors noted that 
Haas neglected to tell ethics officers of her 15-year friendship with the 
author and pressured the department's Food and Consumer Service to 
make an early purchase of the book. </p>
<p>Character was a big issue in the 1988 election. This year, it is a subject that 
for some reason fails to move the dial one iota on the interest meter of the 
electorate. </p>
<p>Espy, Cisneros and Haas certainly are not the first FOBs (Friends of Bill) to 
be involved in the issue of character during this administration. Webster 
Hubbell, Craig Livingstone and Dick Morris are three more names that 
come to mind quickly. </p>
<p>One journalist noted recently that ethics investigations of the Clintons and 
their aides are costing taxpayers more than $1million per month. </p>
<p>In her book, Sheehy wrote: ''At this point in our political history, however, 
the concentration on character issues is unparalleled in its intensity.'' </p>
<p>How things have changed in only eight years. Why we, as a nation, are not 
interested in character and ethics is setting a dangerous precedent for future 
generations. </p>

<p><!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Dateline Here--><br>
<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>I</font>t is tough being a teacher. </p>
<p>The goal is to educate, but frequently educators must confront other issues 
that to their chagrin focuses more on discipline than curriculum. The system 
works against the classroom teacher. </p>
<p>In New York, the state's appeals court ruled Sept. 17 that a 15-year-old 
student should not have been suspended from school for carrying a loaded 
handgun. The student had been suspended after a security guard, who saw a 
bulge in the teenager's pocket, found the loaded gun. </p>
<p>A judge ruled the guard conducted an ''unreasonable search,'' and the 
appeals court agreed, also ordering school officials to expunge all references 
to the suspension. </p>
<p>The New York schools intend to appeal because the ruling for the first time 
held the schools to the same standards as prosecutors in criminal trials. </p>
<p>Ironically, just one week after the New York court in effect gave the green 
light for students to pack loaded guns, a teacher at a Decatur, Ga., 
alternative school was fatally shot in his classroom by a teenage student who 
fired five bullets into the teacher as horrified students watched. </p>
<p>In Oklahoma City, two 16-year-old boys were charged last week in the 
abduction, rape and shotgun slaying of a 15-year-old schoolmate. The two 
boys were described as students with serious disciplinary problems but were 
allowed to remain in school. </p>
<p>Those events may seem remote from Knoxville, but a recent News-Sentinel 
story reported that troubled teens, including those charged with murder and 
classified as unredeemable by the juvenile court system, could well be in a 
typical classroom. </p>
<p>At least a half dozen Knoxville school age juveniles, who have been charged 
with murder and released from adult jails after posting bond, should be back 
in school because they are juveniles. In Tennessee, children under the age of 
18 must be provided an education. </p>
<p>American public schools are in a unique position. They must educate 
students at all spectrums of the learning bell from the top to the bottom of the 
academic curve. Thus students at both ends of that curve can become 
bored, creating problems in the classroom. </p>
<p>Whether it is students charged with serious crimes or simply free spirits 
making ridiculous statements with blue Mohawk haircuts or challenging dress 
codes, the teachers are caught in the middle. They seek to instill knowledge 
while trying to keep boredom and rebellious students from taking over the 
classroom. It is not an easy task. </p>
<p>One would hope that parents would support teachers in creating a proper 
learning environment in the classroom, but what seems like little challenges to 
authority turn out to be major expenses in time and effort; most of all, it is 
time lost on teaching. </p>

<p>The Knoxville Academy of Medicine hopes to give at least 15,000 free flu 
vaccine shots on Saturday, Oct. 19. </p>
<p>The occasion is the fifth year of the Flu Shot Saturday campaign started by 
Dr. Charles Barnett in 1992 and officially taken over by the academy in 
1994. </p>
<p>The purpose of the campaign is to urge people to protect themselves during 
the flu season and at the same time help The Knoxville News-Sentinel's 
Empty Stocking Fund. </p>
<p>The Empty Stocking Fund, started in 1912, provides food baskets and toys 
to 3,500 families at Christmas time. Each food basket is valued at $50, and 
toys are given to more than 3,000 children. </p>
<p>The flu shots are free, but donations to the charity are indeed welcomed. </p>
<p>A person going to a doctor's office for a flu shot would pay between $15 
and $20. </p>
<p>Last year there were more than 11,500 flu shots given with almost $53,000 
received in donations for an average donation of about $4.60 per shot. </p>
<p>The program started with one site in its first two years, but expanded to 10 
sites in 1994 and to 19 last year. This year there will be 22 locations 
providing the shots with a goal of reaching at least 15,000 people. </p>
<p>More than 350 volunteers turn out on Flu Shot Saturday including doctors, 
nurses and technicians. In addition, members of the academy donate about 
$30,000 every year to pay the cost of obtaining the flu vaccine. </p>
<p>The influenza season in the United States generally lasts from November to 
April. Although most people are ill for only a few days, the viral infection can 
be much more serious to others. </p>
<p>Dr. Robert Overholt, president of the academy's foundation, which 
administers the flu shot program, says between 10,000 and 20,000 people 
in the United States die every year from influenza or related complications, 
adding, ''We sincerely hope that none of those deaths are in this area 
because of the protection through immunization.'' </p>
<p>The shots are available for those 3 years old and up. The flu vaccine no 
longer gives people a mild case of the flu. For children under 3, however, 
parents should contact their family physician or pediatrician, and those 
allergic to eggs should not receive the flu vaccine. </p>
<p>''The Knoxville Academy of Medicine feels the free flu vaccine program is 
the best service that we provide the public,'' Overholt said. ''We feel this 
way because we are providing services to help people without charging and 
that makes everybody feel good.'' </p>
<p>Overholt explained that the true, warm feeling comes from not only providing 
the immunizations free, but also seeing people respond in giving donations to 
the Empty Stocking Fund. </p>
<p>''People stay healthy, while the unfortunate are fed.'' </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">D</font>ennis Reed is a black Knoxville
        businessman. He was born in Morristown and received a
        B.A. in sociology from Carson-Newman College in Jefferson
        City. </p>
        <p>His friends call him ''D,'' and he's noted for
        expressing his opinion, wanting to ''stir it up,'' and
        then asking those listening to ''think about it.'' </p>
        <p>During a recent visit to The News-Sentinel, ''D''
        outlined his views on a variety of topics: </p>
        <p>* Welfare: ''Hail to the chief for signing the welfare
        reform bill. For a member of a minority, my position is
        not popular. Welfare has had a negative unwanted result
        as well as feeding the poor. Welfare was created to give
        a helping hand. For three decades it has become a
        paycheck. Too many generations have become dependent on
        it. Too many people will not work. A young married man
        with two children and another one on the way asked me for
        money. I told him I did not have it to lend but I would
        give him a job. He got an attitude and called me
        stingy.'' </p>
        <p>Lottery: ''Every six months or so I will drive the
        50miles to another state to sin. I will spend $5 to buy a
        lottery ticket with a slim chance to win $50million. The
        drive and the scenery are nice, too. Georgia provides
        free college to those who maintain a B average,
        compliments of a lottery. We need to stop supporting
        Georgia, Missouri, Mississippi, Virginia and Kentucky
        economies.'' </p>
        <p>* Bingo: ''If I pay or donate to get a bingo card and
        win a bingo game that pays me money, then that's
        gambling. Bingo! Why did it take over a year's investigation
        by state and local authorities to figure that out? Won't
        you sleep better knowing no one is yelling 'bingo'
        tonight? Are you a member of any country club in
        Tennessee? Those gin rummy games are played for fun and
        recreation. Those foursomes on the golf course pay off in
        toothpicks after 18 holes. Did state officials go to the
        golf courses statewide? Oh, yeah. I saw one playing golf
        the other day. He won 20 toothpicks.'' </p>
        <p>* Identification: ''A young man from Washington, D.C.,
        addressed me as an African-American. My response was that
        I am not an African-American, but I am a black American
        with some African descent. He was insulted and said I was
        denying my heritage. I asked the young man where a German-American
        is from? An Italian-American? A Japanese-American? Yes,
        Germany, Italy and Japan are countries. Africa is a
        continent. Tell me if I came from Uganda, Ethiopia or
        Egypt. Identify the country and I will accept that, but
        do not identify me by a continent.'' </p>
        <p>* Quotas: ''People should be hired based on
        qualifications, not race. If there can be a quota for me,
        then there can be a quota for you. To deny some type of a
        helping hand is to imply that racism does not exist. I am
        a member of a minority that knows racism will always
        exist. There is a difference in setting aside a certain
        number of jobs because of race and giving a helping hand
        in attaining these jobs based on qualifications.'' </p>
        <p>* Racism: ''Racism and hatred are here to stay.
        Opportunities exist. Blacks have to stop blaming whites
        and take the opportunities that present themselves and
        also create their own opportunities. A person can be who or
        what he wishes if he has the drive and perseverance to
        keep on pushing.'' </p>
        <p>* Southern heritage: ''I was born and raised in the
        South. Southern heritage is one thing, but if some of it
        negatively affects a particular group or race, it should
        be abolished as a pep song (''Dixie'') or rallying point
        (Confederate flag).'' </p>
        <p>* Safety: ''There is something becoming a most serious
        problem on our highways. Get those cellular phones off
        the road. You cannot drive and talk on the phone at the
        same time.'' </p>
        <p>* Religion: ''I believe God judges us by how we treat
        our fellow man and environment. Do we love and respect?
        Do we follow the Golden Rule?'' </p>
        <p>As ''D'' says, ''Think about it!'' </p>

<p><!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Dateline Here--><br>
<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>T</font>he state Legislature's plan to take politics out of the selection of judges 
has turned out to be one big political mess. </p>
<p>If anything, the turning over of the selection process of new judges to a 
15-member Judicial Selection Commission has only increased the political 
activity. </p>
<p>Now potential candidates lobby the commission either directly or through 
intermediaries. The commission provides the governor with the names of 
three finalists from which the governor is to select the new judge or justice. It 
is only logical to assume that the governor is then lobbied by the three 
finalists and their friends. </p>
<p>If the governor, by chance, is unhappy with the three names on the list, he 
can ask for another -- and final -- list of three names. That is a gamble, 
however, since the commission could conceivably send the governor a 
weaker list of finalists. </p>
<p>The commission can also stack the list. Hypothetically, the commission could 
come up with one candidate it has selected as its inside choice and provide 
names of two other candidates who are unlikely to be seriously considered. </p>
<p>The selection of the commission is interesting, too. The commission is 
appointed by the speaker of the House and the Senate president, two of the 
more powerful political figures in the state. </p>
<p>Knox County, the state's third largest county, has no representation on the 
commission. Only three are from East Tennessee. The other 12 are from 
Middle and West Tennessee. </p>
<p>The confusion started Aug. 1 when Justice Penny White became the first 
judge on the appellate level or higher in Tennessee to lose a yes-no 
referendum. </p>
<p>The fuss over the vacancy has been a tragic comedy of court decisions, one 
overruling another and, in the latest, a lower court overruling a special state 
Supreme Court. The real state Supreme Court, minus White, last week 
finally decided to use its authority to settle the dispute over who is eligible to 
fill White's seat. </p>
<p>As one Knoxville judge commented, there is so much confusion that he 
would not want to be considered for such an appointment. Undoubtedly, this 
procedure will keep many good candidates from wanting to apply for 
judgeships in the future for fear they could become victims of this 
foolishness. </p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Jimmy Duncan has suggested that the governor should appoint the 
judges and let them stand for state Senate confirmation. If the citizens are not 
happy, they can hold the governor responsible by voting the governor </p>
<p>and/or the judge out of office. Another suggestion has been for the governor 
to appoint and then let the voters decide on a yes-no vote at the next 
scheduled election. </p>
<p>The current method, however, has been to keep the public out of the judicial 
selection process and to leave the governor with only a minor role. The 
system was changed by a then-Democratic-controlled legislature just before 
it seemed apparent that the Republicans were going to take over the 
governorship. </p>
<p>The system to select Tennessee justices and judges has become not only 
political but also very chaotic. It is not something the state's judicial system 
or its citizens deserve. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">H</font>ats off to the Knoxville Academy
        of Medicine for another successful Flu Shot Saturday. </p>
        <p>Its annual free flu shot campaign a week ago yesterday
        provided flu vaccine to nearly 17,500 people and raised
        $78,000 in donations for The Knoxville News-Sentinel's
        Empty Stocking Fund charity that provides food baskets and
        toys to 3,500 families. In addition, the fund provides
        6,000 meals during the holiday season through the
        Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee's Meals
        on Wheels program. </p>
        <p>It's a win-win situation for all. Those participating
        receive a flu shot, and those desiring can make a
        donation to the Empty Stocking Fund, which uses the money
        to help those not as fortunate. </p>
        <p>As it was said reflectively by Dr. Robert Overholt,
        ''People stay healthy, while the unfortunate are fed.''
        Dr. Overholt is president of the Academy's Foundation,
        which sponsors the flu shot program. </p>
        <p>Flu Shot Saturday is a tremendous team effort
        involving about 700 volunteers in the health-care
        profession including physicians, nurses, technicians and
        others. In addition, First Tennessee Bank provided volunteers
        to help collect the donations. And many co-workers from
        all departments in The News-Sentinel also volunteered
        their time. </p>
        <p>In addition, all the flu vaccine, which cost $30,000,
        was donated entirely by member physicians of the
        Knoxville Academy of Medicine. </p>
        <p>All of the money raised goes directly to help others
        since the three charities run by The News-Sentinel do not
        have any salaries or operating costs. Any money donated
        to the Empty Stocking Fund, the Milk Fund or the Mercy Fund
        is used to help others without any funds being
        sidetracked for administrative costs. This is a factor
        that makes all of us at The News-Sentinel proud of the
        citizen involvement in the charities. </p>
        <p>This year, the Academy provided 17,483 flu vaccine
        shots compared with 11,500 last year. Contributions this
        year were up $25,000 from last year's $53,000. While both
        the number of shots and contributions increased, the average
        donation dropped slightly. Last year the average donation
        was $4.60 compared with $4.46 this year. </p>
        <p>This pattern seems to fit with a national trend which
        shows charities are receiving more in donations from a
        smaller pool of contributors. </p>
        <p>A study by the Gallup Organization reported that
        Americans who gave to charity contributed an average of
        10percent more last year than in 1993, but more
        households gave nothing. </p>
        <p>An Associated Press story on the Gallup study noted
        that 69percent of those surveyed said that their
        households gave to charity last year, down from 73percent
        who said they gave in 1993. </p>
        <p>The survey also showed that volunteering is up with
        93million Americans donating 20billion hours of their
        time in 1995, a billion hours more than in 1993. </p>
        <p>The number of volunteers involved in Flu Shot Saturday
        is a testimony to that fact. </p>
        <p>Flu Shot Saturday is a wonderful example of charity
        involving donations in both time and money. We want to
        give our special appreciation to the Knoxville Academy of
        Medicine and all the other wonderful volunteers who gave
        up their Saturday to help. And, of course, our
        appreciation to those who not only got their inoculations
        but also made a donation to the Empty Stocking Fund. </p>
        <p>Thank you! </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">D</font>r. R.W. Bevington, senior pastor
        of Knoxville Baptist Tabernacle, wrote a letter to say he
        read with ''great satisfaction'' the editorial of Oct. 20 in
        which The News-Sentinel and 15 other Scripps Howard
        newspapers endorsed Bob Dole for president. </p>
        <p>Bevington went on to write: </p>
        <p>''Four years ago I wrote a letter to you following
        your paper's endorsement of George Bush for the same
        office. In a correlative article you explained how
        Scripps Howard editors met, voted collectively on the man
        they preferred for the presidency, then all of the
        company-owned papers carried the same endorsement. </p>
        <p>''The Oct. 20 editorial was factual and beautifully
        written. Did this year's procedure follow that of 1992?'' </p>
        <p>Yes, the same procedure was used. </p>
        <p>The editors of 16 Scripps Howard newspapers met as a
        group, along with the company's top news executives, to
        discuss the candidates and the issues. By a three-to-one
        margin, the editors and news executives voted to endorse
        the Dole-Kemp ticket over the Clinton-Gore ticket.
        Knoxville voted with the majority. There were no votes
        for Ross Perot or any of the other minor party
        candidates. </p>
        <p>The presidential endorsement procedure is the one time
        Scripps Howard editors change the pattern in endorsing
        candidates or supporting local issues, such as the
        question of unification of the Knoxville and Knox County governments. </p>
        <p>Endorsements at the local level are left to the
        individual editors to decide. When it comes to picking a
        candidate for governor, U.S. Senate, legislative races or
        the local mayor, the editor is the final authority. Of
        course, the process includes discussions with the
        editorial page staff, newsroom managers and reporters
        involved in covering a specific campaign or issue. </p>
        <p>In endorsing a candidate for president of the United
        States, however, Scripps Howard speaks with one voice. At
        a meeting held in Cincinnati, location of Scripps Howard
        corporate headquarters, the issues were discussed and
        then the vote taken. All abide with the majority vote. </p>
        <p>The editorial, which Bevington praised, was written by
        Jay Ambrose, chief editorial writer of the Scripps Howard
        News Service in Washington, D.C. Ambrose listened to the
        points raised by editors in expressing their opinions and
        then concisely wrapped it up in the editorial. </p>
        <p>The Rev. Mr. Bevington concluded his letter by
        writing, ''Your motto is 'Give light and the people will
        find their own way.' You have given light. I pray the
        people will walk in it.'' </p>
        <p>We'll find out on Tuesday. </p>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->        <font size="5">N</font>otes on an election campaign that
        seemed to last forever: </p>
        <p>Early voting is great. It saves a lot of time by
        letting voters cast their ballots early. More than 44,000
        Knox County citizens took advantage of voting early.
        That's 22 percent of the county's registered voters. Knox
        County voting totaled 63 percent, which topped the
        state's 60 percent turnout and was far better than the 49
        percent that turned out nationally. The national turnout
        was the lowest in 72 years. The only hitch with early
        voting is to get the tabulating system working properly. </p>
        <p>While the local turnout was impressive, one could
        wonder if the turnout nationally would improve with
        Election Day being on a Saturday, which is the procedure
        followed by many foreign countries. It just seems that it would
        be easier to vote on a Saturday, thus resulting in a
        higher participation by the citizens in selecting our
        officeholders. A 49 percent turnout is shameful. </p>
        <p>It is too bad we cannot divide America into just two
        time zones -- one east of the Mississippi and another
        west. This would set a uniform time for voting, thus
        avoiding the dilemma faced by the TV networks when it
        comes to calling the presidential election early. Every
        four years the issue comes up whether voters in the West
        will stay home if they already know who has won based on
        results from eastern states. By merging the Pacific and Mountain
        time zones into one and the Central and Eastern time
        zones into another, we could come up with a uniform
        voting time of 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in the East and 7 a.m. to
        7 p.m. in the West. Thus the networks would only have to
        worry about waiting the one hour until the polls closed
        in Hawaii and Alaska. It might be easier, though, to
        encourage all states to adopt early voting. </p>
        <p>The Knox County schools get a gold star for planning
        ahead by making Election Day an in-service day, thus
        avoiding crowds of students and voters vying for the same
        parking spaces. </p>
        <p>Who comes up with a candidate's schedule? The
        Republicans had their presidential candidate hold a rally
        in Knoxville on the eve of the election at a nightclub
        where a few months earlier federal agents seized bank
        records and cash register tapes looking for evidence of
        money laundering, interstate transportation of stolen
        property and tax evasion. </p>
        <p>As campaigns get mean-spirited and more negative, it
        seems that office holders soon will become reluctant to
        ever vote on anything for fear a vote will come back to
        haunt them in the future. It seems local legislators get stamped
        with misleading tax-and-spend labels because at some time
        they voted to support some county's plan to levy a wheel
        tax or some such local revenue-producing plan. I recall
        that the governor let some such bills become law without
        his signature this past legislative session, perhaps to avoid
        such a label in a future election. </p>
        <p>Dirty tricksters were at work in the unification
        election. Opponents to unification placed phony placards
        in News-Sentinel newspaper racks on election day reading,
        ''Unification Predicted to Fail Today!'' The sign implied
        such a story was in the paper that day when no such story
        existed. News-Sentinel circulation department crews went
        around town removing the posters. The anonymous person
        behind the sign, however, turned out to be more accurate
        than the pollsters. </p>
        <p>This state really will be a battleground in the year
        2000 if it turns out that the presidential campaign is
        between two Tennesseans, Al Gore and Sen. Fred Thompson
        or former governor Lamar Alexander. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">T</font>he photograph in The
        News-Sentinel's Neighbors section of Master Firefighter
        Neal Solomon latching the hood of the Knoxville Fire Department's
        newest tanker truck caught my attention. </p>
        <p>The caption under the picture noted that the city had
        replaced 96percent of its firefighting equipment and
        other vehicles in the past nine years. </p>
        <p>That, I considered, was a remarkable accomplishment. </p>
        <p>Fire Chief Bruce Cureton confirmed this when he noted
        that all the new equipment included 29 pieces of
        firefighting apparatus with a value of nearly $4.8million.
        The new equipment ranges from pumpers and ladder trucks
        to rescue and hazardous material vehicles. </p>
        <p>This updating of firefighting equipment leaves the
        city with only five fire trucks of the 1975 vintage, and
        two of them are to be replaced next year. The remaining
        three are scheduled for replacement in 1998. </p>
        <p>This upgrading of the Fire Department's resources
        reflects Mayor Victor Ashe's and Chief Cureton's
        commitment to modernize the department in all facets from
        equipment to training. </p>
        <p>In the 11 years prior to Ashe being sworn in as mayor
        on Jan, 1, 1988, the city had not hired a single
        firefighter. Since then, 143 firefighters have been hired,
        increasing the size of the department to 359 from its
        previous high of 323. </p>
        <p>In addition, four new fire stations have been built
        since 1988 at a total cost of $2.7million. </p>
        <p>It is, however, the training and added services,
        especially the department's First Responder program, that
        draws the most enthusiasm from Cureton. </p>
        <p>Fifty-two percent of the department's calls are those
        seeking first aid or medical assistance from First
        Responder units. The First Responder program was resumed
        in 1993 after being discontinued before Ashe's election. </p>
        <p>All crews on fire engines now include firefighters
        trained as emergency medical technicians, and nine of the
        engines have been upgraded to advanced life support (ALS)
        units staffed with paramedics. Two more units will be
        upgraded to ALS status early next year, and eventually
        every fire engine in the city will be staffed with at
        least one paramedic. </p>
        <p>Cureton encourages continuing education and noted that
        more firefighters now have college degrees than ever
        before. </p>
        <p>All Knoxville firefighters receive at least 40hours of
        in-service training annually, and certification includes
        training in firefighting, handling hazardous materials,
        auto extrication and emergency medical assistance. </p>
        <p>As the city upgrades its equipment, it finds a new use
        for its old fire trucks -- leasing them at $1 a year to
        smaller communities in the state that cannot afford to
        purchase new equipment. The Knoxville Fire Department has provided
        fire trucks to 13 such communities in the state extending
        from Shelbyville in the west to Kodak in the east. </p>
        <p>While Cureton had the vision to improve the department
        and the mayor and City Council provided the needed
        support, it is the citizens who are the winners. </p>

		<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>hanksgiving is always the appropriate time to reflect on those who earn a special note of appreciation for their thoughtfulness during the year whether it is for a special act of kindness and decency or for heroic actions.
<P>   We are fortunate as a community to have many who earned gold stars for their actions, which is a standard we all should seek.
<P>   Janice and Jerry Lewis of Chattanooga showed what honesty is about when they found the wallet of Boyd Thrasher of Knoxville. The wallet contained $12,000 in crisp, new $100 bills that Thrasher had intended to use to buy a car. Thrasher had to convince Janice and Jerry to even accept a reward.
<P>   Dorothy Carroll of Knoxville is thankful for an honest stranger who tracked her down after she lost an envelope containing $100. The hero, who never left her name, tracked down Dorothy by going through the phone book until she found the right person.
<P>   We have our share of heroic teenagers, too.
<P>   * Fourteen-year-old Antoine Watkins rushed into a smoke-filled home to rescue a 41-year-old woman who was overcome by the smoke.
<P>   * Fifteen-year-old Shawn Watts awoke to find the family house afire and alerted his family. All four members of the Watts family and their two cats escaped without injury from the fire, started by a short in the motor of a fan, because of Shawn&#39;s quick action.
<P>   * Six-year-old Alyssa Williams saved the life of her father, Stan Williams, after he suffered an epileptic seizure that rendered him unconscious while swimming in four feet of water. The 52-pound Alyssa pulled her 260-pound father to the stairs at the shallow end of the pool and raised his head to keep his face out of the water.
<P>   E-911 dispatchers routinely work under pressure, but that still doesn&#39;t keep them from earning hero status. Such is the case with Shannon Davis who helped Emily Keener revive a 3-year-old who fell out of a flotation device and into a swimming pool. Davis calmly gave Kenner instructions over the phone as an ambulance rushed to the scene.
<P>   Just this past week, E-911 dispatcher Ray Faircloth, also using the phone, guided Marcia Johnson in deliverying a neighbor&#39;s baby. As the ambulance arrived, Johnson was just getting ready to cut the umbilical cord. Both mother, Yvonne Williams, and son, Tomas Olsey Williams III, checked out fine at Baptist Hospital.
<P>   Off-duty nurse Robin Brown was shopping when she heard &#39;&#39;this horrible crash.&#39;&#39; Dropping her purse, she rushed out of the store and immediately provided lifesaving aid to one of the injured in a two-car collision on Campbell Station Road. Brown opened the victim&#39;s airway to restore his breathing and then assisted paramedics after they arrived.
<P>   Oak Ridge residents Robert Luttrell, Richard Girtain and Bruce Webb pulled an unconscious man from behind the wheel of his burning car just as the interior of the vehicle burst into flames.
<P>   Angela Stafford, an employee at the Budget Inns of America at 6101 Kingston Pike, discovered a fire at the motel. She immediately ran to the motel office to alert the manager and then began rousting people from their rooms. Occupants of 60 rooms were guided to safety, and Stafford also rescued two cats from one room.
<P>   Federal Express courier B.J. Beeler was making deliveries when he noticed a fire in an apartment complex on Laurel Avenue. Beeler called for help on his cellular phone and then went door to door warning people to get out.
<P>   And a special thanks to one of our own. News-Sentinel carrier Jeannie Barker&#39;s vigilance saved the life of an 87-year-old subscriber who lay helpless on his kitchen floor after falling and breaking his hip. Barker noticed that the man had not picked up his paper from the previous day. When she called his residence and got no answer, Barker telephoned for help. Firefighters found the injured man after entering the house.
<P>   Happy Thanksgiving to all, but especially to all those heroes and heroines who give us a special reason to reflect on the meaning of this holiday.

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">I</font> finally have found a point on
        which I can agree with Champion International and its
        position toward a cleaner Pigeon River. </p>
        <p>''We need to go further,'' the company said in a
        recent news release. </p>
        <p>Champion's relationship with this newspaper got off to
        a rocky start about 10years ago when one of its
        executives visited our newsroom and stated flatly there
        was nothing more that Champion could do regarding
        cleaning the river. The only alternative, he threatened,
        was to shut down the paper mill and lay everyone off. </p>
        <p>Time has shown that both statements were deliberate
        falsehoods. </p>
        <p>Champion's new acknowledgement that it must do more at
        its Canton, N.C., plant, however, does not diminish the
        importance of Tennessee holding firm to its objections
        over Champion's application for discharging wastes from
        its mill at its current level into the Pigeon River. </p>
        <p>The U.S. Public Interest Research Group analyzed the
        federal Toxics Release Inventory from 1990 through 1994
        and found that the Pigeon River received 1.3million
        pounds of toxic water pollution during the five-year period.
        The study cited Champion as the single largest polluter
        in North Carolina during that period. </p>
        <p>Champion has been issued a variance by North Carolina
        that allows it to continue present levels of discharges
        from its Canton paper mill into the Pigeon. The
        Environmental Protection Agency will not get involved
        unless Tennessee objects. Tennessee went to federal court
        in 1985 charging that North Carolina was not properly
        enforcing the Clean Water Act, and the judge ruled in
        Tennessee's favor by granting permitting authority to the
        EPA. </p>
        <p>Gov. Don Sundquist and the state's environment and
        conservation commissioner, Justin Wilson, do object, and
        we applaud their strong stand in supporting those who
        believe Champion needs to take even stronger steps to
        clean up the Pigeon River, which flows into Douglas Lake
        and eventually into the Tennessee River. </p>
        <p>Commissioner Wilson succinctly summarized Tennessee's
        position by saying, ''I looked at the river, and the
        river was just not acceptable.'' </p>
        <p>Champion likes to boast that it has spent more than
        $330million in new technology at its Canton mill, but
        most of it has been for plant modernization and not
        necessarily directly connected to improvements in the
        quality of the river. </p>
        <p>One key item to monitoring the discharge from the mill
        into the Pigeon River would be to test samples at the
        national standard of one-quarter mile downriver from the
        mill and not at the current collection point some 35 miles
        downstream. </p>
        <p>North Carolina has issued a variance to Champion that
        does nothing to improve the quality of the water flowing
        into Tennessee. This state and its citizens are right in
        seeking improvements, a battle that has been going on since
        1908. </p>
        <p>Yes, Champion International needs to go further. Much
        further. The water below the mill should be as clean as
        the water above the mill. </p>

<P>   Remember Joe Gehrke? He is the maverick Stanton, Mich., judge who literally slapped a man on the wrist for spouse abuse. Well, you won&#39;t have to remember him anymore. The Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission had accused Gehrke of misconduct and wanted him suspended. The voters, however, acted first and cast him out of office last month by giving his opponent two-thirds of the vote.
<P>   Politicos do have short memories. Vice President Al Gore came to town Sept. 6 pledging the Clinton administrations&#39;s continued support of Oak Ridge as a research complex while charging that Bob Dole would turn Oak Ridge into a ghost town. Just two weeks after the election it was announced that 10 percent of the Department of Energy&#39;s contractor work force at Oak Ridge facilities will get pink slips within the next 10 months. Bet there are more layoffs after that, too.
<P>   Several readers have chided us over our wedding announcements, which often say something such as, &#39;&#39;the couple are at home after a honeymoon to Hawaii.&#39;&#39; The critics say it should read that the &#39;&#39;couple is at home.&#39;&#39; Two sources say &#39;&#39;are&#39;&#39; is correct. The Associated Press stylebook says when couple is used in the sense of two people, the word takes plural verbs and pronouns. Don Ferguson, who writes the weekly &#39;&#39;Grammar Gremlins&#39;&#39; feature in The News-Sentinel, also says &#39;&#39;are&#39;&#39; is correct, noting that the use of &#39;&#39;couple&#39;&#39; can cause a problem because it is a singular noun that often takes a plural verb.
<P>   The Henley Street Connector is a real plus for getting in and out of downtown Knoxville, but we wish the traffic engineers would synchronize the traffic signals on streets feeding into Henley Street. When the light is red for the traffic on Clinch Avenue feeding into Henley Street, the light is green one block east on Clinch at Locust Street. When the light at Henley turns green for the Clinch traffic to move, it turns red for the traffic on Clinch at Locust, which means gridlock. The timing of the signals needs to be checked on Cumberland Avenue, which has the same problem, as well.
<P>   Someone in Medford, Ore., didn&#39;t wait for the traffic engineers to act. A 20-foot-long asphalt speed bump mysteriously appeared on Wabash Avenue after residents began complaining about speeders. Medford officials immediately dispatched crews to chisel away the asphalt as residents looked on. One grumbled, &#39;&#39;It takes 6 months to get a pothole filled but less than 24 hours for them to remove something that may do some good.&#39;&#39;
<P>   We&#39;ll end on a seasonal note. Bloomberg Business News reports that the costs of the goods and services listed in the Christmas carol &#39;&#39;The Twelve Days of Christmas&#39;&#39; rose to $13,195.86, an increase of 5.72 percent over last year. The increase is not because of the pear tree, which held steady at $15, or the gold rings, which remained unchanged at $325, but labor costs for the eight maids-a-milking, nine ladies dancing, 11 pipers piping and 12 drummers drumming. The 10 lords-a-leaping remained the same since their wage increase at the Philadelphia Dance Company, used in the comparison study, isn&#39;t effective until January.

		<FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT>ederal Judge John T. Nixon of Nashville has done it again.
<P>   The judge overturned the conviction and death sentence of a man who raped and murdered an 8-year-old Greenfield girl in 1979.
<P>   The judge has not only freed another man from death row but in his arbitrary decision he openly thwarts the citizens of Tennessee who want justice carried out.
<P>   In 1979, Cary Ann Medlin was lured into a car as she rode a bicycle near her home. Robert Glen Coe, who at one time admitted to luring Cary Ann into his car, was convicted and sentenced to death.
<P>   Fifteen years later, Nixon says the trial judge erred. This is after Coe&#39;s appeals were rejected by both the state Court of Criminal Appeals and the state Supreme Court. And even the U.S. Supreme Court refused to listen to a petition Coe filed in 1984.
<P>   Nixon claims the trial judge failed to give the jury enough guidance when he did not define the words &#39;&#39;heinous, atrocious and cruel.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Sound familiar?
<P>   Those were the same words used in an opinion by Chief Justice Adolpho A. Birch when the state Supreme Court by a 3-2 vote reversed the death sentence of a man who raped and stabbed to death a 77-year-old woman. The uproar over that ruling led voters in August to oust state Supreme Court Justice Penny White, who was the only justice up for a yes-no retention vote this year.
<P>   Was White a handy victim for the voters&#39; frustration with Nixon? It seemed as if Chief Justice Birch went out of his way in writing his controversial opinion in fear of being reversed at some point by Nixon.
<P>   Ironically, although reversing Coe&#39;s conviction, Nixon rejected Coe&#39;s alibi, noting that &#39;&#39;substantial evidence&#39;&#39; linked him to the killing, including his confession, knowledge of the crime scene and the girl&#39;s injuries and his attempt to flee in disguise.
<P>   Yet, the conviction is reversed. The death sentence is vacated. Fifteen years have passed since the crime was committed. Witnesses are gone. Memories are faded. It will be very difficult to retry the case at this point, but at least the state plans to appeal Nixon&#39;s ruling.
<P>   The victim&#39;s mother said she expected the ruling because of Nixon&#39;s overturning two convictions in the 1977 brutal murder of a Memphis woman.
<P>   And judges wonder why the public is becoming upset.
<P>   U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens&#39; position certainly does little to build the public&#39;s confidence in the courts. In an August speech, Stevens said, &#39;&#39;A campaign promise to &#39;be tough on crime&#39; or to &#39;enforce the death penalty&#39; is evidence of bias that should disqualify a candidate from sitting on criminal cases.&#39;&#39; If so, the reverse should apply in seeing that a federal judge who openly is against the death penalty also is disqualified from hearing criminal cases.
<P>   Things are out of whack when rapes and murders of 8-year-old girls and 77-year-old women no longer are considered &#39;&#39;heinous, atrocious and cruel.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Judges are out of step with public opinion when they ask for protection from the citizens having the right to select or retain judges. Nixon provides the best argument on why federal judges should not get lifetime appointments.
<P>   Americans are tired of &#39;&#39;heinous and cruel&#39;&#39; crimes and equally tired of &#39;&#39;atrocious&#39;&#39; rulings by judges in ivory towers.

        Knoxville's fiscally sound</font<basefont><!--SUBHEAD--></b></font><p><font size="2"><i>By
        Harry Moskos, Editor</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="6"><br>
        </font>News stories about the economic woes of the city
        of Miami lead one to ask how Knoxville is financially. </p>
        <p>Fortunately, Knoxville's financial picture is a lot
        brighter than Miami's. </p>
        <p>Years of deficit spending and budget mismanagement
        along with some corruption thrown in for good measure
        have left Miami about $68million in debt, forcing the
        state of Florida to set up an oversight board to monitor
        that city's finances. </p>
        <p>Miami's problems become public amid a federal probe of
        corruption. The city manager and finance manager both
        resigned and now face federal charges. </p>
        <p>As a result of its financial problems, Miami's debt
        rating slid to junk-bond status, which is typically a
        rating below ''B.'' In addition, the city began using
        money set aside for long-term projects to pay ongoing
        expenses. </p>
        <p>Debt ratings can vary from ''AAA'' downward with a
        limited number of cities holding the top rating.
        Generally, the larger the city the less likely it is to
        have a ''AAA'' rating. Only 15 states have such a rating,
        including Tennessee. </p>
        <p>If you have a healthy city financially, the likelihood
        is that you will have a healthy county as well. And
        that's the situation we have here. </p>
        <p>A lot of the credit must go to the state Legislature
        as well as the comptroller's office because the state
        establishes the guidelines on investment and borrowing
        for the local governments. </p>
        <p>Fitch Investor Service, one of the nation's leading
        rating companies, gives Knoxville a ''AA-'' rating,
        noting that this high rating ''reflects the city's
        moderate debt burden, strong financial position, and
        stable economic base. The steady strengthening in the
        financial position is attributable to a diverse revenue
        stream and ongoing expense controls.'' </p>
        <p>Moody's Investor Service gives the city its ''A1''
        rating, noting that Knoxville has ''average debt burden
        with rapid payout.'' Moody added that Knoxville's
        financial operations are supported by a healthy revenue
        mix, including property taxes and increasing sales tax
        revenue. </p>
        <p>Knoxville always didn't bask in such a glowing
        financial picture. Mayor Kyle Testerman, in his last
        term, started the process to improve the city's financial
        outlook, and this has been carried aggressively forward
        by Mayor Victor Ashe during the past nine years. </p>
        <p>Knoxville's debt at the start of the current fiscal
        year was almost $138.9million. It will be reduced by more
        than $11million to $127.7million by the start of the next
        fiscal year. Both Fitch and Moody refer favorably to the
        city's very rapid debt amortization. The city's budget
        totals $220million, and Knoxville currently has a
        $19million balance in its general fund, which reflects
        revenue over expenditures. </p>
        <p>Miami Mayor Joe Carollo said many of his city's
        problems can be resolved by cutting back on misspending
        and collecting overdue fees, including delinquent garbage
        fees that could be costing that city more than $1million
        a year. One can only wonder how a city could fail to
        collect garbage and other fees. </p>
        <p>We often take government for granted and, at times,
        are liberal with our criticism, but we should also give
        praise when our elected and appointed officials do a good
        job by keeping a keen eye on public funds. </p>

        <font size="5">T</font>he last week is always frantic,
        but everything falls into place and 3,504 Empty Stocking
        Fund food baskets are distributed to make the holiday
        season a little brighter for those families hit by hard
        times. </p>
        <p>Since 1912, The News-Sentinel's Empty Stocking Fund
        has been providing food baskets and toys, thanks to the
        generosity of hundreds of Knoxville area citizens who
        contribute money to buy the 41 different food items that
        go in the baskets and by the many volunteers who show up
        to pack the baskets and help with the distribution. </p>
        <p>About 500 of the baskets were distributed last Monday
        by crews from the Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad and
        several social services agencies who delivered the
        75-pound food baskets to shut-ins and others unable to
        show up at the mass distribution on Christmas Eve
        morning. </p>
        <p>The activity at the Tennessee Valley Fair's Jacob
        Building started on the Thursday before Christmas with
        the delivery of the equipment. The first groceries were
        delivered on Friday and volunteers started packing that
        afternoon with the activity continuing throughout
        Saturday. </p>
        <p>On Monday, the frozen turkeys and bakery products,
        including bread, rolls and cakes, were delivered. By 6
        a.m. Tuesday, the distribution was well under way, and by
        noon, the Jacob Building was all but empty. </p>
        <p>Coordinating the effort is Jacquelyn Brown, The
        News-Sentinel's public service director, and her
        assistant, Chrystal B. Talbott. They are kept busy for
        weeks before ordering the food, scheduling volunteers and
        coordinating the complex distribution program with the
        Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee, which
        screens the applicants seeking assistance. </p>
        <p>In addition to those getting the food baskets, the
        Empty Stocking Fund provides nearly $16,000 to the Mobile
        Meals program to deliver prepared meals to those in need
        during the Christmas-New Year holiday period. The Mobile
        Meals are provided to those who normally would qualify
        for Empty Stocking Fund food baskets but are unable to
        cook the food because of physical or health problems. </p>
        <p>The contents of the food baskets are designed to last
        beyond the Christmas meal itself. In addition to the
        turkey, fresh vegetables and fruits, the basket contains
        an assortment of canned and packaged food items that
        should provide meals beyond the holiday. </p>
        <p>The volunteers are a story in themselves. Many come
        year after year, such as Linda Webber of Seymour who has
        been volunteering for 30years. </p>
        <p>''Oh, Lord, I love it,'' she beamed to explain her
        buoyant enthusiasm. ''You are giving to them, but when
        you see their faces of appreciation they are giving back
        to you.'' </p>
        <p>Webber and her four children, who also help every
        year, have seen a lot of changes in the distribution
        process. ''It is more automated now.'' she chuckled.
        ''When we first did it, we weighed the potatoes on a
        scale.'' </p>
        <p>Ernie Roberts, the Key Club sponsor at Bearden High
        School, shows up every year with many of his students,
        such as Seth Kehne, a sophomore, who is back for his
        fourth year as a volunteer, explaining that, ''It's fun.
        You get to spend time with your friends and it makes you
        feel good, too.'' </p>
        <p>Seth is following in the footsteps of his sister,
        Stacy, who has been a volunteer for many years and helped
        out again this year while on break from Elon College in
        North Carolina. </p>
        <p>Another Key clubber, sophomore Rena Thio, who weighs
        in at 82 pounds, joked that the food baskets ''weigh
        about as much as I do.'' </p>
        <p>It all comes together. Every year. It has been that
        way since 1912. All because of the wonderful people who
        help the Empty Stocking Fund to help others. </p>
        <p>To all, thank you and a Happy New Year. </p>

        ponders Gingrich<!--SUBHEAD--></b></font><p><font size="2"><i>By
        Richard Powelson News-Sentinel Washington bureau</i></font></p>
        <p><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>ennessee's Republican U.S. House
        members, among House Speaker Newt Gingrich's strongest
        supporters in the past, now face a dilemma in whether to
        vote Tuesday to re-elect him after he admitted wrongdoing
        in a major ethics case. </p>
        <p>What is making it worse for the House Republican rank
        and file is that they won't know Gingrich's punishment,
        if any, for giving inaccurate statements to the ethics
        committee until some time after the House's leadership
        election Tuesday. </p>
        <p>If they vote for him this week, and he later receives
        a strong reprimand and more details of wrongdoing
        surface, will voters judge them as dangerously loyal to
        senior Republicans and hold that against them in their
        next election in 1998? </p>
        <p>At the very least, Tennessee Republicans may embarrass
        themselves over this quandary. It's a lose-lose situation
        for them. </p>
        <p>If they vote against Gingrich Tuesday, he likely would
        be re-elected anyway and could retaliate against them
        when they want help with legislation during the next two
        years. If they vote for him, they may find their action
        hard to defend to voters back home. </p>
        <p>After all, Gingrich is not the only Republican in the
        House capable of leading the troops. Dozens of
        intelligent, ethical Republican members could do a
        credible job as House speaker. </p>
        <p>From a political standpoint, Democrats secretly hope
        Gingrich is re-elected. That would make Republicans'
        ongoing criticism of alleged wrongdoing by Bill and
        Hillary Clinton on several matters sound extremely
        hypocritical. </p>
        <p>Reps. John J. Duncan Jr. of Knoxville and Zach Wamp of
        Chattanooga have said they need more information about
        Gingrich's ethics case before commenting on whether he
        should be re-elected speaker. </p>
        <p>Gingrich admitted Dec. 21 that statements he submitted
        to the House ethics panel about establishing a nonprofit
        organization were ''inaccurate, incomplete and
        unreliable.'' But he said he ''did not intend to mislead
        the committee.'' </p>
        <p>Two letters sent to the committee under his name said
        incorrectly that GOPAC, a political fund-raising
        committee that Gingrich once headed, had no connection to
        a college course that he taught. </p>
        <p>House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., already has
        called for Gingrich to give up the speakership after his
        lie to the ethics committee. </p>
        <p>Many Democrats still are angry at Gingrich for filing
        the complaint that led to the 1989 resignation of former
        House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. The House Ethics
        Committee had accused him of arranging bulk sales of his
        book to get around House limits on speaking fees. </p>
        <p>Gingrich's re-election would give Democrats a strong
        issue to argue again and again on the House floor this
        year, providing another year in which members talk too
        much and act too little. For example, everyone agrees
        that the Medicare health-care program for senior citizens
        needs major reforms to have adequate funding to keep up
        its responsibilities. </p>
        <p>Republicans are being asked by their leadership to
        keep the faith, vote for Gingrich Tuesday and to have
        confidence that other developments later won't embarrass
        them. It's a lot to ask of them. </p>
        <p>Perhaps the best political position for rank-and-file
        Republicans would be to name a temporary speaker for a
        month or two -- Gingrich if they wish. That would enable
        them to resolve Gingrich's punishment and then decide if
        he or someone else should be named as long-term speaker
        for the remainder of the two-year term. </p>
        <p>It will be impossible for House Republicans to get
        accurate feedback from voters about Gingrich's fate as
        speaker before all aspects of the allegations against
        Gingrich are resolved. </p>

        <font size="5">T</font>wo East Tennessee House members'
        new committee assignments will make them potentially more
        influential friends for the Tennessee Valley Authority
        and, sometimes, more powerful foes when viewpoints clash.
        </p>
        <p>Rep. Zach Wamp, representing the Oak
        Ridge-to-Chattanooga district, has been named to the
        Appropriations Committee and as chairman of the House TVA
        Caucus. In both positions, he said, he can better defend
        TVA's interests as Congress talks more of deregulating
        electricity rates and service areas nationally. The
        Appropriations Committee generally sets the federal
        funding level for TVA that is accepted by the full House.
        </p>
        <p>Rep. Van Hilleary, whose district includes a slice of
        Knox County, a big chunk of East and Middle Tennessee and
        a couple of West Tennessee counties, has been added to
        the Budget Committee, which sets budget outlines for all
        federal functions in the early part of each year. The
        panel has been trying the last two years to end TVA's
        annual federal funding of about $100million for programs
        including environmental research, economic development,
        forest and public lands management. </p>
        <p>The Appropriations Committee is not bound to accept
        every budget cut proposal made by the Budget Committee --
        and doesn't. </p>
        <p>Hilleary's work on the panel should be very
        interesting. He is not easily tagged as TVA friend or
        foe. He has much interest in TVA activities, especially
        at the TVA-managed lakes in his district. But he has been
        open in his criticism of TVA management when he disagrees
        with policies or proposals. Last year he led a
        one-person, successful mission to bar TVA for a year from
        going ahead with a proposal to charge a $1,000 deposit to
        each future owner of lake structures, such as boat docks,
        on TVA lakes. </p>
        <p>Hilleary and his staff did not appreciate the run
        around and stone walling that TVA managers coordinated
        before Hilleary's dock-deposit amendment was passed. So,
        TVA managers now will have to take Hilleary's opinions
        more seriously. </p>
        <p>Wamp generally is supportive of TVA programs. But he
        was disappointed recently when TVA decided to move 100
        TVA employees from Chattanooga in his district to TVA
        Chairman Craven Crowell's hometown of Nashville. Crowell
        has been serving as chairman of the Nashville Chamber of
        Commerce's jobs creation committee, but TVA has insisted
        there is no connection between Crowell's volunteer work
        and the jobs transfers. </p>
        <p>Last April, Wamp criticized TVA management for
        deciding to spend up to $8million in a year on corporate
        advertising. He also has questioned the wisdom of TVA
        management considering laying off its 200 security
        officers and replacing them with cheaper contract
        employees and for considering buying or leasing a
        $5.2million luxury corporate jet to whisk bureaucrats to
        meetings and site inspections in high style. </p>
        <p>Wamp and Hilleary also have TVA nuclear power plants
        operating in each of their districts, giving them another
        reason to want TVA management to do well. </p>
        <p>Wamp has 6,000 TVA employees in his district, the most
        in any district in the portions of seven states that TVA
        serves. He has said he wants to make sure that TVA is not
        shortchanged if electricity sales are opened up the same
        way that long-distance telephone service has been. </p>
        <p>One major concern of TVA officials is whether all
        private power companies will become free to sell power
        anywhere, while TVA, a public power entity, could be left
        confined to its seven-state service boundary. </p>
        <p>TVA also is hoping for no severe cuts in its nonpower
        programs as Congress continues scaling down agency
        budgets to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002. It
        will be an interesting year to see when Wamp and Hilleary
        will choose to fight for or against TVA management. </p>

        finance reform<!--SUBHEAD--></b></font><p><font size="2"><i>By Richard
        Powelson News-Sentinel Washington bureau</i></font></p>
        <p><br>
        <font size="5">R</font>ep. Zach Wamp has a great idea on
        how to make progress toward reforming the severely flawed
        campaign financing system. </p>
        <p>In partisan Washington, however, that can mean Wamp's
        plan will be shipped by congressional leaders to
        Warehouse No. 86926, never to be seen again. </p>
        <p>Party leaders often don't grab great ideas unless they
        can make their respective party look good for suggesting
        something and the other party look bad for opposing it. </p>
        <p>When is the last time that you saw House Speaker Newt
        Gingrich and Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt at a
        press conference saying they both backed a major new
        initiative and that neither party was going to claim
        credit for thinking of it? It doesn't happen. </p>
        <p>Wamp, a Chattanooga Republican, is one of only about a
        dozen House members who refuse political donations from
        interest groups, also known as political action
        committees or PACs. Another is Van Hilleary, a Spring
        City Republican. </p>
        <p>So, it makes sense that Wamp would favor campaign
        finance reform. </p>
        <p>Wamp's idea is simple. He wants the House leaders from
        both parties to name a bipartisan panel with an equal
        number of House members from each party and give them
        three months to produce a campaign finance reform package
        with attractive elements for both parties. </p>
        <p>He figures that an outside commission would not be
        plugged in well enough to draft something that Congress
        could pass. </p>
        <p>Well, Wamp suggested his idea Nov. 25 in letters to
        House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, and to
        Democratic leader Richard Gephardt. Neither leader has
        responded to date. </p>
        <p>Party leaders now have other matters on their minds.
        Democrats are trying to make Gingrich look as bad as
        possible over his ethics case and his Dec. 21 admission
        of providing false information to the House Ethics
        Committee and to seek as severe a punishment as they can
        get. Democrats also are hoping the whole ordeal takes
        more of the shine off all Republican candidates in
        voters' minds. </p>
        <p>Republicans are gearing up for another year of Clinton
        bashing. They are planning hearings and endless
        discussions over whether the Democratic National
        Committee and the Clinton-Gore campaign broke laws in
        receiving donations from foreign individuals and
        companies last year. Also, both parties will be accusing
        the other of terrible proposals for the 1998 budget
        cycle. </p>
        <p>A big difficulty in campaign finance reform is that
        many Republicans don't want to ban campaign donations
        from business interests which give generously to them.
        Many Democrats don't want to cut off the labor groups'
        donations that go primarily to their candidates. </p>
        <p>Many Democrats like the idea of public financing of
        congressional races in a fashion similar to the matching
        funds given presidential primary candidates. Most
        Republicans oppose public funds in congressional races. </p>
        <p>Wamp is hoping that the pressure of a deadline would
        prompt a task force to come up with a workable plan. He
        favors ending interest groups' donations to campaigns but
        realizes that ban could be found unconstitutional by the
        courts. So, he is proposing a way to neutralize part of
        the influence of PACs. </p>
        <p>He proposes to lower what a PAC may donate per
        candidate from the current $5,000 per election to $2,000.
        Then he would raise what individuals may give from the
        current $1,000 to $2,000 per candidate per election. </p>
        <p>Also, Wamp would force candidates to go home for more
        fund raising, requiring that a majority of total funds
        come from individuals living in the candidate's home
        state. </p>
        <p>As one of the newest House members, Wamp still is
        hopeful that House leaders eventually will do the right
        thing and clean up campaign fund raising. He promises to
        follow up on his idea with Gingrich after some
        distractions disappear. </p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>August 4, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>HILLEARY IS SHOWING BULLDOG 
TOUGHNESS </h2>
<p><em>By Richard Powelson, News-Sentinel Washington bureau</em></p>
<p>Mayor Victor Ashe played up his childhood nickname ``Bulldog'' during his 
unsuccessful 1984 U.S. Senate race. The candidate most likely to earn that 
nickname this campaign is Rep. Van Hilleary.</p>
<p>Hilleary latched onto a TVA idea a couple of weeks ago that he found 
troubling, kept after it, and in less than two weeks got the full House to vote 
to block TVA from putting the concept into effect.</p>
<p>The issue was whether TVA should impose a $1,000 deposit on each of the 
roughly 60,000 owners of docks and other structures on the 31 
TVA-managed lakes in parts of seven states. TVA staff was getting public 
input on the idea when many lake dwellers started complaining about the 
cost to Hilleary, who is from Spring City, located near Watts Bar Lake.</p>
<p>It struck him as an excessive and unnecessary deposit because he believed 
that most lake dwellers took good care of their docks, boat houses and 
other structures.</p>
<p>Most members of Congress who get upset with a TVA idea will complain 
and then hope the agency backs off. Hilleary didn't want to wait and see if 
the TVA board would assess the deposit on thousands of lake property 
owners.</p>
<p>His strategy for passing his bill was interesting. Although he has been in 
Congress for less than two years, he knew that the number of opponents to 
most bills declines as the night wears on. He also lined up support for his 
amendment with the proper committee chairman.</p>
<p>So, he waited as late as he could -- sometime after midnight -- to offer his 
TVA proposal as an amendment to the massive $19 billion energy and water 
development bill. By that time everyone was hoping to get to bed as soon as 
possible, and members who stayed around to vote were not in any mood for 
long debates. His amendment was approved quickly by a voice vote -- not 
the long recorded vote process.</p>
<p>The main energy and water bill includes annual funding for TVA's nonpower 
programs and for all U.S. energy and water programs.</p>
<p>The Senate version of the bill does not include the TVA prohibition, so the 
two bills next go to a conference committee to seek a compromise.</p>
<p>If Hilleary decides to adopt the bulldog theme for his campaign, he may not 
want to carry it as far as Ashe did in 1984. Remember that Ashe lost that 
race to Democrat Al Gore.</p>
<p>Ashe proved that year that one indeed can go too far with a good idea. 
Beyond his Bulldog nickname, Ashe had a campaign mascot named Bulldog, 
who also was a bulldog. The campaign route that Ashe took around the 
state was named the Bulldog Trail. Their transportation was in a specially 
painted ``bulldog mobile van.''</p>
<p>An Ashe brochure in 1984 showed no photo of the candidate on its cover 
but a picture of a bulldog on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. ``Bulldog Tough 
-- Downright Tennessee'' was one campaign theme. The campaign also had 
a drawing of a bulldog on a news release.</p>
<p>Hilleary, as a former combat pilot in the Air Force Reserve in Operation 
Desert Storm, is used to dealing with targets and achieving missions. So, it's 
understandable why he tried to quickly shoot down the TVA idea for dock 
deposits.</p>
<p>For now, though, TVA Chairman Craven Crowell is not dropping the dock 
deposit idea. He wrote to Hilleary that TVA should finish its public comment 
period through September before deciding which shoreline management 
ideas to adopt and which to reject.</p>
<p>Another TVA idea that Hilleary opposes is charging rent to landowners on 
TVA lakes if they want to mow adjoining public land to improve their view 
of the lake. He expects public pressure eventually will prompt TVA officials 
to back away from major changes with big impacts on lake property 
owners.</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>August 11, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>SENATOR DREAMS OF PERFECT 
CONGRESS </h2>
<p><em>By Richard Powelson, News-Sentinel Washington bureau</em></p>
<p>Sen. Fred Thompson has been dreaming of the perfect Congress.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine how the Tennessee Republican can fulfill this dream in his 
lifetime. But perhaps some of his friends in Hollywood, where he previously 
appeared in about 20 films, could produce a Disney fantasy, something 
along the lines of ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' and help prod the real 
Congress in the right direction.</p>
<p>One of his ideas is that Congress complete work on a two-year budget 
package by Sept. 30 of every odd-numbered year. (OK, stop laughing. 
He's serious.)</p>
<p>Congress traditionally cannot agree on an annual budget until several weeks 
or months after its Sept. 30 deadline for the new fiscal year starting Oct. 1. 
So, they pass many temporary extensions.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, Thompson proposes that members of Congress pass 
a rule that they would not get any more paychecks after Sept. 30 until their 
budget work is completed. (OK, you may laugh again.)</p>
<p>He is talking about a Congress that long ago set up an ingenious system 
allowing its members automatic annual pay raises -- unless they voted to 
eliminate them. Every worker would like such a system.</p>
<p>He also is talking about a Congress that has shut down the federal 
government several times, sent federal workers home to play and then voted 
later to pay them for the entire time they were not working.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine how much turnover would be needed in Congress to get 
a body willing to cut off paychecks for missing deadlines.</p>
<p>Another Thompson idea is for Congress to pass a rule saying that its 
members would not be paid after July 31 in even-numbered years if they had 
not adjourned by then. This idea actually should have a good chance of 
passing after members realize the early dismissal would give them much 
more time to campaign full time for re-election. But voters likely would not 
welcome a longer period of full-blown candidate mud-slinging.</p>
<p>His stated belief is that the early adjournment would give members more 
time to mingle with the home folks and get to know their priorities better.</p>
<p>Thompson's proposal for a two-year budget cycle is an old idea that 
continues to make much sense. Congress now spends most of its year every 
year reviewing, debating, arguing, amending and finally passing budgets for 
federal offices.</p>
<p>That doesn't leave enough time for Congress to hold oversight hearings into 
the causes of continuing problems in different areas of government and 
society and what solutions should be devised.</p>
<p>On welfare reform, for example, many states, including Tennessee, got tired 
of waiting on Congress to pass welfare reform and adopted their own 
changes in recent years. Finally, Congress did pass welfare reform recently, 
but it appeared more as part of a domino effect than as an example of 
leadership.</p>
<p>Former Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., worked on the two-year budget cycle 
idea in 1993. Others had talked of its merits earlier. When Sasser was 
defeated in November 1994, he hadn't accomplished much on the two-year 
budget cycle idea, despite being chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle to passage of this good idea is that many members like 
to be able to add their favorite home-area projects to budget bills every 
year. They figure these frequent reminders to voters of their influence and 
power on budgetary matters will pay off at election time.</p>
<p>All too often voters are favorably impressed by the political miracle of 
members being able to increase funding for local projects while pointing to 
ever-smaller government loans to pay all the bills.</p>

SMOKE? </h2>
<p><em>By Richard Powelson, News-Sentinel Washington bureau</em></p>
<p>A Florida smoker's recent legal victory against a cigarette company has 
provided a much more favorable political climate for President Clinton's plan 
to better deter children from smoking.</p>
<p>Tobacco company documents presented in the liability lawsuit in Florida 
showed how Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco executives knew they were 
selling an addictive and unhealthy product. That evidence will make it difficult 
for Tennessee members of Congress and others supportive of the tobacco 
industry to keep arguing that the federal government should not have a role 
in helping youths to avoid the smoking habit.</p>
<p>``We are, then, in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug,'' said 
part of a 1963 memo written by Addison Yeaman, then the president of 
Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco.</p>
<p>The jury studied the memo and much other damning evidence and ordered 
Brown &amp; Williamson to pay $750,000 to Grady Carter, 66, who had to 
have part of a lung cut out after cancer-causing chemicals of cigarette smoke 
contaminated his lungs after decades of exposure.</p>
<p>Brown &amp; Williamson, of course, will appeal the verdict and keep trying to 
protect the industry from a flood of lawsuits from dying smokers.</p>
<p>The pleasant-sounding B&amp;W brand that Carter began smoking and kept 
smoking for many years was misnamed Lucky Strikes. He didn't feel lucky, 
he testified at the trial, when he was unable to quit smoking until a smoking 
disease greatly deteriorated his health, made him cough up blood and forced 
surgeons to chop out the blackened, cancerous part of his once-pink lung.</p>
<p>The tobacco industry continues to be shameless in how it markets a product 
that its executives know is unhealthy and addictive. Brown &amp; Williamson's 
attorney argued at the Florida trial that Carter knew he was risking his health 
by smoking and chose to accept that risk by continuing to smoke. In other 
words: Carter should blame only himself and not the industry's advertising 
which makes smoking look fun, safe and sexy.</p>
<p>Many smokers have lost previous liability lawsuits because the industry hid 
behind the surgeon general's health warning that Congress ordered on an 
U.S. cigarettes beginning in 1966. The warning clearly says that smoking is 
dangerous to health, so smokers ignoring the warning are not entitled to 
damages, the industry has argued successfully in the past.</p>
<p>Tennessee's members of Congress usually try to play both sides of the fence 
on the smoking issue.</p>
<p>To appeal to health-minded people, they admit that smoking is unhealthy and 
that children should not take up the habit. To audiences of tobacco farmers 
and those who oppose most federal rules, they say the federal government 
should not adopt more rules dealing with smoking.</p>
<p>Tobacco companies could voluntarily reduce marketing of cigarettes to 
children, they say, or states could step in with new rules if needed. But many 
states in the past have chosen to do little to keep cigarettes away from 
children; they are focusing on violent crime and more immediate problems.</p>
<p>The tobacco companies are so scared that Clinton's plans will effectively 
reduce cigarette sales to children and reduce their profits that they have filed 
a lawsuit to block any new federal rules. Clinton wants to ban vending 
machine sales of cigarettes, bar cigarette brand names on shirts and caps, 
keep cigarette billboards away from schools and sporting events, and 
toughen penalties for over-the-counter sales to children.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it appears, judges will decide whether it remains easy for many 
children to buy cigarettes, get addicted and die before having much quality 
time with their grandchildren.</p>

<p>Tennessee has so much natural beauty, the magnificent mountains of East 
Tennessee and dozens of peaceful lakes reflecting towering firs and dreamy 
blue skies, that it has been easy to take it all for granted.</p>
<p>Tight budgets have prompted federal and Tennessee Valley Authority 
officials to float various fund-raising ideas to preserve these treasures, but 
critics have tried to shelve each one quickly.</p>
<p>These ideas and more deserve a closer look. Those enjoying the region's 
natural resources are -- or should be -- willing to do their fair share to 
support them.</p>
<p>Imagine the serenity that one feels living on a Tennessee lakeshore, watching 
the sun many mornings as it sparkles millions of rays of light across the 
water, pushing graceful birds into flight to search for breakfast. One can take 
a relaxing boat excursion out where the ducks are roosting, swaying with the 
wake, and plop a fishing line into the water and wait, without a care, without 
a watch, for dinner to nudge you with a slight tug on your hook.</p>
<p>Out on the roads and trails in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, 
there is not a much bigger thrill than to encounter a deer, wild turkey, a 
salamander, brightly colored birds or to climb at your own pace up one of 
the peaks and feel the rush from a vast vision of nature's grandeur.</p>
<p>How much are these wonderful experiences worth? Many more times what 
anyone is asking park and lake users to pay.</p>
<p>The penalty for not properly dealing with the upkeep of and threats against 
the state's lakes and mountains is becoming increasingly obvious. Roads, 
bridges, water and sewer systems are deteriorating from lack of funding for 
TVA's Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area. Industrial 
emissions continue to mar the visual beauty of the Smokies on many days 
because the air pollution problem has not been dealt with adequately by 
state, federal and regional planners.</p>
<p>Some trails have been closed in the Smokies, roads need more money for 
resurfacing, and the park needs more funds to hire enough employees for 
adequate maintenance and tourist services. Some vocal critics complain, 
however, every time anyone suggests seeking state government approval for 
a reasonable entrance fee to the park. There is none now, only campground 
fees.</p>
<p>So, many of the 9 million annual visitors to the most-visited national park pay 
absolutely nothing to help with the costs of road wear from their vehicles, to 
collect the trash they put in park cans or litter about, for the water and 
sewage treatment costs associated with their restroom stops.</p>
<p>Many residents on TVA-managed lakes have objected to an idea to charge 
a $1,000 refundable deposit for every family with a structure on a public 
lake: a dock, boat house or shore wall. The idea is aimed at making it 
financially possible for TVA to remove damaged or dilapidated structures 
that owners refuse to repair.</p>
<p>TVA must recover its costs of removing the dangerous structures on public 
lakes and have adequate revenues to regularly survey shores for problem 
areas. It appears that some sort of structure deposit is needed, perhaps a 
smaller amount, that would be refundable to responsible landowners when 
they sell their property, or TVA should get legal authority to fine property 
owners ignoring their dangerous structures.</p>
<p>Many public parks still are free of charge or have very low fees. But federal 
and state budget reductions are forcing cuts in the general subsidies for these 
areas, mandating that users of these heavenly settings will have to pay more 
in the near future for their pleasurable experiences. This newspaper has 
supported park fees, with the express condition that the funding stay at the 
parks. The parks must be adequately maintained for future visitors.</p>

<HEAD><TITLE>SURVIVAL IS KEY TO FALL CAMPAIGNING</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><A HREF="/"><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="A Publication of News-Sentinel Online" BORDER=0></A><center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>September  8, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>SURVIVAL IS KEY TO FALL CAMPAIGNING</H2>

With less than two months before the presidential election, Tennessee politicians of both parties are deep into their political games mode.<P>

    During the intensive games period after Labor Day, there are very few rules. Facts can be -- and often are -- bent, ignored or totally changed by the players.<P>

    It's not fun for everyone, but the partisans seem to enjoy the verbal wrestling.<P>

    Here are some of the players and their moves to date:<P>

    * Vice President Al Gore of Tennessee has claimed that presidential candidate Bob Dole's budget plan would shut down the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which employs 5,000 in the Oak Ridge-Knoxville area. Dole has proposed $32billion in cuts for the Department of Energy, but how they would affect Oak Ridge precisely remains to be determined.<P>

    * Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., addressed the Republican National Convention last month, saying: ``Bill Clinton favors ... turn(ing) health care over -- lock, stock and barrel -- to Washington bureaucrats who think they know best.'' Clinton favored a broad health-reform plan in 1994 but did not advocate having Washington take over all health-care plans.<P>

    * Rep. John J. Duncan Jr. of Knoxville, a Republican, has an underfunded Democratic opponent this year, but you won't hear much about him. Duncan has adopted the long-successful strategy of veteran Rep. Jimmy Quillen, which is to never make public mention of an opponent's name.<P>

    * Labor unions have been trying to defeat Republican Rep. Van Hilleary of Spring City, criticizing him for various positions. One erroneous claim was that Hilleary voted for a pay raise for himself and others in Congress. No such vote came up during his tenure.<P>

    * President Clinton was getting criticized by various Republicans for his foreign policy, including dealing with Iraq. But Clinton's order last week for missile strikes at key military targets in Iraq silenced many critics, including Tennessee Republicans.<P>

    Sens. Frist and Fred Thompson felt compelled to take public stands in favor of the military action that Clinton ordered, although they focused their comments on the U.S. military's work and were silent on Clinton's role.<P>

    Frist said, ``I fully support'' the missile assault on Iraqi military targets. ``It is critical that the U.S. act decisively.''<P>

    Thompson called it ``a completely justified response'' to Iraqi troop movements against the Kurds.<P>

    Rep. Zach Wamp, a Chattanooga Republican, was more vague on his position. He said the U.S. assault on Iraqi military targets was a reminder ``of the constant need for a strong national defense and the resolve to use force when necessary.''<P>

    * Frist and others have been trying to win approval of reforms in the Medicare program to get incredible cost increases under control. Frist, a former surgeon, has been the leader of a Senate task force on the issue. Without huge savings in the near future, the program clearly will begin running deficits.<P>

    President Clinton's own commission has noted the looming deficits. Clinton, while backing some cost-cutting reforms for Medicare, has strongly criticized the more ambitious Republican reforms, claiming they would greatly harm senior citizens.<P>

   The public debate has hurt Republicans, even though Clinton has exaggerated the potential impact on the elderly. The result has been no reforms in a year when strong action was needed.<P>

    Partisan posturing in both parties has delayed action on many important bills this year. Whichever candidates survive the bloodbath of the fall campaigns will have to work quickly early next year to lessen more of the country's budgetary problems.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>ELECTION PROMISES MAY NOT MATERIALIZE</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><a href="/"><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="A Knoxville News-Sentinel Online product" border=0></a></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>September 15, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>ELECTION PROMISES MAY NOT MATERIALIZE</H2>

Tennessee Sen. Bill Frist was talking recently about how Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole could pull ahead of front-runner Bill Clinton and emphasized that Dole just needs to put more emphasis on his proposal for a 15 percent income tax cut.<P>

    Most voters have not forgotten that Bill Clinton in 1992 promised a middle-class tax cut. It hasn't happened yet, but Clinton did ask Congress to pass specific tax cuts, such as a $500-per-child tax credit.<P>

    Voters of either party could wonder, however, why either candidate has advocated income tax cuts while the country still is drowning in $5.2 trillion total debt, growing by more than $100 billion annually. The financing costs for that debt are more than $235 billion a year.<P>

    How can politicians think it logical and reasonable to offer Americans big, expensive prizes (tax cuts) when they are holding I.O.U.s for $5.2 trillion? Answer: It's an election year.<P>

    Politicians in both major parties make so many proposals and promises to get elected that voters frankly don't believe that much of it can or will become reality. What it comes down to is which candidate voters like more.<P>

    In 1980 and 1992, voters didn't like the troubled economy under Presidents Carter and Bush, respectively, and turned them out of office. If the economy were real bad this year, Clinton no doubt would be forced out of office, too.<P>

    The economy has been showing steady (though slow) growth, inflation is low and under control, and the U.S. military remains strong under Clinton, as evidenced by action in Bosnia and Iraq.<P>

    So, while a majority of voters did not support Clinton in a three-way race in 1992, he remains well ahead in the national polls with less than two months before the presidential election.<P>

    Many voters have heard about Dole's income tax cut plan and likely believe he can do it about as well as Clinton has fulfilled his 1992 campaign promise to balance the federal budget.<P>

    With a divided government, presidents often are unable to see their promises become reality because Congress has other priorities.<P>

    Sometimes, too, candidates change their priorities after they are elected. President Reagan, for example, first promised to balance the budget but then pushed successfully in his first term for a large income tax cut that greatly increased the annual budget deficit. Republicans say the tax cut helped the weak economy; Democrats note the huge deficits under Reagan and cast doubt about whether it helped the economy much.<P>

    The federal budget deficits rose more than $500 billion under the first four years of Reagan's administration. The previous president, Jimmy Carter, generally was criticized for allowing the economy to become miserable with high inflation and high interest rates. But the budget deficits were a paltry $181billion by comparison during Carter's four years in office.<P>

    This year the budget deficit is expected to hit $117billion, the lowest level in many years. Clinton shouldn't take credit for that. The Republican-controlled Congress pressured him to accept many budget cuts that led to the lower deficit.<P>

    The deficit would have been even lower this year if Republicans had their way. But Clinton won the public relations battle by arguing that deeper cuts would hurt senior citizens, children and other groups. Republicans had to back away from the deeper cuts.<P>

    Now Dole's tax cut talk is raising the same kinds of questions about whether popular social programs would have to be axed to allow the tax cuts. Since Dole is not detailing all the budget cuts that would be needed to pay for a tax cut, he has left himself open to Clinton claims that senior citizens, children and so on would have to be hurt to make good on Dole's plan.<P>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>U</font>.S. Rep. Jimmy Quillen's year-end retirement after 34 years in office 
marks the end of a political era for the state in a couple of ways. </p>
<p>The state used to have several members in Congress at any given time who 
were long-termers. Quillen is the last of them to leave. The state's newer 
members of Congress talk often about term limits for members of Congress, 
suggesting they don't plan to become careerists in Washington. </p>
<p>Quillen, 80, also was part of a class of Republicans who struggled with ways 
to lower the annual budget deficits while still seeking periodic funneling of 
federal funds to special projects in their districts. Newer members are finding 
it tougher and tougher to get special funds for their areas while leaders plan 
ways to balance the budget over seven years. </p>
<p>It's not difficult to determine why Quillen is retiring after 34 years while his 
health still appears good. </p>
<p>He has said it is because he feels pulled to stay in Kingsport with his ailing 
wife, who has had serious, long-term illnesses for 15years. But another 
major reason has to be that serving in the House now is not as satisfying for 
many members as it used to be. </p>
<p>Partisan and ideological arguments in the House and Senate have intensified 
in recent years, greatly slowing down action on nearly every controversial bill 
on the floor. </p>
<p>Congressional sessions often run late into the evening and at times even past 
midnight. Such a schedule makes it impossible to get enough sleep, leaving 
members tired, irritable and wondering if all the nationally televised bickering 
really is a public service or mostly a public spectacle. Quillen and others 
were known to catch regular afternoon naps to store up energy for these 
late-night sessions. </p>
<p>During the last two years members have had to use up much physical energy 
and political chits just to spare their favorite projects from being deeply cut 
or even eliminated. </p>
<p>Among Tennessee's big programs facing threats of deep budget cuts at times 
were the Oak Ridge operations, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the 
Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Oak Ridge and TVA did end up 
with cuts, but ones less drastic than first were proposed. </p>
<p>Quillen was among the leaders helping TVA's budget to avoid catastrophe. 
His departure leaves the state with five Republican members in the House 
and Senate with two years of experience and one Republican with eight 
years in office. Only one Democrat from the state facing re-election has 
double-digit years of experience, and he (Bart Gordon of Murfreesboro) has 
a strong challenger. </p>
<p>Over the years Quillen has secured many millions of dollars for big projects 
in his district: leading the effort to build a medical school at East Tennessee 
State University, expanding and modernizing the Veteran's Administration 
medical center at Johnson City, stopping a flooding problem in Sevierville, 
building new highways and water lines. </p>
<p>As senior Republican on the Rules Committee, he often got the limelight on 
the floor and on the House's nationally televised cable channel, C-Span, to 
argue for or against rules governing amendments to legislation. </p>
<p>Quillen was considered unbeatable in his heavily Republican 1stDistrict 
throughout his 34 years, mostly because he and his staff paid much attention 
to concerns raised by individuals and civic and local government officials. </p>
<p>Though often appearing very serious in his floor speeches, Quillen also has a 
humorous side. He once sneaked a live minnow into a clear glass pitcher of 
drinking water before a Rules Committee hearing on the endangered snail 
darter fish. </p>
<p>His retirement will make Knoxville's Rep. John J. Duncan Jr., first elected in 
1988, the state's senior Republican in Congress. </p>

<p><!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Dateline Here--><br>
<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>F</font>reshman Rep. Zach Wamp is the obvious choice to become the next 
chief defender in Congress of the Tennessee Valley Authority, one of the 
state's largest employers. </p>
<p>TVA's interests have long been represented in Congress by the state's senior 
member, Republican Rep. Jimmy Quillen, who has 34 years experience in 
Washington. Quillen's retirement is leaving an opening as chairman of the 
TVA Caucus, a group of members of Congress interested in TVA issues, 
including keeping power rates as low as possible. </p>
<p>Wamp's colleagues from TVA's seven-state service area last week elected 
him the TVA Caucus chairman, even though he has been in Congress only 
two years. They had several reasons for choosing him. </p>
<p>Republican Wamp has more TVA employees in his district, about 6,000, 
than any other member of Congress. TVA's massive power office is 
headquartered in Chattanooga, Wamp's political base, and TVA also runs 
the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant near Chattanooga. So, Wamp has an interest in 
helping TVA to continue to succeed. </p>
<p>Also, some note that the fast-talking Wamp appears to have the energy 
equivalence of about three members of Congress and has the personality of 
a natural-born salesman with substantial power of persuasion. </p>
<p>Quillen helped keep TVA out of trouble in various bills by getting the help of 
his many long-time friends in Congress. </p>
<p>Wamp won't have that benefit and will have to continue to build on his 
network of helpful contacts in the Congress. </p>
<p>In the past several years, TVA officials have feared legislative efforts to 
privatize it or to deeply slash its budget. They escaped both threats with 
much success. </p>
<p>Now TVA's biggest fear is an electric power deregulation bill that could be 
approved in the House early next year. The bill's current language would 
allow customers to start buying their power from any source in the country 
-- from whichever company was cheapest and reliable. </p>
<p>TVA long has argued that it is ready to compete in a deregulated 
environment, but has a major problem with the bill by Rep. Dan Schaefer, 
R-Colo., the chairman of the House energy and power subcommittee. It 
doesn't alter current law limiting TVA's service area to parts of seven states. </p>
<p>Fairness would dictate that TVA's fence be removed if all other power 
generators are allowed to sell throughout the country. But bills in Congress 
are not always fair. </p>
<p>Wamp has invited TVA to suggest amendments to Schaefer's bill that would 
make it more attractive to public power concerns like TVA. Then Wamp 
will have to line up enough political support to get TVA's views reflected in 
the bill. </p>
<p>Investor-owned utilities, such as Duke Power and American Electric Power, 
are not worried about their power prices being competitive with TVA's 
rates, which have been level for about 10 years. But they are concerned 
about playing on a level playing field. </p>
<p>For example, investor-owned utilities have to pay federal taxes on their 
revenues. TVA does not, but does make tax-equivalent payments to various 
communities of more than $200million a year. </p>
<p>Several of TVA's long-time, key supporters are retiring this year. Besides 
Quillen, others leaving are Rep. John Myers, R-Ind., chairman of the energy 
and water appropriations subcommittee; Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., the 
panel's senior Democratic member and former chairman; and Sen. Howell 
Heflin, D-Ala. </p>
<p>All the turnover in Congress will require TVA officials to work harder at 
explaining the need for its remaining nonpower programs annually financed 
by federal taxpayers. </p>

fortune than Tennessee Sen. Fred Dalton Thompson. </p>
<p>Consider these examples in recent to ancient chronological order: </p>
<p>His first re-election bid this year attracted no well-known opponent, so he 
has a big lead in the polls with only a month before the general election. </p>
<p>By winning re-election, he is almost guaranteed because of Senate turnover 
to be named chairman of a major committee, Governmental Affairs, in only 
his third year in the Senate. </p>
<p>He got to date gorgeous country music star Lorrie Morgan for a while. They 
met because he was a U.S. Senate candidate networking with music industry 
people, and their paths crossed. </p>
<p>Only five weeks after winning his U.S. Senate race in November 1994, 
then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole selected Thompson to give the 
nationally televised Republican response to President Clinton's prime-time 
speech to announce plans for tax cuts and shrinking government. </p>
<p>Dole picked Thompson because his folksy, no-nonsense speaking style and 
lack of political background contrasted nicely with career-politician Clinton. </p>
<p>His 1994 victory for public office came in his first campaign. His good 
friends and fellow Republicans Howard Baker Jr. and Lamar Alexander had 
to campaign two different election cycles before winning a statewide office. </p>
<p>He got famous and wealthy from appearing in more than 20 big screen and 
television movies. His won his first movie role because he made a good 
impression on a movie producer doing research on a movie about one of 
Thompson's lawsuits involving the wrongfully fired chairman of the 
Tennessee Parole Board by Gov. Ray Blanton. Thompson was chosen to 
portray himself in the movie, ''Marie.'' </p>
<p>He got the case that shook up the Blanton administration because the fired 
parole board chairman just happened to walk into his law office instead of 
another law office in the building. </p>
<p>He attracted many clients to his Nashville and Washington law and lobbying 
offices partly because of his fame as minority counsel on the Senate 
Watergate Committee in the early 1970s and because of his handling of the 
parole board chairman's lawsuit. </p>
<p>Sen. Baker, the senior Republican on the Watergate Committee, picked 
Thompson as minority counsel in 1973 because he knew and trusted 
Thompson from Thompson's volunteer work on Baker's re-election 
campaign staff the previous year. If Thompson hadn't done the volunteer 
work for the Baker campaign in 1972, he probably would not be famous or 
a senator now. </p>
<p>His life prior to 1972 was a lot like many other average, hard-working 
Tennesseans of that time. Luck didn't have anything to do with it. </p>
<p>He got a good job in 1969 as assistant U.S. attorney in Nashville because 
he had done well in the prestigious law school at Vanderbilt University. He 
was accepted at Vanderbilt because his grades at then-Memphis State 
University were excellent. </p>
<p>Getting the money to attend MSU was not easy, he has told friends. He and 
his then-wife Sarah had to work different jobs to pay their expenses. (They 
were divorced in 1985.) Thompson at different times worked as a night 
clerk, in a bicycle factory, a shoe store, and driving trucks. </p>
<p>Even getting to college in Memphis from Lawrenceburg was tough, 
considering he married his high school sweetheart at age 17 and they began 
raising the first of three children while still very young parents. </p>
<p>His parents in Lawrenceburg did not go to college; his father sold used cars. 
So, his parents could not be of much financial help to him. </p>
<p>If Thompson gets much luckier, Hollywood will be making a movie of his 
life. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">R</font>ep. John J. Duncan Jr. has been
        receiving much attention in recent months for getting
        Congress and President Clinton to pass his bill to improve
        airline security and federal oversight of airlines. </p>
        <p>A quirk of history put Duncan's Republican Party in
        control of the House last year for the first time in 40
        years, and the seniority system put him in charge of the
        House aviation subcommittee. But Duncan seized his opportunity
        in a leadership position to work with staff for two years
        to produce a package winning broad praise, including
        compliments from Democratic President Clinton. </p>
        <p>Clinton last week singled out Duncan at the bill's
        signing, thanking Duncan for ''your leadership, for the
        fine work you did.'' Clinton didn't praise any other
        member of Congress for work on the bill. </p>
        <p>The only vocal criticism of the bill came from
        organized labor and its boosters in Congress, who opposed
        the provision making it impossible for Federal Express
        workers to organize locally. The bill allows them to organize
        only nationally. </p>
        <p>The parts of the bill that Clinton seemed to like
        most, judging from his public comments, were those
        recommended by an airline security task force headed by
        Vice President Al Gore after the crash of TWA Flight 800
        off Long Island, N.Y. </p>
        <p>Duncan's fingerprints were on several sections that
        stayed in the bill through House and Senate revisions. </p>
        <p>He was troubled by pilots with drug or safety problems
        getting fired at one airline and then getting hired at
        another because airlines did not routinely share
        employment records. Airlines were afraid of being sued by
        former pilots if they hurt their chances for work at
        other airlines. </p>
        <p>The bill requires airlines to share employment
        information and to check state records for moving
        violations regarding drugs or excessive speed or other violations
        that could raise a warning signal about a pilot changing
        jobs. </p>
        <p>Duncan also was concerned about children trying to set
        aviation records after a plane crashed in April, killing
        7-year-old Jessica Dubroff, her father and her flight
        instructor as they were trying to make her the youngest
        pilot to fly across the country. The bill threatens
        flight instructors with loss of their pilot's license if
        they help a child younger than 17 try to break a record. </p>
        <p>The Federal Aviation Administration in the past has
        complained about its bureaucratic delays in procurement
        and making personnel shifts because it had to work
        through the Department of Transportation hierarchy. The
        FAA is not an independent agency, but Congress earlier
        this year adopted language from another Duncan bill to
        allow the FAA to make its own personnel and purchasing
        decisions. The just-passed bill requires independent
        studies to determine if the FAA is becoming more
        efficient in these areas. </p>
        <p>The bill also slightly broadens the number of states
        -- from seven to nine -- which can make their own
        decisions on which local airports get a share of federal
        airport improvement funds. The federal government had
        been choosing all the worthy airports in the past. </p>
        <p>No one knows how long the GOP will be able to hold its
        House majority, allowing Duncan to remain the aviation
        subcommittee chairman. </p>
        <p>If the Republicans maintain control after next month's
        general election, Duncan plans next year to take on
        another big issue. The 10percent airline ticket tax needs
        renewal by Congress, and the biggest, oldest airlines
        want to change the way the tax is calculated so that
        consumers using discount airlines will pay more. Consumer
        groups will be watching Duncan closely to see how he
        handles it. </p>

<p><!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Dateline Here--><br>
<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>T</font>ennessee's Republican senators, Fred Thompson and Bill Frist, and 
Democratic President Clinton have been talking about their successes the 
last two years and in several cases are claiming credit for the same 
accomplishments. </p>
<p>In hindsight, it appears that the Republican-controlled Congress of 1995 and 
1996 has helped Clinton fulfill more of his 1992 campaign promises than the 
Democratic-controlled Congress of 1993 and 1994 did. </p>
<p>Clinton wanted comprehensive welfare reform, but it wasn't passed until this 
year with Republican leadership. </p>
<p>Clinton wanted strong line-item veto authority, but he didn't push it with the 
Democratic Congress of 1993 because Democratic leaders made it clear 
they would pass only a weak line-item veto power that really wasn't any 
improvement. The Republican Congress passed the strong veto authority 
that Clinton wanted but delayed its effective date until the next presidential 
inaugural in the hope that a Republican would win the White House. </p>
<p>Clinton proposed broad health-care reforms in 1993, but the 
Democratic-run Congress couldn't agree on any single plan and gave up. 
This year Clinton and the Republican-run Congress backed modest 
health-care reforms affecting only a minority of consumers and got them 
passed. </p>
<p>Clinton promised in 1992 to cut the budget deficit in half if elected. The 
deficit was $290billion in the 1992 fiscal year of Republican George Bush's 
presidency, which had to deal with a Democratic-controlled Congress. So, 
Clinton's goal was to get the deficit to $145billion by this year. </p>
<p>The Democratic-run Congress of 1993 and 1994 did reduce the deficit 
$87billion -- more than half of Clinton's $145billion goal. But much of that 
reduction came from tax increases aimed mostly at upper-income taxpayers. </p>
<p>In the last two fiscal years, under Republican congressional rule, the annual 
deficit dropped more by an estimated $86billion to $94billion. The final 
deficit total for the 1996 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, is to be 
announced at the end of this month. It will be somewhere between 
$109billion and $117billion, Republican and Democratic budget experts say. </p>
<p>So, it is already clear that Clinton's deficit goal has been exceeded, thanks in 
part to the Republican Congress. </p>
<p>Beyond that, Democrats and Republicans each have their separate 
successes to crow about. </p>
<p>Republicans can point to their seven-year plan to balance the federal budget, 
which they got passed in the House and Senate but never got Clinton to 
support. One can argue with the types and amounts of the cuts in the 
package -- and Clinton did, strongly -- but it was historic to pass a plan to 
balance the budget: 1969 was the last year the budget was in balance, 
thanks to a tax hike during the Johnson administration. </p>
<p>Also, Republicans passed reforms in major farm subsidy programs, which 
could reap billions of dollars of savings years from now. Liberal Democrats 
ran Congress for most of the previous 40 years and did little to achieve 
major savings in farm programs. </p>
<p>Democrats can point to their refusal to accept deep -- and they claimed 
dangerous -- Republican budget cuts in environmental, education and other 
important programs. Republicans allowed the government to be shut down 
several times for lack of additional spending authority to pressure Clinton to 
accept the deep cuts, but most public opinion seemed to side with Clinton's 
refusal, and Republicans lessened the cuts. </p>
<p>The voters will decide in just a little over two weeks which party can set next 
year's agenda in Congress and the White House. </p>

        grumblers turn up their volume about how there is no one
        worth voting for in the federal elections. </p>
        <p>So, they don't vote. Only about half of the eligible
        Americans are expected to go to the polls Tuesday to help
        make major decisions on who will lead this country from
        the White House and who will represent Tennesseans in Congress. </p>
        <p>That's a very troubling statistic considering that in
        the last half of the last century, 80percent of adults
        routinely voted for president. We're already at the point
        where a majority of people often don't vote. </p>
        <p>Consider the future danger, if the trend continues,
        where a minority of voters would be able to elect a
        zealot, an idiot or worse to the top offices in our land.
        The danger of electing an extremist candidate on either
        end of the spectrum could become a reality. </p>
        <p>A liberal extremist could impose dozens of new
        government restrictions: Perhaps no one would be able to
        own a gun; maybe taxes would rise much, much higher; gay
        marriages might be sanctioned by law. A conservative extremist
        might try to shut down all the public schools, give
        preference to one religion's schools and start breaking
        down the walls between church and government. </p>
        <p>Yes, it's sad that voters this year can choose only
        among three major presidential candidates who have
        serious flaws. But a voter studying all of their
        positions and their backgrounds can find one who is the
        least objectionable to each voter. That's the one each
        voter should select. There are no perfect candidates;
        everyone has weaknesses in some areas. </p>
        <p>The presidential candidates' weaknesses are more
        pronounced because they get more scrutiny than any other
        political candidates in the country. People know very
        little about their school board representative's background
        and weaknesses, but we know too much about the White House
        contenders. </p>
        <p>U.S. Senate and U.S. House races also are very
        important. Even if you aren't excited about any of the
        persons running, you can learn which one bothers you the
        least by talking to friends, colleagues at work, your
        fellow worshipers at church, and, yes, from reading this
        newspaper regularly. </p>
        <p>It's not wise, however, to judge a candidate based on
        only one issue. You may love a candidate's view on crime
        prevention but hate his or her view on what programs to
        cut to help balance the budget. So, by talking to a
        variety of people about candidates, one can cut through a
        lot of the candidates' baloney and get to their important
        differences. </p>
        <p>The news media get a lot of criticism from readers who
        think too much bad news is emphasized about one candidate
        and too much favorable news is played up for another.
        Totally balanced news coverage is a good goal but an
        impossible one. Editors and reporters try to do their
        best, but people often disagree on priorities in news
        stories. </p>
        <p>A couple of elections ago, one Tennessee newspaper in
        another city ran page-one stories every day about a
        prominent race, telling each candidate to provide the
        newspaper something new every day. This attempt at balance
        resulted in a lot of sniping back and forth between the
        candidates and wasn't very enlightening for voters. </p>
        <p>Casting an informed vote in local, state or national
        elections every one to four years is part of our homework
        as citizens in a democracy. We often don't enjoy doing it
        -- just like we don't enjoy some of the work we have to do
        at the office -- but we know it has to be done. It's the
        price we pay to keep living in a free country that is not
        ruled by idiots. </p>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->        <font size="5">V</font>ice President Al Gore won't have
        long to enjoy his election to a second term before the
        Republicans return to Congress and start probing his
        attendance at a fund-raising event in a Buddhist temple. </p>
        <p>He was able to deflect the issue successfully in the
        last weeks of the campaign, but now it would seem to be
        in his and the country's interest to get out the details
        of the fund-raiser as quickly as possible. If there was wrongdoing,
        it should be addressed quickly. If there wasn't, then
        everyone can forget about it. </p>
        <p>Gore is not being accused of wrongdoing at the temple,
        but the event has raised many questions. He has said that
        he did not know that members of the audience, invited by
        Democratic fund-raisers, were making donations to attend.
        He has said he thought the April event in California was
        a community outreach effort by the party. </p>
        <p>Many in both major parties agree that it was wrong and
        probably illegal to hold a fund-raiser in a religious
        institution. Gore has said mistakes were made. </p>
        <p>Gore could spare himself a lot of grief next year if
        he could pressure the Democratic National Committee to
        get the facts out quickly regarding the Buddhist temple
        event. Some fund-raising official or officials should be
        fired over the incident, and the party needs to tighten
        controls over who is solicited for funds. </p>
        <p>News reporters already have talked to some members of
        the audience who said they made donations to the DNC at
        the temple. Gore has been embarrassed by the bad
        publicity over the event. The Justice Department -- or
        more likely a special prosecutor -- will have to
        determine if there was criminal wrongdoing. </p>
        <p>One incident at the event, if true, was certainly
        illegal. A Buddhist nun said she was paid $5,000 in cash
        by someone to write a check to the DNC for that amount.
        Such money-laundering is not allowed. </p>
        <p>The Federal Election Commission is investigating the
        matter, but the agency is notoriously slow in its probes
        due to a high workload competing against a low staffing
        level. </p>
        <p>Democrats need to act fast on the Buddhist temple
        bungle so it doesn't drag out until the next presidential
        campaign. Gore, remember, wants to run for president
        during the next four years. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Gore's many campaign trips to the state
        this year -- 16 or so -- appear to have paid off for him.
        He did help Clinton carry his home state and pick up 11
        electoral votes. </p>
        <p>It also made sense for Gore to prove he still could
        win in his own state since he plans to run for president
        in the year 2000. But they didn't win by much. If Dole
        had carried only 2 percent more of the vote, about 45,000
        more votes out of nearly 2 million cast, it could have
        been a Dole state. </p>
        <p>Gore's two previous statewide Senate contests in
        Tennessee made winning look easy for him. He got 68
        percent of the vote in 1990 and 61 percent in 1984. </p>
        <p>With Clinton at the top of the ticket, however, Gore
        and Clinton could attract less than half of the votes
        cast in Tennessee -- 48 percent to Dole's 46 and Ross
        Perot's 6 percent total. </p>
        <p>Clinton and Gore now likely will devise more
        high-profile reform projects for Gore. Polls have shown
        that most voters want the federal government to be much
        smaller, much cheaper and more efficient. If Clinton-Gore
        cannot make enough progress in this area the next four
        years, voters will put a Republican in the White House in
        2000. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">T</font>his past election is a prime
        example of why imposing term limits on members of
        Congress would not be enough to guarantee an adequate supply
        of fresh, sharp minds over reasonable periods of time. </p>
        <p>In the Nov. 5 general election, 95 percent of
        incumbent members of the House and Senate who sought
        re-election were re-elected. In nearly every case,
        incumbents were able to raise the most money, and that
        was a major factor in their ability to advertise,
        organize and win. </p>
        <p>All Tennessee incumbents in Congress who sought
        re-election succeeded. </p>
        <p>Term limits advocates usually talk about requiring
        House and Senate members to leave Congress after 12 years
        of service to allow people with fresh perspectives to
        tackle the ongoing major problems. With incumbents' financial
        advantages, a great majority of them would be able to
        serve the full 12-year limit. The U.S. president and many
        governors can serve no longer than eight years, a period
        many consider long enough to make important public
        service contributions. </p>
        <p>Many of the best and brightest in our communities
        don't seek public office because incumbents have too many
        advantages in fund raising and taxpayer subsidies. </p>
        <p>If the political process is ever going to rise
        significantly in public esteem, it must become a more
        fluid and fair system. Imagine the major changes for the
        better that could come to Congress much more quickly if
        voters elected more intelligent, pleasant, nonpolitical
        people who are teachers, nurses, corporate executives,
        financial planners, etc. </p>
        <p>Going down the list of Tennessee winners in this
        month's election, one can see the pattern toward victory:
        Bill Jenkins of Rogersville won retiring Rep. Jimmy
        Quillen's seat this year while well known as a judge,
        state legislator and TVA board member. John J. Duncan Jr.
        of Knoxville won first in 1988 while well known as a Knox
        County Criminal Court judge and son of the sitting House
        member, who had died. </p>
        <p>Zach Wamp of Chattanooga was well known as Hamilton
        County Republican Party chairman when he barely lost in
        1992 by 3,000 votes. Incumbent Rep. Marilyn Lloyd retired
        before Wamp ran a second time and won in 1994. </p>
        <p>Republican Van Hilleary of Grandview was not well
        known before he first ran in the Fourth District in 1994,
        but he used about $100,000 of his personal wealth to
        boost his campaign. </p>
        <p>Republican Bill Frist used several millions of his
        fortune in 1994 to run commercials boosting himself for
        the U.S. Senate and criticizing incumbent Democratic Sen.
        Jim Sasser. Frist won. </p>
        <p>Republican Fred Thompson won his first Senate campaign
        in 1994 after becoming well known from 20 movie roles and
        his high-profile work on the Senate Watergate Committee
        and from challenging Gov. Ray Blanton's firing of the
        state parole board chairman. </p>
        <p>Being well-known or wealthy helps one steamroll over
        the competition. Having a great message doesn't help much
        unless you have the big money to advertise it. </p>
        <p>Through September, Jenkins outraised his challenger
        $346,000 to $16,000, and Duncan outdid his opponent
        $667,000 to $17,000. </p>
        <p>Wamp's funding advantage was $834,000 to $388,000;
        Hilleary raised $992,000 to his opponent's $441,000.
        Thompson's Senate campaign raised $3.6million to his
        opponent's $615,000. </p>
        <p>Incumbents also usually collect much more money from
        interest groups than challengers do, although a few
        members, including Wamp and Hilleary, don't accept
        groups' money. Banning groups' campaign donations would help
        level the playing field. </p>
        <p>Also, the National Taxpayers Union long has complained
        about how unfair -- and wasteful -- it is for incumbents
        to use tax dollars to prepare, print and mail large
        amounts of material that brag about their activities to
        voters. NTU has tried to get Congress to ban the practice
        entirely or at least stop it during election years, but
        incumbents so far have ignored the pleas. </p>

		<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>ennessee Sen. Fred Thompson seems determined to avoid the black eye that Sen. Al D&#39;Amato got from two years of excessive criticism of President Clinton.
<P>   Thompson, expected to be chairman of a committee that may investigate potential scandals involving the White House and Democratic National Committee, was given a chance recently on network television to threaten Clinton with possible impeachment if he replaced his attorney general or an independent prosecutor as a way to tone down investigations of White House officials, including Clinton and his wife Hillary.
<P>   He did not take the CBS-TV interviewer&#39;s bait.
<P>   &#39;&#39;If I do wind up handling part or all of the investigations in these areas, one of my main jobs is going to be to not say provocative things. I&#39;m not going to comment on things like that,&#39;&#39; Thompson said.
<P>   As the former minority counsel on the Senate Watergate Committee in the mid-1970s and as a former assistant U.S. attorney, Thompson knows that initial suspicions and evidence often don&#39;t lead where many think they will. Allegations or threats that one makes today can look very stupid or careless a year or two from now.
<P>   History shows that Thompson and former Tennessee Sen. Howard Baker Jr., both Republicans working on the Watergate Committee, initially believed the investigation of the White House coverup of the Watergate complex burglary would implicate someone below President Nixon and not Nixon himself. But Nixon clearly was implicated later by tape recordings of his conversations, forcing him to resign.
<P>   D&#39;Amato of New York was so partisan and reckless and slow moving when he headed the Senate probe of the Clintons&#39; Whitewater investments that he blew much of his credibility. A poll in the days before the general election showed D&#39;Amato&#39;s negatives in his home state had risen considerably, giving him many fences to mend before he runs again in 1998.
<P>   Thompson has suggested that he would not drag out investigations of the Clintons if given jurisdiction by his party&#39;s leadership. His policy would be to investigate quickly and thoroughly, and then move on to other things.
<P>   In a divided state like Tennessee, Thompson cannot afford to alienate the large number of independent and Democratic voters by appearing overly partisan and reckless. So, he is proceeding cautiously.
<P>   If Thompson is chosen to lead the probe of campaign finance problems by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton-Gore campaign, he can come out a winner even if he cannot prove any heinous, deliberate actions. If he appears fair and even-handed in the probe, he will get more positive national exposure in the news media.
<P>   Of course, if he proves deliberate wrongdoing by the party, he will receive even bigger national exposure.
<P>   Another danger in such a probe is that Democrats on Thompson&#39;s committee would emphasize that both parties are guilty of receiving campaign donations from questionable sources. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., for example, reportedly accepted political donations from foreign entities.
<P>   Also, the Republican National Committee has been accused of accepting donations from foreign operations of companies.
<P>   Voters of both major parties could benefit from investigations of campaign finance abuses by both parties because it might force Congress to finally pass substantial reforms. Voters are tired of hearing about abuses and sneaky ways of getting campaign donations and about the scary influence that interest groups have over federal legislators.
<P>   Thompson is one of several senators pushing for campaign finance reform, including a ban on interest groups&#39; donations to campaigns. A broad congressional probe into campaign financing problems, regardless of who leads it, could achieve the broadest campaign reforms since the Watergate scandal.

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">C</font>ongress finally is starting to use
        more common sense in how it maintains America's jewels,
        its national parks. </p>
        <p>The Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee
        and North Carolina, for example, has operated more than
        60 years but only last week was given authority to keep a
        significant portion of any fees it charged for services.
        All the park revenues in the past, except for a small
        reimbursement for fee collection costs, went to the U.S.
        Treasury and private companies holding the concessions
        contracts. </p>
        <p>Most other national parks and monuments were in the
        same situation. Washington officials got most of the
        revenue and decided how it would be spent, while parks
        complained annually about their unmet needs and inability
        to do anything about it. </p>
        <p>The Smokies still will have many unmet needs -- roads
        and trails going without repairs and understaffing in
        some areas until more funds can be obtained -- because
        the new system is just an experiment with a small fee. </p>
        <p>For years, tour groups have taken the leisurely,
        scenic hay wagon tour through Cades Cove in the Smokies,
        paying $6 a person. The bulk of the fees went to the
        contractor, and a small franchise fee was paid to the
        U.S. Treasury. Under the three-year pilot program, the
        Smokies will get to keep $1.60 of whatever fee is charged
        per person for the wagon ride and tour. </p>
        <p>The fee will allow the Smokies management to hire a
        tour guide for the wagon tour, making it more interesting
        and giving the park a chance to better showcase itself to
        visitors. A small amount of money will be left over after
        paying the guide to help with other needs. </p>
        <p>The beauty of the new fee system is that it likely
        will lead to other reasonable user fees in which the park
        gets to keep 80percent. With more revenues, the park can
        be more attractive and its officials can be more confident
        of a solid, adequate operations budget to deal with the
        largest visitation of any national park in the United
        States. </p>
        <p>People who visit a national park for just an afternoon
        on the way somewhere else likely don't think much about
        the costs involved in running it. A family stops to eat
        and throws all its plates, napkins, cups, cans, food packaging
        and other refuse from the car into park trash or
        recycling cans. With 9million visitors a year, the park
        gets a mountain of refuse and has to hire a company to
        collect it every day. </p>
        <p>Many of those 9million also stop to use the restrooms,
        incurring obvious expense for the water, solid waste
        collection, cleaning, etc. </p>
        <p>Visitors also get free information about the park at
        the visitor's center, but there are costs for the paper,
        printing and employees answering questions and giving
        talks. The heavy traffic in the park also wears down the
        roads, trails and other facilities, requiring costly,
        periodic maintenance. </p>
        <p>The Smokies still does not have an entrance fee, as
        most national parks do, so it remains one of the best
        bargains around. </p>
        <p>Other popular national parks are being allowed to
        increase their entrance fees under the trial program
        allowing them to keep 80percent for local needs. The
        Everglades in Florida, for example, will raise its
        entrance fee person from $3 to $5, still a bargain for
        that wildlife wonder of the world. </p>
        <p>Canyon National Park will hike its entrance fee from
        $4 to $10 per person and won't become any less popular.
        People know that most attractions have a fee to maintain
        them, just as amusement parks and movie theaters have to
        charge a fee for their cost of doing business. </p>

		<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>ost members of the Tennessee delegation agree that one of the most forward-thinking bills they passed this year was welfare reform.
<P>   It remains to be seen if it was one of the wisest measures they passed.
<P>   The goals are noble, logical and should have been pursued by previous leaders of Congress decades ago. The political chemistry finally was right in Washington to squeeze out passage of a compromise.
<P>   The federal government had proven every year for 61 years that simply giving poor people enough money to keep them poor but alive was not going to make many of them independent and happy.
<P>   There is no doubt that the reforms will save billions of dollars for taxpayers over the long term. Fewer people receiving benefits will create definite savings. The projection is for $55 billion in lower projected spending over the next six years.
<P>   Several key questions, however, remain to be answered as the rest of the states without welfare reform programs set them up to meet the federal standards.
<P>    Tennessee, of course, already has its own reform program in place.
<P>   Can millions of able-bodied welfare recipients get adequate training in two years to find a mandatory job that pays as much or more than welfare benefits? Will they be able to keep such a job for a long time? Many welfare recipients either dropped out of high school or did not do well in high school. Their ability to be trained for good jobs in their community is open to much uncertainty.
<P>   Will there be enough child care for the children of the working welfare recipients? Will there be adequate transportation for welfare beneficiaries to get to training classes and later to jobs?
<P>   Many of the jobs one reads about now are for highly skilled people in certain areas or low-skilled jobs that pay very little. Are welfare recipients doomed to go from one low-paying job to another until they die?
<P>   And what will happen to the legal immigrants who are not U.S. citizens and are losing their welfare benefits under the new law? Will they find friends or relatives to help them? Will they become beggars on the street? Will charities be able to help many of them?
<P>   After a while it likely will become obvious that most welfare recipients need more than two years of training to get good enough jobs to make them and their children independent for the long term. Life-time welfare benefits are capped at five years under the new federal law.
<P>   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., agrees that it is not clear if there will be enough decent-paying jobs for all able-bodied welfare program persons.
<P>   The largest cities with the biggest welfare populations, such as Washington, D.C., New York City, Chicago, Memphis and many other places don&#39;t have an abundance of low-skill jobs.
<P>   But, as Thompson has said, Congress could not keep delaying welfare reforms because of uncertainty over whether everyone can find jobs. Losing financial assistance from the government, one&#39;s parents or a friend is a powerful incentive to seek training and a job.
<P>   How many children will become destitute and homeless because of the reforms?
<P>    Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., has said 1.1million children will become impoverished, and he cites an Urban Institute study as his source. How he would make large numbers of welfare recipients independent remains a mystery.
<P>   Congress is determined to allow the reforms a chance. No doubt modifications will be needed in the next year or two because federal officials never create a major new program that runs perfectly as planned.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Richard Powelson, News-Sentinel Washington bureau chief</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> Knox County poll before last month&#39;s election showed, not surprisingly, that most people considered crime the top issue facing the state.
<P>    President Clinton no doubt got similar information from his national polls, explaining why he spent so much time talking about his proposal to put an extra 100,000 police officers on the street. Congress probably never will fund all those 100,000 slots, but Clinton won many votes from people glad to hear him talking about tougher measures against crime.
<P>    The second major concern of those polled in Knox County, inadequate education, is related to their top concern. Crime would be less of a problem if schools and home environments better prepared children to become responsible, hard-working citizens.
<P>    If public school administrators were more forward-thinking, they would adopt some ideas pushed earlier by former governor Lamar Alexander and currently by the Edison Project&#39;s school management company. Both favor longer school days and school years to give children more skills, and more relevant skills, for jobs that may not exist for another 10 years.
<P>    In a well-planned school environment, the longer time at school keeps the children more stimulated to learn. Their minds are more focused on the wonders of the world, past, present and future. They have less time to wander around neighborhoods with friends and get into mischief, to experiment with illegal drugs and less time to become part of the national crime epidemic.
<P>* 
<P>    Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., used to long-range planning from his many years in medical school and post-graduate study in surgery and transplants, can teach Congress a few things about setting goals and sticking to them.
<P>    Frist already has planned what he will be doing in the year 2007 or 2001, depending on whether he is elected to a second and last six-year term in the year 2000. He said recently he will return to heart and lung transplant surgery, his profession before winning his Senate race in 1994, in keeping with his 1994 campaign promise to seek no more than two six-year terms.
<P>   To keep somewhat current in medicine, Frist got a license to practice medicine in Washington so he can see patients at a clinic occasionally in his spare time.
<P>* 
<P>    Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., has been receiving incredibly upbeat and widespread national publicity since he was chosen as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee and given responsibility, starting next year, to ferret out wrongdoing in campaign fund raising before the November election.
<P>    Time magazine, Business Week, Washington Monthly, the Baltimore Sun and the Washington Post have been singing his praises the last couple of weeks. Some writers cannot resist suggesting that Thompson could make a popular presidential candidate in four years.
<P>    Boosters of Rep. John J. Duncan Jr. of Knoxville like that talk of Thompson running for president. If Thompson won, they reason, and if a Republican still was Tennessee&#39;s governor, then Duncan would have a good shot at being named to Thompson&#39;s Senate seat until a special election could be held.
<P>    Duncan passed up a chance to run for the state&#39;s open Senate seat in 1994 that Thompson was encouraged to seek and later won. Whether Duncan would accept such an appointment, and still have to campaign statewide to get elected in a special election, remains to be determined.
<P>    All this talk of Thompson being a good presidential candidate, of course, is just talk. He has never said he would like to be president some day, and his friends say he would not be interested in flying all over the country seeking campaign funds and votes. Besides, his friend Lamar Alexander seems determined to run again for president in 2000, giving Thompson a good excuse to remain on track in the Senate.

        <p><font size="6"><br>
        </font>Several members of the Tennessee congressional
        delegation were involved in good deeds or good fortune in
        1996 and deserve more recognition at this time of the
        year. </p>
        <p>Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., got an amendment passed
        to block a 3percent pay raise for senators, a raise which
        would have cost taxpayers $400,000 extra per year on top
        of senators' annual salaries of $133,600. </p>
        <p>However, it did not make him very popular with his
        colleagues. If the Senate had a Christmas party, Thompson
        likely would find in his stocking exactly 99 lumps of
        coal. But his move played well in his state. </p>
        <p>Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., signed an organ donor card,
        designating his vital organs for transplant to a person
        in need should he die prematurely. Frist also held
        high-profile hearings on the need for more organ donors,
        and got several other senators to sign pledges to donate
        their organs. </p>
        <p>Also, Frist, a transplant surgeon before his election
        in 1994, saved a second person's life. After the
        Republican National Convention, while in Montecito,
        Calif., Frist was present in a restaurant when an
        84-year-old woman was choking badly on her food. </p>
        <p>When another witness' attempt at aid failed, Frist
        dislodged the food manually with his fingers. In 1995, he
        helped revive a man in cardiac arrest in Frist's Senate
        office building. </p>
        <p>Knoxville Rep. John J. Duncan Jr. won passage of a
        bill requiring airlines to share background information
        on pilots to prevent dangerous or substandard pilots from
        moving from one airline to another after being fired. The
        bill, in the long term, could improve air safety and save
        lives. </p>
        <p>Rep. Jimmy Quillen, a Kingsport Republican retiring at
        the end of the year, gave away $150,000 of his surplus
        campaign funds to an East Tennessee college and a
        hospice. More such donations are promised. </p>
        <p>He could have used the funds for future political
        activity: donations to other politicians or travel, food
        and lodging at a variety of U.S. political events. But he
        found the charitable, nonprofit groups more deserving of
        the leftover funds. In earlier years he also had donated
        campaign funds in similar ways. </p>
        <p>Rep. Van Hilleary, a Grandview Republican, made many
        of 60,000 lake structure owners happy in the Tennessee
        Valley when he managed to get Congress to approve his
        amendment to block TVA officials from moving ahead with a
        proposal to impose a $1,000 deposit on future owners of
        each structure to ensure proper maintenance for safety. </p>
        <p>The bill also blocked TVA this fiscal year from
        charging a deposit of any other amount to allow more time
        for discussion of the pros and cons. TVA then began
        exploring fines as an option to make sure there is a way
        to pay for removal or repair of dangerous lake
        structures: boat docks, boat houses, shore walls, etc. </p>
        <p>In the good fortune category, Rep. Zach Wamp, a
        Chattanooga Republican, won his bid to be named to the
        powerful Appropriations Committee. That panel plays Santa
        year round, doling out federal dollars to projects that
        catch its fancy. Wamp represents a region with the
        largest TVA employment and the Oak Ridge federal
        reservation, where there are thousands of federal
        contract employees. TVA has about 1,000 employees paid
        with federal funds from a roughly $100million annual
        federal budget. </p>
        <p>Congress is cutting many federal programs' budgets
        every year to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002.
        Tennessee programs should have a better chance of getting
        fair treatment after Wamp develops some influence on the
        panel. He won't be able to protect Oak Ridge and TVA and
        other programs from any cuts, but he should have a good
        chance of preventing unfair levels of cutbacks. </p>

        Democrat Mark Stewart are going through their 4th
        District congressional campaign without a debate, some speculation
        may be in order about how such an encounter might go. </p>
        <p>Maybe it would run something like this, after the
        moderator introductions and the usual opening statements: </p>
        <p>Moderator: ''So tell us a bit about yourself and why
        you're running. Mr. Stewart first. </p>
        <p>Stewart: ''Well, you know, I grew up down in Franklin
        County and I still live there with my wife and two
        children, teaching Sunday school, working with Boy Scouts
        and hunting with real guns, the kind that go 'boom' and
        that I want to protect from any control. </p>
        <p>''Now, I don't like name calling and would never
        engage in personal attacks, but my opponent is known as
        the accidental congressman because it was just an
        accident that he got elected. Then some folks call him
        Moving Van, 'cause he moved to Roane County -- that's
        outside the 4th district, you know -- to run for a state
        Senate seat and lose, then moved back into the district
        to run for Congress. Others just call him Rep. Hilarious,
        of course, because many of his positions on issues are a
        joke. </p>
        <p>''Take family values, for example. He doesn't even
        have a wife, much less children. His only family is Newt
        Gingrich and the rest of that Republican extremist gang
        of greedy Washington cut-throat fat-cat scum who want to starve
        our senior citizens, outlaw education for children,
        increase pollution and sell all our Tennessee lakes to
        corporations. </p>
        <p>''Yes, this race presents a clear choice: Either you
        vote for Mr. Hilarious and destroy life on Earth as we
        know it or give me the opportunity to serve you by
        restoring decency, honor, justice, prosperity and family
        virtues to the America we all love.'' </p>
        <p>Moderator: ''Rep. Hilleary? </p>
        <p>Hilleary: ''Well, let me say that I was thinking about
        my reasons for serving this morning when I was walking
        through a tobacco field with Fred the farmer. And, you
        know, I decided that it's for all the fine folks like the tobacco
        farmers of the district, who are all under attack by
        liberal Democrats like my opponent, an attack that could
        wreck the lives of thousands of families. </p>
        <p>''I care about farmers 'cause I care about eating. My
        mom is the best cook in the world. And I do have a
        family, too. </p>
        <p>''Frankly, I'm not sure that a man who works as hard
        as I do -- 14-hour days, serving the people of this
        district -- can devote as much time as he should to a
        wife and children. But I favor term limits, and my time
        will come for that. Meanwhile, I'm working for family
        values in Congress. Why, even Dan Quayle -- Mr. Family
        Values -- came into the district to say so. </p>
        <p>''I come from a business background, and I'm a Desert
        Storm veteran. I work hard and I'm honest. My opponent
        may look like Opie -- Andy's son in that old TV show,
        Mayberry, R.F.D. -- but that's part of his overall plot of
        purposeful dishonesty in everything he does and says. </p>
        <p>''You see, opponent Opie is really a trial lawyer.
        That means he makes his living defending criminals. </p>
        <p>''Opie has taken all his money from big labor goons
        and trial lawyers and is beholden to them now. I don't
        take PAC money, you know. The election is a choice:
        Between my conservative values and a criminal-coddling, lawyering-liberal,
        labor union yo-yo.'' </p>
        <p>Stewart: ''Wrong! You're a pawn of the big-business
        fat-cat special interests that give you all your money.
        And you're a hypocrite for saying you don't take PAC
        money, since you do take lobbyist money. I, on the other hand,
        am praised and endorsed by Al Gore, a true hero to all
        Tennesseans. You are a Newt clone!'' </p>
        <p>Hilleary: ''Am not! And Fred Thompson supports me. And
        Fred can beat up Prince Albert in any popularity contest.
        Ditto with Bill Frist and Don Sundquist. You're a Ted
        Kennedy clone.'' </p>
        <p>Stewart: ''Am not, Newt-lover!'' </p>
        <p>Hilleary: ''Are so, Kennedy-clone!'' </p>
        <p>And so on. </p>

        taxes in '97<!--SUBHEAD--></b></font><p><font size="2"><i>By Tom
        Humphrey News-Sentinel Nashville bureau</i></font></p>
        <p><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>here's something of a crisis cycle
        in state government budgets, which by curious coincidence
        tend toward fat in years when politicians exercise on the
        campaign trail and lean in nonelection years when they
        are the campaigning equivalent of couch potatoes. </p>
        <p>Thus, former Gov. Ned McWherter's greatest budget
        crisis came in the nonelection year of 1991 -- just after
        his successful re-election run in the budgetary fat year
        of 1990. Ned hauled out the knife and trimmed for a
        while, advocating a state income tax as his idea for
        putting meat on the bones for the future. </p>
        <p>The income tax flopped, of course, but a
        half-cent-per-dollar increase in the state sales tax --
        earmarked for education improvements -- was approved in
        the aftermath of the income tax fizzle and
        cut-to-the-bone budgeting. The budget then got better,
        just as it has historically for a few years after every
        other tax increase. </p>
        <p>Things still looked pretty good back in 1994, when Don
        Sundquist trekked down campaign lane as a
        no-new-taxes-needed candidate for governor. But, by gosh,
        when he got into office in 1995, money was discovered to
        be short, and a crisis was at hand that required some
        cutting and patching. </p>
        <p>Through most of 1996, however, things were good again
        -- at least good enough so that each legislator got a
        nice chunk of pork for pre-election distribution into his
        district, state employees and teachers got a pay raise
        and other somewhat costly good deeds could be done. </p>
        <p>Now, however, it appears there was a bit of campaign
        year miscalculating in Tennessee last year so that the
        100th General Assembly will arrive in Nashville next week
        coincidentally facing a $100million shortfall in the
        1996-97 fiscal revenue collections. </p>
        <p>Further, it is projected that Tennessee is embarking
        on its third century of statehood with a coincidental
        $300million shortfall looming for the new fiscal year
        that begins on July 1. </p>
        <p>So it's cutting time again. It's also time, not
        coincidentally, for some things that are as predictable
        as a budget problem in a nonelection year. These include:
        </p>
        <p>* Rumors that an income-tax advocate still exists
        somewhere deep in the subterranean sections of Capitol
        Hill corridors, prompting politicians to issue news
        releases and statements of alarm over the possibility and
        further declare their willingness to fight that son of a
        gun to the death if it ever raises its ugly head. </p>
        <p>* State employee and teacher leaders expressing
        skepticism about a budget deficit really existing in a
        time of economic growth or at least not one big enough to
        mean the rank-and-file folks get no pay raise this year. </p>
        <p>* Political battle lines forming over what's cut and
        what's not. </p>
        <p>Some of these battles will be fought pretty much in
        public view. But most will occur quietly as bureaucrats,
        politicians and special interest representatives haggle
        privately over a few thousand dollars here, a couple of
        million there, in the quest to reach the targeted
        $300million in cutting for Tennessee's third century. </p>
        <p>While all of this is fairly predictable by a look back
        at historical coincidences, there is one striking
        difference from bygone days: There's no chance that
        anyone will advocate a tax increase to avoid any
        cutbacks. </p>
        <p>The sales tax has about peaked out, and no one in
        political sight has the nerve of Ned to seek a higher
        rate. So many of our political leaders have run on a
        no-new-tax pledge, as did Sundquist, that it is not an
        option. </p>
        <p>Oh, even the governor will say that he just maybe,
        perhaps, could be thinking about considering the
        possibility of shrinking a loophole or two -- for
        example, the one created a couple years ago by a law that
        lets businesses escape taxes by calling themselves
        limited liability corporations. </p>
        <p>That leaves elimination of tax exemptions, each
        protected by a politically entrenched special interest,
        and an income tax, unthinkable politically. For today's
        politicians, cutting $300million is a piece of cake when
        compared to tackling either of those options. </p>
        <p>In Tennessee, then, today's tax status quo is
        untouchable and will remain so for some years yet. Things
        will have to get a lot worse, revenue-wise, before that
        changes. In the meantime, don't fret too much. An
        election year is coming up in 1998 and, to make a New
        Year's prediction 12 months in advance, we can be sure
        that things will get a lot better then. </p>

        <p><br>
        <font size="5">S</font>tate government's revolving door
        has been spinning rapidly for a long time now and is
        unlikely to stop anytime soon, despite such occasional
        efforts by reformer types. </p>
        <p>The primary reasons are simple: (1) Too many people of
        power and influence don't like the idea of blocking
        government policy-makers from future profit-making, (2)
        the only people who pay much attention to the matter are
        -- for the most part -- people of power and influence and
        (3) reformers never seem to get their act together. </p>
        <p>All elements were illustrated by the lay of the
        landscape last week when the leaders of Tennessee Citizen
        Action and Common Cause were calling for an
        anti-revolving door law. The idea is to forbid government
        officials from leaving their public posts and taking jobs
        that involve influencing government officials -- at least
        for a year or so after leaving office. </p>
        <p>Gov. Don Sundquist's cabinet provides a fine example
        of the revolving-door phenomenon, which is in keeping
        with a tradition observed by those who held power under
        governors past. </p>
        <p>A case study could be Nancy Menke, who cut her teeth
        in governmental doings as a lobbyist for the Tennessee
        State Employees Association. Now she can be found
        standing beside the governor as he criticizes TSEA for a
        reputation of unreasonableness in its demands for pay
        increases. </p>
        <p>The latest spin of the revolving door has left Menke
        as commissioner of the new Department of Public Health,
        salaried at $120,000 per year. (She is smart and savvy
        enough to doubtless earn more than that elsewhere.) </p>
        <p>Since her TSEA days in the 1980s, she has revolved
        into a private sector contract lobbyist for folks such as
        Corrections Corporation of America, then into a job as
        the governor's lobbyist, then into a job as a key
        governor policy adviser on issues including prisons, then
        back to the private lobbying format, then back to take
        the commissioner's job. </p>
        <p>The governor's new legal counsel, Courtney Pearre, is
        a former lobbyist and, in all likelihood, will lobby
        again. Ditto for Hardy Mays, who Pearre replaced as legal
        counsel and who is now deputy to the governor and chief
        of staff. </p>
        <p>Ditto again for Peaches Simpkins, who has served as
        private sector lobbyist when not holding government
        positions under governors Ned McWherter, Lamar Alexander
        or Ray Blanton -- and who is now in the private sector. </p>
        <p>Legislators revolve, too. Probably at least a third of
        the current corps of lobbyists working the Legislature
        are former legislators. Probably a lot of current
        legislators want to become lobbyists someday and make
        more than the $16,500 per year that we taxpayers give
        them. </p>
        <p>Less frequently, former lobbyists also revolve through
        the door to become legislators. For example, freshman
        state Rep. Gene Caldwell, D-Oak Ridge, campaigned as a
        man experienced in government because of his lobbying on
        behalf of causes he supported as a pediatrician. </p>
        <p>Some lobbyists duly noted last week that Brian
        McGuire, director of Tennessee Citizen Action, tried to
        revolve from lobbyist to legislator during the 1996
        campaign and joked that he ''got stuck in the revolving
        door.'' </p>
        <p>(McGuire lost in the Democratic primary last August to
        state Rep. Bill Boner, D-Nashville, who -- in some
        remarkable intragovernment revolving -- has moved from
        the state House to the U.S. Congress, to Nashville mayor
        and back to the state House.) </p>
        <p>While folks of power and influence enjoy the
        revolving-door ride, the opposition has long seemed
        simply dizzy. Anti-revolving-door bills have surfaced in
        past legislative sessions but always have spun off into
        oblivion. </p>
        <p>What is needed, of course, is a good lobbyist to work
        things out and get an anti-revolving door bill passed.
        Trouble is, nobody seems willing to hire him or her and
        pay the bill. </p>
        <p>OOPS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: In this space last week, it was
        wrongly indicated that Gov. Sundquist's commissioners had
        recently responded to a survey soundly trashing their
        boss' idea for putting all department lawyers into a
        central pool. Not so, advises Sundquist press spokeswoman
        Beth Fortune. The survey was taken back in 1995, when it
        was simply being studied by the Sundquist-appointed
        Commission on Practical Government. </p>

TEETH </h2>
<p><em>By Tom Humphrey, News-Sentinel Nashville Bureau</em></p>
<p>The Tennessee Plan, as our new model Supreme Court selection vehicle 
was christened by creators back in 1994, is certain to be towed into the old 
legislative garage for an overhaul come next January.</p>
<p>In its first trip down the election road last week, the vehicle failed to get its 
front-seat passenger, Supreme Court Justice Penny J. White, to her desired 
destination of an extended term on the state's highest court.</p>
<p>Three other appeals court judges in the back seat, however, made the trip 
just fine, thank you, winning extended terms by 2-1 margins even as White 
went flying out the window after a very fast, very bumpy ride.</p>
<p>The yes-no referendum cart, which was designed with the safety of its 
judicial passengers very much in mind, thus showed a major defect insofar as 
the well-being of the more visible and more vulnerable front-seat folks.</p>
<p>The threshold question for legislative mechanics will be whether to declare 
the Supreme selection vehicle an unsalvageable wreck and send it to the 
junkyard, then go out to buy a new model.</p>
<p>At this point that seems unlikely, despite some pressure from both the legal 
community and partisan politicians for junking the current vehicle.</p>
<p>There was some quiet lawyerly talk about moving to lifetime appointments of 
judges, a vehicle already in use in the federal system to provide maximum 
insulation of judges from politics.</p>
<p>But the federal model is being much denounced lately, and it would be darn 
near impossible to sell to legislators and other state political powers.</p>
<p>Which leaves only one other basic model available in the judicial selection 
system showrooms across the nation -- the old contested election car 
previously used by Tennessee Supremes to successfully travel re-election 
roads.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the legal community -- which carries considerable weight as the 
only interest that typically cares enough about judicial selection vehicles to 
get involved in lobbying -- still finds extremely distasteful the idea of partisan 
squabbling over seats supposedly supremely above such things.</p>
<p>The upshot is that there is no consensus on changing things, a situation that 
favors the status quo. And there are other problems with swapping the 
Tennessee Plan for another model.</p>
<p>First of all, doing so would be, in effect, telling the electorate they were 
wrong in ousting White. That would be an extraordinarily bold political 
statement for legislators who, for the most part, ran for cover at the mention 
of White's name during the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Then there are those who think the Tennessee Plan actually strikes a pretty 
good balance between judicial independence and judicial accountability to 
the public that pays them.</p>
<p>Conservative populists, as exemplified by the fringe folks of the Tennessee 
Conservative Union, are also none too unhappy with the Tennessee Plan -- 
especially after last week's results.</p>
<p>On reflection, much of the legal community may conclude that the Tennessee 
Plan offers the lesser of evils, too. Though the electorate for the first time 
showed a willingness to boot a sitting judge, they also showed -- by 
re-electing three other appeals court judges -- that there is no locked-in 
``throw-the-bums-out'' mindset.</p>
<p>Indeed, the argument can be made that the Tennessee Plan vehicle worked 
last week -- and would have worked better if some of the still-missing parts 
had been in place. The major example is the evaluations of judges that were 
supposed to be conducted, with the result made public.</p>
<p>In 1998, everyone will know the yes-no vehicle better. The sitting Supremes 
can prepare themselves better than White did. Of course, so can those who 
want to bump some of the justices off the bench.</p>
<p>Just maybe, once those legislative mechanics look under the hood, they will 
decide the Tennessee Plan deserves at least one more run.</p>

ELECTIONS </h2>
<p><em>By Tom Humphrey, News-Sentinel Nashville bureau</em></p>
<p>In the 30 years since Howard Baker broke a traditional Democratic 
deadlock on statewide elections, Tennessee Republicans have soared, sank 
and soared again -- with a good bit of mediocre muddling in between. </p>
<p>The state party's future status is unclear as the Tennessee delegation heads 
to this week's Republican National Convention. But before they left, there 
was some GOP gloating afoot over the primary voting turnout in the Aug. 1 
elections. </p>
<p>Using unofficial U.S. Senate primary returns as an indicator, there were 
about 279,000 votes cast in the GOP primary on that date vs. about 
255,000 in the Democratic primary. </p>
<p>Proclaimed state Republican Chairman Jim Burnett at one point: ``We think 
that's the first time in state history it's happened.... I think it's very 
significant.'' </p>
<p>Well, actually, it's not the first time. Back in 1994, about 445,000 
Tennesseans voted in the six-candidate GOP Senate primary won by Bill 
Frist. (There was a big drop-off in the other GOP Senate primary, won by 
Fred Thompson, with just 336,615 votes cast.) </p>
<p>Only 403,000 voted in the Democratic primary for then-Sen. Jim Sasser and 
just 376,000 in the other Senate primary for Jim Cooper. Neither Democrat 
had any opposition, however, and the poll parade inspired by the heated 
six-pack primary could be explained as an aberration. </p>
<p>A more typical primary turnout was 1988, when 332,560 voted for the 
unopposed Sasser in the Democratic primary and just 158,112 in a 
three-candidate GOP primary won by Bill Andersen. </p>
<p>Democrats, including party chairman Will Cheek and Senate nominee 
Houston Gordon, see the 1996 Republican primary numbers as insignificant 
insofar as party dominance goes. </p>
<p>Cheek notes that turnout was only 19percent of the state's voters and sees 
the partisan alignment as a matter of right-wing zealots hitting the polls to 
cast out Supreme Court Justice Penny White and ``voting in the Republican 
primary while they were at it.'' </p>
<p>There were also some hotly contested Republican primary races, notably in 
the 1st congressional District. On the other hand, a record number of 
Republicans crossed over to vote in the 9th District Democratic primary. </p>
<p>In the traditionally Democratic 4th District, where both congressional 
primaries were foregone conclusions, the Democrat-Republican numbers 
were basically even. </p>
<p>The upshot, it seems, is that the core Republican vote in Tennessee is getting 
bigger than the core Democratic vote. At the same time, however, it may be 
that a growing percentage of Tennesseans don't have a partisan favorite and 
-- at least on Aug. 1, a lot of them didn't bother to vote. </p>
<p>Where those folks splash down come November, of course, will decide 
which party's candidates soar and which sink. </p>
<p>The state GOP's soar began with Baker's 1966 election and reached its 
peak a few years later, when the party held both U.S. Senate seats, the 
governor's office and even the state House speaker's post for a couple of 
years. </p>
<p>With aberrations, the Democrats then began to dominate things again -- a 
pattern that was clear by 1976 when Democrat Sasser removed Republican 
Sen. Bill Brock from office. </p>
<p>In 1986, Democrat Ned McWherter won the governor's office and 
succeeded Republican Lamar Alexander, and the Democrats once again 
held all three of the big statewide offices, not to mention a solid 6-3majority 
in the U.S. House delegation and complete dominance of the Legislature. </p>
<p>The tables were turned two years ago, of course, with a Republican sweep 
that followed -- or even surpassed -- a national trend. </p>
<p>If the historic pattern thus established holds true, 1996 should be a year of 
mediocre muddle for both parties -- but with Democrats beginning to climb 
out of the hole they fell into on statewide races. </p>
<p>After all, the GOP has a so-far-uninspiring presidential candidate at the top 
of a ticket -- a man who beat Tennessean Alexander along the way -- while 
Democrats are blessed with a presidential ticket including Tennessean Al 
Gore Jr. </p>
<p>If the GOP doesn't sink somewhat in November, that will be a more genuine 
indicator that a fundamental shift toward the GOP is under way. </p>
<p>A bigger Republican core vote may help, but only if it can drag along more 
of the masses in the middle. </p>

FOR 2000 </h2>
<p><em>By Tom Humphrey, News-Sentinel Nashville bureau</em></p>
<p>Tennessee's two presidential wannabes, Al Gore Jr. and Lamar Alexander, 
both have reason to be a bit nervous about the way things are shaping up for 
this fall's campaign season and the ramifications for the year 2000.</p>
<p>Vice President Gore, of course, wants to succeed President Clinton at the 
top of the Democratic ticket in four years -- regardless of whether Clinton 
wins or loses this fall. A win, naturally, would be preferred so that Gore 
could remain in the national limelight as heir apparent and maybe coast to a 
win in the primaries of 2000.</p>
<p>For Alexander's own personal best political interest, a Democratic victory in 
1996 would also surely be preferable by opening the door for a GOP 
presidential scramble four years hence -- though the former governor is 
striving to present himself as the strongest Dole backer. </p>
<p>Alexander got a lot of fairly favorable media attention at the GOP 
convention, being interviewed regularly by all sorts of national press people 
and TV -- though his brief video appearance on the convention screen was 
not aired on any of the major networks.</p>
<p>That said, however, Alexander's star may have faded a bit for now -- 
certainly in comparison to Jack Kemp, who suddenly finds himself well 
positioned for a run at the GOP nomination in 2000, regardless of whether 
Dole wins or loses.</p>
<p>A Dole win would leave the dream of President Alexander on hold until at 
least 2004 and probably until 2008. A Dole loss, should Kemp present 
himself well to a national audience, could still give him a leg up in seeking the 
nomination in 2000.</p>
<p>One hurdle that Kemp must clear is debating Gore, who certainly is no 
slouch in one-on-one rhetorical combat. Kemp just might be a more 
formidable debate opponent, however, than those Gore has previously met.</p>
<p>A less-noticed Gore problem, at least so far, is his possible vulnerability on 
the home front. It would look mighty bad for a man who wants to be 
president to lose in his home state of Tennessee come this fall.</p>
<p>Some Republicans are almost gleeful in pointing this out. Says state GOP 
Chairman Jim Burnett, perhaps overstating a bit: ``When Bob Dole carries 
Tennessee, it will basically end Al Gore's political career.''</p>
<p>Gore's awareness of the situation may be indicated by his increasingly 
frequent forays into Tennessee and some pretty bold attempts to grab 
favorable publicity in his homeland.</p>
<p>While polls have indicated that the Clinton-Gore team has been running 
ahead in Tennessee, the state is certainly a battleground. With Republican 
Sen. Fred Thompson's re-election race topping the state ticket and GOP 
congressmen and legislators going all out with money and time, it's at least 
conceivable that Tennessee could tilt into the Dole column even if Clinton 
wins nationally.</p>
<p>That would be an big embarrassment for Gore but probably not fatal to his 
presidential prospects, since he would still have that four more years in the 
limelight to promote himself.</p>
<p>A Clinton-Gore win in Tennessee, coupled with a national loss to the 
Republican ticket, could still make Gore look good -- the sort of thing that 
could be portrayed as an indicator of Gore's superior personal appeal when 
compared to Clinton's somewhat tarnished image.</p>
<p>A national loss combined with a Tennessee loss would be a lot more grim 
for Gore 2000. Thus cursed with a loser image, Gore would at least be 
faced with other Democratic presidential wannabes stepping forward with 
considerable hope in their hearts.</p>
<p>Perhaps Alexander, sitting on the sidelines during a Dole-Kemp 
administration and waiting to see whether Dole wants the 2000 nomination 
or hands it off to Kemp, could sympathize.</p>
<p>There would be no sympathy, of course, if we have four more years of 
Clinton -- and, very likely, four years of Alexander maneuvering to best 
Kemp and other comers in the 2000 primaries.</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>August 25, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>GOP NEEDS HELP IN RECRUITING 
BLACKS </h2>
<p><em>By Tom Humphrey, New-Sentinel Nashville bureau</em></p>
<p>Tennessee Republicans are planning an outreach program toward minority 
voters once again, a decade after the last such effort failed and a century or 
so since blacks deserted the party of Lincoln en masse.</p>
<p>The present push, which state GOP Chairman Jim Burnett acknowledges 
hasn't gotten much further than the talking stage, is partly a reflection of 
national Republican thinking.</p>
<p>Blacks remain a basic Democratic voting bloc, of course, and anything the 
GOP can do to chip away at it could mean a big payoff at the polls come 
election day. </p>
<p>The overtures at the national level were illustrated at the recent San Diego 
Republican Convention, where the script put a couple of black Republicans 
-- Colin Powell and Oklahoma U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts -- in spotlighted 
speeches. And last week, Bob Dole (having endured some criticism for 
snubbing an NAACP convention earlier) appeared before a black 
journalists' gathering at Nashville.</p>
<p>Yet only about 3 percent of all GOP delegates and alternates at San Diego 
were black. There were only two in the 76-member Tennessee delegation, a 
situation that one of them, state Revenue Commissioner Ruth Johnson, 
conceded indicates ``quite a challenge'' for the recruitment program. (There 
are 23 blacks among the 95-member Tennessee delegation to the 
Democratic Convention this week.)</p>
<p>Indeed, as a practical matter, it's too late for an outreach program to be 
launched with any realistic hope of significant success for this year's election. 
Burnett says he's looking more to 1998.</p>
<p>Looking back, meanwhile, one finds the standout example of former 
Knoxvillian Charles E. ``Pete'' Drew, who as a black state legislator 
switched from Democrat to Republican back in 1985 and later quit his job 
at Rohm and Haas to head a formal GOP outreach program.</p>
<p>Drew won re-election in 1986 after his switch. That same year, Republican 
Winfield Dunn lost the governor's race to Democrat Ned McWherter. After 
Dunn went down, so did Drew and the GOP's minority involvement 
program that he was hired to head. In 1988, Democratic state Rep. Joe 
Armstrong defeated Drew 55-45 percent.</p>
<p>Over at state party headquarters, meanwhile, he recalls that the outreach 
program became ``a really stressful kind of situation'' and the source of some 
divisiveness as state party leadership changed with the end of Gov. Lamar 
Alexander's term and exit of Jim Henry as state GOP chair.</p>
<p>In allocating party resources, the party pulled the plug on its outreach 
program -- along with such dreams as uniting Republican state legislators 
with black state legislators in a coalition.</p>
<p>Drew subsequently did a stint as a lobbyist for anti-abortion activists at the 
Legislature and moved to Chattanooga, where he runs a Methodist church 
youth program and manages a food cooperative for low-income families.</p>
<p>He's running for the Legislature again this year as the GOP nominee against 
black Democratic Rep. Tommie Brown of Chattanooga. </p>
<p>Drew says he's short on campaign money, though, and has a problem getting 
some big-name GOP contributors to return his calls. (His zeal in the pro-life 
cause and tilt toward the religious right have always caused consternation in 
some quarters.)</p>
<p>The timing may be better nowadays for a Republican outreach program, he 
says, if the party were to put money and effort into it.</p>
<p>Black attitudes on some issues -- welfare reform, as exemplified by last 
week's bill signing by President Clinton -- may be changing to a point less 
divergent from traditional Republican approaches. Democrats already have 
an outreach program, both at the state and national levels, as well as a 
tradition that the GOP must overcome.</p>
<p>Democrats have people such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a man with a 
history of championing black causes that dates to civil rights crusade days, 
as a party promoter. Republicans have had no black of any appreciable 
national stature until Powell's recent appearance on the scene.</p>
<p>At the state level, the GOP preaches about the party having a Big Tent 
where everybody is welcome -- but the audience that hears the preaching is 
pretty much all white.</p>
<p>There would appear to be some chance for at least incremental GOP gains 
in minority vote-gathering. Folks like Gov. Don Sundquist have probably 
helped set the stage by appointing blacks to prominent cabinet positions.</p>
<p>But, as the Drew disaster of a decade ago indicates, any such project would 
have to be a long-term, costly effort. And it's pretty debatable whether the 
party would go beyond lip service to such a commitment. Maybe next 
decade?</p>

CONVENTIONS </h2>
<p><em>By Tom Humphrey, News-Sentinel Nashville bureau</em></p>
<p>As a general proposition, I must confess a personal susceptibility to affliction 
with the grass-is-always-greener syndrome when dealing with partisan 
politicians.</p>
<p>In other words, the more time spent hanging around with Republicans, as in 
a couple of weeks ago in San Diego, the better Democrats start looking. 
Conversely, the more time spent with Democrats, as in the week just past in 
Chicago, the better those Republicans start looking.</p>
<p>Having acknowledged this tendency (perhaps merely a surly disposition) and 
attempting to compensate for it in hindsight, the following observations are 
offered in comparing the two parties in their convention camps:</p>
<p>* In the we're-the-nicest-bunch-of-guys competition, the Democrats won. 
President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore Jr. both said really 
wonderful things about Bob Dole, for example, before trashing him in their 
convention speeches. Gore even refrained from trotting out a pre-convention 
favorite line about the ``two-headed Dole-Gingrich monster.'' </p>
<p>Dole and Jack Kemp, on the other hand, didn't use the words ``decent man'' 
is ``entitled to our respect'' in reference to Clinton or Gore, delivering their 
trashing remarks without such a soft-soap prelude, indicating they are 
meaner -- and way behind in the polls.</p>
<p>The tendency filtered down to the state delegation level, where both parties 
sent daily talking points from professional message-meisters for use in 
presenting a uniform image. In the Tennessee delegations, Republicans tried 
a bit harder at putting on the happy face -- and perhaps succeeded a bit 
more -- but had that offset by more orchestrated growling at the opposition.</p>
<p>* In fringe folk crowd control, the nod again has to go to the Democrats. 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a problem from the left for mainstream-seeking 
Democrats in the past, was brought aboard to deliver a key convention 
speech. Pat Buchanan, a problem from the right for mainstream-seeking 
Republicans, was muzzled this time insofar as convention speaking goes and 
was considerably less enthusiastic about offering his backing to the party 
nominee than was Jackson.</p>
<p>Among Tennesseans, there were tensions within the ranks of both the 
Democratic and Republican delegations, but in both cases the dissenters 
kept publicly quiet for the most part.</p>
<p>* In hero worship, the Republicans had an edge on the national nominee 
homage with fawning praise of Bob Dole, via video presentation and 
speeches, more amazing than the fawning praise of Bill Clinton. </p>
<p>Amongst Tennessee delegations, on the other hand, the reverence, awe, 
foot-kissing and general good-hearted gush directed toward Al Gore Jr. 
surpassed the combined bombardment of GOP gush directed toward the 
entire assemblage of such heroic figures as the retiring Jimmy Quillen and the 
losing Lamar Alexander. </p>
<p>* On the long-windedness front, Clinton spoke for 66minutes in his keynote 
address, Dole for 57minutes. Democrats had more speakers on the 
convention podium. The same rules held true at Tennessee delegation 
meetings, where Democratic meetings ran longer with more speakers.</p>
<p>* The diversity-inclusiveness award, of course, goes to Democrats despite 
valiant and showy efforts by Republicans to obscure this by putting women 
and minority members on center stage at every opportunity. The Democratic 
delegation -- both as a whole and in Tennessee -- had more women, more 
minorities and more folks in about any category you wanted to create except 
wealthy white males (and there were a respectable number of those).</p>
<p>Gays and lesbians, for example, were mostly left to demonstrate outside the 
GOP convention, though there were a few Log Cabin Club types around. At 
the Democratic digs, they had a 100-plus caucus of delegates inside with 
heavy-duty speakers -- including Tipper Gore -- rhetorically demonstrating 
to them.</p>
<p>* In schmoozing with corporate special interests, the two groups were 
virtually identical as each used big donations. Various figures thrown around 
in the convention towns indicate both sides sucked up about $12million in 
corporate largess for the conventions. Unions, of course, far prefer the 
Democrats.</p>
<p>* In partying, the two sides were also pretty well matched -- though the 
Democrats may have shown a somewhat higher energy level, what with 
Gore dancing the macarena and all.</p>

<HEAD><TITLE>NOT ALL SHARE IN ADORATION OF AL GORE</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><A HREF="/"><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="A Publication of News-Sentinel Online" BORDER=0></A><center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>September  8, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>NOT ALL SHARE IN ADORATION OF AL GORE</H2>

Unabashed Al adoration, also known as Gore gush, has afflicted most Tennessee Democrats for better than a decade now, and it reached a fever pitch among the home state crowd gathered in Chicago a couple of weeks ago.<P>

    Even within the ranks of the faithful at the Democratic National Convention, however, there were murmurs of dissent to the public praise heaped upon the shoulders of Vice President Albert Gore Jr., heir apparent to the party's presidential nomination in 2000.<P>

    So far, it's nothing like the bold bashing that the state's other presidential wannabe -- Republican Lamar Alexander -- has suffered from that minority of Tennesseans within his party unbitten by the love-Lamar bug.<P>

    Lamar, of course, presently holds no power of office to intimidate critics -- such as the Tennessee folks who journeyed to New Hampshire in an attempt to undercut his presidential campaign early this year.<P>

    Al, on the other hand, is No. 2 man in the nation insofar as power and prestige go right now. Definitely not the man for a Tennessee Democrat to monkey with in public. And most Democratic activists in the state do indeed seem to have nothing but the warmest and fuzziest of Al adoration symptoms.<P>

    That said, however, there are some Democratic dissenters in the praise of Prince Albert.<P>

    There is, of course, some natural and inevitable distancing of a Washington-bound officeholder with multiple duties from the folks back home. Tennesseans had seen relatively little of him until re-election year rolled around, and Tennessee was established as a battleground state.<P>

    (And one that could embarrass him -- possibly dampening his presidential prospects -- should it go GOP in the fall.)<P>

    This physical distancing has been accompanied by issue distancing, best exemplified by Gore's newfound anti-tobacco activism.<P>

    State Democrats running for office, at least those from tobacco-growing areas, have publicly criticized the new restrictions that President Clinton -- urged on by Gore -- has placed on cigarette advertising and sales.<P>

    Examples range from U.S. Reps. Bart Gordon and Bob Clement to state Rep. Ken Givens, D-Rogersville, a tobacco farmer and chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.<P>

    While the public distancing from that presidential policy has been coupled with proper pronouncements of respect, the private talk includes some contentions that Gore is opportunistically exploiting an issue to the detriment of some Democrats back home. (Others, of course, laud the move.)<P>

    One frequent inhabitant of smoke-filled Democratic rooms, questioned by a reporter about a vice presidential speech to the convention, provided first a typical outpouring of Gore gush. Then he paused and added:<P>

    ``Off the record? I didn't think much of it. Actually, the words `contrived' and (expletive deleted) came to mind.''<P>

    The speech in question was the Gore address in which he recalled his sister's 1984 death from lung cancer and vowed that ``until my last breath, I will pour my heart and soul into the cause of protecting our children from the dangers of smoking.''<P>

    In 1984, of course, Gore was also running for the U.S. Senate -- against Republican Victor Ashe, now mayor of Knoxville -- and openly soliciting the votes and support of tobacco farmers with pledges to watch out for their interests. <P>

    (The campaign was also notable for Gore's refusal to mention the name of former Vice President Walter Mondale, then the Democratic presidential nominee, even when Ashe offered during a debate to donate $5 to Gore's favorite charity if he would do so. Some Democrats say he has otherwise occasionally been less than loyal to some party causes and candidates since then.)<P>

    In 1988, he was running for president and openly soliciting the support of tobacco farmers -- in fact, boasting about his personal tobacco crop care in a North Carolina speech.<P>

    Gore has collected about $14,000 in campaign contributions from tobacco interest groups during various office seeking efforts. And, as recently as two years ago, his family farm in Smith County had tobacco crops as a mainstay. <P>

    In short, the argument can be made that the political pursuit of glory for Gore has involved some blowing of smoke and general hypocrisy. Republicans are certainly making that argument. And that leaves some Democrats to puff and fume.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>NEW STATE SUN LOGO SHINES IN TENNESSEE</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><a href="/"><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="A Knoxville News-Sentinel Online product" border=0></a></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>September 15, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>NEW STATE SUN LOGO SHINES IN TENNESSEE</H2>

When the governor-with-sun-in-his-name unveiled a sunny new state symbol and slogan at the State Museum last week, perhaps the most dramatic moment came in the showing of a sunrise video.<P>

    On the big screen mounted on a museum wall, there appeared to the quiet, almost worshipful audience (mostly ranking state government bureaucrats) and a starry night sky.<P>

    The silence was broken by a crowing rooster, followed by the sound of a babbling brook, then kids playing, then a guitar playing, then birds singing. And so on, one sound at a time, until . . . behold! The sun rose as part of the new state logo.<P>

    The applause was warm. The governor-with-the-sun-in-his-name beamed.<P>

    Yes, ancient Egypt had its sun god, Ra. Historic France had its sun king, Louis XIV. Japan has its rising sun flag.<P>

    And now, Tennessee has its own sunny symbol, or hallmark as it is formally designated. A very bright governor has presented it to us.<P>

    If you haven't seen the symbol, created by a Memphis PR firm for $19,000, you soon will.<P>

    Plans call for plastering it on state vehicles, state road signs, license plates and the like over the next couple of years. (No one professed knowledge of how much that will cost, but ``minimal'' seemed to be the operative word.) It shows a map of Tennessee, green, with a golden sun rising above it. Beneath is written the new slogan: ``TennesSee. Sounds good to me.''<P>

    Actually, this sidekick to the hallmark is formally designated as the state theme line. We already had an official state slogan. Adopted in 1965, ``Tennessee: America at its best'' is apparently being eased off to the sidelines -- though not officially replaced.<P>

    There's also a state seal that has been around since 1801, a pretty bland thing with no bright colors at all. And we have a state motto, which was not officially adopted until 1987 though it's imprinted on the state seal. The motto is ``Agriculture and Commerce.'' Yawn.<P>

    So, to the question of whether we really need a colorful new state hallmark and a nifty theme line, let it be answered: Virginia may be for lovers, but Tennessee sounds good to me.<P>

    You might recall that Gov. Don Sundquist's campaign logo also has a sun upon it. On that creation, the golden orb centers on the `Quist' portion of his name, with the `Sun' portion set out in blue letters by itself.<P>

    The governor offered assurances that he had nothing to do with the symbol selection, though he praised it at length. His political logo, he explained, dates way back to his 1982 congressional campaign and is ``patterned after SunKist,'' the company of citrus fruit fame.<P>

    And it is surely coincidental, of course, that the sun symbols will be rising statewide before the Sunquist re-election campaign in 1998.<P>

    After all, sun worship has been a part of Tennessee politics for a long time, despite the evening-evoking image of three stars on our state flag. <P>

    For example, former Democratic Gov. Ray Blanton used the phrase ``Ray of Blanton Sunshine'' in his 1974 campaign. His successor, Republican Lamar Alexander, later characterized the Blanton era as a time of darkness and trumpted his own reign as ushering in ``rising, shining Tennessee'' -- the title of a story on the state in National Geographic magazine a decade or so ago.<P>

    So it is only fitting that the governor with sun in his name should expand upon the sunshine shown in the past rather than simply bask in the fading glow.<P>

    And if his political picture is brightened in the process, well, so be it. Perhaps the next logical step could be putting a new sun twist to his name come campaign time.<P>

    The name Sundquist could be subjected to such distortions as Sunsquirt, Sunsquash, Sunsquish, Sunsquat or Sunsquabble. These, obviously, could be considered inappropriately unflattering for a campaign theme line when run through the PR firm folks.<P>

    At the other extreme -- too flattering or too pompous -- would be labels such as Sun King or Sun God.<P>

    Sun Governor has a nice ring to it. Or, for short, maybe just the Sun Gov. That would fit neatly onto a bumper sticker, as in ``Re-elect the Sun Gov'' -- overlaid on a golden orb, of course.<P>

    Sounds good to me. Especially if someone will send along a check for $19,000.<P>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>C</font>oattails are not what they used to be in Tennessee, but candidates -- 
especially the sinking sort -- are quick to grab for the patchy remnants when 
they come into view. </p>
<p>The statewide Democratic and Republican party organizations, meanwhile, 
are diligently trying to weave together the patches into some sort of partisan 
pattern. </p>
<p>The results to date seem pretty tattered, if not torn. A month before early 
voting begins, Tennesseans seem poised to return to their ticket-splitting 
ways. </p>
<p>Starting at the top of the ticket, conventional political wisdom has come to 
regard Bob Dole as a big loser in the national presidential picture. </p>
<p>Polls indicate he's not floundering as badly in Tennessee as in most of the 
nation (trailing by only 11points in one recent survey), giving the GOP some 
hope of salvaging the state situation. Maybe even one of those miracles that 
the evangelical Pat Robertson talked about recently. </p>
<p>But quiet whispers in GOP circles are to the effect that the presidential 
emperor just may have no clothes in Tennessee, much less coattails. </p>
<p>Instead, Republicans in search of coattails look to Sen. Fred Thompson, 
widely perceived as wrapped in a cloak of invulnerability so strong that it will 
be unfrayed by the unkindest of Democratic cuts. </p>
<p>And just maybe, the GOP wishful thinking goes, the Thompson tails can be 
grasped by other candidates -- at least indirectly, in that his presence on the 
ballot will inspire otherwise uninspired party faithful to got to the polls. </p>
<p>On the flip side, Democrats seem to deem Vice President Al Gore Jr. as 
possessor of the most fashionable coat available for touching in Tennessee. 
It certainly looks better than President Clinton's clothing, which is so likened 
to camouflage in some circles that the president himself grasps for Gore in 
the veep's home state. </p>
<p>And Prince Albert, who in campaigns past put considerable distance 
between himself and certain other Democrats, is quite gracious this year in 
granting a grip on the hem of his garment as he looks to a run for the party's 
presidential nomination in 2000. </p>
<p>Houston Gordon, the Democrat facing Thompson, was able last week to 
count eight occasions that he has stood on a platform to be blessed by Gore. </p>
<p>Gore helped raise around $50,000 last week for Mark Stewart, the 
Democratic nominee in the 4th congressional District that Gore once 
represented himself. </p>
<p>He has verbally blessed other Democratic congressional candidates in 
varying degrees (perhaps the least blessed to date are the two extreme 
underdog Smiths of East Tennessee -- Kay of the 1st District and Steve of 
the 2nd) and said nice things about candidates down to the state legislator 
level. </p>
<p>Of course, it's possible that Gore can get a bit of a boost himself from other 
candidates -- and not just in 2000. Gordon, for example, may do very well 
over in his West Tennessee home turf and just might inspire a few folks at 
the polls to vote for Clinton-Gore in a region that just might decide the 
presidential election in the state. </p>
<p>Coattail-clinging and back-scratching are not incompatible phenomena. </p>
<p>All that said, however, darn few Tennesseans are likely to cast their vote for 
one candidate because they like another candidate. For the most part, it's a 
case of every candidate for himself or herself. </p>
<p>The two major parties, on a broader basis, seek some candidate linkage in 
their strategic endeavors. But this is mostly reverse coattails -- a matter of 
trying to toss a vat of dye in horrid hues upon the clothing of the other party's 
people in general. </p>
<p>Thus, Democrats seek to paint every Republican with Newt Gingrich 
gruesome green while Republicans try to color every Democrat with a Ted 
Kennedy canvas or maybe Bill Clinton's blues. </p>
<p>Of course, each party and most individual candidates try to dodge the dye 
cast by the opposing party and that, in turn, taints the credibility of their own 
coloring schemes. </p>
<p>There's enough partisan spray paint around so that some probably sticks to 
a surface here and there, but suspicions are that most of the 
independent-minded voters who decide elections see through it all. </p>
<p>Ticket-splitting Tennesseans do not view a Democratic president and 
Republican Congress as a clashing of colors but as a blend of hues nicely 
contrasting -- presenting a Jacob's coat of many colors. With no tails. </p>

<p><!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Dateline Here--><br>
<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>A</font>rash of recent partisan rhetoric to the contrary, there are some 
suggestions that it doesn't matter whether Republicans or Democrats have 
more members in the state's most exclusive political club. </p>
<p>That's the state Senate, of course, where membership is limited to 33 
persons. Dues are pretty steep, with individuals known to pay more than 
$400,000 in campaign expenditures to secure one of the club seats. </p>
<p>Presiding over the club for the past 26 years has been 75-year-old Lt. Gov. 
John Wilder, who is fond of referring to the assemblage as ''family.'' </p>
<p>As patriarch, he has been happy to help family members with their dues this 
election year. And if money talks, what's said in Wilder's financial 
disclosures could be translated as declaring partisan or philosophical 
affiliations are unimportant. </p>
<p>For starters, the disclosure shows Wilder has recently made campaign 
contributions to each of the 12 incumbent senators up for re-election. </p>
<p>Equalized distributions at $1,000 a pop have gone, for example, to Senate 
Republican Leader Ben Atchley of Knoxville and Senate Democratic 
Leader Ward Crutchfield of Chattanooga. </p>
<p>Similarly, Sen. Steve Cohen, a Memphis Democrat who is arguably the 
Senate's most liberal member, is treated by Wilder as the family financial 
equal to Sen. Carl Koella, a Townsend Republican who is arguably the 
Senate's most conservative member. </p>
<p>And so on. </p>
<p>Asked why this was so last week, Wilder said: ''Because the Senate is family 
and they are part of the family, I gave to all of them.'' </p>
<p>With one curious exception, no contributions went to any nonincumbent 
Senate candidate -- though Wilder has not ruled out that possibility for the 
weeks ahead. </p>
<p>The exception was $250 to state Rep. Roy Herron, D-Dresden, now 
running for the state Senate with Sundquist rhetorically denouncing him at 
every turn. (Herron is a ''criminal-coddling liberal,'' says the governor.) </p>
<p>Asked about this, Wilder explained that Herron had given him $250 last 
year and ''he didn't need to do that when he was running his own race.'' </p>
<p>The pot of money from which these funds were distributed was collected on 
a similarly bipartisan or bi-philosophical basis. When Wilder opened the 
gates last year, practically everybody who is anybody in state government 
circles rushed to make offerings. </p>
<p>Republican Gov. Don Sundquist held a fund-raiser for Wilder while former 
Democratic Gov. Ned McWherter chipped in. So did Nashville Mayor Phil 
Bredesen, who ran against Sundquist in 1994. </p>
<p>The president of the Tennessee Association of Business coughed up some 
coins; so did TAB's sometimes arch-enemy at the Legislature, the AFL-CIO 
Labor Council. Doctors and lawyers, equally at odds in the lobbying arena, 
were united in giving to Wilder. </p>
<p>A letter in Wilder's file from Ted Welch, national fund-raiser for Republicans 
ranging from Lamar Alexander to Bob Dole, recounts how he solicited and 
accepted, on Wilder's behalf, two $10,000 contributions on Dec. 20, 1995 
-- 11 days before the effective date of a new law limiting the size of 
campaign donations. The Senate Democratic Caucus gave $2,000. </p>
<p>Atchley has vowed to personally nominate Wilder for another term as 
speaker and lieutenant governor if Republicans have a majority next year. </p>
<p>Against this backdrop, it was somewhat surprising to see Wilder more or 
less criticized by a Republican senatorial wannabe last week. </p>
<p>State Rep. Mike Williams, R-Maynardville, issued a news release 
denouncing his incumbent opponent, Democratic Sen. Danny Wallace of 
Maynardville, for ''hauling in outsiders'' to campaign on Wallace's behalf. </p>
<p>Though avoiding use of Wilder's name, there's no doubt euphemisms such as 
''Danny's Democratic friends in the state Senate'' and ''state Senate buddies 
from outside our district'' referred to Wilder, who campaigned with Wallace 
through the district recently. (Of course, Wilder campaigns for Republicans 
in their districts, too.) </p>
<p>So, if Williams should upset Wallace and get elected, will Williams be cast in 
the role of outsider among the Senate insiders? Not a chance, if history is 
any indication. A Republican example is Sen. Tom Leatherwood, 
R-Millington, who defeated a Wilder-supported incumbent to become a 
Wilder-supported incumbent. </p>
<p>All of this, of course, proves that it does matter which party has the most 
Senate members. After all, such honors and ceremony is what club 
membership is all about. </p>

<p><!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Dateline Here--><br>
<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>T</font>he topic of integrity was transformed into something of a mudslinging 
political sideshow by our state's two top partisan performers one day last 
week, but there just might be some hope for salvaging the situation. </p>
<p>State Republican Chairman Jim Burnett stepped on stage first, calling a news 
conference to sign an integrity pledge and urging Democratic Chairman Will 
Cheek to do the same. The idea of integrity in politics, while somewhat 
novel, is naturally something that most everybody would support. </p>
<p>Of course, Burnett in proposing the pledge -- and even in the pledge 
verbiage itself -- devoted himself to bashing those nasty darn Democrats for 
their evil campaigning ways. </p>
<p>The word ''integrity'' was thus deployed as a mudslinging weapon, a curious 
twist in the connotation normally applied to integrity outside the political 
arena. </p>
<p>Cheek, a political arena combatant, recognized this for the attack it was and 
responded in kind -- bashing those nasty darn Republicans for all their evil 
campaigning ways. </p>
<p>If our political parties were serious about an integrity pledge, they would sit 
down and negotiate the terms -- not summon poor media wretches, 
ink-stained and otherwise, to witness a mud-flinging fest. (Burnett, it may be 
noted, did not inform Cheek of his sign-the-pledge challenge until after he 
had finished bashing Democrats. Cheek apparently never communicated his 
no or anything else back to Burnett, except through us second-hand folks.) </p>
<p>But, to give things a curious twist, perhaps it is in order to propose some 
terms that the two sides could agree upon. Actually, Burnett's preamble to 
the pledge isn't that bad a starting point. A sample sentence: </p>
<p>''We pledge that we will follow the letter and spirit of the law and uphold the 
highest ethical standards of fairness and integrity in all campaign activities 
including financial transactions and in representing the records and positions 
of candidates of either party.'' </p>
<p>Who could argue with that? I suspect both Cheek and Burnett (two basically 
decent fellows, by the way) would rhetorically endorse the concept. Both 
would be nervous, however, signing on to that spirit stuff and 
highest-ethical-standards business without some clarification. </p>
<p>Burnett provided the GOP clarification in his proposal, which goes on to 
say, in essence, ''We promise not to do all the dirty things that we say the 
Democrats are doing to us.'' </p>
<p>There are six sections to the pledge. For example, one is a promise ''to be 
truthful and accurate in all communications regarding the positions and 
record of candidates of either party.'' </p>
<p>In explaining this, Burnett declared that the timeworn practice of wild 
exaggeration would still be permissible. If this were spelled out in an 
amendment to the language, Cheek might go along. </p>
<p>Thus, a challenger to an incumbent legislator (to use an example originally 
deployed by Republicans but since seized by Democrats as well), could 
count up all the times that the incumbent voted to let the Board of Boiler 
Inspectors and its kin charge an extra 25cents for an inspection to avoid 
taking any money out of the state's overall revenue fund. </p>
<p>The challenger can then run an ad denouncing the incumbent as a 
''tax-and-spend liberal'' who has voted for ''167 tax increases.'' </p>
<p>Bills authorizing a county commission to impose such things as a 1percent 
sales tax on tourists stopping at a motel, funding some much desired local 
project, are also included in such tax-and-spend-liberal lists. </p>
<p>Realistically, then, the language should be something like: ''We promise to 
have at least some remote, arguably defensible, claim to a semblance of 
accuracy in communicating records of an opponent.'' </p>
<p>Maybe one of those ''provided however'' clauses that have a way of 
appearing in bills enacted by the Legislature would take care of everything. 
After each grandiose statement pledging to avoid the untruthful and 
inaccurate, then, there would appear a sentence declaring: </p>
<p>''Provided, however, that wild exaggerations, distortions, oversimplifications 
and outrageous innuendoes are permissible at all times, especially when no 
accurate, explainable facts are available for convenient use in 30-second 
sound bites to persuade voters that the other guy is a complete and utter 
jerk.'' </p>
<p>That should pass muster for integrity in both partisan camps these days. 
Agreed? </p>

        <p><font size="2"><i><!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Dateline Here--></i></font><br>
        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">I</font>t appears that the election next
        month is shaping up to provide easy decisions -- at least
        in most races -- for those of us who prefer to vote for losers. </p>
        <p>That has always been my personal preference for an
        array of reasons, though I've suffered a good bit of
        ridicule from folks who berate the idea of wasting a vote
        and delight in proclaiming they voted for a winner. Polls indicate
        such folks are in the majority, which is why candidates
        -- almost without exception -- like to declare that
        momentum is with them, and victory is at hand. </p>
        <p>It is submitted, however, that underdogs are the
        candidates who keep the democratic process alive in this
        day and age and, therefore, are entitled to encouragement
        -- so long as they are not complete ding bats. </p>
        <p>Further, it's healthy for a victor to keep in mind
        that some folks voted against him or her. Such an
        awareness may hold down the arrogance level of
        officeholders. </p>
        <p>And there's the loser-lover's satisfaction in being
        able to declare (at least to oneself) ''it's not my
        fault'' when the officeholder fouls up at some point down
        the road. </p>
        <p>Finally, since I have no particular partisan
        affiliation, the choice of a loser makes vote-casting
        easy -- a sort of parallel to those yellow dog Democrats
        or rock-ribbed Republicans who don't have to bother
        thinking about the merits of individual candidates in a
        general election. </p>
        <p>Close races are a source of much discomfort for us
        loser-lovers. Then, we are obliged to conscientiously
        evaluate the individuals, the issues, the images and make
        a tough decision -- knowing that the vote could actually
        impact the outcome. Such responsibility creates a
        downright discomforting dilemma. </p>
        <p>So, it is with considerable relief that the big ticket
        races seem to be settling into a clear winner-loser
        pattern as election day draws close. In the interest of
        being open and candid, then, here's the way Tennessee
        loser lineup looks right now (subject, of course, to
        change should something dramatic occur): </p>
        <p>* In the presidential race, Republican Bob Dole is
        pretty much established himself as the loser favorite
        here in Tennessee, though there's at least a remote
        possibility that Democrats Bill Clinton and Al Gore could
        stumble enough in the late going to deserve my vote. </p>
        <p>* In the U.S. Senate race, the Democrat with two last
        names, Houston Gordon, is shaping up as the overwhelming
        favorite of loser-lovers. He's the sort of candidate we
        can really get behind -- a decent man who is articulate, intelligent
        and absolutely certain to be creamed at the polls. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, his foe, fabulous Fred Thompson, is
        a man in danger of becoming the subject of GOP cult
        worship. Indeed, if speculation about him running for
        president in 2000 is true, Lamar Alexander might well
        become the loser favorite in the GOP presidential
        primary. </p>
        <p>* In the U.S. House races, loser-choosers have some
        cause for discomfort in Districts 3, 4, 6 and 7.
        Elsewhere, the choices are clear. In those four races,
        the anti-incumbents may be the safest choice for those in
        search of a loser -- but there remains a possibility that
        head-scratching and pondering time could be at hand. </p>
        <p>* State legislative races remain a source of
        considerable annoyance in several districts for voters in
        search of a sure loser. Not so in Knox County, of course,
        where the anti-incumbent vote will be on the losing side
        in all likelihood. </p>
        <p>I have a hunch at this point that on a statewide basis
        loser-lovers might want to tilt toward the Republican
        candidates. As a group, they just might lose ground in
        the Legislature. </p>
        <p>In individual districts, however, you'll just have to
        look for losers where you can find them. Hint: Go for the
        candidate you never heard of before. He or she probably
        didn't have much campaign money and, therefore, is going
        to lose. </p>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>O</font>dds and ends on state government doings while the fall campaigns get 
most of the attention: </p>
<p>Odd: State tax collections continue to run below the levels anticipated when 
the state's $14billion budget for the 1996-97 fiscal year was set five months 
ago, at which time Gov. Don Sundquist and legislative leaders joined in 
praise of its frugality while approving an ample serving of election-year 
pork-barrel projects. More recently, the University of Tennessee, to cite one 
example, has told administrators to figure ways to cut 3percent out of its 
current spending -- just as a precaution, of course. </p>
<p>End: We'll have to wait until the election has passed. But it's possible that the 
state's rainy-day fund, $100million or so, is headed down the drain with 
other repercussions that will make the 1997 legislative session a lot less fun 
than '96. </p>
<p>Odd: The two Republican members of the Tennessee Regulatory Authority, 
which replaced the scandal-ridden Public Service Commission in regulating 
the telecommunications industry on July 1, are reportedly unhappy that the 
Democratic member, Sara Kyle, is avoiding her Nashville office. Kyle, 44, is 
pregnant, lives in Memphis and has a husband (state Sen. Jim Kyle) who is 
running for re-election. Seems her decision to attend a couple of meetings of 
the TRA via telephone conference call was not properly communicated -- or 
''telecommunicated'' -- far enough in advance, and the sessions had to be 
postponed until proper legal notice was given. This occurred after Kyle 
dissented from what some perceived as attempts to keep some TRA 
sessions secret, perhaps violating the state's Open Meetings Act. </p>
<p>End: Uncertain, but a suggestion is in order: The TRA, once memorably 
labeled TRA-LA-LA (yes, pronounced tra-la-la, as in a song) by an 
industry lobbyist who had just listened to a rather babbling rhetorical ramble 
by Kyle, should just openly schedule all its meetings by telecommunications 
means as a matter of routine. Republicans Lynn Greer and Melvin Malone, 
not to mention Kyle herself, would probably be happier with her in 
Memphis. </p>
<p>Odd: The Special Supreme Court of Tennessee, also known as the 
Keystone Kourt or the Five Stooges, which produced an out-of-left-field 
October expansion of its July journey into what the Specials themselves 
labeled in a formal opinion ''something approaching legal chaos.'' The 
October expansion came by answering a question no one asked, apparently 
because the Specials heard an upstart attorney general's opinion in 
September that they didn't like. Attorney General Charles Burson had said 
both East and West Tennesseans were eligible to fill the regular Supreme 
Court seat held by voter-exiled Justice Penny White. The Specials said, no, 
only East Tennesseans could apply. </p>
<p>Of course, White was ousted by an August yes-no referendum that the 
Specials said could not occur -- until a federal judge said, yes, it could. And 
the Special Supremes' October pronouncement has been declared invalid by 
an unsupreme and unspecial chancellor (appointed by Gov. Don Sundquist, 
who appointed the Specials themselves only once). </p>
<p>End: Something approaching legal chaos. Four regular Supremes, whose 
decision to recuse themselves from resolving the original legal dispute led to 
Sundquist's appointment of the Specials, have decided to try resolving the 
latest special edict. Regardless of the regular Supremes' decision, Sundquist 
had best appoint an East Tennessean to fill White's seat or face the prospect 
of some criminal -- after having a conviction upheld by a 3-2 vote -- file 
another lawsuit dragging up the whole mess and questioning the validity of 
Supreme seating. Then again, that could allow him to appoint another batch 
of Specials to hear the challenge. </p>
<p>Odd: The regular Supremes, 10 weeks or so after White's ouster amid 
criticism that she had an anti-death penalty orientation, have instructed their 
public relations person to issue press releases on capital punishment actions. </p>
<p>End: Spokeswoman Sue Allison says it's just a Supreme recognition that 
folks are interested in what's happening on death penalty appeals. Of course, 
the regular Supremes are up for re-election in two years (the most 
conservative of them, Justice Frank Drowota, is reportedly in line for a 
federal bench appointment if President Clinton is re-elected), and voter 
enlightenment might not hurt their chances. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">D</font>r. Polly Sigh, professor of
        conventional wisdom in the University of Maynardville's
        Department of Political Seance, finally unveiled the 1996 Projections
        and Expectations Report in Tennessee last week. </p>
        <p>Presented at a meeting of a conventional wisdom think
        tank, the projections portion offers considerable comfort
        to incumbents since the status quo is projected to
        prevail. The expectations portion is another matter. </p>
        <p>(The think tank is called Governmental Information
        Banter Babble Educator Institute for Scholarly Hindsight,
        or GIBBERISH. Dr. Sigh is also director of GIBBERISH.) </p>
        <p>With the election almost at hand, a final rundown on
        such conventional wisdom seems in order. Here it is: </p>
        <p>* In the presidential race, the nation's no. 1
        incumbent, Bill Clinton, is projected to win both
        Tennessee and the nation comfortably. The expectation,
        however, is that the Tennessee victory over Bob Dole will
        be bigger than the nation as a whole. </p>
        <p>''If not, Al Gore's embarrassment in his home state
        will be great, and his prospects for winning the
        Democratic presidential nomination in 2000 will be
        devastated,'' says Polly, sighing. ''On the other hand,
        if Gore's home state crowd gives his ticket just
        5percentage points more than the national percentage, he
        will be unbeatable in the 2000 primaries.'' </p>
        <p>* In the U.S. Senate race, incumbent Republican Sen.
        Fred Thompson is projected to win comfortably. The
        expectation is that his margin of triumph over Democrat
        Houston Gordon will be as great as in 1994's win over Democrat
        Jim Cooper (about 60percent to 40percent). </p>
        <p>''If not, Thompson will be humiliated, and his hopes
        of winning the Republican presidential nomination in 2000
        will be devastated,'' Polly sighed. ''That, of course,
        would be good for Lamar Alexander.'' </p>
        <p>''On the other hand, if what's-his-name -- oh, yeah,
        Gordon Houston -- betters Cooper's performance
        substantially, say with 45percent, he will become a hot
        Democratic commodity for the 1998 market, maybe as governor. </p>
        <p>''If Gordon falls below Cooper's performance, his
        hopes of winning anything ever again -- perhaps even
        employment as lawyer for Jimmy Naifeh or Ned McWherter --
        will be devastated.'' </p>
        <p>* In the U.S. House races, incumbents are projected to
        win everywhere they're campaigning in Tennessee
        (including the 9th District, where Rep. Harold Ford Sr.
        is campaigning for his son, Harold Ford Jr.) and by comfortable
        margins everywhere except in two cases -- Republican Rep. Van
        Hilleary of the 4th District and Democratic Rep. Bart
        Gordon of the 6th. </p>
        <p>Expectations vary. The highest expectation --
        70percent -- is set for 2nd District Republican Rep.
        Jimmy Duncan. </p>
        <p>''If he falls short, someone will actually raise an
        eyebrow,'' Sigh says. ''And Steve Smith (his Democratic
        foe) would be established as a formidable contender for
        something, maybe state legislator.'' </p>
        <p>The expectation for 1st District GOP nominee Bill
        Jenkins is that he must get 65percent to lessen the
        chances of a formidable primary challenge in two years. </p>
        <p>''However, expectations are that he'll be accused of
        fouling something up in his first term so that he gets a
        primary challenger anyway,'' she says. </p>
        <p>To meet expectations, 3rd District Republican Rep.
        Zach Wamp must match Thompson's percentage figures or,
        Sigh says, his chances of winning the nomination for
        Thompson's Senate seat (should Thompson be elected president
        in 2000) will be devastated. </p>
        <p>Hilleary, on the other hand, can achieve shoo-in
        status for a Senate nomination with just 55percent of the
        vote. Ditto for Bart Gordon on the Democratic side. (The
        political careers of Hilleary's challenger, Mark Stewart,
        and Gordon's foe, Steve Gill, will be permanently
        devastated if they get less than 49percent.) </p>
        <p>* In state legislative races, Democrats are projected
        to regain a majority in state Senate seats (restoring the
        status quo upset by a couple of post-election desertions
        to the GOP in 1995). Democrats are also projected to
        retain a lopsided majority in the House. </p>
        <p>''Here, much higher expectations have been set by Gov.
        Don Sundquist and the Republican Party, who have been
        quite aggressive in attacking a number of Democrats
        likely to win,'' according to the GIBBERISH director. </p>
        <p>''At the same time, the governor has refused to
        criticize most incumbent Democrats -- so he can be blamed
        for the setback by Republicans. The upshot is that the
        governor gets the worst of both worlds -- a Legislature dominated
        by angry Democrats and blame from angry Republicans. His prospects
        for re-election in 1998 will be devastated.'' </p>
        <p>And that, Polly sighed, is enough conventional wisdom
        GIBBERISH for one campaign season. </p>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->        <font size="5">I</font>n the election aftermath, House
        Speaker Jimmy Naifeh and Gov. Don Sundquist displayed
        different symptoms in their sufferings from a malady that
        has reached epidemic proportions in the Tennessee body
        politic. </p>
        <p>Democrat Naifeh said it makes him mad. Republican
        Sundquist said it makes him ''almost physically ill.''
        Other symptoms frequently encountered are whining,
        growling and -- in extreme cases -- fits of screaming or
        tears. </p>
        <p>All are predictable reactions to the old mud-slinging
        virus (MSV), which has made politicians and voters ill
        for a long time. At least in Tennessee, however, the
        stuff has only in recent years become institutionalized, organized
        and factory-produced for mass distribution in partisan
        political warfare. </p>
        <p>There were many examples of mud infestation in this
        year's Tennessee campaigns. Naifeh, when describing his
        anger, waved a copy of a direct-mail piece used to
        denounce 13 House Democrats for voting ''against honoring
        the Ten Commandments.'' Sundquist referred to dirty
        campaigning in a congressional race. </p>
        <p>Odds are that politicians are going to get a lot
        sicker and a lot madder before things get any better.
        That's because negative campaigning works -- though it
        can be countered and, just maybe, some immunity is
        developing. </p>
        <p>For an example of how MSV works, consider the case of
        Republican state Rep. Shirley Duer vs. Democratic former
        state Rep. Lincoln Davis, who squared off for a state
        Senate seat on the Cumberland Plateau. </p>
        <p>Davis suffered a bad case of MSV affliction a couple
        of years ago and blamed it for losing a race for the 4th
        District congressional nomination. This year, he hired
        the campaign consultant who orchestrated the attack on
        him two years back -- having vowed never to be a victim
        again. </p>
        <p>This year, Davis plastered Duer with mud mailings and
        the like while his allies (the Tennessee Conservative
        Union, for instance) joined in. Duer did not respond in
        kind, though she had a bag of glop available to do so.
        Duer lost. </p>
        <p>On the other side, Democrats tell the tale of Joyce
        Hopson, who they say was urged to go negative on her
        Republican foe, Mark Goins, and refused. Having taken the
        ethical high road, she lost, too (by 150 votes or so, an outcome
        that likely could have changed with just a bit of
        smearing). </p>
        <p>The lesson here, of course, is that when the
        opposition injects a dose of mud into your campaign, you
        darn well better come back with the same. That done, a
        smear balance of sorts seems to often be achieved and
        voters -- albeit perhaps disgusted in the process -- are
        left to follow pre-mud inclinations. </p>
        <p>Perhaps the long-term solution to the disgusting mud
        disease is a general immunity to it within the electorate
        at large. Some immunity does, indeed, seem to be
        developing. </p>
        <p>Of the 13 incumbent Democrats spattered with the Ten
        Commandments attack, for example, perhaps all were
        maddened -- but none was defeated. </p>
        <p>Another example is the aging tax-trasher ads, deemed
        so effective when initially deployed by Republicans a few
        years ago that Democrats began using them, too. </p>
        <p>Now they're so common that it seems more and more
        voters simply ignore the claims that incumbent so-and-so
        has voted for 189 tax increases. Or maybe voters have
        figured out that considerable spreading of baloney is involved. </p>
        <p>Of course, when one strain of MSV becomes ineffective,
        a new one typically springs up to replace it. </p>
        <p>A fine example of new MSV this year came in ads
        implying that incumbent legislators support drunk drivers
        on school buses. It was used against such losers as
        Republican Duer and Democratic Sen. Danny Wallace. Since
        that arguably indicates the strain is a killer, you can
        expect the thing to be trotted out again. </p>
        <p>At some point, however, it just might be that tossing
        such glop into a campaign will hit fully immunized voters
        who will respond only by collectively groaning: ''Give me
        a break! I'm not that stupid.'' </p>
        <p>Then, perhaps, attack ads will have to be truly honest
        and accurate to be effective. And that might make for
        some pretty healthy politicking. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">C</font>hunks of state government -- every
        branch of it -- have become somewhat unglued lately, with
        the detached pieces floating around and waiting to be
        patched back together in some sort of new order. </p>
        <p>Much of this is ritual post-election syndrome, though
        in the legislative branch the turmoil was considerably
        amplified by the elevated nastiness of the campaign
        season past. </p>
        <p>Each election cycle lately has seemed to bring more
        mud-slinging designed to inspire anger within the
        electorate and resulting in more anger within the elected.
        Further, this campaign year was blessed with more than
        its share of the bizarre events. </p>
        <p>Consider, for instance, that re-elected incumbent
        state legislators include a Democratic House member whose
        wife faces trial on a charge of beating up on a
        belligerent woman who supported his opponent and a
        Republican state senator who faces trial on a charge that
        he ran away from a fatal accident. </p>
        <p>While the legislators with trial in their future are
        floating, we have House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh publicly
        proclaiming -- with a verb deemed unfit for publication
        in family-oriented newspapers -- that he sure is mad. And Speaker
        of the Senate John Wilder, while comfortable in the
        cosmos of his senatorial self, has aroused the anger of
        both Democrats and Republicans. </p>
        <p>Further flotsam is provided by the various departures
        of retiring legislators, exemplified by
        retiring-and-out-of-here House Majority Leader Bill
        Purcell to
        step-to-one-side-and-let-someone-else-take-this-grief
        House Minority Leader H.E. Bittle. Purcell is leaving the
        Legislature while Bittle is leaving only leadership, but
        both leave things floating around. </p>
        <p>Leaving the legislative branch of state government,
        things in the executive branch are, just maybe, in an
        even greater state of flux. Gov. Don Sundquist, having
        displayed a reverse Midas touch in most legislative elections
        he touched, is beset by everything from staff desertions
        to attempted power plays that have developed into the
        political equivalent of exploding cigars. </p>
        <p>With the much-respected Bob Corker fleeing the finance
        commissioner scene in advance of major budget problems
        and low-key-and-quiet-compromiser Billy Stokes exiting
        with hostilities afoot in the hinterlands, the governor
        is left with the combative Peaches Simpkins and Wendell
        Moore (who worked for Lee Atwater back in the late
        national Republican leader's death-to-all-Democrats days)
        as seconds-in-command. </p>
        <p>Apparently at the prodding of Peaches, the governor
        picked a fight with Bryant Millsaps, executive director
        of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, in a manner
        that has caused Democrats who disliked Millsaps to
        remember the saying: ''The enemy of my enemy is my
        friend.'' </p>
        <p>Peaches, too, has left the governor with no choice but
        to back her in what appears an obvious ethical dilemma --
        her maneuvers to make massive personal profits with some
        buddies in a new health-care venture while bossing the
        government that decides how a billion or so health-care
        dollars flow. </p>
        <p>Over in the judicial branch, things are not much
        better and maybe even worse. Justice Penny White got the
        boot on Aug. 1 from voters aroused by supposed anti-death
        penalty rulings that arguably apply equally to at least two
        other members of the unglued court. </p>
        <p>As the four present justices wait around for a fifth
        court member to be patched into their process by
        Sundquist's appointment of White's replacement, they are
        getting somewhat less than total respect -- even from other
        judges. </p>
        <p>Supreme Court Justice Adolpho A. Birch, for example,
        showed up before a study committee last week to say that
        the procedure of judges naming lawyer chums as substitute
        judges was bad for the judicial system's already-tarnished
        image. It created the appearance of ''buddy-buddy justice,''
        he rightly observed. </p>
        <p>Lower-level judges, who like to have a buddy fill in
        while they go golfing on Friday afternoons, roundly
        denounced Birch for his failure to respect cozy tradition. </p>
        <p>All of this means, one suspects, that it's a pretty

		<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><FONT SIZE="+2">G</FONT>ov. Don Sundquist&#39;s administration seems to have suddenly become somewhat ethically challenged, costing him in political capital and public credibility.
<P>    Both assets are likely to be needed in substantial quantity during the months ahead as the governor deals with crises to come -- $200 million in budget cuts in the upcoming year for one obvious example.
<P>    The Sundquist political capital bank account was already drawn down when this month&#39;s ethical challenges began to emerge. The Republican governor lost a lot in campaign investments by backing a bunch of losers, so the election left him with fewer friends in the Legislature and, arguably, angrier enemies.
<P>    That didn&#39;t stop the spending spree. He promptly lost a bundle of political capital -- and likely some public credibility, too -- in a post-election power play to fire his former friend, Bryant Millsaps, as director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission.
<P>    Working through Deputy Gov. Peaches Simpkins, Sundquist blatantly had to stack the THEC board with new appointees to win what may prove to be a very hollow victory in political gamesmanship.
<P>    Sundquist and Simpkins leveled only vague &#39;&#39;failure-to-communicate&#39;&#39; accusations against Millsaps and thus flopped on the first November ethical challenge.
<P>    Other developments raise questions about their own communication skills:
<P>    * At the urging of Democratic state Sen. John Ford of Memphis, a fellow occasionally regarded as somewhat ethically challenged in some quarters, the administration raised the possibility of easing conflict-of-interest rules to allow some state officials to make money from the $3billion TennCare program. The easing, too, just might allow Simpkins to jump into a new for-profit health care venture -- one that she has apparently already promoted somewhat while sitting in her present position of power.
<P>    Despite criticism (a Memphis newspaper editorial opined, for example, that the situation &#39;&#39;reeks&#39;&#39;), the initial administration reaction was hand-wringing over how that nasty old conflicts-of-interest clause is so broad that it could trap some unwary official.
<P>    Later, rising to the ethical challenge, Sundquist announced he would leave the clause alone -- though exceptions to allow TennCare profiteering would be made on a case-by-case basis. But he deflected questions on the ethical propriety of such doings and refused to rule out approving profit-for-Peaches in the future.
<P>    * The FBI has been collecting documents and conducting interviews about some perhaps questionable past insurance business dealings of Sundquist&#39;s current insurance commissioner, Douglas Sizemore. The commissioner, meanwhile, has been somewhat evasive about the exact ownership status of the insurance business now.
<P>    The administration&#39;s initial response was the old stonewalling routine. Sizemore later was prodded from hiding by gubernatorial aides to explain that he might have technically stayed in the insurance business six months after becoming the state&#39;s top insurance regulator, but it&#39;s all ethically in his son&#39;s hands.
<P>    The Sizemore situation may thus be closer to closure than the TennCare turmoil, even though the pattern of belated response to an ethical challenge was still followed.
<P>    * Another commissioner, Justin Wilson of the Department of Environment and Conservation, has been blistered by black legislators and the state employees association for an allegedly racist remark.
<P>    Wilson did, at least, step forward to say his remark was misinterpreted and to apologize for any offense given -- even before the matter was publicized. (Sundquist himself planned a subsequent visit to the Legislature&#39;s Black Caucus to soothe the troubled waters.)
<P>    The eccentric Wilson has otherwise shown signs of competency in controversies.
<P>    But, of course, he is to be replaced soon by Sundquist in a political payoff to former state Sen. Milton Hamilton of Union City. (Hamilton, having deserted the Democratic Party with Sundquist&#39;s encouragement, is being rewarded with Wilson&#39;s job.)
<P>    In other words, the governor is still paying out of his political capital account while his public confidence balance is, at best, stagnant.
<P>    If we were dealing with a state budget, it would be time to look at revenue enhancement -- a call for members of the administration to pay a higher ethical tax in their activities. If that&#39;s not an option, there  should at least some major cuts in spending.

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">L</font>eonard Ray Blanton, whose funeral
        was held a week ago today, did more to change the course
        of Tennessee politics through mistake than most governors
        before or since did through design. </p>
        <p>One can make a pretty good case that, without the
        public outrage over Blanton administration scandals,
        Republican Lamar Alexander might never have been elected
        governor in his 1978 campaign. </p>
        <p>Even as he campaigned for the presidency this year,
        Alexander was still making Blanton part of his stump
        speech. (He daily told about entering the governor's
        office to clean up after the darkness of ''the most
        corrupt administration in the state's history'' and
        exiting a state known as ''rising, shining Tennessee.'') </p>
        <p>Republican Sen. Fred Thompson would certainly never
        have been an actor and likely not a senator without the
        Blanton administration misdeeds as a launching pad. (His
        first acting job, in the movie ''Marie,'' involved
        playing himself, since he was lawyer for Marie
        Ragghianti, fired by Blanton as state Paroles Board
        chairman.) </p>
        <p>Besides helping send individual Republicans on their
        way to fame and fortune while he was left infamous and
        broke, Blanton also provided something of a reverse role
        model for Tennessee politicians in general. </p>
        <p>His greatest personal faults were a sizeable streak of
        arrogance, which was occasionally blatantly displayed to
        the media or the public, and a tendency to place his
        trust in people who did not deserve trust. </p>
        <p>His greatest personal attributes were a willingness to
        stand up for people or principles, even when politically
        unpopular to do so (as in the case of favoring a state
        income tax and opposing capital punishment), and an identification
        with common folk. </p>
        <p>No evidence was ever offered that Blanton personally
        profited from the sale of clemency to criminals, though
        trusted aides did. Evidence indicates other friends
        arranged the illegal sale of liquor licenses that
        ultimately sent him to prison. </p>
        <p>He did some good things as governor, ranging from new
        initiatives in economic development that paid off after
        he was gone to a civil service protection system for
        state employees that's still working pretty well today. </p>
        <p>Blanton's status as a reverse role model may be seen
        in many other behavior patterns. For a specific, there's
        the extreme reluctance of governors to grant clemency to
        criminals even in arguably deserving cases. (Gov. Ned
        McWherter did it only twice in eight years, and Sundquist
        hasn't done it yet). </p>
        <p>For a generality, there's the extreme enthusiasm of
        governors for public relations people and consultants who
        coach them in choosing words and deeds that avoid
        offense. </p>
        <p>Even in current political rhetoric, Blanton's name is
        still publicly evoked. Not so long ago, for example, a
        Democratic legislator denouncing Gov. Don Sundquist
        called him ''the most partisan governor since Ray
        Blanton.'' </p>
        <p>(That was ironic, since the subject was the supposed
        bypassing of civil service protection for state workers
        by Sundquist. The always-loyal-to-my-folks Blanton had
        put the civil service system in place as a means of
        protecting the people he hired after he was gone.) </p>
        <p>When it comes to partisanship, of course, none of our
        post-Blanton governors could compare to the man who set
        up patronage committees in every county and checked
        Democratic credentials of all job applicants. </p>
        <p>Ditto on blatant political power plays. The recent
        ouster of Bryant Millsaps as director of the Tennessee
        Higher Education Commission, engineered by Deputy Gov.
        Peaches Simpkins at Sundquist's behest, was stunning to many
        because it was so open. </p>
        <p>Simpkins, by the way, got her start in state
        government when hired during the Blanton era. (She once
        said she's wasn't sure exactly why but suspected that
        Blanton was impressed with her when she served as a
        delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention.) </p>
        <p>The Millsaps maneuver even caused some government
        groupies to wonder if, just maybe, Sundquist was easing
        into one aspect of Blantonish behavior -- namely,
        willingness to take a stand that could be unpopular or
        politically damaging. </p>
        <p>Not likely, of course. Indeed, Simpkins' decision last
        week to leave the Sundquist administration on Dec. 31 may
        help assure the dulling of any developing edge and help
        send Tennessee politicking back toward the bland. </p>
        <p>Sundquist attended Blanton's funeral, as did
        McWherter. In commenting on his death, Sundquist kindly
        called for remembrance of the good things the late
        governor did, not the bad. </p>
        <p>That was certainly appropriate and commendable. But
        sadly, it's not very likely. </p>

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Tom Humphrey, News-Sentinel Nashville bureau chief</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>famous line from the 1960s movie &#39;&#39;Cool Hand Luke&#39;&#39; -- delivered by a prison warden unhappy with inmate activities -- has been recycled into regular service recently by Gov. Don Sundquist&#39;s administration.
<P>    Said the warden character to Luke, who was played by actor Paul Newman: &#39;&#39;What we have here is a failure to communicate.&#39;&#39;
<P>    In the last few weeks, this sentence seems to have gotten more usage in administration circles than the official new state theme line that the governor approved by executive order a while back. In case you missed it, the theme line is &#39;&#39;Tennessee: Sounds good to me.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The governor, or other characters in administration roles, have used the failure-to-communicate theme line to explain, for example:
<P>    * The shortcomings of Bryant Millsaps that warranted Sundquist&#39;s successful push to fire him as executive director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission. The denunciation of Millsaps&#39; failure to communicate came about 18 months after Sundquist supported Millsaps for the job.
<P>    * A $70 million or so &#39;&#39;oops&#39;&#39; in miscalculating how much new state funding would be needed to cover education improvements in next year&#39;s budget. (Until recently, the administration was figuring $125 million; now it&#39;s around $195 million.) 
<P>    It occurs that use of the real state theme line might have been equally enlightening in these situations and certainly much less mundane.
<P>    As in, &#39;&#39;Hire Bryant Millsaps in 1995? Sounds good to me. . . . Fire Bryant Millsaps in 1996? Sounds good to me.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Or, &#39;&#39;$70 million more? Sounds good to me.&#39;&#39; 
<P>    The sound of communications collapse also echoed through the administration&#39;s recent attack on conflict-of-interest rules in TennCare contracts (followed by a full-scale retreat to the status quo) and, just last week, in the curious case of Ralph Perrey, whose title is assistant to the governor for strategic planning.
<P>    Seems that Perrey called up a victims&#39; rights advocate, Rebecca Easley, and promised to set up a meeting between such advocates and newly appointed state Supreme Court Justice Janice Holder.
<P>    Apparently, however, he didn&#39;t tell Sundquist, other staffers or Holder about this. No one had a chance to say, &#39;&#39;Sounds good to me.&#39;&#39; What we had was failure to communicate.
<P>    But then Perrey actually went considerably beyond that. When other Sundquist staffers and reporters started asking about the curious communication, he flatly denied that he ever made such a call and that Easley made it up -- until, that is, Easley came up with a tape recording of Perrey making such a call.
<P>    The incriminating tape, a message left on Easley&#39;s telephone answering machine, may have left Easley saying, &#39;&#39;Sounds good to me.&#39;&#39; (Without it as proof in refuting Ralph, she would have stood an accused liar.)
<P>    An admittedly embarrassed Sundquist subsequently said that Perrey &#39;&#39;misrepresented the facts to my senior staff, reporters and the public.&#39;&#39; For a change, he did not use the words &#39;&#39;failure to communicate.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Perrey himself, whose duties include writing many of Sundquist&#39;s speeches, used the phrase &#39;&#39;boneheaded mistake&#39;&#39; in the process of repentance and apology. (Just as a tribute to Ralph&#39;s wordsmith skills: Sounds good to me.)
<P>    Unlike Millsaps, Perrey was not fired for his communication failures, though he was suspended for a few days. Maybe that contrast doesn&#39;t sound so good, at least insofar as the murky Millsaps matter goes.
<P>    As for Perrey, the governor explained that the foul-up was way out of character for a fellow who had worked years for him -- starting back in Sundquist&#39;s tenure as a congressmen -- and he figured that Perrey should have another chance. (Just as a tribute to Ralph&#39;s past performance in a personal acquaintance: Sounds good to me.)
<P>    As for the administration as a whole, is it fair to say that what we sometimes have here is a failure to communicate? Sounds good to me.

        to leave some cookies and milk, but with the budget
        problems and all, Martha says we can't afford it.)'' </p>
        <p>''To Saint Politicized Cause: </p>
        <p>''It is hereby ordered, adjudged and decreed that in
        the calendar year 1997 you shall provide for appeals to
        be filed with this court of not less than one dozen (12)
        death penalty cases, all of said cases in such legal
        status as to permit affirmation of convictions and
        sentences by this court without reservation prior to the
        1998 Supreme Court retention election. Provided, further,
        that you will cause the American Civil Liberties Union to
        launch a media campaign denouncing the court as too
        conservative. </p>
        <p>''Signed, </p>
        <p>''Justices of the Tennessee Supreme Court. </p>
        <p>''Hey PC Santa: </p>
        <p>''Best to you, buddy! Say, for me this Xmas, how about
        wrapping a big bow, tightly, around the mouth of Bryant
        Millsaps, Jimmy Naifeh and anybody else who's spoken
        unkindly of me lately -- especially those media scumbags
        (not my husband, of course). And give Hardy Mays just as
        big a headache that I had being deputy to the governor.
        Just kidding!! Ho, ho, ho! Actually, I could use a
        multi-million dollar private sector business opportunity
        or two. Sure would appreciate it. Or else, big guy. </p>
        <p>''Affectionately, </p>
        <p>''Peaches Simpkins.'' </p>
        <p>''Dearest Mr. Clause: </p>
        <p>''The cosmos is good. The process is working. Speaker
        happy. </p>
        <p>''Speaker asks nothing for himself. Speaker is
        blessed. But, if it is possible, I would most appreciate
        your assistance in assuring that all members of the
        Senate are made comfortable. Especially those I
        campaigned against last fall. </p>
        <p>''Lt. Gov. John Wilder, </p>
        <p>''Speaker of the Senate. </p>
        <p>''Dear PolySanta: </p>
        <p>''Please give us a candidate for governor with the
        political savvy and folksy appeal of Ned McWherter, the
        money and intellectual capacity of Phil Bredesen (but not
        his political savvy and folksy appeal) and the luck of Al
        Gore Jr. It would also be nice if you could arrange for
        Peaches to return to work for Gov. Sundquist.'' </p>
        <p>''Sincerely, </p>
        <p>''Tennessee Democratic Executive Committee.'' </p>
        <p>Briefly: </p>
        <p>From Lamar Alexander: ''. . . a message better than
        'ABC, Alexander Beats Clinton' . . . more charisma than
        Bob Dole . . . campaign finance reform so my friends can
        give me $20million or so, quick . . . and a sense of
        contentment for Fred Thompson, so he stays in the Senate
        rather than running for president.'' </p>
        <p>From Al Gore Jr.: ''. . . so, do not concern yourself
        with any request from me this year. Please allow my
        wishes to accumulate until the year 2000, when I will be
        asking for a big one.'' </p>
        <p>From Fred Thompson: ''Just keep it coming like you
        have been -- a photogenic truck, a photogenic momma, lots
        of money and opponents like Houston Gordon and Jim
        Cooper.'' </p>

<TITLE>DOE'S 1997 BUDGET NEWS WILL BE TARDY</TITLE>
</HEAD>

 <I>January 31, 1996</I>

<BR CLEAR=ALL><HR NOSPACE Size=1><H2>DOE'S 1997 BUDGET NEWS WILL BE TARDY</H2>


The federal budget news for Oak Ridge in fiscal 1997 will come even later than usual this time around, according to the Department of Energy.<P>

    A DOE spokesman said: ``We understand that the president's proposed 1997 budget will be submitted to Congress on Feb. 5, but the details with specifics on various Oak Ridge programs is tentatively scheduled to be submitted in mid-March.... At that time, we will have some kind of briefing.... We can't comment on the proposed budget until then.''<P>

    Ordinarily, the proposed budget gets a thorough exam soon after the president's State of the Union address in late January or early February.<P>

    But, as the current budget chaos had already made obvious, things are different nowadays.<P>

<P>

   <B> CHOO-CHOO TALKING:</B> Round two of the economic and technology summit held last summer in Oak Ridge is scheduled for the last week in May, and Chattanooga will host the affair -- as announced at the end of the much-ballyhooed 1995 meeting.<P>

    This year's sessions are being labeled Summit '96, apparently an effort to get away from site-specific tags (such as the Oak Ridge Summit). The conference also will be a day longer this year.<P>

    Vice President Al Gore, who was unable to attend last year, reportedly has given organizers a tentative commitment for the 1996 event. The exact date of Gore's participation, however, is uncertain.<P>

  <B>  JOBS AND MORE JOBS:</B> DOE has revised upward the number of Oak Ridge employees who will be affected by mandatory furloughs later this year.<P>

    Earlier, a DOE spokesman estimated that about 200 DOE employees would be forced to take off six days without pay to satisfy an order from agency headquarters in Washington.<P>

    Now, however, that number is expected to exceed 350 employees -- about half of the work force at DOE's Oak Ridge operations.<P>

    The employees, of course, are not happy at all.<P>

    The order only affects those who are paid under the administrative part of DOE's budget allotment. Those who work with funds for specific programs, such as energy research, defense and environmental cleanup, are not involved.<P>

    ``It's not fair,'' one DOE worker said. He undoubtedly spoke for many others.<P>

    Meanwhile, several Lockheed Martin employees have called in recent weeks and asked why the newspaper wasn't reporting on layoffs at the Oak Ridge plants.<P>

    The reason is that these actions are part of the job reductions announced in 1995 but are just now being carried out. Each of the affected divisions or organizations in Lockheed Martin has made its own assessment and identified the workers who must leave the payroll.<P>

    The company earlier said the downsizing would affect 200 to 400 employees, and spokeswoman Carol Grametbauer said that hasn't changed.<P>

    ``It won't exceed that,'' she said.<P>

   <B> WASTE NOT:</B> Despite its continuing controversy, the Department of Energy is still promoting the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant and insists that the disposal site for transuranic wastes -- such as those containing plutonium and other dangerous radionuclides -- is on track for opening in 1998.<P>

    In an interview published this month in Weapons Complex Monitor, DOE's manager at the Carlsbad, N.M., site, said the target date is April 1998, and he strongly defended the need for WIPP (whose critics are legion).<P>

    ``Opening WIPP is really a keystone in addressing the cleanup problems at all of the DOE sites,'' George Dials said. ``You can restack the barrels, you can put them in new temporary storage containers or buildings, but you really can't begin a permanent cleanup until we have a permanent disposal site to accept the transuranic wastes.<P>

    ``That's why we think opening WIPP is a keystone and a very important first step in addressing the nation's nuclear waste disposal problems.''  <P>

    If WIPP opens, DOE's Oak Ridge plants are not expected to be among the early shippers. That distinction probably will go to nuclear sites in Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico and South Carolina that have a lot of plutonium-contaminated wastes in storage.<P>

    Oak Ridge National Laboratory doesn't have a lot of waste in that category. However, the lab has most of the nation's ``remote-handled'' transuranic wastes, which includes materials -- such as radioactive californium -- that are too hot to handle except remotely.<P>

<H4>AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERS PREMIUMS ARE EASIER THAN YOU THINK</H4>The price you pay for homeowners insurance can vary by hundreds of dollars depending on which insurance company you choose. However, you can lower your insurance costs by asking your company about any applicable discounts and by also doing some careful shopping. The Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS) offers the following tips:<P><UL><LI>Raise your deductible. The deductible on your policy is the amount you agree to pay for an insured loss. A typical deductible for a homeowners policy is $250. Depending on your insurance company, if you increase your deductible to $500, you can save up to 12 percent; to $1,000, you can save up to 24 percent; to $2,500 you can save up to 30 percent; and to $5,000 you can save up to 37 percent. The higher your deductible, the lower your premium will be.<P><LI>Buy your home and auto policies from the same insurance company. Some companies will offer discounts from 5 to 15 percent if you buy your homeowners and auto insurance policy from them.<P><LI>If you buy a new home, take into account how much it will cost to insure it. Some insurance companies will offer discounts of 8 to 15 percent if your home is brand new. You can also save 5 to 15 percent if you consider the construction of your home. For example, a frame construction provides better resistance to earthquake damage which can reduce your premium. In addition, the closer your home is to a fire station or hydrant, the lower your premium.<P><LI>Don't include the value of the land in your homeowners policy. The land isn't at risk from theft, fire or other insured perils stated in your policy.<P><LI>Beef up your home security. Install a smoke detector, burglar alarm or dead-bolt locks. Some insurance companies offer discounts if you install a sophisticated sprinkler system and fire and burglar alarm that rings at the police station or other monitoring facility.<P><LI>Don't smoke. Some insurance companies will offer discounts if all residents in your home don't smoke.<P><LI>See if you are eligible for senior discounts. If you're at least 55 years old and retired, some insurance companies offer discounts.<P><LI>Ask about group coverages. Some insurance companies offer competitive rates for employers, alumni and business associations.<P><LI>Shop around. Compare prices with several insurance companies before buying your homeowners policy. Consult friends, consumer guides, your state insurance department and insurance agents and companies to get an idea of price ranges. Also consider the quality of service the insurance company will be able to provide as well as their financial rating.<P></UL>If you would like more information on homeowners insurance, WIIS has available the following publications: "12 Ways to Lower Your Homeowners Insurance Costs," "Insurance for Your House and Personal Possessions," and "Taking Inventory." For free copies, please send a self-addressed stamped business envelope to Western Insurance Information Service, 3530 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1610, Los Angeles, CA 90010.<P>Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues. For more information on how to arrange for a speaker, please contact us at (800) 397-1679.<P>

<H4>TIPS FOR DRIVERS: PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST UNINSURED MOTORISTS</H4>All states have laws that require drivers to show proof of their financial ability to pay personal injury or property damage to others in the event of an accident. Most motorists satisfy this requirement by purchasing insurance -- but many cannot afford or ignore this legal and financial obligation. This means that responsible drivers who carry insurance must bear the burden of paying for damages to their vehicle caused by someone who has no insurance at all.<P>The Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS) offers the following tips on how to protect yourself against uninsured motorists, what to do if an uninsured motorist hits you and what steps to take if you are involved in an accident.<P><H4>CONSIDER BUYING UNINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE</H4><P>Insurance agents and companies are required by law to offer uninsured motorist coverage when you buy auto insurance. Uninsured motorist coverage pays for bodily injuries caused by an uninsured motorist or a hit and run driver who is legally responsible for the accident. In most states, it also applies to injuries caused by a motorist whose insurance company is insolvent.<P>This coverage applies to you, family members and guests in the car. It also provides protection when you are in someone else's car or if you are hit while walking. Your insurance company will pay for damages to injured persons up to the minimum limits prescribed by the financial responsibility laws of your state. Higher limits may be available.<P>You may also consider buying underinsured motorist coverage which pays you for damages caused by a motorist who does not have enough liability insurance to fully cover your damages. <P><H4>PRACTICE DEFENSIVE DRIVING</H4><P>It's our responsibility to exercise caution on the road to help prevent any accidents. You can protect yourself from erratic drivers by concentrating on the following: <P><UL><LI>Other drivers (give that weaving motorist space)<LI>The road (watch out for unexpected curves and potholes)<LI>Traffic (allow more following distance during rush hours)<LI>The weather (will the upcoming bridge be icy?)<LI>Your vehicle (you can't rely on a car that's not in good running condition)<LI>The light (can other drivers see you at night?)</UL><P>Also avoid driving when you are angry, sleepy, sick or otherwise distracted. When you are driving at night, take extra precaution as the nighttime traffic death rate is almost 10 percent higher than the daytime rate.<P><H4>IF AN UNINSURED MOTORIST HITS YOU</H4>Insurance agents and brokers strongly advise that you get the license plate number of the vehicle, name and drivers license number of the driver and the names of any witnesses. Notify your agent about this information immediately so that they can start processing your claim.<P>If you don't have uninsured motorist coverage, you may be able to use the collision coverage of your policy to pay for damages. If it seems unlikely that the uninsured motorist will pay for any damages, your last resort would be a lawsuit which can be expensive.<P<H4>WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE IN AN ACCIDENT</H4><TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>Step 1:</TD><TD>Call for medical help if anyone is injured.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP >Step 2:</TD><TD>Call the police and do not leave the scene of the accident until they arrive.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP >Step 3:</TD><TD>Get the names, addresses, phone numbers, insurance company numbers and drivers licenses of all parties involved in the accident (witnesses and passengers). Also get the year, make, model and license plate number of all cars.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP >Step 4:</TD><TD>Write down the details of the accident--time of day, weather and road conditions, and driving speed. You may also want to sketch a diagram of the site of the accident including street names, traffic signals and the direction of the cars. If you have a camera, you should take pictures.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP >Step 5:</TD><TD>Notify your insurance agent or company immediately. Get a copy of the police report and save copies of everything.</TD></TR></TABLE><H4>WHAT <EM>NOT</EM> TO DO IF YOU ARE IN AN ACCIDENT</H4><UL><LI>Move any injured persons.<LI>Apologize for the accident.<LI>Tell any party how much insurance you carry. You should only discuss what types of coverages you have.<LI>Accept any money. If you do, you forfeit your right to file any claims.<LI>Agree to forget about the accident. Later on, the other person may file a lawsuit against you.</UL><P>Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues.

<P><B>AETNA TO SELL PROPERTY/CASUALTY OPERATIONS TO TRAVELERS FOR $4.0 BILLION </b>
<p>
<EM>Will Focus on Building National Managed Health Care Franchise
and Expanding Retirement Services and International Businesses</EM>
<p>
HARTFORD, Conn. -- Aetna Life and Casualty (NYSE: AET) announced today that, as part of a strategic refocusing of the Company, it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Property/Casualty operations to Travelers Group for total consideration of $4.0 billion in cash.  The sale has been approved by both companies' boards of directors and is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions. 
<p> "The sale of the Property/Casualty business represents an historic shift for Aetna,"  Chairman Ronald E. Compton said.  "We've made a strategic decision to focus on growth opportunities in our managed health care and financial services businesses both in the U.S. and selected international markets. 
<p>
"Health care and retirement security are increasingly central concerns to our customers. Our goal is to make the Aetna name synonymous with best-value products, information and expert advice to help each of them plan for a healthier, more secure future. 
<p>
"Aetna now has three core businesses -- Aetna Health Plans, Aetna Retirement Services and Aetna International -- each with strong market positions and above-average returns.  Each will now have the resources needed to grow and become even more competitive and profitable." 
<p>
Noting that the P/C transaction would by itself be dilutive to 1996 earnings, Compton said, "We are optimistic that earnings from anticipated acquisitions and the aggressive pursuit of a variety of new opportunities made possible by increased scale in our remaining businesses will help to mitigate any dilution in the near term."
<p>
As part of the sale agreement, Travelers has agreed to assume eight years of Aetna's lease at CityPlace in downtown Hartford.  Upon completion of the transaction, the facility will house the P/C employees currently located at Aetna's headquarters complex. Aetna employees currently located at CityPlace will in turn relocate to the headquarters complex.  Consistent with its focus on eliminating unnecessary costs, Aetna expects to take an approximately $190 million after-tax charge for the remaining CityPlace lease obligation at the close of the transaction.
<p>
Aetna Health Plans (AHP) is the country's third largest health care company in this rapidly growing, nearly $1 trillion market.  In addition to providing health care coverage through health maintenance organizations, point-of-service plans, preferred provider organizations and traditional fee-for-service plans, AHP also offers a broad range of specialty health and group insurance products.  In total, AHP products and services reach 19 million Americans.  The company serves 25 percent of the Fortune 1000 and 19,000 employers overall. AHP's 1994 revenues were $7.1 billion and operating earnings were $355 million. 
<p>
"Aetna has been investing heavily in the health business to broaden our managed care capabilities, increase membership in key markets and create new managed health care programs that customers increasingly demand," Compton said.  "As part of that strategy, we will look for opportunities to make strategic investments or acquisitions to further strengthen our overall position. With consolidation in the industry and a shift to managed care, we expect to see the emergence of a handful of leading national managed health care providers. Aetna intends to be the best of them."
<p>
Aetna's financial services business markets a variety of retirement, investment and life insurance products to individuals, businesses and not-for-profit institutions. Assets under management as of  September 30, 1995 were $71.2 billion. These businesses contributed $234.3 million to Aetna's operating earnings in 1994.  "Aetna has built a strong position in several important retirement market niches," Compton said.  "We are working to strengthen our position as an equity fund and financial planning provider, and broaden our distribution channels to give customers easier access to our products and services. We are exploring investments and acquisitions to achieve that goal.  This market is growing at about 15 percent a year, fueled by the aging of the baby boomers and their concerns about gaps in their retirement benefits.  We see real opportunities here." 
<p>
Aetna International has an established and strong position in key emerging markets including Chile, Mexico, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Malaysia. Aetna's international businesses offer health care, financial security and retirement planning products and services to approximately 2.5 million customers in 10 countries.  The company expects to continue developing its current international operations and to penetrate new markets where suitable opportunities exist. International's operating earnings in 1994 were $69 million.
<p>
In 1994, Aetna's Property/Casualty business, which includes personal and commercial insurance, accounted for $5.3 billion of Aetna's total revenues of $17.5 billion and $60 million of Aetna's $510 million in operating earnings.  It employs approximately 11,600 of the company's 41,000 workers.
<p>
"We have been pleased with improving results in our P/C business," Compton said.  "The combination with Travelers' P/C business will create a powerhouse P/C operation.  For this reason, we have agreed with Travelers -- separate from the P/C sale agreement -- to invest up to $200 million in a potential 1996 offering of common stock in the new entity.  
<p>
 "The transformation under way at Aetna will create an even stronger company, headquartered in Hartford, that will continue to be a leading corporate citizen and employer in the communities where we do business," Compton said.

se price was approximately $1.125 billion which was financed through a five-year bank revolving credit facility. The merger makes CNA the largest U.S. commercial lines insurer, the third largest U.S. property-casualty organization and the sixth largest U.

S. insurance group, based on 1994 premium volume. 
<P>
Dennis H. Chookaszian, chairman and chief executive officer of the CNA Insurance Companies, said, "CNA continues to perform well. Our third quarter results reflect the outstanding efforts of CNA employees to stay focused on our customers while integrating

 the CNA and Continental organizations."
<P>
Mr. Chookaszian said, "We are well on the way to consolidating the operations, products and systems of the two companies within a one-year time frame. The combined strengths of CNA and Continental will help us build a world-class insurance organization."
<P>
Mr. Chookaszian indicated that the results for the first nine months of 1995 were positively affected by improved loss ratios in property-casualty insurance, the absence of significant catastrophe losses and favorable investment results. 
<P>
Edward J. Noha, chairman of the board, CNA Financial Corporation, said, 
"In all its businesses, CNA is well positioned to meet the challenges of 
customer service, growth and profitability in an intensely competitive 
insurance marketplace."

<P><b>AETNA LIFE AND CASUALTY - QUESTIONS TO ASK WHEN CHOOSING A HEALTH PLAN</b>
<P>MIDDLETOWN, Conn., September 26, 1995: -- "Should I join an HMO or a PPO?" "What's the difference between the two?" "Should I stay in the indemnity plan I've had all these years?" These are some of the questions millions of working Americans will be asking this fall as they select a health insurance plan from the growing array of options offered by their employers.<P>But before making this important decision, people should be sure they have a clear picture of their personal health care needs, according to Dr. A. Bruce Campbell, chief medical officer for Aetna Health Plans (AHP).<P>
"All of us are different, and we all need different things from our health plans,"  says Dr. Campbell. "It's important to make sure your plan can deliver the benefits you need."<P>
He offers the following examples:<ul><li>If you're a young couple planning to start a family or if you already have children, you'll need a plan that covers preventive services such as prenatal care, well-baby visits and childhood immunizations.<br><br><li>If you or one of your dependents is an older person, you may need a plan that provides coverage for long term care and prescription drugs.<br><br><li>If you or a family member have special medical needs, or if someone in your family will be having surgery in the near future, you should determine if that condition is covered. If you're in a managed health care network and have a close relationship with a particular specialist, check to see if he or she is part of the network.<br><br><li>If you're a woman in your 30s or 40s and have regular checkups, you'll want to join a plan that pays for those visits, as well as for other preventive measure such as mammograms, Pap smears and breast exams.<br><br><li>If you're young, single and healthy, and don't visit the doctor that often, you might be served best by an indemnity plan with a higher deductible and a lower monthly contribution.</ul><P>
"Every health plan has its unique advantages," says Dr. Campbell. "What matters most, however, is whether that plan provides the best options for you."

	<H3>The St. Paul Companies Reports Record Earnings for 1995</H3>

	<P>ST. PAUL, Minn.  For the third consecutive year, The St. Paul Companies (NYSE:SPC) has generated record earnings.

	<P>"Operating earnings increased 12 percent, and net income was up 18 percent over 1994," said Douglas W. Leatherdale, chairman and chief executive officer. "The St. Paul's capital base has never been stronger.  Common shareholders' equity grew $1 billion in the last year, to $3.7 billion, as a result of strong earnings and growth in the realized and unrealized appreciation in our investment portfolio."

	<P>Operating earnings were $464.9 million, or $5.07 per share, for 1995, compared with $413.9 million, or $4.60 per share, for 1994.

	<P>Net income for 1995 was $521.2 million, or $5.68 per share, compared with net income of $442.8 million, or $4.93 per share, for 1994.  1995 net income included after-tax realized investment gains of $56.3 million, or $0.61 per share, compared with $28.9 million, or $0.33 per share, in 1994.

	<P>"Our underwriting operations performed well in 1995," Leatherdale said.  "Our domestic underwriting operation, St. Paul Fire and Marine, recorded an 11 percent increase in premium volume while maintaining a high level of profitability in a very competitive marketplace. 

	<P>"Our reinsurance operation, St. Paul Re, and our international underwriting operation, St. Paul International, both experienced improved results and strong growth.

	<P>"Minet, The St. Paul's insurance brokerage operation, continued to struggle in a difficult worldwide market, producing a $13 million pretax loss in 1995.

	<P>"Our share of The John Nuveen Company's pretax earnings was a record $88 million in 1995, the result of lower interest rates and successful expense management," Leatherdale said.  The St. Paul owns 78 percent of Nuveen.

	<P><STRONG>Fourth-Quarter Results</STRONG>

	<P>Fourth-quarter results were impacted by $25 million in catastrophe losses, most notably from Hurricane Opal. 

	<P>For the fourth quarter of 1995, operating earnings were $124.6 million, or $1.34 per share, compared with operating earnings of $126.5 million, or $1.41 per share, for the fourth quarter of 1994.

	<P>Net income for the fourth quarter of 1995 was $155.2 million, or $1.67 per share, compared with net income of $120.8 million, or $1.35 per share, for the fourth quarter of 1994.  Net income for the fourth quarter of 1995 included after-tax realized investment gains of $30.6 million, or $0.33 per share, compared with after-tax investment losses of $5.7 million, or ($0.06) per share, in 1994.   

	<P><STRONG>Consolidated Financial Position</STRONG>

	<P>Consolidated assets of The St. Paul Companies as of Dec. 31, 1995, were $19.7 billion, compared with $17.5 billion as of Dec. 31, 1994.
Common shareholders' equity was $3.7 billion on Dec. 31, 1995, compared with $2.7 billion on Dec. 31, 1994.  Book value per common share on Dec. 31, 1995, was $44.29, compared with $32.46 on Dec. 31, 1994.

	<P>The St. Paul Companies, headquartered in Saint Paul, Minn., is a group of companies that provides property-liability insurance underwriting and insurance brokerage products and services throughout the world.

<H4>CARJACKING AND AUTO THEFT -- PREVENTION IS THE BEST PROTECTION</H4><P> Consider this: Every 20 seconds, a motor vehicle is stolen in the United States. Auto theft is a lucrative business, not because the cars stolen are necessarily valuable, but because thier parts are in great demand. Chopped up into their parts, cars are worth many times more than their book values.<P>Carjacking, the theft of vehicle by force or threat of force, has increased significantly in recent years and now accounts for about 2 percent of all auto thefts. Law enforcers say carjacking is not a new crime, but until recently had not been reported separate from other car thefts.<P>The Western Insurance Information Service reminds drivers to be aware of car theft and carjacking attempts and offers the following tips to help drivers reduce the chances of being a victim of a carjacking:<P><UL><LI>Stay alert -- watch out for suspicious people lurking near or moving toward your  vehicle.<LI>Keep all windows closed and doors locked.<LI>Drive in the center lane of the freeway to prevent from being pushed onto the shoulder of the road.<LI> If another car bumps you, stay in your car and drive to the nearest police or fire station.<LI>Don't stop at any isolated pay phones, ATM machines or newspaper stands.<LI>Park in well-lit areas.<LI>If you are ever threatened by a carjacker, consider your own safety and that of your passengers first. Think about your car and whatever belongings you have in it later.</UL>To help prevent car theft attempts, do the following: <UL><LI>Install a security device such as a steering wheel lock, gear shift column lock or car alarm.<LI>Never leave your car with the keys in the ignition, even if it is just for a minute (13% of all stolen vehicles have the keys left in the car).<LI>Since 10% of all stolen cars are towed, make it difficult for your car to be towed    by parking with the front wheels sharply turned to the right or left and applying your emergency brakes.<LI>Put any personal property, expensive items or holiday gifts in the trunk.<LI>Keep your car locked in a garage if possible.<LI>Mark your vehicle identification number (VIN) under the engine hood, trunk lid and battery with paint or permanent marker.<LI>Keep the registration card of your car in your wallet instead of the glove compartment.</UL>Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau also offer free presentations on a variety of insurance, safety and loss prevention issues. For more information on how to arrange for a speaker, please contact us at (800) 397-1679.<P>

  WHO NEEDS RENTERS INSURANCE?<P>
  YOU DO if rent and have stereos cameras computers clothing jewelry  bicycles televisions or other valuables you can't afford to replace  if stolen, damaged or destroyed. A renters policy can protect your  investments - but you must be able to choose a policy wisely to be  sure that all your possessions are covered, and that you don't purchase  too much coverage. This brochure can help you make a decision about  whether or not you might need renters insurance.<P>
  IF YOU RENT... Your landlord's insurance does NOT cover your personal  property or your clothes, stereo, furniture, television, bicycle,  jewelry, personal computer, artword and other items against destruction  or loss. Renters insurance, however, gives you both property and liability  coverage.<P>
  Renters insurance will protect you against losses due to fire or smoke  lightning vandalism theft explosion windstorm water damage from plumbing.<P>
  Renters insurance will also cover you if someone slips and falls in your  home or is injured by any of your possessions and then sues. The insurance  should cover your responsibility to other people injured at your home or  elsewhere, and includes legal defense costs if you are taken to court.<P>
  COMMON QUESTIONS<P>
  Q. Does renters insurance cover all my possessions?  <P>A. It depends. Some possessions - jewelry,     computers - are often subject to a per-catergory theft     limit (for example, some policies have a $5,000 limit for     computers). When seeking information on renters     policies, ask about the various category limits and how     they apply to expensive items you own. You may     purchase a floater, providing additional coverage for     specific items not included in your basic policy.<P>
  Q. If I file a claim, will my policy be canceled? <P> A. Your rates could change. If you are not responsible for     the loss of damage to your items, your insurance should     not be affectd. If you were at fault (caused a fire by     smoking in Bed), the insurance company might consider     that when setting the price for your next policy. Your     company might consider the number of losses, regardless of     fault, also.<P>
  Q. Is my property covered away from home?  A. Yes, but coverage may be limited. Restrictions in temrs     and the amount of coverage might apply (from 10 percent of     your personal property coverage to full value). Ask your     agent for details. Your liability coverage does not change.<P>
  Q. As a student, am I covered by my parents' policy?  <P>A. If you are attending college, under 26 and your parents     have a homeowner or renters insurance policy, their     insurance may give you LIMITED coverage in the dorm, but     not if you live in an apartment.<P>
  Q. Can I purchase a renters policy with my roomates?  <P>A. If you live in a group house or share an apartment and     want to purchase renters insurance, be aware that the     regulations vary state to state, and policies vary     significantly from company to company. Find out what     regulations apply in your state. Then, shop around to find     an insurance company that can accomodate your     situation. Also, find out whether your policy needs to be     updated if you get a new roommate or if all your     roommates need to be named under the policy.<P>
  Q. What about unmarried couples? <P> A. Some insurance companies now allow unmarried     couples who have been living together to obtain coverage.     Some policies automatically extend coverage to any future     resident of a policyholder's household who fits the     definition of domestic partner.<P>
  Q. What happens if my rented or borrowed items are stolen? <P> A. Items that are "in your possession" are covered under a standard     renters policy.<P>
  Q. What if my insurance company does not respond to a claim?  <P>A. Your state insurance department or local consumer protection office     can answer questions on filing cliams and also take complaints. (See     back of this brochure for insurance department telephone numbers.)<P>
  Q. Is my bicycle or car covered by renters insurance?  <P>A. Your bike is protected by a standard renters insurance policy.     Motor vehicles are not covered. A separate insurance policy is needed     to protect your car, van or motorcycle.<P>
  HOW DO YOU BUY RENTERS INSURANCE?<P>
  1. TAKE AN INVENTORY. Before purchasing, make an  itemized list of everything you own with price estimates  and purchase dates (if possible). Your inventory will help  ensure that you purchase the right amount of insurance - not  too much or too little. Also, an inventory will help make filing a  cliam easier. Make copies of this inventory and keep it in a safe  place outside of your home (at work, in a safe-deposit box or  friend's house). Take photographs of each item; this can be  helpful when filing a claim.<P>
  2. ASK ABOUT.<P>
      A. THEFT LIMITS: For example, most  renters policies have a $1,000 total limit on jewelry that is  stolen, a $3,000 - $10,000 limit for computers and $2,500 -  for a list of standard coverage limits so you know whether you'll  need to buy a floater, which provides additional coverage for  some of your items.<P>
      B. CASH OR REPLACEMENT VALUE: Your policy can insure  possessions one of two ways - for either the cash or the  replacement value. Cash value coverage takes into account the  age and condition of items at the time of damage or loss.  Replacement value pays today's cost of a new item. For  instance, if your five-year-old TV is stolen, a cash value policy  will pay part of the original purchase price while a replacement  policy will pay the current price of a comparable set.  Replacement value policies tend to cost more, and there may be  other requirements as well.<P>
      C. DEDUCTIBLE OPTIONS. Find out about the deductible - your  out-of-pocket cost. The lower the deductible, the more the  policy will cost you.<P>
  3. SEEK DISCOUNTS. Insurance companies frequently offer     discounts to theri auto policyholders interested in buying a     renters policy from them. You also may be eligible for     discounts if your apartment or home has a security system, smoke     detectors, or deadbolt locks. Additional discounts may be     available depending on your age or whether you are a non-smoker.     Policies vary. Examine as many options as possible.<P>
  4. SHOP AROUND. Find an insurance agent or insurance     company representative with whom you are comfortable.     Ask friends or relatives or consult the yellow pages. Call     a variety of insurance companies and agents. Ask questions.     Keep your inventory handy, so you can find the amount of     coverage that is most appropriate for you ($16,000 is usually     the smallest amount of coverage you can get).<P>
  5. READ YOUR POLICY. An insurance policy is a contract     between you and oyour insuarnce ocmapny. REad the     policy carefully - if you have questions or if something     is unclear, call your insurance company representative. Don't     sign the contract unless you fully understand the company's     responsibilities as well as your own.     An insurance policy spells out several obligations for both you     and the company. For example, the comapny has a duty to defend     the insured renter in court if the renter is sued. On the other hand,     you must give the insurer complete, accurate and timely information.<P>

  REPLACEMENT COSTS: Cost to replace property without regard to age or       condition of the original item.<P>
  THEFT LIMIT: The highest amount an insurance comapny will pay on certain       items that are stolen from your home. For instance, some policies have       a $5,000 limit for computers. If an item would cost more than the       limit to replace, you may need to purchase suppelmentary coverage.<P>
  HOW DO YOU FILE A CLAIM?<P>
  As soon as you become aware of a loss, write down  everyting - the date, time of day, list of goods stolen or  damaged. Call the police as soon as possible. Then, contact  your insurance company or agent to report the loss and tget  the appropriate cliams form. Written and documented  reports of losses are especially important when theft is  involved. Include everything and carefully assess damages:  amended claims could take longer to pay.<P>

<P>  INSURANCE FOR YOUR HOUSE AND PERSONAL POSSESSIONS:  DECIDING HOW</P>
<P>  MUCH YOU NEED</P>
<P>  If your house burns down or is destroyed by a violent windstorm,</P>
<P>  or if your possessions are stolen, you don't want to suddenly</P>
<P>  find out that your homeowners insurance policy pays less than you</P>
<P>  thought it would.</P>
<P>  The information in this brochure may help you avoid such</P>
<P>  unpleasant surprises if you file a claim.</P>
<P>  Here's what you can do to avoid being underinsured.</P>
<P>  1.  Find out how much it would cost to rebuild your home.  The</P>
<P>  amount of insurance you buy should be based on rebuilding costs,</P>
<P>  not the price of your home.  The cost of rebuilding your house</P>
<P>  may be higher (or lower) than the price you paid for it or the</P>
<P>  price you could sell it for today.</P>
<P>  Your insurance agent or company representative generally can</P>
<P>  calculate rebuilding costs for you or you can hire an appraiser</P>
<P>  to do the job.  Your local real estate agent will be able to give</P>
<P>  you the names of appraisers.</P>
<P>  The cost of rebuilding your house is based on local construction</P>
<P>  costs and the kind of house you have, including the type of</P>
<P>  exterior wall construction -- frame, masonry (brick or stone) or</P>
<P>  veneer; the square footage of the structure; the style -- ranch</P>
<P>  or colonial, for example; the number of bathrooms and other</P>
<P>  rooms; the type of roof and the materials used; and whether it</P>
<P>  was custom built.  Other things that affect the rebuilding cost</P>
<P>  are an attached garage, a fireplace, exterior trim and a home's</P>
<P>  special features, like arched windows.</P>
<P>  A good way to get a ballpark estimate of the cost of rebuilding</P>
<P>  your house is to calculate the square footage and multiply it by</P>
<P>  local building costs per square foot for your type of house.  For</P>
<P>  example, suppose your home is 2,000 square feet (1,200 square</P>
<P>  feet on the ground floor and 800 on the second floor) and that</P>
<P>  building costs in your community and for your type of house are</P>
<P>  $80 per square foot.  The cost to replace your home would be</P>
<P>  approximately $160,000.  You can ask a real estate agent or</P>
<P>  appraiser for average building costs in your area.</P>
<P>  2.  If you already have homeowners insurance, make sure you have</P>
<P>  enough.  Most insurance companies recommend you insure your home</P>
<P>  for 100 percent of the cost of rebuilding it.</P>
<P>  Few homes are totally destroyed but yours could be one of those</P>
<P>  few.  If it's insured for less than 100 percent of the rebuilding</P>
<P>  cost, you run the risk of not having enough money to replace it</P>
<P>  with one of similar size and quality.</P>
<P>  Make sure your agent knows about any improvements or additions to</P>
<P>  your house since you last talked about your insurance policy.  If</P>
<P>  you don't increase your limits to cover the cost of rebuilding</P>
<P>  the new deck, a second bathroom, a larger kitchen or other</P>
<P>  improvements that have increased the value of your home, you may</P>
<P>  save a little money on your insurance premium but you risk being</P>
<P>  underinsured.  Depending on the kind of policy you have, if you</P>
<P>  don't have sufficient insurance, your insurance company may only</P>
<P>  pay a portion of the cost of replacing or repairing damaged</P>
<P>  items.</P>
<P>  Look at your policy to see the maximum amount your insurance</P>
<P>  company would pay if your house was damaged and had to be</P>
<P>  rebuilt.  The limits of the policy typically appear on the</P>
<P>  Declarations Page under Section I Coverages, A. Dwelling.  Your</P>
<P>  insurance company will pay up to this amount to rebuild your</P>
<P>  home.</P>
<P>  Some banks require you to buy homeowners insurance to cover the</P>
<P>  amount of your mortgage.   If the limit of your insurance policy</P>
<P>  is based on your mortgage, make sure it's enough to cover the</P>
<P>  cost of rebuilding.</P>
<P>  3.  Make certain that the value of your insurance policy is</P>
<P>  keeping up with increases in local building costs.  If the limits</P>
<P>  of your policy haven't changed since your bought your home, then</P>
<P>  you're probably underinsured.  Ask your insurance agent or</P>
<P>  company representative about adding an &quot;inflation guard clause&quot;.</P>
<P>  This automatically adjusts the dwelling limit when you renew your</P>
<P>  policy to reflect current construction costs in your area.</P>
<P>  4.  Find out whether you have a &quot;replacement cost&quot; policy for the</P>
<P>  dwelling.  Most policies these days cover replacement cost for</P>
<P>  structural damage, but it's wise to check with your insurance</P>
<P>  agent or company representative.  A replacement cost policy will</P>
<P>  pay for the repair or replacement of damaged property with</P>
<P>  materials of similar kind and quality.  The insurance company</P>
<P>  won't deduct for depreciation -- the decrease in value due to</P>
<P>  age, wear and tear, and other factors.</P>
<P>  If you own an older home, you may not be able to buy a</P>
<P>  replacement cost policy.  Instead, you may have a modified</P>
<P>  replacement cost policy.  This means that instead of repairing or</P>
<P>  replacing features typical of older homes, like plaster walls and</P>
<P>  wooden floors, with similar materials, the policy will pay for</P>
<P>  repairs using the standard building materials and construction</P>
<P>  techniques in use today.</P>
<P>  Insurance companies differ greatly in how they insure older</P>
<P>  homes.  Some won't insure older homes for 100 percent of</P>
<P>  replacement cost because of the expense of re-creating special</P>
<P>  features like wall and ceiling moldings and carvings.  Other</P>
<P>  companies will insure older homes for 100 percent of replacement</P>
<P>  cost as long as the dwelling is in good condition.</P>
<P>  If you can't insure your home for 100 percent of replacement cost</P>
<P>  or choose not to do so -- in some cases, the cost of replacing a</P>
<P>  large old home is so high that you might not want to replace it</P>
<P>  with a house of the same size -- make sure the limits of the</P>
<P>  policy are high enough to provide you with a house of acceptable</P>
<P>  size and quality.</P>
<P>  5.  Find out whether building codes in your community have</P>
<P>  changed significantly since your home was built.  Building codes</P>
<P>  require structures to be built to minimum standards.  If your</P>
<P>  home were severely damaged, you might have to rebuild it to</P>
<P>  comply with the new standards.  In some cases, complying with the</P>
<P>  code may require a change in design or building materials and may</P>
<P>  cost more.  Generally, homeowners insurance policies won't pay</P>
<P>  for the extra expense but some insurance companies offer an</P>
<P>  endorsement that pays a specified amount toward these costs.  (An</P>
<P>  endorsement is a form attached to an insurance policy that</P>
<P>  changes what the policy covers.)</P>
<P>  6.  Consider buying a guaranteed replacement cost policy.  A</P>
<P>  guaranteed replacement cost policy will pay whatever it costs to</P>
<P>  rebuild your home as it was before the fire or other disaster,</P>
<P>  even if it exceeds the policy limit.  This gives you protection</P>
<P>  against sudden increases in construction costs due to a shortage</P>
<P>  of building materials, for example, or other unexpected</P>
<P>  situations but it generally doesn't cover the cost of upgrading</P>
<P>  the house to comply with building codes.  A guaranteed</P>
<P>  replacement cost policy may not be available if you own an older</P>
<P>  home.</P>
<P>  7.  Find out from your local government office whether your home</P>
<P>  is likely to be flooded.  If it is, contact your insurance agent</P>
<P>  or the Federal Insurance Administration at (202) 646-4623 and ask</P>
<P>  about the National Flood Insurance Program.  Remember, your</P>
<P>  homeowners insurance policy does not cover flood damage.  If you</P>
<P>  buy a federal government flood insurance policy, consider</P>
<P>  insuring your home for 100 percent of replacement cost and buying</P>
<P>  insurance to cover the contents of your home as well as the</P>
<P>  dwelling.</P>
<P>  8.  Make a list of all your personal possessions -- everything</P>
<P>  you and your household own in your home and in other buildings on</P>
<P>  the property, except your car which must be insured separately.</P>
<P>  Among the things you should include are indoor and outdoor</P>
<P>  furniture; appliances, stereos, computers and other electronic</P>
<P>  equipment; hobby materials and recreational equipment; china,</P>
<P>  linens, silverware and kitchen equipment; and jewelry, clothing</P>
<P>  and other personal belongings.</P>
<P>  9.  Estimate the value of your personal possessions at current</P>
<P>  prices.  The total is the amount of insurance you would need to</P>
<P>  replace the contents of your home with new items if everything</P>
<P>  were destroyed.</P>
<P>  10.  If you already have a homeowners insurance policy, find out</P>
<P>  how much insurance you have for the contents of your home.  The</P>
<P>  limit of the policy is shown on the Declarations Page under</P>
<P>  Section I, Coverages, Personal Property.  The contents limit</P>
<P>  generally is 50 percent of the amount of insurance on the</P>
<P>  dwelling but may be as high as 75 percent.  On a home insured for</P>
<P>  $100,000, for example, the contents limit would be $50,000 (50</P>
<P>  percent) or $75,000 (75 percent).  Now compare the contents limit</P>
<P>  with the total value of the items on your list of personal</P>
<P>  possessions.  If you think you're underinsured, discuss this</P>
<P>  problem with your insurance agent or insurance company</P>
<P>  representative.</P>
<P>  11.  There are two ways of insuring your personal possessions.</P>
<P>  If you have a homeowners insurance policy, find out whether claim</P>
<P>  payments for damage to your personal property would be based on</P>
<P>  replacement cost or actual cash value.  Check your policy under</P>
<P>  Section I, Conditions, Loss Settlement or ask your agent.  (If</P>
<P>  your are in the process of buying insurance, consider a</P>
<P>  replacement cost policy.)  As with insurance for the structure, a</P>
<P>  replacement cost policy pays the dollar amount needed to replace</P>
<P>  a damaged item with one of similar kind and quality without</P>
<P>  deductions for depreciation.  An actual cash value policy pays</P>
<P>  the amount needed to replace the item, minus depreciation.</P>
<P>  Suppose, for example, a tree fell through the roof onto your</P>
<P>  eight-year-old washing machine.  If you had a replacement cost</P>
<P>  policy for the contents of your home, the insurance company would</P>
<P>  pay to replace the old machine with a new one.  If you had an</P>
<P>  actual cash value policy, the company would pay only a percentage</P>
<P>  of the cost of a new washing machine because a machine that has</P>
<P>  been used for eight years would be worth less than its original</P>
<P>  cost.  That means that you would have to either buy a used</P>
<P>  machine or pay the difference between the amount your insurance</P>
<P>  company paid you and the cost of a new machine.</P>
<P>  12.  Check the limits on certain kinds of personal possessions,</P>
<P>  such as jewelry, silverware and furs.  This information is in</P>
<P>  Section I, Personal Property, Special Limits of Liability.  Some</P>
<P>  insurance companies also place a limit on what they'll pay for</P>
<P>  computers.  If the limits are too low, consider buying a special</P>
<P>  personal property &quot;endorsement&quot; or &quot;floater.&quot;  An endorsement is</P>
<P>  an addition to your policy.  A floater is a form of insurance</P>
<P>  that allows you to insure valuable items separately.  Under a</P>
<P>  floater, you'll be able to insure these items for higher amounts</P>
<P>  than you can under a standard homeowners policy.</P>
<P>  13.  Now that you have a list of your personal possessions, keep</P>
<P>  the list up to date.  If you have a claim, the more information</P>
<P>  you have about the damaged items -- a description of each and the</P>
<P>  date of purchase and purchase price -- the faster the claim can</P>
<P>  usually be settled.  Take photographs of furniture, write down</P>
<P>  the brand names and model numbers of appliances and electronic</P>
<P>  equipment, and note where and when you bought each item and the</P>
<P>  price.  Keep receipts with the list.  Store the list, photos and</P>
<P>  other records somewhere safe off the premises -- in a bank</P>
<P>  deposit box or with a neighbor or relative -- so that it isn't</P>
<P>  destroyed if your home is damaged.</P>
<P>  14.  Be a wise consumer.  Use the information in this brochure to</P>
<P>  find out how much insurance you need to avoid being underinsured.</P>
<P>  Ask your insurance agent or company representative questions</P>
<P>  about your policy.  Ask your agent to explain what factors were</P>
<P>  used to calculate the policy limits for the dwelling.  If you</P>
<P>  don't understand the answers the first time, ask again.  Check</P>
<P>  with friends.  If you still have a problem, call NICH (National</P>
<P>  Insurance Consumer Hotline) at 1-800-942-4242.</P>

<CENTER><H2> Don't Postpone Tomorrow:<BR> Review Your Retirement Plan Today </H2></CENTER><P><STRONG>DENVER -</STRONG> With longer life expectancies and significant changes in the corporate landscape and employment patterns, many Americans may be unpleasantly surprised when they reach their Golden Years.  Today, it is more important than ever for employees to know the details of their retirement plans and make any necessary adjustments in their financial situation before they receive their gold watches.<P>"Many of us need to face reality and monitor our retirement plans far more closely than those who had 30-year careers with the same employer," says Jan Walsh, MBA, CFP, an authority on retirement planning and an academic associate at the National Endowment for Financial Education.  Because we are looking at more years of work with a greater variety of employers, it is crucial to take responsibility of understanding how our employer's plan works - and how it affects our overall financial picture."<P>In learning about your company's retirement plan, first determine its type.  Two of the most common type of plans are the defined-benefit plan and the defined-contribution plan.<P>Defined-benefit plans traditionally have been the primary plans offered by most employers.  Under this type of plan, the company pays a stated amount of benefit, such as two percent of compensation for each year of service, and bears all of the investment risk.  Payments from defined-benefit plans are insured by the Pension Benefits Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), up to the monthly maximum - currently $2,559.<P>Recently, defined-contribution plans have grown in popularity as the primary plan for smaller and mid-sized companies, as well as supplemental plans for many larger employers.  In these plans, the company - and often the employee - makes annual contributions to such plans as 401(k), 403(b), profit sharing, money purchase, thrift, savings or employee stock ownership plans.  The contribution going into the plan is generally a given percentage of the employee's compensation.<P>"What is significantly different in defined-contribution plans," says Walsh, "is that the risk is shouldered by the employees.  They often choose the investments for their retirement plan nest eggs.  Just how well these investments perform determines the ultimate retirement benefit.  That's why it's so important to look at your assets as a whole when selecting investments.  Make sure that your total portfolio meets your need for liquidity and potential returns.  The mix depends on your overall goals, tolerance for risk and proximity to retirement age."<P>Types of contributions also vary with the type of plan.  In some, only the employer makes payments;  in others, only the employee contributes;  and in may, the company matches the amount contributed by the employee.  In the case of 401(k) or 403(b) plans, employee contributions are in pretax dollars.  In addition, if the company matches an employee's contributions, the worker makes a 50-percent gain on his or her contribution immediately.<P>"It's important, too, to know the basis of your company's contribution," says Walsh. "Is the 20 percent contribution determined by salary only, or does it also include overtime?"<P>Walsh advises learning who determines the choice of investment options in the plan, and who manages the actual investments.  This "manager" may be a committee of employees, a financial consultant, and investment firm or even the company's principal.<P>Also monitor your plan and its progress.  Walsh recommends checking to make sure the contributions your company promises appear correctly on statements and are directed to the fund or savings vehicles you selected.<P>Other areas to note include:<UL><LI><STRONG>Vesting. </STRONG>  Find out how many years it takes before you are 100 percent "vested", which is the percentage of accrued benefits you are entitled to, and the age you're eligible to receive the full amount of your plan benefits.<LI><STRONG>Social Security benefits. </STRONG>  If your plan is one that integrates Social Security benefits into the benefit formula, look into how this will impact you.<LI><STRONG>Distribution options. </STRONG>  Plans usually many methods of distribution, including lump-sum payments and joint and 50-percent survivor annuity payments.<LI><STRONG>Disability options. </STRONG>  Remember to factor in your company's disability retirement benefit when you assess your full financial plan.<LI><STRONG>Low-cost loans. </STRONG>  Loan provisions within many plans offer flexibility and the ability to borrow at low cost.  However, with low interest rates available elsewhere, compare interest rates before you borrow from your retirement moneys.<BR><P>"The benefits from your retirement plan may not be readily apparent until you look at all the details or meet with a professional financial planner to discuss the plan in full," says Walsh.  "Reviewing your plan's provisions and benefits is critical to look at what you'll need to accomplish outside of your company's program to create a financially sound retirement."<BR><P><HR><P>The National Endowment for Financial Education is an advocate of standards for all financial advisors.  This independent, non-profit institution supports an objective of helping Americans achieve financial well-being by offering education to professionals throughout the financial services industry and consumers.<P><FONT SIZE=2>[Copyright April 1994,National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE)</A>, all rights reserved.]</FONT></BODY><P>

<H4>SET SAIL SAFELY -- INSURANCE BASICS FOR BOATERS</H4><P>Before you set sail, you should practice safety on the waterways as inexperienced and irresponsible boaters can cause accidents, injury and even death. In fact, it is estimated that more than 90 percent of people in North America who drown were occupants of small boats.<P>Boating accidents stem from a number of factors including traveling too fast for water or weather conditions, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, failing to follow boating rules and regulations, carelessness and inexperience.<P>To prevent boating accidents, the Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS) offers these suggestions: <P><UL><LI>Check your boat and surroundings.<LI>Before setting out, check weather forecasts and water conditions. Notify friends or relatives of where you are going and when you expect to return.<LI>Check engine, fuel, electrical and steering systems, especially for exhaust system leaks.<LI>Carry one or more fire extinguishers, matched to the size and type of boat. Make sure they are in working condition.<LI>Equip the boat with a whistle, horn or bell and the required navigation lights. An anchor line and a bucket or pump for bailing water are also essential.<LI>Consider placing additional safety devices on your boat such as paddle or oars, first-aid kit, supply of fresh water, tool kit and spare parts, flashlight, flares and radio. If you are traveling far offshore, consider stocking your boat with a VHF radio, depth finder, survival suit and gear, life raft and Emergency Position <LI>Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB).<LI>Check your crew and any guests.<LI>Make sure that every person on board wears a life jacket.<LI>Learn and obey marine traffic laws. Make sure you are aware of any changes in state/local regulations.<LI>Learn various distress signals. You should also carry a 12-inch x 12-inch international orange distress flag and smoke signals. If you are boating at night, carry flares or an SOS light.<LI>Be alert for other watercraft, swimmers, floating debris and shallow waters.<LI>Be careful when you load the boat. Don't overload -- distribute the load evenly. Don't stand up or shift weight suddenly in a small boat. Don't permit riding on the bow, seatbacks or gunwales. </UL><P><H4>MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ADEQUATE INSURANCE</H4>It's important to check if you have enough insurance to cover injuries, theft or damages to your boat. Your homeowners policy only provides limited coverage -- $1,000 or 10% of property coverage -- for theft and physical damages to your boat, its equipment, accessories, outboard motor or trailer. In addition, your homeowners policy may not extend to your boating activities depending on the size of your boat and the type of engine.<P>Ask your agent about an "endorsement" to your homeowners policy or a "package" policy to cover your vessel. An endorsement is a written form attached to the policy that alters its coverage, terms or conditions to fit your boating insurance needs. Package policies include property damage, medical bills and any liability to others. (Note: Package policies vary from company to company so check with an experienced marine insurance agent or representative to ensure you have enough coverage.)  Also consider purchasing additional coverage for damage to the hull and for accidents with uninsured boaters.<P>If you own a large boat, consider purchasing a yacht policy to protect against damage to the boat (including the hull). You may also need to buy extra liability protection.<P>Ask your insurance agent or company about any available discounts. Some insurance companies give discounts (5 to 15 percent) to boaters who have attended a recognized safety education course, such as those offered by the Coast Guard, U.S. Power Squadrons, American Red Cross and others.<P>Discounts (5 to 10 percent) are also available for diesel powered boats equipped with safety equipment such as a fire extinguisher and ship-to-shore radios. You may also get discounts if you have not filed a claim for two years and if you buy all you insurance with the same insurer.<P><H4>FOR ADDITIONAL BOATING SAFETY TIPS...</H4>The U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary offers boating safety courses. Upon request, the auxiliary will conduct a Courtesy Marine Examination (CME) on your boat, checking electrical and safety equipment and fuel hoses.<P> Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues. For more information on how to arrange for a speaker, please contact us at (800) 397-1679.<P>

<H4>PROTECTING  HIGH-DOLLAR PERSONAL POSSESSIONS</H4> Your great-grandma's heirloom silverware. Your son's prized baseball card collection. The anniversary ring you could finally afford to buy.  Your cherished possessions are among the things you want most to protect. Ironically, they're also the very items that are probably not completely covered by your homeowner's insurance.<P>Take a minute to review your homeowner's policy. Many valuable personal possessions are only covered for $200 to $2,500.  These special items have limited coverages because their values vary and are somewhat arbitrary. You may need additional insurance to make sure they're covered for their full value.<P>Here what to expect in a standard homeowner's policy:<P><TABLE><BORDER=0ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD><UL><LI>Money, gold, silver and platinum<BR>(other than jewelry or flatware),<BR>coins, bank notes and medals</UL></TD><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN=MIDDLE>$200</TD></TR><TR><TD><UL><LI>Securities, deeds, manuscripts,<BR>tickets, stamps and valuable financial papers<BR>like letters of credit or evidence of debt</UL></TD><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN=MIDDLE>$1,000</TD></TR><TR><TD><UL><LI>Watercraft, including their<BR>trailers, furnishings, equipment and<BR>outboard motors</UL></TD><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN=MIDDLE>$1,000</TD></TR><TR><TD><UL><LI>Trailers not used with watercraft</UL></TD><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</TD><TD>$1,000</TD></TR><TR><TD><UL><LI>Grave markers</UL></TD><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</TD><TD>$1,000</TD></TR><TR><TD><UL><LI>Jewelry, watches, furs and precious<BR>and semi-precious stones</UL></TD><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</TD><TD>$1,000 - $2,000</TD></TR><TR><TD><UL><LI>Silverware, goldware, silver-plated<BR>or gold-plated ware, and pewterware</UL></TD><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</TD><TD>$2,500</TD></TR><TR><TD><UL><LI>Firearms</UL></TD><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</TD><TD>$2,500</TD></TR></TABLE><P>Some policies also provide limited coverage for works of art, antiques, musical instruments, cameras, sports equipment and oriental rugs. If you own an item that doesn't seem to fit any of the categories above, ask your agent or company representative how much it's covered for in your policy.<P>You can purchase additional insurance, called a floater or endorsement, to cover your valuable personal property. A floater is an all-risk policy -- unlike your homeowner's insurance which typically covers only those specific perils that are named in the policy, an all-risk  policy covers against everything except what is specifically excluded in the policy.<P>For example, your homeowner's policy covers your diamond ring (up to a specified dollar amount) against theft because theft is a peril named in your policy.  But if the diamond drops out of its setting and falls down the sink while you're peeling potatoes, the loss won't be covered unless you have additional insurance.<P>To make sure you'll be adequately compensated in the event of a loss, you must have your valuables competently appraised.  Go to a professional appraiser.  Look in the yellow pages for someone who belongs to the American Society of Appraisers and ask for a detailed description of each item and its assessed value.   If these items are ever stolen or destroyed in a fire, this information will help you get your claim paid quickly and fairly.<P>What if an appraiser puts only a small financial value on an item of great sentimental value? Unfortunately, insurance can't cover the heartache of losing special belonging and you'll only be able to insure it for it's monetary worth.  Also, remember some items depreciate.  A new mink coat may be insured for it's ticket price, but after five years its worth will decrease.  To keep your premiums affordable, only insure your property for its current value, not for its value when you purchased it.<P>Floater coverage isn't expensive and is usually priced per $100 of insurance.  The cost of a floater depends on what you're covering and the frequency of loss in your area. Ask your agent if your premium might be lower by keeping some of your insured valuables in a bank safe deposit box.<P>Do you need additional insurance? Take inventory of your personal possessions. Compare their values to the coverages allowed by your homeowner's policy and talk to your agent about protecting your special items with a floater.<P>Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues.

*******************************<P>                               OOPS!!<P>                               BANG!<P>
  YOU take a lot of chances as a driver.</H2><P>
   You may be in an accident or have your car vandalized or  stolen.  Insurance is available to protect you from the potentially  huge costs associated with these risks.      <P> Replacing just the bumper on a typical American-made car can  cost over $300.  Medical bills resulting from an accident could add  hundreds, or even thousands of dollars more to the bill.      <P> Insurance companies generally prefer to sell their insurance  to good drivers and may decide not to insure high risk drivers.  Unfortunately, statistics show that one out of every three young  drivers will have an accident each year.  So, insurers do not think  of new drivers as "good" drivers.  This does not mean that you  cannot get insurance, however.      <P> There are several things about auto insurance that you should  know BEFORE you shop around
 <H2> COMMON QUESTIONS  ABOUT AUTO INSURANCE</H2>  <P>Q. What is insurance?<P>  A. Insurance is a way of spreading financial risk among large     numbers of people.  You pay a fee to an insurance company for the     right to share in funds set aside to pay your costs in certain pre-     defined circumstances.  <P>Q. Do I have to buy auto insurance?<P>  A. Most states require you to carry a minimum amount of liability     coverage.  Many states have "no-fault" auto insurance systems; in     other states, coverage for medical costs for you and your     passengers is optional.  Coverage for damage to your car is     optional.  <P>Q. How much will my insurance cost?<P>  A. Prices vary widely.  The type of car you drive, your driving     record, your age, your sex, where you live and how much you drive     usually affect cost.  You may qualify for various discounts.  <P>Q. Can I be added on to my parents' auto insurance?<P>  A. If you drive a family car, you can be added to your parents'     policy.  However, the cost of the policy will increase.  (Some     companies insure young drivers only on a family policy.)  If you     have your own car, your parents' company may sell you a separate     policy but at a different rate that your parents.  New drivers     seeking their own insurance frequently are referred to state-run     insurance pools, known as "assigned risk plans," where the cost of     insurance is higher.<P>  <H2>HOW DO YOU BUY AUTO INSURANCE?</H2>
  1. Shop around.  Many companies sell auto insurance.  Compare prices     -in some states, prices vary by up to 100%.  Ask agents, brokers or     insurance companies for price comparisons.  Some state insurance     departments publish guides showing what different companies charge     in certain situations in various parts of the state.<P>  2. See if you can lower your insurance rates.  Many companies offer     discounts on the piece of auto insurance to people who have passed     an approved driver education course or who have a B grade average     or better.  Take proof of driver education and/or good grades with     you when you shop for insurance.  Many companies also offer     discounts if a car has anti-theft devices or air bags.<P>  3. Investigate the types and amounts of coverage you need.  For     example, if your car is not worth much, you may not want to buy     collision coverage.<P>  4. Look for an insurance agent, broker or company representative     that you trust.  Ask friends or relatives, or consult the telephone     book.  Ask questions.<P>
  5. Read your policy.  As a contract, an insurance policy creates     several obligations for both you and the insurance company.  For     example, the company must defend you in court if you are sued under     the policy and you must give your insurer complete, accurate and     timely information about any accident or ticket.  Before you sign     anything, go over the policy and any confusing language with your     insurance representative and family.<P>  Q. Do I have to be a certain age to buy my own insurance?<P>  A. No.  However, you must have a valid driver's license.  Also, in     many states you must be 18 before you can own a car without an     adult's name on the auto registration.<P>  Q. How often do I have to renew my insurance?<P>
  A. Auto insurance policies usually last six months.  Some last one     year.  You will received a notice when it is time to renew your     insurance.<P>  Q. Will my rates go up or will I lose my insurance if I get into an     accident or get a ticket?<P>  A. If you are not at fault in an accident, your insurance should     not be affected.  If you are at fault, get a ticket for a serious     violation (such as drunk driving), or are involved in an expensive     property damage claim (such as crashing into a tree), the company     will consider that when setting the price for your next insurance     policy.  Your rates for the current policy won't be affected.<P>.<HR>

<H4>WHY RENTERS SHOULD BUY INSURANCE</H4>If you rent a home, condominium or apartment and don't have renters insurance, you're flirting with financial disaster. Without renters insurance, you have no protection for your valuables if they were stolen or damaged by fire or other disaster nor do you have protection against a damaging lawsuit if someone is injured on your property.<P>Approximately 54% of renters today have no insurance to protect their possessions from the disasters mentioned. Why? The reasons vary. For example, some renters believe that insurance is too expensive. Others think that they don't have anything valuable to insure. Some instantly assume that they're covered under their landlord's policy while others aren't aware that there is such a thing. These assumptions, however, are all wrong.<P>To understand why renters insurance is a wise investment, simply add up the total cost of everything you own including your television, stereo, video camera, computer, pots and pans, jewelry, collectibles, clothes, furniture, etc. This is how much money you would need to replace everything if they were stolen or damaged. If you can't afford to replace these items at a moment's notice, you should consider purchasing a renters insurance policy. Also, when you factor in the increase of crime nationwide, renters insurance seems more appealing. The idea that "it can't happen to me" is not a rational concept anymore because millions of people are victims of theft every year.<P>Don't count on your landlord's policy for protection of your possessions because it only covers the building. You're on your own when it comes to insurance. However, renters insurance will cover most of your personal possessions against fire/smoke, lightening, vandalism, theft, explosions and other disasters. It will also cover additional living expenses if you are forced to move from your home, apartment or condominium due to the aforementioned perils. Finally, it will provide liability coverage if someone is injured in your home. It also includes legal costs in the event that you are sued for this injury.<P>Unlike other personal property policies, renters insurance is relatively inexpensive, ranging from $65 to $225 a year depending on the type of coverage and where you live.<P>"It's cheaper because you're insuring only your possessions--not the building structure itself," says Gene Jeffers, executive director of the Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS).<P>To determine how much coverage you need, take an inventory of everything you own and add up the total value. This amount is how much insurance you will need. You should also include purchase dates and serial numbers, save receipts and take photographs. Some possessions such as jewelry and computers require additional coverage in the form of floaters. These items are often based on a per-category theft limit which means that your insurer will only pay a specified amount for the item if it is stolen.<P>For more information on renters insurance or how to take an inventory of your possessions, WIIS has available the following brochures: "Insurance Sense: Renters and Condominium Insurance," "Here Today, Gone Tomorrow! Who Needs Renters Insurance," "Tenants Insurance Basics" and "Taking Inventory."  To receive free copies of these brochures, please send a self-addressed, stamped envelope along with your request to Western Insurance Information Service, 3530 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1610, Los Angeles, CA 90010.<P>Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues. For more information or how to arrange for a speaker, please contact us at (800) 397-1679.<P>

<H4>KEEPING YOUR AUTO INSURANCE PREMIUMS LOW</H4>	Although auto insurance rates are based on a number of factors such as your age, marital status and driving record, you can still lower your insurance costs by doing some careful shopping.<BR>	According to the Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS), consumers can save hundreds of dollars a year if they follow these suggestions:<P><H4>TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AVAILABLE DISCOUNTS</H4>	Some insurers will offer discounts that can reduce your insurance premiums from 5% to 40%. Always ask your insurer about the types of discounts their company offers because you may be eligible for a discount that would not otherwise automatically be applied to your premium. Keep in mind that these discounts vary from company to company. Here is a list of some common discounts:<BR><UL><LI>Low mileage/Restricted mileage<BR><LI>Passive restraints (cars equipped with automatic seat belts or air bags)<BR><LI>Anti-lock brakes<BR><LI>Good driver discounts (no accidents or moving violations in the past three years. A 20% discount is mandatory in California) <BR><LI>Multi-car discounts (for insuring more than one car with the same company)<BR><LI>Loyalty discounts (insured with same company for a specified number of years) <BR><LI>Defensive training/driver training courses<BR><LI>Anti-theft devices (these include ignition and fuel cut-off systems, alarms, hood-and-wheel locking devices, and window identification systems) <BR><LI>Nonsmoker discounts<BR><LI>Drivers over age 50<BR><LI>Multiple policy discounts (Auto and homeowners coverage with the same company) <BR><LI>Car-pooler<BR><LI>College students away from home without a car<P></UL><H4>CHOOSE HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES</H4>	By raising the deductible on collision and comprehensive coverage, you can substantially lower your insurance premiums.<P><H4>CONSIDER THE TYPE OF CAR YOU MIGHT BUY</H4>	Before you buy a new or used car, you should check how much your insurance premiums may cost. Cars that have high theft rates, high frequency of claims or are expensive to repair will have high insurance rates. However, buying "low profile" cars such as mid-sized station wagons or four-door sedans and cars with safety features can save you a considerable amount of money.<P>	According to the Highway Data Loss Institute, some examples of cars with low theft claims are the Mercury Sable, Chevy Cavalier, and Mazda MPV Van. Cars with high theft rates include the Mercedes, Chevrolet and Ford convertibles, and the Volkswagen Cabriolet or Golf/GTI.<P><H4>SELECT ONLY THE TYPES OF COVERAGES YOU NEED</H4>	There are six basic types of coverage: 1) Bodily Injury Liability Insurance, 2) Medical Payments Insurance, 3) Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Protection, 4) Property Damage Liability, 5)Comprehensive Physical Damage Insurance and 6) Collision Insurance.<P> 	You should review each type of coverage carefully as each one applies to  different types of losses. You can easily waste money by duplicating coverages. For example, if you already have good medical and disability insurance, you may not want to buy medical payments insurance. Also, if you have collision and comprehensive insurance, you don't need to buy the type of uninsured motorist protection that pays for damages to your vehicle.<P>	You can also save money by dropping collision/and or comprehensive coverages on older cars worth less than $1,000. If you make a claim, you would not substantially exceed annual cost and deductible amounts.<P><H4>COMPARE RATES FROM OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES</H4>	Since auto insurance rates can vary by hundreds of dollars, you should do some careful shopping. Keep in mind that when you compare prices, premiums are based upon the same types of coverages and information being quoted.<P>	While price is an important factor, you should also consider the quality of service the insurer will provide. Check the insurance company's claims paying history and financial strength to ensure that the company is reliable. You can call the Department of Insurance in your state to check if a company is licensed to sell insurance there. <P>	If you would like additional information on auto insurance, WIIS has available the following brochures: "Nine Ways to Lower Your Auto Insurance Costs" and "Insurance for the Car."  Please send a self-addressed stamped business envelope (64 cents) to WIIS, 3530 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1610, Los Angeles, CA 90010.<P>	Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues.

<H4>ALCOHOL-RELATED CRASHES DON'T HAVE TO DAMPEN HOLIDAY SEASON</H4>Holidays, parties and alcohol -- they all seem to go together, don't they?  That may be why in December last year, 35 percent of all fatally injured drivers of passenger vehicles had a blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent or higher.  That's above the legal limit in all states.<P>Never drink and drive, and never get into a vehicle when the driver has been drinking.<P>Western Insurance Information Service offers the following facts to help you decide not to drink and drive this holiday season:<UL><LI>In the U.S., there is an alcohol-related traffic fatality every 32 minutes and an alcohol-related traffic injury every two minutes.<LI>Two out of every five Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related crash during their lifetimes.<LI>Traffic crashes involving males are much more likely than those involving females to be alcohol-related.<LI>Alcohol involvement in traffic crashes is highest for men age 31-40.<LI>While alcohol-related traffic crashes occur at all hours, they peak at night and happen more often on weekends.  In 1994, more drivers with a blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent or higher were killed on a Saturday between midnight and 3 a.m. than any other time.<LI>Even with a blood alcohol content as low as 0.02 percent, alcohol affects driving ability and crash likelihood.  The probability of a crash begins to increase significantly at 0.05 percent and climbs rapidly after about 0.08 percent.  Among drivers with a blood alcohol content above 0.15 percent on weekend nights, the likelihood of death in a single-vehicle crash is more than 380 times higher than it is for nondrinking drivers.<LI>Contrary to popular belief, 87 percent of drivers with a high blood alcohol content in fatal crashes have no alcohol convictions during the previous three years.<LI>Of drivers killed in roadside hazard crashes (hitting a tree, sign, wall, etc.) in 1994, 49 percent had a blood alcohol content of more than 0.10 percent.<LI>Forty-seven percent of all motorcycle drivers killed in single-vehicle crashes in 1994 had a blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent or higher.<LI>Of pedestrians 16 years and older killed in nighttime crashes in 1994, 51 percent had a blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent or higher.<LI>Being at fault in an alcohol-related traffic crash will cause an increase in your auto insurance premium.</UL><P>Looking for ways to lower your auto insurance costs?  Western Insurance Information Service provides a helpful brochure free of charge. To request your free copy of "Nine Ways to Lower Your Auto Insurance Costs," please write to Western Insurance Information Service, 6565 S. Dayton St., Suite 2400, Englewood, CO 80111.

<H2>Season's Greenings: Tips To Keep Wallets Jolly</H2><P>'Tis the season to "deck the malls" with your greenery orplastic&#151;your heart full of goodwill and wallet a bit lowon cash. But make sure that you don't meet with shoppingfolly.</P><P>"It is easy to make impulse purchases, thinking only ofthose you are buying for and how happy the recipient willbe," said Donald Johnson, MBA, CFP, senior academic at theCollege for Financial Planning&#174;. "Developing a budgetand a gifting plan can be critical for those living on afixed income or experiencing a reduction in their earningpower, and it's a good idea for any gift giver, as well."</P><P>Johnson provides the following tips to help you stick toyour budget, and some gift ideas to make your dollarscount.</P><P>Assess your funds and budget. Identify the amount youhave readily available for presents now and how much you'llhave for the next few months to pay off any charges withoutstraining your budget. Determine a spending ceiling based onthese amounts and stick to it.</P><P>Make a list. Divide your overall gift-giving budget intolimits for each person on your shopping list. Then, withinthat amount, identify which presents can be purchased inorder of priority for each individual.</P><P>Research purchases and start early. Watch for advertisedspecials and compare prices, features, and quality before youhead for the mall. Leave enough shopping time to avoid alimited selection of items, high-pressure sales, or impulsebuys.</P><P>Investigate return policies. Ask about the store's returnpolicy before buying. Make sure the merchant accepts returns,exchanges, and/or refunds for all items, even those onsale.</P><P>Record purchases and keep sales receipts. Carry anotecard or paper with you to record the cost of each itemand whether the sale was cash or credit. Keep a running totalof your purchases, and check it frequently to ensure that youare adhering to your budget. This constant tally is helpfulin resisting the temptation to overspend, especially whenusing credit cards. Mark sales receipts&#151;noting the itemand method of purchase&#151;and retain them for potentialreturns.</P><P>Consider nontraditional gifts. You may want to avoid themall crawl altogether and give your child or grandchildsomething that has lasting value through a custodial account.Depending on your budget, you can choose from the followingitems, which range from approximately $25 to $1,000 each.</P><P>Some shares of stock in Disney&#174;, McDonald's &#174;,Toys "R" Us&#174;, or a company that owns a sports team hasthe advantage of teaching youngsters the value of having astake in a business venture that is familiar to them.</P><P>A gift of U.S. Government EE bonds allows a child to"loan" money to the country he or she lives in. Common stockmutual funds may impress the power of compounding returnsupon young minds.</P><P>Collectibles&#151;such as American Eagle gold or silverproof coins, rare coins, or stamps&#151;serve as tangiblegifts that can grow in value. Or, the recipient may have avaluable collection of vintage records, baseball cards, orcomic books that you can contribute to if you know what toadd.</P><P>You might open an IRA account for an older youth who isearning income. If, when the child is 16, you contribute$1,000 to an IRA earning 10 percent annually&#151;a returnthat over time is attainable with a good common stock mutualfund&#151;that amount can grow to be worth more than $100,000by the time he or she reaches age 65.</P><P>Finally, for those of any age, a gift to help them betterplan their finances or investments is often welcome. A goodbook or video on financial planning or an inexpensivecommunity college course on money management might meet theneeds of friends or family members on your gift list. Openinga college education account for a child might make him or hermore aware of the need to save for the years ahead. </P><P>"These tips can help you identify your immediate giftingand financial resources&#151;and limitations&#151;thisseason," said Johnson. "After the presents have been wrappedand holiday giving is still on your mind, you may want tobegin planning for 1996. It's a good time to consider nextyear's gifting goals and needs, along with the rest of yourfinancial objectives."</P><P>The National Endowment for Financial Education&#174;(NEFE&#174;) is an independent, nonprofit institution thatadvocates standards for all financial advisors and isdedicated to a goal of helping Americans achieve financialwell-being.

<h2>PRESS RELEASE</h2>
<p>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<p>
<center><h4>Management and KKR Agree to Purchase Talegen Operations</h4></center>
<p>
SEATTLE, Wash., January 18, 1996 --- Talegen Holdings, Inc. (Talegen) today announced agreements for an investment group, comprised of senior managers of the Talegen holding company and its Operating Companies, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR), to acquire the Talegen operations from Xerox Corporation. The management buy-out is structured into two separate transactions totaling approximately $2.7 billion.  Talegen is a wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox Financial Services, Inc.
<p>
One transaction involves Talegen Holdings, Inc. and the four insurance operating groups actively involved in the commercial property/casualty market (Coregis, Crum & Forster Insurance, Industrial Indemnity and Westchester Specialty Group), as well as Talegen's information technology and payroll/benefits services companies.  The other transaction involves The Resolution Group (TRG), which specializes in managing claims, reinsurance recoverable and other exposures of run-off books of business, and Talegen's environmental claims management services company. 
<p>
The separate transactions for Talegen and TRG are to faciliate financing arrangements only and will have no effect on day-to-day operations.  Joseph (Jay) W. Brown, Jr. will remain chairman of both Talegen and TRG following the transactions, and each Operating Company will continue to operate as a separate business entity with its defined mission, strategy and existing management team.
<p>
Commenting on the transaction, Jay Brown said, "Xerox has been a strong and supportive parent of the Talegen organization. With their approval, our senior management team has worked closely with KKR in structuring these acquisitions, and we're extremely pleased to be joining with an investment partner of their caliber.  More importantly, with the Xerox disengagement process now coming to a close, we can focus all our energies on being the best at what we do, in every business segment in which we compete - an endlessly challenging and rewarding quest we are eager to continue."
<p>
"We're delighted to have the opportunity to join forces with Jay Brown and his outstanding  management team in pursuing exciting growth opportunities in the company's insurance operations," said KKR partner Saul Fox. "We've known Jay for several years and our goal will be to support him and his team as they continue to build on a successful track record.  This transaction also reinforces our long-term enthusiam for the insurance industry, marking our third insurance investment to date."
<p>
With these transactions and the prior sales of certain niche businesses, Talegen has succeeded in returning a total of approximately $3.3 billion in value to Xerox and has found a strong partner to complete its mission of replacing Xerox's investment.
<p>
Stuart B. Ross, chairman of Xerox Financial Services, observed, "In the past four years, Jay and his fellow managers have been able to complete a major restructuring of the organization and achieve significant operational improvements, while at the same time replacing Xerox ownership. It's been a pleasure to work with such a capable group of people, and I have every confidence they will continue their pace of accomplishments under the new ownership structure."
<p>
The transactions are expected to close in mid-1996 once financing and regulatory approvals have been finalized.

<HEAD><TITLE>Insurance Corner - Choosing a Long-Term Care Policy - Source:National Endowment For Financial Education</TITLE></HEAD>

<CENTER><H2> Choosing a Long-Term Care Policy<BR>That's Right For You </H2></CENTER><P><STRONG>DENVER -</STRONG> Would a long stay in a nursing home wipe out your life savings?  People living longer, tougher qualification rules for Medicaid, smaller families, and rising health care costs have increased the need for long-term care (LTC) insurance to help pay for extended nursing home or home health care.  But who really needs such a policy and what benefit features should they choose?<P>A year of nursing home care costs individuals an average of $40,000 a year in this country.  The wealthy generally can afford to meet that expense out of pocket.  People at the other end of the economic scale generally can't afford the LTC insurance premiums and probably would qualify for Medicaid, anyway.<P>"People who have more modest assets, modest retirement income, especially those who have little or no family to provide care at home, and who don't want to rely on government programs are the ones who should consider purchasing long-term care insurance," says Kathryn Ioannides, JD, CFP, CLU, ChFC, the assistant director of academic programs and courses at the National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE).<P>Ioannides recommends that people begin considering LTC insurance in their 50s, even if they don't buy it until they're in their 60s (premiums rise dramatically after that).  The first step is to determine need.  To do this, an individual might find out the average cost of local nursing home care and then, with the help of a financial professional, determine what portion he or she could afford to pay annually out of assets and income and what portion would have to be covered by LTC insurance.  If nursing home care runs $100 a day and the person can pay $35 of that, the policy might need to carry a daily benefit of $65.<P>The next challenge lies in choosing the right policy and features.  "Long-term care coverage is expensive and there are many options from which to choose," says Ioannides.  She strongly recommends considering the following three important benefit features:<UL><LI><STRONG>Cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). </STRONG>  A COLA bumps up the chosen daily benefit each year, usually at a fixed percentage, to keep up with rising health care costs.  A $100 daily benefit today, with a 5 percent annually compounded COLA would provide $550 in daily benefits in 35 years.  While this feature would be more important to someone who buys a policy at age 60 than it would at age 70, Ioannides points out that since many people are living into their 90s.<LI><STRONG>Home health care.</STRONG>"This is an important feature because living at home is preferred by many of the elderly," says Ioannides.  A home health care benefit is generally sold as a specified percentage of daily nursing home home benefit, such as 50 percent or 100 percent.  "Typically, 100 percent is the best choice," says Ioannides, "because home health care, contrary to public perception, is not cheaper than nursing home care.  Skilled care by a nurse or therapist at home can easily run as much as a nursing home stay - plus the individual still has the continued home maintenance costs, such as taxes, utilities, food, and perhaps even a mortgage."<LI><STRONG>Liberal benefit triggers. </STRONG> Look for a policy that does not require previous hospitalization or skilled nursing home care before benefits will be paid.  The policy generally should go into effect if the policyholder is unable to perform one or more "activities of daily living," such as bathing, dressing, or eating.  And the policy should pay for all three levels of nursing home care: custodial, intermediate, and skilled.</UL><BR><P>One should also be sure that a policy's benefit triggers include forms of cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease.  (Ioannides notes that Alzheimer's, which can strike early in life, is an argument for getting LTC coverage earlier rather than later.)<P>Of course, each feature you choose adds to a policy's cost, sometimes substantially.  The home health care and COLA features, for example, each can double the premium cost of a "no-frills" policy.  To reduce premium costs, Ioannides suggests several options:<UL><LI><I>You could lengthen the period of time after the onset of need but before a policy begins to pay benefits (the elimination period).  This means you pay expenses out of pocket for the first 30, 90, or 180 days of care.</I><LI><I>You could buy a policy for a shorter period of coverage, such as two to five years, rather than for a lifetime.  However, this would not dramtically lessen premiums because statistics show most nursing home visits last fewer than three years.</I><LI><I>Couples might consider buying a joint LTC policy that covers both and has a lower premium than two individual policies.  At the very least, if a couple each purchases an LTC policy from the same company, they should inquire about discounts. Not all companies offer these features.</I><P>Finally, Ioannides recommends that people be aware that a change in their personal circumstances, such as divorce or death, could alter the need and type of policy.  They should also look for changes in the Medicaid laws that might affect their needs.<BR><P><HR><P>The National Endowment for Financial Education is an independent, nonprofit institution that advocates standards for all financial advisors and is dedicated to the goal of helping Americans achieve financial well-being.  Divisions within the NEFE structure include the <A HREF="/carriers/nefe/default.htm">College for Financial Planning</A>, the Institute for Tax Studies, the Institute for Wealth Management, the Institute for Retirement Planning, the NEFE Public Education Center, and NEFE Press.  The 23-year-old College for Financial Planning is accredited by the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA).<P>Programs offered by the College for Financial Planning include the Certified Financial Planner Professional Education Program, the Master of Science degree program, Advanced Studies courses, the Foundations in Financial Planning course, the Financial Paraplanner Program, and a broad range of professional development offerings.<P><FONT SIZE=2>[Copyright July 1995, National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE)</A>, all rights reserved.]</FONT></BODY><P>

<H4>PROTECT YOUR HOME FROM BURGLARS BEFORE YOU GO ON VACATION</H4> Each year one out of every 20 homes will be burglarized.  The FBI reported that 12 million property crimes occurred in 1992 costing Americans $3.8 billion.<P> According to Gene Jeffers, executive director for the Western Insurance Information Service, nine out of 10 household burglaries are preventable.  It's all in the preparation before you leave home.<P>So before you pile your luggage in the car or get your airline tickets ready for that long awaited vacation, make sure that once you leave, you won't return to an empty house.  WIIS suggests you follow these guidelines:<P><H4>DON'T GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT NO ONE IS AT HOME</H4><UL><LI>Suspend mail and newspaper deliveries or arrange to have these items picked up or forwarded to another address.<LI>Use automatic timers to turn lights on and off at appropriate times.  You may also consider connecting a radio to a timer.<LI>Arrange to have your lawn mowed.<LI>Leave blinds or curtains open in their usual position.<LI>Lower the sound of your phone so that its ring can't be heard outside.</UL><P><H4>MAKE YOUR HOME BURGLAR RESISTANT</H4><UL><LI>Secure doors with dead-bolts or double-cylinder locks instead of only doorknobs or spring activated locks which are easier to break into.  Dead-bolt locks should fit an inch and a half into door frames and are more effective when used with metal sockets that are more difficult to pry open than simple wood sockets.<LI>Place vertical bolts or a piece of wood (e.g. a broomstick) or metal rod in the tracks of sliding doors.<LI>Make sure all locks on windows are secure.  Windows can also be secured with key locks.</UL><H4>DON'T GIVE BURGLARS AN INCENTIVE TO BREAK INTO YOUR HOME</H4><UL><LI>Position all valuables such as paintings, antiques or silver collections away from windows.<LI>Don't leave extra keys around the mailbox, doormat or flower pots.<LI>Put cash, jewelry and other valuables in a bank safe deposit.</UL><H4>HAVE SOMEONE WATCH YOUR HOME</H4><UL><LI>Notify the police or a reliable neighbor that you will be gone and ask them to keep a watchful eye on your home.</UL><H4>CHECK YOUR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE</H4>Before you leave for vacation, you should check with your insurance agent to make sure you are adequately covered if your home is burglarized.  Also, you should make a list of all your personal belongings so that you will have a record of what was stolen or damaged.<P>After the holidays, be sure to include in your home inventory a list of all your newly acquired gifts such as new stereo equipment, a computer, VCR, jewelry, etc. Make sure your insurance policy includes the amount of your new items should they ever be stolen or damaged by fire. If you don't update your policy, you may run the risk of being underinsured.<P>For more information on home security or how to keep an inventory of your personal possessions, WIIS has available the following brochures: "Home Security Basics" and "Taking Inventory."  For a free brochure, please send a self-addressed, stamped business envelope to the Western Insurance Information Service, 3530 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1610, Los Angeles, CA 90010.<P>Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues.  For more information or how to arrange for a speaker, please contact us at (800) 397-1679.

*******************************<P> KEEPING YOUR AUTO INSURANCE PREMIUMS LOW<P>
 </H2>
 
	Although auto insurance rates are based on a number of factors such as your age, marital status and driving record, you can still lower your insurance costs by doing some careful shopping.<P>
	According to the Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS), consumers can save hundreds of dollars a year if they follow these suggestions:<P><H5>TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AVAILABLE DISCOUNTS</H5><P>
	Some insurers will offer discounts that can reduce your insurance premiums from 5% to 40%. Always ask your insurer about the types of discounts their company offers because you may be eligible for a discount that would not otherwise automatically be applied to your premium. Keep in mind that these discounts vary from company to company. Here is a list of some common discounts:<P><P>Low mileage/Restricted mileage<P>
Passive restraints (cars equipped with automatic seat belts or air bags)<P>
Anti-lock brakes<P>
Good driver discounts (no accidents or moving violations in the past three years. A 20% discount is mandatory in California) <p>Multi-car discounts (for insuring more than one car with the same company)<p>Loyalty discounts (insured with same company for a specified number of years) <p>Defensive training/driver training courses<>Anti-theft devices (these include ignition and fuel cut-off systems, alarms, hood-and-wheel locking devices, and window identification systems) <p>Nonsmoker discounts<p>Drivers over age 50<p>Multiple policy discounts (Auto and homeowners coverage with the same company) <p>Car-pooler<p>College students away from home without a car<P>
<H5>CHOOSE HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES</H5><P>
	By raising the deductible on collision and comprehensive coverage, you can substantially lower your insurance premiums.<P><H5>CONSIDER THE TYPE OF CAR YOU MIGHT BUY</H5><P>
	Before you buy a new or used car, you should check how much your insurance premiums may cost. Cars that have high theft rates, high frequency of claims or are expensive to repair will have high insurance rates. However, buying "low profile" cars such as mid-sized station wagons or four-door sedans and cars with safety features can save you a considerable amount of money.<P>	According to the Highway Data Loss Institute, some examples of cars with low theft claims are the Mercury Sable, Chevy Cavalier, and Mazda MPV Van. Cars with high theft rates include the Mercedes, Chevrolet and Ford convertibles, and the Volkswagen Cabriolet or Golf/GTI.<P><H5>SELECT ONLY THE TYPES OF COVERAGES YOU NEED</H5>	There are six basic types of coverage: 1) Bodily Injury Liability Insurance, 2) Medical Payments Insurance, 3) Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Protection, 4) Property Damage Liability, 5)Comprehensive Physical Damage Insurance and 6) Collision Insurance.<P> 	You should review each type of coverage carefully as each one applies to  different types of losses. You can easily waste money by duplicating coverages. For example, if you already have good medical and disability insurance, you may not want to buy medical payments insurance. Also, if you have collision and comprehensive insurance, you don't need to buy the type of uninsured motorist protection that pays for damages to your vehicle.<P>	You can also save money by dropping collision/and or comprehensive coverages on older cars worth less than $1,000. If you make a claim, you would not substantially exceed annual cost and deductible amounts.<P><H5>COMPARE RATES FROM OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES</H5>	Since auto insurance rates can vary by hundreds of dollars, you should do some careful shopping. Keep in mind that when you compare prices, premiums are based upon the same types of coverages and information being quoted.<P>	While price is an important factor, you should also consider the quality of service the insurer will provide. Check the insurance company's claims paying history and financial strength to ensure that the company is reliable. You can call the Department of Insurance in your state to check if a company is licensed to sell insurance there. <P>	If you would like additional information on auto insurance, WIIS has available the following brochures: "Nine Ways to Lower Your Auto Insurance Costs" and "Insurance for the Car."  Please send a self-addressed stamped business envelope (64 cents) to WIIS, 3530 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1610, Los Angeles, CA 90010.<P>	Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues. For more information on how to arrange for a speaker, please contact us at (800) 397-1679.<P> 
  YOU take a lot of chances as a driver.<P>
   You may be in an accident or have your car vandalized or  stolen.  Insurance is available to protect you from the potentially  huge costs associated with these risks.      <P> Replacing just the bumper on a typical American-made car can  cost over $300.  Medical bills resulting from an accident could add  hundreds, or even thousands of dollars more to the bill.      <P> Insurance companies generally prefer to sell their insurance  to good drivers and may decide not to insure high risk drivers.  Unfortunately, statistics show that one out of every three young  drivers will have an accident each year.  So, insurers do not think  of new drivers as "good" drivers.  This does not mean that you  cannot get insurance, however.      <P> There are several things about auto insurance that you should  know BEFORE you shop around

COLUMBUS, Georgia -- February 13, 1996 -- The board of directors of AFLAC 
Incorporated today declared a three-for-two stock split.  The stock split will be 
payable on March 18, 1996, to shareholders of record at the close of business on 
February 29, 1996.  Shareholders will receive one additional share for each two 
shares held on the record date.
</p>
<p>
Commenting on the stock split, President and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos

importantly, we believe we are well-positioned in our two primary markets to 
continue our growth.  We remain focused on increasing operating earnings per share 
by 15% in 1996, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, and the 
boards decision to split the stock is a reflection of our continued optimism.
</p>
<p>
AFLAC Incorporated (NYSE - AFL) is an international holding company.  Through its 
principal subsidiary, American Family Life Assurance Company (AFLAC), the company is 
one of the worlds leading underwriters of supplemental insurance.  AFLACs primary

affiliated television stations.

<H4>RENTAL CAR INSURANCE SIMPLIFIED-- CHECK YOUR AUTO INSURANCE BEFORE YOU RENT A CAR</H4>To buy a collision damage waiver or not is sometimes a baffling decision for many travelers at the rental car counter. The collision damage waiver (CDW) covers the cost of damages to the rental car if you are involved in an accident. However, it is not insurance  -- it is simply a provision of your rental agreement that addresses your liability for damages to the car.<P> So before you shell out the extra cash for this waiver, the Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS) suggests that you follow these guidelines to make the right decision:<P> <H4>CHECK YOUR EXISTING AUTO INSURANCE POLICY</H4><P><UL><LI>Review your auto insurance policy or call your insurance agent before you rent a car. You don't want to pay extra money for coverages you already have. Most auto insurance policies will provide liability insurance if you injure someone in an accident. However, damages to the rental car are only covered under your policy's comprehensive and collision coverage. Make sure your auto policy includes this type of coverage.<P> </UL><H4>CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARDS</H4><P> <UL><LI>In some cases, your credit card will pay for damages to a rental car in the event of an accident. To be eligible, you probably would have to decline the collision damage waiver as well as charge the full amount of the rental car on your card. Make sure your credit card offers these services. Also make sure you understand all limitations and exclusions your credit card may issue such as limited rental contracts and approved rental dealers.<P> </UL><H4>YOU MAY NEED TO BUY THE CDW</H4><P> You can safely decline the collision damage waiver if you're absolutely sure your auto insurance or credit card applies. However, buying the collision damage waiver could be the answer for some travelers. Here are the reasons why:<P> 
<LI>If you aren't covered under your own insurance or credit card then you may consider purchasing the collision damage waiver. It's a better option to pay about $8 to $11 a day than $15,000 to $20,000 to replace the rental car.<P> <LI>The collision damage waiver pays for "loss of use." This is what the rental car company charges you for the money and time it lost since the vehicle could not be rented. Most states do not cover loss of use under an auto insurance policy. The exceptions are: Alaska, Connecticut, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, New York, Rhode Island and Texas.<P> <LI>If you are involved in an accident, some rental car companies want payment upfront, meaning you'll have to wait to be reimbursed from your own insurance company. This is an expensive price to pay for some travelers, therefore some may just opt to pay the extra price for the collision damage waiver.<P> <LI>Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues.

<H4>HOLIDAY CRAFT SALES REQUIRE SPECIAL INSURANCE CONSIDERATIONS</H4>As a home-based business catering to the often profitable holiday market, you probably are thinking about the adorable craft items you've made, the people who will buy them from you, and the fairs and sales where you'll sell them.  But as the dollar signs dance in your head, you also need to make sure you're protected so the holidays don't become a nightmare.<P>"While it's tempting to keep a rosy outlook on things -- especially during such a festive time of year -- it's important to put together a worst-case scenario that could affect your home-based business," says Regional Manager Nancy Barnett, Western Insurance Information Service.  "Then check your insurance to see if your business is adequately protected should the worst actually happen."<P>For example, if a customer or vendor slips on a patch of ice on your front porch and suffers a head injury, how would the medical bills and negligence lawsuit filed against you be paid?  How would you recover your losses if a fire destroys your stock?  What would you do if one of your customers' children is harmed while playing with an item you sold?<P>If your answer to any of these questions was homeowners insurance, you may be setting yourself up for a nasty and expensive surprise should you have to file a claim.  "A standard homeowners insurance policy most likely won't cover more than $2,500 for business equipment and almost never covers any liability claim related to your business operations," Barnett notes.<P>So what should you do?  Barnett suggests you talk with your insurance agent or company representative to see what kind of coverage you need for your specific home-based business.  In some cases, a simple endorsement on your homeowners insurance policy is all you need.  In other cases, you may want tocustomize your insurance coverage by purchasing several individual business insurance policies, such as:<UL><LI>business property (provides coverage for losses arising from fire, wind, hail, damage during transit, vandalism, etc.);<LI>commercial crime insurance (provides coverage for losses arising from theft, forgery & alteration, employee dishonesty, etc.); and <LI>commercial general liability (provides coverage primarily for liability losses arising from premises, operations, products, and completed operations).</UL><P>Another way to protect your business is to buy a business owners package policy, which combines several individual insurance policies into a single policy.  You also may want to ask about the new mini business owners package policy designed specifically for home businesses.<P>If you're thinking that this doesn't apply to you because you simply hold yard or garage sales only during the holiday season, think again.  "While an occasional garage sale at your house normally would be covered by your homeowners insurance," Barnett explains, "no homeowners insurance will provide coverage for a regular, scheduled, profit-making event.  Your homeowners insurance also won't apply if you sell your crafts at a flea market or in a booth at the mall or at any holiday event."  Again, you may want to see if you should purchase a liability policy, or at least check to see if the organization sponsoring the sale has adequate insurance to cover the participants.<P>If you take just a few minutes to review the insurance needs of your home-based business, you can help keep those dollar signs dancing in your head from disappearing because of a fire, theft or lawsuit.<P>To help you learn about the insurance options available to you, Western Insurance Information Service provides a helpful brochure free of charge. To request your free copy of "Insuring Your Home Business," please write to Western Insurance Information Service, 6565 S. Dayton St., Suite 2400, Englewood, CO 80111.<P>

<H4>
MAKING YOUR WORKERS COMPENSATION  SYSTEM WORK
FOR YOU AND YOUR EMPLOYEES</H4>


You've outfitted your employees with protective clothing, put guards on the machines and taken all the other loss prevention steps that your insurer advised.  What else can you do to minimize the risk of injury in your workplace and lower workers compensation costs?
<P>
"Remember that the workers compensation system works best when there is a team approach by workers, employers, workers compensation insurers and health care providers," says Nancy Barnett, Western Insurance Information Service Rocky Mountain regional manager.
<P>
Talk to your employees about how you're trying to keep the workplace safe, how you need their help and how the workers compensation system you have in place will provide them with medical benefits and lost wages in case, despite your and their best efforts, one of them is injured.
<P>
Be sure to explain how the workers compensation system works.  Many injured workers delay filing a claim because no one has explained the process to them.  A lot of workers rush to lawyers because they mistakenly believe the only way they'll get any money for medical expenses and lost wages is to hire an attorney to help them through the system.  Hiring a lawyer often results in delays, further slowing down recovery.
<P>
According to Dr. Sean Mooney, Insurance Information Institute senior vice president and author of Insuring Your Business, "Studies have shown that workers get better faster and return to work sooner when they get appropriate medical care immediately after the injury occurs.  Immediately.  Before activity makes the conditions worse."
<P>
You should also work with your workers compensation insurer to identify appropriate medical care providers in your area.  Unfortunately, a lot of medical providers, as well as lawyers, are tempted by the deep pockets of insurance companies.  Insurance companies estimate that at least 20 percent of workers compensation claims are fraudulent.  What your injured employee needs is quality medical care, not someone who's trying to milk the system.  Your workers compensation insurer can give you names of skilled doctors who can provide your injured workers with such care.
<P>
And make sure your employees know the proper way to report an accident.  The more time that elapses between an accident and when the injury is reported, the greater the difference between what is submitted on the report and what actually happened.
<P>
In fact, "You ought to consider having one person in your business help with all the reporting," recommends Mooney.  "This is especially important if you have some workers with a minimal grasp of English.  Forms in general, no matter how simply they're constructed, can be daunting.  They're especially threatening to persons whose first language is not English and who have little or no experience in filling them out," Mooney says.
<P>
Mooney adds that the person you designate to help fill out forms also can type the information or make sure the information is entered legibly.  One large insurer says that most injury reports are filled out by hand and often are incomplete or illegible.  Moreover, they arrive on average 18 days after the accident.  Incomplete and illegible forms just necessitate a lot of information checking between the insurer and the injured worker, an activity that irks everyone concerned.
<P>
If the injured worker has to go to the hospital or recuperate at home, Barnett urges employers to, "Stay in touch.  Those workers are injured -- they haven't been dismissed.  A phone call, a card, a note with news about a project the employee worked on or even about the birth of a co-worker's baby will show the worker that he or she is a valued contributor to your business and an important part of its community."
<P>
Make sure your employees understand that you expect them to return to work as soon as possible.  Some persons think an injury automatically means spending a couple of weeks at home.  Before any of your employees is injured, you've got to let them know that because your business is a small one, you need all your people on the job.
<P>
But be sensitive to their needs.  Once they're back at work, allow them time to get up to speed.  As Barnett points out, "You don't want them coming back to work in reasonable time, trying to work at their pre-injury pace and suffering a relapse or a second injury."  If at all possible, give the injured employee who has returned to work an alternative job that's suited to his or her post-injury abilities.  Make sure the worker understands that the modified duty is limited to the time it is medically necessary.  Ask the employee to let you know when the doctor removes any medical restrictions.  Successful return-to-work programs have reduced total workers comp indemnity costs by 20 percent to 40 percent.
<P>
Brainstorm with your employees on how all of you can improve productivity, increase safety and lower workers compensation costs.  If your employees suggest the solutions to the problems, they will be more likely to implement them than they would be if you merely give them a list of safety procedures to follow.
<P>
One final point.  Because all of these actions are designed to lower your workers compensation claim costs, Mooney suggests that you consider setting up a program that will allow your workers to share in any savings.  Such an incentive might make your employees committed to workplace safety and save you money.

<H2>History Of Holman Insurance Brokers Ltd.</H2>
<P>

<br>
<p>



 <p>   Originally, Frank T. Holman F.I.I.C., C.I.B., A.I.B. (Que.) formed Holman Insurance Brokers Ltd. in  
    1981 with an aim to provide insurance protection for specialized professions and complex risks. With 
    his knowledge of more than 25 years in the insurance industry and his experience as a Lloyd's of     
    London correspondent, he developed an expertise in specialty risks.  As the business developed and
    the company expanded, Frank was joined by his sons Paul B.A. (Hons.), Mark B.A., and Christopher
    A.I.I.C., each of who offered different backgrounds and interests to strengthen the firm. 

<p>    Since 1987, Holman has acquired many smaller brokers to diversify their portfolio. In 1988, Holman
    purchased their own condominium covering approximately 6200 sq. ft. in one of the largest
    commercial/industrial parks in Canada at the corner of Highway 7 and 404. We have now grown into a
    full service brokerage with more than 60 employees. 

<p>    Holman maintains close contact with insurance organizations and is a member of the Insurance Brokers
    Association of Ontario (I.B.A.O.), the Insurance Institute of Canada and is Registered with the
    Insurance Brokers of Ontario (R.I.B.O.). In addition, we operate in all provinces and territories
    across Canada except British Columbia and Saskatchewan (where we have local representatives). 

<p>    Depending on the customers needs, professionals from one of Holman's five divisions will make up the 
    team that services the customer. Holman's team of knowledgeable, innovative professionals will work  
    together to provide the most appropriate insurance program to suit the customer. We will aggressively
    market the insurance coverages required and provide innovative options to ensure the best possible   
    protection at the most competitive price.

<p>    Holman is an aggressive, service oriented brokerage. Our reputation for commitment, quality and
    service is well earned, respected and is second to none.

<H4>CATASTROPHE PLANNING FOR BUSINESSES -- RECOVER QUICKLY AFTER A DISASTER BY DEVELOPING AN EMERGENCY PLAN</H4><P> Catastrophes not only leave an impact on thousands of homeowners and renters, but on a community's businesses as well. Many businesses can be either destroyed or forced to close due to severe damages, costing businessowners huge financial losses. In addition, some businesses may not have the right kind of insurance or enough insurance to cover their losses, which may make it difficult for them to recover quickly.<P> In anticipation of the next major disaster, Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS) suggests that businessowners follow a four-point catastrophe recovery strategy outlined in the brochure, "How to Survive a Catastrophe: A Guide for Businesses."<P>The brochure emphasizes that businesses can recover quickly from a major disaster if they plan for it in advance. This means developing a plan that details what employees should do once a disaster strikes and also having the right amount of insurance to finance the recovery of a business.<P>The four-point strategy highlighted in the brochure includes: 1) minimizing the risk of damage in advance of an emergency; 2) developing a disaster recovery plan; 3) reviewing your insurance program; and 4) reviewing all the components of your disaster recovery strategy on a regular basis.<P>To minimize the risk of damage in advance of an emergency, businessowners should reduce the chance of fire in their building by training employees about fire safety, making sure there are enough fire extinguishers in working order, and locating the business in a fire-resistive building and in a building with a fire alarm system connected to the local fire department. Businesses should also make sure their building conforms to damage-resistance building codes in case of a violent windstorm or earthquake.<P>The disaster recovery plan of a business should include the following elements:<UL><LI>keep duplicate records of accounts receivables<LI>other important business records and lists of equipment<LI>identify critical business activities and the resources needed to support them<LI>find alternative facilities, equipment and supplies, and locate qualified contractors<LI>set up an emergency response plan and train employees how to carry it out<LI>compile a list of important phone numbers and addresses; decide on a communications strategy to prevent loss of clients/customers.</UL><P>Insurance also plays a major role in the recovery of a business after a disaster, so businesses should review their policies regularly to ensure there are no gaps in coverage. Businesses should make sure they have enough coverage to pay for indirect costs of a disaster, (e.g. disruption to the business) and the cost to repair or rebuild.<P>Businesses should also consider property, business interruption and extra-expense insurance policies. For property insurance, the businessowner should ask these questions:<UL><LI>Am I insured for current replacement prices?<LI>Are the improvements I've made recently covered?<LI>Are there any limitations to my policy?<LI>Am I located in an earthquake-prone or flood zone? (note: typical property insurance policies don't cover flood or earthquake damage).</UL><P>If you have a business interruption policy, make sure the limits are sufficient enough to cover the business for more than a few days in case it may take longer for your business to get back on track. Businesses may also consider purchasing extra-expense insurance, which reimburses you for what you spend, over and above your normal operating expenses to avoid having to shut down during the restoration period.<P>Finally, businessowners should review on a regular basis all the components of the four-point disaster recovery strategy.<P>For a free copy of this brochure send a self-addressed, stamped, business envelope to WIIS, 3530 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1610, Los Angeles, CA 90010. If you would like more information on business insurance, WIIS also has available "Insurance for Businessowners: How to find an agent, how to file a claim, how to save money."<P>Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues.

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</P><P> </P><P>DATE: February 13, 1996</P><P>CONTACT: Joy Gmeiner (303) 220-4875</P><P> Peter Rowe (303) 220-4876</P><CENTER><P><BR> HELPING THE GRANDKIDS THROUGH COLLEGE</P><P>Sometimes it Just Might be Better to Give Than toReceive</P></CENTER><P>DENVER -- At $231,140, the average cost ofraising a child to college age has never been higher(according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture). Add tothis the price of a top-shelf four-year college degree at$113,840, and the cost of preparing a youngster for adulthoodcan be staggering.</P><P>&quot;Grandparents can be a tremendous amount of helpwith this financial burden. And, through strategic giftingwhile alive, not only are they able watch their offspringenjoy the gift, but they can also dramatically reduce theportion of their estate lost to taxes,&quot; said BryanSchmitt, an academic associate at the National Endowment forFinancial <BR>Education&reg; (NEFE&reg;).</P><P>So, sometimes it really can be better to give than toreceive. The first issue to keep in mind when reviewing thebasics of estate taxes is the &quot;unified credit,&quot;said Schmitt.</P><P>Each taxpayer is entitled to one unified credit, whichworks this way: if your estate is under $600,000, thegovernment allows you a unified credit of $192,800, which isequal to the estate tax on $600,000. Each individual,therefore, can pass on up to $600,000 of assets tax free. Ahusband and wife who each have assets of $600,000 can pass on$1.2 million tax free. For this reason, it's important thatspouses with estates at this level do not jointly own allassets. When assets are passed on in this manner, theproperty of the deceased spouse transfers automatically tothe surviving spouse. This deprives the estate of theopportunity to reduce its holdings by $600,000 without payingtaxes on that amount, opening to estate taxes upon thesurvivor's death any amount over and above the $600,000threshold.</P><P>Another extremely effective technique exists in gifting.You can give away, tax free, $10,000 annually to as manybeneficiaries as you choose. &quot;This is where helpingdefer the cost of raising your grandchildren comes intoplay,&quot; said Schmitt. &quot;As long as you don't exceedthe $10,000 cushion, you can still claim the entire unifiedcredit upon your death. However, in the meantime, you cangive away $10,000 a year to each of as many beneficiaries asyou chose (they need not be family members). If you'remarried, your spouse is also entitled to the $10,000 giftingprovision, meaning that, between both of you, you can giveaway up to $20,000 annually to each of as many recipients asyou choose, without tax liability.&quot;</P><P>Of course, not every couple is in a position to give away$20,000 or more of their own assets every year. Schmittstrongly recommends seeking the advice of a qualifiedfinancial planner or tax advisor prior to making any decisionthat could adversely impact your ability to generate incomeduring retirement.</P><P>&quot;However, for those for whom the $600,000 thresholdis an issue, an annual gifting plan can significantly reduceestate taxes upon their death,&quot; said Schmitt. &quot;Thisis particularly true given the fact that each $10,000 removedfrom the grandparent's estate reduces the amount of incomethat would be earned by that money (and, thus added back intothe estate) over the course of the grandparent'slife.&quot;</P><P>One additional caveat: gifts in excess of $10,000annually during your lifetime are counted against the unifiedcredit. In other words, if you give away $15,000 to a singleindividual in one calendar year, $10,000 will be considered atax-free gift, while $5,000 will be taxable, requiring thefiling of a gift tax return. The $5,000 in excess of the$10,000 limit will be deducted from the $600,000 amount, andupon your death, you will only be able to give away $595,000before estate taxes kick in. </P><P>Another particularly effective way to pass along wealthis through growth stocks purchased in your grandchildren'snames. For starters, this reduces the size of your estate andtherefore your estate tax liability. Growth stocks also arean excellent investment for grandchildren because they aredesigned for long-term capital appreciation and pay lowdividends. This is particularly important for a child underage 14, for whom the &quot;kiddie tax&quot; comes into play.The kiddie tax&quot; work this way: the first $650 of incomeis not taxable; the second $650 is subject to only a 15percent income tax rate. However, any investment incomebeyond $1,300 is taxed at the parents' tax rate. An exampleof this with $1,600 of investment income would be asfollows:</P><P> non-taxable income: $650</P><P> income taxed at 15%: 650 </P><P> income taxed at parents' rate: 300 </P><P> Total investment income $1,600 </P><P>&quot;With any of these scenarios, you want to avoidshooting yourself in the foot to spite the taxman,&quot; saidSchmitt. &quot;It is never a good idea to make a decisionregarding your estate based entirely on the tax consequences.If you need the income generated by a portion of your estateto maintain the standard of living to which you areaccustomed, don't reduce that income by making annual gifts.However, if you want to help your children and grandchildrenand can do so without compromising your own lifestyle, agifting program using either stocks or cash can be anexcellent way to provide some help while you are alive,&quot;said Schmitt.</P><P>The National Endowment for Financial Education is aindependent nonprofit institution that advocates standardsfor all financial advisors and is dedicated to the goal ofhelping Americans achieve financial well-being.

<h2>DUI/DWI Laws
<hr noshade></h2>

<p align=left>
License suspension or revocation traditionally follows conviction for alcohol-impaired driving.  Under a procedure called administrative license suspension, licenses are taken before conviction when a driver fails or refuses to take a chemical test.  Because administrative license suspension laws are independent of criminal procedures and are invoked right after arrest, they've been found to be more effective than traditional post-conviction sanctions.  Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia have administrative license suspension laws. These and other differences among alcohol-impaired driving laws in the 50 states as of July 1995 are summarized below:
<pre>
    BAC Defined as Illegal       Admin. License    Restore  Driving    Mandatory Jail or
Per Se: All Drivers(1)/Special     Suspension      PrivilegesDuring    Community Service
Provisions for Young Drivers(2)  1st Offense(3)    Suspension?(3,4)   for 1st Offense?(3)

<h3>Mathis Elected Kemper National President and Chief Executive
Officer
<hr noshade></h3>

<p>David B. Mathis, 57, has been elected president and chief
executive officer of the Kemper National Insurance Companies,
returning in a full-time capacity to the organization where he
began his professional career. Alfred K. Kenyon, 61, has
retired as president and chief operating officer. Kenyon had
been the acting chief executive officer since March 1995.

<p>Mathis was most recently chairman and chief executive officer of
Kemper Corporation, which was acquired by Zurich Insurance
Company and an investor group Jan. 4, 1996. Since May 1995,
Mathis has also served as chairman of the boards of Kemper
National, a post he retains. As previously announced, Mathis
had been designated to become Kemper National chief executive
officer after the Kemper Corporation sale was effected. 

<p>"I am glad to be returning to my roots at Kemper National, where
I began my professional career 35 years ago," said Mathis. 
"Because of the excellent job Al Kenyon and his team have done
managing this company over the last year, I know I can assume
the chief executive officer role with ease," he said. "The
transition period during which Al led Kemper National was smooth
and orderly, just as planned."

<p>"With the help and hard work of the whole staff, we accomplished
our mission to turn over to Dave Mathis a company poised towards
growth and improvement. And that is where we are now," said
Kenyon, who concludes a 35-year career with Kemper National. 
"We've made good strides. But those are just the first steps on
what I see as a journey of success for this company. And I
don't know anyone better to complete that journey than Dave
Mathis."

<p>Kenyon, who is a private pilot, plans to spend a lot of his time
flying his plane. "I look forward to opening new doors in my
life, but I will miss the people at Kemper National," he said.

<p>Mathis first joined Kemper National's San Francisco
property/casualty insurance operations in 1956 as a college
intern participating in the Kemper Scholar program. He began
full-time employment in 1960, working his way up to sales
manager of that office. In 1970, he was posted to Europe with
Kemper Reinsurance Company. In 1978, he was elected president
of Kemper International Insurance Company, and in 1979, was
named general manager of Kemper National's national/international 
department. In 1982, became president and chief executive officer 
of Kemper Reinsurance.

<p>Mathis was elected to the boards of Kemper Corporation and
Kemper National in October 1988, when the two organizations were
affiliated as the Kemper Group and the make-up of both boards
was identical.  In May 1989, he was elected executive vice
president in charge of Kemper Corporation's insurance services
group.  In 1990, when the management of Kemper Corporation and
Kemper National was split, he was elected president and chief
operating officer of Kemper Corporation.  In February 1992, he
became its chairman and chief executive officer. 

<p>Mathis, a graduate of Lake Forest College, is on that school's
board of trustees and also serves as an advisory board member of
the J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management of Northwestern
University.  He also serves on the board of directors of IMC
Global Inc. and the Evanston Hospital Corporation, the board of
trustees of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the president's
council of the Museum of Science and Industry and the leadership
committee of the Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago.  He
is chairman of the James S. Kemper Foundation and trustee of the
American Institute for CPCU and the Insurance Institute of
America.  

<p>Kenyon joined Kemper National in 1961 as a field claim
representative in Watertown, N.Y. After holding several claim
positions around the country, he was named claim manager of
Kemper's Northeast division in 1976. Two years later, he joined
the home office in Long Grove, Ill., as assistant corporate
claim manager. He was elected vice president of claims in 1980
and senior vice president in 1986. In 1990 he was elected
executive vice president of the company's insurance services
group. He was elected Kemper National president and chief
operating officer in January 1994.

<H4>RENTAL CAR INSURANCE SIMPLIFIED-- CHECK YOUR AUTO INSURANCE BEFORE YOU RENT A CAR</H4>To buy a collision damage waiver or not is sometimes a baffling decision for many travelers at the rental car counter. The collision damage waiver (CDW) covers the cost of damages to the rental car if you are involved in an accident. However, it is not insurance  -- it is simply a provision of your rental agreement that addresses your liability for damages to the car.<P> So before you shell out the extra cash for this waiver, the Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS) suggests that you follow these guidelines to make the right decision:<P> <H4>CHECK YOUR EXISTING AUTO INSURANCE POLICY</H4><P><UL><LI>Review your auto insurance policy or call your insurance agent before you rent a car. You don't want to pay extra money for coverages you already have. Most auto insurance policies will provide liability insurance if you injure someone in an accident. However, damages to the rental car are only covered under your policy's comprehensive and collision coverage. Make sure your auto policy includes this type of coverage.<P> </UL><H4>CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARDS</H4><P> <UL><LI>In some cases, your credit card will pay for damages to a rental car in the event of an accident. To be eligible, you probably would have to decline the collision damage waiver as well as charge the full amount of the rental car on your card. Make sure your credit card offers these services. Also make sure you understand all limitations and exclusions your credit card may issue such as limited rental contracts and approved rental dealers.<P> </UL><H4>YOU MAY NEED TO BUY THE CDW</H4><P> You can safely decline the collision damage waiver if you're absolutely sure your auto insurance or credit card applies. However, buying the collision damage waiver could be the answer for some travelers. Here are the reasons why:<P> 
<LI>If you aren't covered under your own insurance or credit card then you may consider purchasing the collision damage waiver. It's a better option to pay about $8 to $11 a day than $15,000 to $20,000 to replace the rental car.<P> <LI>The collision damage waiver pays for "loss of use." This is what the rental car company charges you for the money and time it lost since the vehicle could not be rented. Most states do not cover loss of use under an auto insurance policy. The exceptions are: Alaska, Connecticut, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, New York, Rhode Island and Texas.<P> <LI>If you are involved in an accident, some rental car companies want payment upfront, meaning you'll have to wait to be reimbursed from your own insurance company. This is an expensive price to pay for some travelers, therefore some may just opt to pay the extra price for the collision damage waiver.<P> <LI>Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues.  For more information on how to arrange for a speaker, please contact us at (800) 397-1679.

<H4>ARE YOU FINANCIALLY PREPARED FOR AN EARTHQUAKE?  EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE COULD BE THE ANSWER FOR SOME HOMEOWNERS</H4>Earthquakes have occurred in 39 states this century. Although 90 percent of Americans live in areas considered seismically active, only a small fraction purchase earthquake insurance.<P>The 1994 Northridge earthquake in California reaffirmed this fact after parts of Nevada were also jolted by the 6.8 tremblor. In anticipation of the next major earthquake, Nevadans have been busy developing and testing emergency disaster plans and stocking their earthquake kits with extra food, water, batteries and other essential items for survival.<P>Aside from being physically prepared for the an earthquake, homeowners should also be financially prepared. For some people, this may mean purchasing earthquake insurance to help cover their losses and help them recover quickly. Remember, earthquake insurance is not covered under a standard homeowners policy. Without earthquake insurance, you will have to finance all the losses to your home and possessions by yourself or rely on the federal government for assistance.<P>To help you decide whether or not you need earthquake insurance, first ask yourself this question: How much of a financial investment could I stand to lose if a major earthquake were to damage my home and possessions?  Western Insurance Information Service encourages homeowners to consider the following:<P><UL><LI>The likelihood of an earthquake occurring in your area.<LI>Is your home close to an active fault?<LI>What is the nature of the ground under the dwelling? For example, you're at higher risk if the soil is sandy or loose or if you live on a fill area.<LI>Is your home a single-story, two-story or multi-level?<LI>Are the walls and foundations properly braced?<LI>Is your home of wood-frame construction, stone or brick?<LI>The age of your home. Older homes are at higher risks for damages.</UL>If you ultimately decide to purchase earthquake insurance, remember that you should buy enough to cover the costs of totally rebuilding your home. The amount of insurance you buy should be based on replacement and reconstruction costs, not the fair market value of your property and possessions. Your premiums will depend on where you live (premiums vary according to proximity to fault lines) and the type of home you have (wood frame or brick).<P>If you would like additional information about earthquake insurance, WIIS has the following free brochures available: "Insurance Sense: Earthquake Insurance,"  "Questions to Consider: Be Smart When It Comes to Buying Earthquake Insurance," and "Settling Claims After a Disaster."  Please send a self-addressed stamped business envelope (64 cents) Western Insurance Information Service, 3530 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 1610, Los Angeles, CA 90010.<P>Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau also offer free presentations on a variety of insurance, safety and loss prevention issues, including earthquake insurance. For more information on how to arrange for a speaker, please contact WIIS at (800) 397-1679.<P>

<b>Full News from Kemper National...</b>
<h2>What Every Worker Should Know About Workers Comp
<hr noshade></h2>

<p align=left>
Suffering a job-related injury or illness raises all sorts of concerns for the worker involved.  "Who pays my medical bills?"  "Will I still receive my paycheck?"  Those are two good questions, and injured or ill workers should rest easier knowing that th
eir medical bills and lost wages will be taken care of.

<p align=left>
"Thanks to the workers compensation insurance system, workers have the protection they need in the event of work-related illnesses or injuries," said Steven D. Robinson, Kemper National Insurance Companies vice president, claim. "While workers compensatio
n laws are unique to each state, some general rules apply that every worker in the United States should be familiar with.  Knowing how the system works can reduce the worry for workers who are injured or become ill on the job."

<p align=left>
Here are a handful of things workers should know before they suffer a work-related illness or injury:
<ul>
<p align=left>
<li>The system of workers compensation insurance is set by state law and has been around since 1911 when Wisconsin adopted the nation's first workers compensation laws.  Kemper National's headquarters' state of Illinois adopted workers compensation laws i
n 1912, the same year Kemper National was founded.  "The basic system that's been developed has stood the test of time," Robinson said. "Why? Because it works."

<p align=left>
<li>Workers compensation covers job-related injuries and illnesses by paying bills for medical treatment, such as hospital stays, surgery, doctor visits and rehabilitation therapy.  Workers compensation also takes care of injured workers who are unable to
 return to work right away by providing them with a significant portion of the salary they would have earned had they been able to work.  The payment is not taxable.  And workers compensation provides for lost wages and death benefits for the dependents o
f persons killed in work-related accidents.

<p align=left>
<li>Workers compensation provides "no-fault" protection.  These laws remove the right of employees to sue their employers, but in return obligate employers to compensate injured employees - even if negligence is not involved.  The workers compensation sys
tem guarantees coverage for workers and at the same time reduces costs and court workloads arising out of litigation.  There is an emerging trend in some states whereby benefits may be reduced or removed if an injured worker is under the influence of alco
hol or illegal drugs at the time the injury took place.

<p align=left>
<li>Injured or ill workers should report their situation to their boss immediately, even if it seems minor.  The sooner the insurance provider is notified, the quicker the process begins for handling the claim.  Injured or ill workers can recover faster, 
and prompt reporting also helps control insurance costs.  Medical service is started right away with prompt reporting, and the payment of benefits is speeded up.  "Numerous studies, including several Kemper National studies, have proven that the workers c
ompensation system works much more effectively and efficiently for everyone involved if injuries are reported as quickly as possible," Robinson said.

<p align=left>
<li>Injured or ill workers returning to the job sometimes start with a modified job, which eases the transition to their previous duties.
</ul>

<p align=left>
About nine out of 10 people in the nation's workforce are protected by workers compensation insurance.  Workers compensation is compulsory for nearly all employees in all states except New Jersey, South Carolina and Texas.  According to the latest data fr
om the U.S. Social Security Administration, $42.2 billion in workers compensation claims were paid in 1991.</p>

<H4>THE GOLDILOCKS THEORY OF INSURANCE -- NOT TOO LITTLE, NOT TOO MUCH, BUT JUST RIGHT</H4>If you haven't reviewed your auto or homeowners policies lately, you might be facing the same problem Goldilocks did in the popular children's fairy tale. She found the bears' items to be too big, too small, too something. You might have too much insurance for some of your possessions and too little for others.<P>Each year, consumers waste about $18 billion in insurance by buying duplicate coverages or expensive and sometimes unnecessary insurance -- they're overinsured. And unfortunately, thousands of homeowners have found themselves underinsured when a fire or earthquake damages their homes.<P>To keep yourself from being underinsured or overinsured, you should review your homeowners and auto insurance policies periodically. A little research will determine what's just right for you and your family. The Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS) has the following guidelines:<P><H4>WAYS YOU CAN BE OVERINSURED</H4><UL><LI>Buying collision insurance on older or rented cars.<P>Sometimes buying collision insurance on cars worth less than $1,000 can be a waste of money. If you add up for one year how much you spend on your premium for collision insurance plus the deductible, you may actually be pending more on insurance than how much the car is worth. If you make a claim, you would not substantially exceed annual cost and deductible amounts.<P>You can also save money by declining the extra collision coverage offered when you rent a car. Your auto insurance policy may already cover you.<P><LI>Buying medical payments insurance under your auto policy.<P>If you already have good medical and disability insurance under your health insurance plan, you may not want to buy medical payments insurance. You could save about 10 percent in premium costs.<P><LI>Basing home insurance on the current market value versus the cost to replace it.<P>If you base your insurance on the current market value of your home, you could be overinsured. The cost to replace your home is a more accurate figure in determining how much insurance you should buy. For example, if your home is in an upscale neighborhood, a large part of the selling price is due to the neighborhood rather than to the house itself. Therefore you may be paying for more coverage than you actually need.</UL><P><H4>WAYS YOU CAN BE UNDERINSURED</H4><UL><LI>Basing home insurance on the current market value versus the cost to replace it.<P>As mentioned before, base your homeowners insurance on the cost to replace it, not the current market value. If the selling price of your home is lower than it was when you first bought it and you base your insurance on the current price, you may be underinsured.<P><LI>Not having enough insurance on the contents of your home.<P>Take an inventory of all your possessions. This list will adequately reflect how much coverage you will need to replace all the contents in your home. Now compare this figure with the amount of coverage listed on your current homeowners policy. Chances are, you may be underinsured.<P>If you have any valuable items such as artwork, jewelry, antiques or collectibles, but don't have additional coverage for them in the form of "floaters," you may also be underinsured. Many insurance companies will only pay a certain dollar amount for these items which may be considerably less than what they are actually worth.<P>Also when purchasing insurance for the contents of your home, consider whether you need actual cash value or replacement cost coverage. Remember that replacement cost coverage of your contents means that your possessions are replaced without any depreciation due to age or wear and tear. Actual cash value means that the replacement of your possessions are assessed on the cost to replace them minus depreciation for age and wear and tear.<P><LI>Current insurance policy does not reflect recent improvements to the home, increases in inflation and new building codes.<P>You could be underinsured if you have not reported any recent improvements to your home, such as an additional room or remodeled kitchen, to your agent. Make sure that your policy also includes increases in inflation and costs for current building codes.<P><LI>Renters assume that they are covered under their landlord's insurance policy.<P>Wrong! Your landlord's policy only covers the building. You are responsible for getting insurance for your possessions, not your landlord.<P></UL>If you would like additional information on auto, homeowners or renters insurance, please send a self-addressed stamped business envelope to WIIS, 3530 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1610, Los Angeles, CA 90010.<P>Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues.

<H4>DON'T LET FLOOD DAMAGE WIPE YOU OUT</H4>In light of heavy snowfall so late in the season, flood danger is high, especially in mountain locations.  Not having flood insurance may prove costly to homeowners this spring -- when snows melt quickly, rains fall hard and mud flows freely.<P><STRONG>Many homeowners erroneously believe their homeowners insurance policy covers flood damage.</STRONG>  It doesn't, and up to 75 percent of the buildings in the U.S. located in areas with a high risk of flooding are not covered by flood insurance.<P>Flood insurance is available to both homeowners and renters whose communities participate in the federal government's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  Flood insurance can be purchased through any licensed property/casualty insurance agent or an insurance company that is writing flood insurance under arrangements with the Federal Insurance Administration.<P>In addition to making sure you're adequately insured, it's important to know what to do in case of flood.  Western Insurance Information Service offers the following safety tips.<H4>BEFORE THE FLOOD</H4><UL><LI>Know the elevation of your property in relation to nearby bodies of water.  If your home is not on high ground, know where high ground is and how to get there quickly.<LI>Keep apprised of weather conditions both where you are and upstream.  Distant rain or snowmelt can cause a rampaging torrent headed in your direction in minutes.<LI>Be aware of flood watches and warnings.  If a flood watch or warning has been issued, move your family (and your belongings, if there is time) to high ground.  In some cases, flood insurance will reimburse the costs you incur for moving and temporarily storing the contents of your home.<LI><STRONG>Remember: Your homeowners insurance policy does not cover flood damage.</STRONG>  If you decide to buy a flood insurance policy, which is the only type of policy that covers flood damage, consider insuring your home for 100 percent of replacement cost and buying insurance to cover the contents of your home as well as the dwelling.</UL><H4>DURING THE FLOOD</H4><UL><LI>Do not attempt to cross a flowing stream on foot if the water is above your knees.<LI>Do not try to drive over a flooded road.  If the vehicle stalls, you and the vehicle may be swept away.  Abandon a stalled vehicle immediately.<LI>Avoid traveling at night, when flood dangers are more difficult to recognize.</UL><H4>AFTER THE FLOOD</H4><UL><LI>Contact your insurance representative as soon as possible.<LI>Stay away from disaster areas so your presence doesn't impede rescue efforts and other emergency operations.<LI>Drink only boiled water, and discard any fresh food that may have been contaminated by flood waters.</UL><P>Although homeowners may not be able to prevent a flood, they can minimize a flood's devastating effects by being prepared.  Adequate insurance will make your recovery that much easier.<P>

<P>                                                        September 5, 1995</P>
<P>                 Commentary on Second Quarter 1995 Results</P>
<P>                          Sean Mooney, Ph.D., CPCU</P>
<P>                      Senior Vice President &amp; Economist</P>
<P>     Supported by strong capital gains, the property/casualty insurance</P>
<P>  industry eked out a modest 4.7 percent gain in net income after taxes in</P>
<P>  the second quarter over a year ago.</P>
<P>     However, the major story in the second quarter financial results was</P>
<P>  the negative impact of $3 billion in catastrophe losses, mainly as a result</P>
<P>  of storms in Texas and Louisiana.  As a result, most of the key financial</P>
<P>  indicators of the industry showed a deterioration in the second quarter of</P>
<P>  1995 versus the same quarter of 1995:</P>
<P>      -- the underwriting loss (premiums less claims and expenses) rose</P>
<P>         to $5.4 billion from $3.6 billion,</P>
<P>      -- the combined ratio jumped to 108.8 percent, from 106.4 percent,</P>
<P>         and</P>
<P>      -- the rate of return on capital (calculated at an annualized rate)</P>
<P>         declined to 7.3 percent from 8.2 percent.</P>
<P>     There were some interesting sidebars in the second quarter results.</P>
<P>     *  Realized capital gains showed a significant change in the second</P>
<P>        quarter, up 362.2 percent from a year ago.  Without this increase,</P>
<P>        net income would have declined.  At least two factors can explain</P>
<P>        this increase in capital gains.  The stock market was strong in the</P>
<P>        second quarter so companies could show gains by selling stocks.</P>
<P>        Secondly, some companies probably needed to liquidate assets to pay</P>
<P>        for catastrophe losses and hence showed a gain on selling these</P>
<P>        assets.</P>
<P>     *  Investment income (interest and dividends) continued its striking</P>
<P>        recovery, up 9.0 percent from the second quarter of 1994.  For</P>
<P>        the first six months, investment income increased by 8.8 percent.</P>
<P>        This contrasts with the weak performance of investment income in</P>
<P>        recent years.  In 1994, investment income increased by only 1.0</P>
<P>        percent, following declines of 1.5 percent and 3.2 percent,</P>
<P>        respectively, in 1992 and 1993.  One factor behind this</P>
<P>        turnaround was the higher interest rates of 1994, which allowed</P>
<P>        companies to invest new funds at higher rates, thus contributing</P>
<P>        to a higher level of interest income in 1995.</P>
<P>     *  Capital (policyholders surplus) showed a substantial gain of $9.1</P>
<P>        billion to $209.1 billion from $200.0 billion at the end of the</P>
<P>        first quarter of 1995.  The increase mainly reflected $6.6</P>
<P>        billion of unrealized capital gains due to rising stock prices,</P>
<P>        and $3.8 billion in net income.</P>

<H4>FLOOD INSURANCE: WHAT EVERY HOMEOWNER NEEDS TO KNOW</H4> Did you know that most homeowners insurance policies do not offer protection against flood losses? Standard homeowners policies will cover the damage a storm might cause to your home and possessions, but exclude damages from what is known as "rising water." Why?<P>Insurance is essentially a device to spread risk, and few homeowners really need or would purchase this coverage. It is not feasible for a private insurance company to collect enough homeowners insurance to be able to afford to cover those who suffer the loss from flood. This would make the price an insurance company would have to charge to cover its losses too high.<P> However, flood insurance is available through the federal government's National Flood Insurance Program and can be purchased through any licensed property and casualty insurance agent. The NFIP requires all homeowners in all flood hazard areas in the country to purchase flood insurance thus spreading the risk over the greatest number of people and making the coverage both affordable to consumers and actuarially sound for the government to underwrite.<P> Flood is a "special occurrence coverage" limited to specific areas in which all the homeowners would likely experience significant losses at the same time. This special insurance is available for property in designated "flood zones" where the community has adopted sound flood management practices. Currently, there are about 18,000 communities participating in the NFIP throughout the United States.<P> Flooding is defined by the NFIP as a temporary condition of water overflowing normally dry land from inland or tidal waters or the unusually and rapid accumulation of surface waters from any source including rain. Mudflows and mudslides are also covered by the NFIP because they are flood conditions in which there is a flow of liquid mud over the surface of normally dry land,. In this case, the mud is carried by a current of water.<P>Although floods and mudflows are covered by the NFIP, landslides are not because it is a condition in which dry or damp earth or rock moves. Water does not directly contribute to the damage, even though a flood may trigger the slide.<P>Your insurance company will investigate the direct cause of the damage and determine if your homeowners or NFIP policy covers your loss from flood, mudflow, mudslide or earth movement.<P>Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues.

<H4>MAKING YOUR WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM WORK FOR YOU AND YOUR EMPLOYEES</H4>You've outfitted your employees with protective clothing, put guards on the machines and taken all the other loss prevention steps that your insurer advised.  What else can you do to minimize the risk of injury in your workplace and lower workers compensation costs?<P>"Remember that the workers compensation system works best when there is a team approach by workers, employers, workers compensation insurers and health care providers," says Shannon Kelly, Western Insurance Information Service acting regional manager.<P>Talk to your employees about how you're trying to keep the workplace safe, how you need their help and how the workers compensation system you have in place will provide them with medical benefits and lost wages in case, despite your and their best efforts, one of them is injured.<P>Be sure to explain how the workers compensation system works.  Many injured workers delay filing a claim because no one has explained the process to them.  A lot of workers rush to lawyers because they mistakenly believe the only way they'll get any money for medical expenses and lost wages is to hire an attorney to help them through the system.  Hiring a lawyer often results in delays, further slowing down recovery.<P>According to Dr. Sean Mooney, Insurance Information Institute senior vice president and author of <U>Insuring Your Business</U>, "Studies have shown that workers get better faster and return to work sooner when they get appropriate medical care immediately after the injury occurs.  Immediately.  Before activity makes the conditions worse."<P>You should also work with your workers compensation insurer to identify appropriate medical care providers in your area.  Unfortunately, a lot of medical providers, as well as lawyers, are tempted by the deep pockets of insurance companies.  Insurance companies estimate that at least 20 percent of workers compensation claims are fraudulent.  What your injured employee needs is quality medical care, not someone who's trying to milk the system.  Your workers compensation insurer can give you names of skilled doctors who can provide your injured workers with such care.<P>And make sure your employees know the proper way to report an accident.  The more time that elapses between an accident and when the injury is reported, the greater the difference between what is submitted on the report and what actually happened.<P>In fact, "You ought to consider having one person in your business help with all the reporting," recommends Mooney.  "This is especially important if you have some workers with a minimal grasp of English.  Forms in general, no matter how simply they're constructed, can be daunting.  They're especially threatening to persons whose first language is not English and who have little or no experience in filling them out," Mooney says.<P>Mooney adds that the person you designate to help fill out forms also can type the information or make sure the information is entered legibly.  One large insurer says that most injury reports are filled out by hand and often are incomplete or illegible.  Moreover, they arrive on average 18 days after the accident.  Incomplete and illegible forms just necessitate a lot of information checking between the insurer and the injured worker, an activity that irks everyone concerned.<P>If the injured worker has to go to the hospital or recuperate at home, Kelly urges employers to, "Stay in touch.  Those workers are injured -- they haven't been dismissed.  A phone call, a card, a note with news about a project the employee worked on or even about the birth of a co-worker's baby will show the worker that he or she is a valued contributor to your business and an important part of its community."<P>Make sure your employees understand that you expect them to return to work as soon as possible.  Some persons think an injury automatically means spending a couple of weeks at home.  Before any of your employees is injured, you've got to let them know that because your business is a small one, you need all your people on the job.<P>But be sensitive to their needs.  Once they're back at work, allow them time to get up to speed.  As Kelly points out, "You don't want them coming back to work in reasonable time, trying to work at their pre-injury pace and suffering a relapse or a second injury."  If at all possible, give the injured employee who has returned to work an alternative job that's suited to his or her post-injury abilities.  Make sure the worker understands that the modified duty is limited to the time it is medically necessary.  Ask the employee to let you know when the doctor removes any medical restrictions.  Successful return-to-work programs have reduced total workers comp indemnity costs by 20 percent to 40 percent.<P>Brainstorm with your employees on how all of you can improve productivity, increase safety and lower workers compensation costs.  If your employees suggest the solutions to the problems, they will be more likely to implement them than they would be if you merely give them a list of safety procedures to follow.<P>One final point.  Because all of these actions are designed to lower your workers compensation claim costs, Mooney suggests that you consider setting up a program that will allow your workers to share in any savings.  Such an incentive might make your employees committed to workplace safety and save you money.<P>

<P>     February 1995</P>
<P>     The Insurance Industry's</P>
<P>     Contribution to</P>
<P>     Community Development</P>
<P>     - Revitalizing Neighborhoods across the Nation</P>
<P>     - Bolstering Employee Service to the Community</P>
<P>     - Volunteering with Brio and a Big Heart</P>
<P>     - Preparing Students for the World of Business</P>
<P>     - Enhancing the Quality of Life in a Troubled Urban Area</P>
<P>     - Helping the Young</P>
<P>     - Deciding Which Organization to Support</P>
<P>   **************************************************************************</P>
<P>                      Achieving a Stable Society</P>
<P>          Only rarely can a business take root and grow in a</P>
<P>     deteriorating neighborhood.  Only occasionally can parents raise</P>
<P>     children to be whole persons and successful citizens when fear and</P>
<P>     violence fill every moment.  Where windows remain broken, buildings</P>
<P>     half empty, gates bent open and graffiti cover the walls, crime</P>
<P>     prospers and despair sets.</P>
<P>          While America comes to understand this, companies that insure</P>
<P>     homes and cars and businesses have known it for a long time.</P>
<P>     Insurers pay the cost of replacing automobiles and rebuilding the</P>
<P>     homes and businesses that thieves, vandals, arsonists, and drug</P>
<P>     businesses rob or destroy.</P>
<P>          The human losses weigh even more heavily than the billions of</P>
<P>     dollars paid out in claims.  Families can be lost for generations.</P>
<P>     Children are born into a struggle for survival and all too often</P>
<P>     find crime and drugs to be the quickest and deadliest opportunity.</P>
<P>          Fortunately, calls for actions are spreading.  They take many</P>
<P>     forms - public and private.  But not many know that insurance</P>
<P>     companies and their employees are working today to rebuild</P>
<P>     neighborhoods strewn with filth and devoid of hope.  Over the past</P>
<P>     20 years insurers have invested more than $31 billion in social</P>
<P>     projects and given more than $1.5 billion in grants to communities</P>
<P>     that needed rehabilitation.  Insurance company employees have</P>
<P>     volunteered millions of hours to work with disadvantaged children</P>
<P>     and improve economic opportunities for persons needing help all</P>
<P>     across this nation.</P>
<P>          This is a task that can seem never ending because the issues</P>
<P>     involved are both vast and very local.</P>
<P>          Insurers know that.  They are in the game to stay.  They are</P>
<P>     committed to working towards a stable society where all can thrive.</P>
<P>          The following pages detail how specific companies help to turn</P>
<P>     areas of decaying buildings into neighborhoods that are livable</P>
<P>     again.</P>
<P>          These stories do not by any means present the whole picture of</P>
<P>     insurers' contribution to community development.  Subsequent issues</P>
<P>     of this publication will describe what other companies are</P>
<P>     accomplishing.  In fact, a company with a story of community</P>
<P>     involvement that it would like to share should write to Impact at</P>
<P>     the I.I.I.</P>
<P>          This publication will be distributed both inside and outside</P>
<P>     the industry.  We hope it will spread awareness of what insurers</P>
<P>     are doing to improve communities and generate ideas about what more</P>
<P>     can be done.</P>

<P>   **************************************************************************</P>
<P>              Revitalizing Neighborhoods across the Nation</P>
<P>          Here are some truths:</P>
<P>          There's more pride in owning a home than in renting one.</P>
<P>          Homeowners work hard at maintaining their homes and</P>
<P>     neighborhoods.</P>
<P>          Homeownership is key to the stability and growth of low- and</P>
<P>     moderate-income neighborhoods.</P>
<P>          Members of the national NeighborWorks(REG) network have a proud</P>
<P>     history of rebuilding and revitalizing low- and middle-income</P>
<P>     neighborhoods across the nation.  This network of 173 local</P>
<P>     nonprofit organizations has been created over the last 20 years to</P>
<P>     stimulate reinvestment in lower-income communities.  Many of the</P>
<P>     nonprofits are called Neighborhood Housing Services (of Chicago,</P>
<P>     New York City, wherever), but the others have diverse names.  The</P>
<P>     NeighborWorks(REG) service mark was created to show that these</P>
<P>     organizations belong to the same network.</P>
<P>          The insurance industry is a strong supporter of NeighborWorks(REG)</P>
<P>     programs.</P>
<P>          The NeighborWorks(REG) story began in the late 1960s on the</P>
<P>     Central North Side of Pittsburgh, where Dorothy Richardson, a</P>
<P>     homemaker, and a small group of her neighbors decided to improve</P>
<P>     their part of the city.  They were sick of terrible houses, slum</P>
<P>     landlords, rats and roaches.</P>
<P>          They needed money to make their neighborhood livable again.</P>
<P>     It took them a year to convince financial institutions to set up a</P>
<P>     loan fund.  Finally, in July 1968 they were able to hire a</P>
<P>     director, set up an office in a trailer and offer home repair loans</P>
<P>     and estimates, contracting information, and architectural advice.</P>
<P>          That was the start of Neighborhood Housing Services (NHS).</P>
<P>          The success of the partnership of local leaders, bankers and</P>
<P>     business executives in Pittsburgh made it the model for other</P>
<P>     cities that sought to rebuild their neighborhoods.  By 1972 there</P>
<P>     were NHS groups in four other cities -- Washington, D.C.,</P>
<P>     Plainfield, New Jersey, Oakland, California, and Cincinnati, Ohio.</P>
<P>          In 1974 the NHSs were doing well but they were held back by</P>
<P>     relatively limited resources to capitalize their High-Risk Loan</P>
<P>     Funds, the source for lending to their neediest residents.  NHS</P>
<P>     desperately needed a source of liquidity to expand these funds.</P>
<P>          So, in 1974 Neighborhood Housing Services of America (NHSA)</P>
<P>     was established to strengthen the financial capability of the local</P>
<P>     NHS organizations.  As a national secondary market, NHSA buys the</P>
<P>     loans that the local organizations make from their own revolving</P>
<P>     loan funds as well as first mortgages for home ownership from local</P>
<P>     lender partners.  In addition, NHSA provides local organizations</P>
<P>     with interim real estate development financing and originates</P>
<P>     permanent mortgages for properties owned by those organizations.</P>
<P>          By the late 1970s news of the successes of the NHS</P>
<P>     organizations was getting to Washington.  Senators William Proxmire</P>
<P>     and Jake Garn recognized the potential that NHS offered as a</P>
<P>     resource for neighborhoods throughout the country.  So they</P>
<P>     introduced legislation to carry NHS forward through the</P>
<P>     Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act.  The Corporation is</P>
<P>     Congressionally chartered and funded.  It allots about 12 percent</P>
<P>     of its budget for NHSA to cover operating costs and generate</P>
<P>     capital for credit enhancements on notes.</P>
<P>          The remainder of its budget provides local organizations with</P>
<P>     working capital, technical support, training and new program</P>
<P>     development.</P>
<P>          The Corporation also is helping the NeighborWorks(REG) network</P>
<P>     intensify its efforts through a $650 million homeownership</P>
<P>     initiative.  NHSA has been asked to bring in $200 million of the</P>
<P>     $650 million initiative.</P>
<P>          Through the years NeighborWorks(REG) organizations have invested</P>
<P>     more than $6.5 billion in neighborhoods that were once written off</P>
<P>     as lost to deterioration, salvaged more than 114,000 housing units</P>
<P>     for lower-income Americans, made homeownership possible for</P>
<P>     hundreds of low-income families and financed thousands of</P>
<P>     critically needed home repairs.</P>
<P>          Insurance companies support one or more of the NeighborWorks(REG)</P>
<P>     programs through local partnerships.  Some 130 insurance companies</P>
<P>     contribute to the network, providing $1.4 million annually.  These</P>
<P>     companies contribute funds for operating support as well as</P>
<P>     personal leadership on local boards of directors and operating</P>
<P>     committees.  Insurance company support makes it possible for a</P>
<P>     local NeighborWorks(REG) organization to provide insurance counseling</P>
<P>     to its clients and to conduct education and outreach programs for</P>
<P>     the neighborhood at large.</P>
<P>          By June 1994 the two largest home insurance companies ---</P>
<P>     State Farm and Allstate --- had invested $54.5 million in low cost</P>
<P>     capital to NHSA.  State Farm invested $30 million and Allstate</P>
<P>     $24.5 million.  The capital will be used for loans to persons from</P>
<P>     lower-income neighborhoods who don't meet normal credit standards.</P>
<P>          The borrowers on these loans are mainly low income (73</P>
<P>     percent) and minority persons (56 percent).  On average, borrowers</P>
<P>     of conventional loans average about 12 percent low income and 15</P>
<P>     percent minority.</P>
<P>          State Farm has provided human and financial capital to</P>
<P>     NeighborWorks(REG) organizations since 1975.  Over the years, the State</P>
<P>     Farm/NeighborWorks(REG) partnership has spread to over 50 cities.</P>
<P>     State Farm employees and agents have served on NeighborWorks(REG)</P>
<P>     boards and committees, volunteered for neighborhood beautification</P>
<P>     projects and conducted insurance seminars for neighborhood</P>
<P>     residents.  In 1993 State Farm contributed $333,500 to</P>
<P>     NeighborWorks(REG) programs across the country.  In 1994, it</P>
<P>     contributed $419,117.</P>
<P>          State Farm, like The St. Paul Companies, Allstate,</P>
<P>     Metropolitan Life and Aetna, has received the Outstanding Community</P>
<P>     Investment Award for long-term and outstanding support of</P>
<P>     NeighborWorks(REG) programs across the country from Social Compact, a</P>
<P>     voluntary association of financial services institutions that</P>
<P>     commit to make a special effort to serve the needs of distressed</P>
<P>     communities throughout America.</P>
<P>          Allstate has worked for over 15 years to create affordable</P>
<P>     housing through the NeighborWorks(REG) network.  Thousands of Allstate</P>
<P>     employees participate in the Helping Hands volunteer program,</P>
<P>     cleaning up abandoned properties and getting houses ready for</P>
<P>     renovation.</P>
<P>          During the past dozen years, Nationwide has contributed more</P>
<P>     than $400,000 to the NHS.</P>
<P>          The St. Paul Companies and St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine have</P>
<P>     contributed well over $300,000 to support NHS operating budgets and</P>
<P>     fund special projects in Minneapolis and St. Paul.</P>
<P>          SAFECO has made annual grants for the past 10 years supporting</P>
<P>     the loan, homeowner education and rehab assistance programs of the</P>
<P>     NeighborWorks(REG) organizations in St. Louis, Chicago, Los Angeles,</P>
<P>     Kansas City and Oakland.</P>
<P>          SAFECO also provides funds to employees in its 14 branch</P>
<P>     communities to work with NHS and other community organizations to</P>
<P>     develop projects to fight crime and violence and on other safety</P>
<P>     issues.</P>
<P>          Since 1981 Continental Insurance has supported more than one</P>
<P>     dozen NHS affiliates with grants totaling more than $250,000 for</P>
<P>     neighborhood preservation and restoration.</P>
<P>          Help from insurers has allowed organizations in the Greater</P>
<P>     Los Angeles area to rehabilitate and develop more than 850 units of</P>
<P>     housing, benefiting indirectly more than 250,000 residents in nine</P>
<P>     neighborhoods --- four in Barton Hill-San Pedro, Boyle Heights,</P>
<P>     Crenshaw, and Vernon-Central, plus those in Pasadena, Inglewood, La</P>
<P>     Habra, Santa Ana and San Bernardino.</P>
<P>          Insurance companies, including Aetna, Allstate, GEICO,</P>
<P>     Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty and State Farm, have formed an</P>
<P>     insurance advisory committee with the NHS of New York City.  One</P>
<P>     major goal of the committee is to depopulate the FAIR Plan.  With</P>
<P>     the financial help of insurers, the NHS has hired an insurance</P>
<P>     coordinator, James Reaves, a former broker, and charged him with</P>
<P>     finding voluntary market insurance for inner city residents.  In</P>
<P>     addition, he is holding seminars on insurance and risk reduction</P>
<P>     for property owners.  By sponsoring these seminars, insurers are</P>
<P>     helping to increase the insurability of lower-income neighborhoods</P>
<P>     and decrease the number of homeowners insured by the FAIR Plan.</P>
<P>          Working with the New York City Police Department and the NHS</P>
<P>     of Bedford-Stuyvesant, the insurance industry has established a</P>
<P>     pilot crime prevention program under the direction of Dr. Georgette</P>
<P>     Bennett, a leading expert on community crime prevention.</P>
<P>          A survey by the NHS of New York found that 70 percent of the</P>
<P>     188 houses in its loan portfolio have insurance from private</P>
<P>     companies.</P>
<P>          The houses in the survey are located in the East Flatbush,</P>
<P>     Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsbridge and Jamaica neighborhoods.</P>
<P>          The other 30 percent of the houses have insurance from the New</P>
<P>     York Property Insurance Underwriting Association.</P>
<P>          The insurance industry's association with NHS in Chicago has</P>
<P>     ranged from direct volunteer labor to renovate homes to the</P>
<P>     provision of private sector insurance.  In one neighborhood, the</P>
<P>     percentage of homes insured by private insurance companies</P>
<P>     increased from 76 to 87 percent.</P>
<P>          Insurance companies and the NHS of Richmond, California have</P>
<P>     several projects underway to improve inner city areas.  In one</P>
<P>     project, five insurance companies provided 20 to 30 volunteers each</P>
<P>     to paint homes in a section of the city.</P>
<P>          Insurance companies and the NHS of St. Louis are trying to</P>
<P>     make underwriters more familiar with the needs of inner-city</P>
<P>     residents and homeowners aware and knowledgeable about the</P>
<P>     insurance products available to them.</P>
<P>          The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation is actively seeking</P>
<P>     the involvement of insurance companies in its local programs.  Its</P>
<P>     newly created National Insurance Task Force has 45 members,</P>
<P>     including Aetna, Allstate, American Family, Automobile Club of</P>
<P>     Southern California, CNA, Farmers, GEICO, ITT Hartford, Kemper,</P>
<P>     Liberty Mutual, Metropolitan, Nationwide, Prudential, SAFECO, The</P>
<P>     St. Paul Companies, State Farm, Travelers and USAA.  Trade</P>
<P>     associations involved include the Alliance of American Insurers,</P>
<P>     American Insurance Association, Insurance Information Institute,</P>
<P>     National Association of Independent Insurers and Independent</P>
<P>     Insurance Agents of America.  The National Association of Insurance</P>
<P>     Commissioners and Illinois Department of Insurance have also been</P>
<P>     part of the Task Force.  The Task Force was established to identify</P>
<P>     issues surrounding the provision of insurance coverage in low- and</P>
<P>     middle-income communities.  Information on the Task Force may be</P>

<P>            Bolstering Employees' Service to Their Communities</P>
<P>          Besides providing financial support, insurance companies also</P>
<P>     serve their communities by encouraging their employees to</P>
<P>     volunteer.</P>
<P>          As a result, insurance company employees have donated millions</P>
<P>     of hours to rehabilitating neighborhoods and improving economic</P>
<P>     opportunities for the poor.</P>
<P>          The Nationwide Insurance Enterprise, based in Columbus, Ohio,</P>
<P>     is firmly committed to community service and it encourages</P>
<P>     employees to get involved in their communities in a big way.</P>
<P>          Nationwide employees are very strong supporters of community</P>
<P>     help agencies.  In recognition, the United Way of America in 1994</P>
<P>     presented Nationwide two Summit Awards -- for excellent corporate</P>
<P>     contributions and for employee involvement in the 1993 United Way</P>
<P>     campaign.  Nationwide employees companywide pledged $4.1 million,</P>
<P>     a sum which the company matched dollar for dollar.</P>
<P>          The pledges of home office employees and the company's</P>
<P>     matching contributions for many years have constituted 10 to 15</P>
<P>     percent of the total annual contributions in Franklin County, where</P>
<P>     Nationwide has its headquarters.</P>
<P>          Employees also have gotten personally involved.  More than 200</P>
<P>     of them and their family members pitched in last year to help</P>
<P>     spruce up a United Way-supported community center that was in need</P>
<P>     of maintenance.</P>
<P>          Nationwide employees in the home office annually give more to</P>
<P>     the local food drive for the hungry than any other employee group</P>
<P>     in the United States.  Enough money for more than 345,000 meals was</P>
<P>     raised by home office employees in 1994.  In addition, nearly 400</P>
<P>     volunteers spent more than 1,000 hours at the Mid-Ohio Food Bank,</P>
<P>     sorting and repacking donated food items for distribution to the</P>
<P>     hungry.</P>
<P>          For conducting one of the country's largest corporate blood</P>
<P>     donor programs for the past 17 years, Nationwide's Central Ohio</P>
<P>     employees were singled out by the American Red Cross for two awards</P>
<P>     at the American Association of Blood Banks' national convention</P>
<P>     last year.</P>
<P>          The awards were for outstanding community service in the</P>
<P>     business category for significant contributions to voluntary blood</P>
<P>     donations at the local level and for being the largest blood donor</P>
<P>     group at a single location to the national Red Cross.  Nationwide's</P>
<P>     Central Ohio employees in 1993 donated 10,418 units of blood and</P>
<P>     blood components.  Regional office employees donated another 3,800</P>
<P>     units for a corporate total of more than 14,200 units.</P>
<P>          To handle the large volume of donations by Nationwide's home</P>
<P>     office employees, the Red Cross this year will set up a permanent</P>
<P>     blood-lending center at Nationwide's headquarters.  It will be the</P>
<P>     first permanent corporate blood center in the Red Cross system.</P>
<P>     Employees currently donate during two-week blood drives that are</P>
<P>     scheduled at the company every two months.  The permanent site will</P>
<P>     allow more employees to participate in the program.</P>
<P>          Nationwide for more than 25 years -- longer than any other</P>
<P>     Central Ohio company -- has sponsored a summer intern program for</P>
<P>     low-income high school students.  Up to 50 youngsters are enrolled</P>
<P>     in the program each year.</P>
<P>          The company also participates in INROADS, Inc., a program</P>
<P>     offering summer internships to minority students.  Nationwide in</P>
<P>     1993 established a summer intern program for students of four</P>
<P>     historically black colleges.</P>

<P>                 Volunteering with Brio and a Big Heart</P>
<P>          Thanksgiving dinner for 800 people.</P>
<P>          Say what?</P>
<P>          Most people are sufficiently challenged by cooking a holiday</P>
<P>     dinner for eight or 10.</P>
<P>          But Mary Lanning, executive director of the Insurance Brokers</P>
<P>     Association of New York, and her friends have been putting together</P>
<P>     a gourmet feast for homeless people and serving it on tables set up</P>
<P>     on a patch of land at 125th Street in Manhattan for some 20 years.</P>
<P>          Mary's Party, as the Thanksgiving dinner has come to be known,</P>
<P>     originated when Lanning was ill one Thanksgiving Day.  She had all</P>
<P>     the makings of a turkey dinner in her refrigerator.  Feeling blue</P>
<P>     and gloomy, she decided to cook the dinner anyway.  When it was</P>
<P>     done, she packed it up and took it to a park frequented by homeless</P>
<P>     people.</P>
<P>          She saw an elderly woman in threadbare clothes and torn gloves</P>
<P>     sitting on a bench.</P>
<P>          Lanning told her she had some turkey she could share with her.</P>
<P>          The woman said her daughter would be picking her up shortly</P>
<P>     and taking her to her home for dinner.  Lanning has since learned</P>
<P>     that homeless women old enough to have a daughter who can cook</P>
<P>     dinner always say the daughter is on her way.</P>
<P>          Lanning coaxed the woman into having some turkey so she</P>
<P>     wouldn't be too hungry when her daughter arrived.</P>
<P>          Lanning found several other people in the park to share her</P>
<P>     dinner with.  By the time her basket was emptied, she was feeling</P>
<P>     a lot more cheerful than she had at the beginning of the day and a</P>
<P>     tradition had been born.</P>
<P>          Thanksgiving, Lanning points out, emphasizes the enormous</P>
<P>     distinctions in American society between those who have and those</P>
<P>     who don't.  All the posters show tables set with flowers and</P>
<P>     candles and sumptuous feasts.  &quot;It all says bounty, happiness,</P>
<P>     families,&quot; she says.</P>
<P>          Because most people are home with their families, the homeless</P>
<P>     are left without people from whom they can scrounge some coins.</P>
<P>     &quot;Even a lot of the fast food places are closed on Thanksgiving Day,</P>
<P>     so there's no left-over food in the garbage cans for the homeless</P>
<P>     to eat,&quot; Lanning says.</P>
<P>          The next year, Lanning, who brings new oceans of meaning to</P>
<P>     the word organization, with the help of a number of friends cooked</P>
<P>     several turkeys and fed 50 homeless people in the same park.  Over</P>
<P>     the years the park has picked up a new name.  It's called</P>
<P>     Thanksgiving Corner by Mary's friends and guests alike.</P>
<P>          Each year the number of Lanning's guests has grown bigger and</P>
<P>     last Thanksgiving, she and her friends were hosts to 800 guests.</P>
<P>          Lanning's larder or actually the many larders friends have</P>
<P>     opened to her all over Manhattan, other parts of New York State-</P>
<P>     biscuits for the dinner are baked in homes in Lake George - and New</P>
<P>     Jersey - some church groups there also prepare food for her parties</P>
<P>     - always contained more than enough for the guests who showed up at</P>
<P>     her dinners.</P>
<P>          But, as one could guess, the donations didn't always come in</P>
<P>     the exact amounts she expected.</P>
<P>          One year she had three turkeys more than could be cooked in</P>
<P>     the ovens at her disposal.  In typical Lanning fashion, she left</P>
<P>     signs in her apartment building saying she had three homeless</P>
<P>     turkeys to keep cool until Thanksgiving morning.  At that point she</P>
<P>     would need ovens to roast the turkeys.</P>
<P>          She quickly had offers of the necessary coolers and ovens.</P>
<P>          Lanning, whose vivacity is matched by her persuasiveness, has</P>
<P>     no trouble in recruiting the helpers she needs.  Many of them are</P>
<P>     her colleagues in the insurance industry.  Others hear about what</P>
<P>     she's doing and decide to join her.</P>
<P>          A 98-year-old woman and her 78-year-old daughter cut the bread</P>
<P>     into cubes for the turkey stuffing.  For 800 people, that is a lot</P>
<P>     of bread.</P>
<P>          One Thanksgiving Eve, Lanning took a cab on her way to pick up</P>
<P>     several shopping bags of turkeys.  The cab driver turned surly when</P>
<P>     she asked him to wait while she dived into the store and the</P>
<P>     store's clerks brought shopping bag after shopping bag down to the</P>
<P>     cab.</P>
<P>          By the time she got to her destination, she had told him about</P>
<P>     the dinner.  Surly turned benign.  He carried all those bags of</P>
<P>     turkeys up six flights of stairs to where they would be cooked.</P>
<P>          Lanning tells the volunteers to cook as if they were preparing</P>
<P>     a feast for their husband's boss, the President of the United</P>
<P>     States or the Pope.</P>
<P>          And they do.</P>
<P>          Although the food is served on styrofoam plates for easy</P>
<P>     portability, the menu offers in addition to the turkey, apple nut</P>
<P>     stuffing, whole fresh cranberry sauce, brown sugar-glazed sweet</P>
<P>     potatoes with baked apple slices, homemade pumpkin, sweet potato,</P>
<P>     apple, pecan, chocolate and walnut pies and turkey sandwiches to go</P>
<P>     plus a lot of other goodies.</P>
<P>          But the most important offering at the feast is the acceptance</P>
<P>     Lanning and her friends offer her guests.  &quot;They're feeling</P>
<P>     humiliated enough standing there receiving the food.  We have to</P>
<P>     make them feel we're glad they've come.&quot;  Lanning tells any friends</P>
<P>     who may feel awkward serving the food to munch on a stalk of celery</P>
<P>     or slice of turkey and to talk to the guests.</P>
<P>          The guests include women and children and old and young men,</P>
<P>     about 30 percent of whom have an obvious drug or alcohol problem.</P>
<P>     There are displaced and underhoused families, some of whom, if they</P>
<P>     didn't go to Mary's Party would feast on nothing more splendid than</P>
<P>     a can of hash.</P>
<P>          They are, Lanning says, extremely polite and shower her and</P>
<P>     her co-hosts with hugs and kisses and thank yous and God bless</P>
<P>     yous.</P>
<P>          Anyone who participates in the dinners, Lanning says, never</P>
<P>     looks at homeless people in the same way again.  The old scruffy,</P>
<P>     disheveled image is replaced by that of a real person hit hard by</P>
<P>     disease or the loss of a job or loved one.</P>
<P>          Lanning is adamant about keeping the parties spontaneous and</P>
<P>     fun, something she describes as a &quot;grass-roots, human-being</P>
<P>     adventure.&quot;</P>
<P>          The spontaneity, the sense of being at a party is what church</P>
<P>     or other institutional-sponsored holiday dinners, she says, all</P>
<P>     seem to lack.</P>
<P>          She's also adamant about keeping the media away from the</P>
<P>     parties.  The last thing she wants is some television reporter</P>
<P>     sticking a microphone into a guest's face and asking, &quot;So how did</P>
<P>     you get down on your luck?&quot;</P>
<P>          Lanning has no plans for curtailing the parties or even</P>
<P>     limiting the guest list to 800.  In fact, her dream, she says, is</P>
<P>     to tear down the wall between her tiny kitchen and the rest of her</P>
<P>     apartment, buy a large new stove and turn her apartment into a</P>
<P>     sleep-in kitchen, a place where she can go on cooking for the</P>
<P>     fabulous Thanksgiving parties she gives.</P>

<P>              Preparing Students for the World of Business</P>
<P>          Young people face a tough job market.  Companies are</P>
<P>     downsizing or merging.  Long-time workers are being let go.  Entry-</P>
<P>     level jobs are hard to find.  Students who can't afford to pay for</P>
<P>     training to gain job skills are often those who need a job the</P>
<P>     most.</P>
<P>          ITT Hartford has taken a particularly active stance in</P>
<P>     addressing this problem.  By supporting job internship programs,</P>
<P>     ITT Hartford is offering young people who might otherwise face a</P>
<P>     lifetime of underemployment a chance to develop their talents and</P>
<P>     build a satisfying career.</P>
<P>          Fifty students are participating in ITT Hartford's 1995 Skills</P>
<P>     Training Advancement Group (STAG) after-school work/study program.</P>
<P>     They come from five Hartford area high schools - Bulkeley, East</P>
<P>     Hartford, Hartford Public, Prince Tech and Weaver - and they're</P>
<P>     working throughout ITT Hartford's Home Office complex.  In</P>
<P>     addition, one student is in the company's PLIC Southington office.</P>
<P>          STAG exposes these students to ITT Hartford's business world.</P>
<P>     The students work in various departments and have assignments and</P>
<P>     responsibilities ranging from basic alphabetical and numerical</P>
<P>     filing to field office correspondence.</P>
<P>          Education is the cornerstone of STAG.  During the summer</P>
<P>     months, STAG students receive six weeks of core training in</P>
<P>     Proofamatics, Basic Introduction to Insurance, Microsoft Word for</P>
<P>     Windows 2.0, and Professionalism in the Office.  Home Office,</P>
<P>     Hamilton Heights and PLIC staff members lead the training sessions.</P>
<P>          STAG students are also introduced to ITT Hartford's</P>
<P>     Toastmasters.  The students learn basic platform skills, including</P>
<P>     researching topics and presenting before live audiences.</P>
<P>          Over 1,000 students from Hartford's public schools have</P>
<P>     graduated from STAG during its 28-year history.  STAG helps kids</P>
<P>     develop the academic and occupational skills they'll need in the</P>
<P>     world of working adults.  It represents a real partnership between</P>
<P>     the ITT Hartford community and Hartford neighborhoods.</P>
<P>          And ITT Hartford is the most active company in the Summer</P>
<P>     Insurance Internship Program for minorities at the University of</P>
<P>     Hartford's Barney School of Business and Public Administration.</P>
<P>     The goal of the program, now in its fourteenth year, is to increase</P>
<P>     the number of minority professionals in the insurance industry.</P>
<P>          Students go through three weeks of courses to understand</P>
<P>     insurance basics and then use what they learn working for an</P>
<P>     insurance company for eight weeks.</P>
<P>          In the courses, for which they receive three college credits,</P>
<P>     students learn the basics of actuarial science, government</P>
<P>     regulation of insurance, policy contracts and corporate finance.</P>
<P>          Students say the courses are intensive but are pleased that</P>
<P>     once on the job, they know what other employees are talking about.</P>
<P>          At ITT Hartford, the student interns have been placed in</P>
<P>     Reinsurance Accounting, the actuarial area, the Trading and</P>
<P>     Quantitative Research units of the Investment Department and Human</P>
<P>     Resources, among others.</P>
<P>          Each intern is assigned a mentor for the duration of the</P>
<P>     program.  Interns are involved in numerous activities that provide</P>
<P>     them with information about the insurance industry, including</P>
<P>     company-sponsored seminars, tours and career-advising sessions.</P>
<P>          Between 1982 and 1994 approximately 170 students, representing</P>
<P>     25 campuses, interned at ITT Hartford.  In 1994, 18 students,</P>
<P>     representing 12 campuses, interned at the company.</P>

<P>            Enhancing the  Quality of Life in a Troubled Urban Area</P>
<P>          Thirty years of highway projects and unfulfilled urban renewal</P>
<P>     plans left the residents of Jackson Place Community in Seattle,</P>
<P>     Washington, feeling ignored and powerless.  They were cynical about</P>
<P>     government, wary of anyone offering help and distrustful of big</P>
<P>     businesses, including insurance companies.</P>
<P>          The 350 families of this racially and economically mixed</P>
<P>     25-square block neighborhood needed desperately to reduce crime and</P>
<P>     improve their quality of life.</P>
<P>          They got their chance to do so when the Washington Insurance</P>
<P>     Council (WIC), which represents 48 insurance companies and</P>
<P>     organizations doing business in the state, provided up to $100,000</P>
<P>     last summer to inaugurate in the Jackson Place area a pilot project</P>
<P>     called the Seattle Neighborhood Action Program or SNAP.</P>
<P>          Now, some six months into the program, the neighborhood is</P>
<P>     being spruced up and the residents are developing a sense of pride,</P>
<P>     says Diane Turner, WIC executive director and the manager of the</P>
<P>     Insurance Information Institute's regional office in Bellevue,</P>
<P>     Washington.  &quot;The program has given Jackson Place residents a</P>
<P>     feeling of worth and empowerment,&quot; says Turner.  &quot;It's also given</P>
<P>     them a more positive view of the insurance industry.</P>
<P>          Turner's a member of the SNAP oversight committee which meets</P>
<P>     every Wednesday night from seven to nine.  About 10 members of the</P>
<P>     Jackson Place Community Council attend the meetings.</P>
<P>          With help from industry people like Jim Moran, community</P>
<P>     affairs specialist at SAFECO, and Chris Jahrman, underwriting</P>
<P>     manager at PEMCO, the group has already established a bank of tools</P>
<P>     that residents can borrow to keep their yards and homes clean and</P>
<P>     in good repair, completed a physical survey of the neighborhood,</P>
<P>     noting in particular the vacant lots and the buildings in need of</P>
<P>     painting, and fixed up a room in which to hold community meetings.</P>
<P>          SNAP has added to the value of the initial grant by enlisting</P>
<P>     help from other organizations for the neighborhood.  For example,</P>
<P>     SNAP arranged with Emerald City Recycling to pick up the garbage</P>
<P>     gathered during a three-day community cleanup at no charge.  It</P>
<P>     forged a relationship with the local McDonald's, which provided</P>
<P>     free lunches each day to the neighborhood kids who participated in</P>
<P>     the community cleanup.  It persuaded Seattle Engineering to donate</P>
<P>     $35,000 toward the purchase of $70,000 of new street lights for</P>
<P>     18th Street and Davis Place to enhance their appearance and reduce</P>
<P>     temptations for burglars.</P>
<P>          SNAP also obtained matching funds from Seattle's Department of</P>
<P>     Neighborhoods to hire a traffic consultant to analyze the traffic</P>
<P>     patterns in the area and direct drivers to arterials and away from</P>
<P>     the neighborhood streets they were using as shortcuts.</P>
<P>          Turner says the cookouts and other communal activities SNAP</P>
<P>     has sponsored has led to more communication among the neighbors,</P>
<P>     which has resulted in their tending to look out for each other.</P>
<P>     The residents have also realized that the industry is not there</P>
<P>     just to collect premiums, but is there to listen and to help.</P>
<P>          The program has given special attention to the small</P>
<P>     businesses in the area, most of which are family owned.  The</P>
<P>     businesses, with the encouragement and aid of the SNAP oversight</P>
<P>     committee, are planning to replace the windows of their shops with</P>
<P>     glass that is virtually shatterproof.  That would allow them to</P>
<P>     take the bars down and remove the bunker look from the</P>
<P>     neighborhood.</P>
<P>          SNAP has also provided smoke alarms for homes and businesses</P>

<P>                            Helping the Young</P>
<P>          Executive Risk had fewer than 30 employees in 1991 when it</P>
<P>     adopted the Mary Hooker School in Hartford, Connecticut.</P>
<P>          The school is right across the street from Charter Oak</P>
<P>     Terrace, one of the city's toughest housing projects.</P>
<P>          The children who attend kindergarten through fourth grade at</P>
<P>     Mary Hooker have to deal daily with the dangers of drug dealing and</P>
<P>     gang-related violence.</P>
<P>          The children are often poorly dressed, coming to school in T-</P>
<P>     shirts even in the New England cold.</P>
<P>          Representatives from Executive Risk initially sat down with</P>
<P>     the school's assistant principal and made up a list of needs.</P>
<P>     Among the items at the top of the list were a washer and dryer so</P>
<P>     that the children's clothes could get the cleaning they did not get</P>
<P>     at home.</P>
<P>          Executive Risk sponsored Christmas parties for the children.</P>
<P>     Shortly before the party the kids were asked to fill out individual</P>
<P>     wish lists.  The lists were distributed to company employees, who</P>
<P>     selected the sweaters and gloves and hats and books and toys for</P>
<P>     the children.  The company underwrote the cost of the gifts.</P>
<P>          The company also sponsored each year a graduation picnic for</P>
<P>     the fourth graders.  The kids were given mini-diplomas, played tug</P>
<P>     of war, pyramids and other games and ate the burgers and hot dogs</P>
<P>     the company provided.</P>
<P>          In working with the school, Executive Risk employees realized</P>
<P>     that the children often needed more than warm clothing for the</P>
<P>     winter months.  They needed, for example, eyeglasses and proper</P>
<P>     medication.</P>
<P>          Executive Risk is planning to have another session with school</P>
<P>     officials to draw up a new set of needs.</P>
<P>          Among the projects the company, which because of its merger</P>
<P>     now has about 180 employees, is considering is turning the 11 acres</P>
<P>     of undeveloped land next to the school into a Nature Trail.</P>
<P>          Overgrown bushes, trees and weeds on the land now provide a</P>
<P>     hiding place for drug dealing and gang activity.</P>
<P>          Executive Risk is determined to positively affect these</P>
<P>     students' lives.</P>
<P>   **************************************************************************</P>
<P>     USAA has a program to help its employees learn how to become</P>
<P>     mentors.  In existence for more than six years, the program has</P>
<P>     graduated more than 1,400 employees who now serve as mentors in</P>
<P>     schools across the nation.  The program is centered in San Antonio,</P>
<P>     Texas.  Evaluations of it there show that of the students who had</P>
<P>     a mentor, 50 percent had a better attitude, 36 percent behaved</P>
<P>     better and 35 percent had better grades.  The USAA program focuses</P>
<P>     on the entire child, not just his or her grades.  If the child</P>
<P>     shows signs of abuse or has some needs unrelated to school work,</P>
<P>     the mentor tries to help.</P>
<P>          USAA is encouraging its 2.7 million members to become mentors</P>
<P>     in schools in their communities.</P>
<P>   **************************************************************************</P>
<P>     IRM Insurance, a company of fewer than 200 employees, strongly</P>
<P>     supports education, giving employees the opportunity to tutor</P>
<P>     students during the work day, helping the local school system</P>
<P>     sponsor a summer business conference for teachers, and working with</P>
<P>     the local Junior Achievement chapter to offer high school students</P>
<P>     business education.  The company encourages community involvement</P>
<P>     by matching qualifying contributions to charitable causes and by</P>
<P>     offering employees time off to work with groups such as the Boy</P>
<P>     Scouts.</P>
<P>   **************************************************************************</P>
<P>                 Deciding Which Organization to Support</P>
<P>          The organizations an insurance company chooses to support are</P>
<P>     determined in large part by where it is located and where its</P>
<P>     employees and its customers live and work.</P>
<P>          Over the years each company develops goals and objectives for</P>
<P>     its community support program as well as a method of evaluating</P>
<P>     organizations that apply to it for help.</P>
<P>          In general, companies seek to support housing, neighborhood</P>
<P>     stability, education, health care, youth and child care, and the</P>
<P>     arts in the area where their employees and customers reside.</P>
<P>          To assure that available funds are distributed as fairly as</P>
<P>     possible, they ask these questions about a service organization</P>
<P>     seeking support:</P>
<P>          -  Are the organization's services available to all members</P>
<P>             of the community the organization seeks to serve or does</P>
<P>             the organization discriminate in some way?</P>
<P>          -  Does the organization provide an ongoing service to the</P>
<P>             community rather than a special event?</P>
<P>          -  Can the financial and nonprofit status of the organization</P>
<P>             be confirmed?</P>
<P>          Insurance companies also take into account the organization's</P>
<P>     size, the area it serves, the type of service it offers, its</P>
<P>     reputation for effective action and efficient handling of funds,</P>
<P>     its financial needs and its community image.</P>
<P>          Companies do not bestow a check and then ignore the</P>
<P>     organization and its activities.  Usually, members of a review</P>
<P>     committee and company employees who serve as volunteer aides at the</P>
<P>     organization provide information to the insurer on how well the</P>
<P>     organization is meeting the needs of the community and is</P>
<P>     performing the service it indicated it would perform.</P>
<P>          Each year an insurer must decide which organizations should</P>
<P>     receive its support and what the level of that support must be.  If</P>
<P>     a community's needs change, the insurer will choose to redirect its</P>
<P>     support.</P>

<b>HARTFORD STEAM BOILER REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS</b>
<P>
HARTFORD, CT, January 22, 1996 -- The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance <P>
Company (NYSE-HSB) today reported that net income increased 23 percent in the fourth 
quarter of 1995 compared to the fourth quarter of 1994, increasing from 66 cents per 
share to 81 cents per share.  Income, excluding realized investment gains, increased 22 
percent from 64 cents to 78 cents compared to the fourth quarter of 1994.
<P>
In his letter to shareholders, President and Chief Executive Officer Gordon W. Kreh said, 
&quot;This quarter's 78 cents per share continues our trend of increasing quarterly earnings.<P>
Income for the year, excluding realized investment gains, was up 26 percent increasing 
from $2.35 to $2.96.&quot;
<P>
Kreh said the combined ratio for the quarter of 91.4 percent compares to 91.6 percent for 
the fourth quarter of 1994.  Insurance premiums increased 17 percent from those reported 
for the fourth quarter of 1994.
<P>
&quot;Engineering services revenue for the quarter grew 3 percent from the same period a year 
ago and was down 6 percent from the third quarter of 1995 due to a temporary slowdown in 
government business at Radian,&quot; Kreh said.  &quot;For the year the operating margin was 8.9 
percent.&quot;
<P>
Kreh said, that due to an increase in investable funds, net investment income of $7.8 
million was 10 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 1994.
<P>
&quot;By the end of January,&quot; Kreh said, &quot;the joint venture combining Radian Corporation, 
Hartford Steam Boiler's subsidiary, and DEI, a subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company, is 
expected to begin operations.&quot;  Plans for the new company, Radian LLC, were initially 
announced October 23 (1995).  Hartford Steam Boiler will have a 40 percent ownership 
interest in Radian LLC.

<H4>TRAVEL SMART: TIPS FOR A SAFE VACATION</H4>When you're planning a vacation, you're more concerned about the hotels at which you want to stay, what sites you're going to see, and how much money you're going to spend, than about safety issues.<P> But the cruel fact is that crime against travelers is increasing at alarming rate. So if you're going to travel this year, you need to take some precautions. To help reduce your chances of being targeted by criminals, Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS) has the following tips for a safe vacation.<P> <H4>BEFORE YOU LEAVE HOME</H4><UL><LI>Take an inventory of all items in your home in case it is burglarized. Store this information in a safe deposit box.<LI>Carry passports, tickets, credit cards and important papers on your person. Make copies and put them in one bag. Also leave copies with a friend or relative.<LI>Place essential items such as medicine or contacts in a carry-on bag. Pack only what you can carry because bags left unattended can easily be stolen.<LI>Take inexpensive luggage. They are less of a target for thieves and cheaper to replace. Tag your luggage with a business card or address to avoid advertising your home address to potential thieves.<LI>Check your homeowners policy to ensure it will cover cameras, videos and other valuables you bring. Usually these items are covered for up to 10% of the policy limit. Check your auto insurance policy to make sure you're covered in a rental car.<LI>To check for travel warnings or information on crime in countries you will be visiting, call the State Department in Washington, D.C. at (202) 647-5225.<LI>Plan ahead--know where you are going. Keep a list of important telephone numbers such as airport shuttles, hotel and rental car offices. Familiarize yourself with maps of your destination and if you are going on a driving trip, pre-plan the route.<LI>Budget your trip. Plan how much money you intend to spend for food, transportation, lodging and entertainment. Avoid using cash--always use travelers' checks or credit cards.</UL><P><H4>DURING YOUR TRIP</H4><UL><LI>Always stay alert. Walk confidently and walk or drive in safe areas.<LI>Don't wear expensive jewelry or flash large amounts of money.

*******************************<P>         </h2>                     
<H4>WHAT ROLE DOES SPEED PLAY IN TRAFFIC CRASHES?</H4><P>
"More often than not, when we get behind the wheel of our car, we're in a hurry to get somewhere.  And what do we do when we need to get to work on time or want to get away on a long-awaited vacation?  We speed.  And we greatly multiply our chances of being involved in a serious traffic crash," said Nancy Barnett, Western Insurance Information Service regional manager.<P>WHAT DOES SPEED DO?<p>Speed influences traffic crashes in four basic ways, according to research by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety:<P>
Speed reduces the reaction time drivers need to avoid crashes, which not only increases the likelihood of crashing but also increases the severity of crashes that do occur.<P>Speed increases the distance needed to stop a vehicle.  In addition, speeding drivers may not be able to judge distances accurately, which puts other vehicles and pedestrians at greater risk.  Drivers who run red lights are likely to be speeding.<P>Higher speeds result in higher risks of injury or death in a traffic crash, because vehicles and their occupants in motion have kinetic energy that is dissipated in a crash.<P>Higher speeds reduce the ability of vehicles and restraint systems to protect occupants.  Crash severity increases disproportionately with vehicle speed, so a frontal impact at 35 mph is one-third more violent than one at 30 mph.<P>WHO SPEEDS MOST?<P>While drivers of all ages and both sexes speed at one time or another, high-speed drivers tend to be young males.  A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) analysis found that nearly 40 percent of all drivers age 14-19 involved in fatal traffic crashes were in speed-related crashes, but the percentage among drivers age 70 and older decreased to 7 percent.  At all ages, male drivers are more likely than female drivers to be involved in speed-related fatal crashes.<P>
WHERE DO WE SPEED?<P>
According to NHTSA, about 36 percent of all fatal traffic crashes on rural roads are related to speed, compared with about 30 percent on urban roads.  However, while rural roads account for 40 percent of all vehicle miles traveled, they account for 61 percent of all speed-related fatal crashes.<P>
WHAT IS CONSIDERED A SAFE SPEED?<P>
That all depends. There are several factors that must be weighed to determine a safe speed.  A roadway's design, such as a narrow two-lane byway or a modern controlled access freeway, whether the surrounding area is urban, suburban or rural, current weather conditions, and how well or poorly the road has been maintained all combine to affect safe speeds on a daily or even an hourly basis.  Even in the most ideal driving conditions, high speeds can become dangerous in a hurry.<P>A driver speeding along on a straight stretch of a rural interstate in southern Wyoming might feel that 75 mph is safe -- until an antelope suddenly appears on the road and the driver has no time to react.  Or a driver speeding along a similar roadway in eastern Colorado might believe a high speed is safe -- until last night's lack of sleep suddenly overwhelms the driver, who nods off for a second and runs off the road and into a telephone pole.  A driver on one of Salt Lake City's straight downtown roads might be lulled into thinking he can speed up because of how far ahead he can see -- until a pedestrian suddenly steps into the street and the driver can't stop in time.  Or a driver speeding along a road in New Mexico may be doing just fine -- until a tire blows, and the driver loses control of the car.<P>Safe speeds are relative, so Western Insurance Information Service urges each driver to be aware of the current driving conditions and the posted speed limits, which typically are set based on a roadway's design.  Speeding may get you there faster, or it may keep you from getting there at all!<P>

  *******************************<P><p>
  How to Burglar-Proof Your Business</h2><p>
        It's a production that's mounted every 10 seconds, done with  a cast of one or two, no script, no lights, and no audience - yet  it brings the producers some $1.4 billion in annual profits, or  almost $4 million per day.<p>
       Its name is "Burglary," and it's one of the longest running  shows in history, on or off Broadway.<p>
       Burglary, defined as unlawful entry with or without force to  commit a theft or other felony, accounts for a significant share of  the country's serious crime.  Small businesses are popular targets,  and much of the loss is in merchandise.<p>
       Only about one of every six burglaries is cleared by arrest,  according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<p>
       In the last decade, burglaries in the U.S. have about doubled.  And unlike lightning, thieves may - and often do - strike in the  same place twice.<p>
       In the face of these facts, business owners and operators,  especially those with small operations, cannot afford to ignore  burglary prevention.<p>
  Lock the Burglar Out<p>
       A sturdy lock often will discourage a timid burglar and at  least make a bold one work harder.  Experts say the pin-cylinder  lock may give the best protection since it is difficult to pick.  The lock should be a dead bolt type, requiring either a key or a  knob to set is.  Such a lock cannot be opened by slipping a piece  of celluloid between the door edge and jamb, a standard burglar's  technique that works on locks which catch automatically when the  door closes.<p>
       The ultimate in frustration for the burglar is the double  cylinder dead lock which must be opened by a key from either side,  making it difficult for a hidden burglar to get out of the  building.<p>
       In addition to locks, a bar can be used on the rear door, a  favorite entry point for burglars.  Bars over windows, skylights  and other openings can also frustrate many unauthorized entrance.<p>
  Count the Keys<p>
       Experts advise that records should be kept on key  distribution, and that employees should be required to turn in  their keys when they leave the business.  Having a master key or  one key for both outside doors and inside offices is convenient,  but makes burglary a simple matter.  It is a good idea to code keys  so that only the employees know which locks they fit.<p>
  Sound the Alarm<p>
       Burglar alarms are perhaps the most obvious means of burglar  protection.<p>
       The silent central-station alarm gives the best protection.  This type goes off at a private protection agency or in the local  police station, unknown to the burglar who continues working,  reassured by the quiet.<p>
       The cheaper building-type local alarm system - which wakes the  entire neighborhood and alerts the burglar as well - is preferable  to no alarm at all.  At least it may scare off the thief before he  has completed the job.<p>
       Alarm sensing devices are available in considerable variety,  from radar motion detectors and invisible beams to an automatic  phone dialer which efficiently calls both the police and the  business owner.<p>
  Put Burglars in the Spotlight<p>
       Providing a lot of light, both inside and outside, usually is  effective.  Having each entrance point, including windows and large  vents, flooded with light will discourage all but the most highly  motivated burglar, and will force any burglar to work quickly.  Mercury and metallic vapor lamps serve well since they are well-  nigh unbreakable.<p>
       It is advisable to arrange indoor lighting so that anyone on  the inside can be spotted by police patrolling the area.  It's best  that window displays not block the view from the street.<p>
  Slow the Burglar Down<p>
       The burglar who has actually managed to slip past the alarm,  lights, locks, and bars can still be foiled.  A simple  rearrangement of merchandise can be frustrating or even discourage  the thief completely.<p>
       One device guaranteed to infuriate a burglar is to tie the  cords of electrical appliances together.  The burglar will either  waste precious time frantically untying knots, or will abandon the  effort.<p>
       The same principle can be applied to guns, bicycles or other  items which can easily be chained together.<p>
       A special hint for clothing stores is to reverse alternating  hangers on the racks, making it impossible for a thief to sweep a  line of merchandise off the rod and head for the door.  Attaching  racks to the floor is another way to make a burglar consider a  different line of work.<p>
       Consider displaying expensive goods in the center of the  store, but not all in one place, so that a burglar will have to  work far from exits and will have to go to several locations for  merchandise.<p>
  Make Safes Safer<p>
       Safes, especially ones with complicated locks and intricate  storage facilities, look formidable, but must be used properly to  be effective.<p>
       No matter what the weight or shape, safes can be bolted to the  building and placed near the front of the store so they will be  visible from the street at night.  Since burglars can't take what  isn't there, prudent managers will leave the safe as empty as  possible, banking excess cash at night.  It also is a good idea to  equip safes with silent alarms.<p>
  Use Gratings, Special Glass<p>
       Heavy metal window screens and doorway gratings are an  inexpensive way to protect display cases.<p>
       Burglar resistant glass, a sandwich of plastic between two  sheets of glass, thwarts access to displays and the building  itself.  It can be broken but is takes continual hammering to break  it.<p>
       Private police patrols may be employed, but one of the most  effective patrols is a watchdog, which few burglars are willing to  face.<p>
  Don't Forget the Obvious<p>
       All the hints above can help prevent burglaries, but common  sense precautions must also be used.  For instance, having all the  windows barred will be useless if a transom is left open or an  employee is careless with his or her keys.<p>
       Only by applying all prevention techniques diligently can the  business-owner assure that the thief's profits do not become the  owner's loss.<p>

                     ******************************* <P>
<H3> Nine Ways to Lower Your Auto Insurance Costs </H3><P>
   You may not realize it, but the insurance rates you pay for your 
   car can vary dramatically depending on the insurance company, agent 
   or broker you choose, the coverages you request and the kind of car 
   you drive.  Listed below are a number of things you can do right 
   now to lower your insurance costs. <P>
   1.  Comparison Shop.  Prices for the same coverage can vary by 
   hundreds of dollars, so it pays to shop around.  Ask your friends, 
   check the yellow pages or call your state insurance department 
   (phone numbers are on back page).  You can also check consumer 
   guides, insurance agents or companies.  This will give you an idea 
   of price ranges and tell you which companies or agents have the 
   lowest prices.  But don't shop price alone. <BR>
        The insurer you select should offer both fair prices and 
   excellent service.  Quality personal service may cost a bit more, 
   but provides added conveniences, so talk to a number of insurers to 
   get a feeling for the quality of their service.  Ask them what they 
   would do to lower your costs.  Check the financial ratings of the 
   companies, too.  Then, when you've narrowed the field to three 
   insurers, get price quotes. <P>
   2.  Ask for Higher Deductibles.  Deductibles represent the amount 
   of money you pay before you make a claim.  By requesting higher 
   deductibles on collision and comprehensive (fire and theft) 
   coverage, you can lower your costs substantially.  For example, 
   increasing your deductible from $200 to $500 could reduce your 
   collision and comprehensive cost by 15% to 30%. <P>
   3.  Drop Collision and/or Comprehensive Coverages on Older Cars.  
   It may not be cost effective to have collision or comprehensive 
   coverages on cars worth less than $1,000 because any claim you make 
   would not substantially exceed annual cost and deductible amounts.  
   Auto dealers and banks can tell you the worth of cars. <P>
   4.  Buy a &quot;Low Profile&quot; Car  Before you buy a new or used car, 
   check into insurance costs.  Cars that are expensive to repair, or 
   that are favorite targets for thieves, have much higher insurance 
   costs.  Write to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 1005 
   North Glebe Road, Arlington, VA 22201 and ask for the Highway Loss 
   Data Chart. <P>
   5.  Take Advantage of Low Mileage Discounts.  Some companies offer 
   discounts to motorists who drive fewer than a predetermined number 
   of miles a year. <P>
   6.  Consider Insurance Cost When Making a Move.  Costs tend to be 
   lowest in rural communities and highest in center cities where 
   there is more traffic congestion. <P>
   7.  Find out about Automatic Seat Belt or Air Bag Discounts.  You 
   may be able to take advantage of discounts on some coverages if you 
   have automatic seat belts and/or air bags. <P>
   8.  Ask About Anti-Lock Brakes.  Anti-lock brakes improve steering 
   control and stability when a car is brought to a stop, thus 
   reducing accidents.  Some states, including Florida, New Jersey and 
   New York, require insurers to give discounts for cars equipped with 
   the brakes and some insurers have a nationwide discount in place.<P> 
   9.  Inquire About Other Discounts.  Some insurers offer discounts 
   for more than one car, no accidents in three years, drivers over 50 
   years of age, driver training courses, anti-theft devices, and good 
   grades for students.  See the following page for a guide to these 
   and other discounts. <P>

<H4>WHAT ROLE DOES SPEED PLAY IN TRAFFIC CRASHES?</H4>"More often than not, when we get behind the wheel of our car, we're in a hurry to get somewhere.  And what do we do when we need to get to work on time or want to get away on a long-awaited vacation?  We speed.  And we greatly multiply our chances of being involved in a serious traffic crash," said Nancy Barnett, Western Insurance Information Service regional manager.<P><H4>WHAT DOES SPEED DO?</H4>Speed influences traffic crashes in four basic ways, according to research by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety:<OL><LI>Speed reduces the reaction time drivers need to avoid crashes, which not only increases the likelihood of crashing but also increases the severity of crashes that do occur.<LI>Speed increases the distance needed to stop a vehicle.  In addition, speeding drivers may not be able to judge distances accurately, which puts other vehicles and pedestrians at greater risk.  Drivers who run red lights are likely to be speeding.<LI>Higher speeds result in higher risks of injury or death in a traffic crash, because vehicles and their occupants in motion have kinetic energy that is dissipated in a crash.<LI>Higher speeds reduce the ability of vehicles and restraint systems to protect occupants.  Crash severity increases disproportionately with vehicle speed, so a frontal impact at 35 mph is one-third more violent than one at 30 mph.</OL><H4>WHO SPEEDS MOST?</H4>While drivers of all ages and both sexes speed at one time or another, high-speed drivers tend to be young males.  A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) analysis found that nearly 40 percent of all drivers age 14-19 involved in fatal traffic crashes were in speed-related crashes, but the percentage among drivers age 70 and older decreased to 7 percent.  At all ages, male drivers are more likely than female drivers to be involved in speed-related fatal crashes.<H4>WHERE DO WE SPEED?</H4>According to NHTSA, about 36 percent of all fatal traffic crashes on rural roads are related to speed, compared with about 30 percent on urban roads.  However, while rural roads account for 40 percent of all vehicle miles traveled, they account for 61 percent of all speed-related fatal crashes.<H4>WHAT IS CONSIDERED A SAFE SPEED?</H4>That all depends. There are several factors that must be weighed to determine a safe speed.  A roadway's design, such as a narrow two-lane byway or a modern controlled access freeway, whether the surrounding area is urban, suburban or rural, current weather conditions, and how well or poorly the road has been maintained all combine to affect safe speeds on a daily or even an hourly basis.  Even in the most ideal driving conditions, high speeds can become dangerous in a hurry.<P>A driver speeding along on a straight stretch of a rural interstate in southern Wyoming might feel that 75 mph is safe -- until an antelope suddenly appears on the road and the driver has no time to react.  Or a driver speeding along a similar roadway in eastern Colorado might believe a high speed is safe -- until last night's lack of sleep suddenly overwhelms the driver, who nods off for a second and runs off the road and into a telephone pole.  A driver on one of Salt Lake City's straight downtown roads might be lulled into thinking he can speed up because of how far ahead he can see -- until a pedestrian suddenly steps into the street and the driver can't stop in time.  Or a driver speeding along a road in New Mexico may be doing just fine -- until a tire blows, and the driver loses control of the car.<P>Safe speeds are relative, so Western Insurance Information Service urges each driver to be aware of the current driving conditions and the posted speed limits, which typically are set based on a roadway's design.  Speeding may get you there faster, or it may keep you from getting there at all!<P>

                          *******************************                     Insurance Information Institute                     *******************************   <P>  HOME SECURITY BASICS   <P>  Nine out of ten household burglaries are preventable.     THINK ABOUT IT     Knowing about a burglar's three worst enemies -- light, time and     noise -- can help you protect your home from crime.  A burglar     won't find your home an "easy mark" if he's forced to work in the     light, if he has to take a lot of time breaking in, and if he can't     work quietly.     "CASE" YOUR PLACE     Take the time to "case" your house or apartment, just as a burglar     would.  Here a few questions to get you started.     Where is the easiest entry? How can you make it more burglar     resistant?     Trim trees and shrubs near your doors and windows, and think     carefully before installing a high, wooden fence around your back     year.  High fences and shrubbery can add to your privacy, but     privacy is a burglar's asset.  Consider trading a little extra     privacy for a bit of added security.  Force any would-be burglar to     confront a real enemy -- light.  Exterior lights, mounted out of     easy reach, can reduce the darkness a burglar finds comforting.     How can you slow burglars down?   <P>  Time is a burglar's enemy, too.  A burglar delayed for four or five     minutes is apt to give up and try for another, less difficult     location.  Simple security devices -- including such ordinary     equipment as nails, screws, padlocks, door and window locks,     grates, bars and bolts -- can discourage intruders and keep them     from entering.  <P>   How About noise?     Try to make the general prospect of robbing your home and noisy     job.  Noise is that important third enemy of the burglar.  Many     types of alarm systems are available, with detectors to be mounted     on doors and windows.  Deciding just how much home protection you     need -- and can afford -- is a personal judgment.  Ask your police     department or sheriff to have someone survey your home and advise     you about suitable protection.     Are any of your valuables - such as painting, a silver collection     or an antique chair easy to see from outside?     Rearranging your furnishings might be advisable if it serves to     make your homeless inviting to criminals!     Incidentally, should you ever need to report a burglary or file an     insurance claim, a household inventory - a listing of your     furniture and major personal belongings - could be a valuable     document.   <P>  Consider Some Specifics  -   Reducing the risk of break-ins is simply a matter of making your     home less inviting to burglars than other homes in the     neighborhood.  It's up to you.     Doors     Outside doors should be metal or solid hardwood, and at least 1 3/4     inches thick.  Frames must be made of equally strong material, and     each door must fit its frame securely.  Remember, if it is placed     in a weak door, even the most efficient lock will not keep out a     determined burglar.     A peephole or a wide-angle viewer in the door is safer for     identifying visitors than a door chain.     Sliding glass doors present a special problem because they are easy     to open, but there are locks designed for them.  A broomstick in     the door channel can help, but don't depend on its for security.     Locks     Deadbolt locks are best.  They usually are locked with a key from     the outside and a thumb turn on the inside.  The cylinder (where     the key is inserted) should be pick-resistant.  Ask your hardware     dealer for a reputable brand, or buy your locks from a locksmith.     Windows     Key locks are available for all types of windows.  Double-hung     windows can be secured simply by "pinning" the upper and lower     frames together with a nail, which can be removed from the inside.     For windows at street level, consider iron grates or grilles.     For windows opening onto a fire escape, metal accordion gates can     be installed on the inside.     <P>Make the Extra Effort   -  Here are some "home security habits" to develop and practice:      * Establish a routine to follow in making certain that doors and        windows are locked and alarm systems are turned on.      * Avoid giving information to unidentified telephone callers, or        announcing your personal plans in want ads or public notices (such        as giving your address when advertising items for sale).  Notify        police if you wee suspicious strangers in your area.      * Handle your keys carefully.  Don't carry house keys on a key        ring bearing your home address or leave house keys with your car in        a commercial parking lot.  Don't hide your keys in "secret" places        outside your home - burglars usually know where to look.     *  Remember special vacation tips. <P> The illustration above is a        clear giveaway that the owners are not home.  When going on        vacation, leave blinds open in their usual position.  Have mail and        packages picked up, forwarded or held by the post office.  Lower        the sound of your telephone bell so it can't be heard outside.        Arrange to have your lawn mowed or your walk shoveled.  Stop        newspaper deliveries.  Ask a friend to pick up "throwaway"        newspapers and circular.  Use automatic timers to turn lights on        and off in your living room and bedrooms at appropriate times.        Consider connecting a radio to a timer.  Tell police and dependable        neighbors to keep a close watch on what's happening in your area -        working closely with them is a good way to prevent crime.     ... And Remember This     Confronting a thief in your home is frightening.   <P>  Follow this advice:     *  Run away if you can and call police.     *  Lock yourself in a room if you can't escape.     *  Cooperate and stay as calm as possible should you find yourself        face-to-face with a burglar.     Report any losses to your insurance representative promptly and     accurately.  (Don't forget to check your household inventory.)<P>

<H4>PROTECT YOUR DREAM FROM WILDFIRE</H4>

It may sound contradictory, but the wet spring much of the Rocky Mountain Region experienced this year has produced dangerous wildfire conditions.  The abundant greenery sprouting in the woods is drying out fast, and the Forest Service is predicting the wildfire season will be in full force by mid-July.
<P>
In addition to the wildfire danger that extra vegetation poses, the great outdoors is becoming more crowded.  Consequently, houses are springing up in wooded areas, foothills, grasslands and on mountainsides.  The vistas are spectacular.  The privacy is inviting.  But the danger of wildfire comes with the package.
<P>
It takes only a few minutes for wildfire to turn dreams to ashes.  But it doesn't have to be that way.
<P>
The Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS) offers the following tips for protecting your home from wildfire.
<P>
<H4>ACCESS TO YOUR HOME</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Driveways and bridges must be strong enough to carry heavy 
<LI>Emergency vehicles, including bulldozers hauled on big trucks.
<LI>Be sure that dead-end roads and long driveways have turnaround areas wide enough for emergency vehicles.
<LI>Identify at least two exits from your neighborhood.
<LI>Clear flammable vegetation at least 10 feet from roads and five feet from driveways.
<LI>Cut back overhanging tree branches above roads.
</UL>

<H4>ROOF</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Remove dead branches overhanging roof.
<LI>Remove any branches within 10 feet of chimney.
<LI>Clean all dead leaves and needles from roof and gutters.
<LI>Cover chimney outlet and stovepipe with nonflammable screen of 1/2 inch or smaller mesh.
<LI>Install a roof that meets a fire resistance classification of "Class C" or better.  Wood roofs are especially vulnerable to fires, prompting some cities in Colorado to set restrictions regarding them.
</UL>

<H4>HOME CONSTRUCTION</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Build home away from ridge tops, canyons, and areas between high points on a ridge.
<LI>Build home at least 30 feet from your property line.
<LI>Use fire resistive building materials, especially on exterior.
<LI>Limit the size and number of windows that face large areas of vegetation.
<LI>Install only dual-paned or triple-paned windows.
</UL>

<H4>LANDSCAPING</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Reduce the number of trees in heavily wooded areas.
<LI>Create a "defensible space" by removing all flammable vegetation at least 30 feet from all structures and replacing with fire resistive plants.
<LI>Choose ornamental landscaping plants that are fire resistive.
<LI>Space native trees and shrubs at least 10 feet apart.
<LI>On steep slopes, remove flammable vegetation out to 100 feet or more.
<LI>On trees taller than 18 feet, prune lower branches within six feet of the ground.
</UL>

<H4>YARD</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Remove stacks of construction materials, pine needles, leaves and other debris from yard.
<LI>Stack woodpiles at least 30 feet from all structures and clear away flammable vegetation within 10 feet of woodpiles.
<LI>Locate Liquid Propane Gas tanks at least 30 feet from any structure and surround with 10 feet of clearance.
<LI>Contact your local fire department to see if open burning is permitted in your area; if so, obtain a burning permit.
</UL>

<H4>EMERGENCY WATER SUPPLY</H4>
<UL>
<LI>If your water comes from a well, consider an emergency generator to operate the pump during a power failure.
<LI>Maintain an emergency water supply that meets fire department standards:
<UL>
<LI>a community water hydrant system.
<LI>a cooperative emergency storage tank with neighbors.
<LI>a minimum storage supply of 2,500 gallons on your property.
</UL>
<LI>Clearly mark all emergency water sources.
<LI>Create easy firefighter access to your closest emergency water source.
</UL>
<P>
By using common sense and following the fire safety steps outlined in this article, you can give your home a chance to survive while firefighters race to bring a wildfire under control.

<H2>CAREFUL MANAGEMENT OF MUTUAL FUND RECORDS SAVES TAXDOLLARS</H2><P></P><P>	Mutual funds can be an excellent way to diversify yourinvestment portfolio with a limited amount of cash. But manypeople fail to realize the importance of the detailed recordkeeping associated with fund ownership, without which taxseason can quickly become a nightmare.</P><P>	Initially, participation in a mutual fund may appearpretty uncomplicated. You invest in a fund, it earns moneyover time, and you pay taxes on the earnings. "About the onlything likely to take anybody by surprise at this point is thefact that when they reinvest earnings from a fund back intothat fund, the earnings are taxable, even though no cash wasreceived," said Cheryl Cloutier, JD, LLM, an academicassistant with the Institute for Tax Studies&#174;, adivision of the National Endowment for FinancialEducation&#174; (NEFE&#174;).</P><P>	A portion of the amount received from distributions (thesale) of mutual fund shares is also taxable income as gainsreceived on a sale of a capital asset. Commissions paid overthe year decrease the amount of tax owed on the sale becausethey increase the basis or investment in the fund. "Thecomplicated part comes in determining the amount of taxableincome earned on a mutual fund at year-end after the ownerhas bought and sold shares and paid commissions since makingthe initial investment," said Cloutier.</P><P>	To determine taxable income on a distribution, themutual fund owner must first arrive at a "basis" (the amountof investment in the fund or shares). The difference betweenthis basis and the amount received on the distributionrepresents income. However, if numerous transactions havetaken place, arriving at a basis from which to determinetaxable income can be next to impossible if each transactionwas not faithfully recorded. </P><P>	"Somewhere along the line I have to believe Congresswill legislate that mutual funds provide an average basis,but for now, don't rely on the fund to provide thisinformation (although many funds do)," said Cloutier. </P><P>	Prudent record keeping is the first step toward avoidingtax-time snarls. "There are two things you can do," saidCloutier. "You can keep a running record of your investmentsand distributions, kind of like keeping track of the balancein a checking or savings account. Or, you can have a taxprofessional determine your basis from your annual fundstatements. However, if your fund only provides a summaryannual statement that does not include every transaction,you'll need monthly statements to be able to determine abasis," said Cloutier.</P><P>	If you decide to keep your own running record, you willneed to keep track of how many shares you've purchased, thedate of purchase, and how much you paid for them throughoutthe year. You will also need to record the number of sharessold and the dollar amount received on any distribution. Anycommissions paid on a transaction are also added to yourbasis, which you eventually use to figure your gain and,thus, your taxes.</P><P>	Once a method for determining a basis is established,you must stick with that method of calculation for thatfund.</P><P>	A basis can be calculated using either a cost method oran average method. The cost method keeps track of the actualcost of each share. If you automatically reinvest, you treatthe new shares as a new investment with the basis of thoseshares being your reinvestment amount. You record how muchyou paid for the new shares and the date of the transaction,plus any commission cost. "It's the most reflective way tocalculate what you actually pay, but it's more paperwork,"said Cloutier.</P><P>	The average method involves adding together everythingyou have invested in a fund, including any commission cost:this is your basis because it is your total investment in thefund. To calculate an average basis, generally you take thetotal investment and divide it by total shares. This articleis not intended to teach you how to calculate a basis, butemphasizes the importance of keeping careful mutual fundrecords. </P><P>	If you don't receive an annual basis work-up or annualstatements, don't panic; it's usually possible to obtaincopies of statements from the fund at about $1 per page. </P><P>	Cloutier said the issues surrounding mutual fund recordkeeping are very relevant to older individuals, who typicallyreceive most of their income from investments. As you wouldwith any decision capable of significantly altering yourfinancial picture at tax time, you should seek the advice ofa qualified tax or financial advisor before making adecision, Cloutier cautions.</P><P>	The National Endowment for Financial Education is anindependent, nonprofit</P><P>institution that advocates standards for all financialadvisors and is dedicated to a goal of helping Americansachieve financial well-being.

<H4>ARSON BECOMING A DEVASTATING NATIONAL CRIME</H4>Arson kills more than 700 people, destroys over 100,000 buildings and costs more than $2 billion each year.  Surprisingly, children are the cause of half of all arson fires in this country. <P>Some Statistics on Kids & Fire   (provided by Western Insurance Information Service)<UL><LI>More than 300 people die in residential fires each year as a result of children playing with fire.<LI>Child fireplay is the leading cause of death in residential fires for preschool children.<LI>Fires started by children playing (mostly with matches or lighters) represent three out of 10 preschool child fire deaths.<LI>6.5 percent of those arrested for arson are children under the age of 10 years old.<LI>Three-quarters of all fatal victims of child-playing fires are 5 years old or younger.<LI>Each year, more than 28,000 residential fires are caused by child fireplay with direct property damage of more than $150 million.<LI>Smoke detectors are not present in 84 percent of the homes where preschool fire fatalities occur.<LI>Curiosity is the most common reason children play with fire.<LI>49 percent of all those arrested for arson are juveniles.<LI>38 percent of all children in grades 1-8 have played with matches or lighters.</UL><P><H4>SMOKE SIGNALS:  Recognizing Firesetting and Arson Behavior in Children</H4><STRONG>Children (under 6 years old) -- "Curiosity Firesetters"</STRONG><BR>Signs to look for include play with matches or lighters, burned toys, attraction to fire, and spent matches.Deter through education.  Keep matches and lighters out of reach, and teach children the proper uses of fire, the dangers of fire, and that if they find matches or lighters, they should immediately take them to an adult.<P><STRONG>Children (6-12 years old) -- "Recurrent Firesetters"</STRONG><BR>Signs to look for include concealment of matches or lighter, excitement at fires, temper outbursts, and destructive or physically violent behavior.<P>Deter through early identification and intervention.  Ensure adequate supervision of leisure time, check with your local fire department for a Juvenile Firesetter Program, consult with your family doctor about a mental-health referral, and ask schools about fire prevention and education.<P><STRONG>Adolescent Firesetters -- "Pathological Firesetters & Arsonists"</STRONG><BR>Signs to look for include power struggles with adults, desire to be a hero, lack of empathy with others, sexual confusion and conflict, and rebellious, oppositional and defiant attitudes.<P>Deter through strong intervention.  Immediately contact mental health services, and participate in community afterschool programs, Parenting Skills Programs and Juvenile Justice Diversion Programs.<P><H4>SMOKE SIGNALS: Recognizing Environmental Changes That May Lead to Arson Behavior</H4><UL><LI>Recent changes in the child's family structure, such as divorce, separation, new baby or death of a relative.<LI>Child has been under severe stress in past six months, such as a move to another neighborhood or school, or     loss of friends.<LI>Fighting between child and parents or siblings increases markedly.<LI>Child believes fire can do magical things.<LI>Child dreams about fire at night.<LI>Child talks about fire during the day.</UL> We all pay for arson.  We pay for it in higher property insurance premiums and in higher taxes to make up for the lost real estate base.  We also pay for it in costs that can't be measured in dollars...in hundreds of lives lost each year...in thousands of arson survivors who end up physically or emotionally scarred...in gutted buildings that were once homes or thriving businesses...in added fear of crime.<P>

<H4>FLOOD DAMAGE VS. WATER DAMAGE -- IT PAYS TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE</H4>Water, water everywhere, but not a drop should be there. With dismay, you discover that your home is filled with damaging water. Will your insurance policy cover this loss? That depends on the type of insurance you chose to purchase and how the water entered your house.<P>There basically are two insurance policies that deal with a homeowner's damage due to water -- a flood insurance policy and a homeowners insurance policy. Losses not covered by one of these policies may be covered by the other. Knowing the losses to which your home could be exposed will help you decide whether to buy one or both of these insurance coverages.<P>While insurance policies may differ in the coverages provided from homeowner to homeowner, there often are basic features common to all policies. You should ask your insurance agent or insurance company about the specifics of <EM><STRONG>your</STRONG></EM> insurance policy. In the meantime, Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS) offers the following general information based on <EM><STRONG>standard</STRONG></EM> insurance policies.<H4>FLOOD INSURANCE</H4>As the name implies, a standard flood insurance policy, which is written by the National Flood Insurance Program, provides coverage up to the policy limit for damage caused by flood. The dictionary defines "flood" as a rising and overflowing of a body of water onto normally dry land. For insurance purposes, the word "rising" in this definition is the key to distinguishing flood damage from water damage. <P>Generally, damage caused by water that has been on the ground at some point before damaging your home is considered to be flood damage. A handful of examples of flood damage include:<UL><LI>A nearby river overflows its banks and washes into your home.<LI>A heavy rain seeps into your basement because the soil can't absorb the water quickly enough.<LI>A heavy rain or flash flood causes the hill behind your house to collapse into a mud slide that oozes into your home.</UL><P>Flood damage to your home can be insured <EM><STRONG>only</STRONG></EM> with a flood insurance policy -- no other insurance will cover flood damage. Flood insurance is available through your insurance agent, insurance company or local Federal Emergency Management Office (FEMA). To determine if your home is located in a flood plain, contact your county planning office. If you are living in a flood plain, flood insurance may be an excellent purchase.<H4>HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE</H4>A homeowners insurance policy <EM><STRONG>doesn't</STRONG></EM> provide coverage for flood damage, but it does provide coverage for many types of water damage to your home. Just the opposite from flood damage, for insurance purposes, water damage is considered to occur when water damages your home before the water comes in contact with the ground. A few examples of water damage include:<UL><LI>A hailstorm smashes your window, permitting hail and rain free access into your home.<LI>A heavy rain soaks through the roof, allowing water to drip through your attic or ceiling.<LI>A broken water pipe spews water into your home.</UL><P>Even if flood or water damage is not covered by your homeowners insurance policy, losses from theft, fire or explosion resulting from water damage is covered. For example, if a nearby creek overflows and floods your home, and looters steal some of your furnishings after you evacuate, the theft would be covered by your homeowners insurance because it is a direct result of the water damage. However, the flood damage would be covered only if you have flood insurance.<P>It's important to note that flood insurance and homeowners insurance do not duplicate coverage for water damage.  Instead, they complement each other.<P>It is up to you to talk to your insurance agent or insurance company about flood insurance and homeowners insurance, and then decide which insurance coverages you need to protect your home, its contents and your family.<P>

  Broker:  An insurance salesperson who deals with agents and  companies to find insurance for customers.<P>
  Claim:  A person's request for payment by an insurer for a loss  covered under a policy.  Your claims to your company are "first-  party claims."  Claims made by one person against another person's  company are know as "third-party claims."<P>

  Comprehensive physical damage coverage:  Optional insurance which  pays for damage to your auto caused by things other than collision  or rolling the car over, such as fire, theft, vandalism, flood or  hall.  Frequently required if you have a car loan.<P>
  Conditions: Part of an insurance policy which states your  obligations and those of your insurance company in order for the  policy to be in effect.<P>
  Deductible:  The amount which you agree to pay, per claim or per  accident.  This is subtracted from the total amount paid by your  insurer.

<CENTER><H2> Defining Universal and Whole Life Insurance </H2></CENTER><P><STRONG>DENVER -</STRONG> There was once a time when life insurance was relatively simple.  "The tax sheltering aspects of whole life, combined with its inherent stability of principle, made whole life pretty much the only show in town heading into the 1970s" said Mandell Winter Jr., MBA, CLU, ChFC, and an academic associate with the College for Financial Planning</A>, a division of the National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE).<P>Under a whole life policy, the purchaser agrees to pay regular premiums to an insurance company in exchange for a guarantee of a specified benefit payable to their spouse or other beneficiaries upon their death. Earnings on a whole life policy are set by the insurance company based on the overall return on its investments.  Earnings above and beyond those required to cover the death benefit go to the policy's cash reserve, which you can borrow against, withdraw, use to pay premiums, or allow to accumulate for long-term goals such as retirement.<P>"Then, interest rates skyrocketed.  People began taking a hard look at the rate of return they were receiving from their whole life policies, and comparing this with what they would be earning if their money was invested instead in the stock or bond markets, or just money market funds.  Insurance agents were asked some pretty tough questions," said Winter.<P>Responding to this pressure to compete with investment products, the insurance industry developed the "universal" life insurance policy.<P>Universal life allows the purchaser to set the premium and the death benefit.  As such, it lets people establish a permanent policy with a lower premium than they would have to pay under a whole life policy.  Under whole life, premiums are set by the insurance company based on long-term interest rates and actuarial tables predicting the period of time over which the premiums will be paid.<P>"The flexibility provided by the universal policies is attractive," said Winter.  Also, higher interest rates mean money doesn't have to work as hard to generate the same return.  As a result, universal life premiums are typically lower during periods of high interest rates than whole life premiums for the same amount of coverage.<P>And, while the interest paid on universal life insurance is often adjusted monthly, interest on a whole life policy is adjusted annually.  "This means that during periods of rising interest rates, universal policy holders see their cash values increase much more rapidly than those in whole life policies.<P>"Interest rates in this case are a double-edged sword," said Winter.  "As with any attractive option, there is an associated risk.  In this case, you are betting long-term interest rates will remain where they were when you bought the policy.  If rates fall significantly after you purchase the policy, the odds are good that the premium stream will be inadequate to cover the cost of keeping the universal life policy in force and maintaining the death benefit payable sometime in the future."<P>If the worst case scenario occurs and interest rates drop (as they have since the 1970s), it is likely the premiums paid on the universal policy will need to be increased to generate enough income to cover the projected cost of the death benefit.  If premiums do fall short, the policy could eventually lapse - becoming completely worthless .  "While your agent should make it very clear to you that you are running into a situation where this might happen, the lapsing of a policy you might have been paying into for years is a significant potential drawback," said Winter.  "This is something that will never happen with whole life."<P>A third variation on life insurance is a variable policy, which pushes hardest against the line between insurance and investment products.  While a universal policy allows the policyholder greater control over premiums and death benefit values, the variable life insurance policy allows the policyholder to make choices among a number of different investment options.<P>"This places 100% of the investment risk on the shoulders of the policyholder, but allows choice between a number of options typically available only through a traditional investment like a mutual fund," said Winter.  "The typical combination is usually a money market fund, a bond fund, and equity fund, or a combination of these three."<P>Some variable policies also offer a guaranteed interest account.  However, if guaranteed interest is your goal it makes little sense to pay the typically higher fees associated with a variable product for something readily available in a whole life or universal policy,<P>Which approach is right for you?  The appropriate choice depends upon your short-and long-term financial objectives, time to retirement and family situation, among other things.  Also, the three types of life insurance outlined here represent only some of the options available. Therefore, before making a decision to take on coverage, or alter your existing coverage, Winter recommends checking with your financial advisor or insurance agent to see what type of policy - if any - makes the most sense for your individual situation.<BR><P><HR><P>An independent, nonprofit institution, the National Endowment for Financial Education is an advocate of standards for all financial advisors and is dedicated to the goal of helping Americans achieve financial well-being.  Within the NEFE structure, the 22-year-old College for Financial Planning is joined by the Institute for Tax Studies, the Institute for Wealth Management, the Institute for Retirement Planning, the NEFE Public Education Center and the NEFE Press.<P>National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE)</A>, all rights reserved.]

<H4>GARAGE SALES AND YOUR LIABILITY --  CHECK YOUR INSURANCE BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT</H4>Although a garage sale is a good way to earn extra money for those unwanted items in your home, it may turn into a potentially serious and damaging lawsuit if someone gets hurt while shopping on your property.<P>Before you plan your next garage sale, check your homeowners insurance policy or talk to your agent to make sure you have liability protection. To determine whether you are adequately covered under your policy, the Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS) has the following guidelines:<P><UL><LI>If your garage sale is a one-time event for the sole purpose of selling unwanted items, your homeowners policy will provide liability coverage.<LI>If your garage sale is a regular money-making event, your homeowners policy may not apply. Because this is a business pursuit, you may need to purchase additional coverage.<LI>If you and your neighbors are planning a neighborhood yard or garage sale and plan to make a profit, then you may not be covered. However, if this event is used to raise money for a charitable organization and you do not expect to receive any money, the yard sale may be covered under the homeowners policy.<LI>If your garage sale is being sponsored by an organization with the intent to make a profit, you must first check the liability coverage of the organization. For example, a church is likely to be covered under its insurance policy. However, smaller and less formal organizations may not be covered.</UL><P>If you decide to sell your unwanted items at a flea market or swap meet, your homeowners policy probably will not apply. You should check the liability coverage of the flea market or swap meet or ask you insurance agent about additional coverage.<P>In addition to checking your liability coverage, make sure you arrange the sales items so there is enough space for people to comfortably move around. This can reduce the chance of an accident on your property.<P>Members of the Western Insurance Information Service Speakers offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues. For more information on how to arrange for a speaker, please contact us at (800) 397-1679.<P><

<h2>CUSTOMER SERVICE</h2>

<p>    The services of an Insurance Broker are as necessary as those of an Accountant, a Solicitor, or a    
    Banker.  The complexities of an insurance policy, when added to the need for proper assessment of the
    liabilities and obligations of any Firm or Individual, are such that they require handling by experts
    such as Holman. When you need insurance you want the best value you can get.  When faced with many
    insurance companies and hundreds of policies it becomes a formidable task to find one that fits your
    needs at an acceptable price.
 
 <p>   At Holman Insurance Brokers Ltd. we shop the market for you.  As independent business people we     
    make it our responsibility to find the best protection at the most affordable price.  We have access
    not to just one company, but to many.  We also know enough about the various coverages available     from those companies to give you sound thoughtful and unbiased advice as to which policy will fit
    you and your pocketbook.

<p>    We strongly believe that Risk Management and Loss Control are  necessities for every business and
    should not be overlooked.  Negotiation of policy terms and premiums are important, but this primary
    objective cannot be fully achieved unless knowledge of the insurance market is complemented by using
    Risk Management techniques.


  <p>  The main areas where we feel these techniques should be implemented are:


 <p>   * Risk Management and Loss Control
<p>   
<p> We would make recommendations to ensure that any benefits that can be obtained in the insurance 
    market through risk improvement are brought to your attention.
   <p> * Insurance Administration
  <p>
<p>  Insurance requirements are now so complex and demanding that we consider it vital to provide a service
    on administration which will ensure that routine work is reduced to an absolute minimum.  Our computer
    system provides readily available information of your insurance arrangements.  Changes are made easily
    and quickly avoiding delays.
    

 <p>   The Level Of Insurance Premium is directly related to:

<p>    * Management of the risk - the human factor
 <p>   * Protection & Safeguards - the physical factor
  <p>  * Claims experience - the financial factor


 <p>   As Insurance Brokers our job is to provide the broadest coverage and the most competitive price,
    keeping in mind the objectives of how your premium is determined.

  <p>  The methods of arranging and placing insurance coverage have been constantly changing over the last
    few years and there is little doubt that new thinking is being introduced along the lines of a Risk
    Management concept.  It is essential that insurance is not viewed on a short or even medium term basis
    but with a view to the future.  The Insurance Industry is changing rapidly with new policy
    forms and technological advances to better suit today's changing society.

 <p>   Our success as Insurance Brokers depends upon keeping not only our clients happy but on having strong
    stable Insurers to meet the client's needs.  This means providing you with prompt, personal service,

<P>                    *******************************</P>
<P>                       Twelve Ways to Lower Your</P>
<P>                       Homeowners Insurance Costs</P>
<P>        Insurance is a very competitive business and the price you pay</P>
<P>     for your homeowners insurance can vary by hundreds of dollars,</P>
<P>     depending on the insurance company you buy your policy from.</P>
<P>     Companies offer several types of discounts, but they don't offer</P>
<P>     the same discount or the same amount of discount in all states.</P>
<P>     That's why you should ask your agent or company representative</P>
<P>     about any discounts available to you.  Here are some things to</P>
<P>     consider when buying homeowners insurance.</P>
<P>     1. Be sure to shop around.</P>
<P>        It'll take a few phone calls, but they could save you a good</P>
<P>     sum of money.  Ask your friends, check the yellow pages or call</P>
<P>     your state insurance department (phone numbers are on the back page</P>
<P>     of this brochure).  Also check consumer guides, insurance agents</P>
<P>     and companies.  This will give you an idea of price ranges and tell</P>
<P>     you which companies or agents have the lowest prices.  But don't</P>
<P>     consider price alone.</P>
<P>        The insurer you select should offer both a fair price and</P>
<P>     excellent service.  Quality service may cost a bit more, but it</P>
<P>     provides added conveniences, so talk to a number of insurers to get</P>
<P>     a feeling for the type of service they give.  Ask them what they</P>
<P>     would do to lower your costs.  Check the financial ratings of the</P>
<P>     companies, too.  Then, when you've narrowed the field to three</P>
<P>     insurers, get price quotes.</P>
<P>     2. Raise your deductible.</P>
<P>        Deductibles are the amount of money you have to pay toward a</P>
<P>     loss before your insurance company starts to pay according to the</P>
<P>     terms of your policy.  Deductibles on homeowners policies typically</P>
<P>     start at $250.  By increasing your deductible to $500, you could</P>
<P>     save up to 12 percent; $1,000, up to 24 percent; $2,500, up to 30</P>
<P>     percent; and $5,000, up to 37 percent, depending, of course, on</P>
<P>     your insurance company.</P>
<P>     3. Buy your home and auto policies from the same insurer.</P>
<P>        Some companies that sell homeowners, auto and liability</P>
<P>     coverage will take 5 to 15 percent off your premium if you buy two</P>
<P>     or more policies from them.</P>
<P>     4. When you buy a home...</P>
<P>        Consider how much insuring it will cost.  Because a new home's</P>
<P>     electrical, heating and plumbing systems and overall structure are</P>
<P>     likely to be in better shape than those of an older house, insurers</P>
<P>     may offer you a discount of 8 to 15 percent if your house is new.</P>
<P>        Check its construction, too.  Brick, because of its resistance</P>
<P>     to wind damage is better in the East; frame, because of its</P>
<P>     resistance to earthquake damage, better in the West.  Choosing</P>
<P>     wisely could cut your premium by 5 to 15 percent.</P>
<P>        Avoiding areas that are prone to floods can save you $400 or</P>
<P>     so a year for flood insurance.  Homeowners insurance does not cover</P>
<P>     flood-related damage.  If you do buy a house in a flood-prone area,</P>
<P>     you'll have to buy a flood insurance policy, too.</P>
<P>        Does your town have full-time or volunteer fire service?  And</P>
<P>     is your house close to a hydrant or fire station?  The closer your</P>
<P>     house is to firefighters and their equipment, the lower your</P>
<P>     premium will be.</P>
<P>     5. Insure your house, not the land.</P>
<P>        The land under your house isn't at risk from theft, windstorm,</P>
<P>     fire and the other perils covered in your homeowners policy.  So</P>
<P>     don't include its value in deciding how much homeowners insurance</P>
<P>     to buy.  If you do, you'll pay a higher premium than you should.</P>
<P>     6. Beef up your home security.</P>
<P>        You can usually get discounts of at least 5 percent for a</P>
<P>     smoke detector, burglar alarm, or dead-bolt locks.  Some companies</P>
<P>     offer to cut your premium by as much as 15 or 20 percent if you</P>
<P>     install a sophisticated sprinkler system and a fire and burglar</P>
<P>     alarm that rings at the police station or other monitoring</P>
<P>     facility.  These systems aren't cheap and not every system</P>
<P>     qualifies for the discount.  Before you buy such a system, find out</P>
<P>     what kind your insurer recommends and how much the device would</P>
<P>     cost and how much you'd save on premiums.</P>
<P>     7. Stop smoking.</P>
<P>        Smoking accounts for more than 23,000 residential fires a</P>
<P>     year.  That's why some insurers offer to reduce premiums if all the</P>
<P>     residents in a house don't smoke.</P>
<P>     8. Once you retire...</P>
<P>        Retired people stay at home more and spot fires sooner than</P>
<P>     working people.  Retired people have more time for maintaining</P>
<P>     their homes, too.  If you're at least 55 years old and retired, you</P>
<P>     may qualify for a discount of up to 10 percent at some companies.</P>
<P>     9. See if you can get group coverage.</P>
<P>        Alumni and business associations often work out an insurance</P>
<P>     package with an insurance company, which includes a discount for</P>
<P>     association members.  Ask your association's director if an insurer</P>
<P>     is offering a discount on homeowners insurance to you and your</P>
<P>     fellow graduates or colleagues.</P>
<P>     10. Stay loyal to your insurer.</P>
<P>         If you've kept your coverage with a company for several</P>
<P>     years, you may receive special consideration.  Several insurers</P>
<P>     will reduce their premiums by 5 percent if you stay with them for</P>
<P>     three to five years and by 10 percent if you remain a policyholder</P>
<P>     for six years or more.</P>
<P>     11. Compare the limits in your policy and the value of your</P>
<P>         possessions at least once a year.</P>
<P>         You want your policy to cover any major purchases or additions</P>
<P>     to your home.  But you don't want to spend money for coverage you</P>
<P>     don't need.  If your five-year-old fur coat is no longer worth the</P>
<P>     $20,000 you paid for it, you'll want to reduce your floater and</P>
<P>     pocket the difference.</P>
<P>     12. If you're in a government plan...</P>
<P>         If you live in a high-risk area --- say, one that is</P>
<P>     especially vulnerable to coastal storms, fires, or crime --- and</P>
<P>     have been buying your homeowners insurance through a government</P>
<P>     plan, you should check with an insurance agent or company</P>
<P>     representative.  You may find that there are steps you can take</P>
<P>     that would allow you to buy insurance at a lower price in the</P>
<P>     private market.</P>
<P>.</P>

*******************************<P>SAVING MONEY ON AUTO INSURANCE <P>
</H2>
<P>  Auto insurance premiums are based on a number of factors--including the  model of the car, miles driven, where the car is garaged, and the driving  record of the owner. A driver who owns an expensive car and has a number  of traffic violations has to pay more for insurance coverage than a person  who has a less expensive model and drives cautiously.    But there are several ways car owners can save money on their auto  insurance premiums. In fact, the auto insurance industry encourages car  owners to take some personal control over the cost of their auto insurance.  Encouraging drivers to take responsibility for driving safely can reduce  the number of accidents and fatalities and lower premiums.    <P>ASK FOR HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES. By requesting higher deductibles on collision  and comprehensive (fire and theft) coverage, car owners can reduce their  total premium substantially.   <P> DROP COLLISION AND/OR COMPREHENSIVE. On older cars worth less than $1,000,  carrying collision and comprehensive may not make economic sense. A minor  accident may result in a claim that exceeds the "book value" of the vehicle,  which is the amount the insured would receive.   <P> BUY A LOW PROFILE CAR. Cars that are expensive to repair or are prime  targets for thieves cost more to insure. Write the Insurance Institute  for Highway Safety, 1005 N.  Glebe Rd., Arlington, Virginia 22201, and  ask for the Highway Loss Data Institute chart that lists frequency of  theft by car model.   <P> COMPARISON SHOP. Insurance premiums can vary from insurer to insurer  but car owners should select an insurance company that provides excellent  service along with a fair price.   <P> DISCOUNTS AND CREDITS. These apply to specific coverages, and the  amounts vary by insurer and state.   <P> *  Air Bag/Automatic Seat Belt Discount. A discount of up to 30  percent on medical coverage may be offered for vehicles equipped with  one or more air bags or automatic seat belts.    <P>*  Anti-Theft Devices. Car owners who install a device on their  automobile to deter its theft are granted a discount ranging from 5 to  15 percent on their comprehensive coverage.    <P>*  Good-Driver Discount. Drivers who have had no traffic violations  or chargeable accidents, usually within the past three to five years,  receive a discount when renewing their auto insurance policy with the  same insurer.   <P> *  Car-Pool Driver. By agreeing to ride in a car pool, thus reducing  the number of miles driven each year, drivers can get a discount of 10  to 20 percent off their premiums.    <P>*  Good Student Discount. Believing that students who earn good grades  are more likely to drive safely, insurers offer students under 25 years  old who maintain at least a B average or make the honor roll or dean's list  a discount of up to 25 percent.    <P>*  Mature Driver Discount. Depending on the number of miles driven each year,  drivers who are 50 years of age or older may qualify for discounts of 10 to 20  percent off their premium.    <P>*  Multi-Car Discount. Insurers will give car owners 15 to 20 percent  off their auto insurance premiums if they insure two or more cars with the  same insurer.   <P> *  Multi-Policy Discount. Many insurers offer a discount or credit of  5 to 15 percent if they insure both the house and car with the same  insurance company.<P>  *  AIR BAGS.  The insurance industry successfully took the fight to have  air bags installed in cars all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. With more  air bags in cars, fewer people will be killed and injured each year, which  will result in lower claims costs and eventually help to reduce auto insurance  premiums.    <P>*  CHILD RESTRAINTS.  Insurers produced videos, publications and pubic  safety messages to help convince state legislatures to mandate that children  be properly restrained in autos. All 50 states and the District of Columbia  have child-restraint laws, which have saved thousands of children from death  and injury.    <P>*  DRUNK DRIVERS. Anti-drunk driving organizations and the insurance  industry have raised the awareness of the American people to the terrible  waste caused by drunk driving. Alcohol-related deaths as a percent of all  traffic deaths have fallen from 54 percent in 1984 to 44 percent in 1993.    <P>*  SEAT-BELT USAGE.  Buckle Up programs were funded and produced by  insurers, state and federal governments to get drivers and passengers to  use their seat belts. With more Americans using seat belts, thousands of  people will not die or have major injuries from accidents.    <P>*  RECOVERY OF STOLEN VEHICLES. The National Insurance Crime Bureau  (NICB) played a pivotal role in cracking the bombing at New York's World  Trade Center in February 1993. Nearly 1,000 insurers support the NICB, which  each year identifies and retrieves hundreds of thousands of stolen vehicles  valued at about a billion dollars.    <P>*  MOTORCYCLE DEATHS AND INJURIES. The industry has worked to enact state  laws to require all motorcyclists to wear protective helmets. Research, funded  by the insurance industry, shows conclusively that motorcyclists who wear  helmets have less severe head injuries when involved in an accident.  <P><HR>

<H4>FROZEN, BROKEN WATER PIPES CAN BE HOMEOWNER NIGHTMARE</H4>We don't often think of damage from frozen and broken water pipes as being on the same scale as a natural disaster, but damage from water is the most prevalent -- yet least recognized -- catastrophe. In fact, frozen and broken water pipes rank No. 2 behind hurricanes in terms of both the number of homes damaged and the amount of claim costs in the U.S.<P>Damage from frozen and broken water pipes can be a homeowner's nightmare. When a pipe bursts, water gushes from the pipe like a fire hydrant, turning a basement into a lake within minutes. Water from frozen and broken pipes causes the most damage while people are away from home, because the plumbing can rupture and water can run unnoticed for several days. Repairs of around $50,000 are common due to water's wrath.<P>Frozen and broken water pipes are a significant cause of loss across the nation -- including the Rocky Mountain Region of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. Damage can include soaked and ruined drywall. Wallpaper turns moldy. Kitchen cabinets warp, and carpet and draperies can be ruined. Photo albums, paperwork, antiques, furniture and clothing also can be destroyed. Sometimes homes have to be gutted because mold and mildew cover every inch from floor to ceiling.<P>Unlike hurricanes, frozen and broken water pipes are preventable. Efforts to prevent pipes from breaking in your home will save you from the nightmares of water damage and help reduce the enormous insurance claims that result. Policyholders share the financial burden of frozen and broken water pipes through increased homeowners insurance rates. Obviously, preventing broken water pipes is in your best interest.<P>According to the Western Insurance Information Service, there are five easy things you can do to protect your home from frozen and broken water pipes:<OL><LI>Disconnect all garden hoses and other outside hose connections. If possible, use an indoor valve to shut off and drain water from pipes leading to outside faucets.<LI>Insulate all exposed pipes located in your basement, under your home, on outside walls or in attics. For pipes with northern exposures, use heat tape according to the manufacturer's instructions. (Improper usage may cause a fire.)<LI>Set the thermostat to at least 55 degrees even when your home is vacant or unoccupied during the winter. If you plan to be away during cold-weather months, have someone regularly check your home to make sure it's staying warm enough to prevent freezing.<LI>Winterize sprinkler systems according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Blowing out excess water with a compressor may be the best way to prevent frozen and broken pipes. If you have a swamp cooler, winterize it by disconnecting the water source and clearing the line.<LI>Very important is knowing how to shut off the water supply if a pipe bursts. Quick action can minimize damage.</OL><P>Taking these few precautions before the next freeze sets in may save your home from the devastating effects of frozen and broken water pipes.<P>Should you ever need to file an insurance claim, Western Insurance Information Service provides a helpful brochure free of charge to help walk you through the process. To request your free copy of "How to File an Insurance Claim," please write to Western Insurance Information Service, 6565 S. Dayton St., Suite 2400, Englewood, CO 80111.<P>

<P><H3>  How to File an Insurance Claim</H3>
  Knowing just what to do when you have a claim can help you get the
  best value for your insurance dollars.
  Insurance Companies pay more than $75 billion each year in claims
  from policyholders.  Those claims result from losses suffered
  during fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, robberies, auto accidents, dog
  bites, falls and a host of other traumatic incidents.
  Instead of waiting until an accident strikes you or your family,
  save time, money and anxiety by doing three important things now:<P>
   *  Look through your policies to see what is - and isn't - covered.
      The coverages and exclusions in your insurance policies can differ
      significantly from those of your friends.  The best advice is to
      understand your policies before you have a claim.<P>
   *  Ask your local insurance agent or company representative to
      explain anything you don't understand.<P>
   *  Read and keep this brochure to learn exactly what steps to
      follow when you have a claim.<P>
   *  If you have an accident, be sure to talk to your insurance
      company before you talk to a lawyer.  The vast majority of claims
      are settled without a lawyer.<P>
   *  If you decide you need a lawyer, be sure you establish what his
      or her fee arrangement is.<P>
   *  Remember that when you hire a lawyer, you lose your ability to
      represent yourself with the insurance company.<P>
<B>  Auto Insurance Claims</B><P>
  Taking the time now to review the steps you should follow after an
  auto accident will help reduce the anxiety surrounding the incident
  and avoid costly and time-consuming mistakes.<P>
 <B> Before You Have a Claim</B><P>
  Be sure you know the answers to these questions before you have to
  file a claim:<P>
   *  How much liability insurance do you have?  This coverage pays for
      damage you cause to another vehicle or injuries to other people.<BR>
   *  Does your state have no-fault insurance?  What coverages does it
      provide?<BR>
   *  If you have collision and/or comprehensive coverage, what is
      your deductible (the amount you've agreed to pay out of your own
      pocket if you suffer a loss)?<BR><P>
 <B> At the Scene</B><P>
   *  Stop your car and get help for the injured.
      Have someone call the police of highway patrol.  Tell them how many
      people were injured and the types of injuries.  The police can then
      notify the nearest medical unit.  Give whatever help you can to the
      injured but avoid moving anyone so you don't aggravate the injury.
      Covering an injured person with a blanket and making that person
      comfortable usually is as much as you can do.<BR>
   *  Provide the police with whatever information they require.
      Ask the investigating officer where you can obtain a copy of the
      police report, which you may need to support any claim you submit
      to your insurance company.<BR>
   *  Try to protect the accident scene.
      Take reasonable steps to protect your car from further damage, such
      as setting up flares, getting the car off the road and calling a
      tow truck.  If necessary, have the car towed to a repair shop.  But
      remember, your insurance company probably will want to have an
      adjuster inspect it and appraise the damage before you order repair
      work done.<BR>
   *  Make notes.
      Keep a pad and pencil in your glove compartment.  Write down the
      names and addresses of all drivers and passengers involved in the
      accident.  Also note the license number, make and model of each car
      involved and record the driver's license number and insurance
      identification of each driver.  Record the names and addresses of
      as many witnesses as possible, as well as the names and badge
      numbers of police officers or other emergency personnel.  If you
      run into an unattended vehicle or object, try to find the owner.
      If you can't, leave a note containing your name, address and phone
      number.<P>
 <B> Filing Your Claim</B><P>
  If your car is involved in an accident, if it is damaged by fire,
  flood or vandalism, or if it is stolen, put your insurance to work
  for you by following these steps in filing your claim:<P>
   *  Phone your insurance agent or a local company representative.
      Do it as soon as possible even if you're far from home and even if
      someone else caused the accident.  Ask your agent how to proceed
      and what forms or documents will be needed to support your claim.
      Your company may require a &quot;proof of loss&quot; form, as well as
      documents relating to your claim, such as medical and auto repair
      bills and a copy of the police report.<BR>
   *  Supply the information your insurer needs.
      Cooperate with your insurance company in its investigation,
      settlement or defense of any claim, and turn over to the company
      immediately copies of any legal papers you receive in connection
      with your loss.  Your insurer will represent you if a claim is
      brought against you and defend you if you are sued.<BR>
   *  Keep records of your expenses.
      Expenses you incur as a result of an automobile accident may be
      reimbursed under your policy.  Remember, for example, that your no-
      fault insurer usually will pay your medical and hospital expenses,
      and possibly such other costs as lost wages and at least part of
      your costs if you have to hire a temporary housekeeper.<BR>
   *  Keep copies of your paper work.
      Store copies of all paper work in your own files.  You may need to
      refer to it later.<BR><P>
 <B> Home Insurance Claims</B><P>
  Those crumbs in your toaster start a fire in your kitchen.... Little
  Suzy from next door falls out of the tree house in your backyard....
  A tornado damages your home, forcing you to move temporarily to a
  motel....<P>
  Your homeowners policy provides insurance coverage for each of
  these situations and many more because it is a &quot;package&quot; of
  insurance for (1) your house, furniture and personal belongings,
  (2) your ability to others and (3) additional living expenses you
  may incur if our home is severely damaged.<P>
 <B> Before You Have A Claim</B><P>
  Be sure you know the answers to these questions before you have to
  file a claim:<P>
   *  Is your home insured for at least 80 percent of its replacement
      value?  (If you have less coverage, you may not be fully reimbursed
      for any partial damage.)<BR>
   *  Are your belongings insured for actual cash value (replacement
      cost of an item minus depreciation) or replacement cost (the amount
      it would take to replace the item at current prices)?  Most
      policies provide compensation on an actual cash value basis rather
      than a replacement cost basis.  Talk with your agent to determine
      whether purchasing replacement cost coverage is worth the extra
      premium.<BR>
   *  What liability coverages are provided in your homeowners policy?
      If you have questions, now is the time to ask your insurance
      representative for answers.<BR>
   *  What amount of medical payments coverage is included in your
      homeowners policy?  This type of coverage pays for medical expenses
      of a guest injured in your home, regardless of fault.  A medical
      payment claim begins, as do others, with a call to your insurance
      representative.<P>
<B>  Filing Your Claim</B><P>
  Here's what to do when you have a home insurance claim:<P>
   *  Report any burglary or theft to police.<BR>
   *  Phone your agent or company immediately.  Insurance policies
      place a time limit on filing claims.  Ask questions.
      Am I covered? Does my claim exceed my deductible?  (Your deductible
      is the amount of loss you agree to pay yourself when you buy a policy.)<BR>
   *  Follow up your call with an explanation of what happened in
      writing, at the request of your agent or company.<BR>
   *  Make temporary repairs and take other steps to protect your
      property from further damage.  Save receipts for what you spend and
      submit them to your insurance company for reimbursement.<BR>
   *  Prepare a list of lost or damaged articles.  Save receipts from
      any additional living expenses you incur if your home is so
      severely damaged that you have to find other accommodations while
      repairs are being made.<BR>
   *  Provide needed information to the insurance representative
      assigned to handle your claim.<BR>
   *  Talk things over with your agent and adjuster if you are
      dissatisfied with the settlement offer.  Check your policy to see
      what settlement steps it outlines.

<H4>HIGHER SPEED LIMITS DON'T HAVE TO MEAN INCREASED INSURANCE PREMIUMS</H4>Some motorists are worried.  Now that the federal government has decided to allow each state to set its own speed limits -- or do away with limits altogether -- some people are predicting that auto insurance premiums will climb just as fast as the speed limits do.  Well, you can breathe easy, because that just won't happen.<P>According to Western Insurance Information Service, increased speed limits can't have an immediate effect on auto insurance premiums, because insurers base premiums on claims experience.  It will take at least a year to collect enough data to determine if increased speeds are causing additional and/or more costly insured traffic crashes, or if speed has no effect at all.<P>Regardless of how well or poorly motorists handle increased speeds, it's important to remember that insurers also use numerous other factors to calculate an auto insurance premium.  That's why an unmarried, 17-year-old boy who lives in downtown Denver probably would pay more for auto insurance than a married, 35-year-old woman who lives in Lusk, Wyoming -- no matter what the speed limits are.  <P>Some of the factors insurers consider when calculating auto insurance premiums include:<UL><LI><STRONG>Where the insured vehicle owner lives</STRONG> (for example, rural vs. urban area, downtown vs. suburban area, theft and crash claims experience specific to that area, etc.);<LI><STRONG>The driving record, marital status, sex, and age of the driver(s) of the insured vehicle</STRONG> (for example, a DUI conviction indicates a high-risk driver, married drivers tend to be safer drivers thanunmarried ones, males are involved in more traffic crashes and fatalities than females, teens are involved in more traffic crashes than people in their 40s, etc.);<LI><STRONG>The type of insured vehicle</STRONG> (for example, motorcycle vs. private passenger car, fancy sports car that is expensive to repair vs. a standard sedan that costs less to repair, theft experience, etc.);<LI><STRONG>How the insured vehicle is used</STRONG> (for example, driven mostly to and from work vs. driven often on business, the number of miles driven annually, etc.);<LI><STRONG>The number and types of safety features included with the insured vehicle</STRONG> (for example, in 1994, air bags prevented 527 deaths, seat belts saved 9,175 lives, child safety seats saved 308 lives, motorcycle helmets saved 527 lives, anti-theft devices reduced auto thefts, etc.).</UL><P>If motorists aren't able to drive safely at higher speeds, the effect of increased speed limits will become a factor insurers have to consider when calculating auto insurance premiums.  However, it's important to note that if speed-related traffic crashes were to increase in Provo, Utah, insurance premiums in only that area could be affected, provided no trends were detected statewide.  Likewise, if Las Cruces, New Mexico, were the only area in that state that didn't see an increase in speed-related traffic crashes, insurance premiums could rise throughout the state, with the exception of that area.<P>In other words, you, the driver of the insured vehicle, will help determine whether or not higher speed limits will affect auto insurance premiums.<P>Looking for ways to lower your auto insurance costs?  Western Insurance Information Service provides a helpful brochure free of charge. To request your free copy of "Nine Ways to Lower Your Auto Insurance Costs," please write to Western Insurance Information Service, 6565 S. Dayton St., Suite 2400, Englewood, CO 80111.<P>

<H4>COVERING KIDS AT COLLEGE: CHECK YOUR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE BEFORE SENDING STUDENTS TO CAMPUS</H4>Every year thousands of students head off to college with their computers, stereos, televisions and calculators. But what if these items were stolen, damaged by fire or vandalized?  Would your homeowners policy provide enough coverage to replace your student's personal possessions even if he or she is away at college?<P>Unfortunately many students are victims of these disasters every year. So before your child leaves home, it makes sense to check your homeowners insurance policy to ensure that everything they take with them to college is covered.<P>Typically, a homeowner's policy covers property away from home, up to a limit of 10 percent of the contents coverage. For example, if your home is insured for $100,000, the contents are covered for half that amount which amounts to $50,000. Therefore, the property away from home is covered for $5,000 -- minus the policy's deductible.<P>But even though you have coverage, you still must take into consideration whether your child lives in a dormitory or an off-campus apartment. If your child lives in a dormitory and is under 26 years old, then most of the students' personal belongings are covered. Keep in mind that high-ticket items such as jewelry require additional coverage in the form of a "personal articles floater."  Computers may also need more coverage by purchasing a "rider" to protect it in campus dormitories.<P>However if your child is living in an off-campus apartment, your homeowners policy probably will not apply. Many insurance companies do not consider the student a part of the household any longer when he or she moves into an apartment. You may need to purchase a separate renters insurance policy which is fairly inexpensive and provides property and liability protection.<P>To determine if you have enough coverage for your children's personal possessions at college, you should consult your insurance agent or company representative.<P>The Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS) also offers the following tips for students on how to protect their property in their dormitory room or in their apartment:<P><UL><LI> Always lock your door even if you go out for just a few minutes. Thieves will take any opportunity to get in your room and take something.<LI>Engrave all your possessions with an identification number such as your drivers license or social security number. Thieves are less prone to stealing marked items because they are difficult to sell. And if stolen, marked items will help police identify recovered property.<LI> Keep your cash or valuable items such as jewelry stored in a safe which is usually provided by dormitories.<LI>Always close your curtains, lock your windows, and arrange your room so that the stereo and television are not on display. Don't give thieves a chance to see what you have.<LI> Be selective about giving out your room or telephone number or information to friends about where you keep your valuables or cash and when you won't be home. Usually criminals and victims know each other and the information is passed on inadvertently.<LI>Take extra precaution to safeguard your valuables during vacation as most thefts occur at this time.<LI>Keep an inventory of all your possessions in the event of a theft or fire. Store this list in a safe deposit box or fire proof box. An inventory will make it easier if you file a claim.</UL><P>If you would like to receive more information about renters insurance or how to take an inventory of your possessions, WIIS has the following brochures available entitled, "Here Today, Gone Tomorrow," "Renters Insurance: A Wise Choice," "Tenants Insurance Basics," and "Taking Inventory."  Please send a self-addressed stamped (52 cents) business envelope with your request to Western Insurance Information Service, 3530 Wilshire Blvd. Suite 1610, Los Angeles, CA 90010.<P>Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues. For more information or how to arrange for a speaker, please contact us at (800) 397-1679.<P>

<h2>Consumer Mistakes</h2>

<P> 

 

     Consumers can cut costs and better protect themselves financially by
avoiding common insurance mistakes when buying life, disability, home, and
auto insurance, says Jeanne Hogarth, consumer economist with Cornell
Cooperative Extension.<P>
     For home and auto insurance, check to see if deductibles are as high
as you can safely manage.  The deductible is the portion of the expense the
consumer pays before insurance kicks in; if your auto deductible is $500,
you pay the first $500 for repairs, and insurance pays costs above that.<P>
     "When you carry a higher deductible on your auto insurance, you
generally pay a lower premium," Hogarth says.  Over time, many consumers
save money because the lower premiums more than offset the cost of a higher
deductible.<P>
     "When was the last time you made a claim against auto or homeowner's
insurance?" Hogarth asks.  "If you make claims only rarely, if at all,
you're better off with a high deductible and low premium payment."
    Remember, though, your savings account must, at all times, have the
amount of the deductible in it to pay for any auto and home repairs the
insurance won't meet.<P>
     Do you have enough disability insurance?  Many workers, especially
young ones, do not, Hogarth says.
     "Consumers are fairly conscientious about carrying life insurance to
protect their families," she says.  "But many people have inadequate
disability insurance."  Disability insurance can help meet expenses and
carry your family through an extended time of financial jeopardy, should
the income-earner become unable to work.<P>
     "Younger workers, in fact, are more liable to become disabled than to
die, so their disability coverage is as important as life insurance, if not
more important."
     Many workers already have some form of disability coverage in the form
of sick leave policies from employers and Social Security disability
payments.  But such coverage can't be relied on to protect your family if
you become disabled.  Sick leave is usually short term, and Social Security
coverage may not kick in until you've been unable to work for six months or
longer.<P>
     "And Social Security payments are not generous," Hogarth points out.
     To protect yourself and your family from severe financial jeopardy,
non-retired workers should have a good disability insurance program that
will cover their current expenses -- mortgage payments and any school
tuition bills as well as food and other basics -- in case of disability.
     To find a good disability insurance policy, ask your employer if any
group policies are available and check consumer product rating magazines
and your state insurance commission.
     While younger workers may not be carrying adequate disability
insurance, retired workers may be carrying too much life insurance, Hogarth
says.<P>
     "If you are at or near retirement age, you don't necessarily have to
worry about replacing income for your family, in case of your death," she
says.  "If you have saved for retirement, you no longer need to count on
insurance that will replace a missed paycheck."
     For older people whose children are grown, mortgages are paid, and
major expenses, other than health care, have already been met, life
insurance may no longer be a priority.<P>
     "Consumers might save money by making sure that their retirement plans
have survivor clauses to care for their spouses in case the retiree dies
and reducing whatever money they are spending on life insurance," Hogarth
says.
    There are two instances in which the elderly might want to continue
life insurance payments: if they have a family business, the life insurance
policy could be continued to pay estate taxes on the business, and life
insurance could be used to help pay expenses for grandchildren with special
health needs.<P>
    Otherwise, Hogarth says, older consumers should ask themselves why they
are still paying premiums for life insurance which is, after all, a hedge
against premature death and loss of earned income.

<H2> Use Life Insurance to Maximize <BR>Post-
Retirement Pension Income </H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
<STRONG>DENVER -</STRONG> Would you buy car insurance knowing in advance you would be required to continue to pay premiums on the policy even if you sold the vehicle?

<P>
The answer to this question is, clearly, no. However, for those planning to fund a portion of their retirement through pension benefits, there are remarkable, and unfortunate similarities.  Unless your spouse signs a waiver, Congress may require that up to 20 percent of your post-retirement pension benefit go toward providing continued benefits to your spouse should you die first - essentially a life insurance policy.

<P>
"There's absolutely nothing wrong with this approach - unless you are concerned with maximizing your post-retirement income, and 90 percent of the  people I've talked to over the years list this as a primary financial objective," said Mandell Winter, Jr., MBA, ChFC, CLU, and an academic associate with the Denver-based College for Financial Planning.  "What's more, the loss of income can be pointless, because, should the spouse precede the retiree in death, the reduction in benefit remains, but there is nobody to whom the additional pre-paid benefits can be transferred.  It's like buying car insurance, then getting rid of the car but continuing to pay insurance," Winter said.

<P>
He said the most obvious way to avoid paying the 20-percent pension premium is to have the retiree's spouse waive survivor benefits. This establishes a single life annuity, and the retiree may receive the maximum amount of post-retirement income because the pension plan is, in effect, now insuring only one life instead of two.  However, if the retiree dies first, the spouse is left without any pension income.

<P>
"Essentially, you have two choices," Winter said.  "You can take a benefit that only pays as long as you live, but will give you the highest pension income;  or you can take the benefit that pays less, but pays your spouse only if he or she outlives you."

<P>
The best way around this dilemma is life insurance, purchased prior to retirement. Looking at the post-retirement reduction in benefits essentially as an insurance premium, the question becomes, do you pay it before or after retirement?  "Most people can handle a reduction in income better before retirement than after retirement," Winter said.

<P>
"The purpose of life insurance is to allow you to take the higher pension payments as long as you live," Winter said.  "If you die before your spouse, the life insurance will replace the lost pension income.  On the other hand, if your spouse should die first, you are not stuck with a reduced pension and no beneficiary.  You can simply cash in the insurance policy and take the accumulated proceeds as either a lump-sum distribution or an annuity."

<P>
Winter recommends discussing your specific situation with a Certified Financial Planner licensee or insurance industry professional to ensure all pertinent information is evaluated to maximize retirement income.

<H4>IS YOUR HOME FIRE SAFE?</H4><P>The fires that annually rage through California destroying thousands of homes remind residents that they need to be prepared for any disaster. To carefully safeguard your home against the threat of a fire, the Western Insurance Information Service (WIIS) suggests that homeowners follow these guidelines:<P><UL><LI>Clear the space around your home. Clear brush areas from 100 to 200 feet (500 feet on sheer slopes is recommended as flames will shoot up faster). This can reduce the risk of fire by 50 percent. It will also provide room for firefighters to battle the blaze. Also be sure to remove dead leaves and brush from around your home and on the roof and gutters regularly. <P><LI>Landscape the area around your home with fire-resistant plants. For example, ice plants or citrus trees withstand high temperatures and do not support open flames when ignited. Consult a nursery or your local fire department about all types of fire-retardant plans. Also place native shrubs and trees at least 10 feet apart, and prune branches on trees taller than 18 feet within six feet of the ground.<P><LI>Use non-combustible building materials. A non-combustible or fire-resistant shingle roof can prevent against flaming wood shingles or other debris carried by the wind. Also seal the eaves under your roof to prevent flying embers from lodging on your home. Decking should be concrete, tile or protected with fire-resistant coating. Install fire-resistant shutters or shades instead of drapes that can easily catch on fire.<P><LI>Check the area around your home for any fire hazards. Place woodpiles and propane tanks at least 30 feet away from the home. Cover chimneys or stovepipe outlets with a non-flammable screen of 1/2 inch or smaller mesh. <P><LI>Have an adequate water supply handy for firefighting. You can do a number of things such as installing a water tank and water pump, buying a pool pump or storing extra trash cans filled with water. You may also consider buying a fire hose as regular garden hoses may not be enough to battle high blazes or able to withstand extreme temperatures.<P><LI>Make sure there are accessible roads to your home. Your driveway must be at least 15 feet wide and have enough turnaround space for emergency vehicles.<P></UL><H4>CHECK YOUR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE</H4>Unfortunately, thousands of homeowners affected by fires discover that they're underinsured. Many homeowners do not periodically review and update their policy to include changes or additions to their home, inflation rates or new building code requirements. Also, some homeowners base the amount of their insurance on the current market value of the home instead of the cost to replace their home which is a more accurate figure. So homeowners should check their insurance by using these guidelines:<P><UL><LI>Base your insurance on the cost to replace your home and not the current market value. Consult your real estate agent, appraiser or an architect for average building costs in your area to estimate the cost of your home. The average cost of a home in California is between $100 to $300 per square foot. Also factor in the design and the quality of materials used for your home (do you have hardwood floors or marble counters?)<P><LI>Have enough coverage for the contents of your home. Normally, the contents of your home are covered for up to 50% of your overall homeowner's coverage. Check if you have actual cash value or replacement cost coverage on your contents. Replacement cost coverage is your best bet because your insurer will replace damaged contents with new ones rather than paying you for the current value of your possessions. If you have guaranteed replacement cost coverage, check your policy to make sure there are no limits placed on this coverage. Finally, you should buy additional coverage in the form of "floaters" for high-ticket items such as computers, jewelry, collectibles, furs or artwork since most insurers place a limit on how much they will pay for these items (usually $2,500).<P><LI>Take an inventory of all your possessions and keep it off the premises. The hardest part of filing a claim after a fire is remembering what was lost and how much it was worth. Your inventory list should describe the item, the date and amount of purchase as well as brand names and model numbers. It's also a good idea to save receipts. You may also want to videotape or take photos to make the claims process easier.<P><LI>If your home is insured by a state-offered FAIR Plan, you should talk to you agent about purchasing a "wrap-around policy" from another insurer to cover any gaps in coverage.<P><LI>You can possibly lower your insurance premium rates by taking preventative measures such as installing a non-combustible roof, clearing the brush around your home or landscaping with fire-retardant plants. Consult your agent or broker for details.<P><LI>Review your policy today. Make sure it includes increases in inflation, costs for current building codes or any changes to your home such as an additional room or newly remodeled kitchen -- or else they won't be covered. If your home is in a high-risk area such as on a hillside or brush area, ask your agent or broker about special coverages such as "code ordinance coverage" which pays for new building code requirements.</UL><P>WIIS offers a number of brochures on fire prevention, home insurance and how to take a home inventory. If you would like copies of these publications, please send a self-addressed stamped (52 cents) business envelope to Western Insurance Information Service, 3530 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1610, Los Angeles, CA 90010.<P>Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues.

<H4>CONDO OWNER'S CHECKLIST</H4><P>Condominium insurance is a special insurance designed to fit the specific needs of condo owners. Condo and renters insurance are similar because they both provide personal property and liability protection. However, condo owners need to take into consideration additional coverage for the building based on their condominium association's master policy and coverage.<P><H4>CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION MASTER POLICY</H4><P>Your condominium association will insure the building and its common elements based on one of two approaches: 1) bare walls, or 2) single entity.<P>"Bare walls" means that the association will insure only the building including walls, the roof, floors, elevators, etc. The association is not responsible for insuring anything inside your unit such as appliances cabinets, carpeting, wall paper, interior partitions, plumbing, wiring, and bathroom fixtures, among others. Therefore, the condo owner is responsible for repairing and maintaining everything in his or her unit.<P>"Single entity" means that the association will insure the building as well as certain fixtures inside your unit including carpeting, cabinets and appliances. The condo owner is only responsible for his or her personal property inside the unit and for any additions or alterations made to the original structure.<P>These approaches spell out exactly what the condo association is responsible for and what the owner is responsible for. Condo owners should first review their association's master policy to figure out how much of the unit they will be responsible for insuring. Make sure you understand who insures things like garages, sidewalks, swimming pools and other common areas, too. If you're not sure, ask your association or check the declarations and bylaws.<P>Once you have determined how much of the building you are responsible for insuring, you can figure out the additional amount of coverage you need for your unit. Your policy should cover all items not covered by the association's master policy, and any improvements you've made to the property. For example, if your association's master policy is a single entity policy, it will cover a certain dollar amount for your carpet. If you upgrade your carpet, you are responsible to insure the difference between the master policy's coverage and the value of your new carpet.<P><H4>LOSS ASSESSMENT</H4><P>Loss assessment is a unique feature of condominium insurance . Under the condo association's bylaws , each owner will be assessed a proportionate share to cover major property and liability losses. For example if the building and commonly shared areas are destroyed by an insured disaster such as a windstorm and the losses are not fully covered by the master policy, your association may assess a certain amount to all unit owners to cover the loss. Your condominium unit owners policy's loss assessment coverage would help pay for your share of these assessments. The standard coverage for loss assessment is $1,000, but higher limits may be available.<P><H4>DETERMINING HOW MUCH COVERAGE YOU NEED</H4><P>As you're evaluating how much insurance you need for your unit and possessions, keep the following questions in mind:<P><UL><LI>What is the association's responsible for insuring? What am I responsible for insuring?<LI>How much coverage do I need for loss assessment?<LI>How much coverage do I need for my possessions?<LI>Do I have replacement cost or actual cash value coverage for my possessions?<LI>Are there policy limits for my valuables? Should I purchase more coverages for those items?<LI>What does the liability coverage include?<LI>Do I need earthquake or flood coverage for my unit or possessions?</UL><P>To figure out how much coverage you need for your possessions, simply take an inventory everything you own including your television, stereo, video camera, computer, pots and pans, jewelry, collectibles, clothes, furniture, and add up the total cost. This is how much money you would need to replace everything if they were stolen or damaged. You should also include purchase dates and serial numbers, save receipts and take photographs. Some possessions such as jewelry and computers require additional coverage in the form of floaters. These items are often based on a per-category theft limit which means that your insurer will only pay a specified amount for the item if it is stolen.<P>And finally, make sure you understand exactly what your policy covers. Review it at least once a year to make sure you stay adequately covered.<P>For more information on condominium insurance or how to take an inventory of your possessions, WIIS has available the following brochures: "Insurance Sense: Renters and Condominium Insurance," and "Taking Inventory."  To receive free copies of these brochures, please send a self-addressed, stamped envelope along with your request to Western Insurance Information Service, 3530 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1610, Los Angeles, CA 90010.<P>Members of the WIIS Speakers Bureau offer free presentations on a variety of insurance and loss prevention issues.

<H4>WINTER EMERGENCIES -- DO YOU KNOW HOW TO SURVIVE THEM?</H4>

You did everything right.  You took all the customary steps to protect your home, your car and yourself from the dangers of winter cold and snow, and yet you still find yourself smack dab in the middle of a winter emergency.  Now what are you going to do?
<P>
Most important is staying calm and using common sense.  To help you rescue yourself, your car or your home, Western Insurance Information Service offers the following winter survival tips for when:
<P>
<H4>YOUR CAR IS STUCK IN SNOW</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Because you've done everything you can to protect yourself from the dangers of winter, you have a shovel and some sand, kitty litter or salt in your trunk, right?  Use the shovel to remove the snow from in front and back of all four wheels, then spread the sand, kitty litter or salt in front and back of your driving wheels.
<LI>Before you try to move your car, make sure no one is standing behind your rear wheels.  Whatever you've placed on the snow to give your wheels some traction very likely will be thrown into the air when the wheels spin.
<LI>If possible, point the front wheels straight ahead until your car is moving.  Turning the wheels increases the rolling resistance and could keep you stationary.
<LI>Don't let the wheels spin when the car isn't moving.  Spinning tires get hot and will sink your car deeper into the snow.
<LI>Depending on what your owner's manual advises, you could try to rock your car free by alternately shifting from forward to reverse.
<LI>Once you get the car moving, don't stop!  If possible, keep up your momentum with a light foot on the gas.
<LI>If none of the above gets your car moving, you're stranded.
</UL>
<P>

<H4>YOU'RE STRANDED IN YOUR AUTO</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Unless you can clearly see a safe shelter, stay with your car.  Getting lost during a winter emergency can mean death.
<LI>Turn your lights on and stay inside your car.  Don't let the engine run, especially if part of the car, such as the exhaust pipe, is buried in snow.  Carbon monoxide poisoning is a real possibility in such situations.
<LI>Stay warm by exercising as much as possible while in the car.  Wear layers of clothing to trap body heat, but remove them if you begin to perspire.  Wet clothing loses all insulating value and may lead to a subsequent chill, so change into dry clothes immediately.  If you're with another person, snuggle together to share body heat.  Never let everyone in the car sleep at the same time.
<LI>If you notice signs of frostbite or hypothermia, concentrate on keeping the trunk of the body as warm as possible, and keep the head low and the feet raised to improve circulation of the blood to the brain.  Never rub affected areas or ingest alcohol, sedatives, tranquilizers or pain killers -- they only slow body processes even more.
</UL>

<H4>YOU'RE STRANDED IN YOUR HOME</H4>
<UL>
<LI>If you use an electric space heater, be sure not to overload the circuit.  Avoid using these heaters in bathrooms or other areas where they may come in contact with water.
<LI>If you use a fuel-burning appliance, such as a kerosene heater, use only the fuel recommended by the heater manufacturer.  When you place such a heater in your bedroom, be sure there is proper ventilation to prevent a buildup of carbon monoxide.
<LI>If you use a wood stove or fireplace, be sure not to use flammable liquids to start or accelerate any fire.  Never burn charcoal, which can give off lethal amounts of carbon monoxide.  If you burn synthetic logs, follow the directions on the package.
<LI>If you have no source of conventional heat, close off all unused rooms, dress in layers of loose clothing and keep moving around.  Never use a range or an oven as a heating device, because it could produce potentially toxic fumes and other safety hazards.
</UL>

<H4>THE WATER PIPES IN YOUR HOME FREEZE OR BURST</H4>
<UL>
<LI>If you discover the pipes are frozen, don't wait for them to burst.  Take measures to thaw them immediately.  However, never try to thaw them with a blow torch or other open flame, because the pipe could conduct the heat and ignite the wall structure.  Instead, use hot water or a hand-held dryer for thawing.
<LI>If the pipes burst, turn off the water at once.  So the spilled water doesn't do more damage than it already has, clean it up immediately and remove any carpet or furniture that could be damaged further from seepage.  An insurance adjuster doesn't need to see the water, he or she just needs to see the resulting damage.
</UL>
<P>
Should your winter emergency require you to file an insurance claim or make you want to bone up on ways to prevent them from happening in the first place, Western Insurance Information Service provides free of charge two brochures that may be of help.  To request your free copies of "How to File an Insurance Claim," and "Surviving Severe Cold Weather," write to Western Insurance Information Service, 6565 South Dayton Street, Suite 2400, Englewood, Colorado 80111.

<CENTER><H2>Continuing-Care Communities Offer<BR>a New Choice in Housing Options</H2></CENTER><P><STRONG>DENVER -</STRONG> The prospect of having to move to a nursing home at some point is not an appealing thought for many older Americans.  Yet independent living is not always possible either. One increasingly popular alternative is the continuing-care retirement community.  Jan Walsh, MBA, CFP, who specializes in retirement planning at the National Endowment for Financial Education  (NEFE ) and serves on the Board of Advisors for the National Institute on Financial Issues and Services for Elders, a unit of the National Council on the Aging, Inc., provides answers to some commonly asked questions about this relatively new housing plan for older Americans.<P><BR><I>What's the difference between a continuing-care facility and a nursing home?</I><P>"Continuing-care retirement communities provide a continuum of care, generally guaranteed for a lifetime," explains Walsh.  "You may start out living independently at the community in your own unit, with only light housekeeping services.  Later you may require some medical or living assistance, such as with taking medication or dressing.  And later still you may need to move into the facility's nursing home for full-time care, either temporarily or permanently.  A good continuing-care community can make these transitions seamless."<P>Not all of the over 1,100 continuing-care retirement communities (CCRCs), sometimes called life-care communities, provide the same level of services, emphasizes Walsh.  Some facilities offer a full spectrum of services, from transportation and laundry service to extensive recreational facilities such as for golf and swimming.  Others are more modest, though most offer some recreational and social activities, meals, and transportation to local events and shopping.<P><BR><I>How expensive are CCRCs?</I><P>These facilities tend to be more expensive than traditional housing options because they guarantee lifetime care, says Walsh.  Fees vary widely, but typically range from $60,000 to $120,000 for one-time entry fees and $1,000 to $1,600 for monthly fees.  Be sure to ask what is included in the monthly fee and what you must pay extra for.  A majority of CCRCs participate in Medicare, Medicaid, or both programs.<P><BR><I>What determines the size of the fees?</I><P>"It largely depends on the type of services you buy, refundability of entrance fees, and livingarrangements," says Walsh, who outlines three basic types of services:<UL><LI><STRONG>Complete Care.</STRONG>  This guarantees housing, services, and unlimited nursing care.  Generally, it's the most expensive, but there usually are no substantial increases in monthly fees except forinflation adjustments.<LI><STRONG>Limited Care. </STRONG>  You pay for housing, services, and limited nursing care or other medical services, with additional daily rates for any medical care beyond the specified limit.<LI><STRONG>Fee for service.</STRONG>  The entrance and monthly fees generally will be lowest for this type of contract.  They cover only basic shelter and services.  Access to nursing care is guaranteed, but you pay market rates if you use the service.</UL><P><BR><I>Is the entrance fee refundable if I decide to leave after a few months or if I die unexpectedly?</I><P>That depends on the contract, says Walsh.  Newer CCRCs usually will refund a portion of the entrance fees, from 50% to 90%, if the person moves.  In the event of death, a portion may be refunded to the heirs.  <P><BR><I>Who makes the decision of what level of care I need?</I><P>This should be spelled out in the contract.  Often it is a joint decision made by you, family members, medical advisors, and the CCRC's manager.  Some state laws provide guidelines as well.<P><BR><I>How do I know a CCRC is right for me?</I><P>Walsh believes CCRCs are most appealing to single people who have no family or who don't want to burden a family with their care and to married couples, who want to remain close to each other even if one moves into the facility's nursing home.  CCRCs also are appealing to people who want to live independently yet have guaranteed access to medical care.<P>Money is clearly another factor, since one needs the financial resources to pay the hefty entrance and monthly fees.  Also, although the number of CCRCs is growing, they are not nearly as widespread as nursing homes.  Their greatest concentrations are in California, Florida, and Pennsylvania.  Therefore, if you must move to another state to live in a CCRC, Walsh advises you to see how that state's laws might affect your will, taxes, and other estate and financial planning issues.<P><BR><I>How do I choose a CCRC?</I><P>"Because of the entrance fee, you should treat a CCRC as you would any investment," advises Walsh.  It's particularly important to investigate the financial stability and management experience of the facility.  Some communities have gone bankrupt, though CCRCs are more regulated than they once were.  Because many of them are run by nonprofit organizations, they do not have deep pockets to pay back residents if the CCRC should go belly up, says Walsh.  Have an attorney and financial advisor carefully review the contract.<P>Walsh recommends that people look into CCRCs well before they may need or want one--thewaiting lists for good facilities can be years long.<P><BR><HR><P><I>For more information, contact:</I><P>The American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, (202) 783- 2242, which publishes a directory of CCRCs and has accredited 175 CCRCs in 26 states.  Also, check with your local Better Business Bureau for the management's reputation at a particular CCRC. Another source of information is your state's office on aging concerning state regulations of CCRCs.<P><FONT SIZE=2>[August 1995,National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE)</A>, all rights reserved.

 WINDFALL MONEY: WHAT TO DO IF YOU RECEIVE 

</P>



<P>A LARGE SUM OF MONEY</P><BR>

</CENTER><P>Denver--What would you do if you won the lottery
or received an inheritance, or got a large sum from a pension
plan or an insurance settlement? While many fantasize about
such possibilities, few of us devote rational thought to
these happy predicaments. Yet every year, millions of
windfall dollars go to Americans--many of whom,
unfortunately, are unprepared to make effective financial
decisions.</P>
<P>The best windfall strategy begins even before you receive
the money. Your first step upon notification is to consult a
tax advisor about the tax consequences of your new wealth.
These vary, depending on the particular type of windfall you
receive. For example, lottery earnings are fully taxable;
receiving an inheritance is generally tax-free, but earnings
derived from the inheritance are subject to income tax.
Often, some of the taxes can be reduced by restructuring the
receipt of the money, regardless of the type of windfall.</P>
<P>The biggest mistakes usually are made after the money is
received. &quot;Most people jump in and spend or invest the
money,&quot; said Ron Meier, CPA, a senior academic at the
College for Financial Planning&reg;. &quot;This explains the
stories of lottery winners who claim bankruptcy a few years
after their award. The money and what it can buy are so
overwhelming that it's easy to overlook the best
solution--one that runs contrary to popular thought in a
society geared toward instant gratification and an
action-oriented approach.</P>
<P>&quot;This is one of those rare situations in which
you're best doing nothing--or almost nothing--for a
year,&quot; said Meier. &quot;It is important to think about
the process, the long-lasting aspects of what having this
money means.&quot;</P>
<P>Meier recommends putting the money in a secure place,
such as an interest-bearing checking account, money market
fund, or CD, for 12 months. With a large sum of windfall
money, even a low interest rate can produce a nice return.
For instance, 3 percent of $100,000 is $3,000. Then invest
that first year's income in your financial education or in
using a financial advisor.</P>
<P>&quot;It literally pays to take your time and invest in
yourself and your future decisions,&quot; said Meier.
&quot;In the meantime, educate yourself about money
management and investing. In a year, you can learn about
finances, psychologically adjust to having money, and
objectively assess your short- and long-term objectives, as
well as your tolerance for the level of risk involved in all
types of investing.&quot;</P>
<P>To build your knowledge and awareness about money
management and investment issues, community college adult
education courses present a good opportunity. Meier advises
taking at least two courses to learn about relevant issues
and, at the same time, to be exposed to more than one
investment philosophy and teacher.</P>
<P>In addition, supplement your classroom training with
other sources of knowledge, such as financial planning and
investment texts, magazines, or newsletters. Besides learning
about strategies and investments, you will be exposed to a
variety of financial outlooks. By joining a group such as the
American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) (for
information, call (312) 280-0170), you can discuss these
ideas and products, learn different viewpoints, and test your
own knowledge.</P>
<P>A second step to consider is finding a financial advisor.
You have educated yourself so that you can weigh their
counsel and make the most objective decisions about your
money. But finding the right professional is important.</P>
<P>&quot;Common practice is to talk to your friends for
recommendations about the practitioners they've used
successfully,&quot; said Meier. &quot;This is a problem
because, before you even get started, you are limiting
yourself to a single advisor before you even know how to
evaluate their talents. Instead, optimize your investment
potential. With your educational background, you can play an
active, informed role in choosing and working with an
advisor.&quot;</P>
<P>To do this, contact a number of organizations, including
the Institute of Certified Financial Planners (303-751-7600)
and National Association of Personal Financial Advisors
(800-366-2732). Check with federal and state agencies to see
if any complaints have been filed against the advisor.
Organizations also can include the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission for Registered Investment Advisors
(202-272-7440), the Certified Financial Planner Board of
Standard, Inc., for CFP&reg; licensees (303-830-7543), and
the National Association of Securities Dealers for securities
sales representatives (800-289-9999).</P>
<P>Meier recommends contacting five to ten financial
advisors by telephone, requesting their brochures, and
recording their responses to the following list of
questions.</P>
<UL compact><LI>What type of professional education do you
have and what are your technical qualifications to help me
with my finances?</LI>
<LI>Who is your average client and what is the typical
dollar amount you manage?</LI>
<LI>How do you charge: fee-only, commission, fee plus
commission, salary, or salary plus commission? How much does
it cost to retain your services?</LI>
<LI>Do you have any conflicts of interest: products you sell
or a company you represent that will gain from your
recommendations?</LI>
<LI>What process do you suggest new clients follow?</LI>
<LI>How long have you been in business and in this
area?</LI>
<LI>What results can I expect to see at the end of a year;
at the end of three years?</LI>
</UL>
<P>Based on their responses, select three advisors you would
most like to speak with face to face. Ask for a letter
detailing how they will work with you, and then discuss your
expectations, parameters, and the type of accountability you
want.&quot;Remember, you are entering a business
relationship, and proceed as you would with a partner,&quot;
said Meier. &quot;Finally, trust your business instincts and
prepare to make the most of your newfound wealth.&quot;The
National Endowment for Financial Education&reg; (NEFE&reg;)
advocates standards for all financial advisors and is
dedicated to the goal of helping Americans achieve financial
well-being. Divisions within the NEFE structure include the
College for Financial Planning, the Institute for Tax
Studies&reg;, the Institute for Wealth Management(SM), the
Institute for Retirement Planning(SM), the NEFE Public
Education Center, and NEFE Press(SM). The 24-year-old College
for Financial Planning, NEFE's degree-granting division, is
accredited by the Commission on Institutions of Higher
Education of the North Central Association of Colleges and
Schools (NCA). The College for Financial Planning Master of
Science degree program also is accredited by the Accrediting
Commission of the Distance Education and Training Council.In
addition, other curricula offered by the College for
Financial Planning include the Certified Financial
Planner&reg; Professional Education Program, Advanced Studies
courses, Foundations in Financial Planning, the Financial
Paraplanner Program&reg;, and a broad range of professional
development offerings.</P>

<HR><P><br><P><h2>PHILOSOPHY OF SERVICE</h2>
<p>Managing risk is a dynamic process. As your insurance broker, our commitment to your success and the success of your program is ongoing. This means playing an active role, informing and anticipating, rather than reacting, and coming to you with new ideas and suggestions on a regular basis - not just once a year. It means delivering what we promise and focusing on your needs rather than our own.
<p><BR>
<p><h2>EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE</H2>

<p>Established in 1917 by Charles E. Rue, Rue Insurance evolved from a small agency serving the local farmers and townspeople of Mercer County into a multi million dollar, full service firm that uses technology to complement the skills and personal insights of our people. Nationally we rank in size within the top 5% of all insurance brokers. Our clients cross the spectrum from families, to local entrepreneurs, to regional and national companies. Their insurance programs range in size from $200 to an excess of $2,000,000. In each case our staff of 43 works hard to be sure our clients insurance needs are properly met.
<p>
<p>
The experience of our people and extensive network of quality resources put us in an ideal position to deliver the expertise, products and services your program requires. 
<p>
<p>
<BR>
<h2>ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES</H2>
<P>
In addition to working with the traditional insurance marketplace, Rue Insurance has experience with alternative markets which generally offer more flexibility and creativity in the structure of an insurance program. The typical insurance company not only provides the "risk taking" part of insurance, but all of the ancillary services that go along with it such as claims handling, loss control and audit services.
<p>
<p>
By exploring alternative products and services, additional options may be available which will allow these ancillary services to be "unbundled". Instead of receiving an insurance company's standardized services, specialized claims and loss control services could be designed which specifically address your needs. This unique approach further enhances your ability to gain control and influence over its own insurance program.

The history of CHAS. E. RUE & SON, INC. , T/A RUE INSURANCE dates back to 1917 to a feed mill in rural Windsor,  N.J.  Here Charles E. Rue founded the business as an adjunct to his mill.

<p>
<p>He was joined by his son, C. Lester Rue, in 1917. The family tradition continued as the business grew.  Both of C. Lester Rue's sons joined the firm upon completion of their education, Charles in 1949 after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania and Bill in 1969 after his graduation from Rider College.

<p>
<p>In the early years, the business was operating from rental space on West State Street in Trenton. Continuous growth required a move to Mercerville in 1962, Hamilton Square in 1979, and in January, 1985 we occupied our new corporate headquarters at 3812 Quakerbridge Road in Mercerville. This location houses our Commercial Insurance Division, Personal Insurance Division and our Employee Benefits Division.
<p>
<p>
Through all the years, we have taken great pride in our devoted staff and the service they provide to our clients. We recognize that courteous professional service is the reason for the evolution that has taken place at Rue Insurance, an evolution that has turned a small family business into a multi-million dollar insurance organization. That pride continues today, stronger than ever, and we look forward to servicing your insurance needs today, and for years to come.

<hr>
<P><B>A Brief History</B>
<P>It was 1921, and the downtown St. Louis business district was the hub of local commercial activity.  During that era of civic progress, two St. Louis entrepreneurs, Carl P. Daniel and Jesse P. Henry, opened what ultimately would become the largest privately-owned, independent insurance brokerage firm in Missouri - The Daniel and Henry Company.
<P>The founders' vision was to operate a full-service insurance agency in a manner different from others of their peers.  They sought to share common facilities, overhead and expenses among a group of individual brokers.  The important distinction was that each broker owned and controlled his own book of business.  The result was successful: Daniel and Henry created a costeffective management style that continues to benefit both its customers and its brokers in <I>a</I> highly competitive industry.
<P>Daniel and Henry's history of profitability and expansion includes not only insuring the St. Louis business community, but in providing coverage for well-known local cultural and civic institutions.  The beginnings of this relationship can be traced to an act of civic-mindedness at the outset when Daniel and Henry led an initiative to restore the
<P>St. Louis childhood home of Eugene Field, the famous children's poet.  The company, joined by the St. Louis Board of Education, encouraged the city's school children to collect pennies to help fund the restoration.  This effort saved the historic home which now stands as St. Louis' onlv museum of 19th century childhood.
<P>While maintaining and building on its roots as a St. Louis insurance agency serving businesses in the greater metropolitan area, Daniel and Henry now provides a full range of risk management and insurance products to its clients nationally and internationally.

<P><B><I>WHY DO BUSINESS WITH US?</I></B></P>
<P><B><I>READ OUR MISSION, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY</B>.</I></P>
<P>GEM-YOUNG Insurance &amp; Financial Services is committed to providing sound and innovative ideas to our clients in Property/Casualty Insurance, and Financial Services.  We are a family owned, multiple lines insurance and financial services agency.</P>
<P>Our resources and our services are client centered.  We provide comprehensive strategies to balance the risk management and financial planning needs of our clients by offering a complete portfolio of insurance and financial services.  These are tailored to individuals, families and businesses.  We will always look to represent only financially sound and competitive insurance carriers.</P>
<P>We confirm our commitment by combining our personal approach to service with our technical expertise to serve the needs of our clients.</P>
<P><B><I>TAKE A MOMENT TO GET TO KNOW OUR HISTORY</I></B></P>
<P><I>GEM-YOUNG insurance &amp; Financial Services, Inc. , </I>is celebrating its 49th anniversary.  Founded in 1947 by Jim &amp; Mary Louise Gemma Dapdle, the Gem Insurance Agency provided liability and fire coverages to Jim Daprile's life insurance clients.</P>
<P>From very humble beginnings, Gem Insurance Agency, a family business, grew and in 1969, acquired Bob &amp; Marge Young's small Grange agency, another family owned business.</P>
<P>The merger of <I>GEM-YOUNG Insurance Agency, </I>set out to blend the two predominately personal lines books of business.  It set a path to become one of the leading agencies writing personal auto and homeowners insurance in Mahoning County.</P>
<P>From 1969 until 1993, 12 of the 13 Daprile children would have worked in the Agency in various capacities.  Jim Daprile remained active in the insurance industry until his death in April of 1994.</P>
<P>Today, in its second generation of family ownership, brothers and partners Leo and Terry Daprile head up an enthusiastic and dedicated team of eleven talented individuals.  Leo handles Agency Administration and heads up the Life and Financial Services Division, while Terry handles Agency Operations and Automation.  Property/Casualty production is managed by Sales Manager, Rich Novotny, and backed by <I>GEM-YOUNG'S </I>professional and friendly support staff.</P></BODY></HTML>

<H3>Summit Insurance Group - Insurance - Our Philosophy</h3>

<P> <B><I>INSURANCE... </I></B></P>
<P><B><I> </I></B><I>It's one of those business and personal protection </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>necessities that few people give much thought to </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>on a daily basis... and perhaps that's the </I>way it </P>
<P> <I>should be. After all, you have a busy life and a </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>business </I>to <I>run. </I></P><P><BR>
<P><I> </I><I>So why should you worry about things </I><I>like </I><I>which </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>insurance company to use, what type of policy fits </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>your needs, or comparing competitive premiums? </I></P><P><BR>
<P><I> </I><I>You shouldn't, because at Summit Insurance Group, </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>we do all that for you. We do business with dozens of </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>insurance companies providing commercial, personal, </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>life, and health insurance. For </I>you <I>that means the </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>best protection at the lowest cost, which should </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>mean peace of mind for you. That's the real reason </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>you invest in insurance anyway-to be able to </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>function in your business and personal life without </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>the threat of losing part or all of what you've </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>worked so hard to build. </I></P><P><BR>
<P><I> </I><I>Our professional insurance staff is prepared to </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>assist you with a </I>no <I>cost, no obligation review </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>of your insurance. We will work with you to </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>determine your business and personal insurance </I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>needs and then propose a plan that fits you. </I></P>

<TITLE>Gem-Young - Meet The Financial Services Team</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<img src="gemlogo.gif"><p>
<P><B>MEET THE FINANCIAL SERVICES TEAM</B>.....................</P>
<P><B>Reina Harvey, Account Executive </B>Reina has been with the agency since 1994.  Reina specializes in various aspects of the health insurance business.  Specifically, Individual and group health, Long Term Care insurance, Medicare Supplements and life insurance.  What sets Reina (pronounced Renee) apart is her strong product knowledge, strong work ethic, and her desire to only sell the client what they need.  &quot;The agency is owned by family and run like family.  This attitude carries over in how I care for my clients.  It makes all the difference in the world.&quot;</P>
<P><B>Jim Soda, Senior Account Executive </B>Jim has been a member of the team since 1993.  As a former owner of a large transportation company, Jim fully understands the struggle many executives face when making key benefits decisions.  &quot;I'm uniquely qualified to not only identify key benefit problems but also offer real solutions.&quot; Jim has also been involved in the development of one of the fastest growing deferred compensation programs today.  It's called &quot;The Private Pension Alternative, An Insurance Based Retirement Plan.&quot; A plan that allows for executives to enhance their retirement benefits on a selective basis.</P>
<P><B>Ruth Franklin, Administrative Assistant </B>Ruth has been with the agency since 1993.  Ruth brings with her almost a decade of experience from the banking industry.  Ruth is responsible for the administrative and service aspects of the financial services division.  Keeping track of complex client information is a skill that Ruth does very well.  What sets Ruth apart is her honesty, integrity, and her desire to handle the concerns of our clients.  &quot;Clients are family, just like all of us are family.&quot;</P>
<P><B>Doug Jones, District Manager, Cancer Insurance</B> <B>Division </B>Doug brings to this new division over two decades of management experience.  Doug specializes in the sales, and service of this supplemental health policy.  What attracted Doug to this product is the fact that according to the American Cancer Society, as of the 1993 facts and figures, Cancer will strike one out of three Americans in their lifetimes.  &quot;Cancer has become such a prevalent part of our lives today, and even though many health plans cover the direct costs of cancer, it is the indirect costs that are putting undue financial burdens on today's family.  I want to help keep people well financially as they become well from their cancer.&quot;</P></BODY></HTML>

<H3>Safe Harbour Group, Ltd. -We Get To Know You Before We Create An Insurance Program For You</H3>

<H4>Our Policies Are Personalized And Customized</H4>
<HR>
<p>

<img src="safehar3.gif"><p>



We believe that even business insurance is an individual matter.  We develop personalized insurance packages based upon your identified insurance needs.<P>

At SAFE HARBOUR, we take the time and invest the energy to build a relationship with you, based upon trust with integrity and service.  There are many kinds of insurance available, each offering particular advantages.  By creating an insurance program just for you, we combine the best features and benefits at the most cost efficient rates.<P>

But, this is just the beginning of our service.  Later on, we're here to help when you have a claim.  That's when our service is most often appreciated.  It's an important difference that our clients say makes SAFE HARBOUR GROUP  special.  And, it's a commitment that goes back over a hundred years.  Our history confirms a record of long term relationships.  We've been insuring many clients, in business and for personal coverages, for two and three generations.<P>

Your business buys insurance for nearly the same reasons that individuals do, but from a different approach.  You have property to protect from fire, theft and liability.  If you are a product manufacturer, there is product liability insurance.<P>

Professionals have malpractice insurance to consider.  If you have employees, you'll need workers compensation, maybe even protection against allegations of wrongful discharge!  If you offer benefits, there's life, health and disability insurance.  If you are self employed, your insurance coverage can nd between you and 'financial devastation.  Then, of course, there's the future to consider.  Are you going to offer pension plans, 401 K plans and special executive compensation investment programs?<P>

All these requirements need to be examined and evaluated.  Then, with costs and benefits firmly in mind, SAFE HARBOUR will customize an insurance portfolio or benefits program that will enable you to conduct your business or personal life without worry about these matters.  We'll monitor your programs as part of our service and keep you abreast of new developments in insurance and benefits.  Our job is to protect your interests today and tomorrow.  Additionally, if what you need is advice, we offer insurance consulting services.

<P> <B>LOSS CONTROL </B></P>
<P><B> </B>All carriers that we represent have Loss Engineering Departments. While all of our carriers do </P>
<P> a fine job some carriers have reputations that surpass other carriers. All in all everyone is </P>
<P> capable of providing superlative loss engineering services. </P>
<P> A partial list of topics we are able to address is: </P><BR>
<P><B> DRIVERS</B> - Since your driver is an integral part of your operation and is responsible for the </P>
<P> majority of the claims, this is the area in which most time should be spent. Areas of interest </P>
<P> would include: </P>
<P><I><U> Driver Selection</U></I> - driver qualifications, etc. </P>
<P><I><U> Driver Training</U></I> - safety meetings, etc. </P>
<P><I><U> Driver Supervision</U></I> - road observations, etc. </P>
<P><I><U> Driver Recognition</U></I> - good driver awards, etc. </P>
<P><I><U> Driver Discipline</U></I> - oral, written, suspend etc. </P><BR>
<P><B> ACCIDENT ANALYSIS</B> - A review of accidents using different variables such as Type of </P>
<P> Claim, Day of Week, Driver, help point out specific areas that need attention. </P><BR>
<P><B> LOSS DOLLAR ANALYSIS</B> - A breakdown of losses into dollar amounts, helps us determine </P>
<P> number of claim dollars at various loss levels. This helps in establishing what level of retention </P>
<P> can be handled. </P><BR>
<P><B> VEHICLE MAINTENANCE</B> - While very few claims are a result of mechanical failure, </P>
<P> vehicles still need to be in good operating condition. Daily logs and P.M. records need be kept </P>
<P> in place, to aid in vehicle maintenance verification as well as claims defense. </P><BR>
<P><B> SAFETY MATERIAL</B> - Access is maintained to various other means of loss prevention material </P>
<P> such as National Safety Council tapes, VCR tapes specifically prepared for your </P>
<P> Industry, printed literature, etc </P>

<P> <B>CUSTOMER SERVICE </B></P>
<P><B> </B>We have always believed that more than one person should be aware of all facets of each client's </P>
<P> account. Our feeling on this issue <B>is </B>that when a client calls us, he or she has a question to be </P>
<P> answered or a need to be filled. <B>(It's </B>not too often that a client calls us to just chitchat.) This </P>
<P> approach allows us to answer that question or fill that need immediately. </P><BR>
<P> The faster we take care of our clients ... the happier they are. </P>
<P> With this in mind, there would be a team assigned to service your needs and requirements. The </P>
<P> team would consists of: </P><BR>
<P> Account Executive </P>
<P> Account Manager </P>
<P> Bookkeeping / Accounting Personnel </P>
<P> Claims Servicing Representative </P><BR>
<B><I></I><P> Our normal business hours are Monday to Friday from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. We do however, </P>
<P> have personnel in the office as early as 8:00 AM and as late as 6:00 PM, on a regular basis. </P>
<P> Weekend and evening hours vary to accommodate you.... Our Fax line is operational 24 Hours </P>
<P> a day. </P><BR></B>
<P> In case of an emergency, David Borg is available at all hours of the day. </P>
<P> We also include talks on your future plans, goals, and direction. We discuss the general </P>
<P> atmosphere of competition in not only your industry, but also in the insurance industry. Topics </P>
<P> such as markets, coverage availability, and pricing - are just a few items discussed. In doing so, </P>
<P> we feel we will be better able to serve your future needs. </P><BR>
<P> Our discussions would also focus on any adverse loss history you may have encountered and </P>
<P> what steps would be available to get back on track. Depending on the outcome of information </P>
<P> developed above, specific goals are then established. They will include means of obtaining them, </P>
<P> means for measuring their obtainability, verification of non conflicting issues and of course, a </P>
<P> time frame for compliance. </P><BR>
<P> Further modifications and adjustments are made accordingly. </P>
<P> All in all, the idea here is to become an integral part of our client's operation </P><BR>
<B><P> ... 'NOT JUST ANOTHER VENDOR'. </P></B>

<H2>Heritage Insurance Services - How IT Professionals keep their customers happy when things go wrong...</H2>

<P>

You can now enjoy the security of a new type of Professional Indemnity Insurance offering much better cover designed specifically for the computer industry.<P>

In the past if you supplied a system, service or design that underperformed you could not claim on your policy until your client became so angry that they put forward a legal claim against you.<P>

With our unique new policy you can now claim compensation even if your customer has not made a claim against you. You just ell us what has happened and provide evidence that your client has a likely valid legal claim against you.<P>

We will settle the claim on the basis of what your legal liability might be if the case went to court. Either we will send your customer a cheque in compensation or send you a cheque in lieu of any payment your customer is withholding from you.<P>

How much does this all cost? Surprisingly no more than a standard professional indemnity policy which does not have this unique feature. By tackling a potential problem early we can keep your client happy without incurring heavy legal costs and in turn keep down the cost of your professional indemnity insurance.<P>

To get an indication of how much this valuable protection will cost you complete the following questionnaire and mail or e-mail to Heritage Insurance Services.<P>
