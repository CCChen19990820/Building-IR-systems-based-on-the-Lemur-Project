<blockquote>

	<font size=5>A</font>S soon as a letter to the editor arrives at our offices,
it is labeled with a gummed yellow rectangle that bears the words &quot;The Mail.&quot;
During the past few months we have put such rectangles on more than 300 letters
pertaining to George McKenna's cover story 
<A HREF="../../95sep/abortion/abortion.htm">&quot;On Abortion: A Lincolnian Position&quot;</A>
(September, 1995). Letters about that article were published in last month's
issue, and more appear in this month's--and the letters continue to arrive. We
have received more mail about this article than about any other in years--more
even than about Barbara Dafoe Whitehead's &quot;Dan Quayle Was Right&quot; (April,
1993).<p>

How to characterize the response to McKenna?  The best way to assess it, of 
course, is simply to read the <A HREF="../../95dec/letters.htm">letters 
column.</A> Whether agreeing fiercely or disagreeing fiercely with 
McKenna's position--which argued for a tough national anti-abortion 
strategy that nonetheless leaves intact a woman's legal right to have an 
abortion--the letter writers by and large offer arguments that reflect 
careful thought and in many cases passionate commitment.  Anger and protest 
have typically been channeled into vigorous prose.  We have read with 
interest all the letters we received on the McKenna article.  We wish we 
could publish more of them.<p>

And then there were the letters that said, essentially, &quot;Cancel my
subscription.&quot; We receive a few of these every month, objecting to one article
or another, and they always prompt a sigh. The sigh is not because of the loss
of income, though we regret losing a subscriber. It is rather because such
letters reflect a misunderstanding of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>'s very
purpose.<p>

Ours is not an ideological magazine, 
like <A HREF="http://www.nationalreview.com/nationalreview/mission.html">
<i >National Review </i></A>
or <i>The Nation</i>--the sort of magazine that might justifiably be punished for
&quot;heresy&quot; by an act of defection. We are an invitational forum, not the pulpit
of an established church. Only on rare occasions has this magazine published
unsigned editorials meant to put forward an institutional point of view--for to
do so with any regularity would imply that everything else in the magazine was
selected to advance some broader, though perhaps hidden, agenda. Indeed, one
essential point of this enterprise from the outset has been to provide a place
where diverse perspectives on matters of national importance--perspectives
grounded in logic and facts as opposed to emotional rhetoric, and expressed
reasonably and tastefully--can get a full public hearing. The founding editors
wrote in the first issue of the magazine that <i>The Atlantic </i>would be the
organ &quot;of no party or clique.&quot; We are strict constructionists with regard to
this clause of our constitution.<p>

For the record, we do of course cancel subscriptions when so requested. We also
welcome anyone back.   --THE EDITORS

Today our nation's most prestigious civic groups, from the League of Women

Voters to the American Civil Liberties Union, are committed to its protection

and subsidization. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education now

requires that abortion techniques be taught in all obstetrics-and-gynecology

residency training programs. Influential voices in politics and the media are

now demanding the assignment of U.S. marshals to protect abortion clinics

against violence, and a federal law passed last year prescribes harsh criminal

penalties for even nonviolent acts of civil disobedience if they are committed

by demonstrators at abortion clinics. Some private organizations that

administer birth-control programs and provide abortions, notably 



									<!--LINK-->

<A href=http://www.ppca.org/>Planned

Parenthood</A>,



 are closely tied to government bureaucracies: Planned

Parenthood receives one third of its income from the federal government. Abortion today is

as American as free speech, freedom of religion, or any other practice

protected by our courts.<p>





<A HREF="./abortind.htm"><img src="../../../images/shorsera.gif" align=left

vspace=10 hspace=10 border=0>

</A>



With this difference: unlike other American rights, abortion cannot be

discussed in plain English. Its warmest supporters do not like to call it by

its name.<p>



Abortion is a "reproductive health procedure" or a "termination of pregnancy."

Abortion clinics are "reproductive health clinics" (more recently, "women's

clinics"), and the right to obtain an abortion is "reproductive freedom."

Sometimes the word "abortion" is unavoidable, as in media accounts of the

abortion controversy, but then it is almost invariably preceded by a line of

nicer-sounding words: "the right of a women to choose" abortion. This is still

not enough to satisfy some in the abortion movement. In an op-ed piece that

appeared in the <i>The New York Times </i>shortly after a gunman killed some

employees and wounded others at two Brookline, Massachusetts, abortion clinics,

a counselor at one of the clinics complained that the media kept referring to

her workplace as an abortion clinic. "I hate that term," she declared. At the

end of the piece she suggested that her abortion clinic ought to be called "a

place of healing and care." <p>



The Clinton Administration, the first Administration clearly committed to

abortion, seems to be trying hard to promote it without mentioning it.

President Bill Clinton's 





									<!--LINK-->

<A href="gopher://calypso-2.oit.unc.edu:70/11/sunsite.d/politics.d/health.d">1993 health-care bill </A>



would have nationalized the

funding of abortion, forcing everyone to buy a "standard package" that included

it. Yet nowhere in the bill's 1,342 pages was the word "abortion" ever used. In

various interviews both Clintons acknowledged that it was their intention to

include abortion under the category of "services for pregnant women." Another

initiative in which the Clinton Administration participated, the 





									<!--LINK-->

<A HREF="http://www.iisd.ca/linkages/Cairo/program/p00000.html">draft

report</A>



for last year's United Nations International Conference on Population and

Development, used similar language. Abortion, called "pregnancy termination,"

was subsumed under the general category of "reproductive health care," a term

used frequently in the report. <p>



Why, in a decade when public discourse about sex has become determinedly

forthright, is "abortion" so hard to say? No one hesitates to say "abortion" in

other contexts--in referring, for example, to aborting a plane's takeoff. Why

not say "abortion of a fetus"? Why substitute a spongy expression like

"termination of pregnancy"? And why do abortion clinics get called

"reproductive health clinics" when their manifest purpose is to <i>stop

</i>reproduction? Why all this strange language? What is going on here?<p>



The answer, it seems to me, is unavoidable. Even defenders and promoters of

abortion sense that there is something not quite right about the procedure. "I

abhor abortions," Henry Foster, President Clinton's unconfirmed nominee for

Surgeon General, has said. Clinton himself, who made no secret of his support

for abortion during his 1992 campaign, still repeats the mantra of "safe,

legal, and rare" abortion. Why "rare"? If abortion is a constitutional right,

on a par with freedom of speech and freedom of religion, why does it have to be

"rare"? The reason Clinton uses this language should be obvious. He knows he is

talking to a national electorate that is deeply troubled about abortion.

Shortly before last year's congressional elections his wife went even further

in appealing to this audience by characterizing abortion as "wrong" (though she

added, "I don't think it should be criminalized"). <p>



Sometimes even abortion lobbyists show a degree of uneasiness about what it is

they are lobbying for. At the end of 1993 Kate Michelman, the head of the

<a href="http://www.naral.org"> National Abortion and Reproductive Rights 

Action League</a>, was interviewed by the

<i>Philadelphia Inquirer </i>about NARAL's new emphasis on the prevention of

teen pregnancies. The reporter quoted Michelman as saying, "We think abortion

is a bad thing." Michelman complained that she had been misquoted, whereupon

she was reminded that the interview had been taped. Nevertheless, NARAL issued

a statement a few days later declaring that Michelman "has never said--and

would never say--that `abortion is a bad thing.'" Michelman, who had reason to

know better, sought only to "clarify" her remark in a letter to the

<i>Inquirer</i>. "It is not abortion itself that is a bad thing," she wrote.

"Rather, our nation's high rate of abortion represents a failure" of our system

of sex education, contraception, and health care. But a month later Michelman

herself, testifying before a House subcommittee on energy and commerce,

insisted that "the reporter absolutely quoted me incorrectly," and she later

told a <i>Washington Post </i>reporter, "I would never, never, never, never,

never mean to say such a thing." Not until the <i>Post </i>reporter showed her

the transcript did Michelman finally acknowledge--somewhat evasively --that she

had said it: "I'm obviously guilty of saying something that led her to put that

comment in there." <p>



Whatever else Michelman's bobbing and weaving reveals, it shows how nervous

abortion advocates can get when the discussion approaches the question of what

abortion <i>is</i>. Even if we accept Michelman's amended version of her

remark, which is that it is not abortion but the "high rate" of abortion that

is a bad thing, the meaning is hardly changed. If one abortion is not a bad

thing, why are many abortions bad? What is it about abortion that is so

troubling? <p>



The obvious answer is that abortion is troubling because it is a killing

process. Abortion clinics may indeed be places of "healing and care," as the

Planned Parenthood counselor maintains, but their primary purpose is to kill

human fetuses. Whether those fetuses are truly "persons" will continue to be

debated by modern scholastics, but people keep blurting out fragments of what

was long a moral consensus in this country. Once in a while even a newscaster,

carefully schooled in <i>Sprachregelungen</i>, will slip up by reporting the

murder of "a woman and her unborn baby," thus implying that something more than

a single homicide has taken place. But that "something" must not be probed or

examined; the newscaster must not speak its name. Abortion has thus come to

occupy an absurd, surrealistic place in the national dialogue: It cannot be

ignored and it cannot be openly stated. It is the corpse at the dinner party.<p>

<b>DOUGLAS AND 



THE DEMOCRATS</b><p>



ONLY one other institution in this country has been treated so evasively, and

that is the institution that was nurtured and protected by the government

during the first eighty-seven years of our nation's existence: the institution

of slavery.<p>



The men who drafted the 





									<!--LINK-->

<A HREF =

http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html

>Constitution</A>



 included representatives from slave states who were

determined to protect their states' interests. Yet they were all highly vocal proponents of human liberty. How does one reconcile liberty with

slavery? They did it by producing a document that referred to slavery in three

different places without once mentioning it. Slaves were "persons"--or,

sometimes, "other persons"--in contrast to "free persons." The slave trade

(which the Constitution prohibited Congress from banning until 1808) was

referred to as "the Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the

States now existing shall think proper to admit." Free states were required to

return fugitive slaves to their masters in the slave states, but in that clause

a slave was a "person held to Service or Labour" and a master was "the party to

whom such Service or Labour may be due." <p>



At least the founders recognized the humanity of slaves by calling them

"persons"; but in the next generation the status of slaves, and of blacks in

general, steadily declined. By the end of the 1820s slaves were reduced to a

species of property to be bought and sold like other property. Thomas

Jefferson, who in 1776 had tried to insert into the Declaration of Independence

a denunciation of the King for keeping open "a market where MEN should be

bought &amp; sold," now agonized only in private. Publicly all he could say on

the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration (the last year of his life) was

that the progress of enlightenment had vindicated the "palpable truth, that the

mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored

few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God,"

adding vaguely, "these are grounds of hope for others." <p>



Jefferson often shied away from public controversy, but even the most

flamboyant political leaders of the early nineteenth century could become

suddenly circumspect when the talk turned to slavery. Andrew Jackson left

office in 1837 blaming the South's secession threats on those northerners who

insisted on talking about "the most delicate and exciting topics, topics upon

which it is impossible that a large portion of the Union can ever speak without

strong emotion." Such talk, he said, assaulted "the feelings and rights" of

southerners and "their institutions." Jackson, usually a plainspoken man, would

not mar the occasion of his last presidential address by saying the words

"abolitionist" and "slavery." When slavery was discussed during the antebellum

period, it was usually in the language of "rights"--the property rights of

slaveholders and the sovereign rights of states. In 1850 the famous Whig

senator Daniel Webster defended his support for a tough fugitive-slave law on

such grounds. What right, he asked, did his fellow northerners have "to

endeavor to get round this Constitution, or to embarrass the free exercise of

the rights secured by the Constitution to the persons whose slaves escape from

them? None at all, none at all." <p>



Webster supported the Compromise of 1850, which attempted to settle the

question of slavery in the territories acquired from Mexico by admitting

California as a free state and Utah and New Mexico "with or without slavery as

their constitution may provide at the time of their admission." This last

principle was seized upon by Stephen A. Douglas, the "little giant" of the

Democratic Party, and made the basis of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which Douglas

pushed through Congress in 1854. Nullifying the Missouri Compromise of 1820, it

opened the remaining territories to slavery if the people in them voted for it.

Douglas's rationale was "popular sovereignty," a logical extension of states'

rights. The premise of states' rights was that any institution a state wanted

to have, it should have, so long as that didn't conflict with the Constitution.

Since slavery not only did not conflict with the Constitution but was protected

by it, Douglas said, it followed that each state had "a right to do as it

pleases on the subject of slavery," and the same principle should apply to the

territories. Douglas's appeal was not to the fiery pro-slavery minorities in

the South, who insisted that slavery was morally right, but to the vast

majority in the North, who simply felt uncomfortable talking about the subject.

He assured them that they didn't have to--that they could avoid the subject

altogether by leaving it to the democratic process. Let the people decide: if

they "want slavery, they shall have it; if they prohibit slavery, it shall be

prohibited." But what about the rights of slaves? That, Douglas said, was one

of those issues that should be left to moralists and theologians. It did not

belong in the political or legal realm. In speaking of the right to own slaves,

he said,<p>



I am now speaking of rights under the Constitution, and not of moral or

religious rights. I do not discuss the morals of the people of Missouri, but

let them settle that matter for themselves. I hold that the people of the

slaveholding States are civilized men as well as ourselves, that they bear

consciences as well as we, and that they are accountable to God and their

posterity and not to us. It is for them to decide therefore the moral and

religious right of the slavery question for themselves within their own limits.

<p>



Looking back today on Douglas's words, now 137 years old, one is struck by how

sophisticated and "modern" they seem. He ruled out of order any debate on the

morality of slavery. That was a "religious" question. It had no place in a

constitutional debate, and we had no right to judge other people in such terms.

In one of his debates with Lincoln in 1858, Douglas scolded his opponent for

telling the people in the slave states that their institution violated the law

of God. "Better for him," he said, to cheers and applause, "to adopt the

doctrine of `judge not lest ye be judged.'" <p>



The same notions and even some of the same language have found their way into

the abortion debate. In <i>Roe </i>v. <i>Wade</i>,<i> </i>in 1973, Justice

Harry Blackmun observed that philosophers and theologians have been arguing

about abortion for centuries without reaching any firm conclusions about its

morality. All "seemingly absolute convictions" about it are primarily the

products of subjective factors such as one's philosophy, religious training,

and "attitudes toward life and family and their values." As justices, he said,

he and his colleagues were required to put aside all such subjective

considerations and "resolve the issue by constitutional measurement free of

emotion and of predilection." As the abortion debate intensified, particularly

after Catholic bishops and Christian evangelicals entered the fray in the

1970s, the word "religious" was increasingly used by abortion defenders to

characterize their opponents. They used it in exactly the same sense that

Douglas used it in the slavery debate, as a synonym for "subjective,"

"personal," and thus, finally, "arbitrary." In this view, religion is largely a

matter of taste, and to impose one's taste upon another is not only repressive

but also irrational. This seems to be the view of the philosopher Ronald

Dworkin in his book <i>Life's Dominion </i>(1993) and in some of his subsequent

writings. What the opposition to abortion boils down to, Dworkin says, is an

attempt "to impose a controversial view on an essentially religious issue on

people who reject it." <p>



The approach has served as useful cover for Democratic politicians seeking to

reconcile their religious convictions with their party's platform and ideology.

The most highly publicized use of the "religious" model was the famous speech

given by Mario Cuomo, then the governor of New York, at the University of Notre

Dame during the 1984 presidential campaign. Characterizing himself as an

"old-fashioned" Catholic, Cuomo said that he accepted his Church's position on

abortion, just as he accepted its position on birth control and divorce. But,

he asked rhetorically, "must I insist you do?" By linking abortion with divorce

and birth control, Cuomo put it in the category of Church doctrines that are

meant to apply only to Catholics. Everyone agrees that it would be highly

presumptuous for a Catholic politician to seek to prevent non-Catholics from

practicing birth control or getting a divorce. But the pro-life argument has

always been that abortion is different from birth control and divorce, because

it involves a nonconsenting party--the unborn child. At one point in his speech

Cuomo seemed to acknowledge that distinction. "As Catholics," he said, "my wife

and I were enjoined never to use abortion to destroy the life we created, and

we never have," and he added that "a fetus is different from an appendix or a

set of tonsils." But then, as if suddenly recognizing where this line of

reasoning might lead, he said, "But not everyone in our society agrees with me

and Matilda." In other words, it was just a thought--don't bother with it if

you don't agree. <i>De gustibus non est disputandum.</i><p>



Cuomo's speech received considerable press coverage, because it was perceived

as a kind of thumb in the eye of New York's Cardinal John O'Connor, who had

been stressing the Church's unequivocal moral condemnation of abortion. The

argument, then, was newsworthy but not at all original. New York Senator Daniel

Patrick Moynihan, another pro-choice Catholic, had been saying much the same

thing since the mid-1970s, and by the 1980s it had become the standard

argument. One hears today from the Clintons, from spokespeople for the

American Civil Liberties Union</A>,



 and from the philosopher Ronald Dworkin,

the journalist Roger Rosenblatt, and the celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz, and from legions of

others that opposition to abortion is essentially religious, or private, and as

such has no place in the political realm. There is a patient philosophical

response to this argument, which others have spelled out at some length, but it

finds no purchase in a mass media that thrives on sound bites. There is also a

primal scream--"Murder!"--that is always welcomed by the media as evidence of

pro-life fanaticism. But is there a proper <i>rhetorical </i>response, a

response suited to civil dialogue that combines reason with anger and urgency?

I believe there is, and the model for it is Abraham Lincoln's response to

Stephen Douglas.<p>

<b>LINCOLN AND 



THE REPUBLICANS</b><p>



LINCOLN had virtually retired from politics by 1854, having failed to obtain a

much-coveted position in the Administration of Zachary Taylor. Then came the

passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Stephen Douglas's masterwork, which

permitted the extension of slavery into the territories. Lincoln was horrified.

In his view, slavery was like a cancer--or a "wen," as he called it. It could

be eliminated only if it was first contained. If it ever metastasized,

spreading into the new territories, it could never be stopped. He viewed the

Kansas-Nebraska Act as a stimulant to the growth of the cancer because it

invited slave-owning "squatters" to settle in the new territories, create

electoral majorities, and establish new slave states. One of the longest and

most passionate of Lincoln's speeches was his 1854 address on the act, which

rehearsed many of the themes that would reappear in his debates with Douglas.<p>



Douglas had boasted that the Kansas-Nebraska Act furthered democracy by leaving

the question of whether or not to adopt slavery up to the people in the

territories. Lincoln quickly homed in on the critical weakness in this

"self-government" argument: "When the white man governs himself, that is

self-government; but when he governs himself and also governs <i>another

</i>man, that is <i>more </i>than self-government--that is despotism." It would

not be despotism, of course, if slaves were not human: "That is to say,

inasmuch as you do not object to my taking my hog to Nebraska, therefore I must

not object to you taking your slave." This, Lincoln said, "is perfectly

logical, if there is no difference between hogs and negroes." Lincoln kept

returning to the question of the humanity of slaves, the question that Douglas

ruled out of bounds as essentially "religious." Everywhere, Lincoln said, even

in the South, people knew that slaves were human beings. If southerners really

believed that slaves were not human, why did they join in banning the

international slave trade, making it a capital offense? And if dealing in human

flesh was no different from dealing in hogs or cattle, why was the slave-dealer

regarded with revulsion throughout the South?<p>



You despise him utterly. You do not recognize him as a friend, or even as an

honest man. Your children must not play with his; they may rollick freely with

the little negroes, but not with the "slave-dealers" children. If you are

obliged to deal with him, you try to get through the job without so much as

touching him. <p>



People's moral intuitions could not be repressed; they would surface in all

kinds of unexpected ways: in winces and unguarded expressions, in labored

euphemisms, in slips of the tongue. Lincoln was on the lookout for these, and

he forced his opponents to acknowledge their significance: "Repeal the Missouri

Compromise--repeal all compromises--repeal the declaration of

independence--repeal all past history, you still can not repeal human nature.

It will still be the abundance of man's heart, that slavery extension is wrong;

and out of the abundance of his heart, his mouth will continue to speak." <p>



Douglas tried to evade the force of these observations by insisting that he

didn't care <i>what </i>was chosen; all he cared about was the freedom to

choose. At one point Douglas even tried to put his own theological spin on

this, suggesting that God placed good and evil before man in the Garden of Eden

in order to give him the right to choose. Lincoln indignantly rejected this

interpretation. "God did not place good and evil before man, telling him to

make his choice. On the contrary, he did tell him there was one tree, of the

fruit of which, he should not eat, upon pain of certain death. I should

scarcely wish so strong a prohibition against slavery in Nebraska." <p>



Lincoln's depiction of slavery as a moral cancer became the central theme of

his speeches during the rest of the 1850s. It was the warning he meant to

convey in his "House Divided" speech, in his seven debates with Douglas in

1858, and in the series of speeches that culminated in the 1860 presidential

campaign. In all these he continually reminded his audience that the theme of

choice without reference to the <i>object </i>of choice was morally empty. He

would readily agree that each state ought to choose the kind of laws it wanted

when it came to the protection and regulation of its commerce. Indiana might

need cranberry laws; Virginia might need oyster laws. But "I ask if there is

any parallel between these things and this institution of slavery." Oysters and

cranberries were matters of moral indifference; slavery was not.<p>



The real issue in this controversy--the one pressing upon every mind--is the

sentiment on the part of one class that looks upon the institution of slavery

<i>as a wrong</i>,<i> </i>and of another class that <i>does not </i>look upon

it as a wrong. The sentiment that contemplates the institution of slavery in

this country as a wrong is the sentiment of the Republican party. <p>



Lincoln has been portrayed as a moral compromiser, even an opportunist, and in

some respects he was. Though he hoped that slavery would eventually be

abolished within its existing borders, he had no intention of abolishing it.

Although he said, in his "House Divided"speech of 1858, that "this government

cannot endure, permanently half <i>slave</i> and half <i>free</i>," Lincoln

made it clear in that speech, and in subsequent speeches and writings, that his

intention was not to abolish slavery but to "arrest the further spread of it,

and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in

course of ultimate extinction. . . ." In his first inaugural address, desperate

to keep the South in the Union, he even hinted that he might support a

constitutional amendment to protect slavery in the existing slave states

against abolition by the federal government--a kind of reverse Thirteenth

Amendment. The following year he countermanded an order by one of his own

generals that would have emancipated slaves in South Carolina, Georgia, and

Florida. In that same year he wrote the much-quoted letter to Horace Greeley

stating that his "paramount object" was not to free slaves but to save the

Union, and that if he could save the Union without freeing a single slave, he

would do it. But when it came down to the commitment he had made in the 1850s,

Lincoln was as stern as a New England minister. Slavery, he insisted, was an

evil that must not be allowed to expand--and he would not allow it to expand.

He struggled with a variety of strategies for realizing that principle, from

gradual, compensated emancipation to outright abolition, but he never for a

moment swerved from the principle. A month after his election Lincoln replied

in this way to a correspondent who urged him to temper his opposition to

slavery in the territories: "On the territorial question, I am inflexible. . .

. You think slavery is right and ought to be extended; we think it is wrong and

ought to be restricted."<p>

<b>A LINCOLNIAN POSITION 



ON ABORTION</b><p>



I SUGGESTED that we can find in Lincoln's anti-slavery rhetoric a coherent

position that could serve as a model for pro-life politicians today. How would

this rhetoric sound? Perhaps the best way to answer this is to provide a sample

of what might be said by a politician devoted to a cause but no less devoted to

building broad support for it. With the reader's indulgence, then, I will play

that politician, making the following campaign statement:<p>



"According to the Supreme Court, the right to choose abortion is legally

protected. That does not change the fact that abortion is morally wrong. It

violates the very first of the inalienable rights guaranteed in the Declaration

of Independence--the right to life. Even many who would protect and extend the

right to choose abortion admit that abortion is wrong, and that killing 1.5

million unborn children a year is, in the understated words of one, `a bad

thing.' Yet, illogically, they denounce all attempts to restrain it or even to

speak out against it. In this campaign I <i>will </i>speak out against it. I

will say what is in all our hearts: that abortion is an evil that needs to be

restricted and discouraged. If elected, I will not try to abolish an

institution that the Supreme Court has ruled to be constitutionally protected,

but I will do everything in my power to arrest its further spread and place it

where the public can rest in the belief that it is becoming increasingly rare.

I take very seriously the imperative, often expressed by abortion supporters,

that abortion <i>should </i>be rare. Therefore, if I am elected, I will seek to

end all public subsidies for abortion, for abortion advocacy, and for

experiments on aborted children. I will support all reasonable abortion

restrictions that pass muster with the Supreme Court, and I will encourage

those who provide alternatives to abortion. Above all, I mean to <i>treat it as

a wrong</i>. I will use the forum provided by my office to speak out against

abortion and related practices, such as euthanasia, that violate or undermine

the most fundamental of the rights enshrined in this nation's founding

charter." <p>



The position on abortion I have sketched--permit, restrict, discourage--is

unequivocally pro-life even as it is effectively pro-choice. It does not say "I

am personally opposed to abortion"; it says abortion is evil. Yet in its own

way it is pro-choice. First, it does not demand an immediate end to abortion.

To extend Lincoln's oncological trope: it concludes that all those who oppose

abortion can do right now is to contain the cancer, keep it from metastasizing.

It thus acknowledges the present legal status of "choice" even as it urges

Americans to choose life. Second, by supporting the quest for alternatives to

abortion, it widens the range of choices available to women in crisis

pregnancies. Studies of women who have had abortions show that many did not

really make an informed "choice" but were confused and ill-



informed

at the time, and regretful later. If even some of those reports are true, they

make a case for re-examining the range of choices actually available to

women.<p>



Would a candidate adopting this position be obliged to support only pro-life

nominees to the Supreme Court?To answer this, let's consider Lincoln's reaction

to <i>Dred Scott</i> v. <i>Sanford</i>, the 1857 Supreme Court ruling that

Congress had no right to outlaw slavery in the territories. Lincoln condemned

the decision but did not promise to reverse it by putting differently minded

justices on the Court. Instead his approach was to accept the ruling as it

affected the immediate parties to the suit but to deny its authority as a

binding precedent for policymaking by the other branches of the federal

government. If he were in Congress, he said in a speech delivered in July of

1858, shortly before his debates with Douglas, he would support legislation

outlawing slavery in the territories--despite the <i>Dred Scott</i> decision.

In our analogy we need not follow Lincoln that far to see the valid core of his

position. Yes, he was saying, the Supreme Court has the job of deciding cases

arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. But if its

decisions are to serve as durable precedents, they must be free of obvious

bias, based on accurate information, and consistent with "legal public

expectation"and established practice, or at least with long-standing precedent.

Since <i>Dred Scott</i> failed all these tests, Lincoln believed that it should

be reversed, and he intended to do what he could to get it reversed. But he

would not try to fill the Court with new, "catechized" justices (a process to

which he thought Douglas had been party regarding the Illinois state bench).

Instead he would seek to persuade the Court of its error, hoping that it would

reverse itself. Lest this seem naive, we must remember that <i>he intended to

conduct his argument before the American people</i>. Lincoln knew that in the

final analysis durable judicial rulings on major issues must be rooted in the

soil of American opinion. "Public sentiment," he said, "is every thing" in this

country.<p>



<i>With</i> it, nothing can fail; <i>against</i> it, nothing can succeed.

Whoever moulds public sentiment, goes deeper than he who enacts statutes, or

pronounces judicial decisions. He makes possible the inforcement of these, else

impossible.<p>



The lesson for pro-life leaders today is that instead of trying to fill the

Supreme Court with "catechized" justices, a strategy almost certain to

backfire, they should content themselves with modest, competent justices who

are free of ideological bias, and all the while keep their eyes on the real

prize:"public sentiment." <i>Dred Scott</i> was overturned within a decade by

the Civil War, but <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson</i>--the 1896 ruling validating

state-imposed racial segregation--darkened the nation for fifty-eight years

before it was overturned in <i>Brown </i>v. <i>Board of Education</i>. Yet

during that long night civil-rights advocates were not silent. In thousands of

forums, from university classrooms and law-school journals to churches and

political conventions, they argued their case against American-style apartheid.

In the end they not only won their legal case but also forged a new moral

consensus.<p>



It took time--time and patience. The lesson for pro-life advocates is that they

need to take the time to lay out their case. They may hope for an immediate end

to abortion, and they certainly have a First Amendment right to ask for it, but

their emphasis, Ibelieve, should be on making it clear to others why they have

reached the conclusions that they have reached. They need to reason with

skeptics and listen more carefully to critics. They need to demand less and

explain more. Whatever the outcome, that would surely contribute to the process

of reasonable public discourse. <p>



The "campaign statement" Ipresented above is my own modest contribution to that

process. It seeks common ground for a civil debate on abortion. It does not aim

at a quick fix; it is based on the Lincolnian premise that nothing is possible

without consensus. At the same time, it suggests that some measures can be

taken here and now, and with broad public support, to contain the spread of

abortion. <p>



Would either party, today, endorse such an approach? Probably not.<p>



It is easy to see why Democrats would run from it. Since 1972 pro-choice

feminists have become increasingly important players in Democratic Party

councils. In 1976 abortion lobbies got the Democratic platform committee to

insert a plank in the party platform opposing a constitutional amendment

banning abortion, and since then they have escalated their demands to include

public funding of abortion and special federal protection of abortion clinics.

No Democrat with serious national ambitions would ever risk offending them. A

long list of Democrats who were once pro-life--Edward Kennedy, Jesse Jackson,

even Al Gore and Bill Clinton--turned around in the seventies and eighties as

the lobbies tightened their grip on the party. In 1992 Robert Casey, the

pro-life governor of Pennsylvania, a liberal on every issue except abortion,

was not even permitted to speak at the Democratic National Convention.<p>



What is more puzzling--at first glance, anyway--is the tepid reception the

pro-life position has received over the years from centrist Republican leaders.

In the present, heated atmosphere of Republican presidential politics, most

Republican candidates have been wooing pro-life voters, obviously anticipating

their clout in next spring's primaries. But in the day-to-day management of

party affairs few Republican leaders have shown much enthusiasm for the cause.

Among the ten items in Newt Gingrich's 





									<!--LINK-->

<A href="http://edf.www.media.mit.edu/contract.html">Contract With America</A>



 there is no

reference to abortion (in fact, there is no reference to any of the

social-cultural issues that the Republicans once showcased, beyond demands for

tougher child-pornography laws and "strengthening rights of parents"). The

Republican national chairman, Haley Barbour, is at odds with pro-life

Republicans who accuse him of trying to scuttle the party's pro-life position.

The party's leading spokespeople include vocal abortion supporters like

Christine Todd Whitman, the governor of New Jersey, and William Weld, the

governor of Massachusetts, and its most prominent candidates in last year's

elections--Mitt Romney in Massachusetts, Michael Huffington in California,

George Pataki in New York--all declared themselves pro-choice. <p>



It would be hard to find any Republican seriously seeking national office today

who would say of abortion what Lincoln said of slavery: "The Republican Party

think it wrong--we think it is a moral, a social, and a political wrong." Why?

Wasn't it the Republicans who first promised to support a "human-life

amendment" outlawing abortion? Didn't Ronald Reagan often use his bully pulpit

to speak out in behalf of the unborn? Yes--but that was then. In 1980 the

Republicans set out to woo those who were later called Reagan Democrats, and

one of the means was a pro-life plank, designed to counter the plank the

Democrats had put in their platform four years earlier. The wooing worked all

too well. Many of the conservative Catholics and evangelical Protestants who

streamed into the Republican Party in 1980 were ex-New Dealers, and they

retained elements of the old faith. They may have cooled toward the welfare

state, but they were not opposed to the use of government to promote social

goals. Their primary goal, the outlawing of abortion, would itself involve the

use of government; but even beyond that, these new "social conservatives" never

really shared the Republicans' distrust of an activist government. Republican

leaders thus greeted them warily. These Democrats-turned-Republican were seen

to be useful during elections but a nuisance afterward. During the Reagan years

they were given considerable verbal support, which at times greatly helped the

pro-life cause (as, for example, at the UN International Conference on

Population in Mexico City in 1984, when Reagan officials helped push through a

final report stating that "abortion in no way should be promoted as a method of

family planning"), though it never got beyond lip service. During the Bush

Administration even lip service faltered as Republican officials decided that

their party's "big tent" needed to accommodate the pro-choice view. "Read my

lips," Bush said, but he was talking about "no new taxes." Bush's failure to

keep his tax promise was seen as a major cause of his defeat in 1992, but in

the ashes of this defeat lay what Republican leaders took to be a new sign of

hope: they figured they could win elections on tax-and-spend issues as long as

they kept their promises; they didn't need the "social issues" people anymore.

<p>



The Republicans have thus returned to where they feel most comfortable. Back in

the 1880s William Graham Sumner used to say that the purpose of government is

"to protect the property of men and the honor of women." Modern Republicans

would hasten to add "the property of women" to this meager agenda, but the

philosophy is the same. It sees the common good as the sum of individual

private satisfactions. Its touchstone is the autonomous individual celebrated

by John Locke in 





									<!--LINK-->

<A href=http://www.jim.com/jamesd/2ndtreat.html><i>Of Civil Government

</i>(1690)</A>



: "free, equal, and independent" in the state of nature, the

solitary savage enters society only to protect what is his--or hers. Here is a philosophy radically at odds with

pro-life premises. If a woman has an absolute, unqualified right to her

property, and if her body is part of her property, it follows that she has a

right to evict her tenant whenever she wants and for whatever reason she

pleases. This "despotic" concept of individual ownership is Republican, not

Democratic. If Democrats are pro-choice for political reasons, Republicans are

pro-choice in their hearts. Talk radio's greatest Republican cheerleader, Rush

Limbaugh, has also been an outspoken pro-lifer, but even Limbaugh has been

softening that part of his message lately--and small wonder. Here is Limbaugh

castigating the environmental movement: "You know why these environmentalist

wackos want you to give up your car? I'll tell you the real reason. They don't

want you to have freedom of choice." There it is. Freedom of choice: the

philosophical center of modern-day Republicanism. <p>



Well, the reader asks impatiently, if Democrats are pro-choice politically and

Republicans are pro-choice philosophically, what's the point of that pro-life

"campaign statement"? Who is going to adopt it? Perhaps the good folks in some

little splinter party, but who else? I answer as follows: American party

politics is very tricky, at times seemingly unpredictable. Who, in the early

sixties, would have dared to predict that the Democrats would become the

abortion party? But there was a subtle logic at work. By 1964 it was clear that

the Democrats were about to become the civil-rights party. The feminism of the

sixties rode into the reform agenda on the back of civil rights (by the end of

the decade "sexism" had entered most dictionaries as a counterpart to

"racism"), and high on <i>its </i>agenda was not just the legalization but the

moral legitimization of abortion. Nevertheless, it took a dozen years for the

full shift to occur. I think that within the next dozen years the shift could

be reversed. To explain why, I must take a long look backward, to the parties'

respective positions in Lincoln's time. <p>

<b>PRO-LIFE DEMOCRATS</b><p>



IN the 1850s it was not the Republicans but the Democrats who were the

champions of unbridled individualism. As heirs of Andrew Jackson's

entrepreneurialism--and ultimately of Jefferson's distrust of "energetic

government"--the Democrats were wary not only of national action but also of

any concept of the common good that threatened individual or local autonomy. It

was the Republicans, heirs of Whig nationalism and New England

transcendentalism, who succeeded--under Abraham Lincoln's tutelage--in

constructing a coherent philosophy of national reform. In <i>The Lincoln

Persuasion</i> (1993), a brilliant, posthumously published study of Lincoln's

political thought, the political scientist J. David Greenstone traced the roots

of that thought to the communitarian "covenant theology" of seventeenth-century

Puritanism. Lincoln combined this theology, with its emphasis on public duty

and public purpose, with the nationalism and institutionalism of Henry Clay and

other leading Whigs, arriving at a position of "political humanitarianism."

Lincoln's synthesis, Greenstone noted, did not deny the importance of

individual development, but it did assert that "the improvement of individual

and society were almost inseparably joined." Combining moral commitment with

political realism, Lincoln arrived at a concept of the public good that

resonated deeply among northerners, especially those large segments steeped in

the culture of New England. At the time of the Civil War, then, the Democratic

and Republican parties were divided not only on the slavery question but also

on the larger philosophical question of national responsibility. The Democrats

adopted a position of economic and moral laissez-faire, while the Republicans

insisted that on certain questions the nation had to do more than formulate

procedural rules; it had to make moral judgments and act on them.<p>



This philosophical alignment, persisting through the Civil War and

Reconstruction, was blurred during the Gilded Age. Then, over the course of the

next forty years, something surprising happened: the parties reversed

positions. Populist Democrats in the 1890s weakened their party's attachment to

laissez-faire, and after "progressive" Republicans (whose model was Lincoln)

failed to take over their party in 1912, many started moving toward the

Democrats. Woodrow Wilson welcomed them--and so, twenty years later, did

Franklin Roosevelt. By 1936 it was the Democrats who were sounding the

Lincolnian themes of national purpose and government responsibility, while the

Republicans had become the champions of the autonomous individual. Since then

both parties have veered and tacked, sometimes partly embracing each other's

doctrines, but today the congressional parties stand as far apart as they were

at the height of the New Deal. President Clinton may have muddied the waters

with his "me, too, but more moderately" response to Republican retrenchment,

but in Congress the programmatic differences between the parties are spelled

out almost daily in party-line votes reminiscent of the late 1930s. Now as

then, Republicans emphasize the role of government as a neutral rule maker that

encourages private initiative and protects its fruits. Now as then, Democrats

emphasize the role of government as a moral leader that seeks to realize public

goals unrealizable in the private sphere. <p>



If this analysis is correct, it follows that the proper philosophical home for

pro-lifers right now is the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. To test this,

go back to that "campaign statement" I sketched earlier and make one simple

change: substitute the word "racism" for "abortion." Without much editing the

statement would be instantly recognizable as the speech of a liberal Democrat.

Democrats know that racism, like abortion, cannot be abolished by governmental

fiat. But they also know that it is wrong to subsidize racist teachings

publicly or to tolerate racist speech in public institutions or to permit

racist practices in large-scale "private" enterprises. Democrats also insist

that government has a duty to take the lead in condemning racism and educating

our youth about its dangers. In other words, the same formula--grudgingly

tolerate, restrict, discourage--that I have applied to abortion is what liberal

Democrats have been using to combat racism over the past generation. With

abortion, as with racism, we are targeting a practice that is recognized as

"wrong" (Hillary Clinton) and "a bad thing" (Kate Michelman). With abortion, as

with racism, we are conceding the practical impossibility of outlawing the evil

itself but pledging the government's best efforts to make it "rare" (Bill

Clinton <i>et al</i>.). When it comes to philosophical coherence, therefore,

nothing prevents Democrats from adopting my abortion position. Indeed, there is

very good reason to adopt it. <p>



It is, however, politically incorrect. Any liberal Democrat taking this stance

would incur the wrath of the abortion lobbies. Protests within the party would

mount, funding would dry up, connections with the party leadership would be

severed, and there might be a primary challenge. Because politicians do not

court martyrdom, the intimidatory power of these lobbies is formidable.<p>



But no power lasts forever, and power grounded more in bullying than in reason

is particularly vulnerable in our country. Within the liberal left, from which

the Democrats draw their intellectual sustenance, there is increasing

dissatisfaction with the absolutist dogma of "abortion rights." Nat Hentoff, a

columnist in the left-liberal <i>Village Voice</i>, wonders why those who dwell

so much on "rights" refuse to consider the bare possibility that unborn human

beings may also have a few rights. Hentoff, who is a sort of libertarian

liberal, sees a contradiction between abortion and individual rights, but the

socialist writer Christopher Hitchens may actually be more in tune with the

communitarian bent of post-New Deal liberalism in his critique of pro-choice

philosophy. Hitchens caused an uproar among readers and staffers of <i>The

Nation </i>in 1989 when he published an article in which he observed with

approval that more and more of his colleagues were questioning whether "a fetus

is `only' a growth in, or appendage to, the female body." While supporting

abortion in some cases, he insisted that society has a vital interest in

restricting it. What struck him as ironic, and totally indefensible, was the

tendency of many leftists suddenly to become selfish individualists whenever

the topic turned to abortion. <p>



It is a pity that . . . the majority of feminists and their allies have stuck

to the dead ground of "Me Decade" possessive individualism, an ideology that

has more in common than it admits with the prehistoric right, which it claims

to oppose but has in fact encouraged.<p>



Hitchens's critique of the pro-choice position comes from his socialist

premises, but even some liberal critics closer to the center have adopted a

similar view. <i>The Good Society </i>(1991), by the sociologist Robert Bellah

and his associates, reads like the campaign book of a decidedly liberal

Democratic politician, someone who might challenge Bill Clinton from the left

in 1996. The root of what is wrong in America, it says, is our "Lockean

political culture," which emphasizes "the pursuit of individual affluence (the

American dream) in a society with a most un-Lockean economy and government."

When the authors get to the topic of abortion, they again see Lockeanism as the

culprit: it has turned abortion into an "absolute right." In place of this kind

of extreme individualism they suggest we consider the practices of twenty other

Western democracies.<p>



There is respect for the value of a woman's being able to choose parenthood

rather than having it forced upon her, but society also has an interest in a

woman's abortion decision. It is often required that she participate in

counselling; she is encouraged to consider the significance of her decision,

and she must offer substantial reasons why the potential life of the fetus must

be sacrificed and why bearing a child would do her real harm.<p>



Despite its use of the strange term "potential life" (a usage favored by

Justice Blackmun) for a living fetus, Bellah's formulation expresses coherently

what modern liberalism points toward but usually resists at the last minute: a

responsible communitarian position on abortion. It is not the same as my

campaign statement, but it is within debating distance, and setting the two

statements side by side might bring together in civil debate reasonable people

from both sides. <p>



Of course, neither position would pass muster with NARAL,

and other pro-choice absolutists. But at some point, I think, sooner

rather than later, the grip of these lobbies will have to loosen. One lesson of last year's

congressional elections is that the Democratic Party will suffer at the polls

if it is perceived by the public as the voice of entrenched minority factions.

For better or worse, the Republicans articulated a philosophy in 1994, while

the Democrats, by and large, believed that all they had to do was appeal to

"their" people. The party needs to rediscover the idea of a common good, and

the abortion issue may be as suitable a place as any to start. But the

Democrats will first have to break free of the abortion lobbies. That will be a

formidable challenge, though not an impossible one. As the political scientist

Jeffrey Berry has observed, one of the most startling features of modern

American politics is how quickly political alliances can shift. National

politics, Berry writes, no longer works by means of "subgovernments"--cozy

two-way relationships between particular lobbyists and politicians. Today we

live in a world of "issue networks," in which many lobbies vie for attention.

Something like this, I believe, is starting to happen on women's issues. One of

the fast-growing feminist groups in the country right now is 



									<!--LINK-->

<A href=http://ezinfo.ucs.indiana.edu/~ljray/lifelink/ffl/plfem.html>Feminists for Life (FFL)</A>,



 which has offices nationwide and has recently

moved its headquarters to Washington, D.C. Founded in the 1970s by former NOW members who had been

expelled for their pro-life views, FFL supports almost the entire agenda of

feminism--except "abortion rights." Citing the pro-life stands of the founders

of American feminism, including Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton,

they view themselves as reclaiming authentic feminism. Gay-rights groups,

usually allied with the abortion lobbies, now include 





									<!--LINK-->

<A href=http://ezinfo.ucs.indiana.edu/~ljray/lifelink/plagal.html>

PLAGAL</A>,



 the Pro-Life Alliance of Gays and Lesbians. In issue networks,

Jeffrey Berry observes, alliances can be composed "of both old friends and strange bedfellows"; there are "no permanent allies and no permanent enemies." The new pragmatic alliances

of gays and straights, religious believers and secularists, feminists and

traditionalists, may soon be demanding seats at the Democratic table. It would

not be surprising if they were welcomed as liberators by many Democrats who

have been forced to endorse a Me Decade ideology at odds with the spirit of

their party. <p>

<b>PRO-CHOICE 



REPUBLICANS</b><p>



WHAT about the Republicans? Where are they headed? It is hard to say. As

already noted, on a range of domestic issues the party seems to have embraced a

philosophy of possessive individualism that has a distinctly pro-choice ring to

it, and in this respect is no longer the party of Lincoln. Lincoln's

Republicanism, as Greenstone pointed out in <i>The Lincoln Persuasion</i>,

combined a Whiggish sense of national responsibility with a New England ethic

of moral perfection. Then as now, Republicans believed in capitalist enterprise

and fiscal prudence--but in those days they put them in the service of broader

humanitarian goals. "Republicans," Lincoln said, "are for both the <i>man

</i>and the <i>dollar</i>; but in cases of conflict, the man <i>before </i>the

dollar." This was true for a long time in the Republican Party. Theodore

Roosevelt's notion of "stewardship" had traces of the Lincolnian synthesis of

humanitarianism and institutional responsibility; early in this century many of

the Progressives came from Republican backgrounds. Even in the 1950s

Eisenhower's brand of "modern Republicanism" faintly echoed the old tradition

of active government and moral leadership. Someday, I think, it will be

rediscovered. It is a noble tradition.<p>



Right now, though, it is out of season. The Republicans are on a laissez-faire

roll. The strategy of their leaders is to marginalize right-to-lifers, get

their plank out of the platform, and avoid any more messy debates over social

issues. They see a golden opportunity to win more recruits by appealing to

yuppies and other libertarians who hate taxes and welfare but like "abortion

rights." What can be said to these shrewd Republican leaders? In shrewdness and

wiliness it would be hard to match Abraham Lincoln. Let us, then, listen to

Lincoln as he warned against weakening his party's anti-slavery plank in order

to win the votes of "moderates." "In my judgement," he wrote to an Illinois

Republican official in 1859, "such a step would be a serious mistake--would

open a gap through which more would pass <i>out </i>than pass <i>in</i>." And

so today. Many Reagan Democrats came to the Republicans in the 1980s because

their own party deserted them on social issues. If the Republicans do the same,

many will either drift back to the Democratic Party (many of these, remember,

are former New Deal Democrats, rather liberal on economic issues) or join a

third party or simply drop out (many evangelicals were apolitical before Reagan

came along). For every pro-choice yuppie voter the Republicans won, they might

lose two from the "religious right."<p>



In truth, however, no one can be sure about the gains and losses resulting from

one position or another on abortion, and such considerations are beside my main

point, which is this: It is time at last in America for the abortion issue to

be addressed with candor and clarity by politicians of both major parties.

There needs to be <i>engagement </i>on the topic. Right now, as the philosopher

Alasdair MacIntyre puts it, the arguments pro and con on this issue are

"incommensurable" --they sail past each other; the two sides are talking about

different things. Part of the blame for the mindless "emotivism," as MacIntyre

calls it, can be attributed to the more extreme elements in the pro-life

movement, who have stifled reasoned argument with their cries of "Murder!" But

much of it results from the squeamishness of pro-choicers, who simply refuse to

face up to what abortion is. Nervousness, guilt, even anguish, are all hidden

behind abstract, Latinate phrases. Only rarely does reality intrude. That is

why Christopher Hitchens caused such a howl of pain when he published his

<i>Nation </i>article on abortion. His crack about the "possessive

individualism" of pro-choicers undoubtedly caused discomfort, but what must

have touched a raw nerve was his description of abortion itself. After

sympathizing with the emotions of rank-and-file members of the pro-life

movement--with their "genuine, impressive, unforced revulsion at the idea of a

disposable fetus"--Hitchens added, <p>



But anyone who has ever seen a sonogram or has spent even an hour with a

textbook on embryology knows that emotions are not the deciding factor. In

order to terminate a pregnancy, you have to still a heartbeat, switch off a

developing brain and, whatever the method, break some bones and rupture some

organs.<p>



Here, then, is the center of it all. If abortion had nothing to do with the

stilling of heartbeats and brains, there would be no abortion controversy.<p>



Suppose, now, I were to define the controversy in this manner: It is a fight

between those who are horrified by the above-mentioned acts, considering them

immoral, and those who are not horrified and do not consider them immoral.

"Unfair," most pro-choicers would say. "We are also horrified. Have we not said

that we abhor abortion? Have we not called it wrong? Have we not said it should

be rare?" All right, then, let the debate begin: How rare should it be? How can

we make it rare? In what ways, if any, can public institutions be used to

discourage abortion? If abortion means stilled hearts and ruptured organs, how

much of that can we decently permit? <p>



In this debate I have made my own position clear. It is a pro-life position

(though it may not please all pro-lifers), and its model is Lincoln's position

on slavery from 1854 until well into the Civil War: tolerate, restrict,

discourage. Like Lincoln's, its touchstone is the common good of the nation,

not the sovereign self. Like Lincoln's position, it accepts the legality but

not the moral legitimacy of the institution that it seeks to contain. It

invites argument and negotiation; it is a gambit, not a gauntlet. <p>



The one thing certain right now is that the abortion controversy is not going

to wither away, because the anguish that fuels it keeps regenerating. Some

Americans may succeed in desensitizing themselves to what is going on, as many

did with slavery, but most Americans feel decidedly uncomfortable about the

stilled heartbeats and brains of 1.5 million human fetuses every year. The

discomfort will drive some portion of that majority to organize and protest.

Some will grow old or weary, and will falter, but others will take their place.

(I have seen it already: there are more and more young faces in the annual

"march for life.") Pro-life protests will continue, in season and out of

season, with political support or without it. Abortion, a tragedy in everyone's

estimation, will continue to darken our prospect until we find practicable ways

of dealing with it in order to make it rare. But before we can even hope to do

that, we have to start talking with one another honestly, in honest language.

	<font size=5>T</font>hank you for Eric Schlosser's wonderful and poignant

	 article <A HREF="../95nov/strawber.htm">"In the

Strawberry Fields"</A> (November <i>Atlantic</i>). His descriptions of the

backbreaking work and miserable living conditions of migrant laborers should

make us all ask ourselves what we are willing to pay for the free market.

Schlosser writes eloquently about the harsh paradox of the wealth of Orange

County and the poverty of illegal workers. He asks us to re-examine our worship

of the almighty free market and the laws of supply and demand. Thank you for

reminding us that "the market rewards only efficiency" and that "the free

market always seeks a work force that is hungry, desperate, and cheap--a work

force that is anything but free."<p>

<strong>Kate Mahoney</strong><br>

<i>Denver, Colo.</i><p>

	<br><br><br>

	

	<font size=5>I</font> spoke at length with Eric Schlosser during the 

	preparation of "In the

Strawberry Fields," and have a few comments. The article is interesting but

inaccurate, and reflects Schlosser's use of data given to him by the California

Division of Labor Standards Enforcement.<p>

The cases cited in the article are now three years old and are based on events

that never occurred or on conditions that no longer exist.<p>

Schlosser failed to disclose that I had made arrangements for him to speak with

successful strawberry growers who have used Kirk Produce as their commission

merchant for many years. He told me that he failed to follow through on these

important interviews. He was to have met with these growers by himself and to

have asked <i>any </i>questions he desired, either in person or on the

telephone.<p>

I made arrangements for the president of Kirk Produce to speak with Schlosser

at a mutually convenient time. Schlosser never called to confirm a time for

this important interview.<p>

A commission merchant is paid on a per-tray-sold basis and does not share in

the profits obtained by the grower. This is a set amount, not a percentage of

sale. Schlosser might call this practice "sharecropping," but such a

description is surely not apt. When was farming not a "roll of the dice,"

dependent on weather, market conditions, and many other factors?<p>

From the market price growers must deduct the costs of sale to determine

profit. These costs include labor, packaging, fertilizer, fumigation, plants,

ground preparation, irrigation, fuel, utilities, strawberry-commission levy,

possible transportation, insurance (both liability and workers' compensation),

and many other costs both hidden and obvious. Bank or other loans and advances

must also be deducted, and the remainder goes to the grower, who stands to make

or lose  money depending on the market. The commission merchant does not

control market prices but always attempts to sell his principal's commodity for

the highest price attainable--to carry out his fiduciary duties and to maintain

the grower base. Consumers, including Schlosser, have historically demanded

lower and lower prices for fruits and vegetables. They may not buy strawberries

if they think the price is excessive.<p>

Schlosser fails to mention the sworn Warranties of Labor Law Compliance that, I

believe, were included in the contracts mentioned in the article. Each grower

gives Kirk Produce its sworn assurances upon personal knowledge that all labor

laws and regulations have been fully complied with relative to the produce

delivered to Kirk Produce.<p>

My impression is that Schlosser seeks to highlight only serious social and

labor-law abuses by a very few growers in a labor-intensive, high-risk, highly

regulated business participated in by hundreds of thousands of people in an

assembly line from the farm to the table of the consumer.<p>

<strong>Peter M. Gwosdof</strong><br>

<i>Anaheim, Calif.</i><p>

<br><br><br>	

	

	<font size=5>"I</font>n the Strawberry Fields" is distorted reporting and a vilification of

an industry that is generally progressive and responsible. Your reporter was

given substantial information--which he chose not to use--that could have led

to a balanced report of a complex and challenging issue. Instead Eric Schlosser

conveyed the stereotype that all farmers are abusive and all workers are

abused. To say that the industry is founded on the availability of cheap,

illegal labor is grossly unfair to the majority--responsible farmers who obey

the laws, treat their workers with fairness and respect, and provide good

working conditions.<p>

The strawberry industry has been a longtime advocate of strict enforcement of

labor laws in California. We publish bilingual handbooks containing the

fundamental worker-safety and wage requirements to simplify huge and

complicated legal codes. We conduct statewide bilingual seminars to educate

farmers about California's stringent and ever-changing labor standards. And we

conduct bilingual seminars for field supervisors on good management practices

and fair treatment of employees. In addition, we have actively encouraged

more-aggressive enforcement of the laws through meetings with state regulatory

and elected officials, including the state labor commissioner.<p>

The California strawberry industry is far from being a regressive industry

unwilling to adopt new technologies, as the article implies. On the contrary.

The strawberry industry is among the top agricultural industries in providing

research grants to the University of California. From that research have come

strawberry varieties now used throughout the world, water-conserving

drip-irrigation systems (adopted by strawberry farmers in the 1970s), and the

fundamental principles of today's widely touted integrated-pest-management

strategies, first researched by the California strawberry industry in 1962.<p>

Many farmers have survived and prospered by treating their workers well and

producing a high-quality product that sometimes yields a higher price. These

farmers value and respect the work ethic and highly value their employees. But

farmers who complete the arduous and expensive task of complying with

California's complex labor codes are at a serious disadvantage compared with

those who do not. In fact, the only correct conclusion in the article was

buried near the end, where Schlosser wrote, "Philip L. Martin . . . believes

that the most effective way to improve the lives of farm workers is simply to

enforce the existing labor and immigration laws."<p>

On a level playing field the California strawberry industry can and does

compete, with responsible farmers leading the way. In the long term good labor

practices are more productive and profitable. Strict enforcement of existing

laws ultimately creates the conditions necessary for such practices to prevail

in the short term.<p>

We do face competition from Mexico and Central America, where labor is cheaper

and workers are abused, and those workers do find the fields of California

infinitely more desirable. And, yes, that creates an inexorable flow of workers

across the border. But that is not a fault of free markets, and it shows

instead the inherent desirability of free markets and prosperity.<p>

	<i>Eric Schlosser replies:</i><p>

	

	The sharecropping section in my article was based on interviews with

sharecroppers (including a number employed by Kirk Produce), officials at the

California Labor Commission and the U.S. Department of Labor, prominent

strawberry growers, faculty members at the University of California, lawyers

affiliated with California Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA), and dozens of migrant

workers. I did not interview the five sharecroppers whom Peter Gwosdof selected

for me. Nor did I interview the three sharecroppers who are currently suing

Kirk Produce, with the assistance of CRLA, alleging a variety of improper

business practices. Instead I traveled through the countryside around

Watsonville, Salinas, and Santa Maria, visiting sharecropped fields at random.

Every sharecropper I met told me the same basic story, one that contradicts Mr.

Gwosdof's account of how this system works.<p>

While I was in California, I attempted to interview David Kirk, the founder of

the company that bears his name. None of my phone calls was returned. Mr.

Gwosdof seemed a competent spokesman for Kirk Produce. He drafted their

contracts, and for many years now he has defended them in court and otherwise

represented their interests. The California Second District Court of Appeals

has thoroughly rejected the arguments that Mr. Gwosdof makes here, ruling that

Kirk Produce's sharecroppers are not "independent growers" but employees of the

company--as are their migrants. On October 26 of last year the California

Supreme Court upheld that decision, refusing to consider Kirk Produce's

appeal.<p>

David Riggs is correct in noting that California's strawberry industry has been

at the forefront of technological innovation. Research, however, has

principally been aimed at increasing the yield of strawberry plants.

California's strawberry fields are now the most productive in the world. But

high yields create the need for huge numbers of migrants at harvest. Until

machines are invented that can pick strawberries without damaging the fruit or

the plants, human hands will have to suffice. Very little research has been

directed at making such work easier. Ronald Burk and Bob Espinola, the owners

of Gold Coast Farms, in Santa Maria, provide weight-lifting belts to their

strawberry pickers--a low-tech means of reducing the severe back pain caused by

the job. Other growers might follow their example.<p>

I did not assert, nor do I believe, that "all farmers are abusive and all

workers are abused." On the contrary, I listed more than half a dozen companies

(including the largest in the strawberry industry) that treat their workers

well. Nowhere in his letter does Mr. Riggs mention the existence of

sharecropping, a practice that now accounts for perhaps 40 percent of

California's strawberry crop. Some sharecropping arrangements resemble employee

profit-sharing plans; many others are tantamount to debt peonage. If the

California Strawberry Commission truly wants to help growers who play by the

rules, it should take a strong stand against the growers and commission

merchants who benefit from exploiting their sharecroppers.<p>

As for the free market, it should be noted that the state and federal

governments have spent vast sums of money constructing the elaborate

infrastructure that provides water to California's farmers. The irrigation

system of the Central Valley is fed with water from more than 100 dams built

with taxpayer's money, the legacy of a public-works project that has spanned

most of this century. Without these enormous subsidies California agriculture

would not have bloomed. For a small fraction of that cost the farm workers now

sleeping outdoors beneath plastic tarps could be provided with housing. I do

not hold California growers responsible for the appalling living and working

conditions endured by so many of their workers. The blame rests with a society

that profits enormously from the labor of these migrants but remains unwilling

to provide them with basic services, guarantee their legal rights, or even

protect them from attacks by racists and demagogues. The current effort in

Congress to eliminate California Rural Legal Assistance and similar

organizations is just one more shameful episode in the history of this nation's

farm workers.<p>

<font size=5>A</font> few comments on John Spooner's article <A 

HREF="../95nov/bowtie.htm">"Bow 

Ties"</A> (November <i>Atlantic</i>).<p> I once met a fellow at Berghoff's 

Restaurant who was wearing a mink bow tie.  He was a wrinkled, 

liver-spotted old raisin of a man with a buxom young wife, and damn if he 

didn't look <i>cr&egrave;me de la cool</i> in his brown glen-plaid suit, 

tan silk shirt, and little fur tie, even if he did wear the thickest 

glasses I have ever in my life seen.  He said that his brother-in-law (his 

first wife's brother--he was a widower) ran a mink ranch and gave him the 

ties, so this was not the sort of thing in general circulation.  He said 

his favorite tie was of red sable: <i>yum!</i><p> If a man wearing a 

four-in-hand tie takes off his suit coat and rolls up his sleeves to do 

some hefting, he looks mighty foolish with his tie dangling flaccidly in 

front of him.  A man wearing a bow tie with sleeves rolled up looks ready 

to work.<p> There used to be a custom tie shop on the second floor of a 

very old building on Michigan Avenue.  In the late seventies, when 

<i>nobody </i>wore bow ties, I went there looking for a white bow tie.  I 

wanted silk rep, not the white piqu&eacute; that is worn with full dress.  

The fellow who ran the place said he had just the thing.  He took me 

through a room of fabric cutters and seamstresses, into a musty storage 

room stacked to the ceiling with sturdy card-board boxes.  There he dug 

back through three layers of boxes to find a box labeled "Full-Dress/Rep." 

He opened the box and hesitated.  I thought he would cry.  Then he showed 

me--all the ties were yellowed with superannuation.<p> A fellow who lives 

down the street from me wears prissy little silk-print butterfly bow ties 

tied in a loose soft knot.  He says that women always stop to straighten 

bow ties, and he likes the attention.  I hope it helps.<p> In the days when 

he was still a leftist, Lyndon LaRouche wore snappy striped bow ties.  

After turning state capitalist, he took to wearing more "mainstream" ties 

that look suspiciously like polyester.<p> In days past repairmen and 

mechanics wore bow ties because they didn't get caught in the machinery.  

Nowadays repairmen wear odious clip-on four-in-hand ties, and mechanics go 

open-necked.<p> Henry Ford's chief goon, Harry Bennett, wore bow ties 

because you couldn't grab them in a fight.<p> I am a mechanic who still 

gets into tavern brawls now and again.  I wear solid-colored, silk-rep, 

diamond- or blunt-edged bow ties knotted as tight and small as possible: 

real bad-ass ties.<p> <strong>R.  M.  Schultz</strong><br> <i>Chicago, 

Ill.</i><p>



<i>John D. Spooner replies:</i><p>

	

	Everyone, it seems, <i>does</i> have an opinion about bow ties. A doctor called

me to say that he is left-handed and for some reason has to lie down on the

floor whenever he ties a bow. Another man, in the clothing business, called to

tell me that whenever he goes to a party wearing a four-in-hand, he carries a

folded bow in his pocket--"in case the crowd seems to need the bow-tie look."<p>

I'm glad that people seem to be as passionate about bow ties as they are about

the budget battle. Unlike R. M. Schultz, I have never seen anyone wearing a bow

tie in a brawl. But I was dining in a restaurant a few weeks ago when a woman

came up to my table, reached out, and pulled one end of my bow tie, undoing it.

"I've always wanted to do that," she said. "Your article gave me the courage."

She marched away. <i>I wonder what she meant by that?</i> I thought. But at

least I didn't have to lie down on the floor to retie it. Years ago I practiced

until I could tie a bow in the dark.<p>

Themen wear straw cowboy hats or baseball caps, windbreakers on this cool morning,sneakers, and ragged work clothes. The women have scarves and bandannaswrapped over their hair, hung around their necks, and tied across their faces,so that only their eyes can be seen. From a distance they seem draped inbrightly colored veils. Soon a long line of vehicles is double-parked alongHighway 1, awaiting passengers--not the spectacular Highway 1 that hugs thePacific but a less familiar stretch, four miles inland amid the Santa MariaValley, halfway between Los Angeles and Salinas. Here Highway 1 becomesGuadalupe's main drag, lined with Mexican restaurants, boarded-up storefronts,and bars. As dawn approaches, the procession of old Buicks, pickups, ancientschool buses towing portable toilets, and beat-up vans heads for theneighboring fields. A handful of workers walk along the shoulder of the road,silhouetted by headlights. Two young men ride bicycles; most likely they sleptoutdoors.<p></font>When the sun rises from behind the coastal range, crews of thirty assemble atthe edges of huge fields and start picking strawberries, slowly making theirway down the long furrows, hundreds of men and women bent over at the waist,grabbing fruit with both hands. In the early-morning light it looks like ascene out of the distant past, the last remnant of a vanishing way of life--andyet nothing could be further from the truth. <p>	<A HREF="./art/migrant2.htm"><img src="./art/migrant.gif" align=left border=0 hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="(Migrant Worker Photograph)"></A>Twenty years ago there were about 800 acres of strawberries in the Santa MariaValley; today there are about seven times that number. The strawberry is one ofthe most labor-intensive row crops. It is risky and expensive to grow, but itcan yield more revenue per acre than virtually any other crop except marijuana.On the same land outside Guadalupe where family farms raised dairy cows notlong ago, strawberry farms now employ thousands of migrant workers. Most ofthese migrants are illegal immigrants from Mexico, a fact that helps explainnot only California's recent strawberry boom but also the quiet, unrelentingtransformation of the state's rural landscape and communities. <p>Agriculture is still California's largest industry. For more than half acentury California has led the nation in agricultural output; it now producesmore than half the fruits, nuts, and vegetables consumed in the United States.Hundreds of commodities, from the mundane to the exotic, are grown inCalifornia, primarily in the <A HREF="http://www.zilker.net/~hal/apl-us//351200505.gif">Central Valley</A>, an area that contains perhaps thebest farmland in the world. In some respects, however, California agricultureis in decline. The value of its annual output, adjusted for inflation, hasfallen 14 percent over the past two decades. During the 1980s roughly 20,000acres of Central Valley farmland were lost each year to urbanization. Wide-openfields are giving way to subdivisions and strip malls. Water long used forirrigation is being diverted to cities and towns. Improved cooling andtransportation systems have opened the American market to overseas competitors.Air pollution has begun to diminish crop yields. <p>Meanwhile, the fastest-growing and most profitable segment of California's farmeconomy--the cultivation of high-value specialty crops--has also become the onemost dependent on the availability of cheap labor. Nearly every fruit andvegetable found in the diets of health-conscious, often high-minded eaters isstill picked by hand: every head of lettuce, every bunch of grapes, everyavocado, peach, and plum. As the demand for these foods has risen, so has thenumber of workers necessary to harvest them. Of the migrants in Californiatoday, anywhere from 30 percent to 60 percent, depending upon the crop, areillegal immigrants. Their willingness to work long hours for low wages hashelped California to sustain its agricultural production--despite the losssince 1964 of more than seven million acres of farmland. Fruit and vegetablegrowers in the state now rely on a thriving black market in labor--and withoutit more farms would disappear. Illegal immigrants, widely reviled and depictedas welfare cheats, are in effect subsidizing the most important sector of theCalifornia economy. <p>The rise in the number of migrant workers in California, along with the growthin the proportion who are illegal immigrants, reflects a national trend thathas passed largely unnoticed. During the 1960s it was commonly believed thatwithin a decade there would be no more migrant farm workers in the UnitedStates. Experts predicted that technology would soon render migrants obsolete:if a crop could not be harvested mechanically by 1975, it would not be grown inthe United States. Census figures lent support to this scenario. Philip L.Martin is a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Californiaat Davis and one of the nation's foremost authorities on farm-labordemographics. According to his estimates, during the 1920s there were some twomillion migrant farm workers in the United States. During the 1940s there wereabout one million. And during the early 1970s, when <A HREF="http://www.kern.com/~debbie/index2.html">Cesar Chavez's</A>labor-organizing drive among migrant workers was at its height, there were onlyabout 200,000. Then the number began to climb. Today it is impossible to gaugethe size of the migrant work force with any precision, among other reasonsbecause so much of it is composed of illegal immigrants. Martin believes that800,000 to 900,000 migrant farm workers are now employed in the United States.And not only are there far more migrants today but they are being paid farless. The hourly wages of some California farm workers, adjusted for inflation,have fallen 53 percent since 1985. Migrants are among the poorest workers inthe United States. The average migrant worker is a twenty-eight-year-old male,born in Mexico, who earns about $5,000 a year for twenty-five weeks of farmwork. His life expectancy is forty-nine years. <p>The rise of the strawberry industry is in many ways emblematic of changes thatswept California agriculture during the 1980s. The strawberry has become thefocus of a California industry whose annual sales exceed half a billiondollars. American farmers now receive more money for fresh strawberries eachyear than for any other fresh fruit grown in the United States except apples.And strawberry pickers are not only the poorest migrants but also the ones mostlikely to be illegal immigrants. During the recent strawberry harvest I spentweeks traveling through three regions in California where the fruit iscommercially grown, meeting workers, farmers, academics, and farm-laboractivists. My trip took me through the Santa Maria Valley, where rural povertyhas recently become entrenched and where cruel sharecropping arrangements havetrapped farm workers under mountains of debt; through the area aroundWatsonville and Salinas, where about half the state's strawberries are grownand where this year's heavy rains made many hard lives even harder; and throughnorthern <A HREF="http://sddtsun.sddt.com/files/realestate/countymap.html">San Diego County</A>, where the needs of farmers and real-estatedevelopers increasingly conflict, and where a migrant work force lives in ThirdWorld shantytowns within throwing distance of expensive suburban homes. In thestrawberry fields of California, I believe, one may find answers to many of thepressing questions raised by illegal immigration, along with some ethicalquestions that are much more difficult to resolve. <p><strong>THEINDUSTRY:<br>ASHORT COURSE</strong><p><font size=5>A </font><font size=3>strawberry field is not a beautiful sight. It lacks the charm andcharacter of a citrus grove, an apple orchard, or even a field of corn.Strawberries now begin and end in plastic. Before planting, an entire field issealed with plastic sheeting and injected with methyl bromide, a chemical brewthat kills harmful microbes and nematodes. Then the sheeting is removed andworkers install drip-irrigation hoses in the beds, cover the beds with new,clear plastic, and insert the plants through the plastic by hand. This plastichelps retain heat, keeps the soil moist, and prevents erosion. At the end ofthe harvest, workers rip the plants from the ground and throw them away, alongwith the plastic and the drip-irrigation hoses. Second-year plants tend toproduce smaller berries.<p>California did not always dominate American strawberry production. In the early1950s the state was responsible for only a third of the nation's strawberrycrop. Then California strawberry production began to surge, impelled by newgrowing techniques, new plant varieties, and an abundance of inexpensive labor.From 1974 to 1994 California's strawberry output more than tripled; pricesfell, and Americans doubled their consumption of fresh strawberries. Last yearCalifornia shipped 76 million boxes of fresh strawberries (a box, also called aflat or a tray, holds a dozen pints and weighs roughly eleven and a halfpounds), an all-time record. The state now accounts for 80 percent of thestrawberries grown in the United States and about a quarter of the world'scommercial strawberries. <p>In a good year strawberries can be one of the most profitable row crops inCalifornia. But they are also one of the riskiest. The fruit attracts a widevariety of pests, including aphids, eelworms, and red spider mites. Even morethreatening is the weather. No matter how carefully a grower prepares thefield, no matter how well-bred the plants, the size of the harvest will bedetermined in large part by the weather. Ideal growing conditions forstrawberries include cool nights and warm, sunny days, with no wind above fivemiles an hour and no rain once the berries have appeared. Weather that fallsshort of the ideal may quickly and irreversibly damage the crop. Frost can burnthe blooms. A strong wind will rub leaves against the berries, marring theirskin with brown streaks. A heat wave will stunt and soften the fruit. Worst ofall is heavy rain. Strawberries are so fragile that prolonged rain opens smalltears in their skin, and the tears are quickly infected with botrytis, a graymold. A few days of rain can destroy an entire harvest of strawberries. <p>The market for strawberries can prove just as unpredictable and disastrous asthe weather. The perishability of fresh produce exposes growers to considerablerisk. Ten days after a strawberry is picked, it begins to spoil. "I can't stuffmy berries into a silo like a wheat farmer does," one grower told me, "and thenrun computer programs to decide when it's the best time to sell." Wholesaleprices for fresh strawberries fluctuate widely, from $4.00 to $22.00 a box,depending on the quality of the fruit, the supply, the time of year, and allsorts of imponderables. Growers who produce specialty crops do not benefitdirectly from any government price supports. Although the strawberry plants nowgrown in California often produce fruit continuously for nine months, a fourthto a third of the berries reach maturity at the peak of the harvest--a periodthat lasts only a few weeks. A grower has little choice but to accept theprevailing market price for those berries. Strawberries for processing, whicheventually can be stored, sell for about twenty-five cents a pound. <p>The most successful growers cultivate a high-quality strawberry, have enoughcapital to ride out the bad years, and sell their berries through a prominentmarketing consortium. Such growers may earn annual profits of $10,000 to$20,000 an acre. But others often find themselves at the mercy of the weatherand of a volatile free market. As in most fruit and vegetable production, thesteady profits are usually earned by the middlemen--processors, cooling houses,distributors--and not by the growers. In the strawberry industry a grower'sannual losses can be huge. The cost of strawberry production is anywhere from$12,000 to $30,000 an acre. A fifty-acre strawberry farm producing high-qualityberries requires an annual investment of at least $1 million. There is verylittle a grower can do to limit the fixed costs: the payments on the mortgageor lease, for the plants, the pesticides, and the drip-irrigation system. Theonly cost over which a grower can exert any real control is the cost of labor.<p>Many strawberry growers play by the rules and treat their workers well. Indeed,strawberry pickers all aspire to jobs at farms affiliated with DriscollAssociates, where the fields are immaculate and the wages are the highest inthe industry. Other organizations--such as Naturipe, Sweet Darling, Calberi,Figueroa, Gold Coast, and Boskovich Farms--are also highly regarded. It wouldbe wrong to imply that all strawberry growers routinely mistreat their workers;but some do. Since labor costs constitute 50 to 70 percent of the total costsin strawberry production, cutting labor costs can mean the difference between aprofit and a loss, or between a bad year and a disastrous one. The temptationto break the law can be great. The punishments for doing so are rarely applied.And in recent years some growers have shown little self-restraint. <p>One of the easiest ways to reduce labor costs is to keep workers off the books.Growers are often obligated to pay unemployment taxes and workers'-compensationpremiums for each of their employees, in addition to Social Security andMedicare taxes. Paying an "invisible worker" in cash lowers the cost of thatworker by at least 20 percent. Ignoring California's rules aboutovertime--which in agriculture do not apply until the workday reaches tenhours--effectively cuts those wages by 50 percent. And paying less than minimumwage brings the greatest savings of all. The vast number of illegal immigrantsin the migrant work force is an invitation to break the law. They are unlikelyto approach authorities about a violation of the labor code. <p>Sharecropping is the most insidious means by which growers avoid responsibilityfor their workers. The sharecropper is a straw man, an intermediary, usually amiddle-aged farm worker, to whom the grower shifts many of the legal andfinancial risks. Sharecropping has a long history in the strawberry industry.It is a practice that in the past few years has often resembled not so much atype of agricultural production as an elaborate, well-organized fraud. <p><strong>THENEW SERVITUDE</strong><br><p><font size=5>W</font><font size=3>hen I met Felipe (a pseudonym, as are all the other names presented withoutsurnames), he seemed in bad shape. His clothes were dirty and torn, his facehaggard and unshaven. His strawberry field looked like hell too. The rows werelittered with rotting berries, old boxes, and soda cans. There were brokenirrigation hoses; no plastic enclosed the beds. "Too expensive," he told me."The company doesn't pay me enough." Nearby, his workers picked"cat-faces"--small, deformed berries--off second-year plants. Rain hadseriously damaged the field. Felipe was selling his fruit for twelve cents apound. He couldn't understand why the price for strawberries for processing wasso low, but the terms of his sharecropping contract required him to accept it."They use us all year as slaves," he said. "They pay us whatever they want to."He promised to send me legal documents proving his claims. The season was justbeginning, and Felipe was already $50,000 in debt--half of that amount rolledover from last year. He owed the IRS an additional $5,000. "I can't rememberany time I've been in good shape," he said. "I'm always down in the hole."Felipe had been a strawberry picker when his grower approached him one day andasked if he'd like to become a "farmer." Now, after sixteen years as asharecropper, Felipe owns few assets and is ready to quit.<p>Sharecropping has existed in the California strawberry industry throughout thiscentury, rising and falling in popularity according to changes in the law andthe labor supply. At various times the straw men have been calledsharecroppers, sharefarmers, and tenant farmers. The underlying strategy, ofshifting the greatest risks to the farm worker, has only become more refined.During the 1980s sharecropping thrived--not just for strawberries but also forraspberries, snow peas, and squash. Under a typical arrangement a growerassigned a portion of a strawberry field to a farm worker and his or herfamily. Instead of paying them wages, the grower promised to split the profitsfifty-fifty. The sharecropper became the employer of record, responsible forhiring strawberry pickers, paying their wages, withholding their taxes, andchecking their green cards. The grower was responsible for all other productioncosts and for the overall management of the strawberry farm. By setting up farmworkers as supposedly independent operators, growers shielded themselves fromlabor and immigration laws--and from heavy losses. The sharecropper assumed alarge part of the risk. He or she had no way of knowing whether there would beprofits in a given year or whether the grower would share them fairly. <p>A number of hardworking and enterprising sharecroppers managed to succeed underthis arrangement, earning enough money to become growers themselves. These farmworkers turned farmers are now known as <i>mexicanos</i>, and the Figueroafamily of Santa Maria is a notable example. But many sharecroppers did not fareso well. At the end of the year they had often earned less for their effortsthan farm workers paid minimum wage. And sometimes they earned nothing at all.<p>The California Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that sharecropping arrangements inthe pickle industry did not permit growers to ignore the state'sworkers'-compensation laws. Sharecroppers were not independent operators, thecourt said, and growers could not avoid their legal responsibilities simply byinventing a new name for their employees. But after subsiding briefly,sharecropping reappeared a few years ago in the strawberry industry, in a newversion that makes the old one seem enlightened and humane. Behind many of thecurrent sharecropping schemes are growers and former growers determined toeliminate all risk from the business of producing strawberries. Instead ofpaying the operating costs of a strawberry farm, these growers--now calledcommission merchants--lend sharecroppers the money for operating costs atinterest rates as high as 19 percent. Under the old arrangement, if things wentwrong, sharecroppers simply would not be paid for hard work; under the new one,they are being saddled with thousands of dollars of debt. <p>Mike Meuter, an attorney at California Rural Legal Assistance in Salinas,thinks that as much as half of the strawberry acreage in his area, whichincludes Watsonville, is being farmed by sharecroppers. A survey by CRLA staffmembers in Santa Maria found that half to three quarters of the acreage in thevalley is being sharecropped. These estimates may be high, but there is nodoubt that the practice is once again widespread. Jeannie Barrett, a CRLAattorney who has watched sharecropping arrangements come and go around SantaMaria for almost twenty years, thinks the new version is the worst yet. "It'sbasically a form of debt peonage," she says.<p>One of the largest commission merchants is Kirk Produce, which sells freshstrawberries under the brand names Sunshine, Sunrise, and Sundance, andprocessed berries, through a subsidiary, to Borden's, Kraft, Heinz, and Knott'sBerry Farm. The company was founded by David Kirk, a prominent strawberrygrower; a number of the other leading investors are strawberry growers as well.Kirk Produce contracts are such works of art that the lawyer who drafted them,Peter M. Gwosdof, has copyrighted them. In order to demonstrate that thesharecropper is not an employee of Kirk's, the contracts stress that "nopartnership, joint venture, co-farming, tenant farming, or other businessrelationship" has been created. But elsewhere they make clear that when the"Independent Farmer/Grower" leases the land from Kirk and borrows the money tofarm it from Kirk, he or she also must pay for utilities and irrigation throughKirk, grow berries that satisfy the quality demands of Kirk, and sell all thoseberries only through Kirk at a price determined solely by Kirk. Moreover, Kirkhas the right to retake the land at any time and terminate the lease if thesharecropper's farming practices do not meet with Kirk's approval. Terminationof the lease does not eliminate the debt. <p>Most of the sharecroppers who sign these contracts--which can be as long asthirteen pages, single-spaced--cannot read them. The contracts are entirely inEnglish, whereas the vast majority of sharecroppers are Spanish-speaking farmworkers who have little experience with legal documents. One study suggestedthat the average sharecropper outside Watsonville had the equivalent of afifth-grade education. The Kirk contract recommends seeking "independent legaland/or accounting advice" before signing. But the opportunities for upwardmobility are so limited among farm workers, and the desire to have one's ownfarm is so great, that farm workers are eager to sign such agreements. Onlylater do they realize the true cost. <p>Commission merchants have a very good deal. After lending their money to thesharecropper, they get money back in three ways: as payment for servicesrendered (Kirk supplies the plants, fertilizer, insecticides, and packingmaterials), as interest payments, and as repayment of the original loan. Inaddition, commission merchants charge a fee for every box of strawberries soldand often collect a cooling charge of a dollar a box. Sharecroppers must sellall their berries to their commission merchant, regardless of the price beingoffered. Sharecroppers often complain that they are not receiving the fullvalue of their fruit. Often they are right. Every sharecropper I met in SantaMaria was receiving $5.00 a box for fresh berries, though the official marketprice ranged from $8.00 to $14.00 a box at the time. <p>The documents that Felipe later sent me revealed the kind of bookkeeping thatoften takes place. They stemmed from an investigation of his case by the MarketEnforcement Branch of California's Department of Food and Agriculture. Over thecourse of eighteen months a commission merchant named Ag-Mart Produce was foundto have overcharged or underpaid Felipe by $118,320.62. On days when the marketprice for strawberries was $8.75 a box, Felipe sometimes received $7.00, $5.00,or $1.74 for his boxes. On other days the commission merchant sold hundreds ofboxes of Felipe's berries for which Felipe was paid nothing at all. By the timeCalifornia's Department of Food and Agriculture made these findings, Ag-MartProduce had stopped doing business in the state. <p>Some of the worst violations of state and federal labor laws are beingcommitted by sharecroppers overwhelmed by the pressure to repay their debts.Even the most compassionate sharecroppers are in a bind: the workers often haveto be paid at the end of each week, but the commission merchant usually paysfor the sharecropper's berries every three weeks. The commission merchant alsodeducts service charges and interest payments directly from the sharecropper'scheck, so that little money may be left for the workers. As Kirk's attorney,Peter Gwosdof, explained in an interview, Kirk Produce is not a licensed"finance lender"; it obtains funds through a federal land bank, and istherefore exempt from state usury laws. Kirk can charge whatever interest itlikes--though, Gwosdof assured me, Kirk does not profit from these loans. BillHoerger, a CRLA senior attorney, thinks the loans are designed to make thesharecropper appear to be a real businessperson. The commission merchants oftendon't need the loans to be repaid in order to make a profit. Under the oldsystem, such loans were operating costs; under the new one, bad debts make goodwrite-offs at the end of each year. One well-established strawberry grower, whofinds the new sharecropping arrangements despicable, told me there's nothingnew about the scheme. "Read Thomas Hardy's <i>The Mayor of Casterbridge</i>,"he said, "for the best description of how this whole system works." <p>Two years ago California's labor commissioner cited Kirk Produce for failure toobtain workers'-compensation insurance for employees hired by one of itsindependent growers, Rudolfo Contreras. Kirk appealed the citation, claimingthat Contreras was a self-employed businessman who used his own skills tocomplete a job after hiring his own workers and acquiring his own materials.The hearing officer ruled against Kirk, a decision later upheld by asuperior-court judge and a state appeals court. "The [Kirk] agreements affordedContreras no real opportunity to make a profit," the Second District Court ofAppeals concluded. Regardless of what these contracts asserted, Contreras wasessentially "a supervisorial employee"--not a self-employed entrepreneur. Thelarge debts kept Contreras beholden to Kirk, the judges found, and "forcedContreras to do [its] bidding on a long-term basis."<p>Kirk Produce may now seek a review of this decision by the California SupremeCourt. If the courts upholds the ruling that Kirk's sharecroppers are, in fact,employees, and not independent growers, then future litigation may erase theirdebts. Anne Hipshman, the attorney arguing on behalf of the state laborcommissioner, believes that Kirk Produce has trapped these farm workers "in aform of servitude." Gwosdof, Kirk's attorney, denies the charge. He says thatit is in everyone's best interest if the independent grower has a good year,and adds that the company is always on the lookout for "talented, successfulgrowers." <p>Before signing with Kirk, Rudolfo Contreras had no previous experience as agrower or as a businessman of any kind. His agricultural background was gainedpicking apples, cherries, plums, and peaches for three years. During hisvacations he had picked strawberries for a week or two each year. Although hewas an "independent grower" for Kirk Produce, with a debt of about $70,000, hisonly personal assets were a pickup truck and an old tractor, both of unknownvalue.<p>While awaiting a definitive ruling on their status, sharecroppers struggle torepay what they can. Every sharecropper I met was in dire financial straits. Asharecropper often feeds his or her family by listing a phony worker on thepayroll and keeping those wages. Visiting sharecropped fields at random, Iheardthe same story again and again. I saw the same look of fatigue. Pedro was theonly sharecropper I met who didn't seem distraught. He had a soft, round faceand a moustache. He was thirty-six, but looked a decade older. He had pickedstrawberries for eight years, and then driven a truck. He said that one of hisacres had flooded and was now lost for the year. The strawberries on hisremaining thirty-four acres had been damaged by the rain. After six years ofsharecropping Pedro was $125,000 in debt, most of it rolled over. I asked howhe managed to run up so much debt. "I don't know," he said, shrugging. "All Iknow is I owe it." None of these disasters seemed to have affected his cheerfulmood. What mattered most to him was providing work for his migrants and thepride of being his own boss. "I don't care anymore about material things,"Pedro said as he surveyed the workers in his field, and plastic torn from bedsflapped in the wind. "I'm a Jehovah's Witness."<p><p><strong>THESEARCH FOR <br>APEASANTRY</strong><p> <font size=5>C</font><font size=3>alifornia never enjoyed a period in which family farms dominated the ruraleconomy, employing hired hands who could expect someday to own their own land.Its society never remotely resembled the Jeffersonian ideal. Monopolisticpatterns of land ownership established under Spanish and Mexican rule wereunaffected by California's admission into the United States. The vast bonanzawheat farms that emerged in California during the mid-nineteenth century offerthe earliest example of modern American agribusiness, a model soon emulated bythe state's fruit and vegetable growers. California's agricultural potentialseemed limitless. The soil was rich, the climate was almost perfect, and waterfor irrigation was abundant. All the state lacked was an army of laborers toharvest its apples, melons, oranges, and dates. The historian Cletus E. Danielhas called the initial phase of large-scale agriculture in California "thesearch for a peasantry." First Chinese and then Japanese worked the fields,until the Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Gentleman's Agreement of 1907 limitedtheir supply. In the early years of this century Mexicans were hailed as thesolution to California's perennial farm-labor shortages. The Mexican, it wasargued, would not only work hard for low wages whenever needed but also go homewhen no longer required.<p>There was complete freedom of movement between California and Mexico until1929, when undocumented immigration to the United States became a crime--amisdemeanor carrying no legal punishment. By then 70 to 80 percent of themigrant farm workers in California were Mexicans, and the Mexican population ofLos Angeles had grown larger than that of any city in Mexico except thenation's capital. Illegal immigrants from Mexico have long been a mainstay ofCalifornia's rural economy; the proportion of illegals in the state'spopulation is little different today from what it was four decades ago.Midwestern migrant workers, the "Okies" immortalized by John Steinbeck in<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, were a historical anomaly. For nearly eighty yearsthe vast majority of California's migrant workers have been Mexican immigrants,legal and illegal. The nationality of these migrants over generations seems asunvarying as the nature of the work. Most of California's produce is harvestedtoday exactly as it was in the days of the eighteenth-century mission fathers.<p>Machines have been invented to harvest almost every kind of fruit and vegetablegrown in the United States. Such machines are introduced, however, only whenthe cost of mechanization is lower than the anticipated costs of payingmigrants to do the same work. During the 1970s the United Farm Workers achievedgreat success organizing migrants in the California grape and lettuceindustries. The influence of the UFW extended far beyond these crops; simplythe threat of unionization persuaded many growers to raise wages, offerbenefits, and improve working conditions. At about the same time, Californiaadopted some of the most pro-union legislation in the country, guaranteeingfarm workers the right to collective bargaining, a minimum wage, andunemployment compensation. As labor costs increased, mechanization became a toppriority for California growers. But successive Republican governors, GeorgeDeukmejian and Pete Wilson, gutted the Agricultural Labor Relations Board andrelaxed enforcement of the state's tough labor laws. Union workers were fired;illegal immigrants replaced them; and growers avoided prosecution for workplaceviolations by hiding behind the legal fiction that labor contractors andsharecroppers were the actual employers of migrants. Hard-won benefits such assick leave, vacation pay, family housing, and health insurance were eliminated.The living and working conditions of migrants steadily declined. <p>At the beginning of the 1980s the UFW had perhaps 60,000 members. Today it hasbetween 5,000 and 10,000. Migrant workers have become so cheap in California,largely owing to illegal immigration, that they are increasingly being used notjust to pick fruits and vegetables but to pack them as well, right in thefields. Automated packinghouses employing union workers are rapidly going outof business. Instead of the mechanization of California agriculture, aprominent labor expert recently observed, we are witnessing its"Mexicanization."<p><p><strong>LAFRUTA DEL DIABLO</strong><p><font size=5>T</font><font size=3>he San Andreas labor camp is a small slum set amid rolling hills andstrawberry fields not far from Watsonville. For most of the year this bleakcollection of gray wooden barracks has about 350 residents, mainly strawberryworkers and their families, but at the peak of the harvest hundreds more craminto its forty apartments. Last summer there was a major outbreak oftuberculosis at the camp, fueled by crowded living quarters and poor buildingdesign. The bedrooms occupy a central corridor of the barracks; none has awindow. A superior-court judge recently held the landlord responsible formaintaining "a public nuisance" and for violating local fire, health, safety,building, and zoning codes. Nevertheless, the tenants continue to pay $500 amonth for their two-bedroom apartments and feel lucky to have a roof over theirheads. As I walked around the camp, there were children everywhere, running andplaying in the dirt courtyards, oblivious of the squalor.<p>It was mid-April, and heavy rains the previous month had flooded hundreds ofacres, scattering bright-blue plastic barrels from the nearby Smuckers plantacross local strawberry fields and embedding them in the mud. Many fields thathad not been flooded had still been damaged by the rains. The sky was overcast,more bad weather was coming, and a year's income for these workers would bedetermined in the next few months. Half a dozen strawberry pickers, leaningagainst parked cars, told me that at this point in the season they usuallyworked in the fields eight or ten hours a day. Only one of them was employed atthe moment. Each morning the others visited the strawberry farm on a nearbyhillside, inquired about work, and were turned away. The foreman, who had hiredthem for years, said to try again next week. <p>Harvest work in the strawberry fields, like most seasonal farm work inCalifornia, is considered "at will." There is no contract, no seniority, noobligation beyond the day-to-day. A grower hires and fires workers asnecessary, without need for explanation. It makes no difference whether themigrant has been an employee for six days or six years. The terms of employmentare laid down on a daily basis. If a grower wants slow and careful work, wagesare paid by the hour. If a grower wants berries quickly removed from the field,the wages are piece-rate, providing an incentive to move fast. A migrant oftendoes not know how long the workday will last or what the wage rate will beuntil he or she arrives at the field that morning. There might be two weeks often-hour days followed by a week of no work at all, depending on the weatherand the market. <p>This system did not arise because growers are innately mean and heartless.Harvests are unpredictable from beginning to end. Many growers try to guaranteetheir workers a certain amount of income each week. Among other things, itmakes good business sense to have reliable and capable workers returning eachyear. And yet there is no denying where the power lies.<p>The strawberry has long been known to migrants as "<i>la fruta deldiablo</i>"--the fruit of the devil. Picking strawberries is some of thelowest-paid, most difficult, and therefore least desirable farm work inCalifornia. Strawberries are fragile and bruise easily. They must be pickedwith great care, especially those that will be sold fresh at the market.Workers must select only berries of the proper size, firmness, shape, andcolor. They must arrange the berries neatly in baskets to catch the shopper'seye. Learning how to pack strawberries correctly can take weeks. The worker isoften responsible not only for gathering and packing the fruit but also fortending the plants. The drip-irrigation system has to be checked continually.Shoots and runners have to be removed. Rotting berries have to be tossed away,or they will spoil the rest. When a piece-rate wage is being paid, workers mustperform these tasks and pick berries as fast as they can. There is a strongundercurrent of anxiety in a field being harvested at a piece rate. Workersmove down the furrows pushing small wheelbarrows; they pause, bend over, brushaway leaves to their left and right, pick berries, place them in boxes, checkthe plants, and move on, all in one fluid motion. Once their boxes are filled,they rush to have them tallied at the end of the field, rush back, and beginthe process again. <p>Strawberry plants are four or five inches tall and grow from beds eight totwelve inches high. One must bend at the waist to pick the fruit, whichexplains why the job is so difficult. Bending over that way for an hour cancause a stiff back; doing so for ten to twelve hours a day, weeks at a time,can cause excruciating pain and lifelong disabilities. Most strawberry pickerssuffer back pain. As would be expected, the older one gets, the more one's backhurts. Farm workers, like athletes, also decline in speed as they get older.The fastest strawberry pickers tend to be in their late teens and earlytwenties. Most migrants quit picking strawberries in their mid-thirties,although some highly skilled women do work longer. Age discrimination iscommonplace in the fields--it is purely a question of efficiency.<p>The hourly wages paid to strawberry pickers vary considerably, depending on thegrower, the type of berry being picked, the time of year, and, often, the skillof the worker. Wages are higher in Watsonville and Salinas than in southernCalifornia, because of the greater distance from Mexico. Growers producingtop-quality berries for the fresh market may pay as much as $7.00 or $8.00 anhour. At the height of the season, when berries are plentiful and many growerspay a piece rate of $1.25 a box, the fastest workers can earn more than $100 aday. But wages at that level last for only a month or so, and even during thatperiod most workers can't attain them. When a crew of thirty picks at a piecerate, three or four will earn $10.00 an hour, five or six will earn at or belowthe minimum wage, $4.25 an hour, and the rest will earn something in between.<p>The availability of work, not the pay scale, is of greatest concern tomigrants. Despite the hardships that accompany the job, there is an oversupplyof people hoping to pick strawberries. The fear of unemployment haunts all farmworkers in California. Each harvest brings a new struggle to line up enoughjobs for a decent income. The average migrant spends half the year working anda quarter of the year looking for work. <p>Another constant worry is finding a place to sleep. Santa Cruz and Montereycounties have some of the highest housing costs in the country. Long popularwith tourists and wealthy retirees, the area has also begun to attractcommuters from Silicon Valley. The residents of Watsonville and Salinas aredetermined to preserve the local farm economy, despite enormous pressure fromdevelopers. Agricultural land that currently sells for $20,000 an acre could besold for many times that amount if it were rezoned: there are strawberry fieldsoverlooking the Pacific Ocean. The determination to preserve agricultural landhas not, however, extended to providing shelter for agricultural workers. Since1980 the acreage around Watsonville and Salinas devoted to strawberries hasmore than doubled, and the tonnage of strawberries produced there has tripled.But the huge influx of migrant workers to pick these strawberries is forced tocompete for a supply of low-income housing that has been inadequate fordecades. <p>The few remaining labor camps for single men are grim places. Campo El Toro, agroup of whitewashed buildings surrounded by chain-link fences and barbed wire,desolate except for a rosebush in front of the manager's office, looks like aholding pen or an old minimum-security prison. The Englund labor camp isreputed to be one of the best of its kind. Inside the barracks the walls arefreshly painted and the concrete floor is clean. A typical room is roughlytwelve feet by ten feet, unheated, and occupied by four men. Sheets of plywoodseparate the steel cots. For $80.00 a week, a price that most migrants cannotafford, one gets a bed and two meals a day. I have seen nicer horse barns. <p>Migrant workers try to avoid the labor camps for reasons other than cost: therisks of having possessions stolen during the day and of sleeping besidestrangers at night. Whenever possible, migrants stay in residentialneighborhoods. They pool their resources, relying on relatives and friends. InWatsonville three or four families will share a small house, seven or eightpeople to a room. Migrants routinely pay $100 to $200 a month to sleep in agarage with anywhere from four to ten other people. A recent survey of garagesin Soledad found 1,500 inhabitants--a number roughly equal to a quarter of thetown's official population. At the peak of the harvest the housing shortagebecomes acute. Migrants at the San Andreas labor camp sometimes pay to sleepthere in parked cars. The newest migrant workers, who lack family in the areaand haven't yet learned the ropes, often sleep outdoors, in the wooded sectionsof Prunedale, trespassing, moving to a different hiding place each night. A fewyears ago, on hillsides above the Salinas Valley, hundreds of strawberrypickers were found living in caves.<p><p><strong>LOCKEDINTO <br>DEPENDENCE</strong><p><font size=5>T</font><font size=3>he immigration history of Guadalupe, California, can be read in the names andfaces adorning headstones in its small cemetery. The Swiss and Italian andPortuguese surnames belong to families that settled in the Santa Maria Valleyaround the turn of the century, growing beans and sugar beets, running cattle,and raising dairy herds. The Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino names belong tothe first wave of farm workers, some of whom managed to acquire land of theirown. Spanish surnames greatly outnumber the rest, marking the recent gravesalong with plastic flowers and images of saints. There is a sepulchral customin Guadalupe, practiced for generations: most of the headstones bearsepia-tinted photographs of the deceased. Walking through the graveyard, onesees at a glance the slightly different ethnic traits and the subtle variationsin skin color--long the basis of economic status and rivalry. Now all thesefaces stare in the same direction from the same place, arranged like crops inlong, straight rows.<p>For most of this century the Santa Maria Valley had a diverse farm economy.Although migrants were a large seasonal presence, the area lacked the hugeindustrial farms that dominated the landscape elsewhere in California. Theacreage around Guadalupe was devoted primarily to field crops and irrigatedpasture. The cattle ranches and dairy farms were owned and managed by localfamilies. Fruits and vegetables, though an important source of revenue,occupied a small portion of the agricultural land. <p>Then, from the early 1970s to the late 1980s, the Santa Maria Valley wastransformed. As field crops and dairy products became less profitable, farmerseither switched to high-value specialty crops or quit farming. Much of the landin the valley was bought by outside corporations, such as Mobil and the Bank ofAmerica. Irrigated pastures became strawberry fields (dotted with oil wells) onleased land. The number of migrant workers soared. In 1960 Guadalupe'spopulation was 18 percent Latino; today it is more than 83 percent Latino. Themiddle classes fled to the nearby city of Santa Maria, leaving behind a ruralunderclass. Half the families in Guadalupe now live below the poverty line. <p>Juan-Vicente Palerm has spent the past twelve years studying the social andeconomic changes in the Santa Maria Valley. The director of the University ofCalifornia's Institute for Mexico and the United States, Palerm is ananthropologist by training; his early fieldwork traced the lives of Spanishguest workers in northern Europe--migrants imported by treaty to labor infactories and fields. He is an imposing figure, with the graying beard of apatriarch, and has a remarkable grasp not only of labor-market dynamics butalso of how every crop in the valley is planted, tended, marketed, and sold. Ispent a day with Palerm and one of his graduate students, Manolo Gonzalez (whopicked strawberries for a year as part of his research), driving the sidestreets of Guadalupe, touring the fields, and discussing how the growers ofCalifornia and the peasants of rural Mexico created an agricultural system thathas locked them into mutual dependence. <p>By relying on poor migrants from Mexico, California growers established a wagestructure that discouraged American citizens from seeking farm work. The wagesoffered at harvest were too low to sustain a family in the United States, butthey were up to ten times as high as any wages Mexican peasants could earn intheir native villages. A system evolved in which the cheap labor of Mexicanmigrants subsidized California agriculture, while remittances from that farmwork preserved rural communities in Mexico that might otherwise have collapsed.For decades the men of Mexican villages have traveled north to the fields ofCalifornia, leaving behind women, children, and the elderly to look after theirsmall farms. Migrant work in California has long absorbed Mexican surpluslabor, while Mexico has in effect paid for the education, health care, andretirement of California's farm workers. <p>Whenever migrants decided to settle in California, however, they disrupted thesmooth workings of this system, by imposing higher costs on thestate--especially if they married and raised children. That is why theImmigration and Naturalization Service has traditionally rounded up anddeported illegal immigrants in California immediately after the harvest.Nevertheless, millions of Mexican farm workers have settled in the UnitedStates over the years, many of them becoming American citizens. Althoughagricultural employment has long been a means of entering U.S. society, lowwages and poor working conditions have made it an occupation that mostimmigrants and their children hope to escape. Farm labor is more physicallydemanding and less financially rewarding than almost any other kind of work. Amigrant who finds a job in a factory increases his or her income fourfold. As aresult, the whole system now depends on a steady supply of illegal immigrantsto keep farm wages low and to replace migrants who have either retired toMexico or found better jobs in California. <p>Juan-Vicente Palerm believes that today there are not only more migrantsshuttling back and forth from Mexico but also more Mexican farm workerssettling permanently in California. Throughout the state towns like Guadalupe,Calexico, Cutler, and McFarland are becoming enclaves of rural poverty. In theSanta Maria Valley the increased production of fruits and vegetables, higheryields per acre, and an extended growing season have created thousands of full-and part-time jobs for farm workers. Broccoli fields now occupy more than20,000 acres, requiring a large supply of resident workers for a staggeredharvest that lasts most of the year. Celery and cauliflower production havealso increased the number of reliable jobs. Perhaps 40 percent of the farmlabor in the valley is currently performed by workers who live there. Many farmworkers now own houses. A privileged few may earn as much as $50,000 a year.But the strawberry fields have drawn thousands of poor migrants to the area.Only 12 percent of the work force at a strawberry farm can claim year-roundemployment. And cultivating the fruit is so labor-intensive--twenty-five timesas labor-intensive as cultivating broccoli--that strawberry production nowemploys more farm workers than the production of all the vegetables grown inthe valley combined. Most strawberry pickers hope to find jobs in the nearbyvegetable fields, where the wages are better and the work is less arduous.Turnover rates are extremely high in the strawberry work force. But there is noimpending shortage of potential migrants. The rural population of Mexico hastripled since the 1940s, and now stands at roughly 30 million. "In terms ofabsolute numbers," Palerm says, "there are far more Mexican peasants today thanever before."<p>A growing proportion of the strawberry pickers in the Santa Maria Valley areMixtec Indians--some of the poorest and most exploited people in thishemisphere. Soil erosion and declining crop yields in the mountains of westernOaxaca have forced the Mixtecs to become migrant workers. According to MichaelKearney, a professor of anthropology at the University of California atRiverside, their choice is simple: "Migrate or starve." Mixtec Indiansincreasingly dominate the lowest-paid jobs in California agriculture. InTijuana you often see the wives and children of Mixtec farm workers, small anddark and beautiful, dressed in the bright colors of their native villages,selling Chiclets to tourists on the street.<p>Until the late 1970s almost all the Mexican farm workers in California weremestizos with strong cultural links to communities already in the state. Thenew migrants present social workers with unusual challenges. In addition to theninety-two dialects of Mixtec, there are at least half a dozen otherpre-Columbian languages spoken by the indigenous peoples of Oaxaca. Perhaps afifth of the Mixtec farm workers in California speak no English or Spanish.Throughout their migratory route Mixtecs are the victims of robbery anddiscrimination. In central Mexico they must run a gantlet of officialsdemanding bribes. In Tijuana they are preyed upon by smugglers, rapists, andthieves. In San Diego County they have been the targets of "beanerraids"--random beatings administered by white teenagers from the suburbs and byMarines from Camp Pendleton.<p>In Guadelupe many of the settled farm workers resent the new arrivals fromOaxaca. Illegal immigrants often crossed picket lines during the 1980s, helpingto drive the UFW from the valley. Hourly wages have declined by 40 percent overthe past decade, and there is widespread underemployment. Labor contractors nowactively recruit illegals, who work for less money and raise fewer objectionsthan legal residents. At harvest time Guadalupe's population of 5,500 swells byas much as half, placing great demands on local services. Palerm's researchersonce discovered twenty-two people living in a two-bedroom apartment. The citygovernment is bankrupt. Last year much of Guadalupe's housing for migrants wasrazed or condemned. Local officials hope to turn Guadalupe into a touristattraction, an authentic "Mexican" town. The bars and cantinas along Highway 1have been repainted, and destitute migrants, who might scare away the tourists,have been strongly encouraged to go elsewhere.<p>Despite the hardships of their long journey, Mixtecs hoping to sustain theirnative villages have a strong incentive to find work in California. Wages inOaxaca are about two or three dollars a day. Wages in the strawberry fields ofBaja California are about five dollars a day. A Mixtec farm worker in the SantaMaria Valley, making ten dollars an hour at the peak of the strawberry harvest,can earn more in one day than he or she could earn back home in a month. <p><p><strong>ARELIANCE <br>ONMISFORTUNE</strong><p><font size=5>I</font><font size=3>n 1951 the President's Commission on Migratory Labor condemned the abysmalliving conditions of illegal immigrants employed as migrant farm workers in theUnited States. At the time, workers were found living in orchards andirrigation ditches. They lived in constant fear of apprehension, likefugitives, and were routinely exploited by their employers, who could maintainunsafe working conditions, cut wages, or abruptly dismiss them with little fearof reprisal. In many cases the life of these migrants was, according to thecommission, "virtually peonage." The commission estimated that 40 percent ofthe migrants in the United States--at least 400,000 people--were illegalimmigrants. Their presence in such large numbers depressed wages for all farmworkers; that was "unquestionable." Indeed, illegal immigrants had begun todisplace native workers not only in agriculture but also in nonfarm occupationssuch as construction. The commission argued that the only way to stop the flowof illegals was to impose harsh punishments on those who employed and exploitedthem. It suggested fines, imprisonment, and a strict prohibition of interstatecommerce in any goods produced or harvested by illegal immigrants. "We dependon misfortune to build up our force of migratory workers," the commissionconcluded, "and when the supply is low because there is not enough misfortuneat home, we rely on misfortune abroad to replenish the supply."<p>Congress ignored the commission's recommendations, and for the next two decadesit was a crime to be an illegal immigrant in the United States but not a crimeto employ one. In 1986 Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act(IRCA), which demanded broad sanctions against the employers of illegalimmigrants. But these sanctions have rarely been applied. There areapproximately 873,400 private employers in California--and only about 200federal inspectors to investigate workplace violations of the immigration code.Moreover, the federal penalties for employing an illegal immigrant are mild. Afirst offense may result in a fine of $250, a third offense in a fine of$3,000. Instead of stemming illegal immigration, IRCA has actually encouragedit. In response to growers' fears that the new sanctions on employers wouldcreate a shortage of farm workers, Congress included in the bill a specialamnesty for illegal immigrants who could prove that they had done farm work inthe United States during the previous year. It did not demand much proof.Backed by Congressman Leon Panetta and Senator Pete Wilson, both fromCalifornia, the Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) program was expected to grantlegal status to 350,000 illegal immigrants. Instead more than 1.3 millionillegal immigrants--a number roughly equivalent at the time to a sixth of theadult male population of rural Mexico--applied for this amnesty, most of themusing phony documents in what has been called one of the greatest immigrationfrauds in American history. More than a million illegal immigrants wereeventually granted legal status; many were soon joined illegally by their wivesand children. Instead of shrinking the farm-labor force, IRCA has guaranteed anoversupply of workers. Counterfeit green cards, Social Security cards, driver'slicenses, and SAW work histories--the documents necessary to obtain employmentas a farm worker--can be easily obtained in rural California for $50.00. Theprocess usually takes about an hour. <p>Pete Wilson, now the governor of California and a candidate for President ofthe United States, has lately expressed support for a new guest-worker program,one that would openly recruit migrant workers through a formal agreement, andwould guarantee their wages, their living conditions--and their return toMexico at the end of each year's harvest. The U.S. government operated asimilar endeavor, called the Bracero Program, from 1942 to 1964. Migrants whoenrolled were shuttled to huge holding pens at the border, forced to awaitemployment with numbers hung around their necks, and then stripped naked andsprayed with a delousing agent before being allowed entry into the UnitedStates. Once in this country, the braceros were all but powerless and werebound to a single employer. The Bracero Program was terminated amid revelationsthat its guest workers were being widely abused. Historians now agree that theprogram established the social networks and migratory patterns responsible forthe subsequent waves of illegal immigration. Indeed, during the program'sexistence there were often more illegal immigrants than braceros employed inAmerican agriculture. <p>Despite all these facts, Juan-Vicente Palerm does not rule out lending hissupport to a new guest-worker program. He has no illusions about sucharrangements, having witnessed their implementation in Western Europe duringthe 1960s, their successes and ultimate failure. His willingness to consider aguest-worker program today is based on pragmatism. The living conditions ofmigrants in California have become so bad that something must be done atonce--and a guest-worker program, while no solution, is at least a first step.The North American Free Trade Agreement permits the free movement of Americancapital across borders without offering any legal protection to Mexican migrantworkers. Palerm believes that the terms of a guest-worker program couldguarantee migrants some of the basic rights they do not enjoy today. Even ifillegal immigration continues alongside the officially approved migration,those farm workers within the program will no longer have to live underground.Palerm is organizing a community-based coalition in the Santa Maria Valley toaddress problems facing new immigrants and rural youth. Growers, farm workers,teachers, health workers, and other citizens from Guadalupe are joining to findsome common ground. <p>Opponents of guest-worker programs have long based their objections to them onprinciple. More than a decade ago Sidney Weintraub and Stanley R. Ross, then atthe University of Texas, asserted that "guest worker" is simply a moderneuphemism for an indentured laborer. A guest-worker program legally embracesthe concept of second-class citizenship, creating a group of people in thiscountry who have limited rights. Aside from the philosophical objections thatcan be raised, many argue that such programs simply don't work. "There'snothing more permanent," one economist has said, "than temporary workers."Guest-worker programs were discontinued in Europe because large numbers ofAlgerian, Moroccan, and Turkish workers chose to settle instead of returninghome. <p>Leo Chavez, a professor of anthropology at the University of California atIrvine, thinks that Governor Wilson's anti-illegal-immigration campaign and hisplan for a new guest-worker program share an underlying rationale. The authorof <i>Shadowed Lives</i> (1993), a study of the role illegal immigrants nowplay in the San Diego economy, Chavez finds it ironic that young Mexican menare to be actively recruited for work in California while Mexican women andchildren are to be expelled. "It's quite simple,"he says. "The state wantstheir production, but not their reproduction."<p>Mexican farm workers have long dominated the agricultural labor force inCalifornia and the Southwest, but only recently have they begun to migratethroughout the United States. Mexican farm workers, many of them illegalimmigrants, are now picking raspberries in Oregon, detasseling corn in Iowa,harvesting tobacco in Virginia, and tending plants in New Jersey nurseries.Moreover, the same method long used to employ illegal immigrants in Californiaagriculture--the reliance on intermediaries, such as labor contractors--isbeing used to employ them in construction work, janitorial service, and thegarment industry. The majority of illegal immigrants in California now work innonfarm occupations and come from regions throughout Mexico, including MexicoCity. Michael Kearney anticipates that the indigenous people of Chiapas willsoon join Mixtecs in the migratory stream. Farm-union organizers stronglyoppose a new guest-worker program, while others ask why the government shouldserve as a labor contractor for agricultural interests, when nonfarm industriesare just as eager to hire low-wage workers. A guest-worker program isunnecessary, opponents say, when so many farm workers already in the UnitedStates are struggling to find work. <p>Philip L. Martin, who served for four years as a member of the Commission onAgricultural Labor, a group mandated by IRCA, believes that the most effectiveway to improve the lives of farm workers is simply to enforce the existinglabor and immigration laws. Lax federal enforcement has amounted to atremendous subsidy for fruit and vegetable growers, one that has distorted theeconomics of those industries. "Cheap labor benefits agriculture in the shortrun,"Martin argues. "But it also helps to blind farmers to the technologicalchanges they will have to make in order to compete with foreign producers, whohave access to even cheaper labor." As long as the United States tolerates theemployment of illegal immigrants in agriculture, Martin believes, thefarm-labor market will continue the endless cycle in which farm workers quitfor better jobs and illegals arrive to replace them. "We have essentiallyprivatized the immigration policy of this country," Martin says, "and left itin the hands of California's growers."<p>Joaquin Avila, a former president of the Mexican-American Legal Defense andEducational Fund, thinks the distinction between legal and illegal farm workersis less important at this point than the level of wages being paid. Thelabor-market interdependence of the United States and Mexico, a relationshipthat evolved over decades, cannot be severed overnight. Until economicdevelopment in Mexico has diminished the underlying need for migration, hesays, the emphasis within the United States should be on making sure that allworkers, regardless of their nationality, are paid a decent wage and protectedfrom exploitation. Doubling the minimum wage would help farm workersenormously, says Marc Linder, a professor of law at the University of Iowa whohas long represented migrants. Over the past eight years the minimum wage hasdeclined in value by 33 percent. Doubling it would end a great deal of miserywhile adding little to the retail cost of most fruits and vegetables. <p>Despite the many policy options regarding farm workers, the most likelyscenario is that nothing will be done--or that things will get much worse. Thenew Republican leadership in Congress has vowed to cut off all federal fundingfor legal-services organizations like CRLA by 1997 and wants to restrict thetypes of cases they can handle. The House majority leader, Dick Armey, hopes toeliminate the minimum wage. The plight of migrant workers has been deplored bypresidential commissions and congressional subcommittees for nearly a century,and yet little has fundamentally changed. Growers still exercise a great dealof political influence, while farm workers possess virtually none. Except for aflurry of attention every few decades, the American people have greeted thewhole subject with indifference. The nation's fresh produce is less expensiveas a result--but not much. Maintaining the current level of poverty amongmigrant farm workers saves the average American family about $40.00 a year.<p><p><strong>BOWINGDOWN <br>TOTHE MARKET</strong><p><font size=5>O</font><font size=3>ne morning in San Diego County, I met a strawberry grower named Doug. We satand talked in a trailer on the edge of his field. Doug's father and grandfatherwere both sent to an internment camp for Japanese-Americans during the SecondWorld War. Upon their release the grandfather bought a used truck. At first heworked for other farmers; then he leased some land. Doug's grandfather spoke noEnglish, and so Doug's father, still a teenager, assumed an important role inthe business. The two grew vegetables with success and eventually shifted tostrawberries, shipping and processing the fruit as well. On the land wheretheir original farm once stood, there are now condominiums, a park, and aschool. Doug grows strawberries a few miles inland. His fields are surroundedby chain-link fences topped with barbed wire. An enormous real-estatedevelopment, with hundreds of Spanish-style condo units, is creeping up thehills toward his farm. Many of the farmers nearby have already sold their land.Doug has spent most of his life in strawberry fields, learning every aspect ofthe business firsthand, but now he isn't sure he wants his children to do thesame.<p>"Farming's not a glamorous business," Doug said. "Farmers don't have a highstatus in this community. In fact, we're resented by most people." With all thehassles today from the state and from his neighbors, he sometimes asks himself,"Hey, why do this?" He worries about water costs, about theft, about thestrawberries from New Zealand he saw in the market the other day. This year'srain wiped out a quarter of his early-season berries, just when the marketprice was at its peak. Doug cannot understand the hostility toward growers inCalifornia. After all, agriculture preserves open land. He thinks Americansdon't appreciate how lucky they are to have cheap food. He doesn't understandwhy anyone would impede strawberry production by limiting his access tomigrants. "My workers are helping themselves," he said. "I respect thesepeople. They work damn hard. And my jobs are open to anyone who wants toapply." Every so often, he said, college kids visit the farm, convinced thatpicking strawberries would be a nice way to earn some extra money. Douglaughed. "They don't last an hour out here."<p>We stepped from the trailer into bright sunshine. Workers moved down thefurrows under close supervision. Doug takes great pride in being athird-generation grower. He is smart, well-educated, and meticulous, and itshowed in his field. But I wondered if Doug and his workers would still bethere in a few years.<p>Doug picked a berry and handed it to me, a large Chandler that was brilliantlyred. I took a bite. The strawberry was warm and sweet and fragrant, with aslightly bitter aftertaste from the soil. <p>That evening Iinadvertently met some of Doug's workers. Ricardo Soto, a younglawyer at CRLA, had brought me to the edge of an avocado orchard to visit ahidden encampment of migrant workers. Perhaps half the migrants in San DiegoCounty--at least 14,000 people--are now living outdoors. The shortage oflow-income housing became acute in the early 1980s, and large shantytowns beganto appear, some containing hundreds of crude shacks. As suburbs encroached onagricultural land in northern San Diego County, wealthy commuters andstrawberry pickers became neighbors. At one large shantytown Ivisited, womenwere doing their laundry in a stream not far from a walled compound with tenniscourts, a pool, and a sign promising COUNTRY CLUB LIVING.<p>The suburbanites do not like living beside Mexican farm workers. Instead ofproviding low-income housing, local authorities have declared states ofemergency, passed laws to forbid curbside hiring, and bulldozed many of thelarge encampments. San Diego growers appalled by the living conditions of theirmigrants have tried to build farm-worker housing near the fields--only toencounter fierce resistance from neighboring homeowners. Although theshantytowns lower nearby property values, permanent farm-worker housing mightreduce property values by an even greater amount. "When people find out youwant to build housing for your migrants," one grower told me, "they just goballistic."<p>The new encampments are smaller and built to avoid detection. At the end of adriveway, near a chain-link fence, Imet a young Mixtec who lived in such anencampment. His name was Francisco, and he was eighteen years old. He lookeddeeply exhausted. He had just picked strawberries for twelve hours at Doug'sfarm. Iasked what he thought of Doug as a boss. "Not bad,"he said politely.<p>The previous year Francisco had picked strawberries from April until July. Hehad saved $800 during that period and had wired all of it to his mother andfather, in the village of San Sebasti&agrave;n Tecomaxtlahuaca. This wasFrancisco's second season in the fields, but he had not seen much of San DiegoCounty. He was too afraid of getting caught. His days were spent at the farm,his nights at the encampment. He picked strawberries six days a week, sometimesseven, for ten or twelve hours a day. "When there's work," Francisco said, "youhave to work." Each morning he woke up around four-thirty and walked for halfan hour to reach Doug's field.<p>At dusk thirteen tired men in dirty clothes approached us. They were all fromFrancisco's village. They worked together at Doug's farm and stayed at the sameencampment. They knew one another's families back home and looked after oneanother here. The oldest was forty-three and the youngest looked about fifteen.All the men were illegals. All were sick with coughs, but none dared see adoctor. As the sun dropped behind the hills, clouds of mosquitos descended, andyet the migrants seemed too tired to notice. They lay on their backs, on theirsides, resting on the hard ground as though it were a sofa.<p>Francisco offered to show me their encampment. We squeezed through a hole inthe chain-link fence and through gaps in rusting barbed wire, and climbed awinding path enclosed by tall bushes. It felt like a medieval maze. As weneared the camp, I noticed beer cans and food wrappers littering the ground. Wecame upon the first shack--short and low, more like a tent, just silver trashbags draped over a wooden frame. A little farther up the path stood three moreshacks in a small clearing. They were built of plywood and camouflaged.Branches and leaves had been piled on their roofs. The landowner did not knowthe migrants lived here, and the encampment would be difficult to find. Thesemigrants were hiding out, like criminals or Viet Cong. Garbage was everywhere.Francisco pointed to his shack, which was about five feet high, five feet wide,and seven feet long. He shared it with two other men. He had a good blanket.But when it rained at night, the roof leaked, and the men would go to worksoaking wet the next day and dry off in the sun. Francisco had never lived thisway before coming to San Diego. At home he always slept in a bed. <p>Beyond the sheds bushes crowded the path again, and then it reached anotherclearing, where two battered lawn chairs had been placed at the edge of thehill. There was a wonderful view of strawberry fields, new houses, and thelights of the freeway in the distance. <p>Driving back to my motel that night, I thought about the people of OrangeCounty, one of the richest counties in the nation--big on family values, nowbankrupt from financial speculation, unwilling to raise taxes to pay for theirown children's education, unwilling to pay off their debts, whining about theinjustice of it, and blaming all their problems on illegal immigrants. And Ithought about Francisco, their bogeyman, their scapegoat, working ten hours aday at one of the hardest jobs imaginable, honest work, and sleeping on theground every night for months so that he could save money and send it home tohis parents.<p>We have been told for more than a decade to bow down before "the market." Wehave placed our faith in the laws of supply and demand. What has beenforgotten, or ignored, is that the market rewards only efficiency. Every otherhuman value gets in its way. The market will drive wages down like water, untilthey reach the lowest possible level. Today that level is being set not inWashington or New York or Sacramento but in the fields of Baja California andthe mountain villages of Oaxaca. That level is about five dollars a day. Nodeity that men have ever worshiped is more ruthless and more hollow than thefree market unchecked; there is no reason why shantytowns should not appear onthe outskirts of every American city. All those who now consider themselvesdevotees of the market should take a good look at what is happening inCalifornia. Left to its own devices, the free market always seeks a work forcethat is hungry, desperate, and cheap--a work force that is anything but free. </blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

<b><i><font size=4>Poet and critic, Whitney Balliet reminds us that with

the advent of the tape recorder and the long-playing record, jazz, which is

the most evanescent of modern music, becomes a permanent part of our musical

library. A native of New York now in his twenty-eighth year, Mr. Balliett joined

the editorial staff of <i>The New Yorker</i> shortly after his graduation

from Cornell.</i></b></font>

<font size=5>A</font>MERICAN jazz is in a peculiar but encouraging position today. Loved all over

the world, it is still regarded as somewhat of a black sheep at home, even

though it has become a familiar fixture in our concert halls, on records, on

the radio, and in the movies during the past ten years. Among the archest of

the highbrows it is still deprecated; among the lower highbrows it is taken as

a kind of new bibelot to be trotted out for informed cocktail chatter. The

public at large, which once looked upon it, through no fault of its own, as a

dangerous aphrodisiac, or as some sort of mysterious African bongo-wongo music

that set its listeners to jumping and bumping like fleas in a box, now

knows--even if it has not made heroes of them--who Louis Armstrong, Duke

Ellington, Benny Goodman, and Gene Krupa are. And its appreciators in this

country and abroad have grown numerous enough and solid enough to be able to

articulate their feelings through several national and international jazz

clubs, and to support a variety of magazines here and in other countries

devoted to the interpretation and review of jazz.<p>



<p>



But if jazz is in a sort of halfway house, in so far as the world is concerned,

the music itself is in a vigorous, sound condition. One reason for this

heartening fact is the recent revolution--called variously, kloop mop, re-bop,

bebop, and cool music--which jazz has successfully and fruitfully weathered;

and the other is the emergence and widespread use of the LP record, which, with

its fifteen to twenty minutes of uninterrupted playing time per side, presents

enlarged possibilities for capturing more live jazz, and for greater musical

experimentation on studio recording dates.<p>



<p>



Up until six or seven years ago, when the tape recorder and the LP came into

wide use in this country, recorded jazz had been set in the strict

three-to-five minute mold of the 78 rpm 10- and 12-inch record. This was in a

sense crippling and prohibitive, for jazz is a fluid, inspirational music,

which, having stated its particular theme--whether it be in the form of

Dixieland, Swing, or bop--can grow and develop in direct ratio to the amount of

space for variations it is accorded.<p>



<p>



The recording as a means of reproduction and preservation is far more vital to

an improvisational music like jazz than it is to, say, classical, band, or show

music. Every performance of a symphony or Sousa march is pretty much like the

last. But jazz is perishably ephemeral, elusive. When a jazz band plays a

number, the particular combination of sounds that emerge will be ones that have

never been heard before and will never be heard again unless, of course, those

sounds are recorded.<p>



<p>



Because of this inherent peculiarity and because of the one-time lack of proper

on-the-spot facilities for recording live jazz, a good deal of wonderful music

has, regrettably, passed into thin air. I recall one night at the now defunct

Ken Club in Boston during the winter of '43 or '44 hearing Wild Bill Davison,

the trumpeter, launch into six consecutive choruses of "Body and Soul." It was

superb jazz, but I could not whistle a bar of it now.<p>



<p>



With the tape recorder and the LP (for commercial reproduction), much of this

waste can be avoided. Live, off-the-cuff jazz--in night clubs, at jam sessions,

in the big ballrooms, and on the concert stage--can be brought conveniently

into the home. Jazz played under such conditions is often rough,

exhibitionistic, and mechanical, to be sure, but the occasional inspirational

heights prompted in the musicians by one another and by an appreciative

audience usually more than balance these flaws. (The now famous Benny Goodman

Carnegie Hall concert is a fine illustration of the immeasurable value of

recording live material. When the band was winding up the evening with its

famous "Sing, Sing, Sing," an unarranged-for piano solo by Jess Stacy was

slipped in near the end of the piece. It is one of the most remarkable jazz

piano solos ever played, and is certainly the best Stacy has ever put on

record.)<p>



<p>



Live jazz was recorded as early as 1935, but for some reason it was not

considered feasible to reproduce it on 78 rpms for public consumption. This

precedent was first broken in 1945 by Norman Granz, who, as one of jazz's

liveliest aficionados, originated in the early forties the notion of taking on

tour for concert appearances a select group of musicians--an arrangement he has

called "Jazz at the Philharmonic." In 1944, unbeknownst to the participating

musicians, he recorded sections of a concert he was producing in Los Angeles.

They were released soon afterwards in a 12-inch 78 rpm album of three records,

and there were just two tunes--"Lady Be Good" and "How High the Moon"--each of

which covered three sides, or approximately fifteen minutes of playing time.

His experiment has proved a huge success, for he has released fifteen albums

since then, the last an entire concert on three 12-inch LPs, amounting to about

two hours of music. Other record companies have now followed suit, using the

advantageous expanded playing time of the LP, and the record stores are stocked

with live performances of all varieties and qualities, ranging from night club

stints to private jam sessions.<p>



<p>



A brief mention of a few of these should give an idea of what is being done in

this area. In 1941, a jazz fan who happened to have a recording machine and

some acetate disks with him recorded two numbers--"Charlie's Choice" and

"Stompin' at the Savoy"--by the late inimitable guitarist Charlie Christian.

(These records, however, were not released for commercial consumption until the

late forties.) It was done in a small Harlem night club named Minton's, and

although the quality of the accompanying music was not high, Christian was

given generous solo space. Because the atmosphere was an intimate one--in which

he seemed to function best--the results are invaluable. Many

better-than-average jam sessions have been recorded, and four of the best have

been put out on four 10-inch LP's under the title of "jazz at Storyville"

(Storyville is a night club in the Copley Square Hotel in Boston), and feature

such musicians as Edmond Hall, Vic Dickenson, Pee Wee Russell, Dave Brubeck,

and Marian McPartland. One of the most recent and striking examples has been

issued on a l2-inch Columbia LP called "Harry James: One Night Stand." It was

recorded one night last year in New York by direct wire from Chicago where

James was playing at the Aragon Ballroom. The band, which was an excellent one,

sounds expansive and powerful, if somewhat strident in places. And the general

enthusiasm of the evening, in the musicians' responses both to one another and

to a warm audience, comes through in singular and persuasive fashion.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>R</font>ECORDING jazz music in a studio is a far different proposition. In 1917, the

Original Dixieland Jazz Band, out of New Orleans, was the first jazz outfit

ever to be recorded. There are rumors that the legendary New Orleans cornetist,

Buddy Bolden, who ceased playing in 1907, was also recorded; but, if so, the

records have vanished. Since 1917, countless 78 rpm jazz records have been cut

in studios; but there have always been the same hobbling factors involved, some

of which will never be surmounted. Perhaps the most important obstacle was the

three-to-five minute time limit of one side of the 78 rpm record. What was to

be played had to be tailored to fit three minutes. And if, as sometimes

happened, a group of musicians were functioning particularly well together and

did not feel like stopping when the engineer gave the signal, they either had

to stop, or were simply cut off. In addition, the garish atmosphere of most

recording studios is not sympathetic to the relaxed conditions that jazz

requires. And finally, a jazz musician, like any creative artist, never knows

what he will be capable of at any given time.<p>



<p>



The LP is the remedy for most of these ails, but strangely enough, the record

companies have been timid about using its greater time limits for studio

recording. Norman Granz has again, however, broken the proper ground. A little

while ago, he assembled in a studio ten of the best modern jazz a musicians

available (Charlie Shavers, Ben Webster, Charlie Parker, Benny Carter, Johnny

Hodges, Flip Phillips, Oscar Peterson, Barney Kessel, Ray Brown, and J. C.

Heard), and let them loose within the limits of two 12-inch LPs. Each side,

which runs to about sixteen or seventeen minutes of playing time, is devoted to

one number, except for one, which is a medley of tunes in solo form. The

results, although musically conventional, are very exciting on the whole. But

at the same time, these records show the inevitable pitfalls of the new long

recording: one feels, here and there, an unconscious lag, a feeling of slight

desperation on the musicians' part. Ten minutes have elapsed, and there are

still six or seven to go. The high spots, where inspiration has moved a man,

tighten things up, but they unravel fast when a fresh soloist, who may not have

felt in the swing of things that day comes along with a bagful of cliches.<p>



<p>



The adjustment, therefore, from the accustomed time limits of the 78 rpm to the

LP is going to be a considerable one for jazz musicians, arrangers, and

composers. And this adjustment involves the listener as well, for there was

something tidy, easy, and often sufficient about the three minute record; in

listening to some of the long recordings, I have frequently found my attention

wandering.<p>



<p>



Some musical experimentation has been done. A new Columbia l2-inch LP, called

"Ellington Uptown," presents the Duke's rejuvenated band playing three of his

standards in expanded form ("The Mooche," "Take the 'A' Train" and "Perdido"),

as well as a new arrangement featuring the sparkling drumming of Louis Bellson,

and a section from one of the Duke's new concert pieces, "Harlem Suite."

Unfortunately, this record struck me as a rehash, for only in "Perdido" do the

benefits of extra time come through in fresh and unpretentiously played solos

and section work. Elsewhere there are evidences of padding, staginess, and even

pompousness. The Duke, great as his stature is, must also think anew. The music

of Lennie Tristano, the exceptional blind pianist, is another possibility for

the longer recordings, for he has been working with Bachlike counterpoint, with

and without rhythm, and the fugue form. Another might be in Dixieland. Bob

Crosby's big band of the late thirties hinted at broader fields in their

12-inch 78 rpm "South Rampart Street Parade." Finally, there is now an

unequaled chance to get on record in expanded form some of jazz music's

greatest individual instrumentalists and singers. The irrepressible Granz has

done just that with four 12-inch LPs of the work of Oscar Peterson, the

pianist.<p>



<p>



There, briefly, is the encouraging and pleasant picture which LP has made

possible for live and studio-recorded jazz. As for the music itself, the newest

of jazz's many forms, bebop, although it has been pronounced dead, is still

very much alive. It has, to a large extent, simply been absorbed into the main

stream of jazz. Big bands that found their success in the late swing era around

1940, such as those of Count Basie and Harry James, have written bop figures,

bop harmonics, and bop rhythms into their arrangements. Their soloists will,

nine out of ten times, use bop phrasing; that is, the grouping and number of

notes in one idea or musical sentence will be larger and more numerous than

they were in the typical swing or Dixieland phrasing.<p>



<p>



Pure bebop, which can best be played by a small band, is still being practiced

in person and on records by some of the men--Bud Powell, Charlie Parker, Dizzy

Gillespie--who brought it to perfection in the mid-forties. A good many of the

younger apostles--with the exception of bright musicians like Dave Brubeck,

Gerry Mulligan, and George Wallington--have, however, exhausted themselves.

Their techniques were never equal to the music, which, with its longer melodic

lines, its atonality and weakened rhythms, can be exceedingly hard to execute,

let alone think out in that split second before delivery. As a result, they

imitated their elders apishly, and produced cliche after cliche.<p>



<p>



But if many of the younger men are burned out, some of the musicians who became

prominent during the days of swing have broadened their styles by absorbing the

leavening and loosening qualities of bop, which are its best features. The work

of Red Norvo, the great vibraphonist, is an outstanding example of this. Norvo

came to the fore in the late thirties with a fine small swing band of his own.

Since then, his style has moved with the music by becoming increasingly supple

and exciting in its use of more complicated harmonics and rhythms. He has

played with consummate ease in the company of the greatest of the bop

musicians, and has recently recorded, on a couple of 12-inch LPs, some

first-rate modern trio sides, using a guitar and a string bass. <p>



<p>



As I have mentioned, most of the surviving swing bands--Basie, Woody Herman,

Stan Kenton, Tommy Dorsey--have altered in varying degrees their arrangements

and have picked up young soloists whose playing has been influenced by bop.

Others have stuck to imitations of Glenn Miller or Claude Thornhill, or have

reverted to Dixielandish effects.<p>



<p>



Most of the Dixielanders have remained true and firm. There is a more

adventurous group, which has chosen to play a Dixieland minus a good deal of

its curbing chunkiness. They are using longer melodic lines, different

harmonies in ensembles sometimes partly arranged, and, most notable of all, a

rhythm section that swings along on a steady four beats to the bar, the old

two-beat having been discarded. Yank Lawson and Bob Haggart, who are both

eminent alumni of Bob Crosby's Dixieland band, are the gentlemen who have done

this on four 10-inch LPs-- "Jelly Roll's Jazz," King Oliver's Jazz," "Blues on

the River," and "Ragtime Jamboree" (the three minute limit has been religiously

adhered to for each number, though). They have assembled a group of men who are

primarily swing musicians, although one, the pianist, Lou Stein has definite

overtones of bop in his playing. What they have done must ultimately be judged

by private taste, of course. But, undeniably, their music sounds fresh,

bumptious, and free wheeling. It has given, a new look to an honorable, earlier

form of jazz, which a few years back seemed to be playing itself round and

round through the museums of recorded jazz. <p>



<p>



A word should be said here about the darkening moral climate of jazz today.

Jazz musicians have been accepted as respectable people only since their music

has become accepted. Perhaps this enforced social isolation, together with the

terrible hours, economic pressures, and the continual demands for fresh

creative invention, has been responsible for  a condition that has,

unfortunately, been growing steadily worse, especially with the younger

musicians. Heavy drinking has always been a problem, and now dope addiction has

become alarmingly widespread. One can only hope that as the music continues to

develop, its creators will develop an equivalent emotional and moral

stability.<p>



<p>



Live jazz is being played in limited quantities today, and much of the activity

in the jazz world is to be heard on records only. People do not seem willing,

with the high cost of living, to support night clubs and big ballrooms as they

did before and just after the Second World War. if this is so, the LP and the

tape recorder are inspiring things to have around.<p>

<blockquote>

	<font size=5>I</font>N the course of reporting for this magazine a number 
	of writers have put their lives on the line.  The circumstances have 
	sometimes been the stuff of high geopolitical drama: Robert D.  Kaplan's 
	forays into war-torn Eritrea (July, 1988) and Afghanistan (September, 1988) 
	come to mind.  Other occasions have had more of an op&eacute;ra-bouffe 
	quality.  Readers who missed James Fallows's account of his nauseating 
	flight at speeds nearing Mach 2 aboard an F-15 (Fallows was taken aloft by 
	an Air Force pilot after having criticized the F-15 in these pages) would 
	do well to look up <A HREF="Fallfly.htm">"I Fly With the Eagles,"</a> in
	 the November, 1981, 
	issue.<p>
	
	During the past decade and a half <i>Atlantic</i> authors have been shot 
	at, have exposed themselves to exotic pathogens, and have criticized 
	Camille Paglia.  Andrew Todhunter, the author of <A 
	HREF="../osman/osman.htm">"The 
	Precipitous World of Dan Osman,"</A> has the distinction of being the first 
	<i>Atlantic</i> contributor to jump off a cliff in pursuit of a story (or 
	at least the first one to turn the story in).  Todhunter, twenty-nine, has 
	previously written about sea kayaking during winter storms (August, 1995) 
	and scuba diving beneath the ice (January, 1994).  His article in this 
	issue is about one of the nation's most accomplished rock climbers, a man 
	who deliberately falls from great heights and who initiated the author into 
	the procedure.<p>
	
	"It's not about risk," Todhunter asserts.  "That's not why I do any of 
	these things.  An adrenaline hit is exquisite, but far more than 
	adrenaline--under the ice, in bad weather at sea, in the seconds following 
	a free fall--the core experience is closer to losing oneself in something 
	of great beauty."<p>
	
	Born in Paris, raised in New York, Colorado, and Washington, D.C., 
	Todhunter worked as a laborer and spent six months camping at 
	archaeological sites in Europe and Egypt before earning a degree in ancient 
	history at the University of California at Berkeley.  A writer and 
	outdoorsman, he has spent much of the past twenty years sailing, scuba 
	diving, skiing, surfing, kayaking, climbing, and caving.  He admits that 
	over the next decade, in addition to becoming "a passable fiddler, husband, 
	and cook," he would like to climb Denali, dive the wreck of the <i>Andrea 
	Doria</i>, and paddle a kayak from Lake Nasser to the Mediterranean.  <p>
	
	In the months ahead <i>The Atlantic</i> will no doubt be supporting some of 
	Todhunter's other outdoor endeavors.  The insurance he can take care of 
	himself.<p>

	<font size=5>"Y</font>ou want to fly with the eagles, you got to pay the price," Dick Anderegg told

me on the phone. Anderegg is an Air Force major in his middle thirties, a

fighter pilot so proficient that until recently he was an instructor at the Air

Force's Fighter Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base, near Las Vegas. Now he

works at the Pentagon, as an aide (or "action officer," in the current phrase)

to a general, and it was in that capacity that he became my chaperone for a

time early this fall.<p>



<p>



The Air Force is well-known for embracing its antagonists with hospitality and

with technical displays. I had become eligible for such embrace by writing (in

the May issue of The Atlantic) about the harmful consequences of the American

military's progression toward more complex, sensitive, and expensive

weaponry--of which one of the most complex, sensitive, and expensive specimens

is the fighter plane known as the "Eagle," or F-15. After the article was

published, the Air Force arranged several meetings with pilots and other

authorities who testified about the Eagle's capabilities. At the end of one

such session, I commented that if the plane was so phenomenal, it would

certainly be interesting to take a ride.<p>



<p>



"Done," said John T. Chain, the major general who was at the time the Air

Force's director of operations. He passed me into the hands of Major Anderegg,

with whom I spent many hours in the following weeks.<p>



<p>



The "price" that Anderegg had in mind was the sequence of pre-flight

examinations and training that outsiders must go through before they are

allowed to ride into the sky. One was an extensive physical, meant to reduce

the likelihood that a passenger will die during the flight. Next came

"physiological training," a three-hour session at Andrews Air Force Base

designed to inform those who will fly in high-performance aircraft about some

of the conditions they may confront. Half the time was devoted to a lecture

about what happens to the human body when it is subjected to low atmospheric

pressure and shortages of oxygen; the other half was spent in a test chamber

that simulated those two conditions. Air Force pilots are required to go

through physiological training every three years, and they regard it as a bore.

Quite a few outsiders have also taken it. "In my time here we've trained twice

on Saturdays," one officer told me during my visit, which took place on a

Wednesday. "Once for General Allen [Lew Allen, the Air Force Chief of Staff]

and once for John Denver."<p>



<p>



I spent my time in the chamber under the supervision of Sergeant Clark Mittan,

a twenty-four-year veteran of the force. He began by demonstrating the effects

of low pressure on the ears and on gases trapped in the nether regions of the

body. Inside the chamber, the atmospheric pressure was slowly reduced to

approximately that at an elevation of 35,000 feet. In the chamber was a quart

jar with a surgical glove stretched across its mouth. At sea-level pressure,

the glove hung limp. At 35,000 feet, it was the size of a basketball. My

abdomen felt as if it had a basketball inside. Then normal pressure was

restored, as a prelude to "explosive decompression"--a simulation of what would

happen if the airplane's canopy blew off during high-altitude flight.<p>



<p>



As the final item of physiological training, Sergeant Mittan demonstrated the

effects of hypoxia, or a shortage of oxygen. Captain Albert Hartzell, in the

lecture that preceded the "chamber flight," had listed some of the symptoms of

hypoxia--rapid breathing, impaired judgment, a blue tint to the fingertips and

lips. This demonstration was supposed to teach me how to make the diagnosis

myself. It was not hard. With the chamber's "altitude" raised to 25,000 feet,

the sergeant told me to take off my oxygen mask. He then handed me a little

worksheet and told me to begin. On the left were columns of numbers to add or

multiply, along with mazes and other items demanding reasoning power. On the

right was a list of the symptoms of hypoxia. The idea was to start working on

the problems, and then to circle the symptoms as they occurred. Within thirty

seconds, arithmetic was a challenge. One minute later, I was drawing loose

circles around "dizzy" and "sleepy" on the symptom list and was looking forward

to a long, long sleep. Sergeant Mittan reached over to snap my oxygen mask back

on. The lesson was at an end.<p>



<p>



"Have a good trip," the sergeant said. "How come WE never get to fly on those

planes?" the captain asked. I was prepared for everything except what actually

occurred.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>

My hope had been to enjoy a spectacle without creating one. The second part of

that hope was not to be fulfilled. At dinner the night before the flight, I sat

in the officers' club at Langley Air Force Base, in Virginia, with two generals

and assorted colonels and majors. I made nervous hardee-har-har jokes about

increasing my life-insurance coverage and enjoying my last meal. The delight on

my face was all too obvious whenever Thomas Barber, the lieutenant colonel and

squadron commander who would be my pilot the following morning, turned down the

waitress's repeated offers of wine or after-dinner drinks. The wake-up was set

for six o'clock the following morning. As the clock passed ten, I grew anxious

that Barber had not yet been sent home to get a good sleep. I was alarmed when,

shortly after eleven, one of the generals asked Barber not to go directly home

but instead to swing past the squadron headquarters and pick up a flight suit

for me to wear. It was almost midnight when we picked up the suit. In the

meantime, Major General John Piotrowski, who accompanied me during nearly every

waking hour of my visit, had taken me out to the flight line to watch the

late-shift maintenance crew work on the F-15s. Go to bed! I wanted to say when

I saw Barber there holding my flight suit and my black Air Force boots. He

stood by politely until the general finished his explanations, then we went our

separate ways to bed.<p>



<p>



When I reappeared in the officers' club at six-thirty the next morning for

breakfast with the general, I was a changed man. I was clothed in the flight

suit, a light-weight green overall that had badges and insignia on every

available space. These gave my name and indicated my association with the

Tactical Air Command, the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing, the 94th Tactical Fighter

Squadron--and my assignment, should the need arise, to the Rapid Deployment

Force. The 94th Squadron, which Tom Barber commanded, is Eddie Rickenbacker's

old unit, and its emblem is Rickenbacker's hat-in-the-ring from World War I.

Members of the squadron wear white mock-silk scarves, printed with pale blue

hats-in-the-ring. "Wear the scarf," General Piotrowski had told me as he

dropped me at my quarters the night before. "The men have a lot of pride in the

unit. It'll mean something to them." I had put it on under the flight suit and

fluffed it out at the neck in the fashion of an ascot. When I entered the

squadron headquarters after breakfast, I saw that my scarf did mean something

to the pilots, and what it meant was, This man is a jerk. They wore their

scarves draped around their necks, like shawls, with only the thinnest edge

visible above the flight suit. I scuttled into the bathroom and re-emerged

looking--at least as far as my scarf was concerned--just like everybody else.<p>



<p>



Under the guidance of Gerald Gomez, a sergeant in his mid-twenties who had a

no-nonsense air, the 94th's equipment crew began suiting me up. I received an

oxygen mask, after the length and breadth of my face was measured with

calipers; a helmet, complete with visor and moleskin skullcap to absorb the

sweat; a parachute harness, which when it is fully connected requires the

wearer to walk bent over, like a gorilla; and finally, my G-suit.<p>



<p>



The G-suit is an abbreviated set of coveralls that runs from the bottom of the

rib cage down to the ankles and that contains several inflatable bladders. The

bladders lie over the lower abdomen, the thighs, and the calves of the legs. To

make sure the bladders are snug, two of the crewmen stand behind the wearer and

haul on laces with all their might, as if they were helping Scarlett O'Hara

into her whalebone corset. When fighter airplanes go into violent maneuvers,

their crews are subjected for periods of seconds or even minutes to forces

several times as great as that of gravity. (Three Gs equals three times the

force of gravity, for example.) The effect of high Gs is, among other things,

to drive the pilot's blood away from his brain and toward his abdomen and legs,

causing him to pass out. The idea of the G-suit is to slow this process down.

Inside the plane, the suit is connected to a pneumatic system that

automatically inflates the bladders as soon as high-G forces begin. The

pressure the bladders exert on the legs and belly is supposed to retard the

pooling of blood--and also to remind the wearer to begin the "M-1 maneuver,"

which involves tensing the muscles of the entire body and making deep grunting

sounds. "The G-suit and the M-1, they'll give you an extra G or two of

protection," one sergeant said, while lacing me up. "Here's what it's going to

feel like." He walked me over to a bicycle pump and inflated the suit. As the

bladders swelled around me, I felt like the Michelin tire man.<p>



<p>



My education as a flier included one more step, known as "emergency egress

training." Like other non-flying chores, such as sitting at the end of the

runway to make sure that planes aren't about to land with their wheels still

up, this duty is rotated among the pilots in the squadron. The 94th's emergency

egress officer was Ed Cantwell, a twenty-four-year-old lieutenant who, like so

many other officers, had grown up in a military family. He had gone into the

Air Force after graduating from Duke. As a class, fighter pilots tend toward a

jauntiness that tempts some of them to look down on even the test pilots, whose

world Tom Wolfe glorified in The Right Stuff. No one is shooting at the test

pilots, after all. This confidence is most obvious among young pilots, such as

Cantwell. At an age when his classmates were swotting for the bar exam or

making insurance deals, Cantwell was flying the hottest plane. I pitched him a

softball: "I guess it's pretty much the top of the heap to be driving the

F-15." "You bet," he said with a grin.<p>



<p>



Cantwell drove me to a training hangar that contained a mock-up of the F-15's

cockpit. He showed me how to get into the seat, how to undo all the buckles and

harnesses if I had to get out of the plane in a hurry on the ground, and which

handles I should not touch unless I wanted to blow the canopy off or eject

myself while the plane was still on the runway. "We had a nurse do that one

time," he said. "DON'T TOUCH 'EM." He said that if we had to eject from the

plane at high altitude, my only job would be to lean back and let the automatic

systems do their work. A substantial investment of faith would be required if

that occurred. When the plane is flying at 35,000 feet, the temperature outside

is 65 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and there is virtually nothing to breathe.

If a flier has to eject at that height, he is supposed not to deploy his

parachute, which would slow him down so much that he would spend too much time

in these inhospitable surroundings, but instead simply to drop like a stone

until he reaches an altitude of some 14,000 feet. This means a total free fall

of about four miles, which takes almost three minutes. A small drogue parachute

is supposed to open along the way and provide just enough drag to keep the

chair upright rather than letting it tumble end over end. In theory, there is

nothing to worry about throughout that long descent, and no reason to rip in

panic at the manual parachute release, because special sensors in the new Aces

II ejection seat are supposed to send out the parachute at just the right time.

I thought that pilots must be a trusting lot.<p>



<p>



What remained was the pre-flight briefing, conducted by another pilot, Captain

Donald Ross. Ross could have been a figure from a movie about the RAF during

the Battle of Britain. Lean and dark-haired, he is in his late twenties, and

wears a thin moustache. Ross had recently been selected to join a class at the

Fighter Weapons School at Nellis. He would fly one F-15 while I rode behind

Barber in the other. Together they would engage two F-4 fighters, which would

assume the role of Russian fighter-bomber planes known as "Floggers." For this

exercise, the Floggers would be thought of as heading for a target area--a NATO

airfield, say--which they would destroy if they managed to reach it unmolested.

The role of the F-15s was to "kill" them before they got there.<p>



<p>



Ross went to a blackboard and indicated with his pointer the area of the

exercise, a circle roughly thirty miles in diameter over the Atlantic Ocean.

The Floggers would take off from North Carolina, and the F-15s would go and get

them. The obvious purpose of the exercise was to show off the virtues of the

F-15's electronics and radar systems, which can detect other planes at great

distances and send a variety of radar-guided missiles to destroy them. In real

combat, it might be difficult to tell which of the blips on the radar screen

was friendly and which a foe--indeed, this is one of the central criticisms of

the plane's high-cost radar systems. No such difficulties would affect this

demonstration: since the exercise was to be run in a special restricted air

zone, anything that showed up would be the enemy.<p>



<p>



In the first two simulated attacks, the F-15s would rely on their radar

missiles. In the third, Ross and Barber would start out using radar but then

convert to a "visual" approach--that is; they would wait to see the other

planes before shooting at them. In place of real missiles, the planes in the

exercise would carry "pods" full of sensors that would record minute details of

each plane's movements and its position relative to all the others.<p>



<p>



These readings could then be combined in a computer and stored on tape. After

the flight, we would see all the action replayed on a four-foot-square,

full-color computer screen, which would offer views of each engagement as it

appeared from above (the "God's-eye view"), from the side, or from the cockpit

of each airplane.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



At last it was time to march out to the planes. The F-15, though large by the

standards of fighter aircraft, looks small to laymen accustomed to commercial

planes. It has a double tail, a large "bubble" canopy, and rectangular air

intakes roughly four feet by two feet on either side of the cockpit.<p>



<p>



"You'll see how roomy she is," Ed Cantwell told me as I jackknifed my way into

the rear seat. (The F-15 usually flies with only one pilot, but one or two

planes in each squadron of twenty-four planes are modified to include a second

seat.)<p>



<p>



Tom Barber, who had been taciturnity itself before stepping into the airplane,

suddenly came to life, radioing commands and going through his pre-flight

checklists, telling me to get my knees out of the way as he moved the joy stick

in his cockpit making the one in the rear seat move in sync. Cantwell told me

to take off my scarf, already the source of so much annoyance, because it would

constitute a fire hazard during flight. As I tucked it into a pocket on one leg

of my G-suit, I saw that Barber had already removed his scarf. I had not

realized until then that the scarves were purely for esprit de corps, and could

not be worn when the pilots were doing their job. Soon everything was buttoned

up--helmet fastened with chin strap, oxygen mask clipped onto helmet, canopy

cover lowered onto the plane. As Ed Cantwell had suggested, I pushed the button

that raised my seat until I could survey the surroundings from high up in the

canopy. Barber told me to lower the tinted visor on the helmet, and we were

off.<p>



<p>



The two F-15s--code-named "SPAD 1" and "SPAD 2" (after the French planes that

Rickenbacker flew) for this exercise--taxied to the end of the runway and lined

up side by side. They started rolling down the runway together and lifted off

in perfect parallel. "What's the separation here?" I asked Barber, as I looked

to my left and saw Ross's plane almost close enough to touch. "Ahh...ten feet

at the wingtips," he said. For about a minute, the planes climbed together at a

steep angle, constantly gaining speed.<p>



<p>



"Piece of cake," I thought, as we traveled out over the ocean and the planes

moved farther apart. The airspeed was about 550 miles per hour, but so far all

the acceleration had been straight ahead, producing a sensation that was much

stronger than but otherwise no different from what the passengers feel when a

car in which they are riding speeds off from a standing start. The large, clear

canopies gave the effect not of looking at the atmosphere but of being out in

it. Everything was quiet and smooth.<p>



<p>



I watched as Barber adjusted the radar scan to cover different altitudes and

distances and to look for the blips that would be the "enemy" planes. Once the

blips appeared, the ensuing steps would be like those of "Space Invaders" or

other computerized video games. Barber would position a targeting marker over

the blip he wanted to destroy. A set of indicators on the right-hand side of

the radar screen would tell him when the target was within firing range. When

everything was lined up, he would push the firing button. In real combat, a

radar-guided missile would be released; in this case, a computerized command

center that was monitoring the exercise would get the indication that Barber

had fired. The missile would presumably track down the target. The enemy blip

would disappear from the screen.<p>



<p>



As Barber finished explaining the procedure, the radio crackled. Ross, in SPAD

1, had seen the Floggers in the area he was watching. The engagements began.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Of the next fifty-five minutes I have only the most confused and distressing of

memories. When the exercise was over and I could watch it all replayed on the

computer screen, I could discern the logical pattern of events. The F-15s

turned to intercept the Floggers; the Floggers turned in response; the F-15s

got within range and fired their (simulated) missiles. All went as planned.

Even the last engagement, the dogfight in which the F-15s chased down the

Floggers to very close range, seemed clear and comprehensible on the screen.

But in the air, it looked much different.<p>



<p>



During our drive from Washington to Langley Air Force Base, Dick Anderegg, the

combat pilot, had said, "I think you'll be surprised at what sheer physical

labor it is to fly in these planes." Surprise was hardly the term. Nothing in

normal life approximates either the effect of the high G-forces or the

disorientation caused by the repeated, sudden changes in course. The highest

G-forces occur when the plane makes a sharp turn, and the longer the turn is

sustained, the longer the pilot must "pull" extra Gs. The effect is the same as

when children fill a pail of water, attach a rope to the handle, and then swing

it around with the rope. As the pail moves in a circle, the constant

acceleration creates the centrifugal force that holds the water in the bottom

of the pail. As the airplane moves through a curve, the acceleration creates

the high G-forces that drive the pilot toward the bottom of his chair. G-forces

are technically described as making your body feel as if it weighs several

times more than its normal weight. To me, it felt as if I were being held in a

giant fist and squeezed. At 5 Gs, my head was driven down onto my chest. For

days after the flight, the muscles at the back of my neck ached from their

futile attempt to resist that pressure. At 6 Gs, the flesh over my cheekbones

was pulled down toward my chin. The G-meter showed that the maximum force

during the flight was about 7 Gs, which we held for just a few seconds. Barber

said that the F-15 can sustain a 4- or 5-G turn until it runs out of gas, and

that pilots may have to "pull" those G-forces for as long as a minute. ("It

feels like all day.") Pilots who fly the F-16 must withstand forces as high as

9 Gs. All the while, of course, they are guiding the airplane, selecting

targets, and trying to avoid being destroyed by enemy planes.<p>



<p>



More discomforting than the sustained G-forces was the accumulation of sudden

turns. After the flight, in an attempt to lift my spirits, some of the pilots

told me that even they grew queasy when forced to ride in the rear seat, where

they are not in control of the plane's movements and are therefore caught by

surprise by each turn.<p>



<p>



That may be true; all I know for certain is that, having started the flight in

robust good health, I was reduced after twenty minutes of maneuvering to a

state of paralyzing nausea.<p>



<p>



There was, in fact, some warning of the turns. Over the radio, I would hear

Barber tell Ross, "90 left," which meant that the planes would make sharp

right-angle turns to the left. More simply, they said, "Goin' at 'em," which

meant a screaming dive toward the Floggers. By the time I'd had enough

experience to know what a 90-degree turn would be like, I was able to join in

the chatter between the planes:<p>



<p>



"90 left, SPAD 1."<p>



<p>



"Roger, 90 left, SPAD 2."<p>



<p>



"God, no!"<p>



<p>



From the physiologist's perspective, it was a case of the fluid inside the

three semicircular canals of the inner ear being set in too-rapid motion and

producing the sensation of nausea. From my perspective, it was an acute

practical problem. Before I left the squadron building, a young sergeant had

laid down the law "You puke in your mask, you clean it out." As the plane

leveled off between passes, I clawed at the bayonet clamp that held the mask to

the helmet, determined at all costs to get the mask away from my face. In a

pouch near the bottom of my G-suit, Dick Anderegg had thoughtfully tucked away

four plastic bags for just such a contingency. I got one out and placed it to

my face just in time--and then, in a fool's paradise, imagined that because

there was nothing more in my stomach, I'd be safe for the rest of the flight.

The truth was less pleasant. For the last twenty minutes of the flight, I

worked a carefully coordinated two-handed maneuver. In the left hand, I held my

oxygen mask, which I slapped to my face for occasional breaths. (The cabin's

internal pressure was such that I didn't really need the mask, but the oxygen

was cool and felt good.) In my right hand was the bag, which alternated places

with the mask, in a retch-breathe-retch-breathe pattern.<p>



<p>



As I was getting the pattern down, Barber's voice came through the intercom:<p>



<p>



"How ya doing?" .<p>



<p>



"Okay," I said in a strangled voice.<p>



<p>



"Want to see what she can do?"<p>



<p>



"Sssssuuuuuure." I had come this far, and (I had recently decided) I would

never be here again, so why not see the whole show?<p>



<p>



Up we went.<p>



<p>



The F-15 weighs some 40,000 pounds. Its two engines can generate a thrust of

about 22,500 pounds each, for a total of 45,000 pounds. The result is a

"thrust-to-weight" ratio of greater than 1, which means that the plane, unlike

most in the world, can not only travel virtually straight up but can, under

certain circumstances, gain speed while doing so. Barber showed me some of

these "vertical maneuvers." We climbed in what seemed like seconds from 15,000

to 38,000 feet--an ascent of more than four miles. We went back down, then

began a nearly straight-up climb, at the top of which he leaned the airplane

over onto its back, and then came around for a nearly straight-down descent.

Outside the canopy the sky and sea twirled around and around.<p>



<p>



Some of these acrobatics were quite exhilarating, as opposed to the wrenching,

zigzag turns of the rest of the flight.<p>



<p>



Either just before or just after the vertical maneuvers--all recollections are

blurred--it was time for the third engagement, the one in which the F-15s were

supposed to hunt down the Floggers and shoot them at close range. This involved

the hardest (i.e. the most sickening) maneuvering of all the engagements, and

it demonstrated yet another of the physical demands placed upon the pilots. The

F-4s that were acting as Floggers are supposed to be particularly ill-suited to

daytime air combat, since their engines emit smoke trails that make the planes

visible from miles away. Experienced F-4 pilots complain that the smoky engine

makes them forfeit the all-important ability to catch other planes by surprise.

The difference between smoking and smokeless engines is crucial to the pilots

but virtually undetectable by the untrained eye. By normal standards, my

eyesight is fine.<p>



<p>



But when I heard Ross and Barber saying, "There's the smoke trail," "Yep, I've

got him," and then looked outside, I could see nothing but sky. Barber kept

asking me, "See him? See him?" I said I couldn't, so he drove on the F-4 until

from his perspective he was about to fly up the other plane's tailpipe. At that

point, I could make out a small craft nearby, barely distinguishable against

the background of blue.<p>



<p>



With the Floggers thrice destroyed, and the vertical maneuvers out of the way,

SPAD 1 and SPAD 2 turned for home. Barber offered me my moment of glory,

asking, "You want to take the stick?" He soon inquired politely whether I could

see the horizon, since I kept pushing the plane into a leftward dive. I felt

fortunate that he could not turn around and see me behind him, so he did not

understand that the bias in my steering was caused by my wracked, slumping

posture in the back of the plane.<p>



<p>



"She's all yours," I said, as I reached for the bag again; he brought us in the

rest of the way.<p>



<p>



As the planes neared Langley, they lined up once again in parallel, a distance

that seemed to be inches but was actually a few feet separating their wings. At

such close range, I could see with perfect clarity every move that Don Ross

made as he sat, erect and jaunty, in the cockpit of his plane. I considered the

scene that presented itself to him when he turned to glance at us: one figure

in the front seat, calmly guiding the aircraft toward the runway, and in the

rear a limp rag doll, sweat pouring down his face, trying to preserve his

dignity by reconnecting his oxygen mask as his head bobbled weakly up and

down.<p>



<p>



Before the flight, an Air Force photographer had taken countless pictures of

the smiling visitor as he walked across the tarmac and climbed into the plane.

Those were printed and ready by the time we landed, including one mounted on a

plaque commemorating my new status as an "Eagle Driver." General Piotrowski

pressed these "before" pictures--and their negatives--into my hands after I

stumbled down the ladder from the cockpit. I noticed the same photographer

nearby, snapping "after" pictures of a man with blotches of sweat all over his

flight suit and a yearning-for-death expression on his face. Those photos, and

their negatives, remain in the Air Force's merciful hands.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



I did not go to Langley just to have fun. There was an instructional purpose to

the visit, which was to hear the Air Force's rebuttal to criticisms of the

excessive cost, sensitivity, and complexity of its most "advanced" planes.<p>



<p>



To the Air Force, the F-15 is a symbol of the advances in computer systems,

radar, and propulsion that are necessary to repel the Soviet force. But to

those who argue against excessive complexity and cost, it represents

high-technology weapons that are more impressive in theory than they would be

in the chaotic conditions of real combat. This analysis concludes that it is

time to tip the balance back toward larger numbers of simpler, cheaper weapons

that are easier to maintain and that offer more training time for the troops.

The A-10, which is designed to destroy tanks, is one example of such an

airplane; a fighter called the F-16 is another.<p>



<p>



I heard the reasoning behind the Air Force's outlook during several long

sessions at Langley. One was a formal briefing that consumed much of the day

before my flight, in which two young officers stood behind lecterns and took

turns reading from a script and narrating slides and filmstrips, while I sat at

a big table with two generals and a half-dozen Colonels. Another was an

interview with William Creech, a four-star general who is commander of the

Tactical Air Command. This took place shortly after my experience in the sky.<p>



<p>



In defending the performance of their most complex weapons, the officials made

several reasonable points. They remarked that the reliability records of

complex planes such as the F-15 are starting to improve. Two and a half years

ago, about 44 percent of the F-15 fleet was classified as "not mission

capable"; now the rate is about 40 percent. This is a modest change, but it is

in the right direction. Similarly, the F-15s have shown a slight increase in

their "sortie per day" rate. (Simpler planes, such as the A-10 and the F-16,

have also improved in reliability, and they are still ahead of the F-15.) The

biggest reason for the improvement, according to General Creech, is that the

Air Force now has more spare parts on hand. He and other officials said that

they would not repeat the mistake of shortchanging the spare-parts account. In

saying so they concede a central argument made by one of their main critics, a

civilian official in the Pentagon named Chuck Spinney, who contends that the

military has chronically underestimated the amount of money it needs to operate

and maintain its ever more complex weapons.<p>



<p>



General Creech and others also pointed out that when they agree to sacrifice

quality for quantity, in order to enlarge the force, the Congress often forgets

the "quantity" part of the bargain when the time comes to buy more planes. For

example, the Air Force reluctantly accepted the F-16 (instead of extra F-15s)

on the assumption that it would be able to add seven new "wings" (of

seventy-two planes each) of these less-expensive fighter planes.

"Unfortunately, only one of those wings has materialized," Creech said. "This

makes me skeptical of the cheaper-and-more-numerous solution."<p>



<p>



The Air Force officials made several other arguments, though, that struck me as

weak and disingenuous. The officials at Langley implied that anyone who

criticized the Eagle harbored a secret desire to return to the P-51 and the

Spitfire, if not to the Piper Cub. The formal briefing contained several

straw-man formulations, such as "Some critics would suggest that we return to

the simple aircraft of the past"--followed by a slide detailing the mediocre

performance of various planes used in World War II. It is as if American auto

manufacturers had contended that the only alternative to the large, heavy

domestic cars of the mid-1970s was the Edsel or the Model T.<p>



<p>



Beyond these debating points, of course, lie certain perceptions of the world.

After the briefings, I thought that three premises could explain why the Air

Force's outlook is so different from that of its critics.<p>



<p>



The first concerns "the threat"--the nature of the adversary's force. Generals

Chain and Creech both stressed that the reformers pay too much attention to

American forces and too little to those of the Soviet Union. According to the

Air Force's presentation, the Russians are producing roughly 1,350 fighters and

bombers every year, or ten times as many as our annual additions to the F-15

and F-16 force. "And those are superb, highly sophisticated aircraft," one of

the generals said.<p>



<p>



In specific, the Air Force emphasizes the threat in Central Europe. All but a

handful of the charts and slides that accompanied the briefing illustrated the

theoretical array of forces in a sustained battle that might rage through

Germany. They showed how many tanks and aircraft the Russians could use to

mount an invasion, and how few resources we would have to stop them. The

briefing officers said that the Russians have developed forces capable of

rolling around the clock and in bad weather; therefore, we must have airplanes

that, like the F-15, can carry the fight to the enemy even if it is raining or

dark. The weak spot of a Soviet assault would be the "second echelon" of supply

trucks and camps that lie behind the advancing tanks; to exploit this weakness,

we need planes that, like the F-15, can penetrate the defenses. The Russian Air

Force is trained not for dogfights but for quick, low-altitude approaches to a

target area and equally rapid departures; therefore, we need not bother with

dog-fighters such as the F-16 but instead should concentrate on planes like the

F-15, which can use its long-range radar missiles to "fight outnumbered and

win." Several other assumptions about the threat are so deeply embedded that

they are rarely stated; that a Russian invasion of Western Europe is a

plausible danger; that plans for a prolonged European battle should determine

the basic structure of our forces; that land and air battles might rage in

Europe without forcing the Americans or the Russians or even the French to

resort to nuclear weapons. If you conclude, as the Air Force does, that these

are reasonable assumptions, their attempt to concentrate more of their

resources on the F-15 makes sense.<p>



<p>



The second premise concerns the perfectability of human contrivances--whether

things will work as planned. The Air Force's plans take for granted the

performance of many new machines. The F-15's system for shooting down planes as

soon as they show up on the radar assumes that there will be a way to tell

whether the blip is a Russian or an American (or a Belgian or a Polish) plane.

The data links that will connect the AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control

System) radar planes with the fighters and the ground bases will work only so

long as they are immune to enemy jamming. Radar-guided missiles will be worth

their great cost only if they can be depended upon to find their targets.<p>



<p>



In all of these areas, the Air Force officials said that the hardest technical

problems have been solved. They said that with the radar in an AWACS, they

could watch a Russian plane from the moment it left the runway and could

therefore tell the F-15 exactly which blip it should shoot down. They said that

a variety of communication systems, with names such as "Have Quick" and "Wild

Weasel," would ensure that our messages would go through unhindered, while we

could count on destroying the coherence of the rigidly centralized Soviet force

by jamming their communication lines. They said that although radar-guided

missiles performed quite poorly in Vietnam, the new generation would be more

effective. "We had our problems with the early missiles," General Creech said,

"but then there are problems with early anything." If the assumptions are

right, the policies make sense. If they are wrong, the policies may prove to be

disastrous.<p>



<p>



The third premise concerns economic realities. Those who worry about complex

weapons assume a world of tight economic limits. Each weapon that is built

means that another weapon can't be--to say nothing at all of the nation's

nonmilitary needs. Each increase in a weapon's complexity requires more

training for maintenance men and a larger supply of spare parts. These

constraints exist not because there is some abstract limit to the amount the

nation "should" invest in the military but rather because, in any conceivable

peacetime American society, there is a limit to how much it WILL spend. It is

one thing to argue, as many military men do, that the nation should be devoting

more of its resources to defense. It is something different, and very

dangerous, to base plans on the assumption that more money will in fact be

there to spend. Air Force planners allude to economic constraints, but their

first instinct is to ask for what they think we need, regardless of cost. It is

proper that they do so. It is also proper that the rest of us understand the

many other dimensions of the choice.<p>



<p>



At the end of the day, I had learned very little about the F-15 that I had not

known before. My experience with fighter airplanes was limited to this one

trip. I knew what it was like to ride in the back seat of an Eagle, but I could

not say with any confidence how different the maneuvers would have been in a

Tomcat, a Foxbat, or, for that matter, a B-52.<p>



<p>



But I did feel that I had learned something about the human beings who fly the

planes. For months I had heard pilots and aircraft designers emphasize that,

even in this most technically sophisticated of the military services, the

machines themselves are often less important than the spirit, skill, and

training of the people who fly and maintain the planes. Having seen the

thousand opportunities for disaster that a sloppy maintenance crew might

create, having glimpsed the physical and mental stress that pilots must endure,

I understood more fully what I had been told. The Air Force may have failed, in

my case, in its attempt to inspire greater loyalty to its machines, but that

effort was misguided. Our loyalty should go to the men who fly them.

<blockquote>





	<font size=5>A</font>T dawn on his thirty-second birthday the rock

climber Dan Osman	is poised to break the world record, his own, for a

free fall from a standing structure. Using nothing more than the modified

equipment of his trade, including single climbing ropes, a full-body harness,

and a reinforced anchor, he will jump approximately 660 feet from a bridge in

northern California.<p>

During a safety meeting in the hours before departure for the bridge, tasks are

assigned to the members of Osman's support team--in this case fellow climbers

Geoff Maliska, twenty-three, and Anthony Meeks, twenty. Precise details of the

protocol and rigging are reviewed. Upon arrival at the site the three move out

across the girders of the bridge, beneath the traffic, 700 feet above the

valley floor. Osman rigs the elaborate anchor--a nest of nylon loops, or

runners, climbing rope, and aluminum hardware--to a girder near the middle of

the bridge. Leaving Meeks to watch the anchor, Osman continues with Maliska

another 160 feet across the span.<p>

	</A>

	

When he nears the launching point, the rope hanging slack beneath the bridge in

a huge arc, Osman ties in, securing the rope to his harness. Because the fall

will originate at a great lateral distance from the anchor, when Osman reaches

rope's end much of the inertia will be diverted into a rocketing swing 500 feet

across the valley floor. As opposed to falling directly from the anchor

position, this approach keeps the initial impact--a striking whip when the rope

runs out of slack--within reasonable limits. <p>

The greatest danger in a fall of such a distance, Osman believes, is not a

failure of the system, which is sound, but entanglement. The force of impact

achieved at terminal velocity, he suspects, could bisect or decapitate a body

wound in the 10.5-millimeter rope. To practice extricating himself from such an

entanglement should it ever accidentally occur, Osman will intentionally wrap

himself in the rope during his fall. Then he will uncoil and assume the correct

position before impact. He will have seven seconds to do both. <p>

Osman checks his harness and knots three times and examines his clothing for

anything that might affect his fall. He looks down the rope and signals Meeks.

Meeks checks the anchor and returns the signal: all clear. <p>

Osman looks out across the valley. It is dawn. Passing cars drum intermittently

overhead. There are fishermen in the river far below. He watches the movement

of their rods. Their faint voices rise. <p>

He closes his eyes and visualizes the entire sequence of his fall, dilating the

seven seconds into eleven or twelve. He will execute three cartwheels. In the

middle of the third he will twist his body one full turn in the rope. He will

then disentangle himself--calmly, methodically, he will not thrash, he will not

thrash--and extend his limbs, relaxing as he enters the point of impact. It is

only when he completes the visualization that he fully comprehends the risk in

what he is about to attempt. Goose bumps swarm across his skin.<p>

Osman steps through what he calls the moment of choice. From fifteen he counts

down silently, saying only the ten and the five aloud. Four, three, two, one.

And then he falls.<p><pre>



</pre>

<font size=5>T</font>O climb at the edge of your ability is to fall, and climbing equipment is

designed to keep those falls from causing injury or death. But on occasion the

equipment fails, and the climber fails more often than that. On rope or off, it

is the fear of an unchecked fall--a bone-snapping, skull-crushing fall--that

nags most climbers, holds them back, thwarts their inspiration. <p>

In 1989, while attempting a new route on a difficult overhanging face, Osman

fell. Again and again, protected by the rope, he fell. He decided then that it

would be not in climbing but in falling that he would embrace his fear--bathe

in it, as he says, and move beyond it. He began to fall on purpose, from

greater and greater heights. Osman's comfort and performance on the rock have

improved accordingly. <p>

As a boy, I spent many unwise hours climbing with friends on Hook Mountain, in

Rockland County, New York. The Hook is a geological appendage of the Palisades,

which run like a curtain along the western bank of the Hudson River north of

the George Washington Bridge. We climbed with little more in the way of

equipment than canvas basketball shoes, cutoffs, and Yankees caps, and the

degenerate rock came out in fistfuls as we ascended.<p>

We continued north on bikes along the river, past Haverstraw to the Bear

Mountain Bridge. We skidded down the steep embankment from the road to walk

across the girders underneath the bridge. We trotted and then jogged back and

forth across the gray-green rivet-studded beams, each one twelve or fifteen

inches wide, leaning into gusts of wind to keep our balance several hundred

feet above the rocks along the river's eastern shore.<p>

In the dozen or so years that intervene I have dabbled in the media of ice and

rock. I have crossed glaciers in the North Cascades, climbed in the Rockies and

Shawangunks, bouldered in Fontainebleau and Joshua Tree. But by Osman's

standards I know the vertical world only vaguely. Beside the likes of him I am

not even a climber. In the cheerfully unminced words of Geoff Maliska, I am a

flatlander. I came to Lake Tahoe to meet Dan Osman, to watch him climb and

fall, and finally, with his guidance, to take an introductory 

plunge.<p><pre>



</pre>

<font size=5>A</font> ROPE lies loosely gathered at the	base of a decomposing granite

outcropping south of <A HREF="http://www.tahoe.com/Visitors.guide/Rec/Activities/Tahoe.climbing.areas.html">Lake Tahoe</A> known as The Pie Shop. Unwinding from its

center, the rope follows the ravine between two stones, rises through the

shivering branches of a manzanita bush, and moves up the granite face. The

rope, 8.8 millimeters in diameter, is diamondbacked in fluorescent orange,

yellow, and green. In the windless silence the friction of its passage across

the stone produces an amplified hiss that ebbs and swells in rhythm with the

progress of the climber above.<p>

Despite the rope attached to his harness, Osman is free-soloing the 165-foot

climb. That is to say, he is climbing unprotected by the rope, and any fall

will send him to the earth. He is merely carrying the rope to the top of the

outcropping for a later, more difficult climb. The route he follows is called

Earn Your Wings.<p>

Osman is lithe and under six feet tall. His dark hair, long enough to cover his

shoulder blades, is bound in a ponytail. In the 1890s Osman's paternal

great-grandfather, a descendant of samurai families in the Takeuchi clan,

emigrated to Hawaii from the mountainous Iwakuni region of Japan. Takeuchi was

shot and killed in 1919 on a sugar plantation while attempting to disarm a

fellow laborer who was preparing to assassinate their foreman. As a boy, Osman

was trained in the samurai ethic of bushido by his father, Les Osman, a veteran

police officer. The young Osman studied aikido and, later, kung fu.<p>

Climbers speak often of elegance--elegance of climbing style, elegance of

route. And it is undeniable that climbing without rope is more elegant than

climbing roped, just as climbing roped but mechanically unaided is more elegant

than gadgeting skyward with ascenders and rope ladders, called &eacute;triers.

The catch of free-soloing, and its appeal, is the simplicity of its demand: one

cannot fall. Like the kendo practitioner who lays aside his wooden sword to

duel in earnest with live blades, the free-soloist--in freeing himself or

herself from the rope on routes where falling is tantamount to death--becomes a

kind of mystic.<p>

In preparation for a particularly difficult solo Osman will climb the route

several times on rope, repeating the crux, or most difficult move, until he is

certain he can execute the climb without error. "Then I start breathing," he

explains, "to get the <i>ki</i> down into my <i>hara</i>."<p>

Loosely translated from the Japanese as "vital energy," <i>ki</i> is to the

martial artist as harmony is to the musician. The <i>hara </i>(literally,

"belly"), a point in the abdomen below the navel, is held to be the center and

source of physical energy--a reservoir of sorts in which <i>ki</i>, largely

through breath control, may be pooled and from which it may be directed.<p>

"I visualize a screen," Osman continues, "a steel filter that I lower with my

breaths to keep the positive energy and let the negative energy escape. All the

fear I allow to escape." When he is centered--a process that takes from five to

twenty minutes--he is ready to climb. "I feel the air pressure," he says. "The

<i>ki</i> is very concentrated, very strong. I feel the gravity more. When I

step onto the rock, my senses immediately sharpen. The taste in my mouth

becomes vivid."<p>

Although Earn Your Wings is no challenge for a climber of his ability, Osman

appears to spare nothing. His pace is unhurried. The expression on his face is

a void. Even on large, secure holds, the placements of his hands and feet--the

latter tightly shod in pale-blue red-laced black-soled rock shoes--are

unerringly precise. Without interrupting the liquid flow of his movement he

seems to consider each hold as if preparing to catch the raised head of an asp.

When he makes his placement, it is final. There is no shuffle, no grope. For

all his fluidity there is an awesome mechanical beat to his progress. Bang.

Bang. Bang. Bang. He seems to climb within a field generated by the

concentration of his will.<p>

Climbs are rated according to a numeric class system devised by Sierra Club

mountaineers in the 1930s. From Class 1, walking, and Class 2, scrambling, the

rating mounts to difficult free climbing (mechanically protected--unless

soloing--but unaided) at Class 5, and concludes with aid climbing (mechanically

assisted in resting and ascent) at Class 6. Class 5 is subdivided with a second

set of numbers, which is further nuanced by pluses or minuses (5.8+) or even

more precisely, on climbs of 5.10 and above, with the letters <i>a</i> through

<i>d</i>. The difference between a 5.12d and a 5.13a is often subtle and

sometimes a matter of debate. The difference indicated by a full numerical

subdivision, however, is substantial; dedicated climbers can spend months or

even years advancing from 5.10 to 5.11, from 5.11 to 5.12. Earn Your Wings is a

5.9. Arguably the most difficult free climb in the world as of this

writing--infamous for its dynamic one-finger moves--is Action Directe, 5.14d,

in Germany, which was established, or "placed," by the late Wolfgang

G&uuml;llich. G&uuml;llich, a legendary climber, died in an accident on the

autobahn in 1992 at the age of thirty-one. <p>

With the encouragement of his mother, Sharon Burks, a horse trainer and

two-time world-champion barrel racer (the barrel race is a rodeo event

involving agile horses, standing barrels, and figure eights), Osman began

climbing at age twelve. Despite his evident talent, he describes himself as a

slow developer, having taken eight years to break through to 5.12.<p>

Osman completes Earn Your Wings and proceeds to solo a short piece of his own

design: Funky Cold Medina, 5.10a, a corner overhanging 160 feet of air.<p>

A difficult route can take months for a climber to place. The completed route

is christened and rated by its author. Subsequent climbers will confirm or

challenge the rating (climbs are often downgraded as climbers work out easier

sequences over time), and soon the route will appear, immortalized, in local

climbing guides. <p>

Osman takes immense care in the creation of his routes, his greatest

satisfaction being praise from other climbers for the spare beauty of his

"lines." He regards each climb as a monument, not only to its creator but also

to the climbers of generations past who attempted the route

unsuccessfully--with equal boldness but inferior technology--and to those who

follow and attempt the route.<p>

From Funky Cold Medina, Osman continues to another of his creations, Buttons of

Gold, 5.9+, named for the tawny nipples of rock that serve as holds. He then

moves through the boulders that crown the broad-backed outcropping, executing

short, powerful sequences on overhangs an arm's length from the ground. He

leaps from stone to stone. <p>

Carrying the coiled rope over his shoulder, Osman crosses to the eastern prow

of the outcropping, stepping lightly in his rock shoes over beards of crusted

snow. He drops down into a notch and emerges beneath and to the side of a

swollen bulge of granite that droops over the vertical rock face like the cap

of an enormous mushroom. A horizontal crack, centimeters to inches in width,

runs laterally forty feet along the joint between the bulge and the face, and

curves obliquely around the rock to disappear. From this crack a climber who

fell unchecked would travel 280 feet to the ground, glancing once off a sloping

ledge midway. <p>

Osman anchors the rope, ties in, and whitens both sides of his hands with

powdered gymnastic chalk from a pouch at his waist. The chalk marginally

protects the hands and keeps them dry of sweat. <p>

The climb is Blood in My Chalk Bag, 5.11c/d. Squatting on a ledge near the

beginning of the route, Meeks will serve as Osman's belayer, feeding the rope

through a device that will help him brace any fall that occurs. <p>

Osman grimaces faintly, nagged by three recently broken ribs (snowboard, tree),

and stretches his torso. He slowly releases a breath and begins his passage

horizontally along the crack. <p>

The footholds on the face below the crack are meager. Most of Osman's weight,

in a technique known as smearing, is supported by the friction of his sticky

rubber soles against the texture of the vertical granite. He carefully jams his

left hand deep into the crack. With his right he unclips a Friend--a

spring-loaded camming device--from a loop on his harness. Holding the device

like a depressed syringe, he inserts the head into the section of the crack

best suited to its width. When he releases the trigger, the opposing cams, or

curved wedges, expand and seize the rock with metal teeth. He tests the piece

with a tug, clips his rope into the carabiner that dangles from the Friend by a

nylon loop, and continues. The carabiner is an oblong ring of aluminum alloy

about the length of an avocado and equipped with a spring-loaded gate. A

semantic cousin of Italy's enduring <i>carabiniere</i>, the carabiner,

ubiquitous in climbing, was originally invented to clip carbine rifles to

bandoliers. A climbing carabiner's minimum breaking strength in the direction

of its long axis is about 4,400 pounds.<p>

While still well below the limit of Osman's ability, Blood in My Chalk Bag is

rigorous. In contrast to his style on Earn Your Wings, Osman's execution here

is simian, dynamic, a display of tenacity and brute strength. Some of his

positions appear awkward, out of balance, but he is climbing as the route

demands. With his right hand and right foot jammed in the crack, Osman pauses

briefly, hangs to rest, slackens his opposing limbs. Soon he vanishes around

the bulge and finishes the climb. <p>

Meeks, whom Osman has known for less than a week, decides to follow, cleaning

the route of its protection as he goes. Osman will belay from the same ledge.

Meeks is soon in trouble. Although he is skilled on faces, his crack technique

is no match for the route. His progress is painstaking. Osman coaches, move by

move. The light fails in the snow-dusted valley below. The temperature drops. A

Friend resists extraction. Meeks wrestles with the recalcitrant piece, swears

at it, and finally falls. Osman braces and holds Meeks in place. Meeks hangs on

the protection and rests. The darkness deepens. Placing another device beside

it to relieve his weight, Meeks finally gets the Friend out and continues. He

finishes the climb and appears on the crest of the bulge, silhouetted against

the dying sky. <p>

Osman is not his teacher, but the role is unavoidable given the discrepancy in

age and skill. Coiling the rope, he praises Meeks's effort but gently

reprimands him for not being entirely honest with himself or with Osman about

his skill in relation to the route, the time, and the conditions. Meeks nods,

visibly abashed. In the silence that follows, he holds out his hands as if

examining a manicure. He looks thoughtfully at the blood-spotted chalk on his

knuckles and smiles with pride.<p><pre>



</pre>

<font size=5>T</font>HE following morning Osman and company appear out of the mist at Cave Rock.

The Cave, as it is known, is an ominous and nobly situated vault--like half of

a cathedral's dome--hewn by erosion from the andesite cliff far above the

fog-swept eastern shoreline of Lake Tahoe. It is the kind of cave, were it

found in the Aegean, in which Olympian divinities might have been born. <p>

Osman ties in to the rope and steps from the gravel floor onto the wall of the

cave. With the delicacy of a watchmaker and the strength of a longshoreman he

climbs up and out across the arching roof, his back to the ground. Maliska

belays from the ground. The route Osman follows is his own: Phantom Lord,

5.13c. He has crafted more technically demanding climbs, like the adjacent

Slayer, 5.13d/14a (a route praised by Wolfgang G&uuml;llich as the most elegant

he'd ever seen), but none rivals Phantom Lord for boldness.<p>

Arriving at the end of the underside of the seventy-foot overhang, Osman rounds

the lip of the cave's roof and continues up the cliffside's natural contour. In

ten moves he is at the anchor: a steel ring, or "hanger," bolted to the rock.

He has finished the route and for a moment rests. Then he prepares to fall.<p>

Balanced on the cliff, he calls for slack. Maliska feeds the rope while Osman

lowers it in a long loop between his harness and the last piece of protection

near the lip. The length of slack will be the distance of Osman's free fall:

sixty-five feet. Maliska secures the rope in the belaying device on his own

harness. Thus attached, he will serve as Osman's counterweight through the

fulcrum of the anchor overhead. Upon Osman's impact on the rope, Maliska will

spring in the direction of the pull. The force of the fall will pluck him a

short distance into the air. An inflexible, or "static," belay would rob Osman

of the necessary give and catapult him in and up against the cavern's jagged

roof at a speed approaching sixty miles an hour. The error of a static belay

has already been made: another belayer of Osman's leaned back instinctively to

brace a similar but accidental fall. The resulting impact broke both of Osman's

ankles.<p>

Osman careens out away from the cliff and plummets earthward, limbs flung wide.

He completes two cartwheels, swings gracefully into the lower recesses of the

cave, and swoops back out into space. Maliska hangs in his harness, legs braced

against the wall, twelve feet above the gravel floor.<p>

In the process of perfecting such a fall Osman has done more than simply

grapple with his fears. By greatly exaggerating the conditions of normal

climbing falls, he has in five years gathered enough data potentially to

revolutionize the technology and application of climbing protection. He is

currently designing or modifying equipment, including protection and belaying

devices, and developing techniques--including body positioning before and

during impact on the rope--to improve the safety of long climbing falls. His

work will certainly prevent injuries, and may save lives on the rock. <p>

But there are costs. In May of 1994 Bobby Tarver, a twenty-five-year-old bungee

jumper in Osman's circle of close friends, was killed replicating one of

Osman's falls. Unable to accompany Tarver to the site, Osman first attempted to

forestall him and then precisely diagrammed the fall. Tarver was impatient.

"You could see it in his eyes," Osman says. "He was looking at the paper but he

wasn't listening." Tarver proceeded to a bridge that spans a Utah canyon,

failed to execute a simple preliminary step, and fell 250 feet to strike the

canyon wall. Dangling from the bridge, he was recovered by his companions. He

regained consciousness briefly and died three hours later. <p>

Osman has returned to that bridge on several occasions since the accident,

three times to jump. Twice he retreated. He finally descended into the canyon

and spoke with Tarver, as he put it. He then remounted the bridge, ignored

technical refinements made since the tragedy, and jumped according to the plan

he diagrammed that morning in May. <p><pre>



</pre>

<font size=5>A</font>T the time of my visit Osman lived 	alone in a warm, 

sepulchral studio

200 yards from the shore of Lake Tahoe. The bed, couch, chair, and table in the

main room abutted like puzzle pieces. Along one wall stood a workbench layered

with climbing hardware: camming devices, chocks, carabiners, ice axes,

snowshoes, crampons, a red helmet. A rope lay coiled over a vise. Propped

against an electric-guitar amplifier was a red-and-yellow backpack, a prototype

of Osman's design for The North Face, a prominent outdoor-equipment

manufacturer. Two snowboards leaned in the corner by the door. There was a

small television and an ample collection of rock-climbing videos. Seven or

eight books stood on a bedside table, all of them concerned with Japanese

history and the samurai, including an epic novel about the life of Musashi,

James Clavell's <i>Shogun</i>, and <i>The Samurai Sword--A Handbook</i>.

Photographs of Osman's daughter, Emma, age eight (now living with her mother),

were visible from every angle in the apartment. On the walls were posters, a

balance of heavy-metal bands--notably Metallica--and climbers on varying

terrain. Twice appearing was <A HREF="http://s2.com/rms/rms95/rmsaug95/hill.html">Lynn Hill</A>, a groundbreaking climber now working at

the top of her form. Osman cited Hill, along with the prominent alpinist and

photographer Jay Smith, Wolfgang G&uuml;llich, and the legendary soloist John

Bachar (pronounced <i>Backer</i>), as exemplars.<p>

From beneath his bed Osman reverently withdrew a Japanese long sword, or

<i>katana</i>, its curved scabbard covered in blackened sharkskin. The sword's

hilt was veneered with the dimpled ivory hide of a stingray and bound in a

lattice of burnt-orange silk. Four centuries old, the blade was nicked and

smudged in places by corrosion. The sword had certainly seen use. <p>

Returning from the Pacific with a U.S. serviceman, the weapon came into the

hands of Osman's father in exchange for a shotgun. Les Osman presented the

<i>katana</i> to his son in an informal ceremony on Thanksgiving Day, 1994.

Considering himself undeserving, the younger Osman attempted to decline it. <p>

"He had earned the right to have possession of the sword," Les Osman, once

skeptical of his son's vocation, now recalls. "Doing the work that I do, I have

faced death many, many, many times. When it's over, you celebrate the fact that

you're alive, you celebrate the fact that you have a family, you celebrate the

fact that you can breathe. Everything, for a few instants, seems sweeter,

brighter, louder. And I think this young man has reached a point where his

awareness of life and living are far beyond what I could ever 

achieve."<p><pre>



</pre>

 <font size=5>O</font>N the day of my scheduled fall I wake at four in the morning in the excessive

heat of a motel room in Stateline, California, and see Tarver hanging from a

rope in the middle of the Utah canyon. <p>

Hours later I remain uncommitted as I stand at the edge of the overhanging

cliff across the road from Cave Rock, far above the boulders on the shore of

Lake Tahoe. At a lateral distance from the anchor, I am attached to the cliff

by a slender hanging arc of nylon. <p>

Earlier, in the car, I suggested the possibility of a second rope, a backup,

should one fail. "You could do that," Osman answered. He reflected, weighing

his words. "But . . . that's not really what it's about." He seemed to object

to my suggestion not in judgment of my cowardice, which his expression seemed

to say was my affair, but in defense of ritual. As if, because he knows a

second rope to be superfluous, the aesthetic, and thus the spirit, of my jump

would be defiled. <p>

A thin layer of mist hangs like a belt above the western shore, bisecting the

snow-covered peaks that rise beyond. The lake is vast, an inland sea. <p>

Osman points. "Do you see the rock that looks like a skull?" The large stone is

pale, ninety-five feet directly below, the sockets and mouth implied by dark

patches of lichen. "That is your landing zone," he says. "Step off and aim for

that rock." <p>

"Whatever you do," he continues, "don't jump out. Don't jump out. Don't jump

out. If you do, you may swing into the cliff." <p>

I ask Osman to check the anchor. I doubt the wisdom of this. I question my

motives. I question the technology involved. For some reason I do not question

Osman. He climbs up, checks the anchor, returns. I feel impelled to thank him,

to shake his hand. I continue to breathe. I stand facing the anchor, the

outside of my right foot flush with the edge of the precipice. <p>

In a mutation so swift as to be imperceptible, as if externally compelled, I

pass irreversibly through Osman's moment of choice. In the attenuated

heartbeats between the moment of commitment and the moment of execution, the

pooling fear distills, climaxes, and transmutes. The body, suddenly unbound,

becomes weightless, soaring in its position on the rock. The back straightens;

the head instinctively rises to the sky. A deep, luxurious passivity suffuses

the limbs. I have gained no stronger confidence in the equipment. I have in no

way lost the visceral suspicion that I may soon lie mangled on the rocks below.

I have simply been relieved of my command. <p>

I count to three and step off the cliff. The sensation of the fall begins at

once, without the anticipated poise in space. The shoreline within range of my

peripheral vision vaults skyward. The cliffside smears into a blur. The

acceleration exceeds all expectation. No dream fall, no gently arcing

adolescent cannonball from a high board, has prepared me for the rate of my

descent. I am not falling; I have been hurled--spiked, perhaps--with celestial

gusto from the sky. I lock my eyes on the skull between my feet. There is a

last spasm of panic, a final lashing of the dormant will. <p>

The free fall lasts little longer than two seconds, a mere thirty-five to forty

feet before the slack is out. The tension on the harness pulls me gently from

my course, directs me south into a long swing of 200 feet, parallel to the

overhanging cliff. I shout obscenely. The sky is full of angels. <p>

From across my shoulder I uncoil the remainder of the rope and let it fall. My

hands tremble as Idescend the rope, still swinging, to the shore. I finally

alight and stand upon the stones, freeing the anchor of my weight. Dan Osman

calls triumphantly from high upon the cliff. I accepted his temptation. I

leaped from the precipice and was upheld. <p>

	<i><font size=4>You can look down between your boots and see air: for a

rock climber, that's the beginning of peace.</i></font><p>

	<font size=5>D</font>awn broke a gorgeous blue, with white lettering. The lettering spelled--just a

moment, back into the mountain tent for my glasses, which I had stored in one

of my sneakers-- H. E. EVANS MIRACLE REVIVAL. The background for this

disturbing message, the blue that filled my field of vision, was a huge,

repainted school bus. It was parked seventy-five feet away, and its curtained

windows suggested that it was inhabited.<p>



<p>



The bus had not been there when we wheeled into the Mouth of Seneca, West

Virginia, camp-ground at midnight, late in June. At any rate we had not seen

it, but it surely was there now, ready to burst and spray holiness from here to

the Ohio border. A big satin flag hung nearby promised a "Holy Ghost Revival,

7:30 Nightly, Salvation &amp; Healing for the Soul." I knew something about

Pentecostal Bible-shouting, and I did not like the way this rock-climbing

expedition was beginning.<p>



<p>



I woke my friends and told them that we were under siege. The news charmed

them. Mike is a Jew, raised in Yonkers, and Felix is a wayward sprig of

Massachusetts Protestantism. Neither had any notion of the stupefying decibel

level of new-time oldfangled religion. They are city men from Washington, D.C.:

Mike an obscure government lawyer (which is to say one not involved in

Watergate) and Felix an officer of the Superior Court. To them the threat of a

revival meeting was the kind of fascinating country curiosity for which all

city men thirst, like the hand-cranked pay phone, whose number is 14, outside

Buck Harper's general store.<p>



<p>



Moreover, they said, the alternative to this private campground, which cost

twenty-five cents a night if you could find Buck Harper to pay him, was a vast

and uninviting public area now being taken over by Smokey Bear. Smokey was

building an expensive, round, glass-and-steel "climbing center" across the

road, just below the Seneca outcropping we had come to climb. Mike and Felix,

who had been climbing at Seneca long before Smokey learned to tie a butterfly

knot in a kernmantel rope and clip it to a carabiner, seemed morbidly depressed

by this evidence of progress.<p>



<p>



For two or three years now, they said, Smokey had been moving into the Seneca

Rocks. This spectacular complex of quartzite cliffs jutting out of West

Virginia pastureland has become one of the major climbing areas in the East,

perhaps as well known as New Hampshire's Cannon Mountain and New York's

Shawangunks. The trouble with Smokey was that he would bring more people to the

rocks, which already had so many climbers that the principal danger on weekends

was being clunked by stones and climbing gear dislodged by fools overhead.<p>



<p>



And, my friends went on gloomily, the people attracted by Smokey's rustic

signs, log-edged parking lots, and woodsy his-and-hers latrines would be inept

and leaderless climbers. The new popularity of climbing had brought enough

ineptitude to the rocks as it was--and, largely as a result, rescuers had had

to bring down three dead bodies and five live ones in the past eighteen months.

A great many rules would be necessary, painted on those brown log signboards

that Smokey carves so well. Something like "No Granny Knots, No Sneakers, No

Nude Climbing, No Dogs Except on Belay, No Climbing Unroped, No Pitons, Helmets

Must Be Worn, Climbing Hours Six A.M. to Eight P.M., Rocks Closed November to

May, All Climbs Must Be Approved by Climbing Ranger, No Rock Climbing While

Stoned." On balance, it seemed better to avoid Smokey while it was still

possible. Carefully, so as not to rouse the sleeping revivalists, we dug our

Coleman stove out of the car and made coffee.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Felix is lean, tough, bald, slight of build. He is forty-three years old, an

old Yosemite hand who has climbed for twenty-five years, mostly in the United

States, but also in the Alps, India, and Pakistan. At one time he thought of

making a career as a mountain guide. As a child he was severely ill with polio,

and he spent a year in an iron lung. Now he wears a steel brace on his left

calf, riveted to the heel of his climbing boot. This no longer seems to me the

most interesting of Felix's originalities, but it causes some stir among

climbers who don't know him when, on toes and fingertips, and climbing in the

exposed lead position, he begins to thread his way up a difficult face. Like

other fine mountaineers I know who have reached the age of reason, he did

things as a young climber that now seem daft to him. In his current phase he is

cautious and cerebral, a splendid teacher.<p>



<p>



Mike is ten years younger, short, quick, muscular, and fiery. He has too much

physical energy for a law office. Twenty years ago his sort raced Austin

Healeys on weekends. He began to climb three years ago, practicing with Felix

on small cliffs along the Potomac. Now he spends all of his spare time

climbing, or thinking about climbing. The existential act of inching up an

overhang on a vanishing crack has seized his mind and shaken it. He knows a lot

about gear, and a lot about technique. His own skill already approaches the

expert class, but he has not yet done any big, important climbs. He regards

Felix with awe, but knows that at some point he must break away from his

teacher. The prospect frightens him a little.<p>



<p>



I am forty-one and reasonably fit. In the last five years I have done a fair

amount of expedition climbing, which is mostly walking, and once, loony from

lack of oxygen, I hiked to 24,500 feet in the Hindu Kush region of northeastern

Afghanistan. That counts for a few points when I am drinking beer and

exchanging mountain lies with some scoundrelly friend, while his wife smiles

tensely and hopes that we don't start pulling out maps. (The maps mean some new

expedition is at the back of our adolescent minds, and when they come out wives

stop smiling. I don't blame them.)<p>



<p>



The fact is, however, that I have not progressed much past the beginning of

learning to be a rock climber. I have a pair of nicely scuffed climbing boots.

Heights don't make me dizzy. I can tie a bowline. Beyond these I have no gifts

to offer the frowning rock faces.<p>



<p>



The matter of my own stringy height, my friends have told me disapprovingly, is

ambivalent. I can reach handholds that Mike and Felix can only brood about. But

they have taken special care to point out that there are certain situations,

usually involving low holds and bulging overhangs, where a tall man's behind is

derricked out so far into thin air by his great awkward legs that his own

leverage peels him off the rock. At this point, they say, solemn as beadles,

the tall man's excessive mass, accelerating at thirty-two feet per second per

second, builds up so much extra momentum that safety margins are exceeded. The

shock through the length of his safety rope rips the mooring pitons from the

rock. The giant's loyal short colleagues strain to hold the rope, but fail, and

he arcs out, spinning, into the abyss.<p>



<p>



Felix reviewed all of this again in a friendly way, then threw the second half

of his second cup of coffee into the weeds. Well, he asked, what were we

waiting for?<p>



<p>



Between Mouth of Seneca, the crossroads town, and the startling blade of rock

that rises above it flows the North Fork of the South Branch of the Potomac

River. Its seventy-foot width is spanned by a suspension bridge, put together

long ago with some telephone poles for uprights, four cables, a few slats, and

some pieces of plywood. The bridge is motionless in repose, but moves like a

dying snake when stepped on, and it serves two purposes: to let climbers cross

the river, and to discourage picnickers from doing so. The climbers are

gloomily certain that Smokey Bear will replace the bridge.<p>



<p>



Beyond the river is the scree, loose, sliding rock broken off from the cliffs

above, fingering down through the trees. We scrabbled up the scree for twenty

minutes, feeling the morning's heat for the first time, then stopped to sort

out our packs at a flat place called Luncheon Ledge. Here farmland, river,

trees, and scree were finished. We leaned to rest against the vertical rise of

the cliff.<p>



<p>



We carried water, lunch, iron, and gorp. Gorp is a secret strengthening mixture

favored by climbers and other desperate types, consisting of peanuts, raisins,

dried apricots (optional), and bittersweet chocolate bits. Climbing ropes are

usually of the kernmantel type--woven nylon sheaths surrounding a nylon core,

eleven millimeters in diameter and 150 feet long, with a breaking strength of

several thousand pounds. We had three. Iron is the collective term for pitons

(variegated steel or light-alloy spikes to be driven into cracks), angles (wide

pitons), bongs (wide angles), chocknuts (odd-shaped bits of alloy, threaded

with nylon slings, that can be jammed into cracks in place of pitons),

carabiners (metal snap-rings used to attach ropes to pitons or to oneself),

hammers, and other gear. Iron in astonishing quantity is slung on loops of

gaudily colored nylon webbing. These loops circle a climber's neck and one of

his shoulders, so that the iron sags to waist level, tugging comfortably at the

wearer's self-image, giving him a feeling of weight and purpose.<p>



<p>



We stashed our packs and tied in to one of the ropes--Felix leading,

route-finding, ready to bang in pitons with his stubby, heavy-headed hammer; I

at the position of ignorance in the middle; Mike at the end, to offer me

whatever psychiatry was necessary, and to pull out the pitons Felix had sunk.<p>



<p>



Each of us had one additional duty: to take his turn at belaying the others. I

had done my first rock-climbing with a remarkable Austrian mountaineer named

Marcus, and on our first pitch, or rope-length section of cliff, he had said

very quietly, "Du haltest meine Leben." Marcus was not given to unnecessary

eloquence, and what he said startled me. But he was right. It is the strongest

of metaphors and the simplest of bald truths: each climber holds his partner's

life. Climbing partnerships are not entered into lightly.<p>



<p>



The climber does not budge till the belayer yells that he is ready and at that

point the belayer must be prepared to hold the climber, no matter how suddenly

and sharply he falls, and no matter for how many minutes he must be held. Arm

strength alone can't do this, especially if the arms are tired after several

hours of climbing, but if the belayer winds the climber's safety rope around

his own back, the friction of rope against cloth is enough to do the job fairly

easily.<p>



<p>



The belayer pulls in rope as the climber below him moves upward, limiting the

distance of a possible fall to the rope's few inches of slack. The leader

cannot be protected so well--he is belayed from below, and his safety rope runs

up through carabiners clipped to the pitons or chocknuts he has set. If he has

climbed ten feet from his last piton and loses his hold, he must fall ten feet

past the piton, and then another ten--the length of the untethered part of his

rope--before the belayer can begin to stop him. The rule is not hard to

memorize: The leader shall not fall.<p>



<p>



We moved up an easy path and around the back of the cliff structure. Unlike

most cliffs, the Seneca formation has a front and a back. Hold two hands side

by side and edge to edge, fingers together, and then imagine the fingers rising

to a height of about three hundred feet from a landscape of rolling woodland

and pasture. The west face of this high, narrow, ragged ridge is in view of the

river, the highway, and Smokey Bear's half-completed climbing center. Our path,

accurately labeled the Old Ladies' Route, led up a crack between two of the

huge quartzite fingers, and continued across an easy traverse onto the east

face.<p>



<p>



Climbs usually done with the help of ropes are graded from 5.0 to 5.9, and this

one was a lowly 5.1. Even I had wandered up far harder pitches unroped and

alone, but none of us had been in the mountains for a few weeks, and it seemed

possible that important nerve ends might have been dulled. The mildness of the

ascent did not shame me; for weeks I had held in my hands nothing more tangible

than the scribbled-over typescripts of magazine articles, and the warm rock

under my fingers felt solid and good. There is a point on the Old Ladies'

traverse at which you can look down between your boots and see air, and for a

climber this is the beginning of peace.<p>



<p>



Roosting on the knife-point of Seneca's South Peak, we ate gorp and admired

Germany Valley, a highland pasture hidden from the road that does, indeed, look

like one of the soft Alpine meadows of Bavaria. The actual Alpine meadows won't

exist much longer, I suspected, because the farm boys who should be scything

the grass are all in Munich working at the BMW factory, and I wondered looking

down between my dangling boots at Germany Valley, who had bothered to mow this

inconvenient field, and for what reason.<p>



<p>



We rapelled off the South Peak to a handy ledge. Rapelling is, in visual terms,

the most dramatic maneuver in the mountaineer's repertoire: a spider-like

descent on a doubled rope. Photographers love rapelling shots, because there is

a lot of photogenic air on all sides of the intrepid descender. The ratio of

apparent danger to real danger in rock climbing is, as Felix had admitted to

me, satisfyingly high. The reader is urged to remember, when he sees a photo of

some tiger rapelling, that a healthy six-year-old girl can be taught to perform

the stunt.<p>



<p>



Still warming up slowly, like elderly croquet players, we did another and

slightly harder climb called Conn's West. Then it rained. We jammed ourselves

into a vertical crack near Luncheon Ledge. The crack was about a foot wide, and

in it, in descending order and over a space of about eighteen feet, were Felix,

Mike, myself, and our three packs. Water poured off Felix onto Mike, and off

Mike onto me, wetting the pieces of salami we passed to each other. After a

time we left the crack and skidded down the scree to our camp.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



In the Mouth of Seneca campground there is a beat-up band pavilion, and

climbers who have no tents sleep there. We spread our wet gear on the raggedy

wooden bleachers to dry. A kid climber had arrived, a boy of about sixteen who

had hitchhiked the two hundred miles or so from Athens, Ohio. He had started

climbing eleven months before and already had accumulated at least eighty

pounds of splendid equipment. He asked questions about our tents, our packs,

and our ropes, and wistfully, wanting to be invited along, asked what route we

were going to climb the next day.<p>



<p>



Toward evening, after the rain had stopped, mud-splotched West Virginia cars

began to cruise through the campground toward the H. E. Evans Miracle Revival.

They would stop by the snow fence bordering the field where the revivalists had

set up their stage and folding chairs. Sometimes the drivers would turn off

their engines, sometimes not, but in a few minutes the cars would move on

again, bellying through the puddles toward the highway. It was impossible to

say whether the people driving in and out again were sightseers, or revival

connoisseurs, or simply citizens who were afraid that the rain might begin once

more. But when the squall of rock hymns ended and the sermon began, there were

only four or five customers in the seats, and four trapped climbers in the band

pavilion. H. E. Evans appeared. He was a tall, beefy man of about forty-five,

and he wore a white shirt and black pants. Through the microphone his voice

sounded harsh and full of resentment. He said, yelling, that it was a terrible

thing to fall into he hands of an angry god.<p>



<p>



Morning: up the scree again, glasses fogged in the green heat. Then out of the

trees, clear of the world, and up a rising corner of cliff. Felix was

improvising, following a route not in the guidebook. The climbing was harder.

No supernatural moves were required, but often there was only one hold that

would allow the route to continue, and concentration was necessary to figure

out how to use it.<p>



<p>



Climbing at this modest level is puzzle-solving. The journeyman rock-scrambler,

standing in perfect comfort on a three-quarter-inch ledge, his hands solidly

anchored by a finger or two, feeling quite jaunty because he has remembered to

keep his weight away from the rock (so that his boots press firmly on his

ledge) rather than to hug the rock (which would cause his boots to press

outward and slide off the ledge)--this self-assured citizen sees a promising

indentation that he can reach with the side of the toe of either boot. It is a

chess problem: if he uses the left foot, there is a fine jug (a projection that

gives an unshakable handhold) within reach of his right hand. But if he uses

the jug, his right foot will be way out of position, scraping helplessly on a

surface as slick as a refrigerator door.<p>



<p>



All right, forget that, start with the right foot, but what happens then? (This

deliberation is taking time, and fingers and forearms are beginning to feel the

tension.) Oh, yeah, Felix must have used that fleck up to the left, he had to,

he got up somehow. And what the hell, if I peel off he's got me on belay.<p>



<p>



Second-man psychology: sloppy and comfortable. Some discomfort-loving part of

me, probably the character flaw that got me into the mountains in the first

place as I neared middle age, did not approve of being second man on a rope. I

wanted to lead. Never mind that my technique regularly left me hanging at the

end of a line like a salami in a butcher shop, while sweat popped out of the

forehead of whatever suffering friend was pulling on the rope's other end to

keep me from falling further.<p>



<p>



We reached the Gunsight, a spectacular notch bisected by a thirty-foot gendarme

which, from the Seneca valley, does look like the bead of a rifle's sight. I

was full of plans and chatter, pointing out routes up the Gendarme (the sole

whimsy in all of climbing nomenclature is that smallish columns standing alone

like traffic cops are called gendarmes). My ambition was not well disguised,

but it was ignored. Felix looked at me, smiled gravely, and said that we were

going to do Triple S. He did not have to say that he would lead.<p>



<p>



In the guidebook to Seneca Rocks, Shipley's Shivering Shimmy is listed between

"Agony" and the "Horrendous Traverse" as a 5.8 ascent of 160 feet, "by common

consent one of the classic climbs in the eastern U.S.A." The grading of rock

climbs is a matter of hunch and feel and put-down-manship. Climbers have been

known to make truly evil ascents by new routes, and then to grade them "oh,

about 5.6." The put-down comes when another hotshot tries to get up the thing,

and figures that if he is all bent out of shape on a 5.6 climb, he had better

quit and take up bowling.<p>



<p>



When the grading is accurate, 5.8 is too hard for me. Once or twice I have made

a 5.7 move successfully after a good climber has demonstrated each step. On my

own, I have found my way up 5.4 and 5.5 pitches without disaster. But 5.8 is

supernatural. Wisely, Felix planned to cheat. The 5.8 grade for Triple S counts

only when the thing is climbed free--which means when the climber's whole

weight is on the rock the whole time, and not on a piton, sling, or safety

rope. Felix, who probably could have done Triple S free, intended to turn the

pitch into an aid climb. On the hard parts, he would carry his weight on two

etriers, or small ladders knotted from nylon webbing.<p>



<p>



Triple S follows the right-angle intersection of two sheer faces, one of which

is called the Face of a Thousand Pitons, because the Tenth Mountain Division

trained there during World War II and left a lot of iron behind. Iron in those

days was actually made of soft iron, and when the pitons were driven into a

crack, they bent, jammed, and stayed there. Modern pitons are made of steel,

and most of them can be retrieved. Not all of them, however, and even pitons

that are pulled out by conscientious and thrifty climbers abrade the cracks

they are hammered into. The result is that the Seneca Rocks and the other great

climbing walls are wearing out. There are climbers today, most of them very

young, who will not use pitons. Since the chocknuts they use instead are less

versatile and also less secure, their idealism limits the climbs they can do.

It also limits their margins of safety by a degree that is alarming to the

older climbers.<p>



<p>



I belayed, standing on a broad, sloping ledge, and Mike stood nearby to watch

as Felix worked up the crack. His pitons were going in well. They made a clear

ringing sound, rising in pitch: "pock-puck-pick-pink-ping-PING." Suddenly,

about thirty-five feet up, he yelled, "ROCK!" Holding the belay, I flattened

myself against the rock wall, shielded by a slight overhang. Mike lunged for

the same spot. Our shoulders banged together, and he staggered toward the edge

of the ledge as the saucer-sized rock Felix had dislodged snicked by us. Mike

kept his footing. We looked at each other. He and Felix are extremely careful

climbers, and as a matter of course they had seen to it that I, as the belayer,

was tied into the cliffside with a sling and piton. Now, without saying a word,

Mike tied himself in too.<p>



<p>



Felix made another ten feet, going more slowly, working much harder. Then rain

began to fall hard. In two minutes he had rapelled off the face and was

standing beside us. Leaving about $250 worth of equipment nailed to Triple S.

we walked down soggily to the campground. Felix and Mike were uneasy about the

ropes and iron. Not all of the new climbers were idealists. On an earlier visit

to Seneca, they had cached their equipment halfway up a wall one night, and had

recovered it the next morning only after chasing two kid bandits up a long,

vertical face.<p>



<p>



Several schoolboy climbers, not bandits but glossy suburban young, had arrived

at the band pavilion when we returned. Like the first boy we had met, they were

gloriously overequipped. Magnificent high-loft down sleeping bags, giant packs

and frames suitable for an attack on Nanga Parbat. Bright lengths of nylon

webbing in purple, green, and orange. Splendid light-alloy match holders.

Glossy coils of new rope. Jumar ascenders. A bosun's chair, for resting while

climbing El Capitan. Quantities of unscratched chocknuts. No pitons. Lots of

chatter, scornful, anxious, rattling with brand names: "Kelty!" "Chouinard!"

"Stubai!" (Chopped and channeled Fords. I thought to myself, mistily. Moon

disks. Duals...)<p>



<p>



One tall, weedy blond kid of about seventeen did have scratches on his gear. He

and Felix recognized each other and exchanged a few words. They had seen each

other practicing at Carderock, on the Potomac near Washington. Felix said the

boy was very good. "He and some of the others scare me, though," he went on.

"I've seen them go up crazy pitches without a rope, solo. They're too young to

know you can get hurt."<p>



<p>



The blond kid began an aid climb up the inside of the pavilion root. He clipped

himself to a series of bright purple slings, looped over the rafters, as the

other boys stopped jabbering and watched. He would be a fine climber, said

Felix, if he lived to be twenty-five.<p>



<p>



To no one except members of his own troupe, spread among the wet folding chairs

to look like a congregation, H. E. Evans preached about the pleasures of the

flesh, which he deplored, and whose ill effects he blamed mostly on women. He

described with approval the death of Jezebel, torn apart by the dogs of Jezreel

for defying the priests with her shamelessness. "And eaten!" roared H. E. Evans

triumphantly. "Every! Last! Sinful! Morsel! All except her feet, which had

carried her from the ways of righteousness! And her heart, which lusted after

foah-nuh-cation! And her hay-unds..."<p>



<p>



Mike and Felix had heard enough of country quaintness by now, so we got in our

car and drove down the road for a while. After a few miles we found a

launderateria, and we threw our wet climbing pants into a dryer and watched

them spin.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The next morning we lazed around camp waiting for the rocks to dry. H. E. Evans

walked by on his way to the crossroads store and nodded affably.<p>



<p>



In the afternoon Felix finished nailing his way up Triple S. It was a complex,

wearing job, worth doing because...<p>



<p>



(There is no way to end the previous sentence in a manner that is satisfactory

to climbers and understandable to non-climbers. "Because it is there," said

Mallory, banging a gong that has resounded in the skulls of flatlanders ever

since. The question was why he climbed his mountain. The answer was an Everest

of pomposity. This is worth wondering about because Mallory is said to have

been anything but a pompous man. A possibility, I think, is that what he

intended to convey was, "Go away and stop asking good questions." The

mountaineers I know, even such highly intellectual ones as Felix, have sharply

limited patience with speculation about why they climb. "Sagst du, weil es

freut uns!" said an Austrian friend irritably: tell them we climb because it

pleases us. Flatlanders will be ready with murky psychological analysis, but

the correct answer is irreducible: climbers climb for the same reason that

smoke rises and poodles bite doormen. It is their nature.)<p>



<p>



I followed Felix, not quite so cocky as I had been the day before. I was not

really rock-climbing, merely rope-climbing on my etriers; handling knots,

unclipping and re-clipping carabiners as I passed Felix's pitons over a rise of

something more than one hundred feet. The physical effort required was only

moderate and mostly unnecessary, caused by my clumsiness as etriers caught

under my feet or on the rock sides of the corner I was ascending. The mental

effort was intense. I had to ignore the gulf of air under and behind me, and

the unsettling elasticity of one hundred feet of nylon rope, and to concentrate

on making no move whose effect I had not worked out logically. There was a

moment of stage fright halfway up, five or six stories in the air, when it was

necessary to transfer from one belay rope to another. For an awkward bit of

time my fingers could not remember how to make a figure-8 knot on a bight,

something they have known since I was twelve.<p>



<p>



Then, of course, the rope sorted itself into a proper knot, and I clipped

myself to it and all was well. My movements became smoother as bits of

technique began to make sense. In a few more minutes, after perhaps a quarter

of an hour on the wall, I pulled myself over the brow of the face and thanked

Felix for the belay. Enjoying the rough feel of the rock under me, I tied

myself to a piton and lay back to absorb the sun. Mike clattered up the rope,

pulling pitons and yelling. In a few minutes we were all sitting in a windy gap

called Windy Gap, eating gorp and thinking well of ourselves.<p>



<p>



Felix, who knew I wanted to write something about rock-climbing, apologized for

not swanning off the cliff in a newsworthy leader-fall. I said I thought the

material I had was OK. I remember thinking that rock-climbing was a cerebral,

contemplative sport, something like golf, but without golf's damaging

tensions.<p>



<p>



When we got back to the band pavilion, the kid climbers were nowhere in sight.

Then we looked up at the underside of the roof, and there they all were,

clipped to the rafters and hanging like bats.<p>



<p>



H. E. Evans' blue school bus was parked beside the road. The revival cannot

have taken in enough quarters in the collection basket to fill the tank with

gas, but the motor was running, and after a time the bus moved off in the

direction of Ohio.

Gillespie symbolizes jazz to audiences and musicians alike</i></b></font></center>

	</pre>

	

	

	<font size=5>T</font>HOUGH it's a touch grotesque, the artist Mark Diamond's hologram of Dizzy

Gillespie is lifelike enough to halt you in your tracks as you hurry past the

jazz club called Fat Tuesday's, on Third Avenue between 17th and 18th, in New

York. Gillespie--white-haired even to the tuft under his lip and looking close

to his present age of seventy-four--smiles and lifts his trumpet to his lips

(it's that oddly designed horn of his, with the bell tilted up away from the

tubing and valves). Then he swells his cheeks into enormous pouches and blows,

his neck expanding too, before the movements reverse and he smiles again, this

time as though acknowledging applause.<p>



<p>



Gillespie follows you into Fat Tuesday's, where there is a large poster of him

to the far left of the bandstand. And on a wall opposite the bandstand at the

Blue Note, a club a few blocks west and several blocks south, where I heard

Gillespie perform with his quintet last year, there is a mural showing a much

younger Gillespie in action with some of bebop's other progenitors, including

Charlie Parker, on a similar bandstand in the 1940s.<p>



<p>



At one point last year Gillespie seemed to be everywhere I looked. I saw him on

TV with Johnny Carson, Joan Rivers, and Arsenio Hall (unlike most guests on

their programs, he wasn't promoting new "product"--he was just being Dizzy

Gillespie), and on the promos for "The Soul of American Music," a black

music-awards show on which he appeared to be the token jazz musician. He even

turned up last year in an issue of <I>Bon Appetit</I>, in which it was revealed that

he once feasted on crocodile in Zaire and that the only thing he ever cooks at

home is a breakfast of salmon with grits. In New York last June, I heard him at

three different shows in one week, all presented as part of the JVC Jazz

Festival. One of these was a tribute to Doc Cheatham, an indefatigable

trumpeter twelve years Gillespie's elder. The others were memorials for Dexter

Gordon and Sarah Vaughan, both of whom died in 1990, and both of whom made

their first important records with Gillespie, in the 1940s.<p>



<p>



Gillespie, exercising a monarch's noblesse oblige, also appeared, unbilled, at

"Bebop, Forty and Under," a JVC program that I missed. The reviews indicated

that Gillespie, the oldest man on stage by several decades, had set the pace

for the trumpeters Jon Faddis, Roy Hargrove, and Wallace Roney on three numbers

that climaxed the show, one of which was his own "A Night in Tunisia" (which he

first recorded with Vaughan, in 1944, under the title "Interlude").<p>



<p>



At the three concerts I did see, Gillespie appeared to be struggling with his

intonation and reluctant to test his upper register, although he compensated by

delivering savory, low-pitched blues licks behind the singers Joe Williams and

Billy Eckstine at the tribute to Vaughan. Both this show and the one honoring

Gordon were somber affairs, at which the mortality of the senior musicians on

stage supplied an unstated theme. In contrast, the evening for Cheatham, though

overlong and indifferently paced, teemed with unruly virtuosity--most of it

supplied by Faddis and the trumpeters Wynton Marsalis and Ruby Braff.<p>



<p>



Even so, whenever Gillespie moseyed onstage, he instantly became the center of

attention, and the other musicians seemed to huddle around him, as if waiting

for their cues. In the sense that this concert and the others during the

week--including "Bebop, Forty and Under"--amounted to opportunities to take

measure of the small gains won and the enormous losses suffered by jazz in

recent years, none of them would have been complete without Gillespie's

participation. At this point he symbolizes jazz to those who play it and those

who listen to them.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>G</font>ILLESPIE also symbolizes jazz to those outside that circumscribed orbit. His

name isn't included among the things that E. D. Hirsch, Jr. thinks "literate

Americans know," but then again, neither is Marlon Brando's. Lacking a hit

single such as "Mack the Knife" or "Hello, Dolly," Gillespie isn't universally

recognized and cherished the way Louis Armstrong was, and the likelihood is

that no jazz instrumentalist ever will be. Still, with the recent death of

Miles Davis, Gillespie is probably the only living figure from jazz whose

name--reminiscent of a time when musicians as well as ballplayers were called

things like "Dizzy," "Duke," and "Pee Wee"--rings a bell for most people.

Gillespie is suddenly famous again, just as he was in the late 1940s, when

bebop's virtues were being debased in the mainstream press and (as a glance at

Richard O. Boyer's delightful 1948 New Yorker profile of Gillespie reminds us)

the style was identified in the public imagination with such stereotypes as

berets, goatees, dark glasses, Meerschaum pipes, Islam, and flatted

fifths--that day's equivalents of baseball caps turned backward, "fade"

haircuts, sneakers, hood ornaments worn as medallions, Afrocentricism, and DJ

mixes.<p>



<p>



Bebop's image has changed over the decades, and so has Gillespie's. In his

youth he was regarded first as a rebel without a cause, on account of his

antics as a big-band sideman in the late thirties and early forties, and then

as a rebel with one, after his musical experiments and those of Parker and a

handful of others gradually coalesced into jazz's first avant-garde movement.

Today bebop is accepted on faith as classic even by people unsure of whether

they've ever actually heard any, and Gillespie is venerated for having been one

of its chief oracles, second in importance only to Parker, who died in 1955 and

is therefore a phantom to us. Although the number of people able to name even

one of Gillespie's tunes might be small, millions of newspaper readers and

television viewers recognize that "bent" horn and those puffed-out cheeks.<p>



<p>



What's missing from this image of Gillespie is what's unavoidably missing 

from that hologram of him in the window of Fat Tuesday's--the crackle of 

his music.  Most accounts of Gillespie's career understandably dwell on his 

accomplishments in the 1940s, when every note he played was accepted as 

history in the making.  But I happen to think that he reached his zenith in 

the early 1960s, a period in which he wasn't so much underrated (he has 

never been underrated) as taken for granted amid the clamor surrounding 

Ornette Coleman's free jazz, Miles Davis's and John Coltrane's modes, and 

Horace Silver's and Art Blakey's funk.  This opinion is based, of 

necessity, on out-of-print records, such as <I>Something Old, Something 

New</I>, which featured what was arguably Gillespie's finest band, with the 

then very young pianist Kenny Barron and the saxophonist and flutist James 

Moody, and <I>Gillespiana</I>, an album-length suite written by the pianist Lalo 

Schifrin, Barron's predecessor in Gillespie's group.  (One of several 

orchestral works commissioned by Gillespie around that time, in a futile 

attempt to beat Miles Davis and Gil Evans at their own game, 

<I>Gillespiana</I> has aged surprisingly well, and Gillespie still 

frequently plays its "Blues" section with his quintet.)  Records, of 

course, can be misleading.  But a friend of mine, who heard Gillespie in 

nightclubs on numerous occasions during this period, confirms my impression 

that Gillespie was then topping himself nightly.<p>



<p>



<p>



Gillespie was so much the compleat trumpeter that it was difficult to say which

was more impressive--his ease in unfurling lengthy and rhythmically compounded

phrases or the inflections he could squeeze out of one note. His high notes

whistled, and he tossed off entire choruses above the staff. His low notes,

when he held them, frequently sounded the way he does when pronouncing the name

of his birthplace: "Chee-<I>roh</I>, South Carolina," spelled "Cheraw." (Although

bebop was an urban phenomenon, it's worth considering that Gillespie and

Parker, its pace-setters, grew up on or near farmland.) Filled with passing

chords and other harmonic brainteasers, Gillespie's solos nonetheless had a

rich sarcasm about them that immunized them against excess abstraction.<p>



<p>



In jazz as in classical music, there are two types of virtuosity: the

utilitarian and the utopian. The utilitarian--that of an Oscar Peterson or a

Freddie Hubbard--leaves you feeling that you've just heard a musician

unsurpassed at what he does. The utopian--that of Gillespie, Parker, Armstrong,

Cecil Taylor, Sonny Rollins, and Art Tatum--momentarily persuades you that

human knowledge has evolved to such an extent that nothing is impossible. There

was nothing that could be done on a trumpet that Gillespie in his prime could

not do, and nothing imaginable either rhythmically or harmonically that he

hadn't seemingly already thought of.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>R</font>EVIEWERS used to scold Gillespie for wasting so much of his time onstage

joking around or playing Latin percussion, in an apparent effort to save his

lip. But even though less effort is now expected of Gillespie (he is in his

eighth decade, after all), he continues to circle the globe as though

campaigning for James Brown's title "The Hardest-Working Man in Show Business."

Following JVC, for example, he spent all but a few days of July playing

concerts and festivals in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. He practically

lived on the road the rest of the year, appearing in both Brazil and California

in a single week in September, and, between engagements in Tokyo and San Juan,

spending just a few days at home with his wife of fifty years, Lorraine, in New

Jersey during the Christmas holidays.<p>



<p>



Gillespie spoke with me from a Monterey, California, hotel room in October. I

asked him if he could envision a day in the near future when he would begin to

take life easier. "You can't take it easy on the trumpet," he replied. "You

have to keep at it all the time." He told me that he thought his sound was now

"brighter" and "better" than ever before, as a result of a new mouthpiece that

he acquired early last year.<p>



<p>



But the melancholy fact is that Gillespie's prowess has diminished to the point

where hearing him attempt to swap high notes with his protege, Jon Faddis, at

the Doc Cheatham tribute was like seeing the picture of Dorian Gray side by

side with the still-unblemished Dorian. Virtuosity is as much mechanical as

intellectual, and age delights in robbing virtuosos of the edge they took for

granted. Doc Cheatham remains a marvel at the age of eighty-six, but his style

never depended on fireworks displays, even when he was younger. Gillespie's

did, and he is no longer able to light up the skies with any regularity.<p>



<p>



Gillespie still surrounds himself with excellent musicians, however, and he

still has his moments. At the Blue Note, where his group included Ron Holloway,

an unheralded tenor saxophonist from Baltimore whose solos achieved that

remarkable combination of angularity and heft which has long been associated

with Sonny Rollins, I heard Gillespie play a blues full of wry shadings and

comically deployed silences. He might have been lacking in the bravura that one

used to expect from Gillespie, but it was a fine solo by any other conceivable

measure.<p>



<p>



Gillespie remains a prolific recording artist, and each of the three albums

released by him last year has much to recommend it. On <I>Bebop and Beyond Plays

Dizzy Gillespie</I> (Blue Moon R2 79170) he joins a Bay Area group led by the

saxophonist and flutist Mel Martin for a batch of tunes either written by or

associated with him. He even turns in an affecting vocal: Gil Fuller's

beautiful "I Waited for You," a ballad that was written for and recorded by

Gillespie's big band in 1946. Although the trumpet solos that catch the ear

with their imagination and clean execution tend to be those of Bebop and

Beyond's Warren Gale, Gillespie is clearly the catalyst on this generally

spirited session. The two tracks he sits out are run-of-the-mill, latter-day

West Coast bebop.<p>



<p>



In 1990 Gillespie starred in and wrote the music for Jose A. Zorilla's <I>The

Winter in Lisbon</I>, a European film that only recently found an American

distributor. To judge from the synopsis that Gillespie gave me during our

telephone conversation, Zorilla's movie explores the same ground that Bertrand

Tavernier's <I>'Round Midnight</I> did. Gillespie plays a disgruntled black expatriate

who forms a bond with a young white pianist who worships him. Apparently

there's also a subplot involving the pianist's girlfriend, a gangster whose

mistress she used to be, and a stolen painting.<p>



<p>



The soundtrack was finally released last summer (Milan 73138 35600-2), and the

problem with it is the problem with most soundtracks: motifs reworked <I>ad

infinitum</I> in the interest of dramatic continuity just sound repetitive when

extracted from their <I>mise-en scene</I>. But what makes this soundtrack well worth

hearing are the selections featuring Gillespie with the pianist Danilo Perez,

the bassist George Mraz, and the drummer Grady Tate, who prod triumphant salvos

from him on "San Sebastan," and elsewhere encourage from him an

uncharacteristic lyricism so intimate that even the notes he flubs seem fraught

with meaning.<p>



<p>



Perez, whose spacious chordal approach recalls that of Bill Evans, although his

touch is more percussive, is also the pianist on<I>Live at the Royal Festival

Hall</I> (Enja R2 79658), a London concert recording demonstrating the many virtues

of Gillespie's United Nation Orchestra, the fifteen-member ensemble he has led

part-time since 1988. The United Nation Orchestra--so named because it includes

musicians from Cuba, Brazil, Panama, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican

Republic--draws heavily on the classic tunes written (or co-written) by

Gillespie which employ South American or Caribbean rhythms (his and Frank

Paparelli's "A Night in Tunisia," obviously, but also such durable items as his

calypso "And Then She Stopped" and his and Chano Pozo's modified rumba "Tin Tin

Deo"). By so doing, this new orchestra begs comparison to the most fabled of

Gillespie's big bands, the rough-and-ready one from the late 1940s which

briefly included Pozo on congas and blended bebop with mambo and elements of

Afro-Cuban ritualistic music. Although hardly as innovative as that band--or as

talent-laden as the one Gillespie assembled for a 1956 State Department tour

and managed to keep afloat for a year or so afterward (Lee Morgan, Phil Woods,

and Benny Golson all did stints in it)--this new outfit is likably volatile,

thanks in large part to the trombonist Slide Hampton's gutsy arrangements.<p>



<p>



Best of all, because the band is well stocked with such animated soloists as

the trumpeters Claudio Roditi and Arturo Sandoval, the saxophonists James

Moody, Mario Rivera, and Paquito D'Rivera, and the trombonist Steve Turre, who

also plays conch shells, Gillespie doesn't have to be the whole show as he

sometimes does with his small band (if only to leave his audiences feeling that

they've gotten their money's worth). What with showcases for Turre and

D'Rivera, plus one shared by the singer Flora Purim and the percussionist Airto

Moreira, Gillespie doesn't even solo on every number. Sandoval, the band's

high-note specialist, does what amounts to Gillespie's stunt work, and

Moody--whose association with Gillespie dates back to the 1940s--subs for

Gillespie in speeding through the celebrated break in "A Night in Tunisia."

Sandoval, D'Rivera, and Moreira are one-trick ponies whose lack of subtlety

works against them as leaders of their own small groups. But they sound

terrific as featured attractions in Gillespie's genial musical variety show. <p>



<p>



It's a pity that economics prevents Gillespie from touring full-time with the

United Nation Orchestra. He has always displayed all the attributes associated

with successful big-band leaders, including the often ignored one of

showmanship. At several points in his career a big band seemed like the only

format grand enough for him. It still does, if for different reasons. At this

point a big band also serves the purpose of allowing him to take a

well-deserved breather now and then.<p>

	<font size=5>J</font>OHN COLTRANE died twenty years ago, on July 17, 1967, at the age of forty. In

the years since, his influence has only grown, and the stellar avant-garde

saxophonist has become a jazz legend of a stature shared only by Louis

Armstrong and Charlie Parker. As an instrumentalist Coltrane was technically

and imaginatively equal to both; as a composer he was superior, although he has

not received the recognition he deserves for this aspect of his work. In

composition he excelled in an astonishing number of forms--blues, ballads,

spirituals, rhapsodies, elegies, suites, and free-form and cross-cultural

works.<p>



<p>



The closest contemporary analogy to Coltrane's relentless search for

possibilities was the Beatles' redefinition of rock from one album to the next.

Yet the distance they traveled from conventional hard rock through sitars and

Baroque obligatos to <I>Sergeant Pepper</I> psychedelia and the musical shards of

<I>Abbey Road</I> seems short by comparison with Coltrane's journey from hard-bop

saxist to daring harmonic and modal improviser to dying prophet speaking in

tongues.<p>



<p>



Asked by a Swedish disc jockey in 1960 if he was trying to "play what you

hear," he said that he was working off set harmonic devices while experimenting

with others of which he was not yet certain. Although he was trying to "get the

one essential . . . the one single line," he felt forced to play everything,

for he was unable to "work what I know down into a more lyrical line" that

would be "easily understood." Coltrane never found the one line. Nor was he

ever to achieve the "more beautiful . . . more lyrical" sound he aspired to. He

complicated rather than simplified his art, making it more visceral, raw, and

wild. And even to his greatest fans it was anything but easily understood. In

this failure, however, Coltrane contributed far more than he could have in

success, for above all, his legacy to his followers is the abiding sense of

search, of the musical quest as its own fulfillment.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>B</font>ORN and raised in North Carolina, Coltrane studied in Philadelphia and after

working as a clarinetist in Navy marching and dance bands in 1945-1946 he began

a decade of playing with Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson, Dizzy Gillespie, Earl

Bostic, and Johnny Hodges, and also such undistinguished rhythm-and-blues

artists as King Kolax, Bull Moose Jackson, and Daisy Mae and the Hepcats. He

came to wide notice in 1955 in the now legendary Miles Davis Quintet and was

immediately acknowledged as an original--or an oddity. Critics who in

Coltrane's last years all but waved banners to show their devotion to him were

among those casting stones for much of his career. At first many urged Davis to

fire the weird tenor, but when, in April of 1957, after a year and a half with

the quintet, Coltrane left or was dropped (the truth remains unclear), the

reason seems to have been indulgence not in stylistic extremism but in heroin

and alcohol, problems he conquered that same year. The controversy had to do

not only with his harmonic experimentation, on which Dexter Gordon was

initially the chief influence, but with the speed (to some, purely chaotic) of

his playing and the jaggedness (to some, unmusical) of his phrasing.<p>



<p>



All three characteristics were intensified in 1957 during several months with

Thelonious Monk at the Five Spot, after which he rejoined Davis, who was now

experimenting with sparer chord changes, and became fully involved in what Ira

Gitler, in <I>Down Beat</I>, called the "sheets of sound" approach. This technique of

runs so rapid as to make the notes virtually indistinguishable seems itself to

have been a by-product of Coltrane's harmonic exploration. Coltrane spoke of

playing the same chord three or four different ways within a measure or

overlapping chords before the change, advancing further the investigation of

upper harmonic intervals begun by Charlie Parker and the boppers. Attempting to

articulate so many harmonic variants before the change, Coltrane was

necessarily led to preternatural velocity and occasionally to asymmetrical

subdivision of the beat. Despite Davis's suggestion that Coltrane could trim

his twenty-seven or twenty-eight choruses if he tried taking the saxophone out

of his mouth, Coltrane's attempt "to explore all the avenues" made him the

perfect stylistic complement to Davis, with his cooler style, which featured

sustained blue notes and brief cascades of sixteenths almost willfully

retreating into silence, and also Monk, with his spare and unpredictable chords

and clusters. Davis, characteristically, paid the tersest homage, when, on

being told that his music was so complex that it required five saxophonists, he

replied that he'd once had Coltrane.<p>



<p>



Although in the late fifties Coltrane released a number of sessions for 

Prestige (and, more notably, <I>Blue Train</I> and <I>Giant Steps</I> for 

Blue Note and Atlantic respectively) in which he was the nominal 

bandleader, it was really after leaving Davis for the second time, in 1960, 

shortly after a European tour, that he came into his own as a creative as 

well as an interpretive force.  His first recording session as leader after 

the break, on October 21, 1960, produced "My Favorite Things," an 

astonishing fourteen-minute reinterpretation, or overhaul, of the 

saccharine show tune, which thrilled jazz fans with its Oriental modalism 

and Atlantic executives with its unexpected commercial success.  In it 

Coltrane revived the straight soprano sax (whose only previous master in 

jazz had been Sidney Bechet), and in so doing led a generation of young 

musicians, from Wayne Shorter to Keith Jarrett to Jon Gibson, to explore 

the instrument.  The work remained Coltrane's signature piece until his 

death (of liver disease) despite bizarre stylistic metamorphoses in the 

next five and a half years.<p>



<p>



Coltrane signed with Impulse Records in April of 1961 and the next month began

rehearsing and playing the long studio sessions for <I>Africa/Brass</I>, a large-band

experiment with arrangements by his close friend Eric Dolphy. This was in part

an extension of the modal experimentation in which he had been involved with

Davis in the late fifties, notably on the landmark <I>Kind of Blue</I>. The modal

style replaced chordal progressions as the basis for improvisation, with a

slower harmonic rhythm and patterns of intervals corresponding only vaguely to

traditional major and minor scales. The modal approach proved to be the

modulation from bop to free jazz, as is clear in Coltrane's revolutionary use

of a single mode throughout "Africa," the piece that takes up all of side one

of the album. Just as his prolonged modal solos were emulated by rock

guitarists (the Grateful Dead, the Byrds of "Eight Miles High," the unlamented

Iron Butterfly, and others), so the astonishing variety Coltrane superimposed

on that single F was, according to the composer Steve Reich, a significant, if

ostensibly an unlikely, influence on the development of minimalism. The

originator of minimalism, La Monte Young, acknowledges the influence of

Coltrane's "My Favorite Things" on his use of rapid permutations and

combinations of pitches on sopranino sax to simulate chords as sustained

tones.<p>



<p>



From the start, and especially from the opening notes of Coltrane's solo, which

bursts forth like a tribal summons, "Africa" is the aural equivalent of a

journey upriver. The elemental force of this polyrhythmic modalism was unknown

in the popular music that came before it. Coltrane experimented with two

bassists--a hint of wilder things to come, as he sought progressively to

submerge himself in rhythm. He was later to employ congas, bata, various other

Latin and African percussion instruments, and, incredibly, two

drummers--incredibly insofar as Coltrane already had, in Elvin Jones, the most

overpowering drummer in jazz. The addition of Rashied Ali to the drum corps, in

November of 1965, made for a short-lived collaboration or, rather, competition

between Jones and Ali; a disgruntled Jones left the Coltrane band in March of

1966 to join Duke Ellington's. But it was the culmination of Coltrane's search

for the rhythmic equivalent of the oceanic feeling of visionary experience.

Having employed the gifted accompanists McCoy Tyner and Jimmy Garrison during

the years of the "classic quartet" (late 1961 to mid-1965), Coltrane tended to

subordinate them, preferring that his accompanists play spare wide-interval

chords and a solid rather than showy bass, which would permit him a maximum of

flexibility as a soloist. Coltrane would often take long solos accompanied only

by his drummer, and in his penultimate recording session, which produced the

posthumous <I>Interstellar Space</I>, he is supported only by Ali. Solo sax against

drums (<I>against</I> may be all too accurate a word to describe Coltrane's concert

duets with the almost maniacal Jones) was Coltrane's conception of naked music,

the lone voice crying not in the wilderness but from some primordial chaos. His

music evokes not only the jungle but all that existed before the jungle.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<p>



<font size=5>C</font>OLTRANE'S spiritual concerns led him to a study of 

Indian music, some elements of which are present in the album 

<I>Africa/Brass</I> and more of which are in the cut from the album 

<I>Impressions</I> titled "India," which was recorded in November of 1961.  The 

same month saw the birth of "Spiritual," featuring exotic and otherworldly 

solos by Coltrane on soprano sax and Dolphy on bass clarinet.  Recorded at 

the Village Vanguard, the piece made clear, if any doubts remained, that 

Coltrane was attempting to raise jazz from the saloons to the heavens.  No 

jazzman had attempted so overtly to offer his work as a form of religious 

expression.  If Ornette Coleman was, as some have argued, the seminal 

stylistic force in sixties avant-garde jazz, Coltrane's Eastern imports 

were the main influence on the East-West "fusion" in the jazz and rock of 

the late sixties and afterward.  In his use of jazz as prayer and 

meditation Coltrane was beyond all doubt the principal spiritual force in 

music.<p>



<p>



This is further evident in "Alabama," a riveting elegy for the victims of the

infamous Sunday-morning church bombing in Birmingham in 1963. Here, as in the

early version of his most famous ballad, "Naima," Coltrane is as spare in

phrasing as he is bleak in tone. That tone, criticized by many as hard-edged

and emotionally impoverished, is inseparable from Coltrane's achievement,

conveying as it does a sense of absolute purity through the abnegation of

sentimentality. Sonny Rollins, the contemporary tenor most admired by Coltrane,

always had a richer tone, and Coltrane himself said of the mellifluous Stan

Getz, "Let's face it--we'd all sound like that if we could." Despite these

frequent and generous tributes, Coltrane's aim was different, as is clear in

his revival of the soprano sax. Rather than lushness he sought clarity and

incisiveness. As with pre-nineteenth-century string players, the rare vibrato

was dramatic ornamentation.<p>



<p>



Coltrane's religious dedication, which as much as his music made him a role

model, especially but by no means exclusively among young blacks, is clearest

of all in the album titled <I>A Love Supreme</I>, recorded in late 1964 with Tyner,

Jones, and Garrison. The album appeared in early 1965 to great popular and

critical acclaim and remains generally acknowledged as Coltrane's masterpiece.

In a sense, though, it is stylistically as much a summation as a new direction,

for its modalism and incantatory style recall "Spiritual," "India," and the

world-weary lyricism of his preceding and still underrated album, <I>Crescent</I>.

Within months Coltrane was to shift his emphasis from incantation to the

freer-form glossolalia of his last period--a transition evident in a European

concert performance of <I>A Love Supreme</I> in mid-1965.<p>



<p>



<I>Meditations</I>, recorded a year after <I>A Love Supreme</I>, is the 

finest creation of the late Coltrane, and possibly of any Coltrane.  It may 

never be as accessible as <I>A Love Supreme</I>, but it is the more 

revolutionary and compelling work.  While some of the creations of 

Coltrane's last two years are all but amorphous, <I>Meditations</I> 

succeeds not only for the transcendental force it shares with <I>A Love 

Supreme</I> but by virtue of the contrasts among the shamanistic frenzy of 

Coltrane and fellow tenor Pharoah Sanders in the opening movement "The 

Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost" and elsewhere, the sense of stoic 

resignation and perseverance in the solos of Garrison and Tyner, and the 

repeated, spiraling phrases of yearning in Coltrane's "Love" and the 

concluding "Serenity." This unity, encompassing radical stylistic and 

affective diversity, is the unique feature of <I>Meditations</I>, even in 

relation to its Ur-version for quartet, which has an additional and quite 

obtrusive movement.  Nothing that came after <I>Meditations</I> approached 

it in structural complexity and subtlety.<p>



<p>



These may be the missing ingredients in the music of Coltrane's final period.

The drummer Elvin Jones said, "Only poets can understand it," though maybe only

mystics could, for until his final album Coltrane seemingly forsook lyricism

for an unfettered quest for ecstasy. The results remain virtually

indescribable, and they forestall criticism with the furious directness of

their energy. Yet their effect depends more on the abandonment of rationality,

which most listeners achieve only intermittently if at all. In fact, it may be

the listener himself who is abandoned, for it seems clear that Coltrane is no

longer primarily concerned with a human audience. His final recording of "My

Favorite Things" and "Naima," at the Village Vanguard in 1966, uses the musical

texts as springboards to visionary rhapsody--almost, in fact, as pretexts. All

songs become virtually interchangeable, and there is really no point any longer

in requests. The only favorite thing he is playing about now is salvation.

Coltrane's second wife, Alice, who had by then replaced Tyner as the group's

pianist, has remarked, "Some of his latest works aren't musical compositions."

This may be their glory and their limitation, the latter progressively more

evident in the uninspired emulation by the so-called "Coltrane machines" who

followed the last footsteps of the master, and also in the current dismissal of

free jazz as a dead end by both jazz mainstreamers and the experimental

composer Anthony Davis (who nonetheless recently used Coltrane as a model in

the "Mecca" section of his opera <I>X</I>).<p>



<p>



The last album that Coltrane recorded was <I>Expression</I>, in February and March of

1967. The album has an aura of twilight, of limbo, particularly in the piece

"To Be," in which Coltrane and Sanders play spectral flute and piccolo

respectively. The sixteen ametrical minutes of "To Be," which could readily

have added to its title the second part of Hamlet's question, are as eerie as

any in music.<p>



<p>



The most striking characteristic of the album is its sense of consummation, 

which is clear in the abandonment of developmental structure and often bar 

divisions, and in the phantasmal rather than propulsive lines that pervade 

the work.  There had always been in Coltrane a profound tension between the 

pure virtuosity of his elongated phrases and the high sustained cries or 

eloquent rests that followed.  The cries, wails, and shrieks remain in 

<I>Expression</I> but they are subsumed by the hard-won simplicity that 

predominates in the album--the lyricism not of "the one essential" line he 

had sought seven years earlier and never found but one born of courageous 

resignation.  Pater said that all art aspires to the condition of music.  

Coltrane seems to suggest here that music in turn aspires to the condition 

of silence.<p>



<p>



Those who criticize Coltrane's virtuosic profusion are of the same party as

those who found Van Gogh's canvases "too full of paint"--a criticism Henry

Miller once compared to the dismissal of a mystic as "too full of God." In

Coltrane, sound--often discordant, chaotic, almost unbearable--became the

spiritual form of the man, an identification perhaps possible only with a wind

instrument, with which the player is of necessity fused more intimately than

with strings or percussion. This physical intimacy was all the more intense for

his characteristically tight embouchure, the preternatural duration and

complexity of his phrases, and his increasing use of overblowing techniques.

The whole spectrum of Coltrane's music--the world-weary melancholy and

transcendental yearning that ultimately recall Bach more than Parker, the

jungle calls and glossolalic shrieks, the whirlwind runs and spare elegies for

murdered children and a murderous planet--is at root merely a suffering man's

breath. The quality of that music reminds us that the root of the word

<I>inspiration</I> is "breathing upon." This country has not produced a greater

musician.<p>

	<font size=5>T</font>HE health-spa industry continues to boom. Two

decades ago there were about



twenty "destination" spas in the United States--the traditional self-contained,



full-service resorts that "spa" implies. (The word is borrowed from the name of



a Belgian resort town.) Now there are twice as many, and this growth has been



accompanied by an explosion of both high- and low-end offshoots. There are now



more than 350 upscale hotel spas, club spas, and day spas in the country. At



fancy resort hotels, in-house spa complexes that offer athletic facilities,



exercise classes, and personal services such as massage and facials have become



a must: convention bookers and well-to-do family vacationers expect them. At



the other end of the spectrum the beauty salon or health club in the local



shopping mall is likely to offer a "mini day spa," including facials, massages,



and a gourmet lunch. These are countless. And imaginative variations on the



destination spa are springing up as well--specialty spas that build the



experience around, say, mountain hikes, rafting, or yoga.



<p>



Kim Marshall, a spokesperson for the International Spa & Fitness



Association, a trade organization, explains that aging, affluent Baby Boomers,



who "won't take their own health sitting down," are at the heart of this



market. The great majority of today's spa customers are women, some of whom are



strictly devoted to their spa ritual. For example, Grace Mirabella, as the



editor of <i>Vogue</i> and then of <i>Mirabella</i>, had her annual spa visit



written into her contract. The spa industry views men as a tremendous potential



market. Ten years ago they made up eight percent of spa customers. Their share



has now risen to about 25 percent, and the industry is hopeful that still more



men can be persuaded that spas are not "fat farms for the wealthy," as Marshall



puts it, but a smart way to keep stress low, muscle tone high, and creative



energy on edge.<p>



	



	I've recently spent time, courtesy of the owners, at four premier health spas:



the Golden Door, near San Diego; Rancho La Puerta, just across the border in



Tecate, Mexico; and the two Canyon Ranch spas, in Tucson, Arizona, and in the



Berkshires, in Massachusetts. Besides returning home "buffed and polished," as



my family described me, I learned some things that may help you explore the



possibility of your own spa vacation.



 <P>



<font size=5>T</font>HERE was a sameness to the patterns of daily life at

these health spas,



involving hard physical exercise, mental rest, spiritual renewal, and healthful



eating. The Golden Door excels at fine-tuning a personal daily plan for each



guest. At the initial interview I had indicated that I was interested in tough



exercise, and my schedule looked like this: Mornings began at dawn with a brisk



hike through secluded hills. Breakfast appeared in my cottage while I showered



and changed. By eight o'clock I was at my favorite class, an hour of tai chi.



The hard work and play continued throughout the day: hour-long classes of floor



aerobics or circuit training or weight workouts or swimming, alternating with



luxurious choices from the "beauty menu," such as an aromatherapy face-and-neck



treatment and a Moortherapy body treatment (it's mud from Austria).



<p>



At the end



of each afternoon, after a few minutes in the eucalyptus steam room, I fell



onto the table for my deep massage, which was accompanied by New Age music and



cooing doves. Any evening energy--and there wasn't much--was spent on a movie



or a lecture. The day was capped off with another, brief massage before bed.



Entering the Golden Door was as good for my spirit as for my body; I felt like



Jane Wyatt entering Shangri-la in the 1937 film <i>Lost Horizon</i>. There was



an aura of tranquillity and serenity and isolation from the world's turmoil.



With only thirty-nine guests each week, the 120-member staff could anticipate



our every need (fresh exercise clothes delivered daily) and indulge our every



whim (would you like your massage in the bathhouse, or perhaps in your room, or



even outdoors?).



<p>



The Golden Door is where practice has made perfect. The site of the practice is



its older-sister spa, Rancho La Puerta, in Mexico. "The Ranch" opened in 1940



as a humble cooperative health camp. In the start-up years guests contributed



$17.50 a week and their own labor chopping firewood and tending goats, crops,



and the camp vineyard in exchange for the opportunity to hike in the mountains



and swim in the river, eat healthful vegetarian meals, and--the main



draw--listen to daily lectures by the camp's founder, Edmond Szekely. Szekely



was a Hungarian scholar and philosopher who preached the value of a simple,



caring, healthy life based on principles he had extracted from the study of the



Dead Sea colony's ancient Essene sect.



<p>



By now, of course, much has changed. Edmond Szekely is dead. Deborah Szekely,



who was there in the beginning as his seventeen-year-old child bride, and the



couple's children carry on the spirit, but they have moved Rancho La Puerta



into the 1990s, in which it is a unique, transcending, offbeat experience.



Normally tough customers such as New York literary agents and Washington



lawyers use the word "magical" to describe it. The meals remain vegetarian,



almost all still straight from the ranch's gardens. The accommodations are



comfortable but simple, with handmade signs requesting that you conserve water.



A philosophy of the interdependence of mind, body, and spirit sets the tone for



many activities: guests commonly rise before dawn to practice yoga by firelight



in a gym with a beamed ceiling. At sunset another gym fills for the popular



Inner Journey class, in which guests explore private problems or thoughts or



just drift along to the rhythms of chants and temple bells.<p>







If the Golden Door and Rancho La Puerta are, respectively, the Rolls-Royce and



the Hummer of the spa world, then Canyon Ranch in Tucson and its sister spa in



the Berkshires are the sleek and polished Jaguars. In 1978 Mel Zuckerman, who



was then an overweight, overwrought real-estate developer, spent four weeks at



a California health spa, where he lost twenty-nine pounds and had what he calls



a "transformative experience." Zuckerman saw "how empowered people were to be



healthy," and this spurred him to set out with his wife, Enid, to realize their



version of the spa dream.<p>







Eighteen months later they opened <A

HREF="http://www.lexicom.ab.ca/~resort2fitness/canarz.htm"> Canyon Ranch



</A> in Tucson, which today is a shimmering seventy-acre spread--a

community of good will, plenitude, and



energy. There are nine gyms, eight tennis courts, assorted volleyball,



racquetball, squash, and basketball courts, and four swimming pools, including



one with a state-of-the-art underwater treadmill. A sun-never-sets tone drives



the day: five different morning walks depart at 7:00 A.M., and thereafter



guests may choose among forty exercise classes, guided hikes and bike rides in



the Santa Catalina foothills, and evening programs from hobby classes to



lectures to astrology sessions.<p>







I spent a breathless day or two trying to do everything--a mistake made by many



neophyte spa-goers--before I slowed down and made choices. I browsed the



fifty-three-page guide to services, therapies, and treatments (including those



offered at the impressive full-scale medical facility that sets Canyon Ranch



apart from every other spa I know of). In Tucson or in the Berkshires I tried



acupuncture, reflexology, biofeedback, a seaweed treatment, and a posture



alignment, and I had a bone-density evaluation. Having approached some of these



a bit skeptically, I was consistently impressed with the staff's



professionalism and the first-rate service it provided. The whole experience



was also a lot of fun.<p>







<A HREF="http://www.romresorts.com/canyon.html">Canyon Ranch in the



Berkshires </A>, the Zuckermans' second spa, which opened in



1989, was built around a restored turn-of-the-century thirty-five-room mansion



in Lenox, Massachusetts--a town once considered the Newport of the hills for



East Coast millionaires. This Canyon Ranch has adapted to the East Coast nicely



as a more sedate, New England version of the original, with an elegant



country-French formal dining room and a firelit high-ceilinged library. And it



makes the most of the seasonal offerings of its neighborhood, sending guests to



Tanglewood on summer evenings or cross-country or downhill skiing in the

winter.



<p>



<font size=5>I </font> <font size=3> LEARNED </font>



some valuable lessons from my spa stays. Most important, spa-goers must know



what they're after. People generally go to health spas for some combination of



these three reasons: to get in shape, to be pampered, to deal with a problem



such as stress or overweight or grief. Since spas have different strengths and



emphases, you'll feel happy or dissatisfied with your stay according to whether



you choose a spa well suited to your needs.











The publication <i>The Spa Finder</i>, produced by the country's largest



spa-specialty travel company, <A

HREF="http://www.spafinders.com">Spa-Finders </A> (call 800-255-7727 or, in

New York,



212-924-6800 to order a $5.95 catalogue), or a good guidebook such as <A



HREF="http://www.fodors.com"> Fodor's </A><i>Healthy Escapes</i> helps you

search by categorizing spas according to



specialty, such as luxury pampering, preventive medicine, sports conditioning,



nutrition and diet, or spiritual awareness. Once you're in the right field, you



can shorten your list according to location, cost, size, and so on. You can



also try reading between the lines to get a sense of atmosphere, although I've



found that to be a lesser substitute for talking to friends or acquaintances



who know a spa firsthand.<p>







Other things to bear in mind:<p>







Do you want a stay of just a few days, or can you spare a week? This choice



matters particularly because some spas have prescribed schedules, whereas



others let you create your own. It seemed to me that one key to the harmony of



the Golden Door and Rancho La Puerta is that all the guests arrive together and



depart together, and they can be paced through a full week--unwinding and



mellowing--in unison.<p>







At the Golden Door, I felt the world slipping away day by day. On Monday, I was



my usual hyperorganized self, trotting from class to class toting schedule and



gym bag. By Wednesday, very relaxed, I could barely keep track of my locker



key. On Thursday it seemed a wholly appropriate question when, at the



conclusion of a silk-mitted total-body scrub, the young attendant, who was



holding up a fluffy, warmed towel, asked, "Shall I dry you?"<p>







The sense of harmony is diminished when guests check in daily, bringing their



fresh tensions from the outside world. And it is nonexistent at spas within



large hotels, where your fellow guests may be conventioneers whooping it up at



night after long days in meetings. They won't be in the same frame of mind as



you are.<p>







Since spa vacations aren't cheap, look closely at the packages and plans



offered by spas that interest you. The Golden Door (800-424-0777) charges a



hefty fee: $4,375 for the week, or $3,875 in summer. But this covers



everything: daily massages, wraps in herb-soaked linens, body scrubs, facials,



and more, which could raise your cost well above this fee if you were ordering



a la carte elsewhere. In addition you're buying the pleasure of avoiding



decisions and forgetting about money (do Iwant to spend another $55 today for



another massage?). At Rancho La Puerta (800-443-7565) fees range from $1,485 to



$2,330 for the week, with beauty treatments and massages extra.<p>







The Canyon Ranches (800-726-9900 for information on both) offer many options.



In Tucson, for example, there are packages ranging from a four-night off-season



stay (about $1,300, plus an 18 percent service charge) to a ten-night



high-season stay in luxury accommodations ($5,740, plus service). Each package



includes a number of services, and more may be added--for example, an herbal



wrap, the exotic Parisian body scrub, a complete physical, or even a night of



sleep-apnea monitoring.<p>







Spas have personalities, just as regions and neighborhoods do. Staff members at



Canyon Ranch say that guests who have been to both their campuses tend to like



one style or the other. For me, relaxation and renewal mean the hot climates of



the dry Southwest or the humid tropics. Others prefer tall oaks to tumbleweed,



and live by the change of seasons.<p>







Similarly, the setting of the spa matters. Rancho La Puerta is so far from



civilization that you are likely to be able to watch a meteor shower against



the black sky from your terrace at 3:00 A.M., as I did. But, to be fair, if you



enjoy this side of the spa's rusticity, you shouldn't object when the soap



won't lather or your feet are cold on the tile floors.<p>







At Canyon Ranch in Tucson you'll see the light of the city's suburban sprawl,



but you can also plug into the pulse of the nation with TVs, radios, and



newspapers, and stock your room fridge with beer from a nearby shopping mall.



The accommodations are luxurious; the cottage I stayed in was more comfortably



equipped and appointed than the house where my entire family of four lived for



a year in Yokohama.<p>







Your fellow spa-goers will also affect your experience. Here those worried



comments your children may have made should resonate with you: "Who will share



my cabin at summer camp?" "Do you think I'll like my college roommate?" Of



course, you don't need to share your accommodations, but you will share a spa



experience with the other guests more intimately than you would share most



other vacations. Mealtimes tend to be social occasions; people get to know one



another during hikes and walks; faces become familiar at exercise classes. You



may not be able to do anything about it, but be prepared for it.<p>







The Golden Door meets the gender gap among spa patrons head on: thirty-nine



weeks of the year are for women only, five are for men, and the rest are co-ed.



I didn't do a head count at Rancho La Puerta, but women predominated, and the



men looked like they were having a great time. At Canyon Ranch in Tucson there



were lots of couples. In the Berkshires it was a strongly feminine week. The



few men in attendance seemed to be just following their wives around. Whether



the balance of the sexes matters to you is worth thinking about.<p>







Now, here's a lesson that spas try to teach: find something to "take home with



you." They don't mean a T-shirt or a recipe for salsa. I've been surprised that



many months later, long after the mellow vacation feelings have dissipated, I



can recall something about my spa stays--the way the light looked behind a



mountain, or how I felt doing tai chi--that will bring back a moment of magic I



found.<p>

It is encouraging to see aLatin American intellectual confront culture as a central factor in explainingthe vast gap in human well-being that separates Canada and the United Statesfrom Latin America. One wonders how much that gap might have been narrowed hadLatin American intellectuals --Casta&ntilde;eda prominent among them--and U.S.intellectuals not spent the past several decades contriving specious theoriesthat blamed Latin America's ills on the United States.<p>Casta&ntilde;eda's plea to keep our border open to Mexican immigrantsunderscores the points he makes about Mexico's failures as a society. Try toimagine conditions in Mexico today with an additional 10 million people (morethan a tenth of Mexico's current population), the vast majority with littleeducation and few skills. That's the estimate of the demographer Leon Bouvier,of the Center for Immigration Studies, of the Mexicans who have immigratedlegally and illegally into the United States since 1960, plus theiroffspring.<p>But in advocating immigration to the United States as a pressure valve forMexico, Casta&ntilde;eda ignores the negative consequences of this enormoussouth-north flow for the United States, and above all for its own poorcitizens, mostly black and Hispanic. Growing income disparity within the UnitedStates is not the result only of Reagan policies. Another contributor is thevast pool of unskilled immigrants (Mexico being the largest source of them)that has flooded our labor market, displacing poor citizens and driving wagesand benefits down. Immigrants also compete with poor citizens for socialservices.<p>Immigration is thus relevant to "The Crisis of Public Order," Adam Walinsky'scompelling article in the same issue. Immigration both aggravates the povertythat nurtures violent crime and diverts resources from programs to do somethingabout it. And there is at least some evidence, which Walinsky's data do notaddress, of a disproportionate Hispanic (principally of Mexican origin)involvement in crime--for example, in Colorado, where in 1988 Hispanicsaccounted for 11 percent of the population and 25 percent of the prisonpopulation.<p><strong>Lawrence E. Harrison</strong><br><em>Cambridge, Mass.</em><p><br><br><br>Jorge Casta&ntilde;eda's description of the economically polarized Mexicansociety and its "informal" relationship to work, life, and love does help toexplain the poverty and high birth rate of its underclass but in no way makes areasonable case for addressing the ill consequences of this problem by shuntingthe unwanted masses onto the United States, as he attempts to do in his closingparagraph.<p>It is clear that the United States, acting as a safety valve for Mexico'sunwanted, unsatisfied peoples and as a source of hope to all, has merely aidedthe Mexican ruling class in maintaining an exclusive grip on the nation'swealth. The unsatisfied can simply emigrate and send part of their paycheckhome.<p>Apparently, what Mexico really needs is an outright revolution with a fewruling-class heads on the pikes to initiate change. This would be far morepalatable to many in the United States than the social revolution we willexperience at home if the gradual Mexican invasion of illegal immigration isallowed to continue.<p><strong>Mark Fickes</strong><br><em>Maple Grove, Minn.</em><p><br><br><br>Jorge Casta&ntilde;eda's main suggestion gave me pause, and I had to read itover several times to be certain I was not misinterpreting the author's advice.For Casta&ntilde;eda recommends that the United States allow huge waves ofillegal Mexican aliens into the country in order to forestall a revolution inMexico. He shows no concern at all with the impact on the U.S. labor market,school systems, or criminal-justice system (18 percent of prisoners inCalifornia are illegals).<p>Is Casta&ntilde;eda, who does not tell us which of Mexico's three racialgroupings he belongs to, seeking to have the United States ally with a smallracist group of millionaires and their assassination teams? I vote for aMexican revolution. It may solve the immigrant problem in California, becausemany of <i>la raza</i>'s militants could return to their homeland and fight forjustice in a land in which Mexicans are genuinely oppressed (Mexico), insteadof asking for special privileges in a tolerant country that unwisely admittedthem (the United States).<p><strong>Kenneth Barkin</strong><br><em>Riverside, Calif.</em><p><br><br><br><p><em>Jorge Casta&ntilde;eda replies:</em><p><i></i>Mexico's current economic crisis is mentioned in the essay as an exampleof a much more atemporal and substantive problem: why Americans do notunderstand Mexico. Using the surprising--for many--nature of the crisis as anexample, Itry to explain why Mexico retains an undeniable opacity for observersfrom abroad. I argue that it stems from the differences between Mexico and theUnited States, which stretch beyond levels of income and productivity and reachinto the deeper realms of the soul, history, and society. No attempt is made toestablish a causal relationship between Mexico's ills--economic, social, orotherwise--and those ferocious differences. <p>After examining some of the differences I consider paramount, I conclude withanother example--of an upcoming surprise that should not be one. Mexicaneconomic, social, and political stability will be seriously affected ifemigration to the United States is curtailed at a particularly difficult timefor millions of Mexicans. Again, this is simply an example, not a causalrelationship or a policy recommendation. I do not know, and certainly do notpresume to discover in a short essay, whether Mexico's ills can be or have beensolved--or aggravated, as the case may be--by immigration; I certainly do notstate that immigration is the answer, nor do I recommend "that the UnitedStates allow huge waves of illegal Mexican aliens into the country in order toforestall a revolution in Mexico" (though this is partly what the United Stateshas done for half a century, rightly or wrongly). I only want to suggest, inpassing, that Americans should proceed today on the question of immigrationwith their eyes open. Among the many factors that U.S. immigration policyshould take into account is the effect on Mexico. After fully considering whatimpact a given immigration reform could have on its neighbor, the United Statesmay decide to act regardless of that impact. And that impact may occurregardless of whether the United States takes it into account. <p><br><br><br><p><A NAME="dam problems"><H3>Dam Problems</H3></A><font size=5>I</font><font size=3>n "The Trouble With Dams" (August <i>Atlantic</i>), Robert S. Devine lamentsthe waste in pumping 43 million gallons of water to get a single pleasure boatthrough a lock: "water that could have helped dying salmon survive, or couldhave generated enough electricity (about $700 worth) to supply an average housein the Northwest for one year." Devine seemingly thinks that after water ispumped up to the lock's top level, it proceeds directly to the earth's core.But the next time the lock is lowered, that 43 million gallons of water will bereturned to the lower level, as available for fish habitat, power generation,and other downstream uses as it ever was. (If the lock in question routes itsdownflows through a hydroelectric generator, that 43-million-gallon parcel ofwater will actually generate more electricity than if the lock had nevercaptured it.)<p>Locking a single pleasure craft through a huge lock <i>is </i>wasteful, butonly in the amount of energy consumed to pump the water uphill, less any energygenerated when that parcel of water is returned. To the degree that Devine bidsus squander our energies in mourning mythical dead salmon and darkened homes,he compromises the credibility of the rest of his article--and reduces thelikelihood that the waste he decries will be addressed in less sensational,more effective ways.<p><strong>Thomas W. Flynn</strong><br><em>Buffalo, N.Y.</em><p><br><br><br>I have just read "The Trouble With Dams," and I am disappointed. The articleconcentrates on subsidy costs and wildlife impact, and as a result issuperficially impressive. But that's all. One gets the impression that foodsupply, low-cost bulk transportation with minimal air-quality impact, andcivilization itself are less important than wetlands and the fauna and florathey augment.<p>I really get tired of hearing that big banks, big insurance companies, and bigbusiness are the bad people of our society, and not the guardians of oursavings, our insurance reserves, and our food supply. There are many obviousabuses of the subsidies, and I wouldn't pay a dime for flood damage to peoplewho knowingly live in a floodplain (but that <i>was </i>a surprise to manyhonest people in 1993).<p>But the scale of the abuses in the use of food stamps and the endless array ofwelfare benefits are wrong too. Nevertheless, people have to be fed, housed,and clothed, and their children educated, no matter what. At least the cost ofwater supply and control has been somewhat quantified, and the costs mentionedare but a dot on our annual expenditures, whereas the philosophy of naturefirst, man second is an old philosophy almost from the beginning of recordedhistory, and is unquantified and an emotional reaction today.<p><strong>Wilfred P. Juckem</strong><br><em>Davenport, Iowa</em><p><br><br><br> "The Trouble With Dams" probably left many readers perplexed, wondering whythey had not heard previously about the deleterious effects of dams on ournation's rivers and their own wallets. In a concise, uncompromising fashion,Devine reveals that the "federal" dams--those built and operated by the ArmyCorps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, ostensibly for flood controland irrigation respectively--have lined the pockets of powerful economicinterests at the expense of fish, wildlife, and the American public.<p>The megalithic federal "public works" dams showcased by Devine are, however,only part of the problem. America's rivers and streams are also obstructed bythousands of nonfederal dams that have been and continue to be constructedprimarily for hydroelectric power, owing in large part to federal legislationenacted in the late 1970s to hedge against the vagaries of the world oilmarket. These dams have contributed greatly to the precipitous ecologicaldecline of many U.S. rivers, and environmental degradation is particularlyprofound in river systems with multiple hydroelectric dams.<p>Under federal law the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency thatregulates the construction and operation of nonfederal dams, cannot license theconstruction of a new dam or relicense existing dams unless, after giving equalconsideration to power values and to environmental quality, it determines thatto do so will be in the public interest. Unfortunately, the FERC continues toapprove new dam construction in degraded river basins and appears poised tobegin relicensing existing projects without due regard for river health oradequate protection and mitigation for fish and wildlife. Until the FERC takesits legal charge seriously, the deplorable state of many American rivers willpersist.<p><strong>Rob Masonis</strong><br><em>Seattle, Wash.</em><p><br><br><br> "The Trouble With Dams" obviously was never intended to balance the manybenefits of dams with the problems they pose. Suffice it to say that yourreaders got only one side of the story.<p>The article, however, was totally off base on the prices that irrigators inWestlands Water District pay for water from the federal Central Valley Project,in California. In reality they pay from $34.00 to $45.00 per acre foot, eventhough the federal government originally contracted to deliver water for$8.00.<p>The prices have been substantially increased by legislation passed by Congressin 1982 and 1992. For example, the prices failed to include the $6.35 per acrefoot paid into an environmental-restoration fund by CVP contractors. It isindeed true that Westlands' farmers pay more than most for their water.<p>The author also used an apples-and-oranges comparison: for Westlands he usedthe range of basic prices paid by the district to the federal government,rather than the cost delivered to the farms. For avocado growers in San Diego,however, he used the delivered price.<p>Comparing prices paid by farmers with those paid by cities is anotherapples-and-oranges situation. Water prices are driven by four major factors:how far the water must travel, how high it has to be pumped, whether the watermust be treated for human consumption, and the expense of distributing thewater.<p>Farmers generally (the San Diego avocado grower is one exception) are close tothe source, don't have to pump their water over high mountains, don't have totreat their water, and have low distribution costs. Water from northernCalifornia must be conveyed more than 400 miles, pumped more than 3,000 feetuphill, and delivered through a very expensive urban-type system in order toreach the San Diego avocado grower. That's why it costs $300-$400 an acre foot;water from the same project (California's State Water Project) is currentlydelivered in the San Joaquin Valley, adjacent to Westlands, for $47.00 an acrefoot.<p>David Yardas, of the Environmental Defense Fund, was correct in saying thatmost farmers can afford the state-project water. He was dead wrong on twocounts: Westlands and other CVP contractors pay much more than he said; and heneglected to mention that full cost in the federal project is much higher thanthe state-<br>project rate. The current CVP full-cost rate of $75.00-$94.00 anacre foot is unaffordable for growers of most crops. The huge difference inwater cost is due to an arbitrary interest-rate formula, written into the 1982legislation, that is much higher than the state-project interest rate.<p>The article also repeated a common misconception about cotton, calling it aplant that "guzzles" more than thirty inches of water a year. Waterrequirements for cotton are more accurately described as moderate. Cotton usesabout the same amount as grapevines, but a third less than fruit or nut treesand other field crops grown in the area. Cotton requires less than half as muchwater as alfalfa or irrigated pasture (or, for that matter, many lawns, parks,and golf courses).<p>Farmers in Westlands are switching to vegetable crops, including tomatoes,garlic, onions, and lettuce, as rapidly as the markets for these commoditiesexpand. Since 1980 vegetable acreage in Westlands has increased from 70,000 to180,000 acres. The major reason is economics; these crops provide a higherreturn than the crops they replace. As a group the vegetables also use aboutsix inches less water than cotton.<p>Cotton acreage, on the other hand, has remained static or declined slightly.This trend demonstrates clearly that somewhat lower water prices and theexistence of a commodity program don't encourage farmers to grow, much less"lavish" water on, cotton or any other crop. Farmers fully realize that wateris too scarce to waste. Many of them choose the crops they grow on the basis ofnet income per acre foot of water.<p>For the record, Westlands does not have leaky canals. Water is distributedthrough underground pipelines and metered at each delivery point. More thanhalf the acreage is irrigated by sprinklers, and almost all the permanent cropshave drip or micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. Several farmers conductfield-scale trials in an effort to find a cost-effective way to use expensivesubsurface drip irrigation on annual field crops--another way to get the mostout of every drop of water.<p><strong>David Orth</strong><br><em>General Manager<br>Westlands Water District<br>Fresno, Calif.</em><p><br><br><br>In addition to the ecological impact that all kinds of dams have, outlined byRobert Devine, the thousands of hydropower dams nationwide cause their ownunique kind of damage to the aquatic environment. For example, hydropower damsdivert water away from the river for power generation. Stretches of riverbetween the dam (where the water is diverted from the river) and the powerhousedownstream (where the water is spun through turbines and released back into theriver) are often totally devoid of water, destroying the continuity of theriver as a migration corridor for plants and animals.<p>Many hydropower dams also store the river's flow in their reservoir and thenrelease the water for power generation at times of peak electricity need. Thisis called peaking-power operation, which produces much costlier electricitythan regular operations. Peaking power causes both the reservoir created by thedam and downstream stretches of river to fluctuate between low and high water,degrading shorelines and disturbing fisheries, waterfowl, and bottom-dwellingorganisms, especially during nesting or spawning periods. Irregular releases ofwater by a peaking-power dam also destroy the river's natural seasonal flowvariations, which trigger growth and reproduction cycles in many species.<p>In addition, the flow of water into a hydropower dam's turbines draws fish intothe spinning blades. The fish are often killed by the turbines. Those thatsurvive are often injured or stunned, making them easy prey below the dam forflying predators such as gulls and herons. Thus the area below a dam isnicknamed "chowder alley." <p>Fortunately, the means are at hand to reduce the environmental damage caused bymany of the nation's hydropower dams. In the next fifteen years the operatinglicenses will expire on more than 500 nonfederal hydropower dams (owned byprivate developers, utilities, municipalities, and others). The relicensing ofthese dams is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which cancondition the relicensing of these dams on improvements to reduce environmentaldamage. Because hydropower-dam licenses last thirty to fifty years, this istruly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change how the nation's hydropowerdams are managed.<p><strong>Margaret Bowman</strong><br><em>Director of Hydropower Programs American Rivers<br>Washington, D.C.</em><p><br><br><br>As Robert Devine observes in his generally perceptive article, "Sometimes, insome places, some kinds of dams will make sense." It is unfortunate that he didnot heed his own conclusion when he decided to lump all inland-waterwaytransportation in his criticism of indiscriminate damming of America'srivers.<p>Few Americans perceive how critical the nation's inland waterways are to ourcommerce. Well over 1.1 billion tons of bulk commodities will move over ournation's rivers in 1995, primarily the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and theirtributaries. Coal from West Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania can move toelectric-power plants, chemicals and a variety of petroleum products aredelivered from refineries to wholesale and retail distributors, and grain fromfarms is shipped to millers and processors. In each case these commodities movewith greater safety, less pollution, greater efficiency per unit of energyconsumed to move each ton, and at less cost than they would by competing modesof transportation. Even with taxpayer support the inland waterways bringeconomic benefits to everyone in the form of cheaper electricity and lowerprices on finished goods.<p>Pointing out the $1.5 billion authorized by Congress for capital improvementson the Ohio River system over the past ten years is particularly misleading.Virtually all these lock and dam projects have replaced or will replaceexisting facilities that are decades old. Moreover, shippers pay to the InlandWaterways Trust Fund an excise of twenty cents per gallon of fuel used inbarging operations. This excise supports 50 percent of the cost of studies andcapital improvements to the locks and dams and related infrastructure.<p><strong>Steven F. Leer</strong><br><em>Inland Waterways Users Board<br>St. Louis, Mo.</em><p><br><br><br>The trouble with "The Trouble With Dams" is its clear view against waterprojects. Robert Devine claims that public funding of water projects,particularly in the West, has had little benefit. Nothing could be much fartherdownstream from the truth.<p>A cursory glance at the history of the U.S. West reveals a struggle betweensupply and demand. With a large influx of easterners before the turn of thecentury and after the Great Depression, common sense demanded the meansnecessary to survive.<p>An example is the federal Central Valley Project, built under FranklinRoosevelt's authority in the 1930s. Prior to the development of the project,California land was largely barren. Under the CVP, however, a wide variety ofcrops was produced, providing economic sustenance and stability. It is aperversion of the truth to state that dams "impoverish" citizens. In fact,those within the CVP and other federal projects welcomed the chance to "makeit." Dams change the ecosystem--but for the benefit, not to the detriment, oftaxpayers.<p>Flood control is another area in which focusing on hard costs makes littlesense. Population growth, much as we are loath to admit it, has interfered inthe marketplace. Devine recognizes this fact but ignores its effects. Hesuggests building in areas outside floodplains--but it is not that simple.Areas outside floodplains are often already developed or protected, limitingresidence choices. Perhaps cessation of building altogether is the unstatedsolution--a novel idea, but one with little practicality. Until our economy canbe sustained without depending on growth, building is the unfortunatereality.<p>Most disturbing is Devine's evaluation of agricultural water practices. Thewide variance in water costs between cities and agriculture apparently bearsexplanation yet again. Municipal and industrial water prices are (comparably)higher for several reasons: filtration and disinfecting facilities, watermeters, underground pipe, and in California extensive transportationfacilities. The water that farmers receive is untreated and unsuitable forhuman consumption--"raw" and less reliable, because city and environmentalwater uses have priority in times of shortage.<p>Yet an image of wasteful water practices by agriculture has long beencultivated, particularly by David Yardas, of the Environmental Defense Fund,and by other environmental groups. Even at a cost of less than $20.00 per acrefoot, farmers would be shooting themselves in the proverbial foot by wastingwater--in essence, only costing themselves more money. There is also thequestion of why agriculture would use up a necessary yet limited resource soquickly.<p>Devine states that "a great deal of water vanishes from fields. . . .surrendering a huge volume of water to evaporation and seepage." Groundwateraquifers in California can be drawn down and recharged. Once water is in theground, minimal loss occurs, making unlined canals a component of groundwaterrecharge. Lining canals, using low-flow systems, and making other costlyimprovements do mean that less water is used--but less water is storedunderground.<p>In the past decade California agriculture has invested some $300 millionannually in micro, drip, and other advanced irrigation methods, negatingDevine's assumption that farmers "still rely on inefficient" methods.Considering that most irrigation improvements have come in the past ten years,relying on studies from the 1970s hardly seems accurate or fair.<p>Is there some waste? Unfortunately, yes, but simply jacking up the price ofwater will solve only a portion of the problem. Working through programs (likethose of the California Department of Water Resources) to educate farmers toalternatives is far more efficient and effective.<p>The diversity of fruits, nuts, and vegetables that are grown in California as aresult of the Central Valley Project has benefited the nation. Even cotton, theundeserving poster child of crop-choice critics, is virtually never in surplusand contributes significantly to the national trade balance. All of thisbounty, using only 30 percent of the developed water supply, leads one toconclude that a wise investment was made in building water projects.<p><strong>R. Brad Shinn</strong><br><em>California Farm Water Coalition<br>Sacramento, Calif.</em><br><br><br><br><p><em>Robert S. Devine replies:</em><p>Thomas Flynn is misinformed about lock operations at Lower Granite Dam. Thelock draws its water from the upper reservoir. When a boat headed downriver islowered, or the water level is lowered to accept a boat going upriver, that 43million gallons, otherwise unused, drains into the downriver reservoir. Lockswaste significant amounts of water; during drought years the Army Corps ofEngineers restricts lockages in an effort to conserve.<p>Wilfred Juckem correctly notes that the many benefits that dams provide werenot the subject of my article. However, in many cases the benefits aren'tnearly as great as advertised. When one also considers subsidies, industrieshurt by dams (such as commercial fishing), and environmental harm, many damsdon't appear to provide net benefits to society. I appreciate that Juckem istired of the phrases "big banks," "big insurance companies," and "bigbusiness"; I hope he appreciates that I didn't add to his burden by using anyof those phrases in my article. Juckem also refers to the costs of dams anddam-related subsidies as "but a dot on our annual expenditures." Well, toparaphrase the late Senator Everett Dirksen, a billion here and a billionthere, and pretty soon you're talking about real money.<p>Steven Leer makes it sound as if barging is clean and green because it pollutesless and uses proportionately less energy than do competing means of shippingbulk commodities. But dredging, the disruption of natural river flows, andother measures that serve shipping cause extensive environmental harm. Leeralso states that barging deserves taxpayer support because it's cheaper thancompeting modes of transportation--but in many cases it's cheaper preciselybecause taxpayers support it. He justifies the $1.5 billion that Congress hasdoled out to the Ohio River system for upgrading its locks and dams on thegrounds that the existing facilities are decades old. Perhaps their age makesrehabilitation necessary, but their age hardly justifies the use of taxpayerdollars, especially considering that federal money built those locks and damsfor bargers in the first place. Leer closes by pointing out that shippers pay afuel tax that covers 50 percent of capital improvements to waterways. Such atax was imposed in the 1980s (over the fierce objections of bargers), butloopholes greatly reduce the amount shippers pay; in fiscal year 1995 the fueltax covered only 23 percent of capital improvements. Leer forgets to mentionthat the federal government pays 100 percent of the annual operation-and-maintenance budget for inland waterways, an amount that usually exceeds themoney spent on capital improvements.<p>Brad Shinn writes that I pervert the truth when I state that dams "impoverish"citizens. No such statement appears in my article. But dams do inflict economicharm on many citizens, such as farmers whose fields are encrusted with saltowing to upriver irrigation practices, persons displaced by reservoirs, andthose whose livelihoods depend on fish populations that have been devastated bywater projects. Shinn grossly overstates the case when he declares that we mustdevelop floodplains because builders have nowhere else to go; usually otherland is available. His assertion that before the coming of industrialagriculture the Central Valley, in California, was "largely barren" reveals anarrow utilitarian perspective. The pre-Columbian Central Valley was agrassland of immense biological wealth, home to clouds of waterfowl, salmon,and even tremendous grizzlies and wolves.<p>Shinn's argument that farmers cost themselves money if they waste water isspecious; some irrigators receive water that is so heavily subsidized that it'scheaper to use it profligately than to pay for improvements that conserve it.Shinn says I'm way off the mark in stating that the U.S. Department ofAgriculture almost always declares cotton a surplus crop; the USDA says I'mright. Shinn writes that California irrigators use only 30 percent of thedeveloped water supply; a variety of authoritative sources put the figure atabout 80 percent.<p>Shinn and David Orth rightly challenge my unintended implication that farmersshould be paying the same price for raw water that others pay for treated andarduously delivered water. However, I stand by the pivotal comparison thatreveals a large part of the subsidy that irrigators enjoy: the Westlands WaterDistrict pays only $8.00-$31.00 per acre foot (not $34.00-$45.00, as Orthstates) for Bureau of Reclamation water, although it costs the bureau$61.00-$80.00 to make that water available. Orth's figures are inaccurate inpart because he includes the $6.35 per acre foot that gets paid into theenvironmental-restoration fund. That $6.35 pays (or barely begins to pay) forthe environmental degradation caused by irrigation, not for water per se. Orthdefends using more than thirty inches of water a year to grow cotton in adesert by observing that some Westlands growers raise crops that require evenmore water. I'm glad he's not my attorney.<p>Finally, several of the respondents employ a peculiar bit of reasoning oftenused by the benefactors of dam-related subsidies; they boast of the economicgood created by the taxpayer money that has allowed them to prosper. But asthey're now so prosperous, why should the government continue to subsidizethem? Should we also give entrepreneurial seed money to Microsoft? Instead ofasking for more, these fortunate businesses should thank the taxpayers forgiving them a great start and begin making it on their own.<p><br><br><br><p><A NAME="structure of success"><H3>Structure of Success</H3></A><font size=5>I </font> <font size=3>found "The Structure of Success in America," by Nicholas Lemann (August<i>Atlantic</i>), to be an extremely interesting history of an institution ofwhich I previously knew nothing but which I have dutifully served in my studentcareer. I am entering my second year of graduate school at Columbia University;thus I have taken, and paid for, almost every test issued by ETS, including thePSAT, two SATs, achievement tests, advanced-placement tests, and the GRE. Whilereading your article I was struck by two thoughts. First, that I have harboredresentment toward ETS since my high school days, because it has tried toquantify me in order to determine where I fit academically among my peers andhas corroded the ideal of learning for learning's sake. Ultimately ETS has madesome of my life decisions for me, and has made reality what Carl Brighampredicted: "the inevitable distortion of education in terms of tests."<p>My second thought is that ETS is based on a dead philosophy, a casualty of theSecond World War, which holds that meaningfulness and usefulness can be chartedand graphed and numbered and analyzed. Why does the American university find ittoo difficult to rid itself of false idols: logical positivism and ETS?<p><strong>Sergia Nasby</strong><br><em>New York, N.Y.</em><p><br><br><br><p>Nicholas Lemann's fascinating review of the history of academic aptitudetesting left out one significant factor: high school rank (HSR). Aptitude-testscores when combined with HSRpredict better than HSR alone in the liberal arts,but are not as helpful in predicting success in engineering schools asperformance on a mathematics test combined with HSR.<p><strong>Ray H. Bixler</strong><br><em>Jeffersontown, Ky.</em><p><br><br><br><em>Nicholas Lemann replies:</em><p><i></i>Ray Bixler overstates high school rank's lead in the predictivenessrace. Yes, it's generally more predictive of college grades than the SAT, butnot always or by a huge margin.<p><p><br><br><br><p><strong>Editors' Note:</strong><p>We were saddened to learn that Daniel Cohen died, of AIDS, last summer. In hisoccasional reports for us from Paris, a city he had lived in as a student andvisited often, Cohen gracefully and concisely incorporated impressive amountsof information--a skill apparent to the readers of <i>Smithsonian</i>, to whichhe contributed often. Cohen was memorably pleasant to work with:ourfact-checkers always looked forward to his articles, because they arrived asscrupulously annotated manuscripts of the kind that the checking departmenthopes (usually in vain) to receive from every writer. Everyone Cohen workedwith quickly fell into an easy friendship with him, and we will miss both himand his work.<p><br>													<!--INSERT TEXT UP TO													HERE--></blockquote>												<!-- end article --><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br>			<!--NAVIGATION BUTTONS--><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

How did our inner-cityneighborhoods fall into the hell that is milked for blood and profit everynight on the eleven o'clock news? What has gone wrong with young black men? Whyhave so many followed the path of increasingly lethal impulsivity traced in<i>Fist Stick Knife Gun</i>, Geoffrey Canada's recent "personal history ofviolence in America"? We have heard the answers: poverty and racism and drugs,urbanization and the fractured family, the NRA, the media. And most of us aretired of them--or, rather, of their attached politics. <i>All God'sChildren</i>, by coming at today's violence through history's, northern urbanviolence through southern rural violence, black violence through white, putsthe whole problem into a suggestive new context. The ghosts of touchy whitecavaliers may loom over black city kids who kill for being "dissed."Butterfield quotes a white southerner, William Faulkner: "The past is not dead.It isn't even past."<p><blockquote>On April 16th, 1988, at approximately 12:42 p.m. in the visiting room of theShawangunk [New York] state prison, prison guard Earl Porter felt a vicioushate-filled thrust as an eleven-inch stiletto blade was plunged into his chestto the hilt, just a fraction of an inch from penetrating his heart. The hearthad definitely been the target. And as the stiletto blade invaded the chestcavity of prison guard Earl Porter, in search of his most vital organ, Bosket'smost vital organ was singing a song of hateful joy.<br>To this day, the only regret Bosket has is not having killed prison guard EarlPorter and spitting on his corpse --not because he was Earl Porter, but becausehe was the system.</blockquote><p>Willie Bosket, who had murdered two men and claimed to have committed 2,000crimes by age fifteen, wrote that in a letter to the deputy superintendent ofShawangunk. At Bosket's trial the prosecutor read this admission of guilt tothe jury. Refusing counsel, Bosket mounted his own defense. His legs bound byheavy shackles that clattered gloomily across the courtroom floor, his armshandcuffed in front of him, the handcuffs chained to his waist, a further chainconnecting these chains to his shackles, Bosket read from the same letter.<blockquote>Why am I so bitter? Why am I so angry towards the system? . . . The reason isbecause . . . Willie Bosket has been incarcerated since he was nine years oldand was raised by his surrogate mother, the criminal justice system. . . . Thisbeing the case, Bosket is only a monster created by the system he now haunts.</blockquote><p>Reading Bosket's testimony, and thinking that his story might throw light onthe epidemic of violence among black youths, E. R. Shipp, an African-Americaneditor at <i>The New York Times</i>, asked one of her reporters, FoxButterfield, to investigate. It was a felicitous, though unlikely, choice. Oneof the last American reporters to be evacuated from Saigon in 1975,Butterfield, who holds a graduate degree in East Asian studies, had spent muchof his <i>Times</i> career covering Vietnam and China. But he had lived in thepre-civil-rights-era South, where Willie Bosket's roots also lay. AndButterfield's father had been an American historian, someone who believed inthe explanatory significance of origins. "You could not be raised in his housewithout imbibing his reverence for the power of history," Butterfield writes."It was his inspiration . . . that sent me searching into the eighteenth andnineteenth centuries to find out why late-twentieth-century America has becomeplagued with violence."<p>Willie Bosket opened a door on a besetting national problem. "Any so-calledcivilized society," he wrote in answer to a letter from Butterfield asking totell his story, "should be extremely concerned with the sociological,criminological, penological, and hereditary implications involved in the WillieBosket case."<p>Searching for the causes of Bosket's violence in his family history,Butterfield discovered that his father (whom Willie had never met) was amurderer who had been sent to the same reform school at the same age as Willie.His grandfather had a criminal record. His great-grandfather was a "legendarybadman." The surface of Bosket's story kept giving way, sending Butterfielddeeper into the past. <p><font size=5>I</font><font size=3>t was known as "Bloody Edgefield." From the earliest days of settlement theupcountry South Carolina county was the scene of violence and mayhem. Thepeople of Edgefield were mostly Scotch-Irish refugees from war and oppression.Benjamin Franklin called their Pennsylvania cousins "white savages," to whichassessment Butterfield adds "tough, blunt, touchy, hard-drinking, andpugnacious." They lived by a medieval code of honor: if you insulted a man,cheated him, or cast a covetous eye upon his wife, he would kill you.<p>After Cherokee Indians laid waste the county in 1760, gangs of brigands sprangup in Edgefield, abducting women and torturing planters and merchants for theirvaluables. The settlers, outraged, formed into bands of "Regulators" tosuppress the gangs. "It was the first organized vigilante justice in America,"Butterfield writes. These Regulators, according to one historian Butterfieldquotes, "introduced the strain of violence and extremism that was to be thecurse of the upcountry and the nemesis of South Carolina." They punished withthe ferocious sadism of the righteous--once giving 500 lashes to a suspectedhorse thief, for example. This pre-political violence got caught up in theAmerican Revolution, with Revolutionaries and Tories both settling old scoresthrough sanctioned murder.<p>Peace brought no respite to Edgefield. Parson Weems, best known for hishagiographic biography of George Washington, wrote a tract called <i>The Devilin Petticoats, or God's Revenge Against Husband Killing</i>, about a famousEdgefield murderer. She was Becky Cotton, who skewered her first husband,poisoned her second, and axed her third. Under the spell of her tears and herbeauty, a jury acquitted her. Judgment eventually took the shape of one of herown brothers, who murdered her. <p>During the first half of the nineteenth century, according to one study, ruralSouth Carolina had a murder rate four times as high as that of urbanMassachusetts. The rate in Edgefield was thought by one scholar to be perhapstwice that of South Carolina as a whole. Whereas New York City averaged threeto seven murders per 100,000 people, Edgefield's antebellum murder rate wasestimated at eighteen per 100,000--higher than the rate today in the mostviolent state in the country, Louisiana. <p>This was white-on-white violence--over land, women, implacable honor. Yet fromtheir fields and shacks the slaves were watching, learning the bloody code.Among them was Aaron Bosket, Willie's great-great-grandfather. He was owned byFrancis Pickens, who, as the governor of South Carolina, helped to ignite theCivil War by ordering his militia to seize federal property in Charleston. Aslave under white masters, Aaron after the war was a sharecropper under whitelandowners. Cheated of money for his crops, terrorized into deferring to allwhites, Aaron dared not express his anger. His son "Pud" was different.<p><font size=5>I</font><font size=3>t is an extraordinary historical detail: as late as 1910 white landlordswould give each of their black sharecroppers a few lashes of the whip in alittle ritual of degradation--a flesh-memory of slavery. At twenty-one PudBosket would not endure it. "This is the last nigger you're going to whip," hesaid, as he grabbed the whip away from the landlord. After defying a white manPud could not get work, and resorted to stealing from local merchants, forwhich he got a year on the chain gang. Defiance, however, secured hisself-respect. "Don't step on my reputation," he told one man, who paid for hismistake by being thrown so hard against a barn wall that the barn collapsedaround him. "My name is all I got, so I got to keep it. I'm a man of respect."<p> A flaw in Butterfield's architecture is that "respect," the black version ofwhite "honor," grows harder to discern in the turbid motivations of subsequentgenerations of Boskets. Pud's son, James, was a robber, a kidnapper, and achild molester: like the well-balanced Irishman, no doubt he had chips on bothshoulders, but offended pride did not appear to be the reason for his crimes.His son, Butch, did indeed commit one of his three murders when a man "dissed"him, but the other two lacked that motive. As for Willie, Butch's son, he isviolence's child. Raised on the streets of Harlem, Willie is volcanicallytouchy, but his killings sprang more from the motiveless malignity of today'sanomic urban condition than from the history-tinctured motive of "respect."<p>Ordinary people--storekeepers, subway drunks, lonely women--were the Boskets'victims, and it is a problem of <i>All God's Children</i> that they play onlybit parts on the garish Bosket stage. Dangerously much is made of criminals. Itis a convention of imaginative literature--in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Satan isthe compelling character--that has been transposed to factual narratives, withquestionable moral results. It somehow seems wrong, for example, that onefinishes this book feeling sorry for the Boskets' wasted promise. Butch, whomurdered the white woman who helped him try to escape from prison beforeshooting himself in the head, was the first convict ever to be named to PhiBeta Kappa. Though he never got past the third grade, Willie has anear-genius-level IQ. As the letter quoted earlier indicates, the word for himis not "literate" but "literary." One regrets the waste of talent even whileone wishes that murderers like this were not made so fascinating in books likethis. </blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

<font size=5>R</font>.  W.  APPLE JR., whose travel article about eastern 

Germany, <A HREF="../travel/germany.htm">"The Old Made New,"</A> appears in 

this issue, is one of the world's great bon vivants.  He is also among this 

country's best-known political reporters.  As Washington bureau chief of <A 

HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/index.html"> <i>The New York 

Times</i>,</A> Apple keeps up a hectic pace: since January he has often 

visited several states a week as he covers his eighth presidential 

campaign.<p>



On the weekends he does not necessarily retreat to his Georgetown home.  

When we reached him recently, he outlined his Friday plans: appearing on <A 

HREF="http://riceinfo.rice.edu/projects/baker/asiaconf.html">a panel on 

China policy</A> at James Baker's new <A 

HREF="http://riceinfo.rice.edu/projects/baker/index.html">Institute for 

Public Policy,</A> at Rice University, in Houston; attending the <A 

HREF="http://www.neosoft.com/~dorsak/home.htm">Houston Grand Opera's</A> 

production of <i>Four Saints in Three Acts </i>that night; and dining at <A 

HREF="http://www.texasmonthly.com/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=1579310933+0+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve">Cafe 

Annie,</A> the city's most acclaimed restaurant, afterward.  Saturday 

morning he would get on a plane for Iowa to cover the caucuses.  "I guess 

I'm different from most," he said in a notable understatement, "in that my 

idea of relaxation after returning from a journalistic trip has always been 

to plan a pleasure trip."<p>



Wherever he goes, Apple, whose guidebook <i>Apple's Europe</i> is cherished by

travelers, seems to find the most interesting cultural and culinary sites. He

gave us some tips.<p><ul>



<li> "In a new city never be too proud to take a half-day bus tour as an

introduction; you will quickly discover what you want to see more of and what

bores you."<p>



<li> "Just as good cooking is at least fifty percent good shopping, so good travel

requires good preparation--reading, studying maps, talking to friends and

acquaintances who have been where you're going. It's astonishing how many

people never do these obvious things."<p>



<li> "Use the concierge--and if you want tickets to the opera or the theater or a

concert or a game, call or fax the concierge from home. If he or she comes

through, tip generously."<p>



<li> "Off the beaten track I take with me a small pepper mill (to enliven 

bland grub) and my Sony shortwave radio.  It's amazing how many places 

don't have CNN and don't sell the <A 

HREF="http://www.demon.co.uk/iht-lib/index.html"><i>International 

Herald-Tribune</i></A> or the <i>Financial Times</i>."</ul><p>



When we asked him what he thought was the most surprising thing about Eastern

Europe since the fall of communism (which he covered for the <i>Times</i>),

Apple replied, "How long it is taking them to learn how to cook again." Better

pack that pepper mill.

<blockquote>





	<font size=5>T</font>HE RAF called it Operation Thunderclap. On the night of February 13, 1945,

which by macabre coincidence happened to be Fasching, the local Mardi Gras, the

first of three waves of Allied bombers swept over Dresden, the Baroque jewel of

Germany. Proud to be called the Florence of the Elbe, the Saxon capital was a

cherished center of art, music, and learning, one of the shrines of Western

civilization. It was unmarked until that moment by the awful pox of the Second

World War. But by the time the third aerial assault ended, the next morning, it

had been incinerated by more than 650,000 firebombs. <p>



In a few hours of nameless horror at least 39,773 people died, roasted or

suffocated or buried alive, and the actual total may have exceeded 100,000.

More than 1,600 acres were destroyed, including the richly ornamented center of

the old city. Bridges and spires collapsed, the magnificent Zwinger Museum

burned, and the Semper Opera was reduced to rubble. The Frauenkirche, the

Lutheran Cathedral of Our Lady and its famous bell-shaped dome, survived the

raids, as St. Paul's in London survived the worst night of the blitz, but the

next day, with its stone skeleton weakened, it collapsed with a sigh. Only a

few sad shards of smoke-blackened wall remained standing.<p>



Dresden did not die, though the Communists, who took power in 1945, didn't help

much, disfiguring the city with a sterile series of Stalinist boxes along

Prager Strasse, which had been the Fifth Avenue of pre-war Dresden. While

Frankfurt and Munich throbbed with postwar prosperity, Dresden settled into

provincial mediocrity. Much remained unrestored--indeed, in the residential

neighborhoods one still occasionally sees a tree growing out of the window of a

ruined apartment block--but very slowly a rebuilding program got under way, and

with reunification, in 1990, it accelerated sharply.<p>



Last summer I returned to eastern Germany and to <A HREF="http://eietu2.et.tu-dresden.de/arounddd/dd-umgen.htm">Dresden</A> with my wife, Betsey.

A decade before, we had been eyed by hostile, Uzi-toting East German cops as we

ate dinner in a gloomy Hungarian restaurant. This time we got lost on the way

home from an excursion and started up a one-way street the wrong way; noticing

us studying a map, a policeman pulled up, asked cheerfully where we were

headed, and led us back to our digs. Standing before the Frauenkirche, we were

flanked no longer by weeds and rubble but by a snappy, well-run Hilton hotel

and a kind of architectural ossuary, where the stones of the church have been

cleaned, numbered, and laid under canopies. As if by magic, Cold War torpor has

vanished. The Taschenbergpalais, built by the Baroque wizard Matth&auml;us

Daniel P&ouml;ppelmann for the mistress of Prince August the Strong, has been

restored as a <A HREF="http://www.interactive.line.com/lead/newhotels/44a.html">Kempinski</A> hotel. The nearby Zwinger is whole once more, as is the

imposing Semper, where Wagner and Weber conducted, and Strauss's

<i>Rosenkavalier</i> and <i>Salome</i> were first produced. Now the

Frauenkirche's turn has come. At a cost of more than $150 million, most of it

from private donations, the church will be rebuilt, blending old stone with

new--a monument, in the words of Ludwig Guttler, the fundraising chairman, "to

the moral will in our time to heal, start anew, and shape the future.''<p>



When completed, preferably by 2006, Dresden's eight-hundredth anniversary, the

Frauenkirche will symbolize the rebirth of the historic region that lies south

of Berlin and north of Bavaria. This land of Bach and Cranach, Luther and

Goethe and Schiller, languished for almost half a century behind the Iron

Curtain, much of it closed to tourism, the rest more labor than joy for

Westerners to visit. Now, of course, it is totally accessible, and the

expenditure of billions of deutschmarks has helped it begin, if only just, to

catch up to the rest of Germany.<p>

 

Still, pollution remains a problem, with many factories burning lignite and

some, like one we passed near Leuna, south of Halle, spewing tons of sulfurous

smoke into the air. The autobahns and other main highways are excellent, but

turn onto secondary routes and you will find giant potholes, rough

cobblestones, and sometimes miles of roads that have been washed out and not

yet replaced. Outside the main cities you must search for good hotels and,

especially, for restaurants whose food doesn't nail you to your chair with

indigestion.<p>



In the words of the historian Timothy Garton Ash, Germany is "a nation in its

perennial condition of becoming.'' From a traveler's perspective, it is all the

more fascinating for that; the joy of a trip like ours was its blend of today's

problems and achievements with the treasures of yesterday and the day before.<p>

<pre>



</pre>

 <font size=5>A</font>S the seat of the Saxon court, Dresden accumulated its artistic

treasures in much the same way that Berlin, home of the Prussian rulers, and

Munich, where the Bavarian princes lived, built their fine collections. The

Zwinger, one of the greatest of all Baroque creations, was designed by

P&ouml;ppelmann as a "pleasure ground'' for the enjoyment of the royals, with

six linked pavilions--one of them a carillon whose bells are made of Meissen

porcelain--surrounding a vast esplanade dotted with pools and fountains. The

architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner looked at it and exclaimed, "What

exultation in these rocking curves, and yet what grace! It is joyful but never

vulgar; vigorous, boisterous perhaps, but never crude.'' Outside, the buildings

are adorned with gods and goddesses, nymphs, flora, and garlands; inside, the

royal collections are displayed. The pride and joy of the Sempergalerie is

Raphael's luminous <i>Sistine Madonna</i>, but there are also masterworks by

Van Eyck, Vermeer, and Veronese, plus views of Dresden as it looked in the

eighteenth century, painted by the Italian Bernardo Bellotto (who rather

confusingly used the same pseudonym, Canaletto, as his more famous uncle,

Antonio Canal). Other rooms hold the world's best collection of Meissen, the

first European porcelain successfully to imitate that of China.<p>



The Albertinum is another great museum, a fifteen-minute stroll away, down by

the Elbe; you can get there by way of the Br&uuml;hlsche Terrasse, overlooking

the river. Four rooms of the Albertinum's Green Vault are crammed with bibelots

created by goldsmiths, silversmiths, and jewelers from Dresden and elsewhere,

mostly in the eighteenth century. Worked in pearls, rubies, emeralds, diamonds,

rock crystal, enamel, tortoiseshell, gold, platinum, and silver in unimaginable

quantities, they bear witness to the era's taste for wretched excess. Yet the

best of them, such as the Court of the Great Mogul, a minute evocation of an

Indian birthday party, transform what might be a mere curiosity into art. The

137 golden figures of this piece took the Dinglinger brothers of Dresden, the

Cellinis of their day, seven years to make. Older pieces, including Luther's

ring and Ivan the Terrible's drinking bowl, are also on view.<p>



Even if you can't get a ticket for the opera, you should take one of the tours

of Gottfried and Manfred Semper's wonderful, ennobling theater. We saw it in

the company of a charming old man named Gerd Straumer, the chief of the house's

guide service. He had stayed up all night brushing up on his English, a

language he had not spoken, he said, since high school half a century ago. He

did fine, and when I blushed as he recounted the details of the 1945 attack, he

protested gently, "But Hitler started the war, not the Americans, and you are

not Bomber Harris"--the British commander who sent the planes to Dresden.

Twice burned and twice rebuilt, the opera seats 1,323 people in an elegant

nineteenth-century ambiance of gold, burgundy, beige, and white. A 1.9-ton

brass chandelier hangs in the center, inscribed with the names of Wagner,

Gluck, Mozart, and Meyerbeer, among others. But much here is unobtrusively

modern, too--wooden panels have been replaced by plaster replicas as a

precaution against fire, and the stage is a technological marvel, with sixteen

square platforms that can be raised, lowered, or tilted, plus a revolving

circular platform in the rear, all controlled by the latest in electronic

devices.<p>



Dresden is a good walking town, and a few sorties from the center demonstrate

the changes the city is going through. Old, soot-blackened buildings stand

shoulder to shoulder with Communist-modern blobs and, on our visit, West German

banks set up temporarily in prefabs. Across the river we found a neighborhood

in transition. The R&auml;hnitzgasse, in a pedestrian precinct, is lined with

lavish Baroque townhouses. Some have been lovingly restored, such as No. 19,

which is now the B&uuml;low Residenz, a thirty-two-room hotel with an

outstanding restaurant called the Caroussel, and No. 17, with a beautiful

fa&ccedil;ade embellished with stucco cherubs and pineapples.<p>



Dresden is also a terrific excursion center. One day we headed southeast along

the Elbe to a promontory called the Bastei, which affords spectacular views

over the cliffs and gorges of Saxon Switzerland, the region that lies between

Dresden and the Czech border. You can pick out the silhouette of

K&ouml;nigstein, a castle so isolated on its pinnacle that it was used for

centuries to house political prisoners. Pillnitz, another of P&ouml;ppelmann's

triumphs, can be visited on the way back. In a burst of late-Baroque

playfulness the architect combined Corinthian columns with pagoda-like roof

lines and cupolas in this pleasure palace. It sounds awful but isn't. Another

day we headed for Meissen itself, twelve miles northwest of Dresden, a pretty

old town hugging the left bank of the Elbe. The famous factory is open to

visitors, you can have lunch at the sixteenth-century Weinstube Richter, and

you might want to head home by way of the Moritzburg, a striking

ocher-and-white chateau with massive round towers at the corners, surrounded by

an artificial lake.<p>

<pre>



</pre>

<font size=5>A</font>S we drove out of Dresden for a week-long loop through the heartland, we

passed the spot in the suburbs where in 1980 poor Dresdeners, out scavenging

with gunnysacks for lumps of coal that had fallen from the backs of trucks, had

shaken their fists at our big capitalist car. Now the spot is marked by a

billboard advertising American cigarettes, and BMWs and Volkswagens sped by as

we pulled over. No matter how much they may grumble, the Ossies--East

Germans--have grabbed the brass ring; alone among the people of the former

satellite states, they had an automatic link not only to prosperous cousins in

West Germany but through them to the European Union.<p>



Our first stop was Weimar, in Thuringia. To foreigners, the town's name recalls

the ill-fated government based there, which flourished briefly between the wars

and then succumbed to hyperinflation. But to Germans, this pretty town is a

cultural and spiritual capital. Goethe wrote <i>Faust</i> there and for

twenty-six years directed the renowned National Theater, and his friend

Schiller moved to Weimar in 1799. Their houses, restored, are open to the

public. Both Bach and Liszt served as choirmasters at the Church of St. Peter

and St. Paul, which can boast as well of the great Crucifixion triptych, the

last masterpiece of Lucas Cranach the Elder. In the town museum there are more

works by this great contemporary of D&uuml;rer's. But Weimar is pre-eminently a

town for strolling. Visit the market square, where stands overflowing with

fruits and vegetables jostle with bratwurst carts and flower vendors; wander

down back streets, overhung by red-tile roofs; stop for a quick lunch at Zum

Zwiebel, a homey little pub tucked into a corner near the church, with strings

of onions hanging everywhere; explore the Schillerstrasse, a pedestrian street

that leads through the center of this most pleasant of the region's towns. Here

and throughout Germany you will find English widely spoken.<p>



Not far west of Weimar is another picturesque old town, Erfurt, a

photographer's delight; it is the center of the eastern German horticultural

trade and in spring and summer looks every inch of it. Erfurt is worth visiting

if only to see the Renaissance Kr&auml;merbr&uuml;cke, lined with half-timbered

houses and antique shops, and to indulge yourself at San Remo, which must be

the best ice-cream parlor north of the Alps. Another forty-five minutes' drive

to the west lies Eisenach and its great castle, the Wartburg, set on a crag to

the south. History's hand wrote large here. <A HREF="http://www.let.rug.nl/Linguistics/diversen/bach/map.html">Bach</A> was born in Eisenach; Luther

hid from a hostile Pope in the Wartburg, translating the Bible from Greek into

German and paving the way for the Reformation; and Walther von der Vogelweide,

Germany's most famous minstrel, won a celebrated song contest in the castle in

1207, immortalized in Wagner's <i>Tannh&auml;user</i>. The castle can be seen

only on guided tours; it's more than worth it, even if you don't speak

German.<p>



My pleasure in the Wartburg was extinguished by a bleak early-morning visit to

Buchenwald, hidden amid the tranquil beeches of the Ettersberg north of Weimar.

Here 65,000 men, women, and children from thirty-five countries met their

deaths, and 200,000 others suffered. I went because I felt compelled to. The

prisoners' barracks have disappeared, only the outlines of their foundations

remaining. The gatehouse bears the slogan "<i>Jedem das Seine</i>" ("To Each

His Own"), and the watchtowers, searchlights, and crematorium ovens are

equally chilling. It embarrasses me to admit it, but the rest of Buchenwald

reminded me of nothing so much as a sturdy summer camp, and I left thinking how

right Hannah Arendt had been to write of the banality of this monstrous evil.<p>

<pre>



</pre>

<font size=5>L</font>EAVING Weimar, we drove north through the Harz Mountains (the birdseed people

added a 't' to the name) to the little town of Quedlinburg, which has

enjoyed two brief bursts of celebrity in an otherwise obscure history. In the

tenth century an abbey was founded there by Otto I, the Germanic King who took

up the job of empire-building where Charlemagne left off. His time and that of

his successors were an epoch of artistic brilliance, as attested by both the

austerely magnificent Romanesque church of St. Servatius and the exquisite

medieval objects in its treasury. The jewel-encrusted twelfth-century Samuhel

Gospel cover, a seventh-century ivory comb, a tenth-century reliquary box, and

other glorious pieces dwelt in Quedlinburg for hundreds of years, with the

exception of a brief hiatus during the Napoleonic era. But in May of 1945, when

other treasures were returned to the cathedral from wartime storage in nearby

caves, the best were found to be missing. Not for almost fifty years did anyone

learn that they had been stolen by a young American lieutenant, Joe T. Meador,

of Whitewright, Texas. After he died, in 1980, his family tried to sell them,

setting off an international rumpus that ended, happily, in the objects'

triumphant return to St. Servatius. Viewing them in their ancient

ecclesiastical setting, I found it almost impossible to imagine them secreted

in some small-town Texas bank vault.<p>



We also stopped that fine summer day in Naumburg, whose insufficiently

celebrated cathedral combines Romanesque and Gothic elements. The sculptures of

the church's benefactors, carved in the west choir by an unknown master, mark

the summit of the stone carver's art in medieval Germany. Their original

polychrome decoration is intact. The individualism of the faces, the serene

seriousness of their expressions, the tactile magnificence of their garments,

is quite unforgettable. The portrait of Uta, the lovely wife of Margrave

Ekkehard II, still haunts me.<p>



Then <A HREF="http://www.wittenberg.de/e/seiten/home.html">Wittenberg</A>. Martin Luther, professor of moral philosophy there, set in

motion in 1517 one of the mightiest movements in humanity's spiritual history

by nailing to the doors of the palace church his ninety-five theses condemning

the abuses of the Catholic Church. Luther's tomb and that of his lieutenant,

Melanchthon, are inside the church, and fine statues of the two stand in the

marketplace. But the doors themselves were destroyed by French gunners in 1760,

and the bronze replacements, on which the theses were duly inscribed, date from

1858. <p>



That isn't the only letdown in Wittenberg, which, as the son of two graduates

of Wittenberg University in Ohio, I had long dreamed of visiting. Though the

town is well preserved and its Rathaus splendid, there is something sad about

Wittenberg, as if no one cared much about it. The spirit of Goethe lives in

Weimar, that of Bach in Leipzig, but Luther, such a brooding presence in my

childhood catechism, seemed curiously absent from Wittenberg's forlorn, almost

flowerless streets.<p>

<font size=5>W</font>E left <A HREF="http://www.uni-leipzig.de/leipzig/ausflug/stadtple.htm">Leipzig</A> for last. During the long Communist nightmare this city of half

a million, which was East Germany's biggest after Berlin, remained more open to

the West than others, thanks mainly to its trade fairs, which date back to the

twelfth century, and its dozens of book publishers. Leipzig was instrumental in

the overthrow of the old regime, with Kurt Masur, then the conductor of the

city's Gewandhaus Orchestra and now the music director of the New York

Philharmonic, playing a prominent political role. The modern opera house and

concert hall come up short on charm if long on acoustics, and much of the rest

of the town is ugly, but the Altstadt, or old city, has a few well-restored

buildings (the old Rathaus, 1556; the old produce exchange, 1687; the Romanus

house, 1704). For me, this is above all Bach's city. If you can, visit the

oft-restored St. Thomas's Church for vespers on Sunday, when the Thomanchor,

which Bach led for twenty-seven years, sings his cantatas and motets. Bach's

tomb in the church is marked with a plain three-foot-by-six-foot slab bearing

only his name. Across the street stands a period house, now a small but

excellent Bach museum.<p>



The Fine Arts Museum may not be the Zwinger, and the exterior looks as if

someone dumped a sack of coal dust over it, but we were excited by the pictures

and the quality of their installation--a fine Van der Weyden Visitation, a

great Hals, a greater D&uuml;rer of a girl with braids, a Beckmann portrait of

a merchant. In the last gallery note is taken of the 394 works confiscated in

1937 by the Nazis, in their campaign against "degenerate art," with photographs

of the paintings and a sad acknowledgment that most have been lost.<p>



Mostly we wandered, the way one does in big cities, picking out remnants of the

recent past, such as broken neon signs touting Bulgarian wines, amid reminders

of a more sedate time, including the coffeehouse Zum Kaffeebaum, at Kleine

Fleischergasse 4, with a Turk depicted over the doorway offering coffee to a

cherub. The M&auml;dler Passage, Leipzig's showplace, is an animated T-shaped

arcade. Off it open the Auerbachs Keller, a restaurant mentioned by Goethe in

<i>Faust</i>, and all sorts of smart, tempting shops, including the doll dealer

Die Puppengalerie (at No. 21) and, just outside, at Neumarkt 16, Schulze's

Delikatessen. Slowly renovation is gaining the upper hand over dilapidation,

and the posters displayed at every street corner--"<i>Leipzig Kommt!</i>"

("Leipzig Is Coming!")--seem well within the bounds of acceptable civic

boosterism.<p>



Sipping a last drink on our last night, at the Inter-continental Hotel, we met

a young bartender (what else?) who seemed to us to grasp the new East as well

as anyone we had talked to. "I'm a West Berliner,'' he said. "I came here

because this is where the opportunities are going to open up. I belong here

now. You can only tell me from my Ossie friends by our accents, not by our

clothes or what we do or what we want out of life. With the older ones, it's

different. They carry East Germany around in their heads, and they will never

really get rid of it."

<blockquote>

	<font size=5>A</font><font size=3> LITTLE more than a
	hundred years ago an article appeared in these pages titled <A
	href="./greeno.htm">"The 	Present Requirements for Admission to Harvard
	College," </a>by James Jay Greenough. Among the skills to be demonstrated
by candidates for admission was a "working knowledge" of Latin, Greek, French,
and German. "In the elementary examination in the classics," Greenough
explained, "the test applied is the translation at sight of passages from
Caesar and Nepos in Latin, and from Xenophon in Greek." These authors, he went
on, "all have a simple narrative style, and their thought is neither involved
nor profound, so that their works are entirely within the comprehension of the
average boy." <p>

From the perspective of the present day that article, published in May of 1892,
prompts several thoughts about America's recurring debate over what academic
standards should be--thoughts also prompted by the cover story in this issue,
written by the distinguished historian Paul Gagnon, which in part describes why
the work of the National Council on Education Standards and Testing came to
naught, amid much acrimony. By their very nature, academic standards can never
be permanent. They have changed as the nation's demographic makeup has been
roiled by immigration and other forms of social mobility--such as the advent of
mass public secondary education and, later, of a system of mass higher
education. They have changed, too, with the evolution of technology and of the
world economy, and the evolution in American thinking about what it means to be
a mature, moral, and perhaps even happy human being. <p>

At the <i>Atlantic</i>'s offices a long wall of bound volumes contains every
issue back to the first one, in 1857. As it happens, those volumes cover
virtually the whole period in the nation's history during which educators have
tried to bring the American classroom to order. We have published writers on
the subject with voices as diverse as those of James Bryant Conant, Jonathan
Kozol, and Oscar Handlin. Looking back at that body of work, one is struck by
how regular a theme has been the search for standards, how eloquent have been
the pleas of the visionaries, and how constant has been the frustration as time
and again the reformers have at best only winged the target--even when everyone
agreed on what it was. And, of course, we haven't always agreed. <p>

Lamentations have their uses, but it is quite another thing to point out a path
of possibility. Paul Gagnon stands firmly in this second tradition. He is angry
at much of what he sees in the schools--and at much of what he saw while an
official at the Department of Education in 1991-1992. But his article in this
issue is a vigorous plea to the states to pick up a challenge that the federal
government has failed to meet.<p>

But you call raising the retirement age and lowering the inflation adjustmentfor benefits "painless." They're not.<p>Let's take a look at the arithmetic. In 2005, the year in which you propose to increasethe retirement age from sixty-six (under current law) to seventy, the averagesixty-six-year-old will have a life expectancy of about seventeen years. Thus raisingthe retirement age by four years will wipe out almost a quarter of the averagesixty-six-year-old retiree's Social Security benefits. That's a pretty huge reduction.<P>It's even worse than that for the many moderate- and low-income workers in theirmid-sixties who are simply worn out after spending a lifetime doing hard physicalwork-and who tend to die sooner than the well-off. For example, a laborer with a life expectancy of only ten years at age sixty-six would lose <P>40 percent of his or her Social Security benefits under your proposed boost in theretirement age.<P>Then there's your plan to reduce Social Security benefits by letting inflation erodetheir real value-a step that, you insist to current retirees, "will not <I>cut</I> yourpayments" but "will slow the rate by which they increase." If you reduce inflationindexing by, say, one percent a year, then over ten years a typical Social Securityrecipient will see an inflation-adjusted cut in benefits of about $4,300-equal to abouthalf a year's worth of average benefits in today's dollars. That's $4,300 less in realfood, clothing, and shelter that Social Security checks will buy over the ten years.<P>So how is all this "painless"? Well, I suppose it might seem relatively pain-free forwell-off people who don't expect to retire until they're seventy anyway and for whom$400 or $500 a year is a bagatelle. But that description hardly fits most Americans.<P><b>Robert S. McIntyre</b><br><i>Director, Citizens for Tax Justice </i><br><i>Washington, D.C.</i>	<br> <br> <br><font size=5>I</font> recommend a simple but important refinement to yourrecommendation on how to save Social Security. Don't wait ten years to raise the minimum age for receiving SocialSecurity payments to seventy; begin to raise the age for receiving payments one month ayear every year until the system is in balance.<p>You are quite right about giving people "time to plan." This same principle should beapplied to other important matters such as changes in the tax laws. If, for example,one wanted to institute a taxation system in which each dollar was taxed at the samerate and in which there were no deductions, present taxpayers could be given the optionof staying with the current system or changing to the new system. That option couldextend for ten or twenty or even thirty years, so that plans that had been constructedon the basis of the present tax system would not be unfairly disrupted.<P>Such gradualism has been denied us at great cost and on the basis that one Congresscannot pass laws binding upon the next Congress. It is true that the next Congress mayhave an entirely different composition and wish to undo the perceived mischief ofpreceding Congresses. Whether this represents desirable flexibility or intolerablevacillation may depend upon whether you are a member of the gray and retiring or theyoung and at work.<P>But it is certainly clear that we must take a longer perspective than that of thetwo-year congressional term if we are to avoid generational conflicts, and SocialSecurity is one of the most pressing.<P><b>John R. Dykers Jr.</b><br><i>Siler City, N.C.</i><br> <br> <br><A NAME="delayed childbearing"><H3>Delayed Childbearing</H3></A><font size=5>G</font>ina Maranto's laudable article ("Delayed Childbearing," June <I>Atlantic</I>)recommends that "America put its money where its mouth is on family values." I couldn'tagree more. But we need to go even further than she suggests. Though it appearsotherwise, the career-family dilemma is beyond the realm of the individual womanemployee. Maternity leave, parental leave, and excellent child care are all essentialsupports if family values are to be taken seriously. In addition, work itself needs tobe restructured. Felice Schwartz got clobbered for suggesting special treatment formothers, but unless corporate America can comprehend that the well-being of the nextgenerations will determine the fate of our nation ("economy" might be more meaningful),nothing will change. Although some shifts are occurring, the individualistic,competitive nature of career advancement makes it difficult for talented, competent,responsible women to take time off for childbearing if they have an interest inadvancement. They can't have babies and guard their territory at work too.<p>Work assignment by project, rather than the traditional up-the-ladder approach, wouldhelp, as would tax breaks for child care and other family-related expenses. Theemphasis should be on a woman's competence to accomplish her assignments, not herseniority or ability to fence off her empire. I understand that people who choose acareer over children resent the inconvenience of motherhood (or fatherhood) on the job,and I can see their point. However, to deal with the deep problems facing both businessand families, we need to take a bigger, more creative view of the workplace. Iftalented women could have babies in their twenties and know that they weren'thopelessly off the career track, it would be an easier decision for them.<P><b>Nina Boyd Krebs</b><br><i>Sacramento, Calif.</i><br> <br> <br><font size=5>A</font>s a former infertility patient and a woman who waited "too long" to conceive, I wasstruck by the following sentence in Gina Maranto's article: "In the bulk of cases,infertility specialists have found, older women who fail to become pregnant usingembryos made with their own eggs succeed when the eggs come from a youngerdonor."<p>My question is, Can this possibly be true? To me, the word "bulk" implies a majority,and a substantial one at that. Is this what Maranto actually means to say?<P>The practice we used, Marrs/Vargyas, in Santa Monica, California, told us last yearthat their success rate stood at 36 percent (though recently it has been running at 58percent), and I know that Mark Sauer also had a success rate of 36 percent for severalyears there. A 36 percent take-home-baby rate, while high, does not, to me, constitutethe "bulk" of patients. One person I know, a forty-two-year-old woman who is currentlypregnant courtesy of donor eggs, says that her physician's rate is now over 50percent.<P>Does Gina Maranto have any idea what the actual rate is?<P><b>Catherine Johnson</b><br><i>Studio City, Calif.</i><br> <br> <br><font size=5>C</font>alling on "society" to enable women to delay careers instead of their childbearingsounds nice but will not get the job done.<p>Let's face it: If they could, employers would eliminate most employee-rights laws,including the Family and Medical Leave Act's limited unpaid leave. They tend to look toshort-term profit rather than to the long-term benefits (even financial ones) of ahappier and more stable work force.<P>The exemplary paid family-and-medical-leave policies of European countries did not comeabout because one employer took the lead and others followed. Politicians created themthrough laws. In such an environment employers eventually adjust to make similarprofits, but only when everyone else is required to follow the rules also.<P>The only way "society" can eliminate delays in childbearing is to cause delays in there-election of our representatives in Washington who oppose eliminating them. Untilthen it is all just talk.<P><b>Don D. Sessions</b><br><i>Mission Viejo, Calif.</i><br> <br> <br><font size=5>A</font>s Gina Maranto correctly asserts, conception is more difficult for women to achieveonce they reach their thirties. The medical evidence for that is quite convincing. Sheis also right that family-friendly policies in the workplace would make the transitionto parenthood much easier for young women. However, the article implies that most, ifnot all, women who delay childbearing do so for voluntary, career-related reasons andthat the medical community should counsel them against such delay. I am afraid this hasthe potential to create more problems than it solves.<p>     Today many women remain unmarried during their twenties. In fact, two thirds of thoseaged twenty to twenty-four have never wed. The same is true for one third of those agedtwenty-five to twenty-nine. So, unless we want to encourage unwed motherhood,childbirth is simply not an option for many young women. I suppose an argument could bemade that voluntary, career-related reasons have kept them from marrying. But we couldequally argue that they have just not been lucky enough to find an appropriate partner.Second marriages also present difficulties for the "earlier is better" thesis. Nearlyhalf of all marriages each year are remarriages, and the average remarrying bride is inher early thirties. In spite of their age, many of these people will want children withtheir new spouses. <P>Then there is the issue of divorce. Regardless of how one feels about it, the fact isthat currently half of all marriages end in divorce, and the highest rates, by far, areamong young people. Since arguably the worst effects of divorce accrue to children, acase could be made for advocating that a couple not have children until their marriagehas stabilized to the point that divorce appears unlikely. This would put aconsiderable number of would-be parents well into their thirties. I'm not necessarilyrecommending such an approach. I merely wish to suggest that an overemphasis on the"biologically correct" age for childbearing can have unintended, and potentiallynegative, consequences.<P><b>Paula Mergenhagen</b><br><i>Nashville, Tenn.</i><br> <br> <br><i>Gina Maranto replies:</I><p>Regarding egg-donation success rates: by "bulk" I did indeed mean "majority." Accordingto my <I>American Heritage Dictionary</I>, the word means "the major portion orgreater part." Richard Paulson and Mark Sauer's pioneering infertility group at theUniversity of Southern California (Sauer has just left the program for ColumbiaUniversity) has achieved consistently high success rates for egg donation. Paulsontells me that at present well over 50 percent of women entering the programspecifically for the procedure go home with babies. Dorothy Mitchell-Leef, in Atlanta,also reports a take-home-baby rate above 50 percent, and says that top programs aroundthe country are averaging 45 to 55 percent. As Catherine Johnson no doubt knows, ratesvary considerably among practices, for reasons that are not always identifiable. TheSociety for Advanced Reproductive Technology, just now issuing results from 1993,calculated a 31.3 percent average per-cycle success rate for egg donation for thatyear. The caveat is that thatfigure reflects the well-known fact that many infertilityspecialists offer procedures because their patients demand them, whether or not thephysicians themselves have had any success performing those procedures. This drags thenational average down.<P>Paula Mergenhagen appears to have misunderstood me. I singled out women's need toestablish themselves professionally as one important-but certainly not the only-factorin the delayed-childbearing trend. I also mentioned that the tendency to marry laterand have children at a later age has dominated Western societies for some 200 years,the obvious implication being that many women today exemplify the phenomenon. I wouldhardly advocate that women rush en masse into single motherhood-nor do I think my pieceeven intimated such a thing. My point, and the point of the physicians speaking out onthe subject, was not to argue that all women must have their children in their twentiesbut rather to expose some received wisdom as not terribly wise, and to suggest thatwomen take the medical facts into consideration insofar as their life circumstancespermit. As for divorce, although it hovers around 50 percent in the United States thesedays, one suspects that few couples actively intend that their marriage will fail, andit seems unreasonable to suggest that everyone wait to have children until theirsupposed risk of divorce has diminished to nil. At what point would Ms. Mergenhagendeclare a marriage stable enough to pass the test? Five years? Ten? Twenty?<P><br> <br> <br><A NAME="diversity myth"><H3>Diversity Myth</H3></A><font size=5>I</font>n "The Diversity Myth: America's Leading Export" (May <I>Atlantic</I>),BenjaminSchwarz says that the Civil War was a failure of democracy. There are a  lot ofAmericans who still believe that the United States fought and won the Civil War inorder that "government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall notperish from the earth." But to Schwarz that would be "the hortatory version of ourhistory."<p>Schwarz would have it that northern expansionism caused both the Mexican War and theCivil war: "To [John Quincy] Adams . . . there was, of course, no doubt that Americashould effect this imperial union. . . . By 1846 America was ready to pounce." But JohnQuincy Adams fought in Congress to <I>prevent </I>the annexation of Texas, which waswhat sparked the Mexican War. The chief opposition to the Mexican War came from thesame group that supported the Civil War fifteen years later, and for the same reason:opposition to slavery.<P>In Schwarz's view, racial and financial power run this country, and moral principle isan "abstract and bloodless notion." But our trust in individual wisdom, imperfectly andinconsistently though we may live it, sets us profoundly apart from many other nationsin our own time, and it set us apart from almost all nations in 1861. If that principledoesn't always, or even usually, prevail, it is still at the core of this nation.<P>In the democracy of Lincoln and Jefferson, military and financial power are in serviceof that vision. Schwarz gives us a different model; his typical American of 1790 isJohn Jay, who said, "A country should be run by the people who own it." The UnitedStates has held on to Jefferson's ideal, even though much of the time it has taken thepath of Jay. Schwarz's failure to acknowledge the still-radical implications of ourdeeper national vision and its power for good is a hole at the center of his view ofthis country.<P><b>Jonathan Hale</b><br><i>Watertown, Mass.</i><br> <br> <br><i>Benjamin Schwarz replies:</i><p>Contrary to Jonathan Hale's assertion, I did not state that northern expansionism"caused"the Mexican War. John Quincy Adams, whom I quoted in my article, <P>envisioned the expansion of the United States over North America. This belief that thecountry had a "manifest destiny"to expand over the continent was common amongpolitical leaders, both northern and southern, in the United States. Adams did opposethe annexation of Texas, but not because he was opposed to U.S. expansionism per se.Rather, his opposition was based on his fear that if Texas were annexed in 1845,political power within the United States would shift to the South. <P>I can't accept Mr. Hale's moralistic interpretation of the Civil War. Abraham Lincolnrepeatedly asserted that the issue at stake was the preservation of the Union (a unionin which the North held political preponderance)-not the abolition of slavery. Theissue that divided the country at the time of the 1860 election, and that sparked theCivil War, was the extension of slavery into the territories, not its abolition.<P>Mr. Hale also quotes me out of context. Inever wrote that moral principle was "anabstract and bloodless notion." Isaid that many nation-states that are based on ethnicor religious identity would regard the civil state as "an abstract and bloodlessnotion."<P>John Jay was not a typical American-any more than were Lincoln and Jefferson. I quotedJay's statement from the <I>Federalist</I>, a collection of papers that most historiansand political theorists regard as the most profound and original American contributionto political thought. Jay was a central figure in the framing and defense of theConstitution, and hence was an important architect of the system of government underwhich we live. Incidentally, Jay's notions of the relationship of property ownership topolitical power were held by all the founding fathers.<P>Finally, Idon't dispute the point Mr. Hale makes about the importance of Americanideals. To me, however, the central-and tragic-fact of our history is that we are anation haunted by the chasm between our ideals and our deeds. Enraptured by a vision ofwhat we ought to be, America has for 200 years yearned, in the words of Martin LutherKing Jr., "to live out the true meaning of its creed." Mr. Hale's view of Americalargely ignores this ambiguity.<P><br> <br> <br><A NAME="new england fisheries"><H3>New England Fisheries</H3></A><font size=5>D</font>eborah Cramer's article on Georges Bank fisheries ("Troubled Waters,"June<I>Atlantic</I>) is excellent, readable, and on the spot. However, she is notsufficiently forceful when writing "To preserve New England's fisheries, it will beessential to set quotas that are designed to protect the health of a fishery, not theshort-term economic needs of fishermen." In order to preserve fisheries, twofundamental changes are needed. First, there must be a shift in the way people thinkabout fisheries from a focus on the yield (biological or economic) to a focus on thehealth of the fish stock. Second, we require means to implement this shift, in a mannerthat embraces, rather than ignores, the great uncertainty of the natural and humanworlds. Recent work by my colleagues Tim Lauck, Colin Clark, and Gordon Munro, at theUniversity of British Columbia, and me has shown that a practicable idea is a reservesystem, whereby large areas in which the fish population resides are <I>never</I>accessible to fishing pressure. Our calculations suggest that in order to protectstocks, harvested regions should generally be no more than 20 to 30 percent of thetotal area occupied by the stock. The result may be disquieting, but it has morecomfort than the economic extinction of all the fisheries in the world.<p><b>Marc Mangel</b><br><i>University of California at Davis<br>Davis, Calif.</i><br> <br> <br><font size=5>D</font>eborah Cramer is absolutely correct when she places blame for the destruction of theNew England groundfishery resource on the politicized, self-serving New England FisheryManagement Council, which has ignored science for a short-term gain, and destroyed aprecious national resource. Sadly, all fisheries have been tainted by this terribleexample.<p>For almost twenty years the management of our federal fisheries has been left to suchregional councils, with varying results. A study by the World Wildlife Fund found themriddled with conflicts of interest. (Interestingly, current law exempts these fisherycouncils from conflict-of-interest statutes that apply to every other part of thefederal government.)<P>The current management system has also been a disaster from the economic point of view.The Commerce Department estimates that U.S. marine fisheries are producing far belowtheir potential, at a cost of more than $3 billion a year to the U.S. economy.<P>Fortunately, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council has managed the waters offAlaska very conservatively, with separate quotas for each species. North Pacificgroundfish quotas have always been set below what scientists say is safe to harvestwhile sustaining the fishery. As opposed to New England's shameful taking of 60 percentof the resource, cited by Cramer, annual groundfish quotas in the Bering Sea average11.6 percent. The result is an abundant fishery that has actually grown by more thanfour million metric tons since the council began to manage it, in 1977. Some species,such as flatfish, have actually quadrupled.<P>Unfortunately, although the total quota is set wisely, there are too many boats chasingthat quota. This results in shorter seasons and more dangerous and wasteful fishing.Individual quotas, a system in which each fisherman is awarded a percentage of thetotal quota to be fished year round, would allow the harvest of the North Pacific toproceed more rationally. When individual quotas are transferable, and can be bought,sold, or leased (or revoked for bad fishing behavior), fishermen have incentives tocare for the resource over the long term rather than squander it. Had individual,transferable quotas been in place in New England, there would very likely be enoughcod, haddock, and yellowtail for future generations.<P><b>Joseph R. Blum</b><br><i>Executive Director American Factory Trawler Association<br>Seattle,Wash.</i><br> <br> <br><font size=5>D</font>eborah Cramer's ignorance of economics is appalling. As every schoolboy knows,overfishing creates <I>shortages</I>, shortages lead to <I>rising prices</I>, andrising prices create <I>incentives</I> for more individual fish to grow to maturity andspawn. In a genuinely free market, without the dead hand of government interference,it's a self-correcting problem. And it's the same story in the case of dinosaurs andpetroleum.<p><b>John F.

<blockquote><font size=4><i><b>Each year some 2.5 million high school students match wits with the Scholastic

Aptitude Tests. The results go a long way toward determining who gets into the

most selective colleges. The tests are the subject of a growing debate. Do they

really discover the best and the brightest? Or do they chiefly identify the

richest and the most expensively educated?</b></i></font><p>



<br>



<font size=5>O</font><font size=3>N a bright weekday morning last October, with the school year just begun,

several dozen fresh-faced boys sat crouched over little desks. The boys were

fifth-formers--high school juniors--at St. Albans, a private Episcopal school

in Washington, D.C.; the object of their attention was the Preliminary

Scholastic Aptitude Test, the first stage in the examinations known to millions

as "the College Boards."<p>



<p>



<p>



Like other test-takers, they looked tense and worried; as the examination books

were collected and the No. 2 pencils put away, they gathered in clusters to

discuss their answers. "How many intersections are there between three parallel

lines and three non-parallel lines? You said twelve? God, I could only find

eleven." But their worry was within bounds; St. Albans boys always did well, on

tests and in college admissions. The year before, half of the St. Albans senior

class had scored in the mid-600s or above on the verbal portion of the

Scholastic Aptitude Test. On a scale running from 200 to 800, this placed them

above 97 percent of their contemporaries. Their scores on the mathematical

portion were even better. The richness of their education gave them SAT-style

skills--close reading, puzzle-solving, facility with the nuance of

language--almost as an incidental benefit. In one room, seniors would discuss

the mathematical formulae of Leibniz while, next door, juniors analyzed

Voltaire's parody of Leibnizian optimism in Candide. By comparison, antonym

questions and reading-comprehension passages were a piece of cake.<p>



<p>



<p>



Shortly after the fifth-formers finished their examination, a calculus teacher

joked with one of the sixth-form (senior) boys. "Three touchdowns in the

football game, straight A in English class, 750 on the SAT--Jones, you're

Harvard's dream." "Seven-eighty," the boy, smiling modestly, replied.<p>



<p>



<p>



A few weeks later, elsewhere in the District of Columbia, students from a large

public high school took the SAT. The city's high schools have been

overwhelmingly black and lower-class since the court decisions ordering

desegregation, busing, and an end to the "tracking" system; many affluent

families, black and white, have moved to the suburbs or send their children to

private schools. Median SAT scores in the District--when the school system

chooses to reveal them--are 200 to 300 points lower than those at St. Albans.

Several years ago, there was a minor scandal when the valedictorian of a local

high school, a straight-A student admired by all he met, was refused admission

nearly everywhere he applied to college, so miserable were his SAT scores.<p>



<p>



<p>



A number of students left this test center early, ignoring the test booklet's

admonition to use extra time to recheck answers. Large portions of their answer

sheets were blank. One black teenager pulled on his Washington Redskins jacket,

lit a cigarette, and joined a group of friends. "Shit, man," he said, "what's

the point?"<p>



<p>



<p>



Each year, more than 2.5 million students sit hunched in testing centers,

taking the PSAT, the SAT, "Achievement" and "Advanced Placement" tests to give

advanced standing in college, admissions tests for law and medical schools, the

Graduate Record Exam (GRE), and dozens of smaller examinations. Most of these

are written, scored, and controlled by the Educational Testing Service of

Princeton, New Jersey (which, contrary to popular understanding, is not

synonymous with The College Board. The Board is an organization of more than

2500 colleges, schools, school systems, and education associations, whose

members hire the ETS to write their tests). For its work, the nonprofit ETS

takes in about $80 million a year.<p>



<p>



<p>



The SAT has been part of American education for more than fifty years; the ETS,

for more than thirty. But never have the testers been more under siege than in

the past twelve months. Last November, a few representatives of the ETS and The

College Board, standing incognito in the back of the crowd, heard one speaker

after another lambaste them at the National Conference on Testing in

Washington, D.C. "The dishonesty of the ETS reminds me of the arms

manufacturers," said Terry Herndon, executive director of the National

Education Association. "They say guns don't kill people, people kill people.

The ETS says it's not their fault if the tests are abused--someone else is to

blame."<p>



<p>



<p>



"We've always been told that the tests might have problems, but we had to live

with them, because they're the best we have," said Anna Kahn, national

secretary of the PTA. "Now we're beginning to question that."<p>



<p>



<p>



"Standardized tests are used from the cradle to the grave, to select, reject,

stratify, classify, and sort people," said Gerda Steele of the NAACP, "and they

are used in ways that keep certain segments of the population from realizing

their aspirations. Most of all they limit the access of blacks and other

minorities to higher education."<p>



<p>



<p>



"Ninety million lives have been affected by data collected by the ETS,"

concluded Herndon, building toward a crescendo that brought a roar from the

crowd. "They're unaccountable to the political community, unaccountable to the

educational community, unaccountable to the legal community. Something must be

done!"<p>



<p>



<p>



The something in most minds that day was a national version of the "truth in

testing" law (a nickname the testing industry abhors) passed in New York State

last year. Under that law, students who take the SAT and similar tests in New

York this spring will, for the first time, receive corrected answer sheets and

copies of the test booklet a few months after the test date. This conference,

one of several organized by a group called Project DE-TEST (for DE-mystify The

Established Standardized Tests), was designed to build support for the efforts

of Democratic Representatives Shirley Chisholm, Theodore Weiss, and George

Miller to extend similar disclosure provisions nationwide.<p>



<p>



<p>



Even more, the speakers at that conference hoped for a basic challenge to the

role of standardized tests in American education. They are saying, in effect,

that the SAT--like the IQ tests that precede it in elementary school, and the

graduate school admissions tests that follow later on--is fundamentally unfair;

far from serving as agents of diversity and social mobility, such tests

reinforce and legitimize every inequality that now exists. As James Loewen, a

sociologist from Catholic University's Center for National Policy Review,

concluded, "standardized tests are the greatest single barrier to equal

opportunity, at least in the sphere of education." Such accusations, and the

vitriol behind them, have wounded and mystified those at the ETS. Several days

after the Washington conference, the ETS observers were back at headquarters,

stunned by what they had seen. They knew that such critics existed, but to hear

their work described that way was a heavy blow. In a side office, a secretary

transcribed a tape of Ralph Nader's latest blast at the ETS. From the tone of

his criticism, there could be no doubt: this was war.<p>



<p>



<p>



To the ETS, it is a particularly galling war, because it is an attack on the

company's point of greatest pride. Those who have shaped the testing industry

do not think of themselves as guardians of privilege; quite the reverse. They

are proud of the role they have played in opening up opportunities; secure in

that pride, they can understand the current criticism only as one more

manifestation of the mindless leveling impulses of the day. What else could

explain such hostility to the tool that seeks out talent wherever it may be

found? Why else does everyone hate us so?<p>



<p>



<p>



From the other side, Alan Nairn defines the challenge differently. For the last

five years, Nairn has been working for Ralph Nader on a study of the ETS due to

be published this spring; at twenty-four, he resembles in appearance and

intensity the Nader of twenty years past. "Social class is viewed as a sad fact

of life, but not an issue," he says. "The controversy over testing makes class

an issue."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



On a 400-acre tract of pleasant wooded land in Lawrenceville Township, a few

miles from Princeton, the professionals of the ETS develop the tests, study

their effects, and brood about challenges to their authority.<p>



<p>



<p>



The people at the ETS are not naive about testing, nor blind to the dark spots

in its past. Their profession is still a young one; the first IQ test was

developed less than a century ago. Modern "psychometricians" (which is what

those who test mental ability call themselves) know that, like other

still-emerging sciences, theirs had rough moments in its clumsy, infant days.

They know perfectly well that the first crude IQ tests were used mainly for

racial and ethnic exclusion. In 1912, on the basis of tests run at Ellis

Island, Henry Goddard scientifically proved that 83 percent of Jews were

"feebleminded," along with 90 percent of Hungarians, 79 percent of Italians,

and 81 percent of Russians (most of them Russian Jews). Modern ETS researchers

recall with sad smiles the miraculous finding, some years after the Ellis

Island tests, that Jews and Italians improved dramatically in intelligence

after they had lived in this country for a while, and that their children,

raised as English-speakers, seemed somehow to have been spared their parents'

feebleminded genes. At the ETS, they have seen drawings such as Figure I, which

is used in the current version of the Stanford Binet Intelligence Test for

elementary school children and which has now become practically a logo for

Project DE-TEST. They have heard the sample question from the Lorge-Thorndike

IQ test that John Weiss of Project DE-TEST uses to illustrate racial

stereotyping and bias in standardized tests:<p>



<p>



     When a dove begins to associate with crows, its feathers remain ______ but

its heart grows black.<p>



<p>



      A) Black B) White C) Dirty D) Spread E) Good<p>



<p>



<p>



For each outsider's story of a defective test, the insiders have a story of

their own. Winton Manning, a bearded, reflective man in his late forties who is

an ETS vice president and philosopher on matters of social equity, frequently

tells journalists the tale of the breech block test. During World War II, the

Navy evaluated breech block assemblers not by how quickly they could put a

breech block together but by their score on a written test about how it should

be done. We have seen it all, is the unspoken message of stories like this; we

have worked hard on our tests.<p>



<p>



<p>



They take most pride in the oldest and most famous test, the SAT, first

administered in 1926. Before that time, all College Board exams were essays;

the Board was established in 1900 to standardize the entrance exams that

Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and a few other elite universities had been

administering separately. The essay test and the multiple-choice SAT coexisted

until World War II, when the essay was suspended for the duration and never

resumed (except as a component in certain English proficiency exams). Hunter

Breland, an ETS research psychologist, explained that to get statistically

reliable results from an essay exam, students had to write five separate

essays, with five readers each. "We found we could do as well with fifty

multiple choice questions in a thirty-minute test," Breland said. "We got the

same people in the same order." When those fifty questions are expanded to a

full three-hour SAT, he said, you end up with a far better system than any

feasible essay test. This principle has been extended even to demonstrations of

writing skill. The old way of testing writing was to have the student write.

For the last five years, as part of the SAT, students have spent thirty minutes

on the Test of Standard Written English. It consists of multiple-choice

questions like the following, in which the student is asked to choose the best

phrasing for the underlined portion:<p>



<p>



     UNLESS THEY TAKE ACTION SOON, the world may face a power struggle for the

resources of the sea.<p>



<p>



A) Unless they take action<p>



B) Unless action is taken<p>



C) Unless action will be taken<p>



D) If it will not take action<p>



E) If action will not be taken<p>



<p>



<p>



(The "right" choice is B, nicely illustrating the ETS concept of the "best"

answer. None of the options is very good, and B is a lame passive; but bright

students are expected to pick it out as the "best" of a bad lot.)<p>



<p>



<p>



Another breakthrough toward test "efficiency"--finding the people you want with

fewer questions--came with the "quantitative comparison" section that has

replaced much of the mathematics portions of the SAT, the law examination, the

GRE, and other tests. Instead of being asked to compute answers, the students

are told to compare two items and see which is the larger. An example:<p>



<p>



     Number of minutes in 1 week.  Number of seconds in 7 hours<p>



<p>



<p>



The student is asked to mark A on the answer sheet if the quantity on the left

is larger, B if the quantity on the right is larger, C if they are equal, and D

if there is not enough information to tell. (The complexity of the answer

system makes some at the ETS feel that this section is vulnerable to coaching;

if you've seen this sort of question before, you are less likely to panic on

the test.)<p>



<p>



<p>



With "objective" tests seemingly necessary in practice and defensible in

theory, the ETS develops new ones all the time. The first step is to establish

the instruct validity" of the test--that is, whether what it measures has, at

face value, some connection to the purposes of the test. If it's a screening

device for potential lawyers, there should be some test of logical reasoning;

if it's screening future doctors, a test of the physical sciences. Unless it is

an achievement test, the questions are not supposed to measure outside

"knowledge," only how the students handle the information given them. The most

obvious exceptions to this are the word analogy and antonym sections of the SAT

and the GRE, which are essentially vocabulary tests. On the sample SAT passed

out by the company, the verbal section requires knowing words such as

"emanation," "aesthete," and "espouse"; the GRE includes "concatenation,"

"anodyne," and "preternatural."<p>



<p>



<p>



Questions are written by the ETS's own staff or by a sizable free-lance pool.

To get a better bargain for its money, the ETS has begun holding "item-writing

workshops" to teach its contributors the rules of the game. In early November,

I sat in on one of these workshops, conducted by Richard Evert, a young ETS

staffer with a professorial air. There were half-a-dozen free-lancers in the

room, all but one of them women. They were working on "Logical Reasoning"

questions from the LSAT. "It is important to remember that those taking the

test are a very bright population," Evert said as the session began, "whose

ablest members, though younger and less wise" (this with a smile) "are just as

good as any of us. It will tax your abilities to write difficult items--partly

because, as they work their way up through the review process, a lot of the

difficulty will be ground away."<p>



<p>



<p>



Among questions he discussed, some were thrown out for being too confusing in

their answers, others for lurking cultural or sexist bias ("Sir! You just spent

$3000 on your daughter's wedding and you are still drinking an ordinary vodka?

Now's the time for Tovarich"). The free-lancers were counseled not to be upset

if their questions were rejected, handed back to them with elaborate corrective

suggestions, or eviscerated of their trickiest parts as they made their way

through the in-house review. They were told that a special "minority"

representative would screen the questions for bias; they saw examples of

nit-picking comments from the endless reviewers and editors who look at each

question individually and then look once more at the overall mix of questions

on each new test. By the time a question makes its way to the final test form,

the ETS says, it will have been inspected nearly thirty times; the great

majority of questions will perish along the way. This is why, they say, it

takes eighteen months to prepare a new test, and why a full GRE or LSAT may

cost $100,000 or more to produce.<p>



<p>



<p>



For items that pass through this screening process, the most demanding standard

is still to come: their statistical performance on the "pretest." This step is

the heart of the ETS's claim for consistency in its tests; it is also the root

of one of the most basic complaints.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Every SAT is divided into six sections, five of which count for the student's

score. The sixth--which the student can't distinguish from the others--is made

up of new questions that have passed the in-house reviews and are ready for

use. As soon as the score sheets get back to Princeton and are sent through the

computerized scanners and scorers, statisticians work up response charts for

each of the new questions. These charts are long horizontal strips, divided

into six sections for the six possible answers to the question (A through E

plus "omit"). The chart shows how many students chose each possible answer, and

what the median score of those students was on the rest of the test. What the

ETS hopes to find, of course, is that those who chose the right answer (known

as the "key") had higher scores than those who did not; if so, the question

"works." If the question does not work--like the first one in Figure 2--it must

be changed. Sometimes the whole item must be junked; sometimes it can be saved,

by adjustments and rewording to make the key more obvious or the "distracters"

less tempting. Then it must be pretested again, until the statistics come out

right. The second question in Figure 2 shows an adjustment that made it

"work."<p>



<p>



<p>



The importance of this step can hardly be overstated. From the ETS's point of

view, the statistical pretest is essential; how else can it guarantee, year

after year, that the test will measure just the same things, in just the same

way? But this consistency also means that the ETS must be very sure that its

tests are measuring the right qualities, because their focus will never change.

If talents are diverse, if different groups display their abilities in

different ways, this process will never reveal it, because the standard set in

the beginning is the standard it retains.<p>



<p>



<p>



Even then the ETS's work is not done. There is the awkward but necessary

business of "ethnic studies," which means a comparison of black and white

scores, and correlations with different social and economic groups. There are

the endless instructions to colleges and graduate schools about how the tests

should be used. "A GRE test should be used only if its limitations are known,"

says the GRE handbook, in a typical warning. "A GRE test score should be used

as only one of several criteria, and should not be given undue weight solely

because it is convenient."<p>



<p>



<p>



By and large, these warnings are more necessary for graduate schools than for

colleges. One of the minor ironies of the testing controversy is that it occurs

during a relative lull in pressure for college admissions. Because there are

fewer college-age students than there were ten or fifteen years ago, and

because a smaller percentage of them apply to college, today's students have an

easier time of it. Lois D. Rice, a vice president of The College Board, is fond

of pointing out that 90 percent of all college-bound students are accepted by

the college of their choice; the argument about the SAT, she says, is really an

argument about who gets into a few such as Stanford and Yale. This glosses over

the fact that admission to the Stanfords and Yales still makes a difference;

more generally, her figures may be only a sign that the tracking system has

grown more refined.<p>



<p>



<p>



These days, the SAT's significance for college admissions is mainly to confirm

the judgments made by IQ and placement tests over the previous dozen years.

There is a close connection between scores on elementary school IQ tests and on

the SAT; indeed, recent research shows that tests in the fourth grade indicate

which students will go to college almost as reliably as the SAT does. By the

age of nine or ten, students are getting the picture about which of them will

be the lawyers and which the plumbers.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Graduate schools still feel the pressure of numbers, especially those that

control entry to lucrative professions such as law and medicine. Although

applications have swelled in the last decade, admissions staffs remain small.

As a result, many professional schools do end up using cutoff scores, and the

ETS experts consider this an abuse of their work. Winton Manning has put out a

policy paper explaining the difference between using test scores to determine

admissibility, which is good, and using them for selection, which is bad. Yale

Law School, for example, might decide that no one who scored below 500 on the

LSAT could handle the work; that, in Manning's view, would be fine. But many

big law and medical schools have more applicants than they can handle who score

over 700, and they end up choosing among students on the basis of scores alone,

accepting one at 740 and rejecting another at 710, even though the standard

measurement error of the test means that the difference between those scores

might be due entirely to chance.<p>



<p>



<p>



Manning and the others know these things happen; but that does not finally

undermine their faith in what they do, for their ideology and their life

experience combine to convince them of the value of their work. One critic of

the tests said he was first drawn to the subject because his grandparents,

Eastern European immigrants, arrived at Ellis Island just when many of their

countrymen were being pronounced feebleminded. William Angoff, an ETS vice

president who is the spiritual father of the SAT, has taken the opposite lesson

from life.<p>



<p>

Angoff is an urbane, silver-haired figure; when we met, he was wearing a blue

blazer, gray slacks, and a striped silk tie. He grew up in the tenements of

Boston, with his whole family chipping in to pay his way through school. He

went to Boston Latin, from there to Harvard, and on to eminence in the world of

psychometrics. " I consider that the tests have been a friend of American

society at all levels," Angoff says. "It certainly has been a boon to people

like me. It picks out people because of their individual likelihood to succeed.

The person who is going to do well on that test at Boston Latin is going to do

well on it anywhere else."<p>



<p>



<p>



With this assertion, the question is joined: Are the tests fair? William Angoff

is serene in his faith: "I believe that standardized tests have benefited

American education, and have benefited all the classes, as a very important

part of the American meritocratic philosophy." Among his colleagues, that

confidence is shared; people speak without irony of "our mission," and have no

doubt that the mission is the smoother, more just working of the

"meritocracy."<p>



<p>



<p>



Yet there are reasons to think their faith misplaced, their efforts, however

sincere, far more destructive than they imagine. The reasons begin with the

premises of the "meritocracy" whose cause they uphold.<p>



<p>



<p>



It is interesting to remember that when Michael Young, the British sociologist,

invented the term "meritocracy" twenty years ago, he did so with satirical

intent. His point was that a system of rewards based on "ability" and "merit"

would not necessarily be any fairer or more pleasant than other systems of

stratification the world has known. It would, he said, be a dull and dangerous

society, run by single-minded technicians. So deep has been the American hunger

for a "fair" system of classification, one based on ability rather than

accident of birth, that Young's term has been appropriated without its irony.<p>



<p>



<p>



The unspoken premises of our meritocracy are these:<p>



<p>



<p>



--That there is such a thing as "intelligence" or "ability," and that it can be

measured.<p>



<p>



<p>



--That intelligence matters. It counts for more than most human qualities and

provides the fairest proxy for "merit" in discriminating among people. It is

hateful to judge people by charm, lineage, beauty, wealth. There may be other

important qualities--honor, imagination-- but they are "soft"; intelligence is

quantifiable, "hard." Not incidentally, intelligence lends itself to objective

distinctions among large numbers of people.<p>



<p>



<p>



--That education is the engine of social progress, and intelligence is its

fuel. A fair--and self-interested-- society will give the best opportunities to

the most deserving candidates. The best students will go to the best schools,

where they will be trained for the highest responsibilities (for which they

will, in large measure, receive the highest rewards). By the same logic, it

makes sense to exclude, as early as possible, those who are not up to these

responsibilities, through predictive testing and academic "tracks."<p>



<p>



<p>



Whether or not they admit it, those who defend the tests are defending these

premises. Whether or not they know it, those who complain about the tests are

challenging the premises, beginning with the concept of measurable

intelligence.<p>



<p>



<p>



Like most modern psychometrician ETS officials are careful to say, when

speaking for the record, that native intelligence is not what their tests are

designed to detect. Indeed, the main SAT fact sheet says that it is a "test of

developed ability, not of innate intelligence; a test of abilities that are

developed slowly over time both through in-school and out-of-school

experience." They say it with feeling, and on one level I am sure they believe

it. But they clearly believe something contrary, too, if they are sincere--and

they are--in their claims that the tests serve as agents of the meritocracy.

They believe that the tests measure something fundamental. One does not have to

call it intelligence. Call it smarts, or the right stuff. By whatever name, it

is a notion of intrinsic worth. How else could the tests be presumed to

identify the promising lad from the Boston slums and propel him upward through

Boston Latin and Harvard? How else could they provide a means of comparing a

sixth-former at St. Paul's with a senior at Muncie High? How else could they be

good for "all the classes" in America? The test-makers seemingly want it both

ways: they want to speak with scientific decorum about the limits of their

work, and they want to say, We have the best tool for judging people

objectively. Alan Nairn puts the paradox this way: "With all the disclaimers,

they are in effect saying that this is so important a piece of information, so

terribly revealing about the student, that it must be handled with great

care."<p>



<p>



<p>



I have yet to meet a high school student who did not take the tests as a

measure of how "smart" he was. Students were not allowed to see their own SAT

scores until 1958. Frank Bowles, president of The College Board when that

decision was made, was prescient about its effects. He said in 1960: "There was

great fear that students would have their values warped by learning their own

scores, but I have learned from hearing my own children's conversations that

SAT scores have now become one of the peer group measuring devices. One

unfortunate may be dismissed with the phrase, 'That jerk--he only made 420!'

The bright, steady student is appreciated with his high 600, and the

unsuspected genius with his 700 is held in awe."<p>



<p>



<p>



"I have spent time among people at the pinnacle of the meritocracy," says one

test expert, "with people who can dissect very rationally all the shortcomings

of the tests. But they'll say, 'That guy's really smart--he got 800s on his

SAT's.'" Of the sixty-odd people I spoke with while preparing this article,

exactly one volunteered his SAT score--a friend who has made a reputation as an

analyst and writer. He scored in the mid-300s, felt crushed by the experience,

and finally found his way into college on his swimming skills.<p>



<p>



<p>



Nearly everyone else said something like, "Of course, I did very well on the

tests myself," in the same tone a millionaire might use in saying, "Of course,

my family had some money." To say just how much would be bragging; but to leave

any doubt about the general picture would be worse.<p>



<p>



<p>



And this is only the effect on those who succeed: the real damage is to those

who are taught to expect to fail. Record amounts of mail poured in to the

National Education Association, the teachers' organization, after two articles

by Arlene Silberman appeared, in Reader's Digest and McCall's, about the way

children were taught to think of themselves as "ordinary" or "slow average"

because of elementary school IQ tests. This wounding effect is compounded by a

statistical quirk of the test. Common sense would suggest that, if a scale runs

from 200 to 800, 500 would be the "average" score. Indeed it was, forty years

ago, when the statistical norms for the SAT were established and 500 was set as

the median score. But as times have changed and the sample of students taking

the test has grown less select, the median has dropped nearly 100 points; these

days, only about one quarter of all students score above 500 on the test. The

other three quarters think they are "below average." At any one time, 75

percent of all teenagers probably also think that they are below average in

popularity, resistance to acne, or development of secondary sex traits. These

things pass, or most of them do; the verdict on intelligence remains.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The ETS's long denial that coaching could affect scores illustrates its

conviction that the tests plumb innate capabilities. The test-coaching dispute

has been the subject of numerous articles (the best of them, although hotly

contested by the ETS, is Stephen Levy's "ETS and the Coaching Cover-up," in the

March 1979 issue of New Jersey Monthly) and promises to occupy lawyers and

researchers for years, but its central point is simple. Any fool can look at

one of the tests and see that preparation has to make a difference. The verbal

sections of the tests are not only loaded with vocabulary but also contain

obscure kinds of items likely to confuse or panic those who have not seen them

before. One example is the "data evaluation" section of the LSAT, which

consists of a long passage describing a business decision followed by up to

twenty separate elements, each of which the student must identify as "Major

Objective," "Major Factor," "Minor Factor," "Major Assumption," or "Unimportant

Issue." The mathematical portions penalize those who have not brushed up on

high school algebra and geometry. During the early 1970s, several versions of

the LSAT included questions based on a "triangle chart" like the ones in Figure

3. From the information given, the student would be asked questions such as,

"What was the average number of men per city who preferred home improvements?"

Once the chart has been explained, it is a snap. Without that explanation, most

people are left to guesswork and blind luck.<p>



<p>



<p>



The ETS more or less admits all this now. Its newly released handbook for the

law school exam says that "vocabulary cards and exercises, in addition to

extensive reading with the help of a dictionary, will be useful" for certain

parts of the test. Its publications now instruct students in test-taking

strategy--for example, that it always makes sense to guess if you can narrow

the answer down to two or three possibilities. But until very recently, the ETS

could not bring itself to admit such a thing. It defined coaching as

last-minute cramming, said such hasty efforts would do no good, and extended

the judgment to a blanket assertion that special preparation for the tests "is

likely to yield insignificant increases in scores."<p>



<p>



<p>



Why such resistance to such a self-evident truth? Most likely it is because

coaching, if effective, threatens to upset the whole applecart, by suggesting

that what the tests measure can be fairly quickly changed. If the whole subject

were less heated, this finding would not be surprising. One year of high

school, with its courses in algebra and English, is expected to increase test

scores, so why shouldn't a six-month coaching course have a similar effect?

Stanley Kaplan, founder of one of the most popular chains of coaching schools,

often says that parents pay him several hundred dollars to do what the public

schools should be doing--and that schools such as Exeter and Andover are just

grander versions of the same idea.<p>



<p>



<p>



Coaching also undermines the foundations of the tests from another direction.

If courses can be designed for the specific purpose of increasing scores on the

tests, does that not suggest that the tests reveal, rather than "aptitude" or

"achievement," only mastery of an unusual and specialized system of thought?

Since long before the current testing controversy, the ETS and its allies have

fought a running battle against those who claim test scores are poor indicators

of "merit" because of the limits inherent in both the format and the content of

the tests.<p>



<p>



<p>



Nearly twenty years ago, a mathematics professor at Queen's College named

Banesh Hoffmann published a book entitled The Tyranny of Testing; his argument

was that multiple-choice tests reveal nothing about the student's reasoning and

penalize those with complex or creative styles of thought. One example, taken

not from Hoffman but from an official testing manual, is shown in Figure 4. The

manual explains why D is the answer to the first question and H is the answer

to the second. But what about the student who sees, in the first question, that

the first three figures are alike in being four-sided figures with no right

angles, and chooses E as the only appropriate answer? Or who sees, in the

second question, that the first three figures are all isosceles triangles, and

that F is the only isosceles triangle among the answers? That student will get

the question wrong, and have a lower IQ, unless he is enough of an old hand at

multiple-choice tests to know the kind of obvious thinking the test-writers are

usually looking for. "Sometimes you hear of very bright students who do poorly

on these tests," says David Riesman of Harvard. "They don't exactly fail them,

but their scores are not as spectacular as they should be. All you have to tell

them is that the questions are designed for l'homme moyen sensuel, that they

should take it at face value. Then they do fine."<p>



<p>



<p>



While visiting the ETS, I spent evenings in my hotel room with a stopwatch on

the table and a No. 2 pencil in hand, taking sample versions of the SAT, LSAT,

and GRE. Six or eight times in the verbal portion of each test, I found

questions with the same problem as the one in Figure 4: there were two or three

plausible answers, depending on the logical course one chose. In most cases, it

was easy enough to guess the "right" answer--not by means of superior logic,

but by knowing the way the ETS thinks. Of all the forms of test bias, this may

be the most insidious and deepest rooted: the shared assumptions about which

logic is "compelling" and which merely "superficial," assumptions that derive

from the social experiences that shape judgment and taste. ETS officials winced

at the suggestion that there was a system to their thought, but any veteran

test-taker recognizes it. Recently a young law school graduate, his life story

an unbroken series of successes on ETS exams, began boning up for the bar exam

while finishing his clerkship at the Supreme Court. "My self-confidence went up

50 percent," he said, "when I discovered that the Multi-State Bar is an ETS

exam."<p>



<p>



<p>



The complaint against multiple-choice tests is based less on their neglect of

individual genius than on their bias against larger groups. This is the heart

of the case against testing. For all its other claims, the testing industry

finally rests its defense on "equity." The tests were created to broaden the

pool of talent open to the colleges, and that is what the testers say they

still do. When they've finished with the disclaimers, the stipulations about

"developed ability" and "limited predictive validity," when they lean back and

talk about the meaning of it all, most of them speak as William Angoff does.

The tests have been a friend to all classes. The system works. If their case

were true, it would excuse most other defects in the test. But it is impossible

to ignore the evidence that, in most instances, the tests simply ratify earlier

advantage--that, as engines of mobility, they have sputtered and died.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Through all the controversies of the last decade about inherent racial

differences in intelligence, many black groups have concluded that standardized

tests are the latest attempt to deny them what they deserve. Black

psychologists' associations have called for a flat moratorium on standardized

tests; a journal called Measuring Cup, published in Savannah, reports on tests

from the black point of view. James Loewen of Catholic University, who is

white, has devised questions like the following (modified from Robert

Williams's Black Intelligence Test of Cultural Homogeneity, or BITCH), which

test "verbal aptitude and reasoning," but are based on black vocabulary.<p>



<p>



Saturday Ajax got an LD:<p>



A) He had smoked too much grass<p>



B) He tripped out on drugs<p>



C) He brought her to his apartment<p>



D) He showed it off to his fox<p>



E) He became "wised up" (less dense)<p>



<p>



<p>



 Once you know that an LD is a Cadillac Eldorado, the reasoning can begin;

without that, it's hard to make a start. Loewen spent several years in the

1970s teaching at Tougaloo, a primarily black college in Mississippi, and

concluded that the SAT and the Graduate Record Exam were major practical and

psychological barriers to his students. Students who performed well in his

classes scored in the mid-400s on the GRE; his very top student got a 565. "We

learned to help some students develop reasons why they had not taken the GRE,"

Loewen told a congressional committee considering the "truth in testing" bill

last fall, because "some schools found it possible to waive the GRE requirement

for a believable excuse, while they would not have overlooked a 400 score."<p>



<p>



<p>



Loewen went on to make a fundamental point: that the tests are not fair

national standards of comparison. Without one nationwide test, the test

designers say, how can you compare the boy from Boston with the girl from Grand

Forks? "A GRE score of 500," the GRE booklet claims, "has the same meaning

whether earned by a student from a small private liberal arts college or a

student at a large public university." This is precisely what Loewen denies,

calling it a "statement of arrogance." "If you have two kids who get 500," he

says, "one from Harvard and one from Tougaloo, you know that one of them is

pretty dumb, and it's the one from Harvard."<p>



<p>



<p>



The bias is not racial so much as economic, and the overall point is so bald

that it can hardly be ignored. College Board data showed this relationship

between economic standing and test performance in 1974:<p>



<p>



Student's Score  Student's Mean Family Income<p>



     750-800            $24,124<p>



     700-749              21,980<p>



     650-699              21,292<p>



     600-649              20,330<p>



     550-599              19,481<p>



     500-549              18,824<p>



     450-499              18,122<p>



     400-449              17,387<p>



     350-399              16,182<p>



     300-349              14,355<p>



     250-299              11,428<p>



     200-249                8,639<p>



<p>



<p>



Loewen has compared the median incomes of the fifty states and the District of

Columbia with the National Merit Scholarship "cutoff score" for each state.

(Scholarships are awarded on the basis of scores on the Preliminary Scholastic

Aptitude Test, which is usually given in the junior year. Because National

Merit does not want all its scholarships going to Connecticut and New Jersey,

it sets a different cutoff score for each state.) "Connecticut has the highest

cutoff, and Mississippi the lowest," Loewen says. "It is intriguing to note

that Connecticut is the richest state in the nation, and Mississippi the

poorest." All in all, he says, his list and The College Board's match

perfectly; there is a .83 correlation between them--about as close a

relationship as statisticians ever expect to find.<p>



<p>



<p>



These patterns strongly suggest that what the tests measure is exposure to

upper middle class culture--perhaps even the culture of the professional class

of the east coast. (Is it entirely a coincidence, Loewen asks, that scores on

the American College Testing Exam, written in Iowa City, are consistently

better predictors of performance for students from all backgrounds than the ETS

tests written on the outskirts of Princeton?) Whatever the reason, the findings

simply blow apart the original precepts of the tests. One can of course argue

that intelligence is hereditary, as in part it is, and that intelligence earns

money, as to some extent it does. But these general tendencies do not explain

the lockstep correlation between parental income and student scores. Unless one

is willing to set aside the evidence of daily life and conclude that all smart

people are rich, these results can mean only one thing: that standardized

tests, created to offset one kind of privilege, have merely enshrined a

different kind. The tests measure something, probably something of value--but

whatever it is, it's clearly a symptom of social advantage.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Tests may measure aptitude of achievement within populations that share

backgrounds," Loewen says, "but they do not measure accurately across

backgrounds." To illustrate, he prepared the "Loewen Low Aptitude Test," which

is "designed to show my urbane white students some of the forms of test bias

and to give them the experience of 'flunking' an aptitude test." Here is one of

its questions:<p>



<p>



Spline is to mitre as _____is to ____. <p>



a) love . . . marriage <p>



b) straw . . . mud <p>



c) key . . . lock <p>



d) bond . . . bail <p>



e) bond . . . paper<p>



<p>



<p>



The question is biased toward the working class, toward students whose

"exposure" would have taught them that a spline is a small piece of wood

inserted to keep a mortise joint tight. From there, reasoning takes

over--spline adds strength to a mitre as straw adds strength to mud. (If you

chose "love . . . marriage," you have not grasped the concept of the "best"

answer. "Sometimes one answer will be 65 percent right, and the 'distracter'

will be 60 percent right," one test designer explained. "The first one's the

'best' answer--but the distracter would be best if the other were removed."

Here, any SAT veteran should recognize "straw . . . mud" as the "best" because,

like "spline . . . mitre," it is tangible, not abstract.)<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



There is an annoying trick element to questions like this, but the argument

behind them is sound. If the meritocracy's aim is to reveal talent, shouldn't

we strive for ways to transcend boundaries of upbringing and taste? Is there

not some way to avoid falling into the mushiness of saying that Black English

is "just as good" as standard English, or that "all forms of learning are

equally valid," yet still discover able people who grew up knowing more about

splines than about concatenations? As a first step, shouldn't the ETS system of

selecting questions be turned on its head? Instead of choosing new questions

because they will yield exactly the same results as the old, the testers should

deliberately look for questions that break the pattern--not because they want

everybody to get the same score, but because people from different backgrounds

should have a chance to display their reasoning skills. It has been done

before. The first widely used American version of the IQ test showed that, in

native intelligence, women were significantly weaker than men. When the test

was restandardized in the 1930s, one of the specifications was that men and

women should get equally high scores. This involved, among other things,

removing sports-knowledge questions from the test, and inserting others on

which women did particularly well. Is it so outrageous to contemplate

additional test items on which able poor or black children would excel?<p>



<p>



<p>



Many professors look with horror on such a dilution of the tests. It is the

levelers at work, they say: if these standards fall, nothing else will stand.

"If people are underprepared for tests, they will generally be underprepared

for courses," says David Riesman; he makes the logical point that a university

cannot do its business without students qualified to meet its standards. "Good

God," said one of my former professors when I mentioned the subject to him.

"Students have little enough asked of them as it is. Few enough real standards

to meet. It can only be worse if the everybody-is-equal view takes over."<p>



<p>



<p>



True, many in the anti-testing movement abhor standards of all kinds--any

distinction, any measurement, any judgment that might make somebody feel bad.

But one need not be among their number to feel uneasy about the tests and the

meritocratic philosophy they represent. It is self-evident that not everyone is

suited for freshman work at Harvard or at any other college. Not everyone

should be a doctor. Some were born without the potential; others were ill

prepared along the way. The universities do have standards of scholarship to

protect.<p>



<p>



<p>



	In a way, the universities have been unfairly trapped by a myth--the myth of

themselves as the forces for social change. The ultimate meritocratic

justification for selective education is that this privilege will go to the

most deserving, who will be better trained for their future responsibilities,

and who will provide surer, wiser leadership for all mankind. But most

sociological studies show that education does not work this way at all. The

amount of education you get makes a difference in success in later life, but

performance in school doesn't (except by entitling you to spend more years in

school). Instead of selecting and training leaders, education certifies them to

hold positions of privilege. This confusion between the academic role of

education and its role as a granter of credentials may be the biggest threat to

academic standards of all. It leads to grade-grubbing, demands for "fair

admissions," and a view of liberal education as nothing snore than a ticket to

business school.<p>



<p>



<p>



The testers are aware of these complaints. But what, they say, do you expect us

to do? "It would be tempting to say that the schools should be looking about to

find the people who will make the greatest contributions to society in their

occupations and professions," says William Turnbull. But the schools have asked

the ETS to help with a more limited task, selecting "those who are ready for

the next step."<p>



<p>



<p>



The proper challenge to testing is to accept a higher modesty, one that begins

with the understanding that this "merit" system pretends to more fairness than

it delivers. All systems of selection are unfair; all are tempted to claim too

much justice for their results. We recognize this about previous systems but

are reluctant to face it in our own. Once that fact is recognized, it may be

possible to think again about the proper building blocks of a

meritocracy--measures that do not seal fate at an early age, that emphasize

performance in specific areas, that expand the pool of talent in more than a

hit-or-miss way, and whose limits are always visible to us, so that we are not

again deluded into thinking we have found a scientific basis for the order of

lords, vassals, and serfs.</blockquote><p>

	<B>glass-tower people</B> <i>plural noun</i>, the professional and managerial members
of the U.S. upper middle class, who are college-educated, economically
ascendant, and sophisticated to the extent that they understand and encourage
change and cultural diversity. Also called <i>the have-mores</i>: "The middle
class, long the balance wheel of American society, is beginning to fissure
along fault lines of income, values and lifestyle. It is cleaving into <i>the
have-mores--</i>'the <i>glass-tower people</i>,' Labor Secretary Robert Reich
calls them--and the have-lesses" (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>).<p>
	
	Background: <i>Glass-tower people</i>--a term with obvious links to <i>ivory
tower</i>--joins a small but growing lexicon of class conflict. Some
established examples are <i>cultural elites</i> and <i>angry white males</i>.
Less well known terms include <i>unearned advantage</i> (or <i>unearned
privilege</i>), <i>skin-color privilege</i>, and <i>male privilege</i>,
expressions used by Peggy McIntosh, a philosopher of education at Wellesley
College, to point up the social stratification that race, sex, and class can
create.<p>
<pre>

</pre>
	
	<B>human bowling</B> <i>noun</i>, a form of entertainment in which players roll a
round steel-mesh cage into which a person has been strapped down a padded
runway in an attempt to knock down six heavy, oversized pins at the end:
"Alcohol- and drug-free parties have followed proms and graduations for years,
but movies and bingo look pretty tame compared to today's gigs that run more
than $10,000 in wealthier suburbs. The same boys and girls who once were
entertained with birthday party magicians now look forward to bungee runs and
Velcro walls, sumo wrestling and <i>human bowling</i>, all between 1 a.m. and 5
a.m." (<i>Washington Post</i>).<p>
	
	Background: <i>Human bowling</i>, virtual-reality games, and various
<i>inflatable activities</i>--such as bungee runs and <i>gladiator
jousting</i>, which are held on inflatable surfaces--are catching on as
after-prom entertainment intended to keep students sober and off the roads.
Many high school students are now spending more money on their after-prom
parties than on the proms themselves, sometimes beginning fundraising
activities as early as freshman year. Parties are often spiced up with prizes
that have been donated by corporations or parents, such as small television
sets, microwave ovens, and dorm refrigerators. <p>
<pre>

</pre>
	
	<B>MacGyver bomb</B> <i>noun</i>, <i>slang</i>, an explosive device consisting of a
plastic or glass bottle filled with volatile household chemicals and then
capped, which explodes either on impact or from a buildup of internal pressure.
Also called <i>bottle bomb</i>; <i>chemical bomb</i>; <i>soda-bottle bomb</i>;
<i>two-liter bomb</i>. "'I've run across <i>MacGyver bombs</i> for a couple
[of] years now and made some arrests,' [Taylorville, Ill.,
arson-and-bomb-squad investigator Richard] Sutton said" (Springfield, Ill.,
<i>State Journal-Register</i>).<p>
	
	Background: This term was coined in association with the 1985-1991 television
action drama <i>MacGyver</i>, whose protagonist used household products to
jury-rig all manner of devices, including bombs (no complete recipe for which
was aired). The term has appeared in print since at least 1992, in descriptions
of numerous incidents, usually mailbox bombings, perpetrated by teenagers.<p>
<pre>

</pre>
	
	<B>trash cover</B> <i>noun</i>, the clandestine removal and analysis, and sometimes
the return, of all or some of the household refuse of a suspect in any type of
investigation, such as one involving espionage, organized crime, drugs, or
counterterrorism, in order to acquire evidence or to draw a personal profile:
"[FBI agent Leslie G. Wiser Jr.] said he initiated the September [1993]
<i>trash cover </i>[of then-CIA officer Aldrich H. Ames] because his team was
'depressed and upset' that Ames had eluded them the previous
week" (<i>Washington Post</i>).<p>
	
	Background: After the Federal Bureau of Investigation's elite Special
Surveillance Group swiftly removed Ames's trash can in the dark of night and
substituted a look-alike, it retrieved a penciled draft of a note Ames had
attached to secret documents he had recently turned over to the Russians.
According to David Major, a retired FBI supervisory special agent and a former
director of counterintelligence at the National Security Council, <i>trash
covers </i>are used by private investigators and corporate sleuths engaged in
"competitive intelligence" as well as by law-enforcement officers. A targeted
person's refuse can yield the names of banks, the names and addresses of
friends and acquaintances, and clues to an individual's personal behavior.
Though the term has been a fixture in law-enforcement jargon for many years, it
is rarely seen in general contexts.<p>

In the September, 1971, Atlantic, R. J. Herrnstein summarized theposition of psychologists and others who believe that heredity is substantiallymore important than environment in determining intelligence, as measured by IQtests. In its issue of December, 1971, The Atlantic published a number ofletters (the correspondents included sociologists, anthropologists, economists,educators, and a few psychologists) taking issue with Professor Herrnstein'sarticle. Many of those who wrote maintained that environmental factors, ratherthan any genetic deficit, explain the poor performance of lower-classinner-city children.<p><p><p>A third position held by linguists and many anthropologists locates the problemnot in the children, but in the relations between them and the school system.This position holds that inner-city children do not necessarily have inferiormothers, language, or experience, but that the language, family style, and waysof living of inner-city children are significantly different from the standardculture of the classroom, and that this difference is not always properlyunderstood by teachers and psychologists. Linguists believe that we must beginto adapt our school system to the language and learning styles of the majorityin the inner-city schools. They argue that everyone has the right to learn thestandard languages and culture in reading and writing (and speaking, if theyare so inclined); but this is the end result, not the beginning of theeducational process. They do not believe that the standard language is the onlymedium in which teaching and learning can take place, or that the first step ineducation is to convert all first-graders to replicas of white middle-classsuburban children.<p><p><p>This article grew out of my own attempt to state the linguistic position onthese issues at a Georgetown Round Table in 1968. While psychologists areobviously divided, linguists find (somewhat to their own surprise) that theyall agree. My own statement here is based on research carried out in SouthCentral Harlem from 1965 to 1968 by a team of two white and two blackinvestigators, supported by the Office of Education. Our aim was to describethe differences between the standard English of the classroom and thevernacular language used by members of the street culture. We carried outlong-term participant-observation with a number of black adolescent peergroups: the Jets, the Cobras, the Thunderbirds, the Aces, the Oscar Brothers.Their dialect will be referred to below as the Black English Vernacular (BEV).It is a remarkably consistent grammar, essentially the same as that found inother cities: Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, San Francisco, LosAngeles, New Orleans. It is important to note that this Black EnglishVernacular is only a small part of what might be called "Black English." BlackAmericans do not, of course, speak a single dialect, but a wide range oflanguage forms that cover the continuum between this vernacular and the mostformal literary English. --W. L.</i> </b></font><p><p><br> <p> <br><font size=5>I</font><font size=3>n the past decade, a great deal of federally sponsored research has beendevoted to the educational problems of children in ghetto schools. To accountfor the poor performance of children in these schools, educationalpsychologists have tried to discover what kind of disadvantage or defect thechildren are suffering from. The viewpoint which has been widely accepted andused as the basis for large-scale intervention programs is that the childrenshow a cultural deficit as a result of an impoverished environment in theirearly years. A great deal of attention has been given to language. In thisarea, the deficit theory appears as the notion of "verbal deprivation": blackchildren from the ghetto area are said to receive little verbal stimulation, tohear very little well-formed language, and as a result are impoverished intheir means of verbal expression. It is said that they cannot speak completesentences, do not know the names of common objects, cannot form concepts orconvey logical thoughts.<p><p><p><p><p><p>Unfortunately, these notions are based upon the work of educationalpsychologists who know very little about language and even less about blackchildren. The concept of verbal deprivation has no basis in social reality; infact, black children in the urban ghettos receive a great deal of verbalstimulation, hear more well-formed sentences than middle-class children, andparticipate fully in a highly verbal culture; they have the same basicvocabulary, possess the same capacity for conceptual learning, and use the samelogic as anyone else who learns to speak and understand English. The myth ofverbal deprivation is particularly dangerous because it diverts the attentionfrom real defects of our educational system to imaginary defects of the child;and as we shall see, it leads its sponsors inevitably to the hypothesis of thegenetic inferiority of black children, which the verbal-deprivation theory wasdesigned to avoid.<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>The deficit theory attempts to account for a number of facts that are known toall of us: that black children in the central urban ghettos do badly on allschool subjects, including arithmetic and reading. In reading, they averagemore than two years behind the national norm. Furthermore, this lag iscumulative, so that they do worse comparatively in the fifth grade than in thefirst grade. The information available suggests that this bad performance iscorrelated most closely with socioeconomic status. Segregated ethnic groups,however, seem to do worse than others: in particular, Indian, Mexican-American,and black children.<p><p><p><p><p><p>We are obviously dealing with the effects of the caste system of Americansociety--essentially a "color-marking" system. Everyone recognizes this. Thequestion is, By what mechanism does the color bar prevent children fromlearning to read? One answer is the notion of "cultural deprivation" putforward by Martin Deutsch and others: the black children are said to lack thefavorable factors in their home environment which enable middle-class childrento do well in school. These factors involve the development, through verbalinteraction with adults, of various cognitive skills, including the ability toreason abstractly, to speak fluently, and to focus upon long-range goals. Intheir publications, the psychologists Deutsch, Irvin Katz, and Arthur Jensenalso recognize broader social factors. However, the deficit theory does notfocus upon the interaction of the black child with white society so much as onhis failure to interact with his mother at home. In the literature we find verylittle direct observation of verbal interaction in the black home: mosttypically, the investigators ask the child if he has dinner with his parents,and if he engages in dinner-table conversation with them. He is also askedwhether his family takes him on trips to museums and other cultural activities.This slender thread of evidence is used to explain and interpret the large bodyof tests carried out in the laboratory and in the school.<p><p><p><p><p><p>The most extreme view which proceeds from this orientation--and one that is nowbeing widely accepted--is that lower-class black children have no language atall. Some educational psychologists first draw from the writings of the Britishsocial psychologist Basil Bernstein the idea that "much of lower-class languageconsists of a kind of incidental 'emotional accompaniment' to action here andnow." Bernstein's views are filtered through a strong bias against all forms ofworking-class behavior, so that he sees middle-class language as superior inevery respect--as "more abstract, and necessarily somewhat more flexible,detailed and subtle." One can proceed through a range of such views until onecomes to the practical program of Carl Bereiter, Siegfried Engelmann, and theirassociates. Bereiter's program for an academically oriented preschool is basedupon the premise that black children must have a language which they can learn,and their empirical findings that these children come to school without such alanguage. In his work with four-year-old black children from Urbana, Illinois,Bereiter reports that their communication was by gestures, "single words," and"a series of badly connected words or phrases," such as They mine and Me gotjuice. He reports that black children could not ask questions, that "withoutexaggerating...these four-year-olds could make no statements of any kind."Furthermore, when these children were asked, "Where is the book?" they did notknow enough to look at the table where the book was lying in order to answer.Thus Bereiter concludes that the children's speech forms are nothing more thana series of emotional cries. and he decides to treat them "as if the childrenhad no language at all." He identifies their speech with his interpretation ofBernstein's restricted code: "The language of culturally deprived children...isnot merely an underdeveloped version of standard English, but is a basicallynon-logical mode of expressive behavior." The basic program of his preschool isto teach them a new language devised by Engelmann, which consists of a limitedseries of questions and answers such as Where is the squirrel? / The squirrelis in the tree. The children will not be punished if they use their vernacularspeech on the playground, but they will not be allowed to use it in theschoolroom. If they should answer the question "Where is the squirrel?" withthe illogical vernacular form "In the tree," they will be reprehended byvarious means and made to say, "The squirrel is in the tree."<p><p><p><p><p><p>Linguists and psycholinguists who have worked with black children are likely todismiss this view of their language as utter nonsense. Yet there is no reasonto reject Bereiter's observations as spurious: they were certainly not made up.On the contrary they give us a very clear view of the behavior of student andteacher which can be duplicated in any classroom. Our own research is doneoutside the schools, in situations where adults are not the dominant force, buton many occasions we have been asked to help analyze the results of researchinto verbal deprivation in such test situations.<p><p><p><p><p><p>Here, for example. is a complete interview with a black boy, one of hundredscarried out in a New York City school. The boy enters a room where there is alarge, friendly white interviewer, who puts on the table in front of him ablock or a fire engine, and says, "Tell me everything you can about this!" (Theinterviewer's further remarks are in parentheses.)<p><p><p><p>[12 seconds of silence]<p><p><p><p>(What would you say it looks like?)<p><p><p><p>[8 seconds of silence]<p><p><p><p>A spaceship.<p><p><p><p>(Hmmmmm.)<p><p><p><p>[13 seconds of silence]<p><p><p><p>Like a je-et.<p><p><p><p>[12 seconds of silence]<p><p><p><p>Like a plane.<p><p><p><p>[20 seconds of silence]<p><p><p><p>(What color is it?)<p><p><p><p>Orange.

Who do you think would like to have it?)<p><p><p><p>[10 seconds of silence]<p><p><p><p>Cla-rence.<p><p><p><p>(Mm. Where do you think we could get another one of these?)<p><p><p><p>At the store. <p><p><p><p>(Oh-ka-ay!)<p><p><p><p><p><p>We have here the same kind of defensive, monosyllabic behavior which isreported in Bereiter's work. What is the situation that produces it? The childis in an asymmetrical situation where anything he says can, literally, be heldagainst him. He has learned a number of devices to avoid saying anything inthis situation, and he works very hard to achieve this end. <p><p><p><p><p><p>If one takes this interview as a measure of the verbal capacity of the child,it must be as his capacity to defend himself in a hostile and threateningsituation. But unfortunately, thousands of such interviews are used as evidenceof the child's total verbal capacity, or more simply his verbality: it isargued that this lack of "verbality" explains his poor performance in school.<p><p><p><p><p><p>The verbal behavior which is shown by the child in the test situation quotedabove is not the result of ineptness of the interviewer. It is rather theresult of regular sociolinguistic factors operating upon adult and child inthis asymmetrical situation. In our work in urban ghetto areas, we have oftenencountered such behavior. For over a year Clarence Robins had worked with theThunderbirds, a group of boys ten to twelve years old who were the dominantpreadolescent group in a low-income project in Harlem. We then decided tointerview a few younger brothers of the Thunderbirds, eight to nine years old.But our old approach didn't work. Here is an extract from the interview betweenClarence and eight-year-old Leon L.:<p><p><p><p><p><p>CR: What if you saw somebody kickin' somebody else on the ground, or was usinga stick, what would you do if you saw that?<p><p><p><p>LEON: Mmmm.<p><p><p><p>CR: If it was supposed to be a fair fight--<p><p><p><p>LEON: I don' know.<p><p><p><p>CR: You don' know? Would you do anything?...huh? I can't hear you.<p><p><p><p>LEON: No.<p><p><p><p>CR: Did you ever see somebody get beat up real bad?<p><p><p><p>LEON: ...Nope ???<p><p><p><p>CR: Well--uh did you ever get into a fight with a guy?<p><p><p><p>LEON: Nope.<p><p><p><p>CR: That was bigger than you?<p><p><p><p>LEON: Nope.<p><p><p><p>CR: You never been in a fight?<p><p><p><p>LEON: Nope.<p><p><p><p>CR: Nobody ever pick on you? <p><p><p><p>LEON: Nope.<p><p><p><p>CR: Nobody ever hit you?<p><p><p><p>LEON: Nope.<p><p><p><p>CR: How come?<p><p><p><p>LEON: Ah 'on' know.<p><p><p><p>CR: Didn't you ever hit somebody?<p><p><p><p>LEON: Nope.<p><p><p><p>CR: [incredulous] You never hit nobody?<p><p><p><p>LEON: Mhm.<p><p><p><p>CR: Aww, ba-a-a-be, you ain't gonna tell me that.<p><p><p><p><p><p>This nonverbal behavior occurs in a relatively favorable context foradult-child interaction, since the adult is a black man raised in Harlem, whoknows this particular neighborhood and these boys very well. He is a skilledinterviewer who has obtained a very high level of verbal response withtechniques developed for a different age level, and has an extraordinaryadvantage over most teachers or experimenters in these respects. But even hisskills and personality are ineffective in breaking down the social constraintsthat prevail here.<p><p><p>When we reviewed the record of this interview with Leon. we decided to use itas a test of our own knowledge of the sociolinguistic factors which controlspeech. We made the following changes in the social situation; in the nextinterview with Leon, Clarence:<p><p><p><p>     1. Brought along a supply of potato chips, changing the "interview" intosomething more in the nature of a party.<p><p><p><p>     2. Brought along Leon's best friend, eight-year-old Gregory.<p><p><p><p>     3. Reduced the height imbalance. When Clarence got down on the floor ofLeon's room, he dropped from 6 feet, 2 inches to 3 feet, 6 inches.<p><p><p><p>     4. Introduced taboo words and taboo topics, and proved to Leon's surprisethat one can say anything into our microphone without any fear of retaliation.It did not hit or bite back. The result of these changes is a strikingdifference in the volume and style of speech.<p><p><p><p><p><p>[The tape is punctuated throughout by the sound<p><p>of potato chips. ]<p><p><p><p>CR: Is there anybody who says.

I'm sayin' the po'k chop God! He only a po'kchop God! [Leon chuckles]<p><p><p><p><p><p>The "nonverbal" Leon is now competing actively for the floor; Gregory and Leontalk to each other as much as they do to the interviewer. The monosyllabicspeaker who had nothing to say about anything and could not remember what hedid yesterday has disappeared. Instead, we have two boys who have so much tosay that they keep interrupting each other, who seem to have no difficulty inusing the English language to express themselves.<p><p><p><p>One can now transfer this demonstration of the sociolinguistic control ofspeech to other test situations, including IQ and reading tests in school. Itshould be immediately apparent that none of the standard tests will comeanywhere near measuring Leon's verbal capacity. On these tests he will show upas very much the monosyllabic, inept, ignorant, bumbling child of our firstinterview. The teacher has far less ability than Clarence Robins to elicitspeech from this child; Clarence knows the community, the things that Leon hasbeen doing, and the things that Leon would like to talk about. But the powerrelationships in a one-to-one confrontation between adult and child are tooasymmetrical. This does not mean that some black children will not talk a greatdeal when alone with an adult, or that an adult cannot get close to any child.It means that the social situation is the most powerful determinant of verbalbehavior and that an adult must enter into the right social relation with achild if he wants to find out what a child can do. This is just what manyteachers cannot do.<p><p><p>The view of the black speech community which we obtain from our work in theghetto areas is precisely the opposite from that reported by Deutsch,Engelmann. and Bereiter. We see a child bathed in verbal stimulation frommorning to night. We see many speech events which depend upon the competitiveexhibitions of verbal skills: singing, sounding, toasts, rifting, Iouding--awhole range of activities in which the individual gains status through his useof language. We see the younger child trying to acquire these skills from olderchildren--hanging around on the outskirts of the older peer groups, andimitating this behavior. We see, however, no connection between verbal skill atthe speech events characteristic of the street culture and success in theschoolroom; which says something about classrooms rather than about a child'slanguage.<p><p><p>There are undoubtedly many verbal skills which children from ghetto areas mustlearn in order to do well in school, and some of these are indeedcharacteristic of middle-class verbal behavior. Precision in spelling, practicein handling abstract symbols, the ability to state explicitly the meaning ofwords, and a richer knowledge of the Latinate vocabulary may all be usefulacquisitions. But is it true that all of the middle-class verbal habits arefunctional and desirable in school? Before we impose middle-class verbal styleupon children from other cultural groups, we should find out how much of it isuseful for the main work of analyzing and generalizing, and how much is merelystylistic--or even dysfunctional. In high school and college, middle-classchildren spontaneously complicate their syntax to the point that instructorsdespair of getting them to make their language simpler and clearer.<p><p><p><p><p><p>Our work in the speech community makes it painfully obvious that in many waysworking-class speakers are more effective narrators, reasoners, and debatersthan many middle-class speakers, who temporize, qualify, and lose theirargument in a mass of irrelevant detail. Many academic writers try to ridthemselves of the part of middle-class style that is empty pretension, and keepthe part necessary for precision. But the average middle-class speaker that weencounter makes no such effort; he is enmeshed in verbiage, the victim ofsociolinguistic factors beyond his control.<p><p><p><p><p><p>I will not attempt to support this argument here with systematic quantitativeevidence, although it is possible to develop measures which show how farmiddle-class speakers can wander from the point. I would like to contrast twospeakers dealing with roughly the same topic: matters of belief. The first isLarry H., a fifteen-year-old core member of another group, the Jets. Larry isbeing interviewed here by John Lewis, our participant-observer amongadolescents in South Central Harlem.<p><p><p><p>JL: What happens to you after you die? Do you know?<p><p><p><p>LARRY H: Yeah, I know. (What?) After they put you in the ground, your bodyturns into--ah--bones, an' shit.<p><p><p><p>JL: What happens to your spirit?<p><p><p><p>LARRY: Your spirit--soon as you die, your spirit leaves you. (And where doesthe spirit go?) Well, it all depends. (On what?) You know, like some people sayif you re good an' shit, your spirit goin' t'heaven...'n' if you bad, yourspirit goin' to hell. Well, bullshit! Your spirit goin' to hell anyway, good orbad.<p><p><p><p>JL: Why?<p><p><p><p>LARRY: Why? I'll tell you why. Cause. you see, doesn' nobody really know thatit's a God, y'know. 'cause, I mean I have seen black gods, pink gods, whitegods, all color gods. and don t nobody know it's really a God. An' when they besayin' if you good, you goin' t'heaven, thas bullshit. 'cause you ain't goin'to no heaven, 'cause it ain't no heaven for you to go to.<p><p><p><p>Larry is a gifted speaker of the Black English vernacular (BEV) as opposed tostandard English (SE). His grammar shows a high concentration of suchcharacteristic BEV forms as negative inversion [don't nobody know], negativeconcord you ain't goin' to no heaven], invariant be [when they be sayin ],dummy it for SE there [it ain't no heaven], optional copula deletion [if you'regood...if you bad], and full forms of auxiliaries [I have seen]. The only SEinfluence in this passage is the one case of doesn't instead of the invariantdon't of BEV. Larry also provides a paradigmatic example of the rhetoricalstyle of BEV: he can sum up a complex argument in a few words, and the fullforce of his opinions comes through without qualification or reservation. He iseminently quotable, and his interviews give us a great many concise statementsof the BEV point of view. One can almost say that Larry speaks the BEVculture.<p><p><p>It is the logical form of this passage which is of particular interest here.Larry presents a complex set of interdependent propositions which can beexplicated by setting out the SE equivalents in linear order. The basicargument is to deny the twin propositions:<p><p><p><p>     (A) If you are good,          (B) then your spirit<p><p>                                                         will go to heaven.<p><p><p><p>     (not A) If you are bad.     (C) then your spirit will go<p><p>                                                       to hell.<p><p><p><p>Larry denies (B), and allows that if (A) or (not A) is true, (C) will follow.His argument may be outlined:<p><p><p><p>(1) Everyone has a different idea of what God is like.<p><p>(2) Therefore nobody really knows that God exists.<p><p>(3) If there is a heaven. it was made by God.<p><p>(4) If God doesn't exist, he couldn t have made heaven.<p><p>(5) Therefore heaven does not exist.<p><p>(6) You can't go somewhere that doesn't exist.<p><p> (not B) Therefore you can't go to heaven. <p><p>(C) Therefore you are going to hell.<p><p><p><p>This hypothetical argument is not carried on at a high level of seriousness. Itis a game played with ideas as counters, in which opponents use a wide varietyof verbal devices to win. There is no personal commitment to any of thesepropositions, and no reluctance to strengthen one's argument by bending therules of logic as in the (2, 4) sequence. But if the opponent invokes the rulesof logic, they hold. In John Lewis' interviews, he often makes this move, andthe force of his argument is always acknowledged and countered within the rulesof logic.<p><p><p><p>JL: Well, if there's no heaven, how could there be a hell?<p><p><p><p>LARRY: I mean--ye-eah. Well, let me tell you, it ain't no hell, 'cause this ishell right here, y'know! (This is hell?) Yeah, this is hell right here!<p><p><p><p>Larry's answer is quick, ingenious, and decisive. The application of the(3-4-5) argument to hell is denied, since hell is here, and thereforeconclusion (not B) stands. These are not ready-made or preconceived opinions,but new propositions devised to win the logical argument in the game beingplayed. The reader will note the speed and precision of Larry's mentaloperations. He does not wander, or insert meaningless verbiage. It is oftensaid that the nonstandard vernacular is not suited for. dealing with abstractor hypothetical questions, but in fact, speakers of the BE vernacular takegreat delight in exercising their wit and logic on the most improbable andproblematical matters. Despite the fact that Larry H. does not believe in God,and has just denied all knowledge of him, John Lewis advances the followinghypothetical question:<p><p><p><p>JL: But, just say that there is a God, what color is he? White or black?<p><p><p><p>LARRY: Well, if it is a God...I wouldn' know what color, I couldn' say--couldn'nobody say what--<p><p><p><p>JL: But now, jus' suppose there was a God--<p><p><p><p>LARRY: Unless'n they say...<p><p><p><p>JL: No, I was jus' sayin' jus' suppose there is a God, would he be white orblack?<p><p><p><p>LARRY: He'd be white, man.<p><p><p><p>JL: Why?<p><p><p><p>LARRY: Why? I'll tell you why. 'Cause the average whitey out here goteverything, you dig? And the nigger ain't got shit, y'know? Y'unnerstan'?So--um--for--in order for that to happen, you know it ain't no black God that'sdoin' that bullshit.<p><p><p>No one can hear Larry's answer to this question without being convinced ofbeing in the presence of a skilled speaker with great "verbal presence ofmind," who can use the English language expertly for many purposes.<p><p><p>Let us now turn to the second speaker, an upper middle-class, college-educatedblack man being interviewed by Clarence Robins in our survey of adults in SouthCentral Harlem.<p><p><p>CR: Do you know of anything that someone can do, to have someone who has passedon visit him in a dream?<p><p><p>CHAS M.: Well, I even heard my parents say that there is such a thing assomething in dreams, some things like that, and sometimes dreams do come true.I have personally never had a dream come true. I've never dreamt that somebodywas dying and they actually died (Mhm), or that I was going to have ten dollarsthe next day and somehow I got ten dollars in my pocket. (Mhm.) I don'tparticularly believe in that, I don't think it's true. I do feel, though, thatthere is such a thing as--ah--witchcraft. I do feel that in certain culturesthere is such a thing as witchcraft, or some sort of science of witchcraft; Idon't think that it's just a matter of believing hard enough that there is sucha thing as witchcraft. I do believe that there is such a thing that a personcan put himself in a state of mind (Mhm), or that--er--something could be giventhem to intoxicate them in a certain--to a certain frame of mind--that--thatcould actually be considered witchcraft.<p><p><p>Charles M. is obviously a "good speaker" who strikes the listener aswell-educated, intelligent and sincere. He is a likable and attractiveperson--the kind of person that middle-class listeners rate very high on ascale of "job suitability" and equally high as a potential friend. His languageis more moderate and tempered than Larry's: he makes every effort to qualm hisopinions, and seems anxious to avoid any misstatements or overstatements. Fromthese qualities emerges the primary characteristic of this passage--itsverbosity. Words multiply, some modifying and qualifying, others repeating orpadding the main argument. The first half of this extract is a response to theinitial question on dreams, basically:<p><p><p>(1) Some people say that dreams sometimes come true.<p><p><p>(2) I have never had a dream come true.<p><p><p>(3) Therefore I don't believe (1).<p><p><p>This much of Charles M.'s response is well directed to the point of thequestion. He then volunteers a statement of his beliefs about witchcraft whichshows the difficulty of middle-class speakers who (a) want to express a beliefin something but (b) want to show themselves as judicious, rational, and freefrom superstitions. The basic proposition can be stated simply in five words:<p><p><p>But I believe in witchcraft.<p><p><p>However, the idea is enlarged to exactly one hundred words, and it is difficultto see what else is being said. The vacuity of this passage becomes moreevident if we remove repetitions, fashionable words, and stylisticdecorations:<p><p><p>But I believe in witchcraft.<p><p><p>I don't think witchcraft is just a belief.<p><p><p>A person can put himself or be put in a state of mind that is witchcraft.<p><p><p>Without the extra verbiage and the OK words like science, culture andintoxicate, Charles M. appears as something less than a first-rate thinker. Theinitial impression of him as a good speaker is simply our long-conditionedreaction to middle-class verbosity: we know that people who use these stylisticdevices are educated people, and we are inclined to credit them with sayingsomething intelligent.<p><p><p>Let us now examine Bereiter's own data on the verbal behavior of the blackchildren he dealt with. The expressions They mine and Me got juice are cited asexamples of a language which lacks the means for expressing logicalrelations--in this case characterized as "a series of badly connected words."In the case of They mine, it is apparent that Bereiter confuses the notions oflogic and explicitness. We know that there are many languages of the worldwhich do not have a present copula, and which conjoin subject and predicatecomplement without a verb. Russian, Hungarian, and Arabic may be foreign, butthey are not by the same token illogical. In the case of black English we arenot dealing with even this superficial grammatical difference, but rather witha low-level rule which carries contraction one step further to delete singleconsonants representing the verbs is, have, or will. We have yet to find anychildren who do not sometimes use the full forms of is or will, even thoughthey may frequently delete it.<p><p><p>The deletion of the is or are in black English is not the result of erratic orillogical behavior: it follows the same regular rules as standard Englishcontraction. Wherever standard English can contract, black children use eitherthe contracted form or (more commonly) the deleted zero form. Thus They minecorresponds to standard English They're mine, not to the full form They aremine. On the other hand, no such deletion is possible in positions wherestandard English cannot contract: just as one cannot say That's what they're instandard English, That's what they is equally impossible in the vernacular weare considering. The appropriate use of the deletion rule, like the contractionrule, requires a deep and intimate knowledge of English grammar and phonology.Such knowledge is not available for conscious inspection by native speakers:the rules we have worked out for standard contraction have never appeared inany grammar, and are certainly not a part of the conscious knowledge of anystandard English speakers. Nevertheless, the adult or child who uses theserules must have formed at some level of psychological organization clearconcepts of "tense marker," "verb phrase," "rule ordering," "sentenceembedding," "pronoun," and many other grammatical categories which areessential parts of any logical system.<p><p><p>Bereiter's reaction to the sentence Me got juice is even more puzzling. IfBereiter believes that Me got juice is not a logical expression, it can only bethat he interprets the use of the objective pronoun me as representing adifference in logical relationship to the verb; that the child is in factsaying that "the juice got him" rather than "he got the juice"! If on the otherhand the child means "I got juice," then this sentence form shows only that hehas not learned the formal rules for the use of the subjective form I andoblique form me.<p><p><p>Bereiter shows even more profound ignorance of the rules of discourse and ofsyntax when he rejects "In the tree" as an illogical or badly formed answer to"Where is the squirrel?" Such elliptical answers are of course used byeveryone, and they show the appropriate deletion of subject and main verb,leaving the locative which is questioned by wh + there. The reply In the treedemonstrates that the listener has been attentive to and apprehended the syntaxof the speaker. Whatever formal structure we wish to write for expressions suchas Yes or Home or In the tree, it is obvious that they cannot be interpretedwithout knowing the structure of the question which preceded them, and thatthey presuppose an understanding of the syntax of the question. Thus if you askme, "Where is the squirrel?" it is necessary for me to understand the sentencefrom an underlying form which would otherwise have produced The squirrel isthere. If the child had answered The tree, or Squirrel the tree, or The intree, we would then assume that he did not understand the syntax of the fullform, The squirrel is in the tree. Given the data that Bereiter presents, wecannot conclude that the child has no grammar, but only that the investigatordoes not understand the rules of grammar. It does not necessarily do any harmto use the full form The squirrel is in the tree, if one wants to make fullyexplicit the rules of grammar which the child has internalized. Much of logicalanalysis consists of making explicit just that kind of internalized rule. Butit is hard to believe that any good can come from a program which begins withso many misconceptions about the input data. Bereiter and Engelmann believethat in teaching the child to say The squirrel is in the tree or This is a boxand This is not a box, they are teaching him an entirely new language, whereasin fact they are only teaching him to produce slightly different forms of thelanguage he already has.<p><p><p>If there is a failure of logic involved here, it is surely in the approach ofthe verbal-deprivation theorists, rather than in the mental abilities of thechildren concerned. We can isolate six distinct steps in the reasoning whichhas led to programs such as those of Deutsch, Bereiter, and Engelmann:<p><p>     1. The lower-class child's verbal response to a formal and threateningsituation is used to demonstrate his lack of verbal capacity, or verbaldeficit.<p><p>     2. This verbal deficit is declared to be a major cause of the lower-classchild's poor performance in school.<p><p><p>     3. Since middle-class children do better in school, middle-class speechhabits are said to be necessary for learning.<p><p><p>     4. Class and ethnic differences in grammatical form are equated withdifferences in the capacity for logical analysis.<p><p><p>     5. Teaching the child to mimic certain formal speech patterns used bymiddle-class teachers is seen as teaching him to think logically.<p><p><p>     6. Children who learn these formal speech patterns are then said to bethinking logically, and it is predicated that they will do much better inreading and arithmetic in the years to follow.<p><p><p>This article has proved that numbers 1. and 2. at least are wrong. However, itis not too naive to ask, What is wrong with being wrong? We have alreadyconceded that black children need help in analyzing language into its surfacecomponents, and in being more explicit. But there are, in fact, serious anddamaging consequences of the verbal-deprivation theory. These may be consideredunder two headings: (a) the theoretical bias and (b) the consequences offailure.<p><p><p>It is widely recognized that the teacher's attitude toward the child is animportant factor in the latter's success or failure. The work of RobertRosenthal on "self-fulfilling prophecies" shows that the progress of childrenin the early grades can be dramatically affected by a single random labeling ofcertain children as "intellectual bloomers." When the everyday language ofblack children is stigmatized as "not a language at all" and "not possessingthe means for logical thought," the effect of such a labeling is repeated manytimes during each day of the school year. Every time that a child uses a formof BEV without the copula or with negative concord, he will be labeling himselffor the teacher's benefit as "illogical," as a "nonconceptual thinker." Thisnotion gives teachers a ready-made, theoretical basis for the prejudice theymay already feel against the lower-class black child and his language. Whenthey hear him say I don't want none or They mine, they will be hearing, throughthe bias provided by the verbal-deprivation theory, not an English dialectdifferent from theirs, but the primitive mentality of the savage mind.<p><p><p>But what if the teacher succeeds in training the child to use the new languageconsistently? The verbal deprivation theory holds that this will lead to awhole chain of successes in school, and that the child will be drawn away fromthe vernacular culture into the middle-class world. Undoubtedly this willhappen with a few isolated individuals, just as it happens in every schoolsystem today for a few children. But we are concerned not with the few but themany, and for the majority of black children the distance between them and theschool is bound to widen under this approach.<p><p><p>The essential fallacy of the verbal-deprivation theory lies in tracing theeducational failure of the child to his personal deficiencies. At present,these deficiencies are said to be caused by his home environment. It istraditional to explain a child's failure in school by his inadequacy; but whenfailure reaches such massive proportions, it seems necessary to look at thesocial and cultural obstacles to learning and the inability of the school toadjust to the social situation.<p><p><p>The second area in which the verbal-deprivation theory is doing serious harm toour educational system is in the consequences of this failure and the reactionto it. As Operation Head Start fails, the interpretations which we receive willbe from the same educational psychologists who designed this program. The faultwill be found, not in the data, the theory. or the methods used, but rather inthe children who have failed to respond to the opportunities offered them. Whenblack children fail to show the significant advance which the deprivationtheory predicts, it will be further proof of the profound gulf which separatestheir mental processes from those of civilized, middle-class mankind.<p><p><p>A sense of the failure of Operation Head Start is already commonplace. Someprominent figures In the program have reacted to this situation by saying thatintervention did not take place early enough. Bettye M. Caldwell notes that<p><p><p>"the research literature of the last decade dealing with social-classdifferences has made abundantly clear that all parents are not qualified toprovide even the basic essentials of physical and psychological care to theirchildren."<p><p><p> The deficit theory now begins to focus on the "longstanding patterns ofparental deficit" which fill the literature. "There is, perhaps unfortunately,"writes Caldwell, "no literacy test for motherhood." Failing such eugenicmeasures, she has proposed "educationally oriented day care for culturallydeprived children between six months and three years of age." The children arereturned home each evening to "maintain primary emotional relationships withtheir own families," but during the day they are removed "hopefully to preventthe deceleration in rate of development which seems to occur in many deprivedchildren around the age of two to three years."<p><p><p>There are others who feel that even the best of the intervention programs, suchas those of Bereiter and Engelmann, will not help the black child no matterwhen they are applied--that we are faced once again with the "inevitablehypothesis" of the genetic inferiority of the black people. Arthur Jensen, forexample, in his Harvard Educational Review paper (1969), argues that theverbal-deprivation theorists with whom he has been associated--Deutsch,Whiteman, Katz, Bereiter--have been given every opportunity to prove their caseand have failed. This opinion forms part of the argument leading to his overallconclusion that the "preponderance of the evidence is...less consistent with astrictly environmental hypothesis than with the genetic hypothesis."<p><p><p>Jensen argues that the middle-class white population is differentiated from theworking-class white and black population in the ability for "cognitive orconceptual learning," which Jensen calls Level II intelligence as against mere"associative learning," or Level I intelligence.<p><p><p>Thus Jensen found that one group of middle-class children were helped by theirconcept-forming ability to recall twenty familiar objects that could beclassified into four categories: animals, furniture, clothing, or foods.Lower-class black children did just as well as middle-class children with amiscellaneous set, but showed no improvement with objects that could be soorganized.<p><p><p>In the earliest stages of language learning, children acquire "selectionalrestrictions" in their use of words. For example, they learn that some verbstake ANIMATE subjects, but others only INANIMATE ones: thus we say The machinebreaks but not John breaks; The paper tears but not George tears. A speaker ofEnglish must master such subtle categories as the things which break, likeboards, glasses, and ropes; things which tear, like shirts, paper, and skin;things which snap, like buttons, potato chips, and plastic, and othercategories which smash, crumple, or go bust.<p><p><p>In studies of Samoan children, Keith Kernan has shown that similar rules arelearned reliably long before the grammatical particles that mark tense, number,and so on. The experimentation on free recall that Jensen reports ignores suchabilities, and defines intelligence as a particular way of answering aparticular kind of question within a narrow cultural framework. Recent work ofanthropologists in other cultures is beginning to make some headway indiscovering how our tests bias the results so as to make normally intelligentpeople look stupid. Michael Cole and his associates gave the same kind of freerecall tests to Kpelle speakers in Liberia. Those who had not been toschool--children or adults--could only remember eight or ten out of the twentyand showed no "clustering" according to categories, no matter how long thetrials went on. Yet one simple change in the test method produced a surprisingchange. The interviewer took each of the objects to be remembered and held itover a chair: one chair for each category, or just one chair for allcategories. Suddenly the Kpelle subjects showed a dramatic improvement,remembered seventeen to eighteen objects, and matched American subjects in bothrecall and the amount of clustering by categories. We do not understand thiseffect, for we are only beginning to discover the subtle biases built in ourtest methods which prevent people from using the abilities that they display intheir language and in everyday life.<p><p><p>Linguists are in an excellent position to demonstrate the fallacies of theverbal-deprivation theory. All linguists agree that nonstandard dialects arehighly structured systems; they do not see these dialects as accumulations oferrors caused by the failure of their speakers to master standard English. Whenlinguists hear black children saying He crazy or Her my friend they do not heara "primitive language." Nor do they believe that the speech of working-classpeople is merely a form of emotional expression, incapable of relating logicalthought. Linguists therefore condemn with a single voice Bereiter's view thatthe vernacular can be disregarded.<p><p><p>There is no reason to believe that any nonstandard vernacular is in itself anobstacle to learning. The chief problem is ignorance of language on the part ofall concerned. Our job as linguists is to remedy this ignorance: Bereiter andEngelmann want to reinforce it and justify it. Teachers are now being told toignore the language of black children as unworthy of attention and useless forlearning. They are being taught to hear every natural utterance of the child asevidence of his mental inferiority. As linguists we are unanimous in condemningthis view as bad observation, bad theory, and bad practice.<p><p><p>That educational psychology should be strongly influenced by a theory so falseto the facts of language is unfortunate; but that children should be thevictims of this ignorance is intolerable. If linguists can contribute some oftheir valuable knowledge and energy toward exposing the fallacies of theverbal-deprivation theory, we will have done a great deal to justify thesupport that society has given to basic research in our field. </blockquote><p><p><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1972 by William Labov.

But if,on the other hand, we now delay and hesitate in our plans for 1944 or 1945, thestruggle might even then be inconclusive. There is no need to portray thegravity of such a situation. Every year that victory eludes us multipliesmanifold the dangers to our civilization. Beyond some date, if war continues,lies defeat for this century's hopes for human freedom.<p><p><p>I am deeply concerned with the part that American youth will play in the war inthe next fear rears. There is a fairly sharp dividing line that separatesuntrained and inexperienced youth from those whose skills or experience are ofdirect value to the nation. Now it is relatively easy to determine whether aperson who has a Job is doing more for the country by staying on that job or byjoining the armed forces. Indeed, even if the man in question happens to haveno job at the moment, but does have a certain skill based on education orexperience, it is relatively easy to determine where his place should be.<p><p><p>But with boys who are in school or college such criteria do not apply. One isdealing here with potential power, not developed capacity. If Selective Servicewere to be expanded to include those of eighteen or nineteen years of age, asmay well be necessary, a different set of standards must be developed to definea necessary man. Indeed, with the lowering of the draft age to twenty, thedifficulty of assessing latent talent already becomes evident. From now on boththe draft boards and the Army will increasingly face the complex problem of howto find the best use for promising but untrained material.<p><p><p>In time of war the demands of the Army and the Navy for able-bodied young menof fighting age overshadow all other considerations. Therefore, until the Warand Navy Departments could complete their plans, the situation was by necessitydifficult and perplexing. The last five months have been trying times for youngmen in our colleges and universities, the confusion has been great. On the onehand came statements from some high quarters that all students would servetheir country best by remaining at their studies. On the other hand, variousbranches of the armed services actively recruited men from eighteen years ofage; furthermore, the prospect of induction through Selective Service at twentyloomed ahead. Every young man naturally wishes to have his services utilized bythe country as effectively as possible. College students have no desire to beplaced in the position of letting some other group do the fighting for them. Noone wishes to use his talents to avoid the risks of war.<p><p><p>The question of draft deferments added a complicating factor. Shortly after theSelective Service Act came into operation the colleges and universities wereasked to cooperate by requesting deferment of certain types of students--forinstance, students in aeronautics and mechanical engineering. In the days whenwe were building up a relatively small army from a large pool of potentialsoldiers and our chief contribution to the war was an ever expanding arsenal,such a policy was clearly wise. Since Pearl Harbor, however, the situation hascompletely altered. In the first place, the country now recognizes that theneeds of the armed forces for young men override all other considerations. Inthe second place, the question of serving the country on the home front or in acombat unit is no longer an impersonal abstract problem. For many individualsthe decision will be literally one of life or death. The hazards of war are byno means equally distributed; there is no use pretending that all forms ofnational service today are equally dangerous or grueling, for they are not.<p><p><p>This fact which we cannot blink makes it imperative, I believe, that as far aspossible the decision as to where a man will serve should be made by thegovernment itself. Now that the Army and the Navy have come to the collegeswith definite plans and the Manpower Commission has been appointed, the matterof deferment should be a governmental responsibility. Such is already the casein the field of medical education. It is no longer necessary for a universityto ask for the deferment of medical students, since all who are physically fitcan be enrolled in the Medical Reserve Corps of the Army or the Navy. But thisprinciple might well be extended to other specialized branches of the services.It applies just as truly to the demands of industry for college men. Here againthe Federal Government must soon decide. If the Manpower Commission surveys theproblem and concludes that some able-bodied young men must be trained fornonmilitary posts, then the Commission should pick the men and order them intothis branch of national service. In time of war no college or individual shouldbe asked to shoulder the heavy responsibility of determining who should facedanger and who should not.<p><p><p><p><p><br><p><br><center> <b> <font size=4>2</font></center> </b><p><p><p><p>Those who are clearly debarred by physical handicap from the combat servicescan nevertheless prepare themselves to play an important role in the nationaleffort. They are the young men who must help staff our industries and ourgovernmental agencies. As young executive assistants, as laboratory workers, ascivil servants, as engineers, they must labor at desks or in factories as partof the vast army of production. The education of these men should be directedwith such tasks in mind. Probably every college student has now been able toestimate, with a physician's aid, what his chances are of passing the physicalexamination for the Army or the Navy. On that estimate hinge his plans for theimmediate future. But even those who cannot join the armed services willprobably wish to accelerate their course of study. For by so doing they will atthe earliest moment become participating members in the gigantic nationalundertaking. The selection and training of young men takes on an urgency thatmay revolutionize our colleges and universities.<p><p><p>For those who are able-bodied, the situation has by now been clarified. TheNavy through its V-1 program, and the Army, through its Aviation Cadet programand its Enlisted Reserve Corps, offer opportunities to college students to "join up." No one can longer complain that orders from Washington are lacking.In each of these programs for training officers a portion, at least, of collegeeducation is assured to each individual who enrolls. And while neither the Navynor the Army promises a commission, the avowed object is to develop leadershipthrough college education. I understand that approximately 160,000 men of eachcollege year can be enrolled under these three programs. I assume some methodwill be devised by which this overall program can be joined to the scheme bywhich medical students are now enrolled, and that due regard will be paid tothe training of the scientific specialists who are needed in modern war.<p><p><p>It should be a matter of record that this scheme was not formulated by thecolleges. And whether it is successful or not must be measured, not by itseffect on the colleges (which in terms of enrollment will be good), but on itseffectiveness in utilizing the young talent of the nation.<p><p><p>On this latter point some of us have serious reservations. To my mind, there isone inherent weakness which is in no sense a fault of the Navy or the Army.Indeed, it was beyond their power alone to obviate this defect, for it residesin our system of education. I refer to the fact that equality of educationalopportunity is still far from an accomplished fact. This is true in spite ofour magnificent state- and city-supported colleges and universities, and inspite of our scholarships in privately controlled institutions. Compared withany other country, the United States is miles ahead, of course. Never before inhistory has it been possible for so many of each generation to obtain aneducation commensurate with their talents and without regard to economicstatus. And this is so because of the miraculous development of the publicschools during the last fifty years.<p><p><p>Nevertheless, anyone who is familiar with the operation of our Americaneducational system realizes that all too often accidents of geography and ofparental fortune determine who goes to college and who does not. Every surveyof our educational system has emphasized this fact. No one can deny that thereare large numbers of potential officers in each age group who do not now entercollege. Many of these, because of financial pressure, are leaving high schooland taking employment in war industries. It can be argued that for the momentthey are of as much value in industry as they would be in the Army. But if theypossess the native ability to be officers, they will be ill-prepared for acommission when they are later inducted into the Army through SelectiveService.<p><p><p><p><p><br><p><br><center> <b> <font size=4>3</font></center> </b><p><p><p><p><p>Consider these figures. There are approximately 1,200,000 in each agegroup--that is, there are 1,200,000 young men who, each year, might entercolleges and universities. The actual number enrolled is somewhat less than 20per cent-- somewhat less than 250,000. (This figure includes those who entertwo-year junior colleges, which I understand are included in the Army and theNavy scheme.) Now I have no doubt that the armed forces will select from the200,000 the most promising material. I do not doubt that the further"screening" or sifting by examination at the end of two years of work will beeffective. But clearly, a million of the contemporaries of those chosen willnot be considered in this colleague competition; they cannot stand ascandidates because they are not enrolled in a four-year college or universityor a junior college. Can anyone doubt that of this large pool of a millionyoung men there are at least another 160,000 of ability and native worth equalto that of the students selected from the college population?<p><p><p>To be sure, when these boys are inducted they will have the same opportunity tobe chosen for officer training camps as those who have had college training.The Army has wisely, I believe, required that even the members of the EnlistedReserve Corps must compete with all the other privates during the firstthirteen weeks of training. But if two years or more in college is of value toan officer, as the present scheme implies, then the non-college man startsvanish a big handicap against him. Native talent developed by education is whatthe Army requires for leaders. It would seem in the best interest of the nationto select this talent from as wide a group as possible, at least from theentire number who are graduated each year from school.<p><p><p>Personally, I wish that it had been possible for the government to have chosenthe 160,000 men purely on the basis of merit, without regard for their economicsituation, and to have financed these group for whatever further education wasrequired by the Army or the Navy. Such a scheme would have more nearly opened amilitary career to the talented, irrespective of the accidents of birth.<p><p><p>A college education must be founded on the work of the secondary schools.Therefore, on any basis, those who dropped out of school would be ineligiblefor further academic training. And, as I have already pointed out, there is aheavy shrinkage during the high-school years. Nearly 40 per cent of those whoenter high school leave before graduation; nevertheless some 600,000 boys aregraduated each year and are thus ready to proceed to college. It is from thisgroup--the graduates of our secondary schools--that I should like to have hadthe choice made; not from the 250,000 who, to some extent for accidentalreasons, proceed to college. Furthermore, I believe such a plan would largelydiminish the loss of promising boys from the upper high-school classes. Thevery fact that there might be an opportunity on graduation to be chosen for aselected corps destined for further education would have the effect of keepingthe right boys in school.<p><p><p>I realize that such a scheme presents formidable administrative difficulties.But I believe they could be overcome almost as readily as those inherent inSelective Service. The pattern of a decentralized administration throughwell-chosen state boards has already been supplied. Special boards appointedfor the purpose could rely on the appraisals of high-school principals inmaking a fair selection of local nominees. From the candidates thus presentedon a quota basis by each locality, it seems probable that the Army and the Navycould choose as readily as from the lists of freshmen in our colleges.<p><p><p>Of course, the establishment of such a training corps financed by thegovernment would require Congressional action, and large sums of money would beinvolved. No one therefore, can justly criticize the Army and the Navy for notstarting down this road. It would not be difficult, however, at some later timeto modify the present plans in the direction just outlined. In the meantime awidespread system of military scholarships, carefully allotted to various areasand impartially administered, would widen the basis for selection. Many who arefamiliar with the educational problems of boys from sixteen to twenty years ofage believe that it would be possible to grant financial aid wisely even tothose in school. This would be particularly true in time of war, for theobjectives of further education can be defined in terms of the Army and theNavy. Qualities of leadership, of general intelligence, of moral stamina, areprimarily required. These, together with special aptitudes for aviation on theone hand or the physical sciences on the other, would indicate the desiredman.<p><p><p><p><p><br><p><br><center> <b> <font size=4>4</font></center> </b><p><p><p><p><p>In short, I believe two steps should be taken to utilize more effectively thelatent talent of our younger men. Both cost money but I believe that, solely interms of the winning of the war, both steps should be worth all the millionsthat would be required. The first step is to keep the most promising youths inhigh school; the second, to send them on to college. Federal funds would berequired, but this does not mean Federal control of education. For the moneycould be best spent through local agencies and by those closely in touch withthe public school system and our colleges. This is not the place to outline thedetails of such proposals. It is for Congress to formulate the requiredlegislation and provide the funds. If the country demands such a revision ofour educational pattern as a war measure, it will before long take place. To mymind it is clear that we must plan now for the officers who are to be drawn inlater years from the age groups which have not yet been called. To that end,ability must be discovered and financed by the government so that the very bestmen will be available for the nation's needs.<p><p><p>In conclusion, may I point out that the method of selecting officers for theArmy and the Navy has significance for the postwar period as well as for thewar. To the extent that a college education is a road to promotion, and to theextent that a college education is a privileged position based on familyfinances, we are hardening the social strata as we expand our Army and ourNavy. Conversely, to the extent that we freely open the road to thecommissioned ranks by eliminating the economic barriers to further education,we are increasing the fluidity of our social system. To my mind, the Americaninterpretation of democracy, the very cause for which we fight, rests on theflexibility of our national life--it rests on our denial of the doctrine ofhereditary privilege. For one hundred and fifty years we have repudiated theidea of a ruling caste; we have affirmed our adherence to the ideal of aclassless nation. Such phrases as "There are no classes in America," and "Three generations from shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves," have been the hallmarksof America's social order.<p><p><p>Repeatedly in our history the unique features of our society have beenunderlined. It was thus that General Garfield, seventy years ago, answeredMacaulay's famous letter predicting the downfall of this republic as a resultof universal suffrage. This letter, which has been brought to public attentionagain in recent years, prophesied that the time would come when the governmentwould not be able to restrain a distressed and discontented majority; thatdistress and spoilation would follow each other in a vicious circle and "either civilization or liberty must perish."  "Your Constitution," saidMacaulay, "is all sail and no anchor." To such gloomy forebodings Garfieldreplied as follows: "I venture the declaration that this opinion of Macaulay'sis vulnerable. . . . It is based on the belief that mankind are born intopermanent classes and that in the main they must live, work and die in thefixed class or conditions in which they are born." There such permanent classesexist, the conflict of which Macaulay speaks is inevitable, declared GeneralGarfield. But, he continued, " in this country there are no classes in theBritish sense of that word,-- no impassable barriers of caste. Now that slaveryis abolished we can truly say that through our political society there run nofixed horizontal strata above which none can pass. Our society resembles ratherthe waves of the ocean whose every drop may move freely among its fellows, andmay rise toward the light until it flashes on the crest of the highest wave."<p><p>Thus runs a characteristically American declaration of the last century. Neverhas the doctrine been better stated. And it was expressed at a moment whenman's hopes ran high. An expanding economy, free lands, the spirit of thefrontier, made this unique American ideal almost a reality in the nineteenthcentury. The last fifty ,years, however, have seen a reversal of the process.The frontier vanished, and the urbanization and industrialization of ournational life began. Large aggregations of men were brought together to laborin expanding factories-- the words "proletariat" and "class struggle" enteredthe American vocabulary. All the trends except one were toward a greaterstratification of our society toward the renunciation of a cardinal principleof our early democratic faith. The one exception was the growth of our systemof public education. Through that channel alone Sue gave new meaning to theword "equality." For through free education a man's children might hope to showtheir worth.<p><p><p>I firmly believe that we must develop still further this new instrument forgedby a free people. There are other methods which can be and should be devisedfor increasing the social mobility of our system, for increasing the base bywhich the members of each new generation rise or fall according to their ownefforts. But I am convinced that very largely through strengthening our systemof public education we may build those bulwarks which will ensure theperpetuation of American democracy in the post-war world. I am Convinced thatthrough making real our doctrine of educational opportunity we may recapture anessential element in our democracy: the birthright of opportunity which in anearlier age was the gift of the American frontier.<p><p><p>If I am right as to the importance of strengthening this unique feature of oursocial system, then the question of choosing officers in this war is of momentfor two separate reasons. First, we need all the talent we can find for themilitary task at hand --we cannot afford to leave any portion of it untrained;second, we need to demonstrate that this republic is anxious to approach morenearly to the ideal of a nation without caste. If the two objects were incontradiction, clearly that which concerned America of the future must yield tothe demands of war. For we are agreed, today, that the requirements for victorytake precedence over all reforms. But, as a matter of fact, the two goals areclose together. If we have a well-supported educational system by which talentreaches the college level irrespective of private income, we shall bothincrease the effectiveness of our leadership in battle and demonstrate thereality of our American ideal. We shall forward the winning of the war and atthe same time we shall lessen those tensions between economic groupings whichin the modern world are ever in danger of threatening a democracy's internalpeace.<p><p><p><p>A widespread system of public and private education, a miracle judged by anyother country or any other age, stands ready for our use. It is for theAmerican people to say how this great social engine shall be employed in atotal war. On the answer depends in no small measure the effectiveness of ouryoung officers who will fight on the land, on the sea, and in the air; on theanswer turns also, perhaps, the course of much of the social history of theUnited States in the uncertain decades yet to come.<p><br><p><br><p><p><p><i>JAMES BRYANT CONANT became President of Harvard in 1933.

To acomparative educationalists many questions about the selection and training ofdoctors and lawyers in different countries are questions almost withoutmeaning. Asking whether European schools are better than schools in the UnitedStates is like asking a comparative anatomist whether a whale is a bettermammal than an elephant.<p><p><p>The comparative anatomist is interested in examining the similarities anddifferences to be found in animal or plant organs which carry out the samefunction; he is very cautious, however, about proclaiming the virtues of adevice found in one particular species over a device for a similar purposefound in another. Of course, the anatomist knows that mammals are modified onlyslowly by changes in environment; unlike schools or colleges, no man-madedecisions will radically alter the structure of the functioning organism he isexamining.<p><p><p>Some will argue that this vitiates my analogy; they may claim that the essenceof human organizations lies in the fact that conscious acts of men and womencan change them, and as history shows, overnight if need be. "But wait amoment, ' the student of the comparative anatomy of schools will say, '-notovernight surely, except at the point of a bayonet or in our time under theshadow of armored vehicles and tanks." And such changes, he will argue, are theequivalent of pathological alterations.<p><p><p>History shows that, except under conditions of duress brought about by externalforces, schools and colleges have developed gradually in different parts of theworld in response to a variety of different conditions. They are a product ofthe society they serve and they also influence the future of this society.Reformers who have sought to change education have had to be content with minoralterations or else have had to devote a lifetime to their task.<p><p><p>It is clear that various educational devices have in the past been outmoded bysocial changes. The situation of Oxford and Cambridge during the first twothirds of the nineteenth century is a case in point. For two generations manyleaders of public opinion argued for the need of either establishing modernuniversities in England or reforming the two ancient seats of learning.Eventually both courses of action were followed; the modification of Oxford andCambridge by successive royal commissions was so radical as to constitute theequivalent of a series of drastic biological mutations. By the end of thecentury English universities were once again well adapted to the tasks athand.<p><p><p>I should like to approach the subject of education for the professions in themood of the comparative educationalist. I should like to examine in particularthe way the future members of the professions are recruited, selected, andeducated in certain European nations and the United States.<p><p><p>For a number of professions one phase of professional education--the finalstage, so to speak--is essentially identical in all countries. There is littleto be gained by noting the minor differences to be found in various nations.This is true of medicine, of engineering, and of the natural sciences; it islikewise true to a lesser degree of certain areas within the social sciencesand the humanities. It is possible to pass judgment on the work of the medicalfaculty of a university, for example, almost without taking into account thetraditions of the institution or its surroundings. Considering the training ofa medical man only from the standpoint of professional competency, it would notbe too difficult to classify all the medical schools of Europe and America intogroups according to their degree of excellence. The same would apply to thetraining of engineers and research Scientists.<p><p><p>It is not so much professional education as the education provided prior toprofessional studies that varies from nation to nation. This is particularlytrue if one directs attention to the way the future members of the professionsare recruited and selected. Nowhere on the European continent will one find theequivalent of the American four-year liberal arts college. The European youth,unlike his American contemporary. passes directly from a university preparatoryschool to professional training.<p><p><p>Americans find it difficult to imagine an educational system without a college;Europeans find it hard to imagine what sort of an institution an Americancollege can be. And the task of explaining the situation in the United Statesto a Germans for example is not made easier by the fact that there are over1;00 four-year colleges in our country, some part of a university, some not;their curricula and criteria for admission and graduation vary enormously;' theone thing they have in common is the right to award a bachelor's degree. anacademic symbol derived from the Middle Ages which has completely disappearedin German-speaking nations, though not in France.<p><p><p>One sometimes hears it said that the characteristic feature of Americaneducation is the proportion of our youth attending a university. So phrasedthis is a completely misleading statement. What is characteristic is the verylarge proportion of our youth from eighteen to twenty years of age who arcengaged in full-time studies; the fraction is something like a quarter to athird; in Great Britain, France, Germany. and Switzerland not more than a tenthof the youth arc so engaged. Equally characteristic are the figures for schoolattendance at the ages sixteen to seventeen; in America more than 70 per centof those of this age arc in school full-time; in European countries and GreatBritain the corresponding figure is less than 20 per cont. Some Europeans havesaid that only a rich nation could afford to keep so many of its youth inschool so long. But with the increase in automation, it is a question whetherthe withdrawal of a considerable fraction of youth from the labor force is aluxury. The type of training needed in the distributive industries more andmore requires considerable "book learning."<p><p><p>At all events, when we consider the proportion of youth engaged in professionalstudies, the position of the United States is not so different from that of therest of the world. Perhaps it is fair to compare the proportion of young menenrolled in the first year of a university in Europe or Great Britain to theproportion in the United States entering engineering, law, and medical schoolsand starting in the graduate schools of arts and sciences. Taking the figuresfor young men, the proportion in the United States seems to be something like 6per cent; surprisingly small, many would say. But X hat is equally surprisingis that similar figures represent the situation in all nations for Which I haveseen statistics. Therefore, one could say that the proportion of youth studyingprofessionally in a university is about the same in the United States as inother nations. What is different between America and Europe is the method bywhich this very small percentage is selected and educated prior to engaging inprofessional studies.<p><p><p>Today. unlike the situation of a hundred years ago, the education of members ofthe professions (particularly natural scientists and engineers) is a concern ofstatesmen: public opinion has an interest in hearing the answers to suchquestions as the following: Are we training enough professional people? Are weincluding in our education for the professions a large fraction of those whohave the requisite ability. or are we overlooking many with highpotentialities.<p><p><p>In a totalitarian state these questions lead directly to a control of theentire educational process; the capable are to be sorted out and educated forthe different professions according to the nation's need for these professions.This is essentially the directive of the Party Executive Committee to those incharge of schools and universities in the Soviet Zone of Germany. In a freecountry the political situation is, thank God. very different, not only becauseof the impossibility of governments ordering youth into different educationalchannels but because of the freedom of parents to express their desires toschool authorities and, if need be, to politicians.<p><p><p>National concern with the number and quality of scientists and engineers isclearly a result of the last phases of the industrial revolution which startedtwo hundred years ago. Parental concern with education as a way by which a sonmay better himself economically and socially is a con; sequence of the spreadof that spirit of democracy of which Tocqueville wrote more than a century ago.It has taken time for the equalitarian doctrines of the French Revolutionreinforced by American notions to affect European education; but there is nodoubt that the problem of selecting future university students is becoming morerather than less difficult in England and a number of European states. Thequestion of social prestige is becoming involved, as it has been involved withus in America for at least fifty years.<p><p><p>Let me give a few concrete examples. During the Second World War the BritishParliament made certain changes in the English system of tax supported schools.Among the objectives which the new legislation sought to achieve was thewidening of opportunity for children of the less well to do; another was anelimination of the great difference in prestige that in the past hadcharacterized' one type of tax supported school as compared to another. Thetraditional view of the content of a school program was, however not modified.A long course was held to be necessary; and selection of those capable ofentering those schools which provided this course was to be made at the age ofeleven to twelve.<p><p><p>From the point of view of a parent with a low income and a talented child, thenew arrangement must appear to be better than the old. But parents of mediumincome view the altered situation highly critically. In the past, the ';grammarschools" had provided excellent roads to the universities open to those whocould afford to pay a moderate fee. (For well-to-do families the usual road tothe university is provided by the famous "public schools.") The new regulationsabolished the fees and made the admission of all children subject to acompetitive examination. And to make matters worse, so some parents have said,a new type of examination is employed--so-called psychological tests--that hasno apparent relation to school work! As a result the whole subject of selectionat age eleven-plus is a topic of heated discussion among educators andlaymen.<p><p><p>In one county in England the experiment is being made of abolishing theexamination in two Selected geographic areas and sending all children fromeleven to fifteen to one school and then providing grammar school places forthose whose parents are willing to keep them in school until at least sixteen.Presumably ability to handle the work in the grammar school will be thedetermining factor in deciding who goes on to the university. The article inthe London Observer reviewing the experiment carries the heading "Eleven plusCondemned." This caption corresponds to the sentiment expressed in a number ofarticles and letters to the editor that have been appearing in British journalsand papers in the last few years.<p><p><p>On the European continent, too, difficulties have arisen in regard to theprocess of selecting those who are to attend the Gymnasium in preparation for auniversity education. Each one of eleven states in the Federal Republic ofGermany has complete authority in educational matters; so too have thetwenty-five cantons in Switzerland (with a few exceptions). A comparison of theroads to the university in each of these states is interesting; it shows howdifferent local conditions have modified to a certain degree the Europeanpattern. The points at issue are often the exact length of the pre-universityschool course and the methods by which pupils are selected for the specialpre-university schools.<p><p><p>The parental pressure varies greatly from place to place and reflectsdifferences in tradition and economic circumstances. Sometimes the selectioncan be made solely on the basis of advice given by teachers and accepted byparents. Sometimes examinations are required in order to decide who shouldstart on the road to the professions. If so, parental protests frequentlyarise. In one German state I heard a mother complaining that the entrance testsfor the Gymnasium were so foolish and arbitrary that many of her friends couldnot get their children admitted. as a consequence the parents were pressed intothe expense of sending them to private schools. in France, where the road tothe professions has been studded with stiff competitive examinations, anguishover the selection process has been particularly acute. The entranceexaminations for the pre-university schools (Lycees) have just been abolishedand the program in these schools lightened. Selection of the pupils who headfor the university is now to be made on the basis of the primary school record.In Switzerland, the psychological effect on the child of failure in thepre-university school (in some cantons a half to two thirds drop out) is givingconcern to the school authorities.<p><p><p>In several German states, parents have brought suit against the governmentbecause a child had been barred from a pre-university school. The matter haseven become a political issue. It is not the method of selection but the lengthof the pre-university school course that is in controversy. If the course isnine years, then selection must be made at the age of ten to eleven; this wasthe usual pattern in Germany, I judge, some years ago. But in the post-waryears in some states the pre-university course was shortened and the time ofselection correspondingly postponed.<p><p><p> The arguments in favor of keeping all the children together in one school aslong as possible are familiar to Americans; an additional (and for Europeansmore weighty) argument for a shorter pre-university period of schooling is thatit may be easier to select those suited for university work at twelve orthirteen rather than ten or eleven. The abbreviated course has been attacked,however, on the grounds that nine years is necessary if the pupil is to masterthe subjects required for later university work (particularly Latin). Thedifferences of opinion on the matter seem to run along the usual lines ofpolitical cleavage in both Germany and Switzerland; in general the moderateright favors the longer course, the moderate left the shorter.<p><p><p>In one state election in Germany the issue was of major importance This is hardfor Americans to understand, since the difference of opinion appears to berelatively slight and the educational question involved touches the schoolingof not more than a fifth of the children. It is interesting to us as evidenceof the intimate connection between school problems and sociologicalquestions.<p><p><p>From what I have already reported, it is clear that the age at which selectionis made and the time it is made is intimately associated with the content ofthe pre-university course of study. And here eve meet the second majordifference between the road to the professions in Europe and in the UnitedStates. In Europe, the state determines the requirements which must besatisfactorily fulfilled in order to obtain, on finishing school, the necessarycredentials which w ill enable the holder to enter a university. In Germany andSwitzerland, for example, the certificate which a youth obtains after passing aset of final examinations in the last school year is an admission ticket to auniversity. The absence of any such uniform requirements in America astonishesand perplexes the European observer of our chaotic system<p><p><p>Though each state in the Federal Republic of Germany is autonomous, thestandards throughout arc essentially the same. Certain variations in thesubjects on which a student is examined are permitted, but one may say that theessential subjects are languages and mathematics. In the classical Gymnasium(in Germany called the humanistic school), Latin and Greek are obligatory; inmost of the others, Latin and at least one modern foreign language; in a fewschools, exposure to a heavy dose of modern languages, mathematics, and naturalscience is considered a substitute for Latin. A European university is not anAmerican college. and language instruction is not one of its functions;scientists, lawyers, medical men, economists, and historians, there fore, haveno opportunity for studying any language after they leave school. With this inmind, one realizes why a long school course is believed necessary for futureuniversity students. The central position occupied in the curricula ofpre-university schools by foreign languages is a reflection of the role playedby both tradition and geography in educational matters. As far as futureprofessional men are concerned, Europeans are convinced that the traditionaleducation in languages, literature, mathematics, and European history comprisesthe best general education.<p><p><p>For the 70 or 80 per cent who have no ambition or no opportunity to head for auniversity, formal full-time education ends at fourteen or fifteen; furthereducational development in part-time courses will depend on the occupation ofthe young man or woman in question. The apprentice system together withcontinuation schools takes care of industrial workers, it may be said. Forapprentices with special mechanical aptitude, technical schools are available.For the 10 per cent or so who must drop out of the pre-university schools, somespecial type of education with more emphasis on practical business affairs isneeded. This the European would grant, but the idea of a general education fora large proportion of adolescents aged sixteen to twenty-one is unheard of onthe continent of Europe.<p><p><p>How is it at the end of the road, one may ask, Are those Europeans who completethe hard journey and arrive at a university and later become professional men(some 6 per cent of the young men) better educated than the correspondingAmericans? This is the type of question a comparative educationalist refuses toanswer. For so much depends on your standard of judgment, on what basis youevaluate the nonprofessional knowledge, ability, and attitude of a professionalman or woman.<p><p><p>One thing is certain: the average American medical man, lawyer, chemist,physicist, or engineer has acquired a quite different store of generalknowledge from that of his European counterpart. If command of foreignlanguages is the test of a well-educated man or woman, relatively few Americanscan claim to be well educated. If knowledge of European literature and art istaken as a measure, there again the average American professional man will failin comparison with the Europeans. European pre-university education is inessence literary education; American college education can rarely be so adescribed.<p><p><p> On the other hand, every American in school and in college will have sampledat Least a bit of some of the social sciences. Indeed, perhaps the majority ofthose whom we are here considering will have acquired a considerable knowledgeof economics and political science; a large proportion will have studiedpsychology and sociology. With rare exceptions these disciplines are onlyavailable to a European in a university; and while the student enrolled underthe law faculty may find time to listen to some lectures in these fields, themedical man and natural scientist will not.<p><p><p>In other words, those Americans who complete at least three years of afour-year liberal arts college course will have had a kind of academicexperience unknown on the continent of Europe. (A possible exception to thisstatement is the education provided for the future teachers in thepre-university schools who are educated in the famous Ecole Normale in Parisand in the philosophical faculties of the German universities.)<p><p><p>But it is not only the content of the program which characterizes the Americancollege. The whole atmosphere is different from either a European school or aEuropean university. There is far more freedom for the student than in aschool, of course, and there is far more personal instruction of the student bythe professor than is possible in a university of the European type with itsrelatively small staff in proportion to the size of the student body. TheAmerican student is ready to express an opinion to anyone; discussion isencouraged at every turn. Student activities ranging from dramatics throughdebating and journalism stimulate student independence; there is no parallel tothese expressions of student initiative in Europe. All of which, of course,reflects what Americans have come to believe are important aspects of collegeeducation.<p><p>Indeed, one can sum up the comparison I have been making by saying that theleading citizens of Europe and the United States have quite different aims inmind when they talk about education as apart from professional training. Andthe difference reflects the different social histories on the two sides of theAtlantic.<p><p><p>As a first approximation, one may say that Europe adjusted its education tomodern times nearly a hundred years ago. A period of rapid educational changeon the Continent took place in the middle of the nineteenth century; thisreflected the first impact of industrialization. The pattern thus establishedhas persisted to the present with relatively few changes; it is obviouslyintimately associated with the apprentice system of training industrial workersand a relative lack of geographic and social mobility. It also reflects thepowerful influence of the university faculties which were well entrenched whenthe educational changes were in progress--particularly the influence of theprofessors of the classics.<p><p><p>During the period of change in the United States in which we are still living,traditional academic forces have played a far less important role. But suchsocial factors as the raising of the school-leaving age in the United Statesand the near disappearance of the European apprentice system were of moreimportance in determining the shape of the new educational system which is nowemerging.<p><p><p>I have written "emerging" because it is dear that in this country we are stillill process of adapting our schools, colleges, and universities to the currentneeds of our society (and trying to adapt to future needs as well). In England,too, a process of change has been and still is at work. In the nations ofWestern Europe, on the other hand (with the exception of Scandinavia), fewalterations in the systems have been made in the last fifty years; though thereare many educational problems similar to our own and England's, a period ofreform has not yet begun.<p><p><p>An American observer cannot help wondering if such a period is not considerablyoverdue. It may well be that the more immediate political and social issues inFrance and the urgent task of reconstruction in post-war Germany have merelypushed aside consideration of educational changes. I seem to detect signs ofdissatisfaction in the Federal Republic of Germany which may be the prelude toimportant actions; in parts of Switzerland the road to the professions is beingresurveyed. In France a few important changes have just been made, and a billproviding for a drastic alteration in the French system has been introducedinto Parliament by the Minister of Education.<p><p><p>We here in the United States are still engaged in remaking our educationalroads; the nature of the task varies considerably from state to state, fromcommunity to community. Pedagogic devices and plans for the organization ofschools and universities are not always transferable across state lines; theyare almost never exportable to foreign countries. But nonetheless the exchangeof ideas and blueprints is always helpful because it stimulates and arousesdiscussion.<p><p><p>We may watch with interest, therefore, the new developments in those Westernnations from which came originally our cultural traditions and our ideas abouteducation. The free nations of the world in planning for their youth, as inmany other matters, muse be in constant communication, for however diversetheir methods their fundamental aims remain the same: the preservation andextension of personal freedom.<p></blockquote><p><p><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1940 by James Bryant Conant.

Hardlyanyone is listening. Several council members huddle in an intense private debate; mostof the newspaper reporters have stepped outside to smoke; one participant, head thrownback, seems transfixed by the hideous chandelier hanging above him.<p>The soporific scene is suddenly interrupted by a squeaky-voiced councilwoman, who takesthe microphone to complain that too few of the urban-improvement proposals areaddressing the needs of black residents. "This body is doing virtually nothing for thepeople of the townships," she declares shrilly, wagging a finger at her colleagues."We're spending all this time considering the suburbs when we should be attending tothe thousands of people who have no homes and no basic services. We're supposed to bedelivering to them."<p>One year after the moving spectacle that was South Africa's first democratic election,the country is still battling to undo apartheid. The task is not an easy one,especially here in Johannesburg, South Africa's largest city. To legislate awaywhite-minority rule at the national level--as happened, in essence, in the 1994elections-was one thing; to abolish apartheid locally, where it has assumed some of itsmost odious forms, is quite another. What is to be done with Johannesburg's thirteenracially designated local authorities, which employ some 30,000 people? How is a singletax base to be created? Where should the boundary lines for a unified city be drawn?And what about the decades of gross neglect of black communities--an estimated 200,000people without running water, an equal number without adequate housing? <P>Nevertheless, among the country's hundreds of racially divided municipalities,Johannesburg was thought to have one of the best shots at consolidating. That's becausefor four long years--starting well before the transition to black-majority rule--aneclectic array of bureaucrats, consultants, and anti-government activists had beenthrashing out the fine points of trash collection and toilet installation in apost-apartheid South Africa. (The process was described by one participant as "partgroup-therapy session, part crash course in municipal administration.") By the time thenew government ordered the cities to merge their various councils, Johannesburg seemedset to become one of the nation's first racially unified urban areas.<P>It didn't happen. Instead the city became the arena for a vicious power struggle withinthe now ruling <A HREF="http://www.anc.org.za/lists/locgov.html">African NationalCongress</A> party-a struggle fueled in large part, critics contend, by the inexperienced, third-rate politicians representing the ANC at the locallevel. The problem is one that plagues the entire country, because most of the ANC'sseasoned leaders have gone to work in the upper echelons of government. But the ANC'sdeficiencies at the local level are perhaps nowhere better illustrated than in thetortuous gestation of the Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council, orTMC. Starry-eyed plans, detailed diagrams, consultants' recommendations to remakeJohannesburg-virtually all have fallen victim to political skirmishes. Indeed, thingsgot so bad not long ago that arbiters had to intervene.<P>None of this, obviously, bodes well for the country's future. Government affectspeople's daily lives most at the local level: that is where the promises to redressapartheid's injustices must be kept, where the real changes in South Africa will befelt, where democracy will either succeed or stumble. "If this city can't be made towork as one," Mark Swilling, a political scientist at Johannesburg's University of theWitwatersrand, told me recently, "then what happens at the top, what happensnationally, will be mostly irrelevant." <P>To be sure, even the harshest critics concede that Johannesburg, as the country'sbiggest and most complicated metropolis, was bound to have the biggest and mostcomplicated issues to resolve. Several of South Africa's other major cities are alsohaving difficulty doing away with apartheid, although not all for the same reasons.Smaller municipalities, beset by simpler problems, have been able to move ahead fasterwith unification. <P><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><font size=5>N</font>othing is simple about the mess that is greater Johannesburg, theproduct of numerous statutes over the past century to prevent people of color from living in, or even near, whitecommunities. Among these statutes, the Group Areas Act of 1950, which guaranteed totalresidential segregation by race, is perhaps the most responsible for having definedJohannesburg's demographic contours. Group Areas provided the legal justification forevicting whole neighborhoods of blacks from the whites-only city. (One such section,known as Sophiatown, was renamed Triomf-"Triumph"-by its white tenants.) And GroupAreas was the rationale for dumping the dispossessed in makeshift townships twenty orthirty miles away, desolate places that had little infrastructure or industry andreceived little financial help from the government. Unlike U.S. cities, which havedecayed from the center outward, Johannesburg is ringed by its destitute areas-acondition the South African economist Richard Tomlinson likens to a "too-tight beltaround a very fat stomach." (The demographics changed somewhat in 1988, when GroupAreas was amended to allow blacks to live in certain parts of the city; the law wasabolished altogether in 1991.)<p>To understand the implications of the patterns of settlement, it is helpful to viewJohannesburg the way Tshepiso Mashinini often does while he reconnoiters the city.Mashinini, an adviser to the TMC, is typical of South African urban activists: young,bright, intense, utterly dedicated. On this day he begins his reconnaissance at the topof Munro Drive, a long, steep road that winds through Upper Houghton, one ofJohannesburg's poshest sections. At a lookout point Mashinini gazes down on theaffluent northern suburbs, a verdant crazy quilt of sweeping lawns, stately homes,swimming pools, tennis courts, office parks, and shopping malls. But he doesn't see alush emerald vista; he sees a waste of space and resources. According to his research,the residential density in these suburbs-fifteen homes to every 2.5 acres, three peopleto a household-is about half that of Soweto, the sprawling black township to the south.In fact, the facilities are so plentiful in this part of town that Mashinini figuresthat 500,000 people could move in tomorrow and not even begin to strain the mainsewerage line. "This isn't the free market at work," he says, gesturing at the scenebelow. "This is apartheid legislation."<P>From Munro Drive, Mashinini heads south on the M-1 freeway to Soweto, at the far end ofthe too-tight belt. Along the way he mutters to himself as he notices nicely manicuredsoccer fields and parks and public swimming pools-all empty, all "underutilized," inTMC parlance. Mashinini transfers to the M-2 freeway and heads west for several mileson Main Reef Road, the major artery into Soweto. He passes the huge mounds of miningwaste that act as a buffer between the township and white areas, and billboardsadvertising maize meal (the main staple for black South Africans) and a Japaneseelectronics firm, and suddenly comes upon Soweto. It is as if he has crossed a frontierinto another country.<P>Seen from a distance, Soweto is utterly lacking in green; the tiny "matchbox" housesthat march in rigid rows all the way to the horizon are a monochromatic brown. Theroads are narrow and rutted; most of the side streets are unpaved. Many are adornedwith mountains of decomposing garbage. Squatter camps-pathetic places filled withcorrugated-iron shacks and rivers of raw sewage-litter the hillsides. This township ofmore than two million people (no one really knows the number), a city a little largerthan Houston, has one cinema, one sports stadium, one shopping mall, some fast-foodjoints, and a handful of grocery and liquor stores. People spend hours every daycommuting to Johannesburg, where the jobs are. "There is nothing here because apartheidzoning was a vise-grip this tight," Mashinini says, making a fist. "It deliberatelysquashed most opportunities for commercial or industrial development."<P>But the three city councils for the area that made up greater Soweto, like all localauthorities in the country, were supposed to be self-sufficient-something of animpossibility, given their tax base of impoverished residents. Consider thesestatistics: Johannesburg's old city council had 22,000 workers and an annual budget ofclose to $1 billion to serve about 900,000 people; the councils of greater Soweto, witha population more than twice as large, employed only about 3,000 people and had abudget of less than $100 million. This helps explain why, for instance, Johannesburghauled away almost 700,000 tons of refuse in 1993, while greater Soweto disposed ofonly 400,000 tons.<P>"Soweto is a dump," Mashinini declares as he stops in front of the house where he spenthis childhood, 934 Pitso Street. It is a typical matchbox house: four small roomsinside, pit latrine and cold-water tap outside. Mashinini and his twelve siblings hadto sleep squeezed together on the floor in the living room, the kitchen, or whereverthey could find space. To bathe, they boiled water on a coal-burning stove. NowMashinini lives in a proper house in Yeoville, an artsy section of Johannesburg thatused to be a Jewish neighborhood. "Growing up in Soweto, you always knew it was adump," he continues. "But I never realized how bad it really was until I moved out. NowI walk down the street to my local bar, a restaurant, the cinema. When the electricitygoes out, I call the city council, and they come to fix it immediately. Workmen arealways repairing potholes. Here in Soweto they never did anything." <P><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><font size=5>T</font>he plans to redesign Johannesburg were born precisely of that frustration. Fed up with thetownship's miserable conditions and the largely discredited city councils, Soweto'scivic activists in 1986 launched a widespread rent-and-utilities boycott. At first thenational government ignored their demands; the mid-1980s were a time of great politicalupheaval, and the Soweto rent strike was just one of dozens throughout the country. Butthe boycott dragged on, pulling Soweto's councils deeper and deeper into debt andforcing the provincial administration to hand over more than $100 million-money meantfor white areas-to keep them afloat. The government clearly had to find a way to endthe strike.<p>The solution materialized in the form of the Soweto People's Delegation, a group thatincluded Cyril Ramaphosa, then the head of the mine workers' union. (Ramaphosa iscurrently the ANC's secretary-general.) In 1989 the SPD published a paper showing thatSoweto's blacks were, in essence, subsidizing white Johannesburg. The argument wentsomething like this: since Johannesburg got 70 percent of its income from industry andcommerce, and since blacks did most of the work, and since Johannesburg didn't put apenny into the township where its workers lived, wealth, in effect, was moving fromSoweto to Johannesburg, which gave its homeowners rebates of up to 55 percent on theirproperty taxes. The paper caused a huge stir; its call for "one city, one tax base"became the rallying cry of township activists throughout South Africa-and the basisupon which the SPD negotiated an end to the rent boycott.<P>Ramaphosa began talking to officials from the provincial government and Soweto'scouncils in October of 1989. After months of fourteen-hour-a-day discussions,Ramaphosa-a shrewd and articulate bargainer who would ultimately help to negotiate thetransition to majority rule-proposed a settlement: the boycott would be called off ifthe government agreed to forgive the millions of dollars owed in arrears to thetownship councils, to charge a flat fee for utilities, and to work toward the creationof a unified city with a single tax base. The issue of inferior services in thetownships, Ramaphosa contended, couldn't be resolved without addressing the largerproblem from which it stemmed: Johannesburg's artificial division along raciallines.<P>Thus, while Ramaphosa continued negotiating to end the Soweto boycott (a final accordwouldn't be ratified for another three years), the multiracial Central WitwatersrandMetropolitan Chamber was formed. ("Central Witwatersrand" refers to the greaterJohannesburg area.) Completely voluntary, and initially without any statutory powers,it nonetheless had a breathtakingly broad mandate. At least that's how itsmembers-representatives from civic groups, the provincial government, and the area'scity councils-interpreted matters. They divided themselves into several wide-rangingcommittees to which they attached ponderous names: the Constitutional DevelopmentWorking Group, the Physical Development Working Group, the Social Development WorkingGroup, and so on. Each working group had numerous subcommittees, or task teams, allbearing equally ponderous names. Adrian Enthoven, who was the chamber's operationsmanager, estimates that about a thousand people-consultants, task-team members,technicians, economists, engineers-had a hand in the negotiations.<P>The exercise was excruciating, given the enmity and distrust that existed between theopposing sides. White bureaucrats typically saw the civic activists ascommunist-inspired anarchists, hell-bent on overthrowing the government and installinga Stalinist regime. For their part, the activists considered the bureaucrats to beextensions of the apartheid apparatus: many had been intimately involved in thegovernment's last-gasp attempt, in the 1980s, to preserve white rule by putting thesesame activists behind bars, improving the townships a bit, and using the improvement tolure blacks into accepting a limited political dispensation. <P>But those endless hours of discussion in the chamber seemed to work a kind oftransmutation in all the parties. "It was a fascinating thing to observe," saysFrederik van Zyl Slabbert, who was the chamber's chairman and is now in charge ofplanning local-government elections. "The civic associations came into the chamber withfoam in the mouth, and the provincial government came in accustomed to saying 'Take itor leave it.' After a while the civics began to appreciate the complexities ofadministration, and the province began to understand that there was a real crisis oflegitimacy in township government."<P>Patrick Fitzgerald, who chaired one of the chamber committees, likens the experience tothe scene in <I>Annie Hall</I> in which Woody Allen visits Diane Keaton's gentilefamily and imagines that every time they look at him, they see a rabbi complete withbeard, side curls, and a long black coat. In the case of Fitzgerald, who spent severalyears in exile as a member of the then-outlawed ANC, the representatives of theprovincial government and the white city councils saw Che Guevara. "When they peeredover at me, I was sure they saw a beard, red beret, army fatigues, AK-47," recallsFitzgerald, who sports the smallest of moustaches, has cropped hair, and wearsOxford-cloth shirts. Eventually, he says, they stopped peering.<P>The working groups concluded that making Johannesburg one city and achieving racialintegration would best be done through economic redress. Although many of the blackresidents with financial means would probably move to white suburbs once apartheid lawswere lifted, they represented a minuscule percentage of township dwellers, most of whomwere too poor to move. Thus the chamber set as its goal a "compact integrated city"-onethat would merge Johannesburg with the townships by building low-income housing onthousands of acres of vacant land close to town and putting to use the excess amongexisting installations and facilities. By all means improve the townships, the thinkingwent, but also concentrate on righting the huge imbalances caused by apartheid'sdraconian zoning laws; "densification" was the key word here-and one that terrifiedmany white residents. For them, it conjured up visions of black squatters crowding intotheir back yards; an irate suburbanite who attended a presentation put on by thechamber shouted out that it was "Marxist-style engineering."<P>As for creating a single tax base, the working groups suggested the establishment ofthe Transitional Metropolitan Council. They envisioned the TMC as a kind ofsupra-municipal Big Brother: modeled after Toronto's governing body, it would havepower over seven newly delineated local authorities, collecting taxes from them andfrom the downtown business district and redirecting the money where necessary-thus, inessence, creating a single tax base. If funds were required, say, to build a road inSoweto, the TMC could draw on revenues from the rich northern suburbs. The principleapplied to redistributing other resources as well: the TMC would have the power toorder suburban sanitation workers and their garbage trucks into Soweto to help clean upthe township-thereby integrating the racially segregated municipal work forces. <P>Some chamber participants wax rhapsodic about the negotiating exercise. "Decolonizationon the African continent has been a deal among elites," Mark Swilling, thepolitical-science professor, who also served as a member of the Metropolitan Chamber,contends. "That didn't happen here. This was a complex process of dialogue, acollective learning experience, a massive change in the management process. How elsecould you begin to break down our racially structured imagination?" (Swilling's formerchamber colleague Lawrence Boya asks, more bluntly, "How do you get people who thoughtof us in the past as monkeys, as baboons, to deliver services to us?") But many saw theMetropolitan Chamber as a group of naive dreamers, dazed by unrealistic expectationsand the piles of papers they had produced, and lacking political constituencies thatwould hold them accountable. Steven Friedman, of the Centre for Policy Studies, anindependent research group, speaks of messianic elements in the chamber. "All thosegrand millenarian visions, that rhetoric about people's empowerment, was nonsense andrubbish," he says. "If you looked at what the new local government was inheriting,there clearly wasn't going to be any magical transformation." <P><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><font size=5>I</font>ndeed, when the time came actually to implement the chamber's plans, the consequences ofhaving carried out negotiations in a virtual political vacuum became clear. The ANCfinally joined the chamber at the end of 1993, and expectations that Johannesburg wouldbecome one of the first consolidated cities quickly evaporated. The ANC delegatesdemanded that all work be stopped and an audit be conducted; they were intenselysuspicious of anything they themselves hadn't developed. They insisted on beingallocated two thirds of the seats in a newly constituted TMC, because, they explained,the ANC had polled that percentage in the national election. The fifty-two otherorganizations in the chamber decried this as demagoguery. <p>The ANC representatives also rejected the working groups' idea that a single tax basecould be created simply by establishing a strong TMC. The minute the TMC tried to tapinto revenues, they warned, the white local authorities would challenge its powers incourt. Instead the ANC proposed carving up greater Johannesburg into three giganticlocal authorities, each one incorporating parts of the poor townships and the richsuburbs. In this way all impoverished areas would be guaranteed a viable tax basewithout having to rely on the TMC. That assumed, of course, that the local authoritiesthemselves would be viable-something disputed by just about everyone who hadparticipated in the chamber. Critics claimed that the idea was absurd, unwieldy,unworkable; one municipality alone would measure more than forty miles from end to end.But the ANC refused to budge, and the battles dragged on for months before all sidesagreed to submit to arbitration. <P>In the meantime, deadline after deadline passed for getting the new municipalitiesgoing. Chamber members who themselves were card-carrying supporters of the ANC foundthe delays particularly dismaying. After all, they were the ones who had continued theANC's struggle within the country after the party was banned, in the 1960s, and itsleaders forced into exile. As civic activists they had lived dangerous, clandestinelives. Many assumed that when the ANC was made legal and allowed to operate openly inSouth Africa, as it was in 1990, the party would grant them leadership roles at thelocal level. Instead the civic activists found themselves being shoved to thesidelines-and by people whom they and others considered to be grossly inept. <P>"The moral of the story is that the ANC at the local level finds independent grassrootspolitics very threatening," Steven Friedman says. "If you're a party member, you're notsupposed to paddle your own canoe. But at the same time the national ANC doesn't caremuch about local politics either. So the party replaced those competent elites who hadbeen talking about urban issues for four years with C-grade politicians."<P>Indeed, the ANC admits its insistence on strict loyalty. "Just being a member of theANC doesn't grant you authority to do as you like," says Collin Matjila, the party'schief city councillor for Johannesburg. "You have to adhere to the ANC position." ButMatjila disputes the notion that the party's perhaps-less-than-illustriousrepresentation at the local level implies a lack of interest. "Even those at theprovincial and national levels weren't necessarily skilled in governance. Where do[critics] expect our people to have gotten this experience?"<P>Much of this drama could be dismissed as petty politics but for the effect it is havingon the country's demographic and economic heartland. Johannesburg's TMC has beenworking since December-but barely. The arbiters ultimately ruled in favor of a strongTMC, which was to oversee seven subordinate local authorities; the ANC's Matjila vowedto fight the decision. Indeed, the ANCand the province's Demarcation Board have nowproposed dividing the area into four local authorities, only to be thwarted byopposition political parties in the TMC. At press time these parties appeared poised totake the Demarcation Board to court, a move that could delay the local elections thatwere scheduled to be held in November-and thus postpone the installation of a permanentlocal government.<P>At the ANC's behest many of the chamber's proposals remain shelved; TMC members seem tospend much of their time discussing the minutes of previous meetings. Meanwhile, a lotof the city's major problems are going unattended. Enticed by an ANC promise to build150,000 houses in the province within twelve months of the national elections, tens ofthousands of homeless people have invaded tracts of vacant land throughout themetropolis. TMC officials and the police are frequently called upon to evictsquatters-evictions that often turn angry and violent. In recent years other similarlymilitant squatters, desperate for shelter, took over whole buildings that were standingempty in downtown Johannesburg.<P>Remedying these problems requires precisely the skills and knowledge that participantsin the Metropolitan Chamber acquired; but most of them, disgusted by the politicalinfighting and the ANC's seeming disregard for their work, haven't joined the TMC. Gonewith them are the relationships they forged with the white bureaucrats in the municipalunions-vital players who, quite literally, make the city work (or not, if they are soinclined). Dominique Wooldridge, a researcher at the University of Witwatersrand'sbusiness school, contends that there is an urgent need to engage in dialogue with theunions about a whole range of labor-relations issues related to integration. Such adialogue has begun; if it breaks down, the discontent of these unions could result instrikes that might jeopardize the establishment of new multiracial metropolitanstructures-and paralyze greater Johannesburg.<P>But the bureaucrats don't have to engage in such dramatic gestures to wreak havoc. "Ifthe management changes are unilaterally ordered by the politicians, then I foreseegreat resistance among my members," warns Theo Crouse, the general secretary of theJohannesburg Municipal Employees Association, a union of 7,000 officials. "I'm nottalking about burning down buildings but about a more subtle approach to sabotage.Remember, the knowledge and information about running these cities rests with us. So ifa clerk in the treasurer's department receives a remittance by mail and decides not toopen the envelope, then the city isn't going to have any money deposited into itsaccounts. And it can't very well operate without money."<P>Perhaps most disturbing is the effect all this may have on the local elections.Political analysts see the months before the poll as critical. They are a window ofopportunity to begin delivering the services denied township residents during thedecades of apartheid-a brief moment of grace in which black South Africans might givelocal government a chance to prove it is something other than neglectful, abusive, andcorrupt. <P>If a lesson can be learned from Johannesburg's experience, perhaps it is the glaringlyobvious one that doing away with apartheid won't be easily accomplished. Critics of theMetropolitan Chamber argue that Johannesburg should have restricted itself to narrowlydefined goals and not tried to reverse years of injustice all at once. They point toPort Elizabeth, a municipality of about a million people in the Eastern Province, whichfocused on writing a new constitution for the city and its townships, and on combiningtheir budgets; as a result, a unified Port Elizabeth is up and running successfully.But the larger the metropolis, the more complex the issues-no matter what approach istaken. Indeed, both Cape Town and Durban, the country's other large cities, are havingserious problems consolidating. Although the specifics differ, in both cities-as inJohannesburg-too many competing political interests need to be considered, too manyegos gratified.<P>And so, Steven Friedman says, Johannesburg will limp along. "It's not very effectivepolitical management, but history works in years and decades, not minutes and months.Still, I see it as a lost opportunity. This country needs to develop functional andvigorous local government if it's going to work-and what happens to Johannesburg willhave a major influence on what happens to South Africa as a whole." </blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=17 border=0 ALT = "Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=44 height=17 border=0 ALT = "Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

Wallerstein and <br>Sandra Blakeslee.</i><br><i>HoughtonMifflin, 352 pages, <br>$24.95. </i> <p><font size=5>F</font>ABULOUS divorce used to be theprerogative of the rich and famous, but not anymore. Over the past threedecades, as divorce has become fully democratized, there has been a growingdemand by the "little people" (in Leona Helmsley's memorable phrase) for thesecrets of fabulous divorce. And who better to instruct the masses thanAmerica's most celebrated ex-wife, Ivana Trump?Since her high-profile split from Donald, Ivana's life and fortunes haveimproved. She has ventured into fiction with two novels, <i>For Love Alone</i>and <i>Free to Love</i>, and has moved into a successful sales career with hersignature line of clothing, cosmetics, and jewelry, now available on the HomeShopping Network. Better still, since her divorce she has lost weight, gained anew beau, and made the best-dressed list. Now Ivana seeks to reach other womengoing through divorce with the inspirational message in the title of her book:<i>The Best Is Yet to Come</i>. <p><A HREF="./art/ivana.htm"><img src="./art/ivana.gif" hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right border=0></A>Her book breaks new ground in one important way. Scores of advice books ondivorce have appeared over the past two decades, but in popular adviceliterature, as in so many other domains of life, there is a gender gap. Divorcebooks for women emphasize personal growth and liberation, while those for menemphasize "winning" at the game of divorce (typical examples are <i>DivorcedWomen, New Lives</i> for women, and <i>Winning Your Divorce:A Man's SurvivalGuide</i>). In <i>The Best Is Yet to Come</i>, Ivana bridges the gender gapwith the ultimate divorce fantasy. She shows women how to boost their savingsaccounts and their self-esteem, not to mention their faces and fannies. As sheputs it, divorce is the ultimate makeover.<p>On the financial-makeover side Ivana's advice is straightforward: "get yourselfa great settlement--and before you do, take his wallet to the cleaners." Ofcourse, some women don't know the first thing about their husbands' financialstatus, so it may be necessary to do some snooping and spying: "In this game wecall divorce, whoever has the most information wins." Ivana recommends a kindof grown-up version of a treasure hunt, in which wives search for clues totheir husbands' net worth by following a paper trail of credit-card bills, bankstatements--indeed, anything "that comes to the house with a dollar sign onit." Somewhere, she predicts, is the prize--that little piece of paper on whichmen write down what they're worth: stocks, cash, property, the whole caboodle."I don't know exactly why men do this," her financial guru shrugs. "I just knowthey do." You can almost hear the Czech-born Ivana heave a weary Old World sighof assent.<p>On the self-esteem and personal-growth side, divorce requires a completeoverhaul. Throwing out a spouse is like cleaning out a messy closet. You getrid of the stuff from last year and the mistakes from the year before, thedetritus and junk of the past. The emotional airing-out gives women a chance totake stock, to look at themselves critically. "Have you been living in thefashion past?" Ivana gently chides, before delivering the hardball truth:Marriage puts too many women in a rut. Married women lose their sense of self,their competitive edge, their initiative and independence. Their sex livesbecome boring and predictable. However upsetting and unexpected, therefore, thebreakup of a marriage brings a bracing shock of recognition: "I've been lettingmyself go."<p>Next Ivana suggests a good, cleansing shopping spree: "Get rid of your grungymarried-woman's underwear and go for the colors and the silks and the lace."The shopping spree is fun, a chance to take last revenge on yoursoon-to-be-ex's American Express card. But the hard work of the divorcemakeover lies ahead. Divorce is a chance to shed old skin: Ivana stronglyadvises the use of alphahydroxy acid, a key ingredient in her new Ivana line ofcosmetics, to exfoliate the skin. If you're still feeling saggy, she concedes,you may have to consult a plastic surgeon. "Explore. Experiment. See? There arevery nice words that start with `ex.'" <p><i>The Best Is Yet to Come</i> is a cross between <i>Lifestyles of the Rich andDivorced</i> and a Home Shopping Network infomercial. Ivana has the innocenceof the very rich ("Who knew cars had to be inspected once a year? Perhaps tillnow you had a driver who took care of such things"). But she also has theinstincts of a natural-born seller: "By the time this book is in your hands,"she writes on page five, "Ivana perfume will be available for you to enjoy." <p>In sharing the secrets of successful divorce, Ivana tries her darndest to bedemocratic. Her own revenge shopping spree focused on fancy bed linens("Pratesi and Frette--very expensive, but they'll last forever"), but sheexpresses sensitivity to women from all economic walks of life: "You can doplenty of damage in Caldor's." Still, as the ex-Mrs. Trump confesses, she's"more a Le Cirque person than a Taco Bell person," and her Le Cirque side takesover as she shares her secrets of how to dismiss household staff and how toshop for a good plastic surgeon and a personal trainer. It is hard to be mad atIvana, though, because every page or two you have to put down the book andlaugh. In fact, <i>The Best Is Yet to Come</i> is the funniest book on divorceI've ever read. <p>At the same time, it would be a mistake to treat the book as a joke. Like allgreat marketers, Ivana is culturally adept as well as commercially astute. Shehas a great feel for the mainstream values she seeks to exploit, and her book,properly read and appreciated, tells us much about what is distinctive aboutthe American way of divorce.<p>For one thing, Ivana's commercial exploitation of divorce is thoroughly in theAmerican grain. A century ago western state legislators and entrepreneurs madedivorce a staple of their economic-development strategy by setting theresidency requirement for divorce at a mere few months, attracting easternersto their hotels and resorts. Today the commerce in divorce has gone far beyondthe schemes of nineteenth-century entrepreneurs. Over the past three decades ahuge divorce industry, with a booming professional service sector of lawyers,therapists, financial experts, and child psychiatrists, has sprung up toharvest the fruits of family discord. The commercial tradition may help toexplain why polls show that Republicans are more tolerant of divorce thanDemocrats and why Republican leaders, for all their high-minded talk of familyvalues, are skittish about criticizing divorce. <p>If marketplace values are part of an established divorce tradition, divorce hasonly recently been harnessed to the great American tradition ofself-improvement. Nonetheless, the idea that marital breakup can contribute topersonal growth and fulfillment--a new and better you--has enormous appeal inthe nation with the highest divorce rate in the industrialized world. Althoughmost divorce-advice books cast self-improvement in psychological terms, as partof emotional growth, Ivana's approach harks back to a much older tradition:Ivana is the self-made woman, getting on in the world through pluck and luck(and a multimillion-dollar divorce settlement). Her view of the "game" ofdivorce is equally quaint, recalling the bad old days of fault-based divorce,when private detectives skulked around seedy motels, and wives looked forlipstick on collars. Nonetheless, her larger themes are central to thecontemporary divorce culture. The association of divorce with a new life, arenewed spirit, an awakening from a slumberous and zombie-like maritalexistence, pervades popular American thinking on marital breakup. Too, Ivana'spersona as a woman "made over" through her divorce reflects broader culturalideas about divorce as the means for women to take initiative and express theirindependence. Men may also use divorce to escape into a new identity, but men'spropensity to divorce is associated with classic forms of badbehavior--infidelity, alcoholism, violence --rather than with "growthful"change.  IF divorce provides opportunities for self-invention, marriage makes nocompeting cultural claims. In recent years marriage has been identified withstasis, stagnation, or, worse, oppression and depression. Of course, Americanshaven't given up on marriage entirely, but there is evidence of growingdisenchantment. Both marriage and remarriage rates are declining, while lessformal, more easily dissoluble unions are on the rise. This disenchantment mayexplain why marriage attracts so little attention from family researchers. Infact, if you wander through college bookstores looking for scholarly studies onthe subject, you might easily conclude from the meager offerings that marriageis a cultic practice, remote from everyday life and concerns. Now Judith Wallerstein, a clinical psychologist who has spent many yearsstudying divorcing couples and their children, turns her eye on marriage. Iknow Wallerstein, and therefore I can say with some confidence that she is nota booster of marriage at all costs. However, in <i>The Good Marriage</i>, astudy of fifty happily married couples, including some in second marriages, sheand the writer Sandra Blakeslee offer a remarkably sunny and affecting portraitof marriage and its satisfactions. What we learn is that a good marriage fallsinto the art of the possible.<p>Contrary to the view that marriage stunts personal growth, Wallerstein treatsmarriage as psychologically dynamic, requiring spouses to change over time inresponse to each other and also to develop the capacity to adjust to externalchange. This dynamic potential is the source of her cautious optimism about thepossibility of a good marriage. Marriages that work offer strong evidence that"adults have an enormous capacity to continue to grow," just as happy secondmarriages, with their potential to rekindle trust and love, offer the strongestargument for divorce, according to Wallerstein. Perhaps the most touchingstories in the book deal with "rescue marriages," in which people who havegrown up in less than perfect families--even some who have experiencedtraumatic emotional or physical abuse--create marriages that "undo earliersuffering" and repair psychic damage. <p>Unlike Tolstoy's happy families, however, happy marriages are not all alike.These partnerships range from the traditional, with sharp gender divisions infamily roles and responsibilities, to the egalitarian, where bread-winning andchild-rearing tasks are shared. Wallerstein takes no ideological position onwhich type of marriage is best, but one of the book's most fascinating insightsis that the egalitarian marriage, the model most highly prized and increasinglypursued by many younger Americans, is "frighteningly fragile." Married coupleswith demanding careers can be pulled apart by jealousy, competitiveness,loneliness, worries about children, or sheer sleep deprivation. Worse, theirtaut working lives leave little room for midcourse adjustments, let aloneunscheduled crises with a child who doesn't play by the developmental rulebook. Of all marriage types, therefore, this one requires the most constantvigilance and the most heroic effort. <p>More broadly, however, this study suggests that the challenges of marriage areessentially moral. That, I suspect, is why it is called <i>The Good Marriage</i>rather than <i>The Happy Marriage</i>. The book implicitly presentsmarriage as a school of virtue, a domain that requires tact and restraint alongwith open and honest communication, kindness and gratitude along withassertiveness and autonomy. Take the matter of fighting. Good marriages are notfree of conflict. However, the conflict is governed by a respect for thepartner's deepest vulnerabilities. No matter how fierce the anger, it stopsshort of the cruelest cut. Spouses learn what the relationship can toleratewithout breaking.<p>At the same time, marriage requires the exercise of moral imagination. Onething the couples in these good marriages have in common is a vision of themarriage as a "superordinate" entity--something that is separate from andlarger than its two parts. The men and women in this study speak of protecting"the marriage" almost as if it were their child; it is a creation they cherishand share. In another sense, too, good marriages are expressions of theimagination. These happily married people see their spouses as essentiallyadmirable and good--as morally worthy. Many express admiration for theirpartners' conscience or honesty, or praise their courage in overcoming earlierobstacles in life. (Drawing on her research on divorce, Wallerstein observesthat many people whose marriages eventually fail never had an idealized imageof their partners to begin with.)<p>Much of what I have described is never made explicit. In fact, one of the nicethings about <i>The Good Marriage</i> is its modesty. It doesn't pretend tooffer a philosophy or even a lecture on marriage. It takes no position on theideologically charged issues of women's marital roles and status. Equallyimportant, it ignores the two most common ways of talking about marriage--as acontract negotiated between two equal parties and as the pathway to individualfulfillment. For this reason it is refreshingly free of "rights" talk andtherapy talk. Indeed, Wallerstein places much more emphasis on the developmentof good judgment and a moral sense than on the acquisition of effectivecommunication or negotiation skills. <p><i>The Good Marriage </i>offers powerful evidence in support of a model forrelationships that are based not on theories of exchange or self-interest buton notions of sacrifice and altruism. "I suddenly got it about ensemble work,"an actor told Wallerstein. "Ensemble is when you work as hard for the otherguy's moment as you do for your own." <i>The Good Marriage</i> is an argumentfor an ensemble theory of marriage. </blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

<blockquote><font size=5>T</font><font size=3>HE problem of the West is nothing less than the problem of American
development. A glance at the map of the United States reveals the truth. To
write of a "Western sectionalism," bounded on the east by the Alleghanies, is,
in itself, to proclaim the writer a provincial. What is the West? What has it
been in American life? To have the answers to these questions, is to understand
the most significant features of the United States of to-day.<p>

<p>

<p>

The West, at bottom, is a form of society rather than an area. It is the term
applied to the region whose social conditions result from the application of
older institutions and ideas to the transforming influences of free land. By
this application, a new environment is suddenly entered, freedom of opportunity
is opened, the cake of custom is broken, and new activities, new lines of
growth, new institutions and new ideals, are brought into existence. The
wilderness disappears, the "West" proper passes on to a new frontier, and, in
the former area, a new society has emerged from this contact with the
backwoods. Gradually this society loses its primitive conditions, and
assimilates itself to the type of the older social conditions of the East; but
it bears within it enduring and distinguishing survivals of its frontier
experience. Decade after decade, West after West, this rebirth of American
society has gone on, has left its traces behind it, and has reacted on the
East. The history of our political institutions, our democracy, is not a
history of imitation, of simple borrowing; it is a history of the evolution and
adaptation of organs in response to changed environment, a history of the
origin of new political species. In this sense, therefore, the West has been a
constructive force of the highest significance in our life. To use the words of
that acute and widely informed observer, Mr. Bryce, "the West is the most
American part of America....What Europe is to Asia, what England is to the rest
of Europe, what America is to England, that the Western States and Territories
are to the Atlantic States."<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

The West, as a phase of social organization, began with the Atlantic coast, and
passed across the continent. But the colonial tide-water area was in close
touch with the Old World, and soon lost its Western aspects. In the middle of
the eighteenth century, the newer social conditions appeared along the upper
waters of the tributaries of the Atlantic. Here it was that the West took on
its distinguishing features, and transmitted frontier traits and ideals to this
area in later days. On the coast were the fishermen and skippers, the merchants
and planters, with eyes turned toward Europe. Beyond the falls of the rivers
were the pioneer farmers, largely of non-English stock, Scotch-Irish and
German. They constituted a distinct people, and may be regarded as an expansion
of the social and economic life of the middle region into the back country of
the South. These frontiersmen were the ancestors of Boone, Andrew Jackson,
Calhoun, Clay, and Lincoln. Washington and Jefferson were profoundly affected
by these frontier conditions. The forest clearings have been the seed plots of
American character.<p>

<p>

<p>

In the Revolutionary days, the settlers crossed the Alleghanies and put a
barrier between them and the coast. They became, to use their phrases, "the men
of the Western waters," the heirs of the "Western world." In this era, the
backwoodsmen, all along the western slopes of the mountains, with a keen sense
of the difference between them and the dwellers on the coast, demanded
organization into independent States of the Union. Self-government was their
ideal. Said one of their rude, but energetic petitions for statehood: "Some of
our fellow-citizens may think we are not able to conduct our affairs and
consult our interest; but if our society is rude, much wisdom is not necessary
to supply our wants, and a fool can sometimes put on his clothes better than a
wise man can do it for him." This forest philosophy is the philosophy of
American democracy. But the men of the coast were not ready to admit its
implications. They apportioned the state legislatures so that the
property-holding minority of the tide-water lands were able to outvote the more
populous back counties. A similar system was proposed by federalists in the
Constitutional Convention of 1787. Gouverneur Morris, arguing in favor of
basing representation  on property as well as numbers, declared that "he looked
forward, also, to that range of new States which would soon be formed in the
West. He thought the rule of representation ought to be so fixed, as to secure
to the Atlantic States a prevalence in the national councils." "The new
States," said he, "will know less of the public interest than these; will have
an interest in many respects different; in particular will be little scrupulous
of involving the community in wars, the burdens and operations of which would
fall chiefly on the maritime States. Provision ought, therefore, to be made to
prevent the maritime States from being hereafter outvoted by them." He added
that the Western country "would not be able to furnish men equally enlightened
to share in the administration of our common interests. The busy haunts of men,
not the remote wilderness, was the proper school of political talents. If the
Western people get power into their hands, they will ruin the Atlantic
interest. The back members are always most averse to the best measures." Add to
these utterances of Gouverneur Morris the impassioned protest of Josiah Quincy,
of Massachusetts, in the debates in the House of Representatives, on the
admission of Louisiana. Referring to the discussion over the slave votes and
the West in the Constitutional Convention, he declared, "Suppose, then, that it
had been distinctly foreseen that, in addition to the effect of this weight,
the whole population of a world beyond the Mississippi was to be brought into
this and the other branch of the legislature, to form our laws, control our
rights, and decide our destiny. Sir, can it be pretended that the patriots of
that day would for one moment have listened to it?...They had not taken degrees
at the hospital of idiocy....Why, sir, I have already heard of six States, and
some say there will be, at no great distance of time, more. I have also heard
that the mouth of the Ohio will be far to the east of the centre of the
contemplated empire....You have no authority to throw the rights and property
of this people into the 'hotch-pot' with the wild men on the Missouri, nor with
the mixed, though more respectable, race of Anglo-Hispano-Gallo-Americans who
bask on the sands in the mouth of the Mississippi....Do you suppose the people
of the Northern and Atlantic States will, or ought to, look on with patience
and see Representatives and Senators from the Red River and Missouri, pouring
themselves upon this and the other floor, managing the concerns of a seaboard
fifteen hundred miles, at least, from their residence; and having a
preponderancy in councils into which, constitutionally, they could never have
been admitted?"<p>

<p>

<p>

Like an echo from the fears expressed by the East at the close of the
eighteenth century  come the words of an eminent Eastern man of letters at the
end of the nineteenth century, in warning against the West; "Materialized in
their temper; with few ideals of an ennobling sort; little instructed in the
lessons of history; safe from exposure to the direct calamities and physical
horrors of war; with undeveloped imaginations and sympathies--they form a
community unfortunate and dangerous from the possession of power without a due
sense of its corresponding responsibilities; a community in which the passion
for war may easily be excited as the fancied means by which its greatness may
be convincingly exhibited, and its ambitions gratified....Some chance spark may
fire the prairie."<p>

<p>

<p>

Here then, is the problem of the West, as it looked to New England leaders of
thought in the beginning and at the end of this century. From the first, it was
recognized that a new type was growing up beyond the mountains, and that the
time would come when the destiny of the nation would be in Western hands. The
divergence of these societies became clear in the struggle over the
ratification of the federal constitution. The interior agricultural region, the
communities that were in debt and desired paper money, opposed the instrument;
but the areas of intercourse and property carried the day.<p>

<p>

<p>

It is important to understand, therefore, what were some of the ideals of this
early Western democracy. How did the frontiersman differ from the man of the
coast?<p>

<p>

<p>

The most obvious fact regarding the man of the Western waters is that he had
placed himself under influences destructive to many of the gains of
civilization. Remote from the opportunity for systematic education,
substituting a log hut in the forest clearing for the social comforts of the
town, he suffered hard-ships and privations, and reverted in many ways to
primitive conditions of life. Engaged in a struggle to subdue the forest,
working as an individual, and with little specie or capital, his interests were
with the debtor class. At each stage of its advance, the West has favored an
expansion of the currency. The pioneer had boundless confidence in the future
of his own community, and when seasons of financial contraction and depression
occurred, he, who had staked his all on confidence in Western development, and
had fought the savage for his home, was inclined to reproach the conservative
sections and classes. To explain this antagonism requires more than
denunciation of dishonesty, ignorance, and boorishness as fundamental Western
traits. Legislation in the United States has had to deal with two distinct
social conditions. In some portions of the country there was, and is, an
aggregation of property, and vested rights are in the foreground. That in the
conflict between these two ideals an even hand has always been held by the
government would be difficult to show.<p>

<p>

<p>

The separation of the Western man from the seaboard, and his environment, made
him in a large degree free from European precedents and forces. He looked at
things independently and with small regard or appreciation for the best Old
World experience. He had no ideal of a philosophical, eclectic nation, that
should advance civilization by "intercourse with foreigners and familiarity
with their point of view, and readiness to adopt whatever is best and most
suitable in their ideas, manners, and customs." His was rather the ideal of
conserving and developing what was original and valuable in this new country.
The entrance of old society upon free lands meant to him opportunity for a new
type of democracy and new popular ideals. The West was not conservative:
buoyant self-confidence and self-assertion were distinguishing traits in its
composition. It saw in its growth nothing less than a new order of society and
state. In this conception were elements of evil and elements of good.<p>

<p>

<p>

But the fundamental fact in regard to this new society was its relation to
land. Professor Boutmy has said of the United States. "Their one primary and
predominant object is to cultivate and settle these prairies, forests, and vast
waste lands. The striking and peculiar characteristic of American society is
that it is not so much a democracy as a huge commercial company for the
discovery, cultivation, and capitalization of its enormous territory. The
United States are primarily a commercial society, and only secondarily a
nation." Of course, this involves a serious misapprehension. By the very fact
of the task here set forth, far-reaching ideals of the state and of society
have been evolved in the West, accompanied by loyalty to the nation
representative of these ideals. But M. Boutmy's description hits the
substantial fact, that the fundamental traits of the man of the interior were
due to the free lands of the West. These turned his attention to the great task
of subduing them to the purposes of civilization, and to the task of advancing
his economic and social status in the new democracy which he was helping to
create. Art, literature, refinement, scientific administration, all had to give
way to this Titanic labor. Energy, incessant activity, became the lot of this
new American. Says a traveler of the time of Andrew Jackson, "America is like a
vast workshop, over the door of which is printed in blazing characters, 'No
admittance here, except on business.'" The West of our own day reminds Mr.
Bryce "of the crowd which Vathek found in the hall of Eblis, each darting
hither and thither with swift steps and unquiet mien, driven to and fro by a
fire in the heart. Time seems too short for what they have to do, and the
result always to come short of their desire."<p>

<p>

<p>

But free lands and the consciousness of working out their social destiny did
more than turn the Westerner to material interests and devote  him to a
restless existence. They promoted equality among the Western settlers, and
reacted as a check on the aristocratic influences of the East.   Where
everybody could have a farm, almost for taking it, economic  equality easily
resulted, and this involved political equality. Not without a struggle would
the Western man abandon this ideal, and it goes far to explain the unrest in
the remote West to-day.<p>

<p>

<p>

Western democracy included individual liberty, as well as equality. The
frontiersman was impatient of restraints. He knew how to preserve order, even
in the absence of legal authority. If there were cattle thieves, lynch law was
sudden and effective: the regulators of the Carolinas were the predecessors of
the claims associations of Iowa and the vigilance committees of California. But
the individual was not ready to submit to complex regulations. Population was
sparse, there was no multitude of jostling interests, as in older settlements,
demanding an elaborate system of personal restraints. Society became atomic.
There was a reproduction of the primitive idea of the personality of the law, a
crime was more an offense against the victim than a violation of the law of the
land. Substantial justice, secured in the most direct way, was the ideal of the
backwoodsman. He had little patience with finely drawn distinctions or scruples
of method. If the thing was one proper to be done, then the most immediate,
rough and ready, effective way was the best way.<p>

<p>

<p>

It followed from the lack of organized political life, from the atomic
conditions of the backwoods society, that the individual was exalted and given
free  play. The West was another name for opportunity. Here were mines to be
seized, fertile valleys to be preempted, all the natural resources open to the
shrewdest and the boldest. The United States is unique in the extent to which
the individual has been given an open field, unchecked by restraints of an old
social order, or of scientific administration of government. The self-made man
was the Western man's ideal, was the kind of man that all men might become. Out
of his wilderness experience, out of the freedom of his opportunities, he
fashioned a formula for social regeneration,--the freedom of the individual to
seek his own. He did not consider that his conditions were exceptional and
temporary.<p>

<p>

<p>

Under such conditions, leadership easily develops,--a leadership based on the
possession of the qualities most serviceable to the young society. In the
history of Western settlement, we see each forted village following its local
hero. Clay, Jackson, Harrison, Lincoln, were illustrations of this tendency in
periods when the Western hero rose to the dignity of national hero.<p>

<p>

The Western man believed in the manifest destiny of his country. On his border,
and checking his advance, were the Indian, the Spaniard, and the Englishman. He
was indignant at Eastern indifference and lack of sympathy with his view of his
relations to these peoples; at the short-sightedness of Eastern policy. The
closure of the Mississippi by Spain, and the proposal to exchange our claim of
freedom of navigating the river, in return for commercial advantages to New
England, nearly led to the withdrawal of the West from the Union. It was the
Western demands that brought about the purchase of Louisiana, and turned the
scale in favor of declaring the War of 1812. Militant qualities were favored by
the annual expansion of the settled area in the face of hostile Indians and the
stubborn wilderness. The West caught the vision of the nation's continental
destiny. Henry Adams, in his History of the United States, makes the American
of 1800 exclaim to the foreign visitor, "Look at my wealth! See these solid
mountains of salt and iron, of lead, copper, silver, and gold.  See these
magnificent cities scattered  broadcast to the Pacific! See my cornfields
rustling and waving in the summer breeze from ocean to ocean, so far that the
sun itself is not high enough to mark where the distant  mountains bound my
golden seas. Look at this continent of mine, fairest of created worlds, as she
lies turning up to the sun's never failing caress her broad and exuberant
breasts, overflowing with milk  for her hundred million children." And the
foreigner saw only dreary deserts, tenanted by sparse, ague-stricken pioneers
and savages. The cities were log huts and gambling dens. But the frontiersman's
dream was prophetic. In spite of his rude, gross nature, this early Western man
was an idealist withal. He dreamed dreams and beheld visions. He had faith in
man, hope for democracy, belief in America's destiny, unbounded confidence in
his ability to make his dreams come true. Said Harriet Martineau in 1834, "I
regard the American people as a great embryo poet, now moody, now wild, but
bringing out results of absolute good sense: restless and wayward in action,
but with deep peace at his heart; exulting that he has caught the true aspect
of things past, and the depth of futurity which lies before him, wherein to
create something so magnificent as the world has scarcely  begun to dream of.
There is the strongest hope of a nation that is capable of being possessed with
an idea."<p>

<p>

<p>

It is important to bear this idealism of the West in mind. The very materialism
that has been urged against the West was accompanied by ideals of equality, of
the exaltation of the common man, of national expansion, that make it a
profound mistake to write of the West as though it were engrossed in mere
material ends. It has been, and is, preeminently a region of ideals, mistaken
or not.<p>

<p>

<p>

It is obvious that these economic and social conditions were so fundamental in
Western life that they might well dominate whatever  accessions came to the
West by immigration from the coast sections or from Europe. Nevertheless, the
West cannot be understood without bearing in mind the fact that it has received
the great streams from the North and from the South, and that the Mississippi
compelled these currents to intermingle. Here it was that sectionalism first
gave way under the pressure of unification. Ultimately the conflicting ideas
and institutions of the old sections  struggled for dominance in this area
under the influence of the forces that made for uniformity, but this is merely
another phase of the truth that the West must become unified, that it could not
rest in sectional groupings. For precisely this reason the struggle occurred.
In the period from the Revolution to the close of the War of 1812, the
democracy of the Southern and Middle States contributed the main streams of
settlement and social influence to the West. Even in Ohio political power was
soon lost by the New England leaders. The democratic spirit of the Middle
region left an indelible impress on the West in this its formative period.
After the War of 1812, New England, its supremacy in the carrying trade of the
world having vanished, became a beehive from which swarms of settlers went out
to western New York and the remoter regions. These settlers spread New England
ideals of education and character and political institutions, and acted as a
leaven of great significance in the Northwest. But it would be a mistake to
believe than an unmixed New England influence took possession of the Northwest.
These pioneers did not come from the class that conserved the type of New
England civilization pure and undefiled. They represented a less contented,
less conservative influence. Moreover, by their sojourn in the Middle region,
on their westward march, they underwent modification, and when the farther West
received them, they suffered a forest-change, indeed. The Westernized New
England man was no longer the representative of the section that he left. He
was less conservative, less provincial, more adaptable, and approachable, less
rigorous in his Puritan ideals, less a man of culture, more a man of action.<p>

<p>

<p>

As might have been expected, therefore, the Western men, in the era of good
feeling, had much homogeneity throughout the Mississippi valley, and began to
stand as a new national type. Under the lead of Henry Clay they invoked the
national government to break down the mountain barrier by internal
improvements, and thus to give their crops an outlet to the coast. Under him
they appealed to the national government for a protective tariff to create a
home market. A group of frontier States entered the Union with democratic
provisions respecting the suffrage, and with devotion to the nation that had
given them their lands, built their roads and canals, regulated their
territorial life, and made them equals in the sisterhood of States. At last
these  Western forces of aggressive nationalism and democracy took possession
of the government in the person of the man who best embodied them, Andrew
Jackson. This new democracy that captured the country and destroyed the older
ideals of statesmanship came from no theorist's dreams of the German  forest.
It came, stark and strong and full of life, from the American forest. But the
triumph of this Western democracy  revealed also the fact that it could rally
to its aid the laboring classes of the coast, then just beginning to acquire
self-consciousness and organization.<p>

<p>

<p>

The next phase of Western development  revealed forces of division between the
northern and southern portions of the West. With the spread of the cotton
culture went the slave system and the great plantation. The small farmer in his
log cabin, raising varied crops, was displaced by the planter raising cotton.
In all except the mountainous areas, the industrial organization of the
tidewater took possession of the Southwest, the unity of the back country was
broken, and the solid South was formed. In the Northwest this was the era of
railroads and canals, opening the region to the increasing stream of Middle
State and New England settlement, and strengthening the opposition to slavery.
A map showing the location of the men of New England ancestry in the Northwest
would represent also the counties in which the Free Soil party cast its
heaviest votes. The commercial connections of the Northwest likewise were
reversed by the railroad. The result is stated by a writer in De Bow's Review
in 1852 in these words:--<p>

<p>

<p>

"What is New Orleans now? Where are her dreams of greatness and glory?...Whilst
she slept, an enemy has sowed tares in her most prolific fields. Armed with
energy, enterprise, and an indomitable spirit, that enemy, by a system of bold,
vigorous, and sustained efforts, has succeeded in reversing the very laws of
nature and of nature's God,--rolled back the mighty tide of the Mississippi and
its thousand tributary streams, until their mouth, practically and
commercially, is more at New York or Boston than at New Orleans."<p>

<p>

<p>

The West broke asunder, and the great struggle over the social system to be
given to the lands beyond the Mississippi followed. In the Civil War the
Northwest furnished the national hero,--Lincoln was the very flower of frontier
training and ideals,--and it also took into its hands the whole power of the
government. Before the war closed, the West could claim the President,
Vice-President, Chief Justice, Speaker of the House, Secretary of the Treasury,
Postmaster-General, Attorney-General, General of the army, and Admiral of the
navy.  The leading general of the war had been furnished by the West. It was
the region of action, and in the crisis it took the reins.<p>

<p>

<p>

The triumph of the nation was followed by a new era of Western development. The
national forces projected themselves across the prairies and plains. Railroads,
fostered by government loans and land grants, opened the way for settlement and
poured a flood of European immigrants and restless pioneers from all sections
of the Union into the government lands. The army of the United States pushed
back the Indian, rectangular Territories were carved into checker-board States,
creations of the federal government, without a history, without physiographical
unity, without particularistic ideas. The later frontiersman leaned on the
strong arm of national power.<p>

<p>

<p>

At the same time the South underwent a revolution. The plantation, based on
slavery, gave place to the farm, the gentry to the democratic elements. As in
the West, new industries, of mining and of manufacture, sprang up as by magic.
The New South, like the New West, was an area of construction, a debtor area,
an area of unrest; and it, too, had learned the uses to which federal
legislation might be put.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

In the mean time the old Northwest has passed through an economic and social
transformation. The whole West has furnished an area over which successive
waves of economic development have passed. The Indian hunters and traders were
followed by the pioneer farmers, engaged in raising unrotated crops; after this
came the wave of more settled town life and varied agriculture; the wave of
manufacture followed. These stages of development have passed in succession
across large parts of the old Northwest. The State of Wisconsin, now much like
parts of the State of New York, was at an earlier period like the State of
Nebraska of to-day; the granger movement and the greenback party had for a time
the ascendancy; and in the northern counties of the State, where there is a
sparser population, and the country is being settled, its sympathies are still
with the debtor class. Thus the old Northwest is  a region where the older
frontier conditions survive in parts, and where the inherited ways of looking
at things are largely to be traced to its frontier days. At the same time it is
a region in many ways assimilated to the East. It  understands both sections.
It is not entirely content with the existing structure of economic society in
the sections where wealth has accumulated and corporate organizations are
powerful; but neither has it seemed to feel that its interests lie in
supporting the programme of the prairies and the South. In the Fifty-third
Congress it voted for the income tax, but it rejected free coinage. It is still
affected by the ideal of the self-made man, rather than by the ideal of
industrial nationalism.  It is more American, but less cosmopolitan  than the
seaboard.<p>

<p>

<p>

We are now in a position to see clearly some of the factors involved in the
Western problem. For nearly three centuries the dominant fact in American life
has been expansion. With the settlement of the Pacific coast and the occupation
of the free lands, this movement has come to a check. That these energies of
expansion will no longer operate would be a rash prediction; and the demands
for a vigorous foreign policy, for an interoceanic canal, for a revival of our
power upon the seas, and for the extension of American influence to outlying
islands and adjoining countries, are indications that the movement will
continue. The stronghold of these demands lies west of the Alleghanies.<p>

<p>

<p>

In the remoter West, the restless, rushing wave of settlement has broken with a
shock against the arid plains. The free lands are gone, the continent is
crossed, and all this push and energy is turning into channels of agitation.
Failures in one area can no longer be made good by taking up land on a new
frontier; the conditions of a settled society are being reached with suddenness
and with confusion. The West has been built up with borrowed capital, and the
question of the stability of gold, as a standard of deferred payments, is
eagerly agitated by the debtor West, profoundly dissatisfied with the
industrial conditions that confront it, and actuated by frontier directness and
rigor in its remedies. For the most part, the men who built up the West beyond
the Mississippi, and who are now leading the agitation, came as pioneers from
the old Northwest, in the days when it was just passing from the stage of a
frontier section. For example, Senator Allen of Nebraska, president of the
recent national Populist Convention, and a type of the political leaders of his
section, was born in Ohio in the middle of the century; went in his youth to
Iowa, and not long after the Civil War made his home in Nebraska. As a boy, he
saw the buffalo driven out by the settlers; he saw the Indian retreat as the
pioneer advanced. His training is that of the old West, in its frontier days.
And now the frontier opportunities are gone. Discontent is demanding an
extension of governmental activity in its behalf. In these demands, it finds
itself in touch with the depressed agricultural classes and the workingmen of
the South and East. The Western problem is no longer a sectional problem; it is
a social problem on a national scale. The greater West, extending from the
Alleghanies to the Pacific, cannot be regarded as a unit; it requires analysis
into regions and classes. But its area, its population, and its material
resources would give force to its assertion that if there is a sectionalism in
the country, the sectionalism is Eastern. The old West, united to the new
South, would produce, not a new sectionalism, but a new Americanism. It would
not mean sectional disunion, as some have speculated, but it might mean a
drastic assertion of national government and imperial expansion under a popular
hero.<p>

<p>

<p>

This, then, is the real situation: a people composed of heterogeneous
materials, with diverse and conflicting ideals and social interest, having
passed from the task of filling up the vacant spaces of the continent, is now
thrown back upon itself, and is seeking an equilibrium. The diverse elements
are being fused into national unity. The forces of reorganization are turbulent
and the nation seems like a witches' kettle:<p>

<p>

<p><blockquote>

"Double, double, toil and trouble,<br>

Fire burn and cauldron bubble."<p></blockquote>

<p>

<p>

But the far West has its centres of industrial life and culture not unlike
those of the East. It has state universities, rivaling in conservative and
scientific economic instruction those of any other part of the Union, and its
citizens more often visit the East, than do Eastern men the West. As time goes
on, its industrial development will bring it more into harmony with the East.<p>

<p>

<p>

Moreover, the old Northwest holds the balance of power, and is the battlefield
on which these issues of American development are to be settled. It has more in
common with all regions of the country than has any other region. It
understands the East, as the East does not understand the West. The White City
which recently rose on the shores of Lake Michigan fitly typified its growing
culture as well as its capacity for great achievement. Its complex and
representative industrial organization and business ties, its determination to
hold fast to what is original and good in its Western experience, and its
readiness to learn and receive the results of the experience of other sections
and nations, make it an open-minded and safe arbiter of the American destiny.
In the long run the centre of the Republic may be trusted to strike a wise
balance between the contending ideals. But she does not deceive herself; she
knows that the problem of the West means nothing less than the problem of
working out the original social ideals and social adjustment for the American
nation.<p></blockquote>

Even more unsettling is the new custom of referring to human beingsas chairs.

What's the story?</em><p><strong>Sue Girkins</strong><br><em>Toledo, Ohio</em><p><br><br><br><em>I find a deep and disturbing clash between the grammar my demanding Englishteachers taught me and the current, almost universal, use of they as a pronounfor the singular word person and its synonyms.

I sometimes wonder whether the true purpose of all such issues isn't tosort readers by mental age. I've noticed three groups. The mentally elderlyread something like "A freshman might decide that someday he wants to be thechairman of a big corporation" and assume that the person in question must bemale--not so much because of the wording as because society used to be thatway. Those of us who are a bit younger mentally can read that sentence withoutfeeling that it excludes women. We learned in school that one of the meaningsof man is "humankind": a freshman or a chairman can be a member of either sex.We also learned that there is such a thing as the "generic he"--a he thatrefers to any person, in a context where no particular person is present as anantecedent for the pronoun. People of my mental age group therefore wonder whatall the fuss is about. Those who are still younger mentally make the fuss. Whenthey read the freshman sentence, they, like the mentally elderly, suppose thatit applies only to men--but they are enraged by the sexism they perceive.Unfortunately, their solutions to the problem, such as "A <i>first-year student</i>. . . s/he" or ". . . they," tend to annoy us fogeys. The former lacksgrace; the latter is more grievous, for it compromises such logic as Englishsyntax has.<p>A speaker or writer who is trying simply to express an idea, rather than topick a fight with listeners or readers, needs to tread carefully. Changingfreshman to first-year student is probably treading too far: women have beenfreshmen in great numbers for decades, and so the word carries no particularconnotation of male privilege, or of masculinity at all. Freshperson isobviously impossible--but chairperson seems harmless enough. So does "Achairman [or chairperson] . . . he or she" or, when the need to keep using bothpronouns results in something overelaborate, "Chairmen . . . they." Anotherpossibility is to try to leave the contentious words out: "A freshman mighthope to lead a big corporation someday."<p><p><br><br><br><em>I object to women writers. No, not to the authors themselves but to callingthem that. Expressions such as woman golfer and woman politician are all toocommon in modern idiomatic English. The corresponding usage to describe a manin a stereotypically female role is always the adjective male: for instance,male nurse. This will surely be a better world when we no longer need toqualify nouns with gender. Until then we could improve the world slightly byusing adjectives where adjectives are needed (female author, female golfer) andletting nouns refer to people, places, and things.</em><p><strong>Barry Hamill</strong><br><em>Minneapolis, Minn.</em><p><br><br><br>I'm sure most of us feel that this is already a better world, now that womenand men have more choices about their roles in it. Having some choice aboutwhat to call ourselves is also nice. English generally does offer its usersmore than one way to say something--more than one correct way, for a choicethat boils down to a matter of taste. Few find the likes of lady writer or ofauthoress tasteful these days, so woman writer is pretty much the only extantalternative to female writer--assuming that the context is not one like "JaneAusten was a writer," in which no purpose is served by specifying sex. <p>While it's true that the noun man is rarely used as an adjective, or"attributively," many other nouns are: think of bull rider, king crab, spermbank. In fact, woman appears in dictionaries either as an adjective in additionto a noun or with the notation that the noun is often used attributively. Atleast, that's what is in the dictionaries belonging to this woman writer.<p><br><br><br><em>Have you recently had a dispute about language which you would like this columnto resolve?

Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich . . .describes `the <i>anxious class</i>' as `consisting of millions of Americanswho no longer can count on having their jobs next year, or next month, andwhose wages have stagnated or lost ground to inflation'" (<i>New YorkTimes</i>).<p>Background: Today's managers, support staff, technicians, and line workers allexperience much the same job-related angst. But unlike, for example, Marx's<i>working class</i>, the <i>anxious class</i> has no identifiable rhetoric orvocabulary, and no designated enemy. "Instead," as the article cited abovepoints out, "business is seen as also a victim, caught in a global competitionthat forces cost-cutting and layoffs." <i>Anxious class</i> is one more item inthe growing lexicon of an uncertain business climate; another example, recentlyexplored in this space, is <i>constant whitewater</i>, which refers to therelentless turmoil faced by corporate managers.<p><B>Astroturf</B> <i>trademark</i>, used figuratively to denote advocacy advertising,chiefly on local television, that has been created to resemble a grassrootsmovement and is intended to influence lawmakers indirectly by changing publicopinion: "At a time when there is growing distrust of anything emanating fromofficial Washington, <i>Astroturf</i> campaigns have the advantage of offeringat least a semblance of populism" (<i>New York Times</i>). <p>Background: Such "synthetic" grassroots campaigns, engineered byspecial-interest groups, are modeled on last year's "Harry and Louise"television-ad series, sponsored by the insurance industry, in which a worriedcouple pored over the Clinton health-care initiative; the series is widelycredited with helping to derail public support for the plan. <i>Astroturf</i>ads usually depict just-folks characters. For example, in one, sponsored by atobacco company and an insurance company with a clear stake in tort-law reform,an affable senior citizen proclaimed, "Fewer people nowadays are willing toaccept responsibility for their own doin's. . . . I tell you, the system is outof whack." Experts are unsure of the efficacy of <i>Astroturf</i> campaigns,but they caution that many more are sure to come.<p><B>fat skis</B> <i>plural noun</i>, <i>slang</i>, double-wide downhill snow skis. Alsocalled<i> fat boards</i>; <i>fatties</i>; <i>training wheels</i>. "Thanks tothe invention of <i>fat skis</i>, thousands of ordinary skiers are discoveringthe joy of skiing on powder snow. . . . Because they require far less effort tomaneuver in powder and other challenging snow conditions, <i>fat skis</i> canadd years to a skier's career" (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>).<p>Background: <i>Fat skis</i> were developed by the Austrian ski designer RupertHuber, who cut a snowboard down the middle and mounted downhill bindings oneach half. Huber had noticed that snowboarders are able to float on powder,rather than "submarining" beneath the surface like inexperienced skiers onconventional skis. <i>Fat skis</i>, now in a more sophisticated design, arebeing used by some ski schools to train beginners; however, they are scorned bymost longtime powder skiers, who consider it cheating to use them. <p><B>high-rise cat syndrome</B> <i>noun</i>, the complex of injuries, ranging frompulmonary contusions to limb and dental fractures, sustained by a cat that hasfallen from a substantial height: "Indeed, for pets as for humans, summer inthe city can be brutal. For this is the season of <i>high-rise catsyndrome</i>, when pets plunge inexplicably from 20th-story windows" (<i>NewYork Times</i>).<p>Background: More generally called <i>high-rise syndrome</i>, since it also hasinvolved dogs, ferrets, a turtle, and even an iguana, this condition goes backin the veterinary-medicine literature to at least 1976, when it was called<i>high-rise trauma syndrome</i>. According to one veterinarian who has treatedhundreds of survivors, the syndrome occurs chiefly in New York, where thenumerous, often un-air-conditioned high-rise buildings frequently lack windowscreens, because the population of flying insects is paltry. Surprisingly, thefarther the fall after a certain point, the lower the mortality rate and thefewer the serious injuries: cats reach their maximum velocity after fallingabout five stories, and begin thereafter to relax into a horizontal positionthat slows their fall and distributes the impact. Last summer one cat survivedafter falling 46 stories, which is believed to be a record.</blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

<blockquote>

	

	<font size=5>T</font>HE planned expansion of the <A HREF="http://www.nato.int/">North Atlantic Treaty 

	Organization</A> into Eastern

Europe has been compared by one sour critic to the behavior of a couple in a

crumbling marriage, who instead of going to a marriage counselor decide to try

to save their relationship by having a baby, or possibly even several babies.

<A HREF="http://www.saclant.nato.int/nato.html">NATO</A> itself is in the middle of a very confused debate about its identity and

role, and partly as a result it is difficult to detect any honest, coherent

discussion in the West of the necessity for expansion and of how it will affect

relations with Russia, the security of Ukraine and the Baltic States, and the

peaceful integration of Ukraine into Europe. A potential diplomatic debacle is

in the making. Fortunately, more and more voices are being raised in the United

States against this policy.<p>



<A HREF="relarnat.htm"><img src="../../../images/shorsera.gif" align=left vspace=10 hspace=10 border=0 alt="(Related Articles)">

	

	</A>

The official Western line at present is that NATO expansion is meant to

"strengthen European security," but not against Russia or against feared

Russian aggression. Nevertheless, a Russian official recently remarked to me on

this score, "You must think we're blind and deaf." All public discussion in

Poland, and much of it in the United States, on the part of Zbigniew

Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger, Robert Dole, and others, has been conducted in

terms of the need to contain a presumed Russian threat and to prevent Russia

from exerting influence on its neighbors--influence that is automatically

viewed as illegitimate and threatening to the West.<p>



Western protests that NATO has completely changed its nature since 1990 are met

with Russian requests to be told exactly what, then, NATO is today--a question

to which NATO itself simply does not know the answer. Western diplomats are

unable to say what "security" in the context of, say, Poland actually

means--and therefore unable to give any intelligible response when asked how it

can be strengthened by NATO expansion.<p>



The attitude of Boris Yeltsin's government and the entire Russian political

establishment to the expansion issue (after some wavering, above all on the

part of <A HREF="gopher://gopher.nato.int:70/00/partners/rus2206.94">Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev</A>) is now strongly and

unanimously negative, though the government hopes for the moment to continue

exerting influence against expansion by cooperating with NATO--hence its

agreement to join the <A HREF="gopher://gopher.nato.int:70/11/partners">Partnership for Peace</A>.<p>



The reasons for Russian opposition are twofold: In the first place, NATO

expansion is seen as a betrayal of clear though implicit promises made by the

West in 1990-1991, and a sign that the West regards Russia not as an ally but

as a defeated enemy. Russians point out that Moscow agreed to withdraw troops

from the former East Germany following unification after NATO promised not to

station its troops there. Now NATO is planning to leapfrog over eastern Germany

and end up 500 miles closer to Russia, in Poland. Western arguments that the

1990 promise to Mikhail Gorbachev referred only to East Germany, not to the

rest of Eastern Europe, though strictly speaking correct, are not unnaturally

viewed by Russians as purely jesuitical. Yeltsin's officials say that NATO

expansion would lead to a reversal of the previous pro-



Western

policy of the Yeltsin and Gorbachev governments, with serious domestic

political consequences in the form of revanchist nationalism.<p>



In the second place, Russians fear that NATO expansion will ultimately mean the

inclusion of the Baltic States and Ukraine within NATO's sphere of influence,

if not in NATO itself--and thus the loss of any Russian influence over these

states and the stationing of NATO troops within striking distance of the

Russian heartland. Most Western diplomats privately say that these fears are

paranoid, but the West's inability publicly to rule out the possible future

inclusion of any country in NATO makes it very difficult to reassure the

Russians.<p>



The overwhelming majority of Russian politicians, including most liberals, now believe it is necessary that most of the former Soviet Union

(excluding the Baltic States) be within a Russian sphere of influence. They see

this not as imperialism but as a justifiable defense of Russian interests

against a multiplicity of potential threats (radical Islam, future Turkish

expansionism), of Russian populations outside Russia, and of areas in which

Russia has long maintained a cultural presence--Ukraine, for example. This does

not necessarily involve demands for hegemony over Russia's neighbors, but it

certainly implies the exclusion of any other bloc's or superpower's military

presence. In justification Russians point to the <A HREF="http://futures.wharton.upenn.edu/~heyman21/documents/monroe-d.html">Monroe Doctrine</A> and to the

French sphere of influence in Africa. Most educated Russians now view Western

criticism as mere hypocrisy masking Western aggrandizement. They point with

anger to America's arming of Turkey in recent years, and to what are seen as

recent attempts to expand U.S. influence in the former Soviet republics of

Central Asia, where arguments about strengthening local democracy or Western

security can hardly apply.<p>



For example, <A HREF="http://www.nd.edu/~astrouni/zhiwriter/spool/17.htm">General Alexander Lebed</A>, widely favored to win free elections for

the presidency if these are held on schedule, in June of 1996, has publicly

opposed the Russian military interventions in Tajikistan and Chechnya. He has

also, however, spoken with extreme bitterness about NATO's expansion, even

warning that this could lead to a third world war. Lebed told Reuters that NATO

is behaving like "a big drunken hooligan in a kindergarten who says he will hit

anyone he likes," and has said that NATO expansion into Eastern Europe would

force Russia to form a new military bloc of its own and cancel treaties and

military agreements with the West. He has also said, "The Cold War is over.

They won, and we all agreed to this. So why have you decided to re-open the

competition?"<p>



                             <center> *    *    *</center><p>



Threatened Russian responses to NATO expansion range from an end to cooperation

with the West should Poland become a member to bloodcurdling off-the-record

hints of destabilization and military action should membership look likely for

Ukraine and the Baltic States. In the words of Vladimir Lukin, the chairman of

the Duma Foreign Relations Committee and an ally of the liberal opposition

leader Grigory Yavlinsky, "If NATO wants to expand to Eastern Europe, then

first there must be a long process of international discussion, involving

Russia, about what NATO is, and what the threats to security in the region

really are and how they can be countered. But if NATO expansion were to aim at

ultimate membership for the Baltic States and Ukraine, without Russia, that

would be utterly unacceptable. No Russian could possibly accept the presence of

a potentially hostile NATO within striking distance of Smolensk--or what were

the sacrifices of the Second World War in aid of? I won't say how we should

react to such a threat, because I am committed to friendship between Russia and

the West. But I can tell you that the United States would find it a much more

dangerous process than dropping bombs on the Bosnian Serbs."<p>



Lukin and others have suggested that if NATO really does push forward against

Russia, then Russia may have to retarget its nuclear weapons on the West,

beginning with the restationing of tactical warheads in Kaliningrad. This may

be the only practical way for Russia, given its military weakness, to put

military pressure on the West; and if Western European populations were

suddenly to find themselves once again under nuclear threat as a result of what

could be portrayed as a reckless and aggressive U.S.-





led policy, the result would probably be a first-



class

political crisis in the West, possibly destroying NATO from within. Such a

likelihood is especially great in Germany, given the increasing role of the

Greens in government there. It must be stressed, however, that Lukin and others

speak of such a move only as the very last resort.<p>



Lukin would probably define himself as a statist at heart, but radical Russian

democrats also find NATO expansion deeply distressing, for reasons both of

patriotism and of liberalism and "Westernization": excluding Russia from Europe

and pushing it back toward Asia would increase Russia's "Asiatic" character in

the spiritual as well as the geographical sense. By symbolically pushing Russia

back to the status of Muscovy, as Russia was known before the reign of Peter

the Great, NATO expansion could also deal a blow of historic importance to the

whole effort, intermittent since the time of Peter, to reform Russia in a

Western direction.<p>



One normally sober, centrist, and pragmatic Russian foreign-policy adviser told

me not long ago that in the event of a NATO move toward Ukraine, Russia would

do its best to wreck the Ukrainian economy with an energy blockade, to rouse

the Russian populations of Crimea and eastern Ukraine to revolt, and to subvert

the Ukrainian armed forces, whose officer corps is still largely composed of

ethnic Russians. Of course, this may well be hot air. Russia might not dare

pursue such a strategy, and if it did dare, it might well discover itself to be

powerless--because Ukraine today is not nearly so weak or fissiparous as it was

a couple of years ago, and because most Russians in Ukraine would themselves

probably resist such moves. All the same, it hardly seems rational for the West

to increase the risk of such a crisis without some very pressing reasons.<p>



The no longer current belief in the West that Russia would not oppose expansion

came largely from the false impression of Russia's interests that was given by

Andrei Kozyrev and the democrats in the early 1990s, an impression the West was

very foolish to take at face value. We should have looked instead at Kozyrev's

political insignificance in the Moscow establishment and at the way that any

Russian establishment was sooner or later going to define permanent Russian

national interests. Over the past eighteen months Kozyrev's tactics and

statements have been largely dominated by the requirements of his own

short-term political survival. (These tactics appear not to have worked;

<A HREF="http://www.nando.net/newsroom/ntn/world/world426_15.html">Yeltsin has been hinting that he will dismiss Kozyrev</A>.)<p>



<center> *    *    *</center><p>



NATO expansion raises two serious questions for the West, neither of which has

been regularly addressed in the Western "debate" on the issue, despite the

acres of newsprint devoted to the subject. The first: Is fear of Russian

aggression justified? The second: Will NATO membership for Poland in particular

make Russia's western neighbors, Ukraine and the Baltic States, more or less

secure?<p>



The answer to the first question is that, as every Western military

attach&eacute; in Moscow with whom I have spoken agrees, a Russian military

threat to Poland and Eastern Europe is for the foreseeable future

inconceivable. The war in <A HREF="http://www.cesi.it/flags/chechnya.html">Chechnya</A> has been squalid and brutal, but given what

it has revealed about the state of the Russian army, and about most Russians'

complete lack of desire to fight wars, it should actually allow us all to sleep

more easily in our beds. Nor, given the transformation of the Eastern European

economies and political systems, does Russia have the ability to bring serious

nonmilitary pressure to bear on these states. Russia is therefore not an

immediate threat to Eastern Europe--so why the urgency about NATO expansion?<p>



This brings us to the second question, for a potential Russian threat to

Ukraine and the Baltic States obviously does exist. But as a Western ambassador

to Moscow recently told me he had cabled to his government, "If Kiev is more

secure, then Warsaw automatically becomes more secure, but this is not true the

other way round." Thus NATO membership for Poland might radically lessen

Ukraine's security, because Moscow, in a pre-emptive anti-



NATO

measure, would greatly increase pressure on Kiev to join a Russian-



dominated

military alliance. Western diplomats in Kiev are worried by this possibility.<p>



So, too, are the Ukrainians, who fear that NATO membership for Poland would

leave their country clearly designated as non-European. Recently President

Leonid Kuchma has put a brave face on NATO expansion, now that it seems

inevitable, but the worry remains. In the words of the distinguished Ukrainian-



Canadian

historian Bohdan Krawchenko, who has been training civil servants in Kiev for

the past two years, "NATO should be very careful over expansion. Its advocates

are raising all sorts of irrelevant points, when the only serious issue to be

considered is that of the security of Ukraine and the Baltic States. NATO may

make a disastrous decision--to draw a new iron curtain on the eastern frontier

of Poland. That would be as much as to say that Europe stops at the Visegrad

countries, and the rest of you can go to hell. . . . The problem is that

Western Europe doesn't know what Europe is, and hasn't even thought seriously

about what Europe should look like in twenty years' time. The West should be

thinking about this and drawing up long-



term

strategies, not making short-term political decisions. The integration of the

East Europeans into the West has to be an evolutionary process. Let it continue

for a while before taking any new steps."<p>



If Russia had already begun to put ruthless pressure on Ukraine and the Baltic

States, then the West might be justified in going ahead with NATO expansion

regardless; but no such pressure is currently being applied. On the contrary,

Moscow has actively discouraged radical Russian separatism in the Crimea, and

it has withdrawn its troops from the Baltic States, subsequently exerting

neither military nor economic pressure on the Balts, despite deep anger at the

policies of those states toward their Russian minorities. Moscow has been tough

in its negotiations with Kiev over control of the Black Sea fleet and its base

at Sevastopol, but without resorting to military pressure. According to all the

Western military analysts I have spoken to, there has been no redeployment

whatsoever of Russian forces so as to threaten Ukraine.<p>



Russia today is both weaker and much more cautious than most people in the West

realize. There are no indications at present that the Yeltsin government or any

other rational Russian government that might come into being (excluding, that

is, the likes of Zhirinovsky and his adherents) would be willing to pay the

immense economic and diplomatic costs of trying to bring Ukraine and the Balts

to their knees. As for the Russian people, while they are certainly deeply

nostalgic for the Soviet Union and great-power status, they are also deeply

unwilling to sacrifice Russian lives and money to restore that status. This is

shown by the widespread unpopularity of the military operations in Chechnya and

Tajikistan--something that should give pause to those in the West who talk

about Russians' being "naturally imperialist." The French, for example, fought

infinitely harder in defense of their colonial empire, from the 1940s to the

1960s, than the Russians have done.<p>



Apart from Chechnya and Tajikistan, Russian military pressure on the republics

to submit to Russian hegemony, though often cynical and ruthless, has been

exercised through local intermediaries (Abkhaz, Ossetes, Armenians,

Transdniestrians), and has therefore been both veiled and limited in scope. As

for the intervention in Chechnya, the whole affair has been morally vile, but

this republic is, after all, internationally recognized as part of the <A HREF="http://www.paradise.net/~tsp/russia.html">Russian

Federation</A>, and the Russian government hesitated for more than three years

before finally invading, in the face of immense provocation from

DzhokarDudayev, the President of Chechnya. Western governments over the past

generation or so would have shown less restraint. What has happened in Chechnya

therefore does not necessarily prefigure Russian policies beyond Russia's

borders--especially since Russia has gotten such a bloody nose there.<p>



Western diplomats in Moscow generally know all this--though I detect an

alarming tendency among the more opportunistic and cowardly of them to suppress

this knowledge in the face of the prevailing wind blowing from their

chancelleries at home, and among those chancelleries simply to ignore or censor

advice from their Moscow embassies when it runs counter to the new Western

consensus.<p>



One problem is that in the West the  public discussion, insofar as it exists at

all, is taking place in an atmosphere of op-



ed

pieces highly colored by Cold War attitudes, Russophobia, ignorance of the

region, fundamental indifference to the fate of the Balts and the Ukrainians,

and a hypocritical refusal to set Russia's present experience in a general

context of European decolonization and neo-



colonialism--at

which point it becomes clear that brutal defense of an existing sphere of

influence does not necessarily make a country a threat to the rest of the

world.<p>



<center> *    *    *</center><p>



The global threat from the Soviet Union came from a mixture of that state's

implacable anti-



Western

ideology, communism's claim to universal truth and applicability, and the

immensely powerful Soviet armed forces. Russia today possesses none of these

features, and Russian nationalism, while often dangerous and disgusting, poses

no direct threat to anyone beyond the borders of the former Soviet Union. Since

Russia is thus not a security threat to Eastern Europe, and most Western

analysts know this, the real but unacknowledged motives for NATO expansion have

to be sought elsewhere. They appear to be fourfold.<p>



<li> Within the United States the reason seems to be strongly connected to

electoral politics, in the desire of both the Clinton Administration and its

Republican opponents to appeal to the Polish and other ethnic lobbies, and in

the desire of the Administration to be seen as taking a firm, tough, "dynamic"

initiative in international affairs, so as to counteract a general impression

of confusion and weakness. Among the Republicans, however, the wish for a

stronger U.S. stand against China and Russia coincides with a growing

unwillingness to supply foreign aid to regional states or to pursue nonmilitary

strategies of deterrence--an intellectually ludicrous and politically dangerous

mixture, because it risks encouraging the Ukrainians, for example, to take up

tougher positions vis-&agrave;-vis Moscow, only to find themselves abandoned by

the United States should a crisis result.<p>



<li> The Western Europeans are falling in line with this U.S. initiative above all

out of fear that America will turn isolationist and withdraw from Europe--a

fear strengthened by aspects of contemporary Republicanism and mutual

irritations over Bosnia. In the (patronizing) words of one Western European

diplomat, "We have to give the Americans some new toys to play with in NATO,

because we're afraid that otherwise they may get bored and go home."<p>



The Germans in particular have a curious mixture of attitudes: Liberal Germans

are possessed by their old fear that unless Germany is anchored in NATO, and

NATO is maintained by being expanded, German nationalists may be tempted once

again to pursue the German <i>Sonderweg</i> ("separate path"). The

nationalists, for their part, do see NATO expansion as a path to greater German

influence in Europe, and to rolling back  Russia, which they detest for having

defeated and humiliated them in 1945. Both camps want a row of NATO buffer

states between themselves and the unstable former Soviet Union, even at the

risk of making that instability much worse. In neither case is it an ethical

position.<p>



<li> An additional Western European reason for agreeing to NATO expansion is an

awareness of just how difficult it will be to expand the <A HREF="http://www.lib.duke.edu/pdmt/eu.html">European Union</A>, the

other Western organization that the Eastern Europeans are passionately eager to

join. Russia has no objections to EU expansion, because although it would

clearly expand Western influence, it would also carry the possibility of major

economic advantages for Russia. Thus the Russian government actually publicly

welcomed Finland's entry into the EU.<p>



But as far as the EU itself is concerned, full membership for the Eastern

Europeans is the subject of an immense internal debate, at a time when Europe

is nowhere near digesting or resolving the consequences of 

<A HREF="http://www.echo.lu/eudocs/en/maastricht/mt_top.html">Maastricht</A> or

agreeing on its own future nature and identity. In particular, expansion to

include Eastern Europe would mean a complete renegotiation of the Common

Agricultural Policy--an idea that makes European officials blench. From the

point of view of, say, French officials, Russian anger pales into

insignificance when compared with the fury of French farmers, who can really

make them suffer--or so they think. But clearly the West has to do something to

honor all those promises to the Eastern Europeans--so why not expand NATO?<p>



<li> Finally, there is the sheer force of bureaucratic inertia and interest

politics. NATO is an immense international military-bureaucratic organization

that also directly and indirectly feeds huge numbers of intellectuals,

journalists, and analysts. Consciously or unconsciously, all these people have

a strong interest in keeping their jobs by finding a new and continuing role

for NATO; and if they can't agree on such a role, then expansion will have to

serve as a substitute. The intellectually lazy and cowardly among them also

find it easier to recycle Cold War images of the Russian threat than to try to

make sense of a new and confusing multipolar world--in which, for example, one

really ought to know some foreign languages. <p>



All these factors together add up to immensely powerful political reasons for

NATO expansion--but reasons that are utterly feeble in terms of the real

interests both of the West and of Russia's neighbors.<p>



The risk now exists that relations with Russia are about to enter an ever-



faster

downward spiral. In the context of the Russian parliamentary elections due at

this writing to be held in December and of the presidential election scheduled

for June, anti-



Western

rhetoric is bound to increase. The same will be true, to a lesser extent, of

anti-



Russian

rhetoric in the United States in the period before the presidential elections.

Harsh Russian statements may lead to speeded-



up

NATO expansion; the Russian response will then become even harsher; and so on.

The potential consequences of this range from the serious to the disastrous.

(If the Russian presidential elections are canceled, or if Yeltsin dies before

then and there is an attempt to create some sort of dilapidated Yeltsinite

autocracy, then the implications for Russian foreign policy will not be so

clear.)<p>



For the moment Western readiness to renegotiate the Conventional Forces in

Europe Treaty so as to accommodate Russia's new post-Soviet strategic position

has helped to prevent a complete breakdown. So, too, has the fact that NATO has

made it clear that the process of accepting the new members will take several

years.



<center> *    *    *</center><p>



For the future, however, it is still the case that Russian officials and

analysts threaten a general collapse of cooperation and deliberate Russian

attempts to sabotage Western interests elsewhere in the world in the event of a

rapid NATO expansion to Eastern Europe without some considerable compensation

for Russia. For example, at present the standing orders to Russian diplomats at

the United Nations are to cooperate with the West except when this is seen as

clearly against Russia's interests. Those orders could be changed, and the UN

returned to its position of Cold War paralysis. This might not worry those

Republicans who in any case loathe the UN, but it ought to worry every

Westerner who is aware of how frequently the UN has served the West's interests

since 1990.<p>



In the new, unpredictable multipolar world, and given the potential danger from

China over the next few years, Western policy toward Russia should in my view

be devoted to keeping options open, and keeping an eye on the West's possible

future need of Russia as an ally--since Western and Russian interests still

actually coincide in several vital parts of the world. This policy should be

abandoned only if a Russian government demonstrates clearly aggressive

intentions toward its western neighbors--which is not at present the case. And

as Bohdan Krawchenko has stressed, this is no moment--just as economic reform

in Ukraine is beginning to gather speed--to be risking Ukraine's progress

toward the West, by drawing new borders that exclude it.<p>



If NATO expansion is slowed to take account of Russia's objections, and if

Russia tones down those objections so as not to strain its relations with the

West, the reason is indeed likely to be China. Both Russian and Western

policymakers are increasingly aware that it would be very foolish for either

Russia or the West to allow the issue of NATO expansion in Europe to wreck the

chances of future cooperation in the Far East at a time when China's future is

looking so uncertain, and when so many potential Chinese threats to Far Eastern

security and even territory exist. <p>



Russian policy therefore remains to try to influence NATO by cooperating with

it--hence the decision to join the Partnership for Peace. An additional reason

for this policy is that although the anger of Russian diplomats over NATO

behavior is unfeigned, more serious and less paranoid Russians do of course

realize that NATO represents no threat of direct attack on Russia. Indeed, the

Western alliance's display of weakness, cowardice, and internal divisions over

Bosnia has diminished Russian fears of NATO as an organization.<p>



There remains, therefore, a good chance that over the next few years NATO

expansion, and the Russian response to it, will be finessed so as to reduce any

damage to NATO-



Russian

relations and any threat of greater instability in the former Soviet Union.

Alternatively, that expansion will be delayed until the emergence of new global

issues makes the whole question seem unimportant to both Russia and the West.

There is also, however, a real danger that under a new, more nationalist

Russian government, and a more hard-line Republican Administration in the

United States, disputes over the issue would veer out of control, with

consequences that cannot be foreseen.

<blockquote>





	<font size=5>T</font>HERE'S a peculiar rightness to Walter Hill's making a wonderful, ruminative

movie in the mid-1990s about Wild Bill Hickok. After a beautiful tableau of

Hickok's funeral, the first twenty minutes of <i>Wild Bill </i>blow the top of

your head off; the next seventy-seven pack brains and feeling back in. That

could be a metaphor for the careers of Hill and others who came of age during

American film's creative explosion twenty years ago. Along with <a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/person-exact?+DePalma,+Brian">Brian De Palma</a>,

who broke through with <i><a href= "http://www.voyagerco.com/CC/sfh/carrie.html">Carrie </a></i>(1976), and <a href= "http://sunsite.unc.edu/usenet-i/groups-html/alt.movies.scorsese.html">Martin Scorsese</a>, with <i><a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?+Mean+Streets+(1973)">Mean

Streets</a></i> (1973) and <i><a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?Taxi%20Driver">Taxi Driver</a></i> (1976), Hill, who made his debut as a

director in 1975 with the Charles Bronson bare-knuckle-boxing movie <i><a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?+Hard+Times+(1975)">Hard

Times</a></i>, was seen as one of Hollywood's Young Turks; they were hailed by

supporters as cinematic sharpshooters and criticized by denigrators as

exploitative sadists. In a 1980 <i>Saturday Review </i>article, "The

Brutalists: Making Movies Mean and Ugly," Hill took the unkindest cuts of all.

About Hill's comment "Someday I'm going to make a really violent film--like

<i>Elektra</i>," the essayist Robert F. Moss sniffily wrote, "Nice try, but

even when violence abounds in a literary classic, it shares the stage with

great poetry, character development, insight, and a sense of

humanity--qualities that are ignored and even scorned by the brutalists." Of

course, these directors aren't brutalists--they're fabulists. In their movies

poetry is visual and kinetic, character is revealed through action, insight is

gained from outward perception, and humanity is tested in extremis.<p>

 

<i>Wild Bill</i> (scheduled to be released this month) starts out as a

ripsnorting biopic of <a href= "http://history.cc.ukans.edu/heritage/research/gunfighters.html">James Butler Hickok (1837-1876)</a>--a scout for the Union

Army in the Civil War, and then a lawman, a gambler, and a gunfighter. As soon

as Hickok hits the boomtown of <a href= "http://www.state.sd.us/state/executive/tourism/20reason/deadwood.htm">Deadwood</a>, in the Dakota Territory, the movie

turns into a memory play. Black-and-white images of Hickok's life slither

through his brain as the past comes back to haunt him in the form of his

soon-to-be assassin, Jack McCall. The film climaxes in a Beckett-like

existential farce, as McCall can't quite work himself up to kill Wild Bill and

the hero ponders whether his own life is worth saving. As Bill, Jeff Bridges

has dash and size and depth--stoic fury and heroic resignation. The robust,

voluble James Gammon, as Bill's buffalo-hunting partner, California Joe, and

the deft, courtly John Hurt, as an English gambler named Charley Prince (who

narrates), are classic sidekicks. Diane Lane, as Bill's ravaged true love,

Susannah Moore (in this telling, Jack McCall's mother), and Ellen Barkin, as a

blustery, yearning Calamity Jane (she wants Bill to love her as he loved

Susannah), are spirited rural heroines. They fill boots vacated by Hollywood

legends long ago. But the movie is no sentimental throwback. <i>Wild Bill

</i>looks at the Old West with both eyes open--and doesn't blink. <p>



Will it be seen as the leap forward it is? A lot depends on whether viewers and

critics can free themselves of received opinions. The media have never been

more mired in conventional wisdom; these days studio heads, pundits, and

editors alike tend to rally round square, crowd-pleasing productions, such as

anything starring Tom Hanks. "I never thought of myself as a serious filmmaker,

like <a href= "http://www.empirenet.com/~rdaeley/directors/kurosawa.html">Kurosawa</a> and <a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/person-exact?e14857">Bu&ntilde;uel</a>," Hill told me recently, "but shouldn't critics

be trying to create a more challenging atmosphere? Shouldn't they be asking

where is the American Bu&ntilde;uel, <a href= "http://www.empirenet.com/~rdaeley/directors/bergman.html">Bergman</a>, or <a href= "http://www.empirenet.com/~rdaeley/directors/fellini.html">Fellini</a>?" Cursory followers of

American movies would be surprised to hear Hill voice such a highfalutin

question. Scorsese transcended the brutalist rap by adapting a couple of

literary behemoths--<i><a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?+Last+Temptation+of+Christ,+The+(1988)">The Last Temptation of Christ</a></i> (1988), <i><a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?+Age+of+Innocence,+The+(1993)">The Age of

Innocence</a></i> (1993)--and acquiring an image as the high priest of the cinema.

De Palma and Hill, the most audacious genre stylists for two decades, still

labor under it. When viewed from a pristine academic vantage point, their ups

and downs haven't helped their reputations. Their careers, like those of, say,

John Ford and John Huston, are patchwork quilts of sustained accomplishment,

commercial misadventures, and ambitious artistic successes too often regarded

as botches simply because they failed at the box office--notably De Palma's

<i><a href= "http://www.it.sics.se/ot/sff.catalogue/Blowout.html">Blow Out</a></i> (1981) and <i><a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?+Casualties+of+War+(1989)">Casualties of War</a></i> (1989), and Hill's

<i><a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?+Southern+Comfort+(1981)">Southern Comfort</a></i> (1981) and <i><a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?1581F3">Geronimo: An American Legend</a></i> (1993).

<p>



The r&eacute;sum&eacute;s these directors have accrued--mixing studio and

personal projects, strategizing for clout in order to play for aesthetic keeps

later on--bring them closer to American life as it is lived than the illusory

nobility fostered at film festivals in every major American city and at the

<a href= "http://cybermart.com/sundance/institute/institute.html">Sundance Institute</a>, virtually the legislative capital of independent

filmmaking. Their best movies have a denser moral and emotional environment

than wanly virtuous or frivolous independent fare. Hill has moved faster than

his contemporaries, running in zigzag directions. In his gang movie <i><a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?+Warriors,+The+(1979)">The

Warriors</a></i>(1979) he came on like a comic-book <a href= "http://www.cat.pdx.edu/~caseyh/horror/director/langbio.html">Fritz Lang</a>, using rip-cut

editing and charged visuals to supply (not just enhance) the drama. In his

first western, the Jesse James saga <i><a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?+Long+Riders,+The+(1980)">The Long Riders</a></i> (1980), he revealed

the soul of a pastoral poet, interspersing slashing action with sweeping

romantic views of the galloping outlaws in their long tan dusters and courtship

scenes as formal and pretty as tintypes. He has kept on exploring new points of

attack in small-scale, high-impact adventures like <i><a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?+Johnny+Handsome+(1990)">Johnny Handsome</a></i>

(1989), a revenge fable done in a startling declamatory style, and <i><a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?+Trespass+(1992)">Trespass</a>

</i>(1992), a Poe-like parable of greed set in an abandoned East St. Louis

factory.<p>



If there's an overriding trend in Hill's work, it's the harnessing of

sophisticated editing and camera techniques to buttress the power of plain

utterance. <i>Wild Bill </i>begins with the hymn "Leaning on Jesus"; its simple

potency sets the keynote for a movie that for all its time-and-space-hopping is

immediately understandable and moving. In Quentin Tarantino's acclaimed <i>Pulp

Fiction</i>, three interlocking stories are told out of chronological order, so

that a major character murdered in one shows up in another. The ploy provides a

flip-book <i>frisson</i>. <i>Wild Bill</i> is infinitely more layered, with a

cascade of flashbacks constructed to be read three different ways--as facts, as

twice-told tales, as dreams. There's even a flashback within a flashback,

during a gunfight. Yet Hill's aim is steady and true; the effect is to fold

action into the complexities of a life.<p>

 

<font size=5>T</font>HE early shots of Wild Bill and California Joe picking their way through

endless prairies inspire acute nostalgia for the notion that we had "men to

match our mountains." The epigraph on <i>Wild Bill</i>'s screenplay is from

Whitman: ". . . an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos." That suggests how

much imaginative territory Hill reclaims in a hundred minutes or so.

Exhilaration mingles with melancholy; Hill comes to bury Hickok <i>and </i>to

praise him. After decades of revisionism, <i>Wild Bill </i>reminds you that for

a century and a half the American West provided the ideal landscape in which to

envision individuals developing a country and making their mark without wealth

or pedigree.<p> 



The most imposing and entertaining rendering of Hickok's saga before this,

Cecil B. DeMille's <i><a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?+Plainsman,+The+(1936)">The Plainsman</a></i>(1936), starring Gary Cooper, began

with Lincoln ordaining the cultivation of the frontier the night he was

assassinated. Hill doesn't get so grandiose, but he does weave in Wild Bill's

background as a Union scout and his reverence for Honest Abe. He manages to

harrow and preserve a Hickok myth composed of glamour, humor, and gall. The

story unfolds rapidly, limning significant characters in fleeting gestures; in

a single glimpse of Wild Bill's pitiable theatrical career, Keith Carradine

gracefully impersonates Buffalo Bill Cody. But the movie has a scale and

amplitude to suit its theme. It dramatizes how a large-spirited man like Hickok

could shape his personality by pressing against the breadth and anarchy of the

West. It also details how depleted he could be by the spiraling down of the

West into a low-rent Sodom called <a href= "http://www.state.sd.us/state/executive/tourism/grptour/cities/deadwd.htm">Deadwood</a>. Hickok moseys down a Deadwood

street at night and sees a boy who stole a horse, a Chinese man who "looked the

wrong way at a white woman," and an Indian who hit town after Custer's Last

Stand, all sitting in a giant birdcage, waiting to be hanged. <i>Wild Bill

</i>synthesizes the legendry of <i>The Long Riders </i>and the history of

<i>Geronimo: An American Legend</i>. It's a grand summation. <p>



In staccato opening bursts Hill presents events (apocryphal and real) that

built Wild Bill's name, from a mounted one-on-one with an Indian known as

Whistler to murderous one-against-many barroom brawls. The episodes are similar

only in Hickok's avidity--although he never engages in violence without

frontier justification, he's always prepared for a fight. Hill doesn't hide his

esteem for Hickok's scrappiness: it's what makes the gunfighter a prodigious

figure. Nor does he prettify the violence: it's messy and emotional. When Wild

Bill brains and then shoots a soldier who is grabbing at his leg in a room

filled with hostile troopers, the act is shocking--yet instantly comprehensible

as part of a churning chaos. Hill is peerless at defining the moment of truth

in a showdown, and the moment of regret directly afterward. You know how

impressive Bridges's performance is going to get when Wild Bill guns down a

badman and then, by mistake, his own deputy; Bridges captures his feral

anguish, and Hill frames it in a chilling slowed closeup of the turn of his

head. Wild Bill develops an ironic attitude toward his own prowess and

celebrity. In a primitive Nebraska saloon a swipe at his bearskin hat sparks a

shoot-out between the hero and a gang aiming to fleece him; after killing three

men and grievously wounding another, Hickok wryly comments, "Oughta

understand--you don't ever touch another man's hat." It becomes a signature

line. Bill creates a persona out of roughhewn dandyism and a sardonic

willingness to carry ideas to their limits. In the black-comic high point a

goaty guy in a wheelchair (Bruce Dern, in glorious dudgeon) calls Bill out, and

Bill doesn't flinch from the challenge--without giving away the joke, you could

say he sits into it. Bill is always wide awake, especially in the center of a

storm. That's why it's such a presentiment of doom when his sight starts to

fade.<p>

 

<font size=5>D</font>RAWN mostly from Thomas Babe's play <i>Fathers and Sons</i>, Pete Dexter's

novel <i>Deadwood</i>, and historical accounts, Hill's script creatively

reconstructs what happened when a fatigued and ocularly challenged Wild Bill

stayed a spell (his last) in Deadwood. It's about the inevitable consequences

of forgotten deeds. As soon as Bill arrives, Jack McCall (David Arquette), an

odd, unformed boy-man, announces that he's going to kill him. California Joe

repeatedly offers to murder McCall, while Charley and Calamity try to keep Bill

together body and soul. McCall contends that Hickok deserted his mother--he

can't stand to see the man who left her lionized. Although Bill refuses to

explain or apologize, he suspects that the kid is right. Bill wounded McCall's

mother, Susannah, twice: when he abandoned her for a scouting mission, and when

he returned and shot her new man dead. <p>



With his eyes going and his ethical code shaken, Bill is caught between the

magnetic attraction of his fame and his own need to slow down. Yes, this is the

old story of the champion gunslinger who has become too juicy a target. But

there's internal tension, too. Bill positions himself with his friends and

public as an ordinary fellow while accepting a hero's mantle. He's growing

tired of the balancing act. If yuppie audiences can find this movie, it might

strike a chord, because <i>Wild Bill </i>shows how the game-playing of youth

can overtake them or use them up--and how rising generations are ready to

exploit their weakness. <p>



For respite Bill visits a Chinese opium den, and has a troubling,

marvel-flecked memory while under the drug. Out hunting with California Joe and

others, he pursues a fox that eerily vanishes into snow; he returns to find his

campsite threatened by ten Cheyenne dog soldiers, whose leader asks if he has

seen "the little dog." Cleverly improvising, Bill says that he chased the fox

into the netherworld, where the creature predicted a long life for him. The

Cheyenne leader applauds Bill's brazenness, but says that the next time Bill

sees the little dog, he won't survive another moon. Bill's biography is like

that--a contest between kismet and his own made-up fortune.<p>



Hill's moviemaking is like that too. A spontaneous, lyrical strain has always

tugged at the well-wrought terseness of Hill's writing and direction. It

emerges strongly in the edgy freshness of the acting. Bridges's magnitude might

have been predicted from his credit sheet: he's been piling up milestones ever

since he played the stock-car champ Junior Johnson in Lamont Johnson's <i><a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?+Last+American+Hero,+The+(1973)">The

Last American Hero</a></i> (1973). But he comes up with a mixture of fierceness and

limpidity that's continually surprising.<p>

 

<font size=5>Y</font>ET the aesthetic charge of <i>Wild Bill </i>goes beyond performance. In

collaboration with his cinematographer, Lloyd Ahern, and his editor, Freeman

Davies, Hill gets as close as any contemporary director to the

<i>cam&eacute;ra-stylo </i>ideal: using the lens as a pen, or maybe a gunsight.

The imagery's liquid pull is seductive; Hill lets viewers think they're

discovering for themselves where the bullets fly, just as DeMille did when his

Hickok picked off Indians. The spectrum of this movie is amazing: if Deadwood

during the day looks muddy and baleful, at night, when Bill drifts toward

Chinatown, it takes on pre-neon colors. Sometimes the screen whites out at

moments of fatal impact, a device that subliminally keys into the

black-and-white shadow play occurring in Wild Bill's head. (One of the film's

many eloquent details is the shadow puppets in the Chinese quarter.) Hill

actually shot Bill's flashbacks on black-and-white videotape and then converted

them to film. He explained the choice to me this way: "I wanted a feeling that

was lighter and more buoyant than you'd get with a normal hand-held

motion-picture camera. If we lost detail, that was fine as long as we could

tell what was going on, because I also wanted to reproduce an overexposed,

Matthew Brady look, something that would seem more real for the period and more

personal and true for the rendering of memory."<p>

 

Paradoxically, that use of video technology is the sort of inspiration that

would hit a movie-bred director, not someone who jumped into films from

television. Hill, fifty-three, said that he can't disagree "with the constant

drum roll of articles about why movies aren't better. "He continued, "The

argument goes that it's the televisionization of the form--the demand for

narrative shortcuts and immediate sensation. Going for those is something that

everybody used to accuse me of--but I always thought I was doing them in

another context, exploring what was interesting about comic-book and

pulp-fiction techniques. Comic books and pulp may not be the top rung on the

ladder, but they <i>are </i>part of literary tradition." <p>



Hill perceives deterioration at every level of the movie business. "The story

meetings are vastly cruder than they were twenty-five years ago. The people

making decisions are totally dependent on readers, and unlike the old days,

when reading for studios could be a thirty-year profession, readers today have

no background--they're young people who want to be screenwriters or, worse,

executives. They want to promote themselves to positions where they don't have

to read scripts." <p>



Despite his hard-guy reputation, Hill feels out of synch with the industry

prototypes for action movies: "The contemporary Schwarzenegger-Stallone thing

is fundamentally different from the Steve McQueen, Burt Lancaster, and Lee

Marvin movies we used as models in the sixties and seventies. The modern action

film has become in effect a science-fiction film, and I don't lean that way

myself." To Hill, even those movies currently held up as exemplars of the form

reduce human dimensions and over-rely on effects. <p>



"I was at one point involved in <i><a href= "http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?+Fugitive,+The+(1993)">The Fugitive</a></i>, and I didn't do it, and it

proved to be an incredible success. But saying that up front, I have to note

that it's finally less complex than the TV series. In the series the hero had a

troubled marriage with an alcoholic woman and they were debating whether they

should have a child and would the marriage hold together. All this deepened the

notion that when his wife was killed, he felt somehow guilty even if he was

innocent, and it enabled David Janssen to play the part as if he were guilty. I

always thought the <a href= "http://www.opendoor.com/MCW/ADZ/fugitive.html">TV <i>Fugitive</a></i>was comic-book Dostoyevsky: because the

hero was accused, he took on not only the surface aspects of guilt but the

persona of guilt, the angst of it--and that's a much more complicated vision

than the movie's. But this aspect of the movie, to the best of my knowledge,

was unchallenged by any critic at that level. It was very well made, and Tommy

Lee Jones was excellent, and one could say that its sheer entertainment value

dismissed any other considerations. But when a TV series of the sixties is

deeper than a movie of the nineties, aren't those considerations we should

examine?" <p>



Although Hill says, "I don't want to sound like <i>The New York Times</i>," he

has grown to recognize that "movies are not going to get a hell of a lot better

until writers and directors read more books and see fewer films." One American

writer who comes up in conversation with Hill is <a href= "http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/as/Literature/Bierce/forked.html">Ambrose Bierce</a>. <i>Wild

Bill</i>, like Bierce's Civil War stories ("<a href= "http://www.algonet.se/~artbin/ooccurr.html">An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge</a>,"

"Chickamauga"), suggests that if you look at physical reality penetratingly

enough, or from a fresh, oblique angle, you can pierce through to the

metaphysical. But Hill isn't as mordant as Bierce. He told Jeff Bridges that he

made <i>Wild Bill </i>to celebrate "a certain historical expansion of the

American spirit." The result fulfills Hill's own manifest destiny.

<i>The U.S. embargo on

Vietnam does not prevent other countries from doing business there, but it does

prevent the country from rebuilding itself.</i></b><p>

</center>

<p>

<br>

<font size=5>T</font>he U.S. attempt to starve Vietnam out, through a political and economic

embargo, is senseless. Most Americans are not even aware that such a campaign

is under way. After all, within the past year the U.S. government has

re-approved most-favored-nation trade status for China, prepared to donate food

to the Soviet Union, found a way to coexist with the brutal new SLORC regime in

Burma, and applied a forgive-and-forget economic policy to most nations other

than Iraq. But in Vietnam the U.S. embargo remains the central fact of economic

life. It makes existence undeservedly miserable for many millions of people,

while doing no visible good for anyone -- except, perhaps, for businessmen in

Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, and Japan.<p>



<p>



<p>



What the Vietnamese refer to as "the embargo" is really two policies. One is

the U.S. government's attempt to prevent Americans from buying from, selling

to, investing in, or otherwise having anything to do with Vietnam. Under

prevailing Supreme Court rulings the government cannot prevent Americans from

traveling to Vietnam, but it gums up other dealings with impediments large and

small. AT&amp;T and the other American phone companies will not place a call

from the United States to Vietnam. (If you want to send a fax to a university

or a government office in Vietnam, you send it instead to someone in

Bangkok -- or, for that matter, Toronto -- and ask to have it passed on. The people

most harshly affected by the phone ban are, of course, the million or so

Vietnamese-Americans, many of whom have relatives in Vietnam.) Last year

several thousand U.S. citizens, most of them Vietnamese Americans or U.S.

military veterans, traveled to Vietnam -- but the Lindblad travel agency, in

Connecticut, lost more than $500,000 in fines and legal fees for daring to

organize such tours and subsequently declared bankruptcy. Tours are legally and

profitably organized by several big agencies in Bangkok. Air Vietnam, which has

a monopoly on flights within the country, carries passengers on a fleet of

dirty and decrepit Soviet planes. Yet when the airline was angling last year to

buy an Airbus from Europe, the U .S. government discouraged the sale, because

the plane's engines are made by General Electric. Hotels and government shops

in Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, have bright new signs saying that Visa

cards are accepted -- but not if you are a U.S. citizen, or if the card was

issued in the United States, or if it is drawn on an American bank. In those

circumstances the Vietnamese won't take the card, because U .S. Treasury

Department regulations forbid the banks to pay. The U.S. dollar is in practice

the legal tender of Vietnam. Trade contracts are denominated in dollars; hotel

and restaurant prices are set in dollars; visitors from Japan, Italy, and even

the Soviet Union must carry around wads of t U.S. currency with which to settle

their bills. Yet under the charmingly named Trading With the Enemy Act, the U

.S. government behaves as if every one of those dollars were there

illegitimately. The United States was intimately involved with Vietnam for more

than a decade. Now Vietnam is one of only a handful of countries with which the

United States attempts to prevent all diplomatic and economic interaction.<p>



<p>



<p>



The second part of the embargo policy consists of U.S. pressure on the World

Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund to keep

them, too, from dealing normally with Vietnam. Although the United States is

the single biggest force in each of these organizations, on its own it cannot

dictate their policies. But the Japanese representatives, who make up the

second-largest voting bloc, have lined up behind the United States on this

issue, and together the two countries have stonily kept most international

organizations out of Vietnam. The United Nations operates a few small

development-aid programs and an extensive refugee-processing system within

Vietnam, but in general Vietnam must exist outside the network of loans,

international credits, financial restructuring plans, and so forth that

countries from Ghana to Peru to Bangladesh can participate in. (Technically,

the IMF excludes Vietnam not because of the embargo but because Vietnam hasn't

paid off some $140 million in old debts. Vietnam is hardly the only Third World

country in arrears. Its problem could be cleared up with bridge loans, as has

been done in many other countries, if Japanese and American banks could get

involved.) Apart from the Soviet Union -- which has for the past decade

subsidized Vietnam's economy, received tens of thousands of Vietnamese guest

workers, and provided cut-rate shipments of fertilizer and oil -- Sweden and

Finland are the only nations that have given Vietnam substantial amounts of

foreign aid.<p>



<p>



<p>



Of the two components of the embargo, the pressure on international

organizations is the more important. Vietnam has what is politely referred to

as an "infrastructure problem." The roads, the telephones, the electrical-power

network, and the water and sewage systems are terrible or nonexistent. I asked

Vo Dai Luoc, of the Institute for World Economy, in Hanoi, "which problem is

most urgent? Transportation? Communications? Power?" He answered, "yes" -- and

not because he misunderstood me. The amount of money needed to create a

telephone system for 6 million people, rebuild roads not maintained for twenty

years, and renovate antique seaports and airports is more than any private

investor will put up. Since the end of the Second World War mammoth

infrastructure projects in many parts of the world have typically been

sponsored by the World Bank or other international lending organizations; this

is how Japan built its Bullet Train system in the 1960s. Other countries

throughout Asia draw constantly on World Bank and Asian Development Bank advice

and loans. Vietnam cannot, because the United States says no. Thailand,

Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam are inching toward cooperation on several Mekong

River projects, to cope with the environmental ruin of the Southeast Asian

forests. The Mekong committee's office in Hanoi has a thick folder of requests

for funding: so much to monitor water quality, so much to restock fish, so much

to offset the intrusion of salt water into the Mekong Delta region. None of

this can go anywhere so long as Vietnam is classified as a pariah.<p>



<p>



<p>



Americans might say that they just don't feel like subsidizing the

reconstruction of Vietnam. The U.S. government's policy goes further than that:

it is an attempt to keep Vietnam from rebuilding itself. Vietnam's population

is very young, and most people can barely remember when U.S. troops were in

their country. It is hard to see how today's Vietnamese children bear

responsibility for the wounds the United States suffered during those years.

Yet policies left over from the bitter 1960s and 1970s help keep them poor.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



What is the point of it all -- of the small-minded restrictions on Americans and

the serious limitations on Vietnam? There are two ways of judging America's

policy: on the basis of what it's supposed to do, and on the effect that it

actually has.<p>



<p>



<p>



The stated rationale for the embargo has shifted over the years. The Trading

With the Enemy Act, enacted in 1917 as an anti-German tool, was applied to

North Vietnam in 1964, when that country was in fact the military enemy. The

law was extended to the country as a whole after the North Vietnamese conquest

of the South (or, to put it in the terms that are officially used in Vietnam

these days, after the "Liberation" that eliminated the "puppet forces"), in

1975. Since 1979, when the Vietnamese completed their invasion of Cambodia,

drove out Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge regime, and established their own dependent

government, U.S. policy has been tied to events in Cambodia. For ten years the

United States insisted that Vietnam withdraw its occupying forces. In the

opinion of most foreign governments, Vietnam did exactly that late in 1989 -- as

Secretary of State James Baker officially acknowledged last summer. Baker

acknowledged the withdrawal, however, less as an occasion for U.S.-Vietnamese

rapprochement than as evidence that the hard-line policy was working: because

of American implacability, the Vietnamese had finally given in.<p>



<p>



<p>



The negotiations over Cambodia's future are of hopeless, Middle East-like

complexity. The essential point is that the United States is ostracizing

Vietnam for the sake of a bargaining position -- not because Vietnam has outraged

international standards of decency. Vietnam did invade Cambodia, and does

continue to prop up and manipulate the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK),

the nominal government of Cambodia. But China continues to prop up the Khmer

Rouge, which is still directed by the same people who wrought genocide in the

1970s, and which continues to take over Cambodian territory with Chinese guns

and supplies. If the United States felt inclined to get moralistic (again)

about Southeast Asia, the most appropriate target for its wrath would be not

Vietnam but China, without whose sustenance the Khmer Rouge could not survive.

But the Bush Administration seems to act on the assumption that ancient, mighty

China cannot be swayed by outside pressure. Therefore the United States

continues to squeeze Vietnam.<p>



<p>

In a way the years of squeezing have paid off. Vietnam has grown weary enough

of its exile that it has compromised on some points, especially by withdrawing

its troops. But its officials have consistently made clear that they can never,

ever countenance the return of the Khmer Rouge. This is not so much because

they are squeamish about what might happen inside Cambodia as because when the

Khmer Rouge was in power, its army kept attacking villages in Vietnam. As best

I could judge from two weeks of interviews with officials in Vietnam, the

emotional and logical content of their position is comparable to what Soviet

leaders would now feel if Hitler were still alive and had a panzer force

threatening to take control of Poland. Officially, the U.S. policy, too, is

designed to keep out the Khmer Rouge. But until the Vietnamese are sure that

some other, still unspecified arrangement will provide sure protection against

the Khmer Rouge, they will stick with their pet PRK.<p>



<p>



<p>



The strongest argument for continuing the embargo is that some agreement among

the many squabbling Cambodian factions has seemed through the past year to be

in sight. Why relax the pressure on the Vietnamese as the Soviet Union cuts

back on its subsidies? But Americans could just as easily argue that now is the

time to reward Vietnam for the steps it has taken, and to encourage it to take

more. This is exactly the logic we have applied to China and the Soviet Union

within the past year. Nguyen Co Thach, the Vietnamese Foreign Minister, is

known to have argued internally that Vietnam would be rewarded for withdrawing

from Cambodia and undertaking its ambitious doi moi program of economic

liberalization. As long as the embargo continues, he is proved wrong.<p>



<p>



<p>



There is, of course, a reason why Vietnam seems less lovable and forgivable

than the Soviet Union of Gorbachev's reformers or the China of the Tiananmen

Square demonstrators. Although U.S. policy does not explicitly link the embargo

to the MIA issue, the suspicion that the Vietnamese are still locking up

American prisoners, or hoarding their bones, generates considerable ill will.

The Vietnamese government has not exactly helped its own cause by doling out

remains two or three at a time and seeming to treat the bodies as useful

bargaining chips. In 1980 a mortician who had fled Vietnam told a congressional

committee that he had seen the bones or bodies of several hundred American

soldiers stored in a warehouse outside Hanoi. Although the North Vietnamese

Communists seemed to understand American psychology very well during the war

years, the case can be made that they barely understand the United States at

all. During the Carter years the Vietnamese government queered a chance for

normalization by demanding reparations; only recently has the emotional power

of the MIA question sunk in. Members of the American "reconciliation team"

working on the POW/MIA issue say that their Vietnamese counterparts have been

more cooperative in recent months.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Even if it made sense on its own big-think strategic terms, the embargo would

have a serious practical limitation: it doesn't scare away anyone but the

Americans. The embargo has succeeded in stunting and distorting the Vietnamese

economy, and in keeping American businesses out of Indochina; but it is more

and more obviously failing to keep out businesses from other countries, or to

bring the Vietnamese government to its knees.<p>



<p>



<p>



Although many nations condemned Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1979, almost

no one agrees with America's embargo anymore. All other major nations have

embassies in Hanoi. None imposes Trading With the Enemy-style limits on its

citizens or businesses who want to trade with Vietnam. The Japanese government,

with its down-the-line support of the embargo in international organizations,

illustrates how shallow the enthusiasm for the embargo is. Officially it will

not let Japanese firms invest in Vietnam, to avoid offending the United States.

In some cases, however, Japanese banks and corporations have channeled money

through front organizations in Indonesia or Hong Kong, which then invest in

Vietnam. And there is no visible restriction on Japanese trade with Vietnam.

This year Japan should overtake the Soviet Union as Vietnam's leading trade

partner, Japanese firms sold $.300 million to $400 million worth of

manufactured products to Vietnam last year, mainly in exchange for Vietnamese

crude oil. (Although Vietnam is potentially a large oil producer, it has only a

few working oil wells now, and virtually no refineries. Therefore it exports

crude oil to Japan, in exchange for machinery, and has until recently relied on

the Soviet Union for refined oil. The end of the Soviet-subsidized oil supply

is the most immediately pressing economic problem.) All the vehicles on

Vietnam's streets which are not Soviet-made are from Japan. All the

refrigerators, TVs, and VCRs that are not Japanese are Korean. In Saigon's

major hotels -- the Rex, the Caravelle, the Majestic, and the Continental -- blocks

of rooms are on long-term lease to Japanese trading firms such as Nissho Iwai

and Mitsubishi. One of the malicious delights of traveling in today's Vietnam

is watching Germans, Soviets, Italians, and even incredulous Frenchmen being

made to conduct their business in English. The Japanese businessmen and

travelers I saw were doing their business largely in Japanese.<p>



<p>



<p>



Most other countries don't even bother to keep up appearances. The Taiwanese,

who have cultural and linguistic ties to the Chinese community in southern

Vietnam, see no reason to abide by the American policy. After all, the United

States does not even classify Taiwan as a real country anymore. (The United

States has in Taipei not an embassy but an "American Institute." U.S. diplomats

who are assigned there must temporarily resign from the foreign service.) Of

the foreign firms with whom Vietnam has set up some 200 joint ventures since

liberalizing its foreign-investment law three years ago, the most enthusiastic

seem to be from Taiwan. One of the largest, called Pan Viet, is building new

apartment blocks, producing ceramic tile and paint, running an

agricultural-experiment station, and even planning to develop a suburb for

foreign residents with a golf course and an international school to be ready

for Americans when they decide to come back. Companies from France, Australia,

Holland, and Italy participate in other joint ventures. In all, foreign firms

have invested more than $2.2 billion in new capital.<p>



<p>



<p>



Australia enjoys a trade surplus with Vietnam, importing fish and grains and

having sold, among other things, three large satellite dishes to handle

international phone calls. ("Now I can call Paris and Bangkok," an official of

the Ministry of Commerce told me in Hanoi. "The problem is calling Haiphong.")

There are huge billboards from the Korean corporate giants Daewoo and Samsung

near the entrances of the airports in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. During my

stay I met technicians from Ireland working on the telephone system, a

pharmaceutical salesman from Italy, a handicrafts dealer from Holland, and a

French engineer working on Vietnam's offshore oil fields. The manager of a

Vietnamese shipping line guilelessly explained to me how Vietnamese handicrafts

reach customers in America: first the ship goes to Vancouver, then all the

documents are changed, and then it goes on to the United States. The prize for

hypocrisy regarding the embargo goes easily to Singapore. Its official policy

toward Vietnam is, if anything, more ferocious than that of the United States,

but most of the Coca-Cola, EverReady batteries, and other Western goods stacked

in markets in virtually every Vietnamese city come through merchants in

Singapore. Each week passengers fly between Ho Chi Minh City and Singapore,

although the flights are not listed on any schedules. Whenever an article

appears describing the commercial involvement of Singapore in Vietnam, the

Singapore government declares that it is simply shocked by the news.<p>



<p>



<p>



Vietnamese officials have recently figured out that they can play on American

age-of-decline insecurity in their arguments against the embargo. Shortly

before the "Liberation," Mobil discovered the sizable "White Tiger" oilfield in

Vietnamese waters in the South China Sea. Last year Vietnam assigned

exploration rights for several sites to companies from Canada, France, Kuwait,

and elsewhere, but not to U.S. firms. Mobil and Texaco, along with Citibank,

have sent exploratory missions to Vietnam. The American chambers of commerce in

Bangkok and Hong Kong, representing U.S. companies operating there, last year

formally recommended that the embargo be lifted, to end "the continuing loss of

U.S. business opportunities in Vietnam to global competitors." Raymond Eaton,

an Australian businessman based in Bangkok, has become famous locally for

speeches arguing that non-U.S. companies should seize the "golden opportunity"

that the embargo creates and "do your very utmost to capitalize on the total

inability of American companies to compete against you." (Eaton also urges the

United States to eliminate the "golden opportunity" by lifting the embargo.)

The manager of a building project in Hanoi told me, "We hoped very much to use

American elevator equipment in our building, but, you know..." Vo Dai Luoc, of

the Institute for World Economy, told me, "In the past the United States spent

billions of dollars to establish its influence in this part of the world. It

was not possible that way, but simply by permitting business relations the

United States may succeed in obtaining a role in this region."<p>



<p>



<p>



The real reason the embargo persists, of course, is that we lost the war. That

is also the reason that, although we can forgive the Soviet Union and

Nicaragua, we can't forgive Vietnam -- even though it is a relatively

well-behaved country now, with economic-reform plans as impressive as most in

Eastern Europe. Shortly before I left for Vietnam, I talked with an American

politician who agreed that the embargo no longer made sense. But it might

continue, out of inertia, for a long time. "It's all up to the war heroes," he

said. When politicians like the senators John McCain, Robert Kerrey, and John

Kerry -- men who fought and suffered in Vietnam -- say it is time to forgive their

former enemies, he told me, then others can safely go along. But until then, he

said, it is not safe or sensible even to mention the name Vietnam.<p>



<p>



<p>



It's natural that we would prefer never to think about Vietnam again. Being

involved there did us great harm. So with a kind of unconscious spite we

continue a policy that hobbles an entire nation and helps us not at all, mainly

because a generation ago we came to grief there. In decency we should stop.<p>

<blockquote>





	<font size=5>T</font>HE personal-computer era is about twenty years old, 

	dating from some point

between the founding of Microsoft, in 1975, and the introduction of the IBM

Personal Computer, in 1981. People have continually marveled at how fast

everything is changing. But never before have the fundamentals of the business

changed as quickly or as dramatically as they have in the past year and a half,

because of the sudden popularity of the Internet.<p>

Less than two years ago an auditorium's worth of high-powered computing

executives watched in fascination as one of their colleagues demonstrated

something called the World Wide Web. (A report on the meeting appeared in the

July, 1994, issue of this magazine. For those joining us late: The Internet is

the supernetwork that links computer networks around the world. "The Web" is a

graphically oriented system that makes it easy for someone using one computer

connected to the Internet to inspect and collect information from another

computer connected to the Internet, no matter where those computers might be.

Such transactions have been possible for years, but the Web allows users to

perform them merely by clicking on little symbols, which are connected to files

or other computers in a series of hypertext links.) Now children in elementary

school have their own Web pages, and beer and car companies put their Web-site

addresses in their advertisements. <p>

The popularity of the Web has enriched certain companies, particularly

Netscape, which makes the most popular "Web browsing" software, and Sun

Microsystems, the leading supplier of the "server" computers on which the

Internet runs. It has also raised questions about the future of the industry's

dominant firm, <A HREF=http://www.microsoft.com/>Microsoft</A>--a debate that has important implications for all

computer users.<p>





The debate concerns whether the growth of the Internet will strengthen or

dilute Microsoft's ability to set standards for the software industry. For more

than a decade Microsoft's great achievement has been to have its operating

systems--first MS-DOS and then Windows--accepted as the nearly universal

standard for IBM-style computers. This guaranteed an ever-increasing cash flow,

since the sale of nearly every computer meant the sale of a Microsoft operating

system. It also made Microsoft's word-processing programs, spreadsheets, and

other software more attractive than their competitors from, say, Borland

International or Lotus Development Corporation, since customers knew they would

always be compatible with Microsoft operating systems. Last summer, as the

company prepared to release its ballyhooed Windows 95 software, which comes

with a built-in Internet connection, those most fearful of Microsoft's

influence worried that the company was about to project its standard-making

power onto the Internet as a whole. Within a few years, they said, the

Microsoft Network might crush CompuServe, America Online, and other commercial

networks, and some Microsoft-created browser might supplant Netscape as the

industry standard.<p>

Shortly after the release of Windows 95 the members of another camp made their

surprising, and opposite, case. They said that far from strengthening

Microsoft, the rise of the Internet might impose a limit on the company's

expansion and influence. According to this line of reasoning, the question was

not whether Microsoft's software was better or worse than anyone else's but

whether most kinds of software people now buy were about to become less

important.<p><pre>

</pre>

<font size=5>T</font>HIS argument involves the programming language 

<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/">Java</A>,

 which was developed by

Sun Microsystems and which suddenly became famous at the end of last year. The

idea behind Java, to oversimplify, is that it could make a computer work like a

telephone. The nation's telephone network is an enormously complex

software-and-hardware combination, but the average user does not need to think

about its complexities for a minute (except for the horror of selecting among

long-distance plans). You buy whatever phone you want; you plug it in; it

works. When the companies offer some new service--call forwarding, voice

mail--you don't have to buy extra memory chips for your phone or get an upgrade

for your telephone software, as you would in the computer world. You keep using

your old phone.<p>

And so it could be in the world of computers, according to the Java theory.

Java is a way to let your computer borrow and use programs that exist on the

central network--like the switching and call-forwarding programs on the

telephone network--even though you have never bought or installed them. If you

were working on a financial problem, you might locate an Internet site that had

data you wanted. Using the Java protocol, that site would instantaneously ship

you the most up-to-date version of the particular spreadsheet or statistical

routines you needed to analyze the data. When these "applets," or small program

components, had solved your problem, they would disappear from your machine.

Presumably,  in some way not yet specified, you would pay a small fee

somewhere, as you do for use of the different services available by telephone.

You wouldn't need to worry whether you had found the right files for the latest

release of your favorite program. Your computer wouldn't need to be a huge

battleship, with more raw power than ran the Apollo project and with hard

drives capable of storing gigabytes of complex programs. It would simply need

to be able to connect to the Internet and receive and run programs sent by Java

(which is compatible with nearly any kind of computer and nearly any operating

system). Conceivably Java could lead to the production of stripped-down

"Internet terminals," costing $500 or so, which could turn up where pay phones

do today. Rather than take portable computers with them, people could send

messages from an Internet terminal in one airport as they departed and collect

them from another after they arrived. <p>



This vision of telephone-like computers, busily touted by Sun representatives

since late last year, might never come true. In the short term it faces the

ugly reality that existing Internet phone connections are just too slow and

overtaxed to handle the high-capacity traffic a Javaed world would require.

When I visited Sun's headquarters last fall and watched a Java demonstration by

Eric Schmidt, the chief technology officer, an embarrassing slowdown kept the

demo from loading at all. Even Sun's internal lines, it seemed, were congested,

because end-of-quarter financial data were being passed around. <p>







Last December, Microsoft seemed to acknowledge the importance of Java when it

said that it would license the technology for use with its software.

Immediately another of the religious wars that always surround Microsoft's

actions broke out in the computer world. Some people said this was a sign that

Microsoft, ever realistic, had abandoned hope of bending the Internet to its

own standards. Others said that Microsoft, ever resourceful, would figure out a

way to put its own proprietary stamp on Java--much as the company had done a

decade before when it made the Macintosh-like graphic interface part of its own

Windows.<p>



This argument will play out over the next few years, while we wait for phone

lines to become fast enough to give Java a serious trial. In the meantime, the

idea behind Java--that the Internet, which we cannot see or really imagine,

will take over functions now performed on the computer--applies to the part of

computing that has always been the most interesting and will become

increasingly valuable. This is the ability to find information that we actually

want.<p><pre>

</pre>

<font size=5>S</font>OME computer functions are so deeply ingrained in modern life that they are no

longer interesting: word processing, E-mail and data transfer, spreadsheets and

financial analysis. The programs that handle these functions are mature and

complete enough to be merely tools. At the other extreme are tasks that will

never be successfully computerized. I am convinced that I will never see a

computer that can take a recording of normal conversation and convert it into

text, or one that can translate a document from Japanese to English without

numerous howlers. In between are the interesting challenges--the tasks that are

hard but not impossible for computers and potentially very valuable for 

users.<p>



Information retrieval is at the top of the list. If our own computers give us

information by the ton, the Internet can provide it in Krakatoan quantities. It

is sometimes hard to find anything whatsoever of value on the Internet, with so

many sites listing such things as the personal TV-show preferences of people

you have never met or showing "live cam" shots of office workers in Germany.

Finding the particular facts you are looking for can seem impossible. Yet in

the long run the Internet, which links together many of the world's data

resources, should be the ideal research vehicle.<p>



Tools are available for finding information in the limited universe of one's

own desktop computer, and for now they are indispensable, if space-hogging and

sometimes cumbersome. Back in the primitive old DOS days, I relied on two

now-orphaned programs from Lotus--Magellan and Agenda--to search for a fact or

name in some long-forgotten disk file, and to organize the facts thereby

retrieved. (Sorry: once again you'll get no Macintosh references from me. If I

had had perfect foresight, I would have started down the Mac road a dozen years

ago, because Macintosh systems, while more expensive, are much less harassing

to use than IBM PC-style models. But I took the road more traveled.) I still

find Agenda indispensable when I want to organize data for a writing project.

Like the 1964 Mustang, it has been replaced but not improved upon. For bulk

storage of research material--interview notes, material scanned in from

newspaper or magazine clippings, citations from online sources, and so on--I

have come to love and rely upon a program named askSam. <p>



When it made its debut, about ten years ago, 

<A HREF="http://www.asksam.com/asksam.htm">askSam</A> was a nerd's delight, from

its peculiar name to its arcane command structure to its ugly on-screen

appearance. Its compensating virtue was its ability to search large quantities

of data quickly. Its newest release, version 3.0, is attractive and easy to use

and yet is faster and more powerful than ever. I dump all my research data into

a big askSam file (once, my file totaled nearly fifteen megabytes) and within a

second or two I can call back any particular document or clipping, using

askSam's index of keywords. (The askSam company's phone number is 800-800-1997.

A stripped-down but perfectly adequate version of the program costs $149.95.

The full-scale "professional" version, which can handle larger files and has

other features, costs $395.) As one who still believes that the IBM operating

system OS/2 Warp is faster, stronger, and more reliable than Windows 95, I also

use a phenomenally speedy Warp retrieval program called Search Manager/2, which

can find names or phrases not just in the askSam research files but anywhere on

my hard disks. (It costs $79, from Indelible-Blue, 800-776-8284.) While I'm at

it, I should mention that the new release of Xerox's optical

character-recognition software, TextBridge Professional version 3.0, does the

best job I've yet seen of converting printed material into text for a computer.

The basic version of <A HREF="http://www.connecti.com/~alamopc/rev6.htm">TextBridge</A> sells for about $75 from mail-order houses. The

"professional" version, with more-advanced editing tools, costs about $250.<p>



But with Java in mind I ask myself, Why should I have these huge research files

on my computer at all? Only a tiny fraction of their bulk represents material

that can be found nowhere else--my own interview notes, E-mail, and so on. Most

of it is information I wouldn't need to keep on the premises if I were sure I

could find and use it when I wanted to. Java proponents say they can spare us

from building up stockpiles of programs that we rarely use. Why shouldn't they

spare us needless data buildup too?<p>



For one limited set of people this prospect is already a reality. A decade ago

journalists following a theme or story kept big yellowing stacks of clippings

on their desks, usually until the desks themselves disappeared. Now few of them

bother with clippings, because they know they can get a citation when they want

it from Lexis-Nexis, the nearly all-inclusive compilation of newspaper and

magazine stories, plus TV and radio broadcasts, which is owned by Reed

Elsevier. The most obvious drawback of Lexis-Nexis is its very steep cost. Fees

are customized for each client, but they range from several hundred to several

thousand dollars a month and essentially rule out the service for people not

associated with some large institution that can afford it. Even if more people

could afford it, <A HREF="http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lncc/">Lexis-Nexis</A> would still be significantly limited as a guide to

the information network of the future.<p>



The problem concerns its "search engine." Nexis, like most of today's searching

programs and databases, works on the principles of Boolean logic that most of

us learned in junior high school. The most important words in the Boolean

dialect are "and," "or," and "not." If you wanted to use Nexis to find an

article that compares President Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter with Harry Truman

but doesn't mention Lyndon Johnson or Dwight Eisenhower, your query would start

out "Clinton OR Carter AND Truman AND NOT Johnson OR Eisenhower." Endless

refinements go on from there, such as specifying when the article appeared

("Date is 1995") or that the names occur close enough to each other that

they're likely to be logically related in the article. For instance, "(Clinton

OR Carter) W/20 Truman" would find appearances of the names within twenty words

of each other.<p>



Boolean searches on Nexis are extremely fast and accurate--as long as you know

exactly what you are looking for. But if you have a more general query, or if

you do not pose your question in precisely the right form, Boolean searches can

lead to random, surprising results. If the article you were thinking of

appeared one day before or after your target period, or if the names you were

looking for were twenty-one rather than twenty words apart, or if owing to a

newspaper typo "Clinton" became "Clnton," you would not find those articles,

and you would never know how close you came. <p>



This is much better than having no search system--modern journalism could

hardly exist without Nexis--but it is still an imperfect tool. Nexis also

offers a non-Boolean search system, called "freestyle," which allows you to

launch more-general queries--"Show me information about IBM's profits." In my

experience freestyle searches are even less effective than the Boolean process

in helping locate the data I am looking for. <p>



Some of the most intriguing research now under way in computerdom, which I will

describe in another article, involves efforts to impose a "find what I mean"

index-and-searching structure on the now-uncharted tracts of the Internet.

Mitchell Kapor, the founder of Lotus, has argued that this effort won't go

anywhere until some equivalent of the Dewey Decimal System is applied to

databases around the world. Only with an idea of where an article or research

paper fits into the general structure of knowledge, he says, can the limits of

hit-or-miss Boolean searching be overcome.<p><pre>

</pre>

 <font size=5>I</font>N one little corner of the Internet something like Kapor's

  plan has already

been applied. Along with the Dewey Decimal System, one of the most ambitious

attempts to categorize information is the "Propaedia," or "Outline of

Knowledge," long a part of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>. The existence

of the Propaedia may in turn explain why the best glimpse of the possibilities

of a usable information network may be the one offered by the stodgy-seeming

old <i>Britannica</i>.<p>

After nearly a decade of preparation the company introduced two electronic

versions of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica </i>in the past year and a half.

The <i>Britannica </i>is available on a CD-ROM now selling for $495, but anyone

who has a modem and an Internet connection should instead consider the

Web-based version. It is less expensive ($150 a year for family use); its

database is updated regularly; and, as in the Java vision, it doesn't care what

kind of machine you use. The <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>'s telephone number

The <i>Britannica</i>'s designers used the Propaedia, ingeniously, as an answer

sheet against which to judge the success of their retrieval system. Their

existing Propaedia structure told them which articles, from various parts of

the encyclopedia, should be pulled up by a general query. ("Why did the League

of Nations fail?" "Which animals have the longest life spans?") Thus they could

adjust the weight of their numerous "search algorithms" to come as close as

possible to pulling up all the relevant articles. These algorithms, or

formulas, measure the frequency of a word's appearance in an article, whether

it shows up in a headline, its proximity to related terms, and, among other

factors, whether it takes on a different meaning when used in a compound--for

example, "social security," which has a meaning distinct from that of its

component words.<p>



The power and nuance of the resulting system is remarkable. I vaguely

remembered that Sir Christopher Wren had been commemorated with a significant

inscription in London. I typed in "What is Wren's epitaph?" Within two seconds,

and after two clicks of the mouse, the screen displayed several paragraphs

about his tomb in St. Paul's Cathedral, which is marked with the phrase

<i>Lector,</i> <i>si monumentum requiris,</i> <i>circumspice </i>--"Reader, if

you seek a monument, look around." I could have found this in the paper

encyclopedia, if I had bothered. But next I asked "What was the history of

slavery in Latin America?"--and I would never have bothered to track down the

dozen or so related articles, from several different volumes, that this inquiry

produced.<p>



The <i>Britannica </i>'s searching system is not perfect, but it has always

given me something useful. It even reminded me of something I used to know:

that Boolean logic is named for the English mathematician George Boole,

1815-1864. I have not yet seen it make an embarrassing mistake. That move it

leaves to the user.

<blockquote>





	<font size=5>I</font>'VE never wondered why practically anything that is delicious toasted is

called "nutty." The natural sugars and fats in nuts when heated provide the

definitive taste of caramelization, against which seemingly everything else

cooked with dry heat--even meat--is compared. Vegetarians, of course, often use

nuts as meat surrogates, for their high protein content. But their high fat

content has made them seem a poor choice for the weight-conscious. <p>



I recently heard welcome news at a conference on nuts and legumes conducted by

Oldways Preservation &amp; Exchange Trust, where a series of respected

nutritionists and weight researchers heartily endorsed nuts as an everyday part

of the diet. The fats in nuts are mostly monounsaturated, the kind now in favor

for their cholesterol-curbing properties. And in several trials people who ate

even as much as half a cup of nuts every day in place of other fats not only

improved their blood-cholesterol levels but reported that they felt sated and

thus less tempted to overeat. Also, the subjects did not gain weight.<p>



I didn't press the assembled experts to bless what is probably confectionary's

finest marriage: hazelnuts and chocolate. I'd already heard other good news

about hazelnuts, which to my mind have, along with pecans, the most distinctive

and elegant flavor. Among all nuts hazelnuts are especially high in

monounsaturated fats and vitamin E, currently much in favor for its properties

as an antioxidant. I didn't push my luck by bringing up ice cream, either,

whose finest forms include hazelnuts. ("Hazelnut" seems to have taken over from

"filbert" as the general name. The difference was always only etymological;

"filbert" probably derives from the French Saint-Philibert, whose feast day

falls in late August, a few weeks before the nut's harvest; "hazelnut" is an

Anglo-Saxon word.)<p> 





			<img src="./nuts.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 alt=""><p>



In the past year I have conducted a worldwide hazelnut hunt, prompted by my

desire to duplicate a kind of biscotti unlike all others I've tasted in Italy.

The best hazelnuts, I had heard, grow in the <A HREF="http://csi2000.csi.it/~piemonte/welcouk.html">Piedmont</A>, the region in the

northwest of Italy that has always been the country's chocolate-making capital

and is the home of gianduia, the ingot-shaped chocolate-hazelnut candy. But I

needed different nuts for these biscotti, which are called <i>tozzetti</i> for

their squat (<i>tozzo)</i>, thumblike shape, and which are softer than the

usual biscotti, because they include olive oil (and lard, if the baker knows

the farmer who killed the pig). The cookies are native to a more southerly

region that produces hazelnuts--the part of Lazio around Viterbo, north of

Rome, where a friend's mother makes them every year after her family harvests

the nuts in their small orchard. <p>



I found a grower in Lazio, Carlo Torre, who is eager to export to America and

who agreed to send me samples. For comparison I obtained Piedmont hazelnuts

from the one U.S. importer who sells them. At local shops I bought hazelnuts

from Oregon and Turkey, the two kinds commonly available here. Then I got

serious, calling botanists in several countries to learn more about why the

nuts I tried tasted so different from one another. By this time I was gearing

up for my annual flourless baking at Passover, for which I always buy

quantities of nuts. I also buy chocolates for friends who celebrate Easter, and

the best chocolates rely on hazelnuts to complete their flavor.<p>



 



Like many matches that in retrospect seem destined, the combination of

hazelnuts and chocolate was a result of accident--wartime shortages. At the

start of the nineteenth century, naval blockades imposed by the English against

Napoleon reduced the supply of cacao arriving from the Americas. The

chocolatiers of the Piedmont, which was under French occupation, used roasted

and ground hazelnuts to extend their short supplies of cocoa solids. In the

1860s the company Caffarel, which still exists, wrapped the candies in gold or

silver paper and gave them the name of a popular local marionette character,

Giandoja, known for his merry gluttony. Their slim flatiron shape is said to

recall the puppet's cap, but it was probably adopted out of practicality--the

paste is too viscous to be molded in any detail. Now every Italian chocolatier

produces what have become known generically as gianduiotti. Few labels bear the

character's mask anymore, as the originals did, but the shape and the foil

wrapping remain.<p>



Today the world celebrates the marriage by eating Nutella, a chocolate-hazelnut

spread that has become something of a mania in Italy, where children use it as

frequently as we use peanut butter, and that has caught on in the United

States, too. The brothers Ferrero began making the spread immediately after the

Second World War, probably in response to renewed shortages of cocoa solids:

the kilogram loaves in which Nutella was originally sold cost a quarter as much

as the same weight of chocolate. Ferrero also had great success with its

gold-wrapped chopped-hazelnut-and-chocolate "rock" (Rocher), similar to the

famous silver-wrapped "kisses" (Baci) from the rival company Perugina.

(Nothing, to my mind, rivals the star-strewn charm of the Baci wrapper, which

encloses little sentimental messages in the spirit of those on pastel-colored

candy hearts.) Ferrero says that today worldwide sales of Nutella exceed those

of all brands of peanut butter combined, which to me seems only natural. Mars,

unsurprisingly, has begun selling its own hazelnut-chocolate spread, named for

its Milky Way bar; the dense brown-and-white cream comes striated.<p>

<pre>

<font size=5>L</font>AST Christmas I had a chance to visit the family orchard that supplies the

nuts for those irresistible <i>tozzetti </i>my friend's mother makes. I was

surprised at how small a hazelnut tree, a member of the birch family, is--like

a modest lilac. The trunks are seldom thicker than a forearm (U.S. trees are

much larger), and the wood is said to be excellent for shepherd's sticks,

because it doesn't splinter. There were still nuts on the trees, each tightly

clustered with two or three distinctly lobed leaves, which are technically

husks. The clusters look like beaten-gold oak leaves and acorns in Greek

jewelry; I expect Martha Stewart to be gilding them soon.<p>



The ground beneath the trees had been carefully cleared, because hazelnuts are

collected after they fall. (Large growers use machines that catch the nuts in

canvas hammocks.) In late August and early September, a few weeks before the

nuts are ripe, the ground is raked--or, in recent times, sprayed with

herbicides. Because hazelnuts grow best on hills near water, the use of

herbicides has resulted in polluted aquifers, especially in the area around

Viterbo; pollution and the need to return to older methods of clearing the land

are currently much discussed.<p>



In my taste comparisons I understood why Piedmont hazelnuts have retained their

reputation. The flavor of Viterbese hazelnuts is very fine, but that of

Piedmont nuts is more intense. Also, the skins of Piedmont nuts come off more

easily after heating (skin adheres more or less tightly by variety), something

that is crucial for candymakers who want to use whole nuts.<p>



Any home baker knows how tedious it is to skin hazelnuts--an essential task,

because the skins are high in astringent tannins. The usual trick is to enclose

the roasted nuts in a clean dish towel and rub them together vigorously, which

will remove most but not all of the skin. Another technique is to boil the nuts

with a bit of baking soda in the water, which evidently loosens the skins

enough so that you can rinse them off, but then you have to wait for the

waterlogged nuts to dry thoroughly, or else roast them longer and with special

care. The pastry chef and teacher Jim Dodge, of the New England Culinary

Institute, instead mists hazelnuts with water before roasting them to loosen

the skins. Flo Braker, the author of several definitive books on baking, offers

a skinning tip I like: freeze hazelnuts after they are roasted, she says, and

the skins will flake off easily. "That way you don't keep eating them while

you're rubbing off the last pieces of skin," she says. "I always used to have

to roast a good third again as many as I needed, because I knew how many my

husband and I would eat while they were still hot."<p>



In my taste comparisons I also learned how easy it is to over-roast hazelnuts.

Since I like toasty flavors so much, I usually think the darker the better. But

the almost pungent taste of hazelnuts--which is much more assertive than the

taste of almonds--is easily obliterated by a minute or two too long in the

oven. Best to roast the nuts in a slow oven, 325 degrees, for about ten minutes,

just until you begin to smell them and they color very lightly.<p>



Unfortunately, the taste I encountered more than any other was rancidity. This

was a problem especially with the nuts I bought locally, because stores have a

tendency to keep nuts on the shelf far too long. The oils oxidize and go rancid

so quickly that the only safe place to store nuts is in the freezer. (This is

why I no longer buy hazelnut oil, whose flavor I love; it has usually been

pressed in France, and by the time I get it the oil has gone off completely.)

You'll have far better luck if you buy unshelled nuts rather than shelled ones,

because they resist oxidation longer. But then, of course, you face the chore

of both shelling and skinning the nuts. <p>



I was disappointed by Oregon hazelnuts. Most are of a variety called

Barcelona--handsome round nuts practically as big as macadamias and with nearly

as little taste. The risk with any hazelnut is a kind of dead woody flavor

along with the characteristic one. Turkish and Oregon nuts, I found, had the

highest proportion of wood flavor, Piedmont the highest proportion of hazelnut

flavor. You can make your own comparison, buying Oregon nuts from a local

store--or mail-ordering them from a reliable company such as Gahler's Hazelnuts

(800-524-8201), to ensure that they're fresh. De Choix, a gourmet importer in

New York, will sell you a four-kilo vacuum-packed bag of shelled and roasted

Piedmont hazelnuts, or will tell you if a store near you sells them in smaller

amounts (800-332-4649).<p>



The Piedmont variety would probably have great difficulty growing in American

soil, according to <A HREF="http://www.grnet.com/waves/business/hazelnut.htm">Cecil Farris</A>, an amateur botanist I discovered through the

Internet who claims to have one of the world's most diverse collections of

hazelnut genetic material at his home, in Lansing, Michigan. It would quickly

succumb to eastern filbert blight, he says. But Farris has worked on blight-

and cold-resistant hazelnut varieties that have great flavor and loose skins,

and he wouldn't mind at all if Oregon growers used them instead of Barcelona,

which has "a woody old kernel and a thick, ugly shell with a kind of pubescent

fuzz at the apex--it hasn't got anything I'm interested in." Farris has his eye

on other wet temperate regions that he thinks would be ideal for hazelnuts: he

describes the Appalachian region between Bristol, Virginia, and Knoxville,

Tennessee, as a kind of latter-day Fertile Crescent, and dreams of using them

like the mighty almond in Hershey bars.<p>

<pre>



</pre>

<font size =5>H</font>AZELNUTS are used in more than sweets, of course. The people who live in areas

where they grow usually serve them as they are, with fruit, letting guests do

the shelling. In the area around Naples hazelnuts are served before and not

after a meal, as a complement to the local Fiano wine. Pliny the Elder

described the Roman practice of grafting grapevines with hazelnut stock, to

strengthen them; the wine from such vines is said to taste of hazelnuts. The

Mastroberardino family, whose vineyards are in the hills near Avellino, where

hazelnuts grow, make an excellent Fiano that is available in the United 

States.<p>



The writer Paula Wolfert says that picada sauces used in Catalan dishes for

final flavoring are thickened with toasted and pounded hazelnuts and almonds

mixed with garlic and hot pepper. She recently told me that in Istanbul those

who can afford them substitute hazelnuts for walnuts in the famous Turkish dish

Circassian chicken, which is scented with saffron, allspice, and red pepper (a

recipe for it appears in her recent <i>The Cooking of the Eastern

Mediterranean</i>).<p>



In <i>Flatbreads and Flavors</i>, a wonderful culinary tour of the

Mediterranean and Asia, Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid give a simple recipe

for dukka, an eastern-Mediterranean nut-and-spice dip: in a mortar and pestle

or a spice grinder, finely crush a half teaspoon of black peppercorns and add a

quarter teaspoon of fresh or dried thyme leaves and a teaspoon of coarse salt.

Pound this together with sixteen finely chopped hazelnuts, which you can toast

or not beforehand. The mixture will keep for several weeks in an airtight

container; just before serving, mash the paste against the sides of a bowl to

release the aromatics. The dip is good with any flatbread, particularly if it

has first been dipped in olive oil, and is especially good with sesame-dusted

bread rings or breadsticks.<p>



Perhaps the ultimate way to taste the caramelized flavors of toasted nuts is

actually to caramelize them, so that they are dramatically shiny and

deliciously toasty. Flo Braker offers a method that is easy but requires a

candy thermometer. Roast very lightly four ounces of shelled hazelnuts (about a

cup) and remove the skins. In a small heavy saucepan combine three tablespoons

of sugar, one tablespoon of water, and, if you have it, a one-inch piece of

vanilla bean. Melt the sugar over low heat and then cook over a medium-high

flame until the mixture reaches 248 degrees. Remove the syrup from the heat, fish

out the vanilla bean, and stir in the nuts. Mix well, return the pan to a

medium flame, and heat until the sugar darkens (don't allow it to turn black).

Off the heat stir in one teaspoon of unsalted butter, which will keep the nuts

from clustering. Spread the mixture onto a baking sheet to cool, separating the

nuts with a fork.<p>



This Passover I'll be using a recipe for chocolate-hazelnut meringues, crisp

around the edges and chewy inside, from my book, <i><A 

HREF="http://www.joyofcoffee.com/flap.htm">The Joy of Coffee</A>. </i>(The

book also contains the recipe for <i>tozzetti</i>; the lard is optional.) I

call them gianduia cookies; in my mother's day they were plain chocolate

kisses, named perhaps for their shape, and reserved for special occasions

because of their delicacy. <p>



Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. On a baking sheet toast a cup of shelled hazelnuts

for ten minutes or so, until they just start to scent the kitchen. Rub off the

skins, trying to resist sampling. Finely chop enough nuts to make a third of a

cup. Lower the oven to 325 degrees, place a rack in the middle, and lightly grease

two baking sheets or line them with parchment paper.<p>



In a mixer on medium speed or with an electric beater beat three large egg

whites until soft peaks form (if you prefer a crisper, less chewy cookie, use

four egg whites). Gradually beat in three quarters of a cup of sugar, scraping

the sides of the bowl; add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and whisk just until

blended. Drizzle in three ounces of semisweet chocolate, melted and cooled, and

add three tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder. Whisk or beat at medium

speed only to combine the chocolate and meringue. Using a rubber spatula, stir

in the chopped and whole nuts. Drop the batter onto the baking sheets by

tablespoonfuls, about two inches apart. Bake one sheet at a time for fifteen to

twenty minutes, or until the cookies are firm. Let them cool completely before

removing them with a spatula.<p>



You don't have to bake to enjoy hazelnuts and chocolate. Gianduiotti made by

Peyrano, the best in Turin, aren't sold in the United States at the moment, but

many other kinds are. And two of my favorite U.S. chocolate makers make and

will send hazelnut chocolates: Fran's, in Seattle (800-422-3726), and Richard

Donnelly, in Santa Cruz, California (408-458-4214). <p>



The rich medieval spice bread panforte combines nuts with citrus peel and

honey; honey (to which I will devote my next article) and nuts is an ancient

combination thought to be medicinal. The best panforte I know comes not from

Italy but from the Cafe Beaujolais, in Mendocino (800-930-0443)--potent and

deeply satisfying. The caf&eacute; makes a version using hazelnuts only, rather

than the usual combination of nuts. It's a purism I advocate.

<blockquote>Charter Day Address delivered at

the University of California on March 28, 1940.

<p>



<p><br><p><br>



<font size=5>T</font><font size=3>HE</font> United States was once proclaimed as the land of the free. Now we are more

often reminded that it has been the profitable home of an acquisitive society.

Greed and 'lust for money,' we are told, determined the course of development

of even the first years of the republic.<p>



<p>



<p>



Yet, as early as 1800 a potent but silent ferment was at work which had nothing

to do with the almighty dollar. In describing conditions at the beginning of

Jefferson's administration, Henry Adams writes as follows: 'European travelers

who passed through America noticed that everywhere, in the White house at

Washington and in log cabins beyond the Alleghenies, except for a few

Federalists every American, from Jefferson and Gallatin down to the poorest

squatter seemed to nourish an idea that he was doing what he could to overthrow

the tyranny which the past had fastened on the human mind.' This idea so widely

disseminated among the citizens of the raw republic of sixteen states seems to

me one of the most essential and continuing elements in the development of

American education. I have ventured to associate with this passion for freedom

of the mind two other closely allied elements--namely, a belief in careers open

to all through higher education, and a faith in universal schooling. I have

labeled the whole with Jefferson's name. I trust that neither his shade nor

American historians will be unduly offended by my terminology.<p>



<p>



<p>



In his brief autobiographical sketch Jefferson wrote that he deemed it

essential to a well-ordered republic to annul hereditary privilege. He proposed

'instead of an aristocracy of wealth, of more harm and danger, than benefit, to

society, to make an opening for the aristocracy of virtue and talent, which

nature has wisely provided for the direction of the interests of society, and

scattered with equal hand through all its conditions....' Elsewhere, in

describing his new educational scheme for Virginia, he speaks of that part of

his plan which called for 'the selection of the youths of genius from among the

classes of the poor.'  He declared, 'We hope to avail the State of those

talents which nature has sown as liberally among the poor as the rich, but

which perish without use, if not sought for and cultivated.'  These quotations

sum up for me the second component in the Jeffersonian tradition in

education--a sincere belief in the paramount importance of careers freely open

to all the talented.<p>



<p>



<p>



Most important for its effect on the development of American educational

practice was the third element of the tradition--Jefferson's devotion to the

principle of universal schooling.  This doctrine naturally has had more general

popular appeal throughout the years than either concern for freedom of the mind

or desire for opportunity through higher education.  For here was a proposition

which directly affected every family in the land.  To quote from the proposal

for Virginia, 'The ultimate result of the whole scheme of education would be

the teaching of all the children of the State reading, writing and common

arithmetic...'  These words of Jefferson may now seem to us to describe a

degree of general education so small as to be negligible.  But when they were

written they expressed a revolutionary doctrine--a belief that every potential

citizen in a democratic republic should receive at least a minimum of formal

instruction.  The campaign against illiteracy had begun in earnest.<p>



<p>



<p>



As a recent biographer has said, Jefferson believed that any boy or girl was

capable of benefiting from the rudiments of education and would be made a

better citizen by acquiring them.  He believed in keeping open the door of

further opportunity to the extent that a poor boy of ability should not be

debarred from continuing his education.  'To have gone farther and made a

higher education compulsory on all,' suggests this biographer, 'would have

seemed as absurd to him as to have decreed that every crop on his farm, whether

tobacco, potatoes, rye, corn, or what not, must be treated and cultivated in

precisely the same way as every other....In terms of the citizen, he believed

in the maximum of equality of opportunity.  In terms of the state, he believed

in the minimum of compulsion and interference compatible with the training of

all its citizens as citizens to the maximum of the capacity of each.'<p>



<p>



<p>



To understand the bearing of Jefferson's ideas on the development of American

schools and colleges we must realize, of course, that they represented only one

aspect of a wider social philosophy.  As this philosophy was understood by

large numbers of the citizens of the young republic, it included the following

points: a belligerent belief in individual freedom; complete confidence in the

powers of man's intelligence to overcome all obstacles; the assumption of a

society without hereditary classes, without an aristocracy; a differentiation

of labors with a corresponding differentiation in the types of education (but

no ruling caste, no hereditary educational privileges, everyone to be 'as good

as everyone else'); widespread education for all citizens so that political

decisions might be 'rational.'  Dominating all was the doctrine of the maximum

independence of the individual, the minimum of social control by organized

society.<p>



<p>



<p>



<b> <center><font size=4>I.</b></center></font><p>



<p>



<p>



Some such set of ideas as I have grouped together under Jefferson's name would

have been widely recognized, I believe, as 'American ideals,' in every period

of our national history.  To understand their significance for the future let

us examine one by one the three components of the Jeffersonian tradition in

American education.<p>



<p>



<p>



Hatred of tyranny in general and a desire to overthrow the tyranny which the

past had fastened on the human mind went hand in hand in the early years of the

nineteenth century, for the intellectual leaders of the Jeffersonian tradition

were steeped in eighteenth-century rationalism.  The liberal faith of the Age

of Reason was a product of a cultural evolution intimately associated with

economic and political change, on the one hand, and the great triumphs of late

seventeenth-century science on the other.  Newton was one of its heroes, and

John Locke a major prophet.  The bill of rights and the laws of celestial

mechanics are lasting monuments to its glory.  All who live in a land of free

institutions and enjoy the benefits of applied science have reason to be

grateful to the liberal leaders of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.<p>



<p>



<p>



Our gratitude cannot blind us to the fact, however, that these rationalists

greatly overestimated the role of reason in human affairs.  They were much too

optimistic in their expectation of the practical consequences which would

follow the liberation of the human mind from the tyrannies they so despised.

Can anyone doubt that if Jefferson and Franklin should return today they would

be amazed and disappointed?  Science, to be sure, has developed far beyond

their expectations; the material conquest of an untamed continent has exceeded

their wildest dreams.  But the tyrannies which control our minds remain defiant

and largely unsubdued.  We can imagine how shocked these eighteenth-century

statesmen would be to find after one hundred and fifty years the survival of

emotional reactions which they fondly supposed were founded only on ignorance

or superstition.  Inanimate nature has proved more yielding than they imagined,

human nature more stubborn and barbarous than they supposed. <p>



<p>



<p>



Today we live in a period of reaction.  The optimistic tide has ebbed.  To many

the failure of the 'war to end war' and the terrifying international scene may

be sufficient reason for discouragement.  But I believe the cause lies deeper.

Are we not to a large measure suffering from the consequences which must result

whenever human beings base their hopes on fallacious premises?  Our

intellectual ancestors were wrong on many fundamental points.  The complexities

of both the inanimate and the animate world were greater than they dreamed.

Their errors, however, in physics, chemistry, and biology do not trouble us.

The impossibility of perpetual motion, of navigation to the moon, of the

manufacture of an elixir of life, we accept as a matter of course.  But the

contrast between their hopes concerning the behavior of human beings and the

realities of the present has shattered many a modern soul.<p>



<p>



<p>



The contemporaries of Jefferson idolized freedom of the mind.  They placed one

ideal upon a pedestal and depicted a new era when humanity would bow down

before this shrine.  In so doing they passed on to their descendants a bondage

to the hopes their prophecies engendered--utopian hopes of reforming man as a

social animal.  In reality, a belief in a new form of magic came upon the

scene.  The goddess Reason was to wave a wand and all mankind would be

prosperous and at peace.  In the twentieth century we find the spell has

failed.  Or so I read the past.  And if I am right, then widespread enthusiasm

for intellectual freedom can be rekindled only when a sufficient number of men

and women readjust their expectations.  Only then will the whole country strain

to unleash once more the potentialities of the human mind.  When that time

comes a new sense of humility will reflect an altered mood.  No easy faith in

the inevitability of progress will cheer us on.  Instead, courage will flow

from a determination to face the problem of evil, not from a skill in hiding

it.<p>



<p>



<p>



Scientists appear to agree that we must now modify even those modes of thought

which concern inanimate nature. The scientific point of view of the late

nineteenth century is already out of date. This is but another step in the

progress of a healthy skepticism.  It is a recognition that we cannot settle

many questions we once thought solvable.  It is a recognition that our

scientific theories are only models--models that help us formulate those

empirical observations which we generalize into scientific laws. It may be

necessary, as in the case of light, to employ two theories which once appeared

to be mutually contradictory.  The physicist has learned to like this

situation, perhaps even to love the apparent contradiction involved in

employing a wave theory for explaining one set of optical phenomena, a

corpuscular theory for another.  Parenthetically one may remark that those who

teach the elements of the subject have not had their task made easier!<p>



<p>



<p>



The impact of these new modes of thinking about the sciences will eventually

have repercussions on all our ways of thought.  In the annual report of the

Rockefeller Foundation for 1938 the President writes as follows: 'The physical

sciences have centuries of experimentation behind them; the social sciences are

just emerging from a priori and deductive methods.  Even today a good deal that

masquerades under the name of social science is metaphysics, as obsolete in its

approach as was Francesco Sizzi's logic against Galileo's discovery of the

satellites of Jupiter.  "The satellites are invisible to the naked eye," he

said, "and therefore can have no influence on the earth, and therefore would be

useless, and therefore do not exist."  This same logical method, long outmoded

in the physical sciences, is traceable in some weighty books on economics and

political science written as late as 1938.'<p>



<p>



<p>



This statement of Dr. Raymond B. Fosdick is indicative of a new critical

approach to vital problems.  A reassessment of the realities of individual

behavior and the nature of society is in progress along several lines.  Some

look to a fruitful combination of the work of the social anthropologist and

psychologist.  Some believe that the new line of march should parallel that

followed so successfully in the development of modern experimental medicine by

clinicians.  From many quarters come reports that a new strategy is now

developing.  Once this is formulated and accepted there will be a rush of able

pioneers to exploit the field.  Confidence in our intellectual leaders will

again surge upward.  The Jeffersonian tradition will move forward; American

thought will change its orientation and American education will feel a

quickening of the pace.<p>



<p>

<p>



<p>



I venture, then, to look forward to a renaissance of the vitality of the first

element in the Jeffersonian tradition in education--freedom of the mind.  I am

equally optimistic about the second--equality of opportunity.  I plead guilty

at once to wishful thinking.  Furthermore, I admit cheerfully that I propose to

indulge in dangerous prophecy.  But can anyone discuss the future with a

neutral mind?<p>



<p>



<p>



Until fairly recently it was taken for granted that the American republic could

be described as classless.  For a century and a half Americans have been saying

with pride, 'This is a free country.  There are no classes in the United

States.'  Note these words carefully, for the denial of classes in America is

the denial of hereditary classes, not the denial of temporary groupings based

on economic differences.  'Caste' and 'class' are equated by the average

American, and I shall follow this usage.  'This is a free country.  There are

no classes in the United States.'  The number of times these two sentences have

been sincerely spoken could be recorded only by a figure of astronomical

magnitude.  Were they ever an approximately accurate description of typical

American society?  My answer would be yes.  Have they today sufficient vitality

and validity to be the basis for a continuation of Jefferson's educational

program?  A crystal gazer alone could tell.  But I think the chance is good

enough to demand our careful consideration of the possibility.  For my own

part, I risk with enthusiasm an affirmative answer and stand on the hope of our

reconstituting a free and classless nation.<p>



<p>



<p>



Phrases descriptive of a free, casteless, or classless society have not only

represented an American belief of great potency in the past, but have described

actual conditions in many sections of this republic.  As compared with the

situation in even such free countries as England and France, this country was

unique in being without hereditary classes.  The importance of this fact, I

believe, has not been fully emphasized.  But, I hasten to add, the social

changes which have altered the situation during the last fifty years have all

too often been ignored.<p>



<p>



<p>



American society in some localities has always been organized on definite class

lines; money and power have been passed on from father to son.  The different

strata have been relatively rigid and impenetrable  But until recently such

situations were the exception rather than the rule.  Now we see in progress the

rapid extension of such stratification over the whole land.  We see throughout

the country the development of a hereditary aristocracy of wealth.  The coming

of modern industrialism and the passing of the frontier with cheap lands mark

the change.  Ruthless and greedy exploitation of both natural and human

resources by a small privileged class founded on recently acquired ownership of

property has hardened the social strata and threatens to provide explosive

material beneath.<p>



<p>



<p>



Let us not shut our eyes to the realities. The vanishing of free lands, the

spread of large-scale manufacturing units, the growth of cities and their

slums, the multiplication of tenant farmers and despairing migratory laborers,

are signs of the passage from one type of social order to another. The

existence of vast unemployment only emphasizes the evil significance of an

unwelcome change. Have we reached a point where the ideal of a peculiar

American society, classless and free, must be regarded as of only historical

significance?<p>



<p>



<p>



Our friends on the Left will, I imagine, say yes. A class struggle is

inevitable, they declare. Forget the dreams of a pioneer civilization, the

early American town or farm, and face the modern capitalistic world, they urge.

From their viewpoint no discussion of present problems which refuses to fit

every fact into the framework of a class struggle can be realistic. The

extremists will add, at least to themselves, that the outcome of the struggle

is also inevitable--a classless society, not of the early American type, but on

the Russian model.<p>



<p>



<p>



On the extreme Right we may find an equally clear renunciation of the

ideal--equally clear, but not, as a rule, equally outspoken, for the underlying

assumptions here are often entirely unconscious.  Throughout the history of

this republic there has been among a small group undue admiration for the

educational system of England, a system built largely on class lines.  Among

such people Jefferson's idea of careers open to all the talented has evoked

little enthusiasm.  There has been little concern with recruiting the

professions from every economic level.  The ideal has been education of a

ruling caste rather than a selective system of training leaders.<p>



<p>



<p>



Yet the unique character of the American way of life has been repeatedly

emphasized since Jefferson's time.  Lincoln in his first message to Congress

declared that 'the leading object of the Government for those whose existence

we contend' is 'to elevate the condition of men; to lift artificial weights

from all shoulders; to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all; to afford

all an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life.' The historian,

F. J. Turner, writing at the beginning of the present century, summed up the

case as follows: 'Western democracy through the whole of its earlier period

tended to the production of a society of which the most distinctive fact was

freedom of the individual to rise under conditions of social mobility....'<p>



<p>



<p>



Let me pause a moment to examine the phrase 'social mobility,' for this is the

heart of my argument.  A high degree of social mobility is the essence of the

American ideal of a classless society.  If large numbers of young people can

develop their own capacities irrespective of the economic status of their

parents, then social mobility is high.  If, on the other hand, the future of a

young man or woman is determined almost entirely by inherited privilege or the

lack of it, social mobility is nonexistent.  You are all familiar with the old

American adage, 'Three generations from shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves.'  This

implies a high degree of social mobility, both up and down.  It implies that

sons and daughters must and can seek their own level, obtain their own economic

rewards, engage in any occupation irrespective of what their parents might have

done.<p>



<p>



<p>



Contrast this adage with a statement of the aristocratic tradition--namely,

that it takes three generations to educate a gentleman.  Fifty years ago the

contrast between these two statements would have been proclaimed by many

intelligent Americans as the epitome of the difference between the New World

and the Old.  The possibility that each generation may start life afresh and

that hard work and ability would find their just rewards was once an exciting

new doctrine.  Is it outworn?  In short, has the second component of the

Jeffersonian tradition in education still vitality?  Can a relatively high

degree of social mobility be realized in this modern world?<p>



<p>



<p>



The distinction between a stratified class system and one with a high degree of

social mobility is apparent only when at least two generations are passed in

review.  A class, as I am using the word, is perpetuated by virtue of inherited

position.  For one generation, at least and perhaps two, considerable

differences in economic status as well as extreme differentiation of employment

may exist without the formation of classes.  Uniform distribution of the

world's goods is not necessary for a classless society.  If anyone doubts this

statement, let him examine the social situation of many small communities in

different parts of this country during the early stages of their development.

Continuous perpetuation from generation to generation of even small

differences, however, soon produces class consciousness.  Extremes of wealth or

poverty accelerate the process.<p>



<p>



<p>



It is not within my province to consider what political measures should be

taken if we reject the idea of an inevitable stratification of society.  It is

not for me to say what legislation is in order if we desire to implement the

ideal of a free classless society.  My unwillingness to discuss this important

aspect of the problem is not to be taken as a measure of my dissatisfaction

with the rapidly growing social and economic differentiation of the United

States.  On the contrary, if the American ideal is not to be an illusion, the

citizens of this republic must not shrink from drastic action.  The

requirement, however, is not a radical equalization of wealth at any given

moment; it is rather a continuous process by which power and privilege may be

automatically redistributed at the end of each generation.  The aim is a more

equitable distribution of opportunity for all the children of the land.  The

reality of our national life must be made a sufficiently close approximation to

our ideal to vitalize a belief in the possibility of the envisaged goal.<p>



<p>



<p>



I am wary of definitions--even in expounding the exact sciences to an

elementary class.  It is often more profitable to explain the nature of a

concept by illustration than to attempt a definition.  Both the words 'free'

and 'classless,' as I am employing them, have a relative, not an absolute,

meaning.  They are useful, I believe, even in a rough quantitative sense, in

contrasting different types of social organizations which have existed in the

last few centuries in the Western World.  It is easy to imagine a small segment

of any country where one would be hard put to it to say whether the society in

question was free and classless, or the contrary.  To pass a judgment on larger

social units is even more difficult, but I should not hesitate to say that

Russia today is classless, but not free; England, free, but not classless;

Germany neither free nor classless.<p>



<p>



<p>



To contrast the social history of the United States and that of even so closely

related a country as Great Britain is illuminating.  If we examine, for

example, the recent history by G. D. H. Cole entitled The British Common

People, 1746-1938, we shall see portrayed the evolution of one type of

political democracy within a highly stratified caste system.  Compare this

picture with the history of the growth of this republic by expansion through

the frontier in the last one hundred years--a history in which social castes

can be ignored; a history where, by and large, opportunity awaited the able and

daring youths of each new generation.<p>



<p>



<p>



This fundamental difference between the United States and England has been

blurred by similarities in our political and legal systems and by our common

literary culture.  Failure to give due weight to the differences between a

casteless society and a stratified society has had unfortunate consequences for

our thinking.  I have already suggested that many of our friends on the Right

have had their educational views distorted by too ardent contemplation of the

English public schools (so-called) and English universities.  Similarly, I

believe that in the last few decades our friends on the left, who look towards

a collectivist society, have suffered from overexposure to British views--views

emanating in this case not from the ruling class but from the left-wing

intellectuals of the Labor party.  It seems to me that in this century, as in a

much earlier period of our history, an imported social philosophy has strongly

influenced radical thought.  I am not referring to orthodox Marxism, but rather

to the general slant of mind inevitable among English and Continental reformers

whose basis of reference is a society organized on hard-and-fast class lines.

The original American radical tradition has been given a twist by the impact of

these alien ideas.  As far as the role of government is concerned, the

political reformer has swung completely round the circle.  On this issue,

Jefferson with his almost anarchistic views would find difficulty, indeed, in

comprehending his modern political heirs.<p>



<p>



<p>



Native American radicalism has all but disappeared.  Our young people now seem

forced to choose between potential Bourbons and latent Bolsheviks.  But without

a restoration of the earlier type of radical the Jeffersonian tradition in

education will soon die.  Obviously it cannot long survive a victory of the

socialistic Left--there is no place for such ideas in a classless society on

the Russian model.  And it will likewise disappear automatically unless a high

degree of social mobility is once again restored.  To keep society fluid, the

honest and sincere radical is an all-important element.  Those in positions of

power and privilege (including college presidents) need to be under constant

vigilant scrutiny and from time to time must be the objects of attack.

Tyrannies of ownership and management spring up all too readily.  In order to

ensure that the malignant growths of the body politic will be destroyed by

radiations from the Left, much abuse of healthy and sound tissue must be

endured.  Reformers and even fanatical radicals we must have.  But if the

unique type of American society is to continue, those who would better

conditions must look in the direction of the progressive or liberal movements

of an earlier period.  The Left must consider returning to the aim of checking

tyranny and restoring social mobility.  Reformers must examine every action

lest they end by placing in power the greatest tyrant of all--organized

society.<p>

<p>



<p>



There are probably some who feel that I am indulging in nostalgic fancy when I

hope for the evolution of a less stratified and more fluid society.  You may

say that the modern world of large cities, vast industries, and scientific

methods of communication has made the America of a hundred years ago as

irrelevant as the Middle Ages.  You may argue that a way of life which was

possible in the 1840s is impossible in the 1940s; that in the near future we

shall all of us have to move in a quite contrary direction.  You may contend

that soon we shall have to take sides in a bitter class struggle and choose

between an American brand of Fascism and an American brand of Socialism.<p>



<p>



<p>



I know that many believe this to be inevitable.  I venture to disagree.  And

here is the reason for my rash dissent.  In my opinion, our newly erected

system of public education has potentialities of which we little dream.  In

this century we have erected a new type of social instrument.  Our

secondary-school system is a vast engine which we are only beginning to

understand.  We are learning only slowly how to operate it for the public good.

But I have hope that it will aid us in recapturing social flexibility, in

regaining that great gift to each succeeding generation--opportunity, a gift

that once was the promise of the frontier.<p>



<p>



<p>



Let me explain.  Today some six million boys and girls attend our secondary

schools, ten times the number enrolled a half century ago.  Today nearly three

quarters of those of high-school age are enrolled as pupils; fifty years ago

schooling at this level was a privilege of less than ten per cent of those who

might attend.  Opportunity can be evaluated only in terms of personal capacity.

What is opportunity for one young man is a blind alley for another.  In rapidly

expanding pioneer communities, openings for capabilities of all sorts

automatically appeared.  Only doctors, lawyers, and ministers needed an

extensive education.  Opportunities were ready at hand for all other types of

talent.  In our highly industrialized, relatively static society, the situation

is otherwise.  The personal problem of each boy or girl is much more difficult.

Abilities must be assessed, talents must be developed, ambitions guided.  This

is the task for our public schools.  All the future citizens pass through these

institutions.  They must be educated as members of a political democracy, but,

more important still, they must be equipped to step on to the first rung of

whatever ladder of opportunity seems most appropriate.  And an appropriate

ladder must be found for each one of a diverse groups of students.  This may

seem an overwhelming burden to put upon our educational system.  But is it not

possible that our public schools, particularly our high schools, can be

reconstructed for this specific purpose?<p>

Jefferson thought of universal schooling of younger children chiefly in terms

of educating potential voters.  His selective process for higher studies was

conceived in terms of intellectual pursuits--of preparation for the learned

professions such as law and medicine.  To continue the tradition he started, we

must expand both of his ideas today.  The roads which lead to those careers

which depend on aptitude for 'book learning' still run through the

universities.  We must fight to keep them open.  State-supported universities

have blazed the way.  But the task is far from done.  In many localities the

opportunities for the children of the really poor are lamentable indeed.

Outside of metropolitan areas and college towns, the privileges of a

professional training are hard to win.  An expanded scholarship policy in our

privately endowed universities is imperative.  Wisely administered student aid

will go far to right the balance.  Perhaps this device merits more attention

even by institutions supported by the state.<p>



<p>



<p>



The changes required to provide adequately for the intellectually gifted are

relatively slight.  The real problems of reconstruction of our schools and

colleges do not lie in this area.  The real difficulties are with the careers

of a different sort.  Our schools must be concerned not only with the able

scholar, but with the artist and the craftsman.  They must nourish those whose

eye or ear or manual dexterity is their greatest asset.  They must educate

others whose gifts lie in an ability to understand and lead their fellow men.

The school curricula must include programs for developing the capacities of

many who possess intuitive judgment on practical affairs but have little or no

aptitude for learning through the printed page.<p>



<p>



<p>



It has been a natural consequence of our history that many false values now

permeate the entire educational system.  'Book learning' is placed too high in

the scale of social ratings by some; too low by others who profess to scoff at

'brains.'  That type of ability which can handle easily the old-fashioned

subjects of the curriculum is often glorified by being equated with

intelligence' by educational snobs.  On the other hand, the same ability often

suffers from lack of stimulation when there is failure to maintain high

standards.  As a result, we have a great deal of make-believe in our schools

and colleges--too many feeble attempts at tasks which are proper only for a

restricted type of individual; too many failures to explore talents which fall

outside orthodox academic bounds.  Jefferson in the simpler society of his day

naturally thought of only a few avenues of opportunity open through education.

Today we must recognize the existence of many and strive for the social

equality of all.<p>



<p>



<p>



Parents who expect miracles worked upon their children must be reminded of the

limitations imposed by nature.  In athletics, at least, the coaches are

expected to develop only promising material.  No one complains if his

undersized son with awkward legs does not become a football hero.  Some

fathers, however, seem to demand the intellectual equivalent of such a miracle.

We expect our college health departments to direct each student into that form

of sport which is suited to his physique and power.  We need a parallel form of

educational guidance in both schools and colleges to assist the development of

the skills of brain and hands.<p>



<p>



<p>



But again I venture to be optimistic.  I see signs everywhere of enormous

strides forward in such matters.  Our educational pattern is becoming daily

more diversified; a recognition of the need for a radically different type of

education is growing.  We look forward to the opening of many channels which

lead to a variety of attractive goals; we can envisage the building up of more

than one 'elite.'<p>



<p>



<p>



Of course, in any realistic discussion of these problems we cannot neglect the

social and economic factors.  As long as the shadow of unemployment is upon the

land, some method of providing food and clothing for the children of many

families must be found.  For even free schools offer little real opportunity to

famished youngsters; public education is only theoretically available to those

in rags.  Providing food and clothing for those to whom assistance is essential

is clearly necessary for a satisfactory functioning of the entire educational

system.  Many a talented youth is lost by dropping out of the competition, for

financial reasons, during the high-school years.  In short we must explore

every method of developing the individual capacity of each future citizen for

useful labor based on individual initiative.<p>



<p>



<p>



Political and economic changes must go hand in hand with educational

innovations--the revision of methods of perpetuating control of many large

industries, the overthrow of nepotism and patronage wherever possible, the

stimulation of small enterprises, the spreading of private ownership.  All this

and more is needed if a free classless society is to become once again an ideal

which affects our lives.<p>

Freedom of the mind, social mobility through education, universal

schooling--these, let me repeat, are the three fundamentals of the Jeffersonian

tradition.  They have represented the aspirations and desires of a free people

embarked on a new experiment, the perpetuation of a casteless nation.  Popular

enthusiasm for enlightenment, for overturning dogmas, for intellectual

exploration, has temporarily waned.  I have given my reasons for hoping that

the black reaction of these years is only a passing phase.  The ideal of a free

republic without classes has likewise suffered an eclipse.  To many of the

present college generation the phrase 'equality of opportunity' seems a

mockery, a trite collection of idle words.  In this I see the major challenge

to our educational system, a challenge which can be met only by a radical

reconstruction.  If the nation wants to bend its efforts to have as free and

classless a society as possible, then for those of us concerned with schools

and colleges our course is clearly plotted.<p>



<p>



<p>



So it seems to me.  If we as educators accept the American ideal, then this

acceptance must be the major premise for all our thinking.  Without neglecting

the older roads designed for those of academic brilliance, we must construct

many new approaches to adult life, and we must do so very soon.  Extreme

differentiation of school programs seems essential--differentiation of

instruction, but not necessarily a division into separate schools.  From this

it follows that rapid improvement in our testing methods must be forthcoming; a

much more conscientious and discriminating form of educational guidance must be

developed soon if we are not to fail.  In short, a horde of heterogenous

students has descended on our secondary schools; on our ability to handle all

types intelligently depends in large measure the future of this country.<p>



<p>



<p>



Is it too late--too late for our schools to revitalize the idea of a classless

nation?  Can we complete the necessary major readjustments in our educational

system in time to prevent the extinction of the Jeffersonian tradition?  I

believe we can, if we make haste.  I predict at least another century of vigor

for the American ideal.  I envisage a further trial on this continent for many

generations of our unique type of social order.  I look forward to a future

American society in which social mobility is sufficient to keep the nation in

essence casteless--a society in which the ideals of both personal liberty and

social justice can be maintained--a society which through a system of public

education resists the distorting pressures of urbanized, industrialized life.

I have faith in the continuation of a republic composed of citizens each

prepared to shoulder the responsibility for his own destiny.  And if at each

step in the educational journey opportunity truly beckons, will not each

student rejoice in the struggle to develop his own capacities?  Will he not be

proud of the continuing American tradition and find in contemplation of our

national history ample courage to face those risks and hazards that come to all

who would be free?<p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

	

	<font size=5>C</font>ALMLY, patiently, with considerable bravery, the instructor at the shooting

range shows me how to fire the submachine gun, a <A HREF="http://www.prairienet.org/guns/arms/m10.htm">MAC-11</A>--the first real gun I

have ever held. It jams repeatedly. "That's why they call it a Jam-o-matic,"

someone says. Finally, anticlimactically, like an idiot, I am shooting up the

floor (the instructor told me to aim down). Seven or eight men standing behind

me await their turns. <p>



The fully automatic MAC-11--small, relatively lightweight, with little

recoil--is less intimidating than the semi-automatic rifles, which I can't

quite bring myself to use. I am anxious enough around the handguns. "Lean

forward," the instructor keeps telling me, while I lean back, trying to get as

far away from the gun as I can. How do thirteen-year-olds do this? I wonder,

trying not to hurt myself with a huge, heavy revolver. I jump every time a shot

is fired (and can't wait for the guys to stop playing with the machine gun). I

can barely get the slide back on one of the semi-automatic handguns. But I'm

pleased when I hit the target with the 9mm <A HREF="http://www.winternet.com/~jknoll/protector.html">Glock</A>, the only one of these guns I

can imagine being able to use. And when someone offers me a casing from the

<A HREF="http://www.hol.gr/people/sv1cec/ppks.gif">Walther PPK</A> I've just shot (James Bond's gun, everyone points out), I pocket

it.<p>



I've been invited to the shooting range to "observe and try out the right to

bear arms in action," along with about twenty other participants in a two-day

seminar on guns and the Constitution, sponsored by <A HREF="http://www.saf.org/pub/rkba/wais/data_files/aphrodite/academics">Academics for the Second

Amendment</A>. Funded partly by the <A HREF="http://www.nra.org/">National Rifle Association</A>, Academics for the

Second Amendment isn't exactly a collection of academic gun nuts--most of its

more than 500 members aren't academics, and its president, Joseph Olson, an NRA

board member and a professor at Hamline Law School, in Minnesota, seems a

rational, open-minded man. But the organization is engaged in a genteel

lobbying effort to popularize what many liberals consider the gun nut's view of

the Second Amendment: that it confers an individual right to bear arms, not

just the right to bear arms in a well-regulated militia. <p>



Since it was founded, in 1992, Academics for the Second Amendment has held four

by-invitation-only seminars for academics who share its beliefs about the

Second Amendment--or might be persuaded to adopt them. The year before last I

asked permission to attend a seminar but was turned down; last year I received

an unsolicited invitation, apparently in response to an article in which I had

questioned the effectiveness of traditional approaches to gun control. <p>



Don Kates, who is a San Francisco lawyer, a gun aficionado, and the author of

numerous articles on guns and the Constitution, leads the seminar

energetically, taking only a little time out to show us pictures of his parrot.

His approach is scattershot, or spray and pray. Ranging over legal, moral, and

practical arguments for private gun ownership, he discusses self-defense and

the deterrent effect of an armed citizenry; the correlation between guns and

crime; difficulties of enforcing gun controls; bigotry against gun owners; and,

finally, constitutional rights. Comments by participants are sometimes sensible

and occasionally insane: one man proclaims that mothers should give guns to

children who attend dangerous public schools.<p>



"What would you do if you had a fourteen-year-old kid who felt he needed a gun

for self-defense?" he asks me repeatedly.<p>



"I'd take him out of school before giving him a gun."<p>



But even among gun advocates there is relatively little support for the rights

of juveniles to own guns, or opposition to bans on juvenile ownership.

Opposition to gun prohibitions focuses on attempts to disarm more or less sane,

law-abiding adults, who are deemed to be endowed with both natural and

constitutional rights to self-defense against criminals and despots.<p>



Like moral and legal claims about gun owners' rights, the practical

consequences of widespread gun ownership are highly debatable. No one can say

with any certainty whether it increases violence or decreases crime. Don Kates

speculates that magically reducing the approximately 200 million firearms in

circulation to five million would have virtually no reductive effect on the

crime rate: according to a 1983 National Institute of Justice-funded study by

James D. Wright, Peter H. Rossi, and Kathleen Daly, about one percent of

privately owned firearms are involved in criminal activity, suggesting that

eliminating 99 percent of the nation's guns would not ameliorate crime. Or

would it? <A HREF="http://www.econ.duke.edu/Econ/Faculty/Users/pcook.html">Philip Cook, an economist at Duke University</A> and a leading researcher

on gun violence, considers Kates's speculation about the uselessness of

reducing the number of guns "patently absurd."We can't predict which guns will

be used in crimes, he says, even if a relatively small number are used

feloniously overall. Reducing the availability of guns would raise their price

and therefore reduce their accessibility, to adult felons as well as juveniles.

And even if a drastic reduction in the number of guns wouldn't necessarily

decrease crime, it would decrease fatalities. Guns are particularly lethal,

Cook has stressed: the "fraction of serious gun assaults that result in the

victim's death is much higher than that of assaults with other weapons." Since

not all gun homicides reflect a clearly formulated intent to kill, Cook

reasons, access to guns can increase the lethality of assaults. A decrease in

the use of guns, however, might lead to an increase in nonfatal injuries.

Robberies committed with guns tend to involve less violence than other

robberies because the victims are less likely to resist. (Cook speculates that

victims who do resist robbers armed with guns are more likely to be killed.)<p>



Debates about gun ownership and gun control are driven more by values and

ideology than by pragmatism--and hardly at all by the existing empirical

research, which is complex and inconclusive. Wright, Rossi, and Daly reported

that there is not even any "suggestive evidence" showing that "gun ownership .

. . as a whole is, per se, an important cause of criminal violence." The

evidence that guns deter criminal violence is equally insubstantial, they

added, as is evidence that additional gun controls would reduce crime. Many are

already in place and rarely, if ever, enforced; or they make no sense. In 1983

Wright, Rossi, and Daly concluded that the "benefits of stricter gun controls .

. . are at best uncertain, and at worst close to nil."<p>



As for legal debates about the existence of constitutional rights, empirical

data is irrelevant, or at best peripheral. But the paucity of proof that gun

controls lessen crime is particularly galling to people who believe that they

have a fundamental right to bear arms. In theory, at least, we restrict

constitutional rights only when the costs of exercising them seem unbearably

high. In fact we argue continually about what those costs are: Does violence in

the media cause violence in real life? Did the release of the Pentagon Papers

endanger the national security? Does hate speech constitute discrimination? In

the debate about firearms, however, we can't even agree on the principles that

should govern restrictions on guns, because we can't agree about the right to

own them.<p>



How could we, given the importance of the competing values at stake--public

safety and the right of self-defense--and the opacity of the constitutional

text? The awkwardly drafted Second Amendment doesn't quite make itself clear:

"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the

right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." Is the

reference to a militia a limitation on the right to bear arms or merely an

explanation of an armed citizenry's role in a government by consent? There is

little dispute that one purpose of the Second Amendment was to ensure that the

people would be able to resist a central government should it ever devolve into

despotism. But there is little agreement about what that capacity for

resistance was meant to entail--armed citizens acting under the auspices of

state militias or armed citizens able to organize and act on their own. And

there is virtually no consensus about the constitutional right to own a gun in

the interests of individual self-defense against crime, rather than communal

defense against tyranny. Is defense of the state, and of the common good, the

<i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the Second Amendment or merely one use of 

it?<p> 



<font size=5>T</font>HE Supreme Court has never answered these fundamental questions about the

constitutional uses of guns. <A HREF="http://www.shadeslanding.com/firearms/fedcases.2nd.html">It has paid scant attention to the Second

Amendment, providing little guidance in the gun-control debate</A>. Two frequently

cited late-nineteenth-century cases relating to the Second Amendment were more

about federalism than about the right to bear arms. 

<i><A HREF="http://www.saf.org/pub/rkba/wais/data_files/nra/courts/94-12-08_federal_cases_regarding_second_amendment">Presser</i> v.

<i>Illinois</a></i>, decided in 1886, involved a challenge to a state law

prohibiting private citizens from organizing their own military units and

parades. The Court held that the Second Amendment was a limitation on federal,

not state, power, reflecting the prevailing view (now discredited) that the

Bill of Rights in general applied only to the federal government, not to the

states. (A hundred years ago the Court did not apply the First Amendment to the

states either.) <i>Presser</i> followed 

<i><a href= "http://www.saf.org/pub/rkba/wais/data_files

/nra/courts/94-12-08_federal_cases_regarding_second_amendment">U.S. </i>v. <i>

Cruikshank</a></i>, which

held that the federal government could not protect people from private

infringement of their rights to assemble and bear arms. <i>Cruikshank</i>,

decided in 1876, invalidated the federal convictions of participants in the

lynching of two black men. This ruling, essentially concerned with limiting

federal police power, is virtually irrelevant to Second Amendment debates

today, although it has been cited to support the proposition that an oppressed

minority has a compelling need (or a natural right) to bear arms in

self-defense.<p>



The most significant Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment was

<i><a href= "http://www.saf.org/pub/rkba/wais/data_files

/nra/courts/94-12-08_federal_cases_regarding_second_amendment">U.S.</i> v. 

<i>Miller </i>(1939)</A>, a less-than-definitive holding now cited

approvingly by both sides in the gun-control debate. <i>Miller</i> involved a

prosecution under the 1934 National Firearms Act. Jack Miller and his

accomplice had been convicted of transporting an unregistered shotgun of less

than regulation length across state lines. In striking down their Second

Amendment claim and upholding their conviction, the Court noted that no

evidence had been presented that a shotgun was in fact a militia weapon,

providing no factual basis for a Second Amendment claim. This ruling implies

that the Second Amendment could protect the right to bear arms suitable for a

militia.<p>



Advocates of gun control or prohibition like the Miller case because it makes

the right to bear arms dependent on at least the possibility of service in a

militia. They cite the Court's declaration that the Second Amendment was

obviously intended to "assure the continuation and render possible the

effectiveness" of state militias; they place less emphasis on the Court's

apparent willingness to permit private citizens to possess military weapons.

Citing <i>Miller</i>, a dealer at a gun show told me that the Second Amendment

protects the ownership of only such devices as machine guns, Stingers, and

grenade throwers. But advocates of gun ownership don't generally emphasize this

awkward implication of <i>U.S.</i> v. <i>Miller</i> any more than their

opponents do: it could lead to prohibitions on handguns. They like the

<i>Miller</i> decision because it delves into the history of the Second

Amendment and stresses that for the framers, the militia "comprised all males

physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense."<p>



This view of the militia as an inchoate citizens' army, not a standing body of

professionals, is central to the claim that the Second Amendment protects the

rights of individual civilians, not simply the right of states to organize and

arm militias. And, in fact, fear and loathing of standing armies did underlie

the Second Amendment, which was at least partly intended to ensure that states

would be able to call up citizens in defense against a tyrannical central

government. (Like the Bill of Rights in general, the Second Amendment was

partly a response to concerns about federal abuses of power.) James Madison,

the author of the Second Amendment, invoked in <i><A HREF="http://www.shadeslanding.com/firearms/federalist.html">The Federalist Papers</A> </i>the

potential force of a citizen militia as a guarantee against a federal military

coup.

<blockquote>

Let a regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and

let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government: still it would

not be going too far to say that the State governments with the people on their

side would be able to repel the danger. . . . To [the regular army] would be

opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in

their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their

common liberties and united and conducted by governments possessing their

affection and confidence. It may well be doubted whether a militia thus

circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops.

Those who are best acquainted with the late successful resistance of this

country against the British arms will be most inclined to deny the possibility

of it. Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over

the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate

governments, to which the people are attached and by which the militia officers

are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more

insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit 

of.</blockquote><p>





This passage is enthusiastically cited by advocates of the right to bear arms,

because it supports their notion of the militia as the body of people,

privately armed; but it's also cited by their opponents, because it suggests

that the militia is activated and "conducted" by the states, and it stresses

that citizens are "attached" to their local governments. The militia envisioned

by Madison is not simply a "collection of unorganized, privately armed

citizens," Dennis Henigan, a handgun-control advocate, has argued. <p>



That Madison's reflections on the militia and the Supreme Court's holding in

<i>U.S.</i> v. <i>Miller</i> can be cited with some accuracy by both sides in

the debate testifies to the hybrid nature of Second Amendment rights. The

Second Amendment presumes (as did the framers) that private citizens will

possess private arms; Madison referred offhandedly to "the advantage of being

armed, which the Americans possess." But Madison also implied that the right to

bear arms is based in the obligation of citizens to band together as a militia

to defend the common good, as opposed to the prerogative of citizens to take up

arms individually in pursuit of self-interest and happiness.<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE tension at the heart of the Second Amendment, which makes it so difficult

to construe, is the tension between republicanism and liberal individualism.

(To put it very simply, republicanism calls for the subordination of individual

interests to the public good; liberalism focuses on protecting individuals

against popular conceptions of the good.) A growing body of scholarly

literature on the Second Amendment locates the right to bear arms in republican

theories of governance. <A HREF="http://www.rru.com/~jds/politics/rkba/embar.html">In a 1989 article in the <i>Yale Law Journal</i> that

helped animate the Second Amendment debate</A>, the University of Texas law

professor Sanford Levinson argued that the Second Amendment confers an

individual right to bear arms so that, in the republican tradition, armed

citizens might rise up against an oppressive state. Wendy Brown, a professor of

women's studies at the University of California at Santa Cruz, and David C.

Williams, a law professor at Cornell University, have questioned the validity

of a republican right to bear arms in a society that lacks the republican

virtue of being willing to put communal interests first. Pro-gun activists

don't generally acknowledge the challenge posed by republicanism to the

individualist culture that many gun owners inhabit. They embrace republican

justifications for gun ownership, stressing the use of arms in defending the

community, at the same time that they stress the importance of guns in

protecting individual autonomy.<p>



Advocates of the right to bear arms often insist that the Second Amendment is

rooted in both collective and individual rights of self-defense--against

political oppression and crime--without recognizing how those rights conflict.

The republican right to resist oppression is the right of the majority, or the

people, not the right of a small religious cult in Waco, Texas, or of a few

survivalist tax protesters in Idaho. The members of these groups have

individual rights against the government, state and federal. (Both the <A HREF="http://ds.internic.net/cgi-bin/enthtml/legal/aclu-gopher.b">American

Civil Liberties Union</A> and the NRA protested the government's actions in Waco

and its attack on the survivalist Randy Weaver and his family.) But refuseniks

and refugees from society are not republicans. They do not constitute the

citizen militia envisioned by the framers, any more than they stand for the

American community; indeed, they stand against it--withdrawing from the body

politic, asserting their rights to alienation and anomie or membership in

exclusionary alternative communities of their own. Republicanism can't

logically be invoked in the service of libertarianism. It elevates civic virtue

over individualism, consensus over dissent. <p>



Nor can social-contract theory be readily invoked in support of a right to arm

yourself in a war against street crime, despite the claims of some

gun-ownership advocates. The right or power to engage in punishment or

retribution is precisely what is given up when you enter an ordered civil

society. The loss of self-help remedies is the price of the social contract.

"God hath certainly appointed Government to restrain the partiality and

violence of Men," 

<A HREF="http://swift.eng.ox.ac.uk/jdr/locke.html">John Locke</A> wrote. A person may always defend his or her life

when threatened, but only when there is no chance to appeal to the law. If a

man points his sword at me and demands my purse, Locke explained, I may kill

him. But if he steals my purse by stealth and then raises a sword to defend it,

I may not use force to get it back. "My Life not being in danger, I may have

the <i>benefit of appealing</i> to the Law, and have Reparation for my 100

<i>l.</i> that way." <p>



Locke was drawing a line between self-defense and vigilantism which many gun

owners would no doubt respect. Others would point to the inability of the

criminal-justice system to avenge crimes and provide reparation to victims, and

thus they would assert a right to engage in self-help. Social-contract theory,

however, might suggest that if the government is no longer able to provide

order, or justice, the remedy is not vigilantism but revolution; the utter

failure of law enforcement is a fundamental breach of trust. And, in fact,

there are large pockets of disaffected citizens who do not trust the government

to protect them or to provide impartial justice, and who might be persuaded to

rise up against it, as evidenced by the disorder that followed the 1992

acquittal of police officers who assaulted Rodney King. Was Los Angeles the

scene of a riot or of an uprising? <p>



Injustice, and the sense of oppression it spawns, are often matters of

perspective--particularly today, when claims of political victimization abound

and there is little consensus on the demands of public welfare. We use the term

"oppression" promiscuously, to describe any instance of discrimination. In this

climate of grievance and hyperbole, many acts of violence are politicized. How

do we decide whether an insurrection is just? Don Kates observes that the

Second Amendment doesn't exactly confer the right to resist. He says, "It gives

you a right to win."<p>



The prospect of armed resistance, however, is probably irrelevant to much

public support for gun ownership, which reflects a fear of crime more than a

fear or loathing of government. People don't buy guns in order to overthrow or

even to thwart the government; in the belief that the police can't protect

them, people buy guns to protect themselves and their families. Recognizing

this, the NRA appeals to fear of crime, particularly crime against women.

("Choose to refuse to be a victim," NRA ads proclaim, showing a woman and her

daughter alone in a desolate parking lot at night.) And it has countered

demands for tougher gun controls not with radical individualist appeals for

insurrection but with statist appeals for tougher anti-crime laws, notably

stringent mandatory-minimum sentences and parole reform. There is considerable

precedent for the NRA's appeal to state authority: founded after the Civil War,

with the mission of teaching soldiers to shoot straight, in its early years the

NRA was closely tied to the military and dependent on government largesse;

until recently it drew considerable moral support from the police. Today,

however, statist anti-crime campaigns are mainly matters of politics for the

NRA and for gun advocates in general; laws mandating tough sentences for the

criminal use of firearms defuse demands for firearm controls. Personal

liberty--meaning the liberty to own guns and use them against the government if

necessary--is these people's passion. <p>



Gun advocates are apt to be extravagantly libertarian when the right to own

guns is at stake. At heart many are insurrectionists--at least, they need to

feel prepared. Nothing arouses their anger more, I've found, than challenges to

the belief that private gun ownership is an essential check on political

oppression.

<p>

 

<font size=5>D</font>URING the two-day seminar held by Academics for the Second Amendment, we argue

equanimously about nearly everything--crime control, constitutional rights, and

the fairness and feasibility of gun controls--until I question whether, 200

years after the Revolution, citizens armed with rifles and handguns can

effectively resist the federal government. I ask, If Nixon had staged a

military coup in 1974--assuming he had military support--instead of resigning

the presidency, could the NRA and the nation's unaffiliated gun owners have

stopped him? For the first time in two days Don Kates flares up in anger, and

the room is incandescent.<p>



"Give me one example from history of a successful government oppression of an

armed populace," he demands. The FBI raid on David Koresh's compound in Waco,

Texas, doesn't count, he says, because Koresh's group was a small, isolated

minority. The Civil War doesn't count either. (I can't remember why.) Neither

do uprisings in Malaysia and the Philippines. <p>



People like me think it is possible to oppose the government only with nuclear

weapons, Kates rages, because we're stupid; we don't understand military

strategy and the effectiveness of guerrilla warfare, and we underestimate the

hesitancy of troops to engage their fellow citizens in armed conflict. Millions

of Americans armed only with pistols and long guns could turn a bloodless coup

into a prolonged civil war. <p>



Perhaps. I am almost persuaded that Kates might have a point, until he brings

up the Holocaust.<p>



Gun advocates sometimes point out that the Holocaust was preceded by

gun-control laws that disarmed the Jews and made it easy to round them up. (In

a 1994 article in <i>Guns and Ammo</i>, Jay Simkin, the president of <A HREF="http://www.public.asu.edu/~brickner/rkba/jpfo.html">Jews for

the Preservation of Firearms Ownership</A>, argued that gun control causes

genocide. Simkin wrote that today "genocides can be prevented if civilians

worldwide own military-type rifles and plenty of ammunition.") Kates doesn't go

nearly this far, but he does point out that genocides are difficult to predict.

At the turn of the century, he says, I would not have predicted the Holocaust,

and today I can't predict what holocausts may occur in the next fifteen or

fifty years. I give up. "If millions are slaughtered in the next fifty years

because of gun-control laws," I declare, "let their deaths be on my head."<p>



"It's very interesting that you say that," Kates concludes, a bit

triumphantly.<p>



Kates apologizes later for his outburst, and in a subsequent phone conversation

he acknowledges that "the Holocaust was not an event where guns would have

mattered; the force was overwhelming." But he adds that guns might have

mattered to individual Jews who could have saved themselves had they been

armed, even if the Jewish community couldn't have saved itself collectively.

And guns might matter to a Croatian woman who shoots a Serbian soldier breaking

into her house, he suggests; if there were a Second Amendment in Bosnia, it

would protect her.<p>



Zealots in the pro-gun camp (Kates is not among them) seem to identify with the

woman defending her home to the extent that they fear attack by the federal

government. "Using a national epidemic of crime and violence as their

justification, media pundits and collectivist politicians are aggressively

campaigning to disarm private citizens and strengthen federal law enforcement

powers," proclaims a special edition of <i>The New American</i>, a magazine on

sale at gun shows. After gun control, the editors suggest, the greatest threat

to individual liberty is the Clinton plan for providing local police

departments with federal assistance. "Is it possible that some of those who are

advocating a disarmed populace and a centralized police system have

totalitarian designs in mind? It is worth noting that this is exactly what

happened in many countries during this century."<p>



This can be dismissed as ravings on the fringe, but it captures in crazed form

the hostility toward a powerful central government which inspired the adoption

of the Second Amendment right to bear arms 200 years ago and fuels support for

it today. Advocates of First Amendment rights, who believe firmly that free

speech is both a moral imperative and an instrument of democratic governance,

should understand the passion of Second Amendment claims. <p>



They should be sympathetic as well to the more dispassionate constitutional

arguments of gun owners. Civil libertarians who believe that the Bill of Rights

in general protects individuals have a hard time explaining why the Second

Amendment protects only groups. They have a hard time reconciling their

opposition to prohibitions of problematic behavior, such as drug abuse, with

their support for the prohibition of guns. (Liberals tend to demonize guns and

gun owners the way conservatives tend to demonize drugs and pornography and the

people who use them.) In asserting that the Second Amendment provides no

individual right to bear arms or that the right provided is anachronistic and

not worth its cost, civil libertarians place themselves in the awkward position

of denying the existence of a constitutional right because they don't value its

exercise.<p>



The civil-libertarian principles at issue in the gun debate are made clear by the

arguments of First Amendment and Second Amendment advocates, which are

strikingly similar--as are the arguments their opponents use. Pornography

rapes, some feminists say. Words oppress, according to advocates of censoring

hate speech. "Words Kill," declared a Planned Parenthood ad following the

abortion-clinic shootings in Brookline, Massachusetts, last year. And all you

can say in response is "Words don't kill people; people kill people." To an

anti-libertarian, the literature sold at gun shows may seem as dangerous as the

guns; at a recent gun show I bought Incendiaries, an army manual on

unconventional warfare; Exotic Weapons: An Access Book; Gunrunning for Fun and

Profit; and Vigilante Handbook, which tells me how to harass, torture, and

assassinate people. Should any of this material be censored? If it were, it

would be sold on the black market; and the remedy for bad speech is good

speech, First Amendment devotees point out. According to Second Amendment

supporters, gun-control laws affect only law-abiding gun owners, and the best

defense against armed criminals is armed victims; the remedy for the bad use of

guns in violent crime is the good use of guns in self-defense.<p> 



Of course, guns do seem a bit more dangerous than books, and apart from a few

anti-pornography feminists, most of us would rather be accosted by a man with a

video than a man with a gun. But none of our constitutional rights are

absolute. Recognizing that the Second Amendment confers an individual right to

bear arms would not immunize guns from regulation; it would require that the

government establish a necessity, not just a desire, to regulate. The majority

of gun owners, Don Kates suggests, would be amenable to gun controls, such as

waiting periods and even licensing and training requirements, if they didn't

perceive them as preludes to prohibition. The irony of the Second Amendment

debate is that acknowledging an individual right to bear arms might facilitate

gun control more than denying it ever could.<p>



But it will not facilitate civic engagement or the community that Americans are

exhorted to seek. The civil-libertarian defense of Second Amendment rights is

not a republican one. It does not derive the individual right to bear arms from

republican notions of the militia; instead it relies on traditional liberal

views of personal autonomy. It is a communitarian nightmare. If the war against

crime has replaced the Cold War in popular culture, a private storehouse of

guns has replaced the fallout shelter in the psyche of Americans who feel

besieged. Increasingly barricaded, mistrustful of their neighbors, they've

sacrificed virtue to fear.

<blockquote>

	<i><font size=4>Philosopher and our leading

political analyst, WALTER LIPPMAN has had from the first serious reservations

about the containment policy as it was applied by Secretary of State Dean

Acheson and then by Secretary Dulles. In this paper Mr. Lippmann examines the

thesis which was put forth by George Kennan in his Reith Lectures over BBC, an

argument which has had a far-reaching effect throughout Western Europe and

particularly in West Germany.</i></font><p>

	

	

	<pre>

	

	</pre>

	

	<font size=5>G</font>eorge Kennan has told us that when he was writing the Reith Lectures during

the summer of 1957, he was "happily ignorant" of the "attention they would

attract." This is, surely, a simple statement of fact. For nobody, I think,

could have foreseen that throughout the world they would precipitate a public

debate which has so many of the characteristics of an historic event.<p>



<p>



Yet now that the debate has begun, we can, I think, see why it began when it

did. Mr. Kennan delivered his lectures in the interval between the launching of

the Sputnik in October and the Special meeting of the NATO powers in Paris on

December 16. During that time, there had occurred in the world, and

particularly in Germany and Western Europe, a profound reappraisal of the

balance of military power.<p>



<p>



The basic assumption of the post-war policies of the Western allies has been

that the United States is the paramount power in the world, and that in the

long run, the views of the Western allies on Germany and Eastern Europe are

bound to prevail. As a result of the disclosures about the Soviet's

technological capabilities, which the Sputnik symbolized, this basic assumption

has been destroyed. In the reappraisal which is now under way, it is widely

agreed that for an indefinite number of years to come, the United States and

its allies in NATO will be hard put to it to restore and to maintain an equal

balance of power.<p>



<p>



It was at the beginning of this reappraisal that Mr. Kennan spoke out. He spoke

gently and quietly, as it is in his nature to do. But because nobody in

authority, not Mr. Dulles, not Dr. Adenauer, not Mr. Macmillan, had anything at

all to say on the political implications of the great disclosures about the

balance of power, Mr. Kennan's words have resounded and reverberated throughout

the world.<p>



<p>



But while this explains why his lectures attracted so much attention when they

did, there is still the question of why they have attracted so much support. My

own view is that the Western allies had come to a dead end on the road which

they had been following in the post-war years. The road which Mr. Kennan

pointed out is the only alternative which has some promise of leading to the

reunification of Germany and to the national independence of the East European

states.<p>



<p>



These are, I know, large words. I can explain them best if we look back to the

origin of the controversy which Mr. Kennan's lectures have brought to a head.

For Mr. Kennan's central thesis has a long history. I think I can speak with

some personal knowledge when I say that the fundamental issue--which is

withdrawal from Germany versus occupation--was already being debated in high

Allied quarters by the summer of 1943; that is to say, a good eighteen months

before the end of World War II.<p>



<p>



At that time the German armies were still in Russia, around Leningrad and

Smolensk, and the Red Army had just reoccupied Kiev. The Western Allies were

not yet on the European continent except in Italy south of Cassino. Yet

Churchill and Roosevelt had become confident of a victory over Germany, and it

had become plain to them that they would need an overall plan of how the Soviet

Army coming from the East and the Allies coming from the West should deal with

a defeated Germany.<p>



<p>



This led them to decide, at the Moscow Conference in November, 1943, to

establish a European Advisory Commission with instructions to study post-war

political problems and to make recommendations. This commission set to work in

London early in 1944, and brought forth agreed recommendations on the terms of

surrender, on the allotment to the four powers of zones of occupation, and on

machinery for the joint control of occupied Germany.<p>



<p>



But before the commission was set up, during the summer and early autumn of

1943, there was private discussion among the Allied planners and policy makers

on a critical point of principle. Reflecting this discussion, I wrote a

newspaper column on October 5, 1943, saying that we must think about "whether,

and if yes, then for how long a time and in what way, the Allies mean to occupy

and govern Germany with their armies. Disarmament, the pursuit of war

criminals, the liquidation of the Nazi Party and of German economic

imperialism, reparations--will have to be enforced. *The question is whether it

is desirable and necessary to enforce our terms by occupying and governing

Germany.*"<p>



<p>



The Allies decided, of course, to occupy and govern Germany, and in the heat of

war it may be that this was the unavoidable decision. But in the light of what

has happened since--namely that the prolonged occupation of Germany has led to

the division of Germany and of Central Europe--it is interesting to note that

even as early as 1943 there were responsible and informed men who would have

preferred to take a different course.<p>



<p>



I do not know whether the official archives contain documentary evidence of

this. But I was, at the time, a practicing newspaperman who often had the

privilege of talking privately with some of the planners, and what I am quoting

was written at the time: "it is evident...that to occupy and govern as big a

nation as Germany is a most formidable undertaking, and to carry it out for a

long period of years by the united action of our complicated alliance would

call for a degree of unanimity which we have no right to count upon."<p>



<p>



The alternative to a prolonged occupation, which was suggested by the

dissenters, was to have the Allied armies enter Germany "for the purpose of

disarming her, of arresting the criminals, of recovering the loot, and of

making visible the reality of her defeat, and then to retire outside the

frontiers, except perhaps to hold the strategic gateways and certain strategic

economic resources such as the Ruhr and Silesia."<p>



<p>



The main argument advanced for this alternative was that it would make the

German people themselves, rather than the puppet governments of the Allied

occupation, responsible for the solution of the German problem. There was the

greatest doubt as to whether the Soviet Union would ever make a German

settlement if the Red Army established itself in Germany. It is interesting to

read today that fifteen years ago--when the war against Germany had still to be

won, before there was a Cold War with the Soviet Union--it was possible to see

that if Europe got used to a prolonged Allied occupation, "as soon as the

occupying powers leave, all of Europe will tremble at what may happen, and the

whole artificial settlement will be in turmoil ten or fifteen years hence."

Fifteen years have now passed, and Mr. Kennan's suggestion that the occupation

must somehow, sometime, be brought to an end is causing many Europeans and

Americans to tremble.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



This shows, I submit, that Mr. Kennan's central thesis is not a newfangled

theory, the pipe dream of a mystic, the imagining of an unworldly scholar, or

worse still, the design of an appeaser of communism. Mr. Kennan's central idea

points to the other road which the Allies might have chosen at the defeat of

Germany, had they not been in the grip of a war psychosis and, we may add, had

they been lucid and realistic about Stalin.<p>



<p>



For while it is not certain, indeed it is not probable, that the Red Army would

quickly have withdrawn from the Eastern Zone, the Western allies would have

entered the Cold War, which was unavoidable, in much the stronger political

position. The United States, with its monopoly of the atom bomb and its

unsurpassed industrial establishments was at the zenith of its military power.

The Western allies would have had a diplomatic position in which they stood for

the essence of a true peace, which is that the defeated country is not to be

partitioned and that its territory is not for long to be occupied by foreign

armies.<p>



<p>



As it is, having opted for an indefinite military occupation, we have confirmed

and consolidated all the things that we complain about: the Iron Curtain, the

partition of Germany, and the satellite empire which lies behind the lines of

the Red armies of occupation. The overriding fact about the post-war world is

that Europe remains divided along the line of demarcation where the invading

armies halted and became armies of occupation. While these foreign armies

remain where they are, there can be no reunification of Germany. Nor can the

captive nations of Eastern Europe recover their freedom while they are

surrounded by the Red Army with its outposts in Eastern Germany and its lines

of communication running through Eastern Europe.<p>



<p>



It is, therefore, facing both ways to advocate the reunification of Germany

and, at the same time, to oppose the evacuation of German territory. Moreover,

as Hungary demonstrated so vividly and so painfully, it is a cruel deception to

talk of the liberation of the captive peoples unless there is a serious

prospect of the withdrawal of the Red Army from the territory of these captive

peoples.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The European policy of the Western allies was laid down by President Truman and

Secretary Acheson. It has been continued and confirmed by President Eisenhower

and Secretary Dulles. It is based on what, from the point of view of power

politics, is a sheer paradox. The policy attempts to combine advocacy of

unification and liberation with a stern opposition to military evacuation. The

cook has promised to make an omelet but he has sworn not to break any eggs.<p>



<p>



The defenders of the existing policy consider themselves great realists who

have put aside all wishful thinking. On what calculation, then, in the power

relationships of great states, do they lease their expectation that Russia will

withdraw from Europe while the United States and Great Britain remain, and are

allowed to advance their military frontiers at least to the borders of

Poland?<p>



<p>



Because this is such an extraordinarily naive notion of what can be asked of

and gotten from the Soviet Union, there is a widespread belief in Europe that

all the official talk about liberation and unification is insincere.

Undoubtedly there is much insincerity in it. In Bonn, in London, in Paris, and

in Washington there have long been leading persons who, when they are speaking

privately, say quite frankly that they prefer a divided and occupied Germany to

a reunited and unoccupied Germany. They are afraid that a united and unoccupied

Germany will dominate Europe. They are afraid that a united and unoccupied

Germany will make a deal with the Soviet Union. They are afraid that if there

is no occupation there will be civil war in Germany. I have at many times heard

these fears argued earnestly, but privately, in each of the Western capitals.<p>



<p>



Yet I do not think that the Western policy on liberation and unification is

entirely insincere. Once upon a time, at least, it was quite sincere. It rested

originally on an estimate of the Soviet position, on what was once, as he has

recently reminded us, the estimate of Mr. Kennan himself. The Soviet Union, it

was thought, was headed for great internal trouble and would, therefore, be a

declining power in the world.<p>



<p>



I can remember an interview I had in 1953 with the head of a Western

government, who told me that there was reason to believe, based on the most

reliable intelligence, that the Soviet Union would be in a major economic

crisis by the year 1957. Mr. Dulles is on public record as believing as

recently as February 24, 1956, that such a crisis was actually under way.<p>



<p>



The existing official Western policy on unification and liberation today is

intelligible only if we recognize the premise on which it is based. That

premise is that the Western power is paramount and that the Soviet power is

certain to decline. On this premise, but only on this premise, can one arrive

at the official policy which expects Russia to withdraw while the Western

powers advance; which expects; in short, that the relative power of the two

alliances is such that in Europe the Soviet Union will be compelled to make an

unconditional surrender.<p>



<p>



We are living in a time when the underlying premise of our post-war policy has

been shown to be false. There can be no such thing as an accurate quantitative

measure of the balance of power. But whatever the actual balance may be, it is

certain beyond all doubt that the Western allies are not now superior and

all-compelling. There is, moreover, no prospect whatever that the time is

coming when they will be able to compel the Soviet Union to accept their

official terms of settlement. This is the situation from which truly realistic

thinking must start. The situation calls for a reappraisal of the official

terms of settlement, and the attention which Mr. Kennan's lectures have

attracted may be said to mark the beginning of that reappraisal.<p>



<p>



Mr. Kennan has made it plain that the last thing he meant to do in his lectures

was to recommend his "reflections to governments as a finished program for

action. What I have tried to suggest here is not what governments should do,

but what they should think about." This, I believe, he has accomplished. He has

set in motion a reappraisal of the post-war situation which has grown out of

the original decision, made during World War II, to occupy and govern a

defeated Germany. The great public, especially in Germany, which he has

attracted is aware that the Acheson-Dulles-Adenauer policy is at a dead end,

and that it has become necessary for the Western allies to reorient themselves

from a policy based on a military occupation to a policy directed toward

military disengagement.<p>



<p>



As Mr. Kennan disclaims having proposed a finished program for the governments

to act upon, it is not necessary to agree with everything he said if one agrees

with his central thesis. I myself, for example, agree with Sir John Slessor's

criticism that the "weakest point" in Mr. Kennan's lectures was where he

proposed that a reunited and neutral Germany should remain disarmed not only in

nuclear weapons but even in the conventional weapons, except those appropriate

to a kind of militia equipped to wage guerrilla war. There are, it seems to me,

other highly debatable obiter dicta in the lectures--as, for example, his

advice to continental Western Europe to renounce all nuclear weapons, and his

assertion that rich nations, like the United States, need not feel any

responsibility for the underdeveloped nations.<p>



<p>



These dicta are, however, beside the main point, and whether they are true or

false, wise or unwise, has nothing to do with the central question. It is

whether the right road is toward disengagement of the foreign armies or toward

the solidification of the existing military division of the European continent.

As compared with the central issue of occupation versus disengagement, to make

much of the other dicta is, as the saying goes, to pick fleas out of the mane

of a lion.<p>



<p>



What matters, what calls for thorough examination and debate, is that Mr.

Kennan has defined an issue which the world must face now that the post-war era

is ending and the post-Sputnik era has begun.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



As an old believer in Mr. Kennan's side of the argument, I have often been

asked several questions. The first is what our program of action would be if

disengagement became the principle of our policy. The second is whether the

West can be defended if Germany is neutral and the foreign troops leave. The

third question is whether the Russians can be expected to agree to any program

of disengagement which protects the vital interests of the West.<p>



<p>



On the first question, I have come to believe that it is too soon to adopt a

program of action. Before that can be done wisely and well the re-orientation

of our thinking must go much further. It must reach the point where it is the

accepted and common view of the preponderant mass of the Western people. A

sound program will require the collaboration of the very best minds in the

Western world. That will not be possible unless they have become convinced of

the principle.<p>



<p>



For it is of critical importance that the German parties should not be so

fiercely divided as they now are on the principle of a united, neutral, and

unoccupied Germany. If the principle is to work well, it is an absolute

necessity that German neutrality should--like Swedish neutrality, for

example--rest on the united will of the people. In a European settlement, the

Germans must not have any reason to feel that they have been abandoned by their

friends or that they have been imposed upon by their conquerors.<p>



<p>



The Germans are not now united in their convictions about their own future, and

it will take time before they can be expected to agree among themselves. There

is no rush about the actual settlement, which in any event would almost

certainly have to be phased over a period of years. What is needed for the

moral and mental health of the world is that there should be clear signs that

among the Germans and the Western powers the process of reappraisal,

reorientation, and re-education is gaining momentum.<p>



<p>



The second question is whether Western Europe and North America can be defended

if the foreign armies are withdrawn from a united Germany with the Red Army

going behind the Russian frontier of 1945, the British and American armies

withdrawing from continental Europe. For my part, I assume in this that a

reunited and neutral Germany will be an armed power, as Sweden is, and that the

Strategic Air bases in England, in Spain, and in North Africa will remain where

they are--pending a more general global settlement.<p>



<p>



For the answer to this question, I am relying upon the judgment of Marshal of

the Royal Air Force Sir John Slessor, who, as was demonstrated during the war

and after, is a military strategist of the first order.<p>



<p>



In a series of articles appearing recently in the New York Herald Tribune,

Slessor argues that the defense of Europe in this age of long-range nuclear

weapons does not require the stationing of non-European troops on the Continent

nor the establishment of nuclear weapons in Central Europe. In fact, he

believes that the withdrawal of Anglo-American-Soviet forces from the Continent

(and of Germany from the NATO alliance), far from being an unacceptable act of

appeasement, might well be considered by Russia as a concession "which actually

leaves the West no less militarily effective than it is now."<p>



<p>



He goes on to say:<p>



<p>



"It would be foolish to pretend there are no risks about this--of course there

are serious risks; this whole situation is a balance of risks. But let us look

at it in the round. Would the danger from 500 Russian submarines be any more

menacing if there were not still a few British and American divisions in

Germany? Does any one really imagine that twenty-eight NATO divisions with

atomic weapons could stop an invasion by the 150 Russian divisions armed with

the same weapons? Can any one believe that in that almost inconceivable event

the nuclear holocaust could be avoided, whether Allied divisions are on German

soil or not?<p>



<p>



"That perhaps is a bit over-simplified. But the point surely is this: the

political advantages of this broad belt of uncommitted states between East and

West, once firmly established, would surely outweigh some admitted political

disadvantages....<p>



<p>



"I'd have thought on balance the political advantages would be

overwhelming--including the obvious one that to separate in this way the

military frontiers of East and West would reduce the chances of an accidental

stumble into a war that nobody wants. That means that the military dangers

involved in the process of establishing this new political pattern in Europe

(which must take some years) must be serious indeed to outweigh its political

advantages once it is established."<p>



<p>



Sir John Slessor's conclusion is, of course, debatable and it is strongly

opposed by the leading strategists of NATO. But on the military issues he

speaks, I believe, with expertness and authority fully equal to theirs. His

conclusion is that on balance the probable advantages of disengagement outweigh

the military risks.<p>



<p>



This brings us to the third question, which is whether the Soviet Union will

agree to an acceptable settlement which has such political advantages for the

West. The answer must be, it seems to me, that our primary task is to work out

a policy which reflects the true condition of the balance of power. It must

recognize, in short, that *we are dealing with an equal power, not an inferior

one*, and that a settlement must therefore be based on bargaining.<p>



<p>



Such a settlement must be designed not only to protect our own vital interests.

It must respect the vital interests of Russia.<p>



<p>



We do not have to prove to ourselves now that the Soviet Union will be moderate

and reasonable in the negotiations. All that we have to do, and all that we can

do, is to work out a program of settlement which a Russian government could

find acceptable if that government were moderate and reasonable, if it were

protecting its vital interests but not seeking aggressively to dominate

Europe.<p>



<p>



All this will not be easy to do. But if such a program is ever arrived at, it

will be based, I believe, on the principle of disengagement.

<blockquote>

	<i><font size=4>The press is increasingly becoming the arbiter of

American life--and the values of the media are not always the values of the

society they serve.</i></font><p>

	

	

	<pre>

	

	</pre>

	

	<font size=5>V</font>iewers who chanced to switch to Washington's channel 4 (WRC-TV) on the evening

of March 28, 1979, found themselves looking down the barrel of an ordinary

hand-held hair dryer. "This is not a gun, and it doesn't shoot bullets," said

the voice-over. "But what comes out can be just as deadly." The program was the

result of nine months' investigation by WRC's "Consumer Action" team, and for

the extraordinary span of nearly twenty minutes ("without commercial

interruption"), it developed a case that Americans were in considerable peril

because many hand-held hair dryers were spewing fibers from asbestos

insulation. Making the connection between the ingestion of asbestos fibers and

the death rates from various forms of lung cancer, investigator Lea Thompson

said gravely, "How many of those [deaths] can be attributed to hair dryers

...no one knows."<p>



<p>



By consumerist standards, the program was a stunning success. Such companies as

Hamilton Beach, General Electric, Norelco, Sears, Penney's, and Montgomery

Ward, all named as culprits, were besieged by angry customers. Gillette and

American Electric, which had long used mica instead of asbestos for insulation,

were exonerated on the program, but besieged nonetheless. The Consumer Products

Safety Commission, a federal agency, was stung into confusion and open

hearings, subsequently forcing a voluntary recall of asbestos-insulated dryers.

A Senate consumer subcommittee opened hearings and called Ms. Thompson as a

star witness.<p>



<p>



By media standards as well, the program scored high. Reversing the usual

practice, print media "picked up" the expose from a local television station

and gave it wide coverage. The UPI accounts were reprinted in hundreds of

newspapers. Channel 4 being an NBC affiliate, the story made the NBC evening

news. It was subsequently featured on both NBC's Today show and ABC's Good

Morning America. (One manufacturer feared that his business would be destroyed

just by David Hartman's silent scowl of disapproval as he looked at a hand-held

dryer; it wasn't.) The WRC investigation team won the George Polk Award for

Distinguished Journalism. And the "genuine coup" was eulogized in a two-page

essay in People, which revealed what the TV camera had not: that Lea Thompson,

the daughter of a journalist and a University of Wisconsin graduate in

journalism and marketing, was eight and a half months pregnant at the time of

the story.<p>



<p>



The strong combination of action pictures, whirring motors, stern interviews,

and authoritative explanations certainly alerted millions of Americans in

record time to the asbestos fiber problem. But the consumerist consequences, as

important as they were, can be seen as part of a much larger societal point. We

are rapidly approaching a situation in which reporting is the arbiter of other

institutions in American life; in this microcosmic case we see and hear it

imposing its own values, standards, and priorities with irresistible impact on

agencies of both government and business.<p>



<p>



The point is made more broadly when we review the principal categories of news

coverage over the past decade. The media--and particularly television--take

credit for turning the public against the Vietnam War ("the living room war")

and forcing its termination. "Watergate was the greatest journalistic triumph

of the twentieth century," wrote one correspondent for Columbia University's

"Survey of Broadcast Journalism," and unrelenting media attention certainly

prompted the politics that forced President Nixon's resignation. Journalistic

coverage was a prime mover in forcing government agencies and boards of

directors to ventilate a series of corporate scandals in the mid-1970s, the

most notable investigations of which led to the dismissal of top management at

the 3M Corporation and the Gulf Oil Company, and eventually to anti-bribery

legislation. The emergence of President Sadat of Egypt as a folk hero and the

constant television posturing of the principals in the Iranian hostage crisis

suggest that we have, through media coverage, carried foreign policy into a

period of "mass diplomacy," as Flora Lewis of the New York Times describes

it.<p>



<p>



One can pursue the point through the agenda of quality-of-life issues:

consumerism, dating back to the elevation of Ralph Nader to national

prominence; ecology and environmentalism, ranging from the effect of supersonic

transports on the ionosphere to the greenhouse effect to acid rain; energy

concerns, from off-shore oil spills to the hazards of coal and nuclear power;

safety in the workplace, with latter-day attention to potential carcinogens;

toxicity, from Kepone to Love Canal.<p>



<p>



Such is merely the stuff of news, one might argue. And to a degree this is

true. But to another degree these areas represent coverage by selection, which

suggests an imposition of media values and standards in contrast, perhaps, to

the values and standards of other institutions. In writing The Brethren, their

gossipy best seller on the disrobed U.S. Supreme Court, Bob Woodward and Scott

Armstrong noted proudly in a preface that they had breached "the authority,

traditions and protocols" of the Court to subject it to journalistic inspection

for the first time. Some critics doubted that this inspection did much for the

set of values involved in the American system of justice.<p>



<p>



It is becoming clear that the increasingly pervasive power of the media is

central to the development of most other American institutions. We are, in

fact, becoming what might be called a "newsocracy." The technology and

substance of today's newscasting combine for an impact greater than that of any

other informational force in the history of democratic societies--redirecting

even the traditional processes of politics. This is a matter of social

consequence, because some aspects of media value judgment might be perceived as

being at odds with the general welfare. Accordingly, I would argue that

affected "others" (e.g. government agencies, educational institutions, and

publicly held corporations) have both a right and a duty to enter the

informational competition. This contention should not be interpreted as a

challenge to press freedom; rather it is an acceptance of today's news coverage

for what it is, and an attempt to broaden its intellectual vision in the

interests of the society that the First Amendment serves.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



In my view, media dominance has been powerfully abetted by two major trends of

the past decade. One is a widening perception of the interaction of one kind of

endeavor upon another in the postindustrial society. To a certain extent this

integrative process has always been manifested in political reform movements,

but it gained a kind of personal relevance in the so-called youth movement of

the late sixties and early seventies. It has, loosely, been called "holism."

The second is a spreading of public awareness, the sense of direct

participation in events, which has loosely been described as "populism." These

two trends, combined with video technology, have stepped up the power of

journalistic influence.<p>



<p>



Recently MIT's Technology Review gathered a group of the nation's top science

writers from print and television to talk about "Science, Technology and the

Press." Science is their beat, but as they contrasted the simpler days of

"happy talk" reporting with the multidimensional demands of today's

assignments, they could be speaking for almost any group of earnest

journalistic specialists. David Perlman of the San Francisco Chronicle saw

science reporting broadening into "the politics of science or public affairs

emerging from science." Mark Dowie of Mother Jones spoke of the reader's desire

to know about "the interface between science and technology and even more,

about the interface between technology and the corporate world because...that's

where science ceases to be apolitical." Cristine Russell of the Washington Star

confessed that "coverage of recombinant DNA, for example, was always 'biased'

toward its possible impact on the public and not toward special interests--be

they science or the government, or whatever." This group, gathered soon after

Three Mile Island, was properly humble about the responsibilities involved in

the widening media function, yet, by implication, quite confident that nobody

else could perform it as well. (As a reflection of this attitude, the cover of

Technology Review pictured a youthful reporter opening his shirt to show a

Superman emblem across his chest.)<p>



<p>



But if interrelatedness has inspired complex reportorial judgments, populism

inspires a broad simplicity--or a low common denominator. Network news not only

has usurped the role of the newspaper as the principal source of information,

but has constantly increased the number of people who make news-watching part

of their lives. For example, ABC-TV, proud of its recent high news ratings,

believes that its audience is drawn mostly from people who never before watched

TV news regularly. "I don't think there's any doubt that we've created a

heightened consciousness of the news," says a vice president of research. Also,

there is no doubt that of the three networks, ABC has the most kinetic and

visually stimulating and the least mentally taxing news format.<p>



<p>



Nobody is more aware than the network professionals of the

lowest-common-denominator aspect of their work. Four years ago, Walter Cronkite

expressed concern to the Radio and Television News Directors' Association: "We

fall far short of presenting all, or even a goodly part, of the news each day

that a citizen would need to intelligently exercise his franchise in this

democracy. So as he depends more and more on us, presumably the depth of

knowledge of the average man diminishes. This clearly can lead to a disaster in

a democracy."<p>



<p>



"Disaster" may be too strong a word, but TV news does seem to be changing some

meanings of democracy by offering a simplistic kind of interrelatedness. For

example, one consequence has been the translation of hitherto abstract or

impersonal subjects into people, places, and crises. The administration of

justice becomes the judge, the lawyer, or the criminal (and his family). The

presidency is words, facial expressions, today's necktie, and Amy and Rosalynn

in the background. The political convention is almost a plaything of television

personalities. A plant closing is people wondering aloud what they will do

next--and a congressman sympathizing. A gasoline shortage is angry customers

and angry service station operators damning the oil companies--and a

congressman sympathizing. A nuclear power accident is pregnant women in

tears--and nervous officials trying to cope with a backwash of emotion as well

as with unknowns of physics.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



In their embrace of holism the media--already under pressure to produce

specialists in such areas as science, finance, energy, and business--play an

interdisciplinary role. To do so, the "supermen" who take this role seriously

apply themselves to continuous learning. Yet we see some television journalism

that could lead a long way toward Cronkite's "disaster."<p>



<p>



Electronic journalism can claim antecedents in the rich history of radio

reporting during and after World War II, and many of the leading figures of

television news, including Cronkite, have struggled to keep alive that

heritage. But TV news is also the bastard child of the entertainment industry.

All commercial media contract in one way or another to deliver a certain

audience to advertisers, but in the case of the three major networks,

variations in audience size, as measured by the ratings, represent millions of

dollars in advertising revenue. That fact is reflected in news selectivity, and

leads to an image of the world projected daily, competitively, and with

striking homogeneity on the evening news.<p>



<p>



Since network news was, by definition, confined to national news (so as not to

transgress the domain of a network's local TV affiliates), cameras focused on a

minimal number of recognizable characters from Washington and New York; the

more they could be translated into villains or heroes, the easier the

journalistic assignment and the higher the audience attention. The visual

nature of the medium put a premium on color, movement, excitement, sensation,

novelty. There has always lurked in modern journalism the knowledge that bad

news sells better than good. Witness the proliferation of the "question mark"

headline, which suggests a threat to mankind on a speculative basis. Under

competitive pressures, this stress on anxiety and negativism came to prominence

in television.<p>



<p>



Attitudinal researchers have wondered for some time about survey results that

showed a discrepancy between the average citizen's dim view of government,

business, education, etc., and his/her relative satisfaction with the company

that he/she works for, the way local government functions, the schools the kids

go to. Assessing the data for the 1970s, Everett Carll Ladd Jr. and Seymour

Martin Lipset concluded: "To some considerable degree this contradiction may

reflect the difference between the steady dose of disasters which people get

from television, and their personal experiences."<p>



<p>



It is not difficult to project such rogue trends into a gloomy prospect.

"Disaster" would not be far if the nation came to see itself primarily through

the lenses of critics with an addiction to novelty or blood and guts, and no

responsibility for consequences. Not only would the democratic process suffer

from a diminished "depth of knowledge," as Cronkite has it, but something vital

could be lost if responsible leaders of other institutions were regularly

consumed by the "bite 'em off, chew 'em up, spit 'em out" habits of television

news.<p>

Some critics think they see this approach already manifest in the techniques of

60 Minutes, designed to provide the controversy which keeps that weekly

"newsmagazine" at the top of the Nielsen ratings. In 1979 the Illinois Power

Company of Decatur allowed 60 Minutes access to the construction site of its

nuclear power plant at Clinton to film a segment on escalating nuclear

construction costs. Illinois Power's one condition was that it be allowed to

put its own cameras alongside those of 60 Minutes to film everything seen and

said in the interviews. The broadcast 60 Minutes segment, in fact, found

Illinois Power guilty of mismanagement of the power project. But by playing its

version of what was said and explained, spliced with excerpts from the 60

Minutes telecast, Illinois Power made a persuasive case for having been the

victim of dramatic and serious distortion.<p>



<p>



This and similar examples raise the question of whether, in TV's stress on

"populism," corporations exist primarily to provide a ready source of "heavies"

in the manufactured dramas that hold those customers and those Nielsen

ratings.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Media judgments, of course, do not occur in a vacuum. As Illinois Power found

out, the media's stories powerfully affect the "others" who are the objects of

their attention, and their composite story defines the society for millions of

people. The principal problem in a newsocracy is that there is, at the moment,

no force to offset the net range and impact of today's informational

technology. Since the constructive and the exploitative forces of journalism

are constantly in tension, with no certainty about the outcome, it behooves

other affected institutions to recognize the problem and accept the fact that

they, too, have a stake in the battle.<p>



<p>



The beginning of such counterstrategy is the realization that the "others" have

allies within the media. Professional journalists can recognize the short-term,

audience-grabbing excesses and know that the long-term test is credibility. One

catches the essence of embattled professionalism in a credo voiced by David

Perlman during that Technology Review forum on science-related reporting.<p>



<p>



"There are some things," he said, "that we can properly do....We can look for

self-serving statements. We can expose biases that exist. We can expose lies;

scientists lie occasionally, like everybody else, and they're going to lie

publicly at times. So that's our job. It's not to say whether nuclear power is

bad or good. Present the debate and be very careful about ascribing expertise

to those who are experts."<p>



<p>



Professionalism is at work in the development of such thoughtful interpreters

of science as Perlman and his colleagues, and in the training of specialists in

business and economic affairs as well. As generations change, more and more

business and economic news is being handled by editors and reporters who are

educated in business practice, rather than by "general assignment" people. This

new sophistication is evident in many regional newspapers, whose healthy

intellectual diversity is thinning out the New York- and Washington-centered

judgments of the national media. Even the TV networks are learning to give more

discretion to their economics editors, who, while constrained to simplisms by

time limitations on camera, can sometimes moderate the more sensationalist

anti-business onslaughts of their general-assignment colleagues.<p>



<p>



The first step for "others," then, is to support and encourage media

professionals by providing them with information that makes them better able to

report factually and to perform the demanding integrative function. But there

is more to it than that. All affected institutions must realize that a

newsocracy is a different kind of environment, and that they must engage with

that environment in a different way. Perhaps the media's concern with

interrelatedness provides a clue. If a firm can come to think of itself not

only in economic terms but as a unit in a network of social and political

values, then it need have no unreasonable fears about explaining itself to

media that seek to understand just those relationships. This requires, first,

that a company learn to see and feel itself in the consciousness of its

particular publics and infuse that sense of public-relatedness into every level

of its operations.<p>



<p>



For example, the Mobil Corporation's controversial "op-ed" advocacy campaign,

which has been a fixture on the editorial pages of influential newspapers, was

developed as a result of Mobil's analysis of the political and social prospects

for the company and the oil industry. "We decided more than ten years ago that

our problem was literally one of survival in a hostile external climate; it was

more political than economic," says Herbert Schmertz, Mobil's vice president

for corporate affairs and the principal architect of the campaign. "We decided

to enter the argument through the media and thus put our case before people

whose opinions count." Not everybody likes Mobil's abrasive style--which on

occasion has drawn the wrath of the President of the United States--but critics

would be hard put to deny that Mobil's editorial insistence has brought new

facts to the public debate on energy, and in the process has influenced

editorial thought and political action.<p>



<p>



Exxon and Shell, affronted by charges of duplicity in an NBC-TV series in late

1979, eschewed flamboyant counterpunches and took their respective cases to the

National News Council. In both situations the council examined the facts and

came down hard against NBC, agreeing in the Exxon case that the telecast

contained "factual error, the selective use of information, lack of

perspective, and the building of effect through innuendo."<p>



<p>



The reaction of the Gillette Company in the hand-held hair dryer expose

reflects a more positive, and perhaps more internal, kind of operational

public-relatedness. Out of its tradition of precise quality control of razor

blades, Gillette long ago gave consumer concern high priority and set up a

medical test laboratory for all its products. In 1964, the company named Robert

Giovacchini, a Ph.D. in medical science, head of the lab; ten years later, he

was made vice president for product integrity and given final review of the

medical safety of new products and of marketing and advertising claims relating

to medical safety. In addition, his group performs a quality review of new and

existing products. In 1973 he directed a redesign for the hand-held hair dryers

that substituted mica for asbestos as an insulator, even though asbestos

particle emissions from Gillette dryers averaged only 5 percent of the maximum

allowable under OSHA standards.<p>



<p>



Of all the major hair dryer companies, only Gillette offered to help the

producers of the WRC-TV program. David Fausch, vice president of corporate

public relations and a former Business Week editor, argued internally that the

story would be told more accurately if Gillette supplied accurate data. It

helped, of course, that Gillette was "clean." It helped, too, that in return

the program's producers warned in advance of the screening so that Gillette

could alert its sales force and its merchandisers to possible trouble. In the

fallout, Gillette did not escape damage--and did not really expect to. The

relevant point is that the company's operations had long since been sensitive

to public concerns, and it could move smoothly into a media spotlight with a

clear understanding of its own objectives, and without fear that the world

would end if it did not win all the points in the telecast.<p>



<p>



Such an approach, in my view, is far more sophisticated than conventional

public relations. It is corporate acceptance of the same long-term values that

concern the responsible media, and it reflects the First Amendment premise that

everybody benefits when the terms of the debate are broadened. The media, after

all, live on information, and "others" can influence the outcome by providing

accurate material. It is a corollary, of course, that "others" have a right to

keep at arm's length media agents who have a record of distorting facts to fit

preconceived notions of high drama. Journalists and their organizations have

unforgiving memories for those who put out misleading or dishonest information,

and corporate public relations departments practice a similar form of

"redlining." One of the favorite topics when people from those departments

gather for a friendly drink is "what to do when Mike Wallace calls."<p>



<p>



Should corporations and the "others" resort to end runs around the media to get

their stories out? Mobil and Illinois Power suggest varieties of end runs: one

through advocacy advertising, and the other through countervideo. In 1978 the

Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, validated the right of the First National

Bank of Boston to advertise in opposition to an income tax referendum in

Massachusetts (First National Bank v. Belotti). In some quarters this and other

related court decisions were perceived as unleashing the mighty economic power

of big corporations to influence public opinion unfairly. In fact, in writing

for the minority, Justice Byron White saw the majority opinion as opening the

door to corporate domination of "not only the economy, but also the very heart

of our democracy, the electoral process." But Justice Lewis Powell, Jr., for

the majority, said, "The inherent worth of the speech in terms of its capacity

for informing the public does not depend upon the identity of its source,

whether corporation, association, union or individual." And Chief Justice

Warren Burger, in a separate opinion, added that "media conglomerates" pose "a

much more realistic threat to valid [political] interests" than other

corporations.<p>



<p>



In the context of my argument, the issue is one not of unleashing corporate

power but rather of prodding media power to think in broader social terms. In a

newsocracy, the media's implicit role is to translate the values of our

conventional morality--what we really want for ourselves and our world--to the

institutions that make it operate. Those institutions, in turn, must be heard

and understood before judgment is passed. Conceivably, such media power could

lead toward "disaster" if it adheres to a Nielsen-rating value system.

Conceivably, though--and I prefer this view--it could prompt a higher order of

intellectual performance from all components of the society, and especially

from the professionals who tell us every day in every way what our world means.

Ultimately it might even help a confused society to define its values more

clearly.

	<font size=5>I</font>n the last ten years great changes have taken place in the course of study
required of boys in preparation for Harvard College. The present list of
requirements was published in the College Catalogue for 1886-87, after much
discussion in the college and outside of it. The main point of dispute was the
compulsory study of Greek. The opponents of Greek attacked it as being of no
practical value to any person who was not to become either a student of
language or a teacher, and argued, from this point of view, that it was absurd
to require all boys to study it. Many other persons, trained under the old
system, could not conceive of a liberally educated man to whom Greek was but a
name, and therefore defended the requirement. The college authorities have
settled the question for a time by admitting pupils with no knowledge of Greek,
but only under very stringent conditions.<p>

<p>

<p>

This is a wide departure from traditional standards, but the college has made
other changes even more far-reaching in their results than this. Changes in the
form of examination set by the college in many of the old subjects of study
have altered the whole course of preparation in them. These great changes have
been so slow and gradual that the general public has almost no knowledge of
them, and even many of the preparatory schools have no adequate appreciation of
them. Nevertheless, parents with sons to be fitted for college, and all persons
interested in education, ought to understand the present requirements in order
to see the general tendency and the purpose of them. It is well worth while,
also, to consider whether they make a good foundation for a liberal education
before other changes are suggested.<p>

<p>

<p>

The studies required for admission are divided into two classes, elementary and
advanced. The first class is prescribed for all students except under two
conditions, which will be mentioned later, while the second class is elective.
Without going into troublesome details, it may be said that the examinations in
the elementary studies test the following acquirements: an elementary working
knowledge of four languages, two ancient, Latin and Greek, and two modern,
French and German; some acquaintance with English classical literature, and the
ability to write clearly and intelligently about the books which have been
read; a knowledge of elementary algebra and plane geometry; an acquaintance
with the laws and phenomena of physics obtained from experiments performed by
the pupil in a laboratory, or a knowledge of descriptive physics and elementary
astronomy; and last, a knowledge of the history and geography either of ancient
Greece and Rome or modern England and America. In addition to examinations in
these prescribed elementary studies the candidate must be examined on two more
subjects, chosen, according to his tastes and natural aptitude, from the
following list of nine advanced studies:--<p>

<p>

     Latin Translation.<p>

<p>

     Greek Translation.<p>

<p>

     Latin and Greek Composition.<p>

<p>

     French.<p>

<p>

     German.<p>

<p>

     Trigonometry and Solid Geometry, or Trigonometry and Analytical Geometry.
<p>

<p>

     Advanced Algebra and Analytical Geometry<p>

<p>

     Physics<p>

<p>

     Chemistry<p>

<p>

Although the college, by implication, if not by actual words, recommends the
above course of study as the best, she permits two deviations from it.
Candidates are allowed to substitute one additional advanced study for either
French or German, and also to substitute two additional advanced studies for
either Latin or Greek; but in that case the subjects chosen must be either
mathematics alone or mathematics and natural science.  The permission to make
these two alterations in the recommended course of study is wise, and reasons
for it, I think, are not difficult to find. It is clear that the study of both
the modern languages is considered necessary to a liberal education, because
the candidate who offers only one of them for admission is obliged to study the
other during his first year in college. But as many schools in the past have
been very deficient in good teaching of the modern languages, and some would
still find it hard to teach both French and German, it is very probably that
the college does not wish to demand more than they can do. The second
permission is the one which has caused so much discussion, and has made many
persons think that Harvard has lowered her standard; in other words, has made
it easier to enter her doors. Any one, however, who examines carefully the
subjects which must be substituted for the omitted ancient language will see
that only those minds which are especially adapted to the study of mathematics
and natural science can possibly master them. It seems very wise to permit boys
with such minds to devote their time to mathematics and science for which they
have a natural bent, and drop the study of language to which they are not
suited, provided they do not lose entirely the peculiar training to the mind
which is given only by classical study. Under the present requirement, they
will obtain this from the one ancient language, which must be retained under
any and all circumstances.<p>

<p>

<p>

Let us examine these studies in detail, and notice what changes have been made
in the methods of examination in them, in order to see and understand the new
methods of instruction which are required to meet the new tests.  In the
elementary examination in the classics, the test applied is the translation at
sight of passages from Caesar and Nepos in Latin, and from Xenophon in Greek.
These authors all have a simple narrative style, and their thought is neither
involved nor profound, so that their works are entirely within the
comprehension of the average boy. Such a test as this requires an entire change
from traditional methods of classical teaching, but unfortunately many persons
do not understand just what this change is. Formerly the candidate was asked to
show that he had read certain specified works by translating passages from
them, and to show his knowledge of some standard Latin or Greek grammar by
explaining the grammatical construction of certain words in these passages. To
be able to do this the pupil stored in his memory a translation of passages
from the books he had himself read or had heard some one else read. Unless he
had a natural fondness for language, he read these passages as combinations of
words, for each of which he had to have some English equivalent word, but
rarely realized, or cared to realize, the thought which was meant to be
conveyed by them. He was taught to pick out his Latin or Greek works by means
of their English equivalents in an English order; that is, first the subject,
then the verb, and last the object, each with its modifiers. He then studied
these English words in the English order to make something out of them which,
according to his English notions, made sense. His thoughts and conceptions were
only his own English ones. He was made to learn all the rules of syntax before
he did any reading, because he must explain each construction he met by making
it fit under one of these rules. This whole system of teaching looked at the
classics only from an English point of view. The student gained very little
more than a confused knowledge of the arbitrary names which grammarians have
given to Latin and Greek constructions, and some insight into ancient life and
customs, which would have been clearer and would have been obtained more easily
if he had read any good translation of his author. He did not learn to read the
languages, nor realize that thoughts were expressed by them. Now the college
requires him to be so familiar with the vocabulary and forms of thought of the
classics that he can read a passage he has never seen before, in which the
style is not different from that to which he is accustomed, and the thought not
more profound than it is in the books which he has read. In order to do this at
all, the pupil must read each sentence as he reads and English or French one;
that is, he must take in the ideas in the order in which they are presented in
the Latin or Greek sentence. He must learn how a Roman or a Greek thought, to
be able to grasp the new thoughts which may be presented to him in a new
passage. He must get at the ideas expressed by his author before he attempts to
translate; that is, before he puts these ideas into good English. The new
system of teaching, if it would meet the new test, must keep these two
processes--the understanding of the Latin or Greek thought, and the expression
of it in English translation--entirely distinct, because the student can arrive
at the ideas in a passage he has never seen only through the language in which
they are found; whereas, under the old system, the two were confused, and the
tendency of the teaching, as we have seen, was to make him translate before he
had a clear understanding of the thought. The student must look at the
different constructions of the language as ways of conveying thoughts, and be
asked to explain the thought which is contained in them rather than to give
some arbitrary rules of syntax for them which he often does not understand. In
order to read the thought, he must be familiar with the syntax; but he gets
this familiarity by reading, as the physicist, by observing phenomena in his
laboratory, arrives at the knowledge of nature's laws. This new method of
teaching gives, as it were, a laboratory training in language. The aim is now,
not to read a certain quantity of Latin an Greek, but to learn how to read
these languages, and to make the student realize that, although the languages
are dead, they were and are still vehicles of thought.<p>

<p>

<p>

Reading with this aim is what the phrase "reading at sight" really means. In
many schools this is too little understood. It is supposed to mean guessing at
words to save the use of a dictionary, while in reality the dictionary has to
be used much more thoughtfully than before, as the boy must learn what each
word meant to a Roman or a Greek and not simply find some English word for it
which will fit into his preconceived notion of what the sentence means. Pupils
are too frequently allowed to pass over forms in a slipshod way without
learning them. Experience with pupils in preparation for college has shown me
that an exact knowledge of the forms is absolutely essential in order to see at
a glance the relations between words, and so to grasp the thought which is
expressed by them. Such exact knowledge of the forms can be got only by
memorizing them.<p>

<p>

<p>

This method of studying the classics brings out clearly their educational
value. The conceptions of Latin and Greek and the forms of expression are so
different from the student's own that he must analyze words, phrases, and
sentences containing complex ideas to arrive at any real comprehension of the
author's meaning. Being thus obliged to look at each thought from two points of
view, the Latin or Greek and the English, he is forced to get a clearer
conception of the thought than he could possibly get by looking at it from the
English side only. As few words in two widely different languages have exactly
corresponding conceptions behind them,--that is, are synonyms,--he must get at
these conceptions to see what a sentence really means. He must think, and think
clearly. He grows accustomed to clear thinking, and therefore expresses his own
thoughts more clearly both in speech and in writing. From this kind of
classical training, as from mathematics, he learns to reason logically, but
with this fundamental difference: in mathematics he reasons from letters and
figures representing quantity, and from this limitation in the symbols he
receives broad conceptions. Something of this mental training was got under the
old system of classical teaching, but the college examination did not then test
this power of thinking as the present one does. A pupil cannot translate a
passage he has never seen before without this power. To read at sight, a
student must have a large vocabulary of Latin or Greek words, of which each
word represents to him not one English equivalent word, but an idea. Under the
old system of examination this vocabulary was not necessary, because he had
read the passages before, and could often remember the context without knowing
the meaning of separate words. This vocabulary will always be a valuable
possession to him, when we consider that a large part of our English vocabulary
is derived from Latin and Greek, so that a perfectly intelligent use of English
words is impossible without some knowledge of these languages. This system of
teaching the classics is for these reasons practical, and this study of them is
as valuable to the business man as to the college professor.<p>

<p>

<p>

The desire to banish all studies which are not to be of immediate money value
to the student, which has given rise to the discussion of the comparative
usefulness of ancient and modern languages, has caused many persons to overlook
the true value of a right study of Latin and Greek. The study of them is
valuable to every man for the mental training which they give much more than
for the knowledge of ancient life and literature which is obtained through
them. This knowledge can be and often is obtained by reading English
translations of the classics, and modern works on ancient art, life, and
literature; but his training can be got only by the study of the languages
themselves. The man who says his Greek or Latin is of no use to him in business
or elsewhere does not realize that if he really studied either language his
powers of thinking were increased, even though he has forgotten every fact
learned about the language itself. <p>

<p>

The modern language requirement is the ability to read ordinary French and
German prose at sight. This requirement is the same as the classical one, and
demands the same kind of teaching. But as these languages have always been
studied from a practical point of view rather than that of the grammarian,
there has had to be no change in methods of study. No arguments are heard
against these languages on the score of uselessness, but, on the contrary, it
is sometimes claimed that the purpose of classical study, which I have spoken
of above, is entirely fulfilled by them. This is only partially true. The
student of elementary French and German does get some training of the kind I
have mentioned, but he gets much less of it. These languages are so little
different from English in forms of thought that he can arrive at the ideas
expressed in them with very little careful thinking. The new point of view from
which he looks at each thought is so nearly the same as his own English one
that he gets no clearer conceptions. The ideas represented by French and German
words are not sufficiently different from those presented to him by English
words to make him do much analytical thinking. Hence French and German are
easier to learn to read than Latin and Greek, and the unconscious training
which the mind receives is proportionately less, although the knowledge of them
is of enormous practical value.<p>

<p>

<p>

The training in mathematics which is tested by the college examination of
to-day, and really secured in the best schools, is almost as different from the
old as the new classical training is different from the old. To be prepared for
the old system of examination, the pupil had to know a certain number of
problems or propositions. He was very sure to meet enough of these old friends
on the examination paper to pass creditably, even if he had only memorized
them, without really understanding the reasoning of them. Now the candidate
must go to Cambridge so trained in algebraic analysis and geometrical reasoning
that he can reason out the problems which are given him with intelligence and
accuracy, even though, as is extremely likely, he has never seen one of them
before. No amount of cramming can enable him to do this. He is no longer
examined as to his memory of certain proofs and solutions, but as to his
ability to use the training his mind has received from these proofs and
solutions. To meet this requirement he must have received a training in exact
reasoning which will help him all his life.<p>

<p>

<p>

The change in the physics requirement has been more radical than that in any
other subject. Such a change in a comparatively new branch of human study is,
however, not so remarkable as are the changes in other branches which the world
has studied from the same point of view for ages, and in which the methods of
study had become stereotyped and fossilized. For years the college required
only such a memory knowledge of physical laws and phenomena as could be got
from a descriptive textbook. In schools where there was money at command the
study of the textbook was accompanied by illustrative experiments shown to the
pupil, but under the best of circumstances the pupil's thinking was largely
done for him. By this method of teaching, as by the old classical training, his
memory was loaded with facts of which he might or might not have any real
understanding, while he did very little real thinking. So marked was this
attitude of the college toward physics that for years, at the examination in
that subject, the candidate was asked which of the textbooks recommended by the
college he had studied, and he was given a paper of questions prepared from
that very book. Hence any boy could be sure of knowing the correct answers to
these questions, if he had learned the text of his book by heart, and had never
exercised his powers of thinking. This was a system of teaching hardly
calculated to train his mind, or to awaken an interest in a branch of science
in which the nineteenth century is doing its most active thinking and producing
its greatest results.<p>

<p>

<p>

How different is the present attitude of the college! It now publishes a
descriptive list of forty experiments, covering the elementary principles of
mechanics, sound, light, heat and electricity. These, so far as possible, are
quantitative experiments; that is, they require careful measurements from which
the laws and principles of physics can be reasoned out. Where, for any reason,
such measurements are impossible, the experiments are merely illustrative; but
even from these the pupil must reason carefully to arrive at the principles
which they illustrate. The pupil must perform these experiments himself in a
laboratory, under the supervision of a teacher. He must keep a record of all
his observations and measurements, together with the conclusions which he draws
from them. The laboratory book in which this record is kept, bearing the
certificate of his instructor, must be presented for critical examination when
he comes to Cambridge. In addition to this, he is tested by a written paper and
by a laboratory examination.<p>

<p>

<p>

This very complete form of examination, although it takes a long time, really
tests the candidate's knowledge of physics, his skill in experimenting, and his
power of reasoning. It is very unfortunate that the time devoted to the
mathematical examinations is too short to make the tests as fair as this. One
hour is all that is allowed for each of the mathematical examinations. The
result of this is that the pupil is asked to do more thinking than he can do in
the time allowed, or the ground covered by the examination is so small that the
examiner cannot estimate the candidate's knowledge and ability accurately.<p>

<p>

<p>

In the laboratory study of physics the pupil learns fewer facts, perhaps, than
he did in the textbook study, but each fact is impressed upon his mind with the
additional force of personal discovery; just as we all have a deeper impression
of a fact which we have discovered for ourselves than we have of one which is
told us by others, or of which we read. He learns to observe and make an
intelligent record of what he sees, and, what is most important, he learns to
reason from these observations to the broad generalizations which are called
physical laws. Such a course of study as this, under a good teacher, is
certainly practical. The pupil's mind must be trained, and his interest
awakened by it.<p>

<p>

<p>

Unfortunately, the expense of laboratories has compelled the college to allow
the old physics requirement to remain as an alternative to the new one, but the
study of elementary astronomy is coupled with it; so that the amount of work
required is greater than in the laboratory course, and schools are rapidly
coming to teach the new in preference to the old. No such remarkable changes
have been made in the examinations in history and English, but in these
subjects, by comparing the old and the present examination papers, one sees the
same tendency which has been noticed in each of the previous subjects. The
pupil is not examined on facts alone, but is also obliged to show his powers of
analysis. The questions in history are now broader, and frequently deal with
the development of nations rather than with the incidental facts which marked
this development. In the English examination, the candidate is obliged to show
his practical acquaintance with English forms and good use by correcting
specimens of bad English, and by writing a short composition on a subject
chosen from the books he has read. To be able to do this he must have read the
books intelligently, and must have had sufficient practice in writing to
express himself readily and clearly.<p>

<p>

<p>

The advanced studies are supposed to occupy equal amounts of time in
preparation, and in that sense are considered equivalent. Hence the student, in
making his choice of two or more of them, is guided only by tastes and
abilities. The examinations in them demand the same kind of training that has
been pointed out in reference to the elementary studies. Each subject must be
studied from this same point of view, namely to train the thinking powers as
well as to store the mind with useful facts.<p>

<p>

<p>

In the four language studies the pupil must read more advanced works; that is,
works in which the style is less simple and the thought more profound. He
passes from simple narrative to poetry or argumentative prose. The requirement
in Latin is the reading at sight of average passages from Cicero and Virgil. In
Greek the passages are chosen from Homer or Herodotus. In Latin and Greek
composition the candidate must be able to translate passages of connected
English narrative into good Latin and Greek. In French and German he must show
his familiarity with certain specified works which have become classic, and,
moreover, must also be able to read at sight any passage of standard French and
German prose, and to write in these languages about the books which he has
read. In physics he must perform sixty additional experiments, covering the
same branches of the science which he has already studied, but requiring more
skill and knowledge of physics. The examination is like that in elementary
physics. In chemistry he must perform sixty experiments, covering the elements
of the science. He must keep a laboratory record, as in physics, and his
examination is of the same kind. In mathematics he goes from algebra and
geometry into higher branches of mathematical science. In trigonometry he must
not only study the science itself, but must also understand its practical
application to surveying and navigation. In solid geometry he applies his power
of geometrical reasoning which was got by a study of plane geometry to the
study of surfaces and solids. In analytical geometry he applies his knowledge
of algebra to the study of plane figures and conic sections. In advanced
algebra he studies the more abstract conceptions of higher algebraic
analysis.<p>

<p>

<p>

From this brief discussion of the forms of examination and the kind of
instruction which is required to meet such examination, it is seen that the
desire of the college is to require each student who is admitted not only to
have a large amount of useful knowledge, but at the same time to know how to
use this knowledge to the best advantage. All the changes which have been made
tend toward this desirable end. The old system of examination aimed to find out
whether the candidate had studied those books in language or science which the
college recommended. The new system aims to find out whether he can reason and
use the knowledge he has gained from those books. For instance, he is not asked
to show that he has read Caesar, but that he can read it. No cramming can
enable him to pass such examinations as these. Hence he must be educated. Every
pupil lays a good foundation to build his superstructure on, and can pursue the
courses of study offered to him in college to the best advantage. Each
elementary study is of great practical value to every man, whatever is to be
his calling in life, and can therefore be prescribed for all candidates without
imposing unnecessary and profitless work upon any one. Each subject, if taught
as the college evidently means to have it taught, makes the student think, and
gives its own peculiar training to his mind, beside imparting useful knowledge.
The classics give him broad yet exact conceptions, and enable him to read their
ancient literature when he is older and can appreciate it. The modern languages
give the same training to his mind, but to a much smaller extent, and open to
him the living literatures of two great nations beside his own. The mathematics
give exact but narrow conceptions, and the power to solve the practical
problems which meet a man at every turn. The natural sciences, while enlarging
his thinking powers, give him a knowledge of the forces around him, and show
him how truth may be learned from phenomena. English teaches him how to write
and speak his own tongue, and introduces him to the great thoughts of our own
literature. History gives him an insight into the deeds and motives of great
men and into the development of great nations. In short, every subject enlarges
the student's mind, and stores this enlarged mind with knowledge. Surely such a
requirement as this is a good foundation for a liberal education.

A side-glance at the construction of a drama will help to illustrate and

interpret this phenomenon. The drama, too, unfolds itself through the medium of

time, and uses the mechanism of logical and psychological consecution. Here a

plot is created, developed, lifted from level to level by continuously added

intrigues, the ascending line covering the predominant portion of its range;

until in the last (often short) act, the intricate threads disentangle, and no

superfluous wordiness hampers the precipitation to the end.<p>



<img src="graph.gif"

 width=283 height=103 align=right BORDER=0 alt="diagram">



The comparison with the drama, though applicable as an overall principle to

small forms like Ex. 321, intensifies with the larger musical forms. As the

drama will not roll on uninterruptedly, but subdivide into smaller sections --

acts, scenes -- so the larger musical form, even if still in one movement, will

provide, by subdivisions, for resting points and breathing space. And while the

short descending line will be relatively straight and taut, the long ascending

line, ascending as a whole, will show curves, notches, retarding moments,

similar to those of the melodic line (Ex. 134). A tragedy will not loosen its

grip after the climax; but before it, on the long way up to it, provision might

well be made for some temporary, refreshing laughs. They will help the reader

or spectator to brace himself for the ever tightening grip of the plot; and

interspersed as welcome little spots of contrast, they will prevent the

interest in the main problem from flagging and tiring. In the same way a light

comedy, straight to the point after the climax, will benefit by weaving into

the ascending section an occasional musing contemplation or a similar

incidental excursion into the more serious and weighty.<p>









<p>



In musical form these little contrasts within the main trend are not felt as

impairing the drive; on the contrary, they set it off to better advantage,

giving each section a new impetus.<p>



<p>



A masterpiece of form will reveal these qualities even though it may follow

none of the classical forms and may therefore deny any traditional approach of

formal analysis.<p>



<p>



Listen to a good recording of Wagner's "Meistersinger" Prelude; first let it

just affect you, then listen again with a score or piano-score.<p>



<p>



The almost constantly ascending line covers the overwhelmingly major part of

the piece, up to bar 211. The following diagram (Ex. 323) may illustrate its

periods of tension and relaxation. The numbers refer to the respective bars,

and the idea is to mark these bars in the piano score before reading it

together with a recorded or live performance.<p>



<p>



The ascending fragments of the line tend to preserve the key (C major) and the

pushing, driving, vigorous, masculine character. The receding fragments provide

the change of mood (Lyrical, feminine in bars 27 - 37, 89ff; grave, impressive

in 59ff; humorous, mocking in 122ff) which is also largely supported by change

of key.<p>



<p>



With the exception of the sudden change at 122, the indentations do not appear

as pronounced as in the diagram; rather they are softened by smooth modulations

and occasional bridges (37 - 41, 89 - 97). A constant undercurrent of moving

contrapuntal voices, often supported by or resulting in massed, tension-charged

harmonies, keeps driving, urging, rolling the masses like molten metal in the

process of founding, and constantly building, building, building. Each of the

mounting fragments marks the achievement of a higher level, until, in a broad,

last, irresistible sweep (158 - 211) a gigantic, crushing climax is reached,

triumphant like the hoisting of the victorious flag in conquered territory.

From this peak, the piece plunges to its end in a few bars.<p>



<p>



Wagner was often accused of making a hodgepodge, a potpourri of the themes

contained in his operas, for their respective overtures. In "Rienzi" he still

kept to the traditional overture in the sonata form. But feeling somehow

restrained in his personal ideas by this -- or probably any -- traditional

form, he created his own form and mastered it. True, he used the themes of the

opera for material. But why should such material be less fit for perfect form,

if tamed and subjugated by the master's hand? And if it is true that in highest

art. content and form coincide (which means that inspiration creates its own

form) it is equally true that form as a tool -- self-created or accepted --

retroactively can have an inspiring effect on the artist, as even the mere

objective tool may have -- the blank manuscript paper, canvas or marble

block.<p>



<p>



So in a piece like the "Meistersinger" Prelude, form is neither a loose

potpourri nor just the "grouping of a given thematic material", as the notion

of form is frequently defined. Irregular and unruly in every detail as it seems

to be, akin nowhere in detail or <i>in toto</i> to any of the traditional

forms, its form is compellingly, irresistibly, inescapably present --

omnipresent, <i>sovereign</i>, responding in the highest degree to <i>the

shaping forces in music.</i><p>



<p>



A promise is given in the beginning of the piece which is magnificently

fulfilled in the end. A goal is set up which, approached step by step in

constant onward drive, is gloriously reached. We set out in venturesome youth

and, seasoned by the events of the journey, we return wise and mature.<p>



<p>



In such interpretations by way of feeling and touch, we may approach such

nondescript, yet ever so present form. At the same time, while none of the

traditional forms is catalogued by this approach, a most important basic

principle is revealed: The principle of <i>tripartition</i>. To it most of the

forms can be traced, regardless of their substructures, proportions, standards,

terms.<p>



<p>



It is of little concern whether we call the three parts exposition, development

and reprise, or the sections of the three-part song-form, or Menuetto, Trio and

da Capo, or just A B A. The affinity and correlation of the flanking parts will

always be felt as against the middle part, the bearer of intensification, plot,

<i>contrast.</i> Whence we came, thither we return, after all the blooming and

climaxing, after all the turbulence and trepidation. The principle of

tripartition, as manifest in art, is rooted in nature, in our souls, in our

very existence.<p>



<p>

<A NAME="back">

And here is where the "formless" Meistersinger Prelude touches classical form

-- in the high-levelled, if epitomized, reprise and coda (measure 188 to the

end) of its missing "Sonata".  [It may be mentioned here that the term "Sonata"

originally meant nothing else than played music, instrumental music, <i>musica

sonata</i> as contrasted to sung music, vocal music, <i>musica cantata]</i>.<p>



<p>



It is easy enough to see that the principle of tripartition also applies to a

piece as small as Ex. 321. Phrases 1 and 2 obviously make up one coherent part,

as against phrase 3, the contrasting middle part, and phrase 4, the reprise.

Flatly, there is no such a thing as a two-part song-form. What makes song-form

as such the prototype of the tripartite form, is simply the presence of a

contrasting middle section between two analogous flanking sections,

irrespective of any number of bars or any other tabulations. To divide

song-form into one two-part, and one three-part song-form is like dividing the

family of dogs into a group of dogs with four legs, and a group of dogs with a

wart on the left jowl.<p>



<p>



Small as the curve of the little phrase 3 (Ex. 321) is, it deserves all the

interest and all the credit for bringing about FORM. Here, in this middle

section of the song-form, is the place for the tension so essential for good

form.<p>



<p>



The following <A HREF="example.htm">example</A> may illustrate how high 

this curve, scarcely more than an indication in Ex.  321, may bulge and 

vault in the master's hand to result in utterly delightful, masterly 

form.<p>



<p>



The composer could easily have satisfied the academic requirements by entering

the reprise after the half-cadence in bar 18. The modulation back to the tonic

was consummated, nothing was in the way of the return.<p>



<p>



Instead, what happens? Ignoring the easy path, the passage swerves to a remote

key and from there, traveling through ever new keys (25 - 33) soars high up, to

land again on the dominant (bar 33) and to enjoy now, only now, the infinitely

more gratifying reprise.<p>



<p>



And while we are on the subject: Again it would have been easy to make the

conventional reprise, perhaps concluding it in the main key by merely

transposing the last four bars (9, 10, 11, 12) into F major. Nothing of the

kind happens. First of all the theme itself is diverted right after the first

pair of bars. And now, like a faint reverberation of the preceding surge, the

tide again rises in threefold sequence (38ff) until it breaks upon the

unexpected D major triad (43). Nonplussed, as it were, the passage turns back

and, groping about in utmost tenderness, floats down, and, finally, <i>only

now</i>, home.<p>



<p>



What is this? An "episode"? An "extension"? Any other standard device?<p>



<p>



Anything can be an extension, if, in such a classification, we are satisfied to

include any insertion of a larger or smaller number of additional bars. Under

such circumstances, the formative function of such additional bars can be

utterly meaningless, and their classification under any heading can be as

futile as an identical equation or an identical definition.<p>



<p>



What elevates these two "extensions" of the Schubert Menuetto to the real

function of creating, not <i>a</i> form, but FORM, is the fact that they,

precisely they, are the very theater of the tension-relaxation duel, which we

cannot escape feeling when we listen to the piece. <p>



<p>



Here we see inspiration molded into sublimest form and, equally, form elevated

to sublimest inspiration -- the consummate absorption of each by the other.<p><BR>

<H2>A Conversation on Landscape Restoration: Excerpts<br> From Cullen Murphy's 
Interview With Peter Hatch</h2>

</center>
<p><pre>

</pre>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>

<font size=4>
<B>Cullen Murphy:</B> Could you describe for me the general world of horticulture and
historical restoration -- what the various schools of thought are?<p>

<p>

<B>Peter Hatch:</B> I can think of two sorts of fields or approaches to the topic. One
is the whole philosophy behind the idea of landscape restoration.  Gardens and trees grow up. If you were going to duplicate
Jefferson's garden here at Monticello, for example, you would have to cut out
the large trees, because in his day they would have been saplings.  What we aspire to do at  Monticello is 
to provide a vignette of what existed, and we really can't produce the absolute
truth, the historic garden, because it was always changing and you can't
duplicate that -- the quantity of weeds that were in the garden, or so many of
these detailed things that make so much of what a garden is. 
<p>We can get a sense
of these details in terms of the character of the plants; for example, the
species of flowers we've left in there were more for  fragrance or curiosity
than for show or display. The Chinaberry tree also gives you a good
sense of the taste of the early nineteenth century from a very sophisticated
and cosmopolitan figure, Thomas Jefferson; we regard the tree today as a common
leaf tree. 
<p>Jefferson designed the idea of the grove, which I think tells a lot
about him and his ideal of the true American garden. And it is also a good
example of a historical concept that has a lot of relevance today. So the central issue in some ways is how the garden is interpreted as much as
how it is portrayed. I think it is very important that historic sites extend a
lot of energy to
introducing people to what they are experiencing, because it is impossible to
recreate a historic landscape. But you can compromise and create a vignette, or
some degree of a pulse of a historic landscape fairly effectively, as I think
we have done at Monticello.<p>

	I guess another issue is the living, historical farm, versus the historic
garden. There are a lot of places where the garden is interpreted in terms of
its labor, people are costumed doing labor in fields, and people are using
historic tools to take care of the plants and gardens. That is a very
effective historical interpretant, and an educational tool. We
don't do that at Monticello just because I think other people are doing it very
well--places like Old Sturbridge Village and Plimoth Plantation. We are just
trying to communicate the interests of Thomas Jefferson and a little about the
character of gardens in the early nineteenth century. So we are not purists in
our approach. We view it as a historical farm, with modern tools and machinery,
and use sort of a casual approach to the horticultural technology that is
available today. <p>

<p>

<B>CM:</B> Are there any riddles about this place?<p>

<p>
<B>PH:</B> Thomas Jefferson is a riddle; I think that is what makes him such an
incredible figure. He is all things to all people. He is an 
ambiguous figure; in terms of landscape, in terms of politics, in terms of
slavery, or whatever, he oscillated throughout his life. Like all of us, he
evolved and changed a great deal. 
<p> I think what is unique about our landscape program is
that we have all of this documentation. In some ways the documentation leads to
just further riddles and puzzles. One example is the mystery of the Jefferson
Grape. Although Jefferson was this avid wine
lover, and aspired to make wine at Monticello, and was a great pioneer in
American viniculture, we have no documentation that he ever made wine here at
Monticello. And so what happened to all of these plants? That is a riddle.<p>

	Another riddle that we have at Monticello is  what this
place looked like  in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century. In some ways we know more about it when
Jefferson was here than we do when the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation was taking over the property
in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. We have some very sparse documentation of what
this place was like that we are trying to
flesh out by getting some oral histories. But still, how the landscape
evolved between Jefferson's death and the purchase of the property by the
Foundation up through today -- there are a lot of riddles from every era. People
talk about landscape in terms of a variety of layers, different chapters that
occur through time. Really filling out the pages of those chapters
is always a puzzle. <p>

One approach we have taken has been to assemble all of the late-nineteenth and 
early-twentieth-century photographs of Monticello, and to
put them on a computer program called CARPET, Computer-Aided Reverse
Perspective Analysis. The photograph is a two-dimensional image of a three
dimensional object, and just by looking at a photograph, you cannot tell
exactly where the trees were. Through this computer model we made initial stabs
to pinpoint where all of the trees were in the late-nineteenth and early-
twentieth centuries. Hopefully, in the future, we will be able to look at a
little bit of the evolution of the history of those tree plants since
Jefferson's death.<p> The system might also be effective at taking paintings
contemporary with Jefferson -- from, say, the 1820s and the 1830s -- and looking at the
trees and shrubs that are portrayed in those paintings and putting them on the
very same computer model. And maybe identify what was there in 1824 versus
1830, 1870 to 1910, and on. That is an important plan, and it is one way
through scientific and modern means of trying to decipher some of these
riddles. And archaeology, of course, is another way of doing it. New documents
come to light, too. A new page of Jefferson's <i>Garden Book </i>came to light 

about ten years ago. Just a marvelous thing to discover. You think you know it
all in terms of landscape and gardening from the documentation, but these
things do surface. Contemporary
descriptions of Monticello also surface from time to time. They provide a very clear window in some ways to
what life was like during that period.<p>

<blockquote>

	<i><font size=4></i></font><p>

	

	

	<pre>

	

	</pre>

	

	<font size=5>T</font>here is no one who loves a proverb better than does the native of Madagascar.

From the thousands in use he is always sure to be able to select one

appropriate for the moment, whether he be sending his friends to ask the hand

of his bride-to-be, or gathering his relatives around his deathbed, or merely

bargaining for his piece of beef in the market place. Above all, when he

becomes a Christian and speaks in church or prayer meeting, his proverbs come

to his aid so easily and aptly that the young missionary is often ashamed to

follow him with the most carefully prepared of sermons. Many of these proverbs

have been handed down from the days when all life in Madagascar was very

primitive. Some of them depend for their meaning upon beliefs and customs that

no longer exist. Yet in comparing a collection of them with our own proverbs

one is as surprised at the likenesses as at the differences.<p>



<p>



The Malagasy have a 'Don't be a crowing hen' proverb, but they say nothing

about whistling girls. They have also 'Don't kick a sleeping dog' and 'Don't

take another mouthful until you have swallowed what is in your mouth,' which

have a familiar ring. The rolling stone, in Madagascar, is famed not for

gathering no moss, but because 'it never stops till it reaches the bottom.'

This saying is used when a native is shaking his head in sad doubt as to the

conduct of another. The pot that calls the kettle black is there only a

dangerous companion: 'Those who are near the pot get black.' A dog's bark may

be worse than his bite, but the native is wise enough to remark of it, 'The

dog's bark, it is n't might, but fright.' In Madagascar the love of money is

not called the root of all evil; it is 'the tail of witchcraft'! There is a

'fish that got away' proverb, but it goes further: 'An eel not caught is as big

as your thigh; a hill not seen is like calamity.' 'In union there is strength'

appears there, most fittingly, in the form, 'Cross in a crowd and the crocodile

won't eat you,' and in 'Men are like the rim of a pot and one all round,' and

the more homely but very characteristic saying, 'One finger can't catch a

louse.'<p>



<p>



On the other hand there are many which we can appreciate, but which have no

English or American cousins: 'Cleansing others, but wasting away in the

process, like soap'; 'Poverty won't allow him to lift up his head; dignity

won't allow him to bow it down'; 'To be two things like a bat: flying it's a

bird, resting it's a mouse'; 'Not knowing what to do, like the stepchild: if he

does n't wash his hands he is called dirty, if he does he is wasting the

water'; 'Guilt repented of becomes righteousness, but righteousness boasted of

becomes the grandfather of guilt'; 'The end of an ox is beef, and the end of a

lie is exposure.'<p>



<p>



Long before Madagascar natives came into contact with Christian missionaries

they had a number of what we should call good Christian proverbs. 'Don't think

yourself hidden in the silent valley, for God is overhead' employs the term

Andriamanitra, literally 'the fragrant sovereign,' a name which in the old days

meant a supernatural ruler, or a deceased king who had come to be regarded as

divine. Andriamanitra is now used by the Christian natives as one of the names

for our God. Before the arrival of missionaries the Malagasy did not worship

Andriamanitra, but one can have no doubt, after becoming familiar with their

proverbs, that they attributed to him many qualities which show him to be the

same omniscient Judge. 'Better be guilty with man than guilty with God'; 'God

hates evil'; 'An axe with a notched edge: if the people don't notice it the

tree will'; 'One is blessed by man and the other is blessed by God.' Our 'Don't

count your chickens before they are hatched' has been said by the Malagasy:

'Don't decide before God, like the hatcher of fowls.' <p>



<p>



Others could not be transplanted so easily into our own soil. There is one

which says, 'The earth is God's chief wife; she maintains the living and guards

the dead.' This refers to the days when polygamy was practised more generally

in Madagascar than it is to-day. The first, or chief, wife had the care of the

property and added to it as often as she could. Another says, 'The dead are not

buried on Thursdays or Sundays, because the living are considered.' That is

because Thursday and Sunday are unlucky days, and it is believed even yet in

some parts of the island that a funeral on either of those days will soon be

followed by many more funerals. The custom of wearing a lamba or sort of shawl

has given rise to 'When God has made a plain face, covering the head won't make

it handsome.' Another, which might well be remembered, but is n't always, when

they are dealing with unsuspecting foreigners, is 'The simple are not cheated,

because God is feared.' Perhaps the foreigner is not regarded as simple, but as

fair game, no matter how little he may know of the island and of its scale of

prices. Another, which should have more general application than it has, is

'when the day is dark a light can be used; when the water is deep a canoe can

be used; when the moat is deep a ladder can be used; but there is nothing that

can be done for an evil deed.' The little American boy might say that in his

Sunday school! <p>



<p>



They speak lightly of the diviner, who, nevertheless, still makes his living in

all parts of Madagascar. 'Mr. Headshaker's prediction: if it is n't a boy it

will be a girl' is reminiscent of an American doctor who made his position

equally sure by finding out in advance which the parents wanted and then

prophesying that it would be the other. If he was right they did not complain,

and if they got what they wanted they did not complain.<p>



<p>



'Sorrow I can bear, but not the professional mourner' has more sophistication

than we should expect from the gentle savage. So also has 'A hard old woman who

is not made compassionate by the past.' 'A cow is ill, and a bull is the

doctor's fee' sounds like a bitter jest that might have been applied to an

American lawyer. To be philosophical does not necessarily mean to have had a

formal education. The Malagasy says, 'A wife to be divorced has many faults, a

lass not married looks excellent, a woman not yet made a mother-in-law seems

easy to get along with.' The poor mother-in-law gets the worst of it in

whatever civilization she may find herself! There must be universal truth in 'A

tall tree is hated by the wind, and a rich man by his neighbors,' but one would

dislike having to live next to the man who says, 'When there is a rice field to

be dug I call in others; when there is salted eel for dinner I have no friends

but the dead,' or to be engaged to the one who says, 'Marriage is not a fast

knot, but a slip knot.'<p>



<p>



Here is a new way of saying 'David and Jonathan': 'Let your friendship be that

of the mouth and the hand: if the hand is hurt the mouth blows it, if the mouth

is hurt the hand strokes it.' Then there are 'Don't love me as you do a door,

liked, but pushed to and fro,' and 'Don't be so much in love that you can't

tell when the rain is coming,' which latter could easily be listed among our

own proverbs, if it is not already one of them.<p>



<p>



Studying the proverbs of a people, the common sayings of their everyday life,

and the philosophy of their more serious moments, one comes to a close

understanding of that people. The Malagasy show depths of feeling, as in

'Sorrow is like a precious treasure: shown only to friends,' and 'I am deserted

by you when I am not yet recovered, and yearning for you is two thirds of my

malady,' and true nicety in 'Let your love be like the misty rain, coming

softly, but flooding the river'; but in the long run the spirit of the tropics

wins out and 'Love is like young rice: transplanted, still it grows' and as for

life, 'Life is a shadow and a mist; it passes quickly by and is no more.'

<blockquote>

<p>



<p>



<font size=5>D</font>ear Mr. Webber:<p>



<p>



I have tried my very best -- in all conscientiousness -- to help you.  I must

go one step farther, even at the risk not to be fully understood by you, whom I

do not know personally; though I hope you will understand and believe me if

you, too, do your best, follow all my remarks equally conscientiously and

without sensitivity and vanity, just as you would trust and submit to the

diagnosis of an experienced doctor, even though it may hurt at the moment.

There is no other way to real help.<p>



<p>



Your case is by no means hopeless; let me anticipate this.  On the contrary,

you show definitely a certain musical imagination and a natural leaning, even

gift; your choice of a musical form which probably is the hardest to master,

speaks for the earnestness of your ambition and musical taste.  But you lack

completely even the most fundamental and primitive bases of knowledge, in every

direction.  And unavowedly, you betray even your subconscious (or conscious?)

awareness of this deplorable status of your knowledge or lack of knowledge.

What you really mean to compose is a fugue -- why resort to subterfuges and

excuses?  But somehow you feel your incompetency; so you call it bashfully,

pretending modesty, a "Fugato."  In  doing so, you try, unconsciously or half

consciously, to invite leniency on the part of the expert, your possible

critic.  You try to cover up your shortcomings before yourself; you try to

deceive yourself.  Why?  I am sorry I have to tell you it is far from being a

"fugato" as well -- if we ever should admit such a principal difference other

than in size or weight; but a fugue, collapsing in its very fundaments right

from its start to the whole of its ill course, does not make a "fugato" either.

Complete insufficiency does not enter the meaning of the term.  Nor can I help

having the same feeling as to your psychic reasons for calling the customary

Prelude, bashfully again (and ornately at the same time) "Entrada" (or

"Intrada," as you write).  The reason for its shortness is no other than the

fact that your muse deserted you deplorably prematurely, leaving you in the

barren field without knowledge, where to turn or what to do; so you jump

incoherently -- <i>incoherence is the paramount feature of your whole

composition</i> -- into the motivical, or preparatory, announcement of the

fugue theme (good as this is in itself).<p>



<p>



Let me make a comparison.  You take a piece of cloth (we will skip the question

if this piece of cloth, or material, is good in itself; it may be at least

workable, anyway) and decide to make a suit of it for yourself.  It turns out

that the suit is no good.  One trouser is as much too long as the other is too

short; the same with the sleeves; one of them besides, is sewed in upside down;

the lining appears on the outside instead of inside; the pockets are in the

back; no two buttons are alike in size or colour etc, etc, etc.  What are you

going to do, instead of the only reasonable thing, namely, to throw it into the

fire and learn first how to tailor?  You try to think of the best tailors in

the country and mail the miscarriage to one of them, or to some of them,

expecting them to remedy the calamity.  <p>



<p>



I assure you, the only way of "correcting" your composition for me or any 

composer of my standards would be to recompose the whole thing from the 

first to the last bar; and, of course, you cannot expect to find any such 

composer to do that.  Speaking of coherence: A composition must grow 

organically, like a tree; there must be no seams, no gaps, no foreign 

matter; the sap of the tree must pass through the whole body of it, reach 

every branch and twig and leaf of it.  It must grow, grow, grow instead of 

being patched, patched, patched, unorganically.  Instead of putting pieces 

of a whole together, as I say, uncoherently, you must let them grow out of 

one another, join them coherently, overlap their limbs or sections, instead 

of letting them dangle in the air miserably.  I say again, read my book 

"The Sh.  F <nobr>.  . .  ,"</nobr> read it very attentively, study it; 

most of all the section "Form," especially Chapter XL, "The Art of 

Joining," follow closely all analyses.  (I am sure you can get the book in 

your public library; it appeared last July.)  Also in the section "Melody" 

you will find much you need badly.  Your orchestration is just as wanting.  

It must help to clarify a fugue; by opposing the various sections -- 

Woodwinds, Brass, Strings; let only one of them play at a time, then 

proceed joining them gradually and keeping them <i>transparent</i> all the 

time, being always intent on the <i>plasticity</i> of the piece (for which, 

to be sure, it first has to be composed accordingly).  Your orchestration 

is most of the time a muddle, just the opposite of plastic.  Summarising: 

What you need is to study, then study hard, to study still harder.  Listen 

to good music as much as you can, <i>copy</i> master scores with open eyes 

and ears; listen while reading the score.<p>



<p>



Believe me, I spent the better part of a week with your score.  If I would

charge you at the rate of my teaching fee, it would cost you a fortune.  As it

is, and since, in spite of best will on both sides, I might have caused you

some disappointment, maybe even some personal hurt (which I could not help and

which, I am sure, will still turn out for the better to you if you take to

heart everything I told you and <i>read everything in the score and in the

letter carefully</i>), I will not even refer to my first letter and just forget

about the balance.  I will admit that much is performed nowadays which is not

much of a composition either.  But this fact cannot change my standards and

should not influence yours either, if you take art seriously, as everyone must

do who seeks real achievement and accomplishment.<p>

	<font size=5>T</font>HEY say
that nothing succeeds like success, but there is one thing that can beat 
it, at
least in arts and entertainment: success followed by self-annihilation. 
Thus 
it's slightly surprising that the mass-market rediscovery of Jack Kerouac 
has
taken so long. It's been nearly forty years since the publication of <i>On 
the
Road </i>(1957) hurtled him into instant international fame--household-word
fame that he couldn't handle and gradually lost, but not before it cost 
him his
dearest friendships, the fulfillment of his artistic promise, and most of 
his
personal freedom in the twelve years remaining until his alcoholic death, 
in
1969.<p>

Surprising, but not entirely so. At marketing meetings Kerouac is no doubt
pitched as "the James Dean of American Lit.," but the real man and his work
don't fit that image, any more than he fit the marketing label "King of the
Beats" in the 1950s. His writing--quirky and digressive and not always 
easy to
read, sometimes nearly impenetrable--is more of an acquired taste than
publicists might wish. As to the man, he was a handsome guy who took a good
photo, but he was not the charismatic figure of his legend; by all 
accounts he
was shy, even insecure, possessed little personal glamour, and wasn't as
adventurous as most of his friends. He portrayed himself honestly in his 
books,
even in the most-often-quoted passage in all of his work--the point in 
<i>On
the Road </i>when Dean Moriarty (Neal Cassady) meets Carlo Marx (Allen
Ginsberg):<p>
<blockquote>
A tremendous thing happened when Dean met Carlo Marx. Two keen minds that 
they
are, they took to each other at the drop of a hat. Two piercing eyes 
glanced
into two piercing eyes--the holy con-man with the shining mind, and the
sorrowful poetic con-man with the dark mind that is Carlo Marx. From that 
moment on I saw
very little of Dean, and I was a little sorry too. Their energies met 
head-on,
I was a lout compared, I couldn't keep up with them. The whole mad swirl of
everything that was to come began then; it would mix up all my friends and 
all
I had left of my family in a big dust cloud over the American Night. . . . 
They
rushed down the street together, digging everything in the early way they 
had,
which later became so much sadder and perceptive and blank. But then they
danced down the streets like dingledodies, and I shambled after as I've 
been doing all
my life after people who interest me, because the only people for me are 
the
mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, 
desirous
of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a 
commonplace
thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding 
like
spiders across the stars. . . .</blockquote> <p>

Those phrases describing "the only people for me" are almost always quoted 
out
of context. In context, one is most struck by the narrator's 
self-deprecation
and alienation, the outsider's yearning, the fact that Kerouac never felt
himself to <i>be </i>one of those fantastic beings he admired so deeply. 
Those
who find out about the people who burn, burn, burn from a T-shirt 
inscription
don't know that Sal Paradise (the character based on Kerouac) "shambled" 
after
the "mad ones" who interested him--"a lout compared" who couldn't keep 
up.<p>

But suitable for myth or not, in the marketplace Jack is back, heralded by 
new
editions, products, and events: the two books under discussion here; a
movie-in-progress of <i>On the Road, </i>produced by Francis Ford Coppola;
museum shows on Beat culture; and even a 
<A 
HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/cdroms/95/52/index4a.html">CD-ROM</A>--which, 
I should point out, I
co-produced with my wife, Kate Bernhardt. Ann Charters, the editor of 
these two
books, was a paid consultant to that CD-ROM project, a venture proposed to 
me
by a multimedia start-up company because I was a fiction writer with an
interest in computers and digital media, not because I was a Kerouac 
fanatic.
Indeed, my not being a Kerouac fanatic was one reason I was considered a 
good
choice for the job, and one reason I took it. Having now spent a lot of 
time
looking into his life and career, I can report that I find Jack Kerouac to 
be a
fascinating man, a worthy, though wildly uneven, author, and without 
question a
problematic figure in almost every respect. <p>
 
<font size=5>K</font>EROUAC was born in 1922 into a French-Canadian 
working-class family in the
mill city of Lowell, Massachusetts, where his first language was a Canadian
dialect of French. He didn't speak English until he was six or seven years 
old.
Later in life he would cite the French mold of his mind to account for his
literary uniqueness, a claim more credible than many other claims he made 
about
himself. While growing up, he possessed a natural, nearly classical 
balance of
mind and body, and his destiny was influenced by the eventual loss of that
balance. A bookish, imaginative boy and a prep-school football star 
combined,
he won a <A 
HREF="http://www.charm.net/~brooklyn/Places/Columbia.html">sports 
scholarship to Columbia University</A> but broke his leg in one of
the first games of his freshman year and sat out the rest of the season. 
The
hiatus intensified a latent animosity between Kerouac and the Columbia 
football
coach, and the following year Kerouac, whose leg had fully healed, quit the
team. Though it was capricious and at least partly self-imposed, the end 
of his
formal athletic career was nonetheless a crucial factor in Kerouac's 
destiny,
because the inability to use his body in a publicly heroic way robbed him 
of
half his self-definition. <p>
 
He soon encountered <A 
HREF="http://www.charm.net/~brooklyn/People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen 
Ginsberg</A> and <A HREF="http://www.hyperreal.com/wsb/">William 
Burroughs</A> in New York, and
mental excitement came to dominate his life. He felt himself to be part of 
an
important artistic vanguard, and to fuel his intense immersions in the twin
landscapes of Manhattan and his imagination, he began to take large 
amounts of
Benzedrine, using the typical hipster technique of breaking open
over-the-counter nasal inhalers to get at the drug-soaked  inserts. While 
still
in his twenties he was hospitalized for serious phlebitis of the legs 
brought
on by that particular substance abuse. Many writers and artists have been
addicted to alcohol or drugs, but Kerouac underwent one of the more 
striking
personal deteriorations in the world of American literature, surpassing 
even
the decline of F. Scott Fitzgerald. The person he had been in college was
almost unrecognizable in the wreck he was by his early forties.<p>

Readers with a vague romantic notion of Kerouac as an artistic rebel and
hitchhiking hero of the open road will be surprised to learn that he had a
fragile, tenuous sense of his own identity. One of his most prescient
observations about himself comes early in <i>Selected Letters</i>. 
 Kerouac, twenty-one years old, was in a psychiatric unit undergoing
observation after refusing to take orders during his brief stint in the
Navy--an instance of his lifelong aversion to institutional authority. To 
his
boyhood friend George Apostolos, back in Lowell, he wrote, "It is the 
price I
pay for having a malleable personality. It assumes the necessary shape 
when in
contact with any other personality." Later in life his relationships with 
<A HREF="http://www.Charm.net/~brooklyn/People/NealCassady.html">Neal
Cassady</A>, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, and <A 
HREF="http://www.library.kent.edu/speccoll/poetry/snyder.html">Gary 
Snyder</A>  all reflected to
some degree his tendency to follow after and try to merge himself with 
people
he admired. Though he chose the "lonesome traveler" life, Kerouac did not 
like
to be alone. Yet nothing he did could repair his essential aloneness. He
yearned to publish his first novel, <i>The Town and the City</i>, but 
after he
did so, he wrote in a 1949 letter to the writer Alan Harrington,<p>
<blockquote>
I am no longer "beat," I have money, a career. I am more <i>alone </i>than 
when
I "lurked" on Times Square at 4 A.M., or hitch-hiked penniless down the
highways of the night. It's strange. And yet I was never a "rebel," only a
happy, sheepish imbecile, open-hearted &amp; silly with joys. And so I
<i>remain</i>. </blockquote><p>

<font size=5>M</font>ANY aspects of Kerouac's real life were obscured by 
his fame and are not
widely appreciated, including his intellectual seriousness as a young man 
and
his commitment to becoming an influential literary artist. Mark Van Doren, 
one
of his professors at Columbia, noticed Kerouac's literary bent and keen 
insight
into Shakespeare. In fact, it was Van Doren who recommended <i>The Town 
and the
City</i> to the publisher Robert Giroux. Kerouac had written this long,
rambling book in the late 1940s, while he was a member of the group that
included Burroughs and Ginsberg, but the novel was quite conventional, 
nearly a
homage to the literary hero of his youth, Thomas Wolfe. Even while writing
<i>The Town and the City</i>, Kerouac began to lose interest in that sort 
of
literature, and once the 1,000-page manuscript was out of his system, he 
began
to look for a new "method" of writing. <p>

Finding a way to release his authentic voice became the great artistic 
project
of Kerouac's life. In 1945, even before he began the first novel, he wrote 
to
Ginsberg, "Until I find a way to unleash the inner life in an art-method,
nothing about me will be clear." It would take Kerouac until the early 
1950s to
find that method--uncensored, improvisational "spontaneous prose," 
inspired by
his beloved bebop jazz. As he wrote to the critic and editor Malcolm 
Cowley:<p>
<blockquote>
The requirements for prose &amp; verse are the same, i.e. 
<i>blow</i>--What a
man most wishes to hide, revise, and un-say, is precisely what Literature 
is
waiting and bleeding for-- . . . .</blockquote>
<p>
Cowley got <i><A 
HREF="http://www.charm.net/~brooklyn/Books/OnTheRoad.html">On the 
Road</A></i> published in 1957, but he had been prepared to
champion it in 1953. <i>On the Road</i> wasn't published in 1953 simply 
because
Kerouac didn't believe in revision and refused to listen to Cowley's 
misgivings
about the novel's dramatic redundancy and lack of "control." And though 
Kerouac
understood that Cowley was asking him to "get it over the plate," he 
couldn't
respect the advice enough to take it. Ginsberg, who in 1953 was 
functioning as
a literary agent for both Kerouac and William Burroughs, also had 
misgivings
about Kerouac's self-indulgence in the manuscript, and called him a "holy 
fool"
for rejecting editors' opinions and thus keeping his books unpublished. 
Kerouac
was enraged by the criticism, and angrily broke with Ginsberg for a time
because of it. But two years later, in May of 1955, Kerouac wrote to 
Ginsberg,<p>
<blockquote>
Well today I wrapped up a 10,000 word short story called "cityCityCITY" and
sent it to Cowley asking him to figure someplace to send it and recommend 
it
too if he wants and suddenly in a P S I admitted I'd been a fool early 1953
refusing to publish ON THE ROAD with him. Allen do you realize if I had
published then, by now I'd have been in the money all this time, would have
traveled to Europe, Tangiers, and maybe India or even China and Japan and 
would
have probably published [the novel <i>Doctor Sax</i>] and also written 
great
new works obtaining from inspirations of travel. . . . Now I suppose 
Cowley may
laugh at me. . . . I suppose he figures I'm big underground martyr hero 
ready
to spend life unpublished like Grieg and Tashcaikowsky [sic], crying in the
dark.</blockquote> <p>

Had Kerouac been less arrogant with Cowley in 1953, he might have gained 
more
than just traveling money and new experiences. He might have had a 
different
destiny. For we see from his letters that Kerouac's addictive behavior
intensified most damagingly during those crucial years of disappointment 
and
rejection, and his social persona became brittle with the defensiveness and
guilt that ruined his friendships.<p>

Kerouac didn't deserve Truman Capote's famous dismissal to the effect that 
his
work wasn't writing but typing--or at least he didn't deserve to have the
remark stick the way it has. But clever putdowns tend to stick if there's 
any
truth in them at all, and it's simply true that Kerouac's theory of 
spontaneous
prose is often easier to respect than his practice of it. Kerouac did not
believe that just any sort of "automatic" writing was automatically 
literature.
He thought that the making of true spontaneous prose was more difficult and
demanding than ordinary writing accomplished through a process of revision.
Like a jazz musician or a silk painter, the true spontaneous-prose artist 
had
to be utterly "present" during the act of creation, completely in the 
moment,
and had only one chance to get it right. Kerouac saw writing as a 
performing
art, and a grueling one, requiring arduous compositional marathons and 
habits
of mind cultivated by long practice. Having had his athletic career cut 
short,
he pursued writing in an athletic way, often spending twelve or more hours
nonstop at the typewriter, using long rolls of teletype paper so that he 
could
write uninterrupted.<p>

Like any athlete or performer, he would have on days and off days, and the
trick was to maximize the on days. Most writers deny that they have ever
written a single word in any condition other than stone-cold sobriety. At 
least
some of them are lying. Kerouac always admitted that he wrote while he was
high. <i>Selected Letters</i> confirms that he rarely wrote fiction 
<i>except
</i>under the influence of one substance or another--Benzedrine, 
marijuana, or
alcohol in his early years, mostly alcohol later on. For Kerouac, literal
intoxication provided both the physical rush that propelled him through his
long writing sessions and the freedom from his censorious self--his
internalization of his clannish, Old World family and particularly of his
mother, the ever-present "M&eacute;m&egrave;re."<p>

Before substance abuse destroyed Kerouac's body, it disfigured his 
undeniable
literary talent by fueling a growing delusion that anything he composed 
during
his orgiastic pleasure trips at the typewriter was worth the attention of 
the
reading public. His writing often gleams with sharp turns of phrase, 
off-kilter
perceptions, and the well-remembered detail of strange adventures, but 
just as
often it devolves into a shaggy-dog story. Since subjecting his work to
revision would damage its authenticity, it went out the way it was. 
Naturally,
editors kept rejecting it with lectures about "craft" that infuriated 
Kerouac,
who would then go drink some more and take it out on the typewriter 
again.<p>

It's particularly ironic, therefore, that the book we know as <i>On the
Road</i>, Kerouac's most famous and most accomplished work, wasn't written
"spontaneously." Renditions of the Kerouac myth rarely mention that 
although he
did write the original version of <i>On the Road </i>in one burst on his
legendary teletype paper rolls, he re-wrote and recast it many times in the
seven or eight years before it was published.<p>

<font size=5>K</font>EROUAC couldn't have wished for a better editor than 
his fiction and letters
have now found in Ann Charters, who also published the first--and still the
most widely read--biography of him in 1973, only four years after his 
death.
Charters once worked closely with Kerouac, in 1966, when she was preparing 
the
first annotated bibliography of his work. She knows the material as well as
anybody, yet she possesses a scholarly detachment that is absent in most
Kerouac fans. <i>The Portable Kerouac </i>is without question the single 
best
introduction to his work. For those already familiar with some of Kerouac's
books and interested in the man who wrote them, <i>Selected Letters:
1940-1956</i>, arranged chronologically with headnotes by Charters, will 
be a
revelation.<p>
<i> The Portable </i>confers upon Kerouac the literary legitimacy he so 
craved. (He thought
that a Viking Portable edition of his work would be a grand idea, and 
mentioned
it to friends a number of times.) It does not fulfill his ultimate 
publishing
fantasy, however: a uniform edition of all his mature work, to be issued 
as The
Duluoz Legend. That title is drawn from the name Jack Duluoz--Kerouac's
preferred pseudonym, though he did not use it in <i>On the Road</i>, 
<i>The 
Dharma Bums</i>
(1958),or <i>The Subterraneans</i> (1958),his three best-known books. As 
he wrote in
the introduction to <i>Big Sur</i> (1962), "My work comprises one vast 
book like
Proust's except that my remembrances are written on the run instead of
afterwards in a sick bed."
</a></h1>
He says "remembrances" not only to echo Proust but also because early in 
his
career Kerouac had ceased to think of himself as a fiction writer per se. 
In
1950 he wrote to Neal Cassady, "I have renounced fiction and fear. There is
nothing to do but write the truth. There is no other reason to write." Like
prose that had been subjected to revision, invented characters and drama 
seemed
inauthentic to Kerouac. And so he wrote what he called "true story
novels"--books in which the events had really happened to real people. For
legal reasons Kerouac's many publishers insisted on a variety of name 
changes,
along with altered geography and character traits. Thus William Burroughs
appears as Old Bull Lee in <i>On the Road</i>, Frank Carmody in <i>The
Subterraneans</i>, Bull Hubbard in <i>Desolation Angels</i> (1965), and so 
on.
The real-life events of <i>The Subterraneans</i> occurred in New York, but 
the
book is set in San Francisco.<p>

However, <i>The Portable</i>'s bird's-eye view of Kerouac's career belies
rather than affirms the claim that he wrote "one vast book." His novels 
don't
even come close to working as a unified project, and the comparison to 
Proust
must be seen as wishful thinking, or grandiose boast, or just plain 
delusion.
Kerouac was simply not disciplined enough to execute the grand scheme of a
multi-volume work of fictional memoir that coherently depicted an artist's
entire life.<p>
<font size=5>T</font>HOUGH Kerouac always retained the ambition to work 
with the large canvas of
America as a whole, he was a thoroughly apolitical person. His model of 
social
reality was the family--his literal family, with whom he lived at least 
half of
every year, or various substitutes for it. Over and over in his letters we 
see
him fantasizing about some communal venture with his friends, some way of
creating a new familial situation for himself, though he walked out of two
marriages because he found them confining. He repeatedly proposed the idea 
of a
working farm or ranch to Neal and Carolyn Cassady, and in 1956, when 
Buddhism
was his passion and the poet Gary Snyder was his friend, the two men talked
about founding a monastery, or "zendo," where American "bhikkus" (wandering
monks) could stay--conversations dramatized in the novel <i>The Dharma
Bums</i>. But these were always esoteric collectives in Kerouac's
mind--families as clannish as his real family, havens for the initiated, 
not
brotherhoods open to just anyone. Kerouac deplored it when the life led by
Snyder and friends in California's Marin County in the mid-1950s, a life
rhapsodized in <i>The Dharma Bums</i>, became the mass phenomenon of the
counterculture in the 1960s.<p>
And Kerouac was most certainly not ready to meet society as a whole when it
turned collectively to peer at him. After wishing so hard for fame, and
enduring nearly a decade of publishers' rejections, he became famous 
overnight
on September 5, 1957, when Gilbert Millstein, of <i>The New York 
Times</i>,<i>
</i>greeted <i>On the Road </i>with a rave review. A "major novel," 
Millstein
called it, "the most beautifully executed, the clearest and most important
utterance yet made by the generation Kerouac himself named years ago as 
'beat,'
and whose principal avatar he is." Millstein predicted Kerouac's place in
literary history by writing, "Just as, more than any other novel of the
Twenties, <i>The Sun Also Rises </i>came to be regarded as the testament 
of the
Lost Generation, so it seems certain that <i>On the Road </i>will come to 
be
known as that of the Beat Generation."<p>

Millstein had previously given attention to Beat writing in <i>The New York
Times</i>, and he was known to be sympathetic. Few other reviews of <i>On 
the
Road </i>welcomed it in such glowing terms. Indeed, a few days later the 
Sunday
<i>New York Times </i>ran another review of the novel, by David Dempsey, 
that
took a much different tone. Dempsey acknowledged that the book was good
storytelling, but he was scandalized by Kerouac's failure to take a moral
position on the drug use, casual sex, and general outlaw attitude of the
marginal characters depicted in the book. Some reviewers compared the novel
favorably to the work of well-known writers as disparate as Wolfe, 
Whitman, and
Henry Miller, but many commentators thought it encouraged corrupt, depraved
behavior among the restless young.<p>

Kerouac always embodied profound contradictions, and his sense of his own 
work
was no exception. He knew perfectly well that <i>On the Road</i>'s subject
matter--the underground life of hip wanderers--would be its appeal to the
public, but he seems not to have anticipated any moral controversy, or 
that the
mass media would seize upon him personally as "King of the Beats." In 
terms of
personal morality, Kerouac was a rather old-fashioned man who loved wine,
women, and song, and sometimes carried prayer cards in his wallet. He knew 
he
was the hitchhiking stranger looking into middle-class homes lit by blue TV
light, yet he was deeply sentimental about family, and somehow failed to 
grasp
just how far his daily life had drifted from typical middle-class American
experience.<p>

The public controversy boosted book sales even as it turned Kerouac's fame 
into
infamy, and soon he had become the last thing he was prepared to be: the 
public
spokesman for the Beat Generation. As an artist, he didn't want to be part 
of a
mass phenomenon--he wanted to be special. He wanted to be seen as a great
writer, not as the cartoon embodiment of a rebel generation out for kicks,
though he fed that image with cocky behavior and drinking binges. He wasn't
king of anything, and he knew it, but he didn't know how to say no to all 
the
people who wanted to get drunk or stoned or into bed with the hippest 
writer
around, the one-man wild party. Perhaps worst of all, Kerouac was not 
prepared
to see the literary establishment echo the fear and ridicule of the popular
press; most highbrow journals dismissed both his prose and his subject 
matter,
dashing his dream of legitimized artistic glory.<p>

<i>The Portable </i>and <i>Selected Letters </i>show that had Kerouac 
possessed
more self-confidence and character, had he not been so terribly weak in the
flesh, he might have left behind an unassailably great body of work. 
Without
question he had the mysterious combination of qualities it takes to make an
important writer. He was enormously, and strangely, talented. He wrote the
original draft of <i>On the Road </i>in a week, <i>The Dharma Bums </i>in
twelve days, <i>The Subterraneans </i>in three --that last an achievement 
that
staggered even Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs, themselves no 
strangers to
orgiastic writing sessions. His gushed, spouted, roman-candle novels have
reached many people and been admired for many years.<p>

But like good intentions, being talented and even reaching many people 
aren't
everything. F. Scott Fitzgerald, to take that example again, was a far more
disciplined artist than Kerouac, infinitely more confident of himself in
general society, yet he was gone at the age of forty-four, three years shy 
of
<A HREF="http://www.orci.com/personal/jim/pictures/kerouac.html">Kerouac's 
ripe old forty-seven</A>. If you really want to write, or to create any
art, booze and dope will mess you up, though they might provide energy and
inspiration at first. Running from your own identity will mess you up too, 
as
will the attempt to meld yourself with every strong personality you
encounter--another problem Fitzgerald and Kerouac shared. In the end, no 
matter
how we read Jack Kerouac's work, we read his life as a cautionary tale.

	<font size=5>F</font>OR some years now literature has been under siege by "theory" in its various

incarnations: deconstructionism, post-structuralism, Marxism, cultural

criticism, and historicism, among other esoteric isms. Although most of the

reading public continues to approach books and literature in much the same way

that it has for at least a century or two, reading for plot, character, and

meaning, anyone even dimly aware of the tenor of current academic literary

criticism knows that literature has been cut adrift from its ontological

moorings. Plot? A flimsy technical device, used to propagate consumerist cant.

Character? A bourgeois myth, an illusion created to reinforce capitalist

domination. Meaning? No such thing; post-structuralism has shown that owing to

the nature of language, meaning is endlessly deferred along a string of

signifiers. Authors? They don't exist. The author is merely an ideological

construction that artificially limits the proliferation of meanings in the

text. Coherent novels (or "coherent texts," in the academic vernacular) do not

exist in current criticism; every text is shot through with other texts and

with the seeds of its own de(con)struction.<p>



But all this is academic nonsense to the common reader, who still reads to be

entertained, enlightened, and perhaps even morally enlarged. Does "the best

that has been known and thought" consist of nothing more than those works that

make the most effective use of certain formal literary devices? What happened

to Horace's dictum that literature should entertain and instruct? Must

literature be reduced to deluding while indoctrinating (or, worse, to

self-deconstructing)?<p>



The answer to these questions is yes and no. This is nowhere better

demonstrated than in the writing--both fiction and nonfiction--of David Lodge,

a sixty-one-year-old British academic who retired from the University of

Birmingham in 1987. Lodge has published five books of criticism and nine

novels, along with assorted other books. He straddles the worlds of academia

and middlebrow fiction. In Lodge the scholar of the novel we have an academic

who has gone native. And in Lodge the novelist we have, in effect, a mole: he

reports in his nonfiction on the latest in novelistic technique--this while in

his novels pillorying the academy's continuing campaign to create a literature

for professionals only.<p>



Lodge's novels, in both their form and their content, reflect the experience

and the language of the academic. Four of them--<i>The British Museum Is

Falling Down</i> (1965), <i>Changing Places</i> (1975), <i>Small World</i>

(1984), and <i>Nice Work </i>(1988)--feature academics in academic settings: in

them Lodge the novelist parodies the sorts of discourse he produced as Lodge

the professor. In fact, some of the language in the opening paragraph of this

review was pulled from <i>Nice Work </i>and <i>Small World</i>.<i> </i>Lodge's

criticism--in books with titles like <i>Working With Structuralism </i>and

<i>The Modes of Modern Writing</i>--contains both some of the opaque academic

language that one expects of academic criticism today (he can definitely talk

the talk) and nuggets like this one (which perhaps indicate why he took early

retirement from the university): <p>



<blockquote> A lot of academic literary criticism and theory . . . frankly no longer seems

worth the considerable effort of keeping up with it. A vast amount of it is not

. . . a contribution to human knowledge but the demonstration of professional

mastery by translating known facts into more and more arcane 

metalanguages</blockquote><p>



--which means something coming from someone who can actually understand these

metalanguages.<p>



Lodge defends his fiction against theory's assaults by co-opting them,

incorporating the assaults into his stories. He anticipates the commentary of

the academic critic and puts it into the voices of his characters. Let's, the

narrator of <i>Nice Work </i>says, meet<p>



<blockquote>a character who, rather awkwardly for me, doesn't herself believe in the

concept of character. That is to say (a favourite phrase of her own), Robyn

Penrose, Temporary Lecturer in English Literature at the University of

Rummidge, holds that "character" is a bourgeois myth, an illusion created to

reinforce the ideology of capitalism.</blockquote><p>



The narrator goes on in this mode at sufficient length to become unsettling.

Maybe character <i>is </i>an illusion. But then Robyn's views are summarily

(though good-naturedly) deflated.<p>



<blockquote>In practice [these views don't] seem to affect her behaviour very

noticeably--she seems to have ordinary human feelings, ambitions, desires, to

suffer anxieties, frustrations, fears, like anyone else in this imperfect

world, and to have a natural inclination to try and make it a better place. I

shall therefore take the liberty of treating her as a 

character.</blockquote><p>



By such touches Lodge manages to have it both ways. He constructs wonderful

stories and metaphors and narrators in his novels, points out in the same

novels how these stories and metaphors and narrators can all be (in the dread

procedures of academic criticism) deconstructed, unpacked, or historicized, and

then makes fun of this process of deconstruction.<p>

<br>



 <font size=5>O</font>NLY in a Lodge novel would a professor at a conference say, after giving a

speech on narratology, "No, no, my presence [here] would be superfluous . . . I

have performed my narrative function for tonight." His way of telling the other

characters that he's going to bed now is Lodge's way of highlighting the

fictionality of his fiction.<p>



Lodge also plays with form on a larger scale: the last chapter of <i>Changing

Places</i>, for example, collapses form and content into each other.

<i>Changing Places </i>tells the story of what happens when a British and an

American professor exchange positions (and, as it turns out, wives) for a year.

On the surface the plot is fairly conventional: it uses a simple

conceit--taking two characters and dropping them into unfamiliar contexts --to

great comic effect. But Lodge manipulates the structure of <i>Changing Places

</i>to experiment with form, so the novel is more complex than it might seem on

the surface. Each of the six chapters alternates between Philip Swallow, the

British professor, and Morris Zapp, the American (who has many of the

idiosyncrasies of two prominent real-life American critics, Stanley Fish and

Harold Bloom), and each chapter is written in a different style. The last

chapter, called "Ending," is in the form of a screenplay. Its final lines

consist of a kind of extended metafictional joke.<p>



<blockquote>PHILIP: You remember that passage in <i>Northanger Abbey </i>where Jane Austen

says she's afraid that her readers will have guessed that a happy ending is

coming up at any moment.<p>



MORRIS: (<i>nods</i>) Quote, 'Seeing in the tell-tale compression of the pages

before them that we are all hastening together to perfect felicity.' Unquote.<p>



PHILIP: That's it. Well, that's something the novelist can't help giving away,

isn't it, that his book is shortly coming to an end? It may not be a happy

ending nowadays, but he can't disguise the tell-tale compression of the pages.

. . . I mean, mentally you brace yourself for the ending of a novel. As you're

reading, you're aware of the fact that there's only a page or two left in the

book, and you get ready to close it. But with a film there's no way of telling

. . . There's no way of telling which frame is going to be the last. The film

is going along, just as life goes along, people are behaving, doing things,

drinking, talking, and we're watching them, and at any point the director

chooses, without warning, without anything being resolved, or explained, or

wound up, it can just . . . end.<p>



PHILIP shrugs. The camera stops, freezing him in mid-gesture.<p>



THE END</blockquote><p>

<br>



<font size=5>L</font>ODGE'S postmodern machinations whir and grind at a level beneath the surface

of his stories--stories at times so conventional and straightforward (in a way

that the flamboyantly post-modern stories of, say, John Barth or Milan Kundera

are not) that they've escaped the notice of many academic critics, who place a

modernist premium on inaccessibility, and wandered into the realm of popular

fiction. <p>



His best novel may be <i>Small World</i>, a send-up of the world of

international academic conferences, which chronicles the haphazard comings and

goings of a herd of professors (including Morris Zapp and Philip Swallow) all

over the world. The novel has as its formal model the chivalric romance, in

particular the Grail quest as interpreted by Jessie Weston in <i>From Ritual to

Romance </i>(a book that T. S. Eliot used as a major source for <i>The Waste

Land</i>). Lodge hews fairly faithfully to his chivalric analogue. The hero's

name, Persse McGarrigle, is a variation on Percival, the name of the knight who

in most versions of the legend undertakes the Grail quest. Arthur Kingfisher, a

doyen of literary criticism, has become impotent sexually and tapped-out

creatively--just as in the Grail legend the lands of the Fisher King had become

dry and sterile. There are numerous plots and numerous Grails in this

novel--Persse, for example, a young and innocent T. S. Eliot scholar, is

questing for the woman he loves--but the Grail that most of the academics in

the novel are in avid pursuit of is a new chair of literary criticism, which

comes with the highest salary in the profession, tax-free, and which can be

occupied wherever its possessor wishes to reside. Kingfisher chooses the

chair's occupant when Persse, like Percival, asks the appropriate question--one

that cuts brutally to the heart of what academic literary studies are about.<p>



While the Grail quest provides the structural skeleton around which <i>Small

World </i>is built, numerous other models and allusions and formal games dance

at the edges of the text. Lodge uses these allusions and formal tricks

("intertextuality," in the jargon) throughout to deepen the meaning of the

story by lending it mythic resonance and at the same time to sharpen its

satire: giving mythic status to the petty ambitions of these careerist academics

highlights their absurdity. Lodge also uses his formal games to point out the

fictionality of his conceit. When he has a character describe the genre of

romance as "a pre-novelistic kind of narrative . . . full of adventure and

coincidence and surprises and marvels . . . [and] lots of characters who are

lost or enchanted or wandering about looking for each other, or for the Grail,

or something like that," he is doing what he has called in his critical

writings (borrowing from the Russian literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin)"baring of

the device": he is having the character describe the fictional conventions on

which her reality--the reality of <i>Small World</i>--is based.<p>

<br>



<font size=5>L</font>ODGE'S humor and wit have earned him his reputation as a comic novelist. His

novels, especially those published after <i>Small World</i>,<i> </i>have done

well, both popularly and critically. <i>Paradise News</i> (1991), for example,

his next-to-most-recent novel, spent a considerable amount of time on British

best-seller lists, outselling Michael Crichton's <i>Jurassic Park </i>in 1992.

Both <i>Small World </i>and <i>Nice Work </i>were turned into popular and

acclaimed television programs in England. Graham Greene declared himself a

David Lodge fan after the publication of Lodge's early novels (which were

swollen with bile toward the Catholic Church), and Anthony Burgess in 1984

ranked <i>How Far Can You Go?</i> (1980) as one of the best novels published

since the beginning of the Second World War. Lodge has also been short-listed

twice (for <i>Small World </i>and <i>Nice Work</i>) for the Booker Prize. <p>



But he has never actually won the Booker (in 1984 <i>Small World </i>lost out

to Anita Brookner's <i>Hotel du Lac</i>; in 1988 <i>Oscar and Lucinda, </i>by

Peter Carey, beat <i>Nice Work</i>). Has he been runner-up for the award

because he's good but, in the end, not <i>that </i>good? Or is it because, as a

comic novelist, he's not accorded the same respect as "serious" novelists?

Woody Allen has said that comics don't get to eat at the grown-ups' table and

that this has affected the reception of his films. Might a similar syndrome

have affected Lodge's critical reception? Or is it accurate to say, as the

British newspaper <i>The Guardian </i>has, that "ultimately, Lodge's comic view

of life is sustainable only because it doesn't dig very deep"? Some of Lodge's

novels end, certainly, like Shakespearean comedies, with couples improbably

reuniting. But Lodge also uses the comic to gesture meaningfully at the weighty

and profound.<p>



Take <i>Paradise News</i>. At the end of the first chapter the novel's hero,

the skeptical theologian Bernard Walsh, muses that "there was, after all,

something incongruous, even indecent, about using a package holiday to visit a

dying relative"--the package holiday being a trip to Hawaii. A priest who has

lost his faith, Bernard has been living a drab, Spartan life, teaching theology

at a small college. As he helps and comforts his ailing aunt, Ursula, and

enters a relationship with Yolande Miller (whose discordant name, in "yoking

together the exotic and the banal," typifies the novel's incongruities), who

has hit and injured his father with her car, he begins to discover how

resourceful he is, and to become aware of life's manifold possibilities. <p>



Lodge explores the meaning of Bernard's progress in a theology lecture that

Bernard delivers at the end of the novel. What can be salvaged from the

"eschatological wreckage" of traditional religious faith? Bernard asks. In many

ways this is what <i>Paradise News </i>is about. Religious awe at earthly

things and at earthly pleasures, and the wonder that attends the "uncertainty"

of the existence of God, fill the void left by the discrediting of traditional

Christian dogma. (<i>Paradise News </i>is also, of course, about

interpretation, and about the impossibility, after post-structuralism, of a

literary text's having an absolute meaning.) Bernard finds a kind of modest

paradise in these wonders, and he prefers them to the guarantee of heaven.

Whereas Milton undertook in <i>Paradise Lost </i>to justify the ways of God to

man, <i>Paradise News</i>, though it winks slyly at Milton, shows how our

helping and caring for one another will be rewarded in a world where we cannot

even be sure that God has ways. One hopes this view of life can be sustained

outside the comic novel.<p>

<br>



<font size=5>S</font>TILL, if happy endings belong fundamentally to the comic genre, then

<i>Paradise News </i>falls into that category. But in Lodge's latest novel,

<i>Therapy</i>, which is soon to be published in paperback, the comic view of

life is tempered considerably. <p>



<i>Therapy</i>'s hero, Laurence Passmore, known to most as Tubby, is somewhat

fat, more than somewhat balding, and fifty-eight. He is married to Sally, a

linguist, and he has two grown children. He is the writer of a successful

sitcom called <i>The People Next Door</i>, which has been running for five

years and is watched by 13 million people each week. This show has yielded

Tubby a small amount of fame and a large amount of money. Tubby also has a

mistress--albeit a platonic one--named Amy.<p>



Tubby believes he should be happy: "So really you would say that I've got it

made, wouldn't you? I've solved the monogamy problem, which is to say the

monotony problem, without the guilt of infidelity. I have a sexy wife at home

and a platonic mistress in London. What have I got to complain about? I don't

know." He doesn't know. That's just the problem. In addition to a real and

nagging physical ailment, a recurrent sharp pain in his knee, Tubby is plagued

by a malaise of uncertain origins. He doesn't suffer from nightmares, but <p>



<blockquote>nightmares are about the only thing I don't have, in that line. I have

depression, anxiety, panic attacks, night sweats, insomnia, but not nightmares.

. . . [If I did have nightmares] maybe I would get a clue then to what's

the matter with me. I don't mean my knee. I mean my head. My mind. My 

soul.</blockquote><p>



Nearly all Lodge's heroes have some sort of obvious weakness or shortcoming

that becomes almost a defining characteristic: they are short (Victor Wilcox in

<i>Nice Work</i>), fat (Tubby), lapsed priests (Bernard in <i>Paradise

News</i>), sexually bumbling (Persse in <i>Small World </i>and the entire cast

of characters in <i>How Far Can You Go?</i>), or just plain benignly

ineffectual (Philip Swallow in <i>Changing Places</i>, Adam Applebly in <i>The

British Museum Is Falling Down</i>). It is as though Lodge, who in his earlier

novels was somewhat angrily trying to address the frustrating proscriptions of

the Catholic Church through comedy, has abandoned the specific tenets of

Catholicism while retaining at least one of its basic moral principles for his

artistic vision: The meek shall inherit the earth. These short, fat, bumbling

characters usually end up okay, often even better off than they were at the

beginning.<p>



Much of Lodge's comedy stems from the amplification in his characters of our

deepest insecurities: about sex, about our appearance, about our place in the

world. Woody Allen similarly zeroes in on basic human insecurities. But Lodge's

touch is lighter than Allen's, even in <i>Therapy</i>,<i> </i>which has

Allenesque existential preoccupations. Here, in a scene told from the point of

view of Amy, Tubby makes his first attempt at compensating for "lost

philandering" after his wife has left him.<p>



<blockquote>Well, it was lucky I was [drunk], otherwise it would have been just too

embarrassing for words. . . . I got the giggles as soon as I saw Laurence

putting on his knee-support when we were preparing for our <i>siesta</i>. It's

made from some spongy stretch fabric, like they use to make wet-suits, and it's

bright red, with a hole in it for his kneecap to poke through. It looked

particularly funny when he had nothing else on. . . . Apparently he always

wears it when he and Sally have sex. When he put on an elasticated elbow

bandage as well I nearly had hysterics. He explained that he'd had a recurrence

of tennis elbow lately and didn't want to take any chances. I wondered if he

was going to put on anything else, a pair of shin-pads perhaps, or a cycling

helmet. Actually, that wouldn't have been a bad idea, because the bed was so

narrow he was in some danger of falling on the floor during foreplay . . . I

felt like a cross between a hooker and an orthopaedic nurse.</blockquote><p>



Lodge mines the endless array of sexual foibles to extract laughter <i>and

</i>sanity. The humor in this passage bears one of Lodge's trademarks: it is

funny at his characters' expense without sacrificing the warmth and empathy the

reader feels for them.<p>



<i>Therapy </i>doesn't scale the heights of comedy the way some of Lodge's

earlier novels did. This may be because Lodge is most in his element in comic

writing about being an academic and being a Catholic. Indeed, Lodge's first

comic novel, <i>The British Museum Is Falling Down</i>, was about a Catholic

academic. Thinking about how easy sexual life must be for non-Catholics, Adam

Appleby, who is a poor graduate student with three children already, marvels,<p>



<blockquote>How different from his own married state, which Adam symbolised as a small,

over-populated, low-lying island ringed by a crumbling dyke which he and his

wife struggled hopelessly to repair as they kept anxious watch on the surging

sea of fertility that surrounded them.</blockquote><p>



His wife keeps getting pregnant, despite the couple's best efforts at

Catholicism's version of birth control. <p>



They had embarked on marriage with vague notions about the Safe Period and a

hopeful trust in Providence that Adam now found difficult to credit. Clare had

been born nine months after the wedding. Barbara had then consulted a Catholic

doctor who gave her a simple mathematical formula for calculating the Safe

Period--so simple that Dominic was born one year after Clare.<p>



When a fellow graduate student accuses Adam of suffering from a special form of

scholarly neurosis, the inability to distinguish between life and literature,

Adam retorts, "Oh yes I can. Literature is mostly about having sex and not much

about having children. Life is the other way round." <i>The British Museum Is

Falling Down</i> lacks the weight and formal neatness of Lodge's later novels,

but it demonstrates his droll humor and his ability to make us simultaneously

laugh at and feel for his characters.<p>

<br>



<font size=5>T</font>HERE'S no question that in <i>Therapy</i>, superficially a conventional

entertainment, Lodge is up to his old playful gamesmanship, at the same time

baring and concealing the devices that make his fiction work. Consider even his

choice of title. Who exactly is this therapy for? That is, what is the title

referring to? All the therapy that Tubby ("On Mondays I see Roland for

Physiotherapy, on Tuesdays I see Alexandra for Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and

on Fridays I have either aromatherapy or acupuncture. Wednesdays and Thursdays

I'm usually in London, but then I see Amy, which is a sort of therapy too, I

suppose") and the other characters in the novel receive? No doubt. But is Lodge

also offering therapy to us? Probably that, too. After all, the novel's

somewhat sad ending is clearly intended to make us feel better about what

Tubby, in talking about the therapeutic social effect he presumes his sitcom to

have on viewers, calls our "negative equity." Finally, maybe, just maybe, is

this novel therapy for Lodge? Though it is extremely unfashionable, now that

authors are not supposed even to exist, to look in novels for autobiographical

clues, I find it distinctly possible that the novel represents a kind of

extemporized writing therapy or journal writing, meant to assuage his own

midlife angst. (Lodge recently told an interviewer, "In middle age, I've found

myself prone to more depression and anxiety than I can give a rational

explanation for.") Consider the novel's epigram, from Graham Greene: "Writing

is a form of therapy." Consider also the extract from the journal of

S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard that Tubby quotes approvingly: "Only when I write do I

feel well." Still more suggestive, however, is the first line of the novel. It

comes before Tubby's entry dated February 15, 1993, and it reads "Right, here

goes." Is this Tubby getting ready to write his diary? Or is it Lodge getting

ready to improvise Tubby's diary? Now combine all this with the way that Tubby

describes the pigeons outside his window in his first diary entry: "Pure

play--no question. They were just larking about, exercising their agility for

the sheer fun of it." Right away, on page one, Lodge has us wondering, Is this

what <i>he</i> is going to do? Is this novel just writing for the sake of

writing, writing for the sake of therapy? How else would you begin such an

exercise but by saying to yourself, "Right, here goes"?<p>



One final piece of evidence: at the beginning of the novel's concluding section

Tubby muses about the distinctions among writing a novel, writing a script, and

writing a journal. The essential difference, he explains, in a passage that

recalls the end of <i>Changing Places</i>,<i> </i>is "a question of tense."

Whereas a script is all in the present tense, happening <i>now</i>, when you

write something in a book it appears to be all in the past. <p>



<blockquote>Even if you write, "<i>I am writing, I am writing</i>," over and over again,

the act of writing is finished with, out of sight, by the time somebody reads

the result. . . . The special thing about a journal is that the writer doesn't

know where his story is going, he doesn't know how it ends; so it seems to

exist in a kind of continuous present, even though the individual incidents may

be described in the past tense. Novels are written after the fact, or they

pretend to be. The novelist may not have known how his story would end when he

began it, but it always <i>looks </i>as if he did to the 

reader.</blockquote><p>



This is an obvious point, really, but by highlighting its own mechanism, it

casts the novel in a new light. Is <i>Therapy</i>, then, just Lodge's fancy way

of saying "<i>I am writing, I am writing</i>"? His way of diverting himself

from whatever demons plague him? Who is the author of this diary entry, Tubby

or Lodge? Obviously, both are. Tubby in this passage points out that this is

his journal; he couldn't possibly have known where his life was going next as

he wrote it. Lodge, however, is the novelist. He knew where Tubby's life was

going all along. Or did he? <p>



Reading Lodge's critical writing on fiction produces the disconcerting feeling

of being allowed a peek at the bricks and mortar, the sweat and craftsmanship,

that go into the creation of a literary work. Perhaps you would rather not know

how it came to be; you would prefer to entertain the illusion that it appeared

on the earthly plane fully formed. In that case, when Lodge the novelist pulls

back the curtain to reveal the scaffolding and lighting devices in his fiction

as you're reading it, you would probably just as soon close your eyes and

pretend that you haven't noticed. But you would be missing out: Lodge is

simultaneously a playfully postmodern and a plainly conventional comic

novelist, and that, along with his intermingling of form and content, is what

makes him such an interesting writer. Besides, it is reassuring to read the

novels of an academic who still believes in character, in storytelling, and in

meaning. And seeing a novel broken down into its component parts should not be

alarming, because in the end, as Lodge has written, "a novel is a

<i>Gestalt</i> . . . a perceptual pattern or structure possessing qualities as

a whole that cannot be described merely as the sum of its parts." Literature

<i>is </i>far more than an aggregation of technical devices. Even if that's

just what it is. <p>

<font size=5>W</font>ow! The aromatic of a fresh raw habanero
-- I'm talking about an
orange, ripe one -- smells like passion fruit or guavas, apricots and orange
blossoms, all mixed up with green herbs and a piquancy your nose can detect.
All the flowers and fruit come through in the taste as well, along with
sweetness and a tangerine tang -- and a glorious heat that overtakes the front
two-thirds of your mouth and heightens your senses.<p>

     These are <i>not</i> Scotch bonnet peppers, the latter being more
aggressively flavored (though noticeably smaller) and equally hot. The related
Scotch bonnet looks different, too, usually smaller and sunken at the shoulder
with a stem that rises form a nipple-shaped bump.<p>

     A final note about habaneros: we use so little of them in each dish that I
recommend buying a handful when you find them and storing them whole in the
freezer up to 3 months. Frozen ones slice in half easily and taste as good to
me as fresh ones in cooked sauces and even in fresh salsas, where there's so
little chile that the textural difference is hard to notice.<p>

     Stats: An average habanero ranges from light green to bright orange, is
about 1/3 ounce, about 1 1/2 inches long by 1 inch wide at the squared-off but
not sunken shoulder, the lantern-shaped body quickly tapering to a point just
before the end; almost all will be deeply dimpled and the points of some will
look like a nipple.<p>

<blockquote>


 <A 
HREF="http://pathfinder.com/@@ltjwyQYAK*splvfn/curb/Artists/mh.html"><font size=5>M</font>ERLE 
Haggard</A> is a commanding figure in late-twentieth-century American 
popular music, a country-music superstar whose career, documented in the 
new collection <i>Down Every Road</i>, has spanned more than one seismic 
shift in our recent cultural history. <img src="Music.gif" align=left hspace=10 
vspace=10> Long overdue, Capitol Nashville's 
four-disc, hundred-song compilation is one of the few indispensable items 
in the CD-era glut of reissues and commemorative boxed sets.<p>

Before he stiff-armed the counterculture in 1969 with his hippie-baiting 
anthem "Okie From Muskogee," Haggard was on his way to an unlikely 
apotheosis.  <i>Rolling Stone </i>critics lionized him as an auteur and an 
unlettered poet transcending the limits of a trashy genre.  The genre 
itself fascinated hippies.  The Grand Ole Opry, Goo-Goo Clusters, Tammy 
Wynette--wow!  To the children of affluence, this was surreal kitsch, 
exotic yet on native ground.  Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda rode out to 
discover America in <i>Easy Rider</i>.  <A 
HREF="http://www.users.interport.net/~timmu/hag.html">Merle Haggard</A> 
was the son of Dust Bowl refugees and sang about it; he was an ex-con and 
sang about that, too.  "I turned twenty-one in prison / Doin' life without 
parole." So what if the fellow wasn't a murderer?  He was the real 
thing--ten times as real as Bob Dylan, that middle-class renegade.<p>

But the real thing got nasty and bit the counterculture's hand. Whether or not
Haggard wrote "Okie" as a joke (he's never been very clear about this), it
showed the hippies where his heart lay: with the hardhats. With the crackers
who blew Hopper and Fonda away. With white working-class America, not
romanticized &agrave; la Marcuse but in its red, white, and hippie-stomping
blue. With the crowds of crew-cut flag-wavers who cheered Merle on all across
America, in the autumn of 1969: "<i>We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogeeee</i>
. . . "<p>

Recoiling, the longhairs vilified Haggard ("the Spiro Agnew of music," one
critic called him) and then forgot about him. Haggard shrugged and went on his
way, singing for his faithful fans and slowly building what <i>Down Every Road
</i>confirms is country music's greatest body of work since that of Hank
Williams Sr. <p>

Not that he is at the end of the road.  Leading his crack ten-piece band, 
The Strangers, Haggard plied America's highways to play 107 shows last 
year--as charismatic a performer as ever at fifty-nine.  This is poignant, 
because <A HREF="http://kochint.com/kochrecr.html#merle">his records</A> no 
longer climb the country charts.  They hardly even make bottom-rung 
appearances.  Those faithful country-music fans have proved fickle--or, 
rather, they've been swamped by legions of new fans to whom Haggard and his 
still-vital contemporaries Waylon Jennings (fifty-nine), <A 
HREF="http://infolink.runet.edu/~gblackbu/bio.html">Willie Nelson</A> 
(sixty-three), and <A 
HREF="http://www.geocities.com/BourbonStreet/1926/">George Jones</A> and <A 
HREF="http://www.infi.net/~drmellow/country/artists/cash/">Johnny Cash</A> 
(both sixty-four) mean little.  The new fans go for a hygienically improved 
type, a <A 
HREF="http://it.stlawu.edu/~mdoyle/clint/clint2.gif">cowboy-hatted hunk</A> 
tricked out in the trappings of his predecessors--hat, jeans, boots, even a 
southern twang--but singing a very different song.  <P>

<br>


<A 
HREF="http://http.tamu.edu:8000/~pbr1177/merle.html"><font size=5>M</font>ERLE Haggard</A> is 
a man of prismatic creativity, a singer, songwriter, bandleader, guitarist, 
and fiddler--(everything but, as a recent brush with bankruptcy attests, a 
good businessman).  He has written or co-written 346 songs, forty-five more 
than the legendarily prolific Willie Nelson.  As a singer he has sent 
thirty-eight tunes to No.  1 on <i>Billboard</i>'s country chart--more than 
Nelson and Hank Williams Sr.  combined.  He has released sixty-eight 
albums, not counting the bootleg cassettes and CDs one finds on drugstore 
racks.<p>

Haggard's songbook includes remarkably few throwaways. Especially from the
mid-sixties to the mid-eighties he churned out classic after classic. He has
written working-class anthems ("Mama's Hungry Eyes," "Workin' Man Blues," "If
We Make It Through December," "Big City") and prison songs ("Sing Me Back
Home," "Branded Man," "Mama Tried," and the searing "Huntsville," buried until
now on a 1971 album). He has written road songs ("White Line Fever," "Ramblin'
Fever"), jingoistic songs ("Okie From Muskogee," "The Fightin' Side of Me"),
sad love songs ("Silver Wings," "Holding Things Together"), happy love songs
("Living With the Shades Pulled Down"), sad drinking songs ("The Bottle Let Me
Down"), happy drinking songs ("Honky Tonk Night Time Man"), and sad drinking
songs masquerading as happy drinking songs ("Swinging Doors"). He has written
ecology songs ("Winds of Change"), anti-racism songs ("Irma Jackson"),
showbiz-is-hell songs ("Footlights"), and odes to his own truculent,
square-peg-in-a-round-hole individualism ("My Own Kind of Hat"). <p>

When I spoke to Haggard recently, I asked him which song best expressed him. He
thought for a long time. "What came to mind when you said that was the song
called `Leonard.' I wrote it about a friend of mine [the songwriter Tommy
Collins, born Leonard Sipes]. I sometimes marvel at that one. I don't know how
I did it. `Footlights' might describe my situation, or condition, more than any
other song. `White Man Singing the Blues'--lately I've been thinking about how
lucky I was to have written that."<p>

"The poet of the common man," as Haggard is sometimes called, is at bottom an
autobiographer, drawing again and again on his rural blue-collar roots. He
really is<i> </i>an Okie from the greater Muskogee area--or his parents are,
anyway; Merle was born in Oildale, California, near Bakersfield, two years
after the family migrated from Oklahoma. His imagination has remained
working-class. Though he had long left poverty behind when he wrote "If We Make
It Through December," the portrait of a laid-off factory worker rings true: "I
don't mean to hate December / It's meant to be the happy time of year / And my
little girl don't understand / Why Daddy can't afford no Christmas here."<p>

The bedrock emotion in his songs is probably a deep, stoic sadness ("I grew up
in an oil town / But my gusher never came in," he sings in the beautiful elegy
"Kern River"); still, Haggard can also kick up his heels ("Let's Chase Each
Other Around the Room"). The young ex-con's pinched, antisocial bitterness in
"Branded Man" ("I paid the debt I owed them, but they're still not satisfied")
faded with time. Later on there were astonishing moments of open-armed
bonhomie--the sunny prophecy "Rainbow Stew," for instance, with its visions of
world peace and gasless cars and its giddy refrain, "We'll all be drinkin' that
free Bubble Up / And eatin' that rainbow stew!" Haggard's politics are
impossible to pigeonhole. The single he wanted to release right after "Okie"
was "Irma Jackson," an interracial love story. Aghast, Capitol quashed the
idea. Haggard may have been received at Nixon's White House, but that didn't
prevent him from unfondly remembering the man who "lied to us all on TV." In
the end Haggard hews to a sort of right-wing anti-authoritarianism, more
reflexive than reasoned.<p>

<br>

<font size=5>I</font>F his songwriting energy has fallen off lately, Haggard's always-superb
singing has actually risen a notch in quality. He may be the most
sophisticated, self-analytical vocalist country music has ever produced,
schooled in the melismatic style of the fifties star Lefty Frizzell. (Anyone
who considers country music unsophisticated should listen to the first seconds
of Frizzell's "Always Late," in which Haggard's hero teases the title phrase
into more syllables, as smooth as raw oysters, than one can count.)<p>
 
Haggard's early voice was a honeyed tenor that easily melted into falsetto. In
his first hit, "Sing a Sad Song" (1963), he took the opening notes at an easy,
conversational pitch but abruptly floated his voice a full octave up, pulling
the amazed listener with him. His voice has deepened with age. It has come to
resemble <A HREF="http://http.tamu.edu:8000/~pbr1177/icon.gif">his unforgettable face, by turns rounded and jagged</A>--except that the
face is a ruin and the voice a sandblasted gem. Haggard today can sound as
wizened as your grandpa or as youthful as Romeo. He sometimes piles on too many
effects (my least favorite is a back-of-the-throat tenor that makes him sound a
little like Dudley Do-Right), but when he is relaxed, he's pure magic. The
doyens who long ago pronounced Sinatra a genius may not know it, but Haggard
lives in the same neighborhood.<p>

He's also a fine instrumentalist who was bit early and hard by the
guitar-picking bug. He taught himself the fiddle in the early seventies, in
order to play the music of another of his idols, Bob Wills. The encounter with
Wills's "western swing" was epochal for Haggard. He doubled The Strangers'
number to ten, molding the band into a latter-day version of Wills's Texas
Playboys. The Strangers' music grew springy and supple, and Haggard started
calling it "country jazz." In 1980 he became the first country artist to be
featured on the cover of the venerable jazz magazine <i>Down Beat</i>. He has
an improviser's hatred of the rote. "I try very hard to go out there every show
and do at least one thing that the band had no idea I was gonna call for,"
Haggard told me, "It's an adrenaline kick. It keeps me on my toes. It damn sure
keeps them on theirs!" No remark could convey more tellingly the gulf between
Haggard and the stars of nineties country music, whose concerts--sonically
perfect and choreographed down to the hip-wiggle--mime the twinkly perfection
of their videos. In a bizarre flipflop, TV has become the reality, live music
the simulation. <p>

<br>

<font size=5>W</font>HEN Haggard stood in the media glare lit by "Okie," country music was still a
subculture, lampooned by the mainstream when noticed at all. Today country
<i>is</i> the mainstream. In 1970 country records grossed less than $150
million; last year they made more than $2 billion. Country is American record
buyers' second-favorite genre, after rock; its market share, now 16.7 percent,
has doubled since 1990. In radio, country rules. Seventy million Americans
listen to 2,600 country stations--both figures far outstripping the
competition. <A HREF="http://204.96.208.1/services\staff\dawn/GARTHB.HTM">Garth Brooks</A> is the best-selling solo recording artist in
history--bigger than Elvis, bigger than Michael Jackson, and, with 60 million
albums sold, closing in on the Beatles. Garth Brooks?<p>

From its birth, in the 1920s, commercial country music was never simply a rural
genre. It was the soundtrack for one of this century's great diasporas: the
flow of rural white southerners into America's cities. Country softened the
traumas of that move. Right through the sixties, songs like "The Streets of
Baltimore" mirrored the rural southerner's feelings about his displacement,
from elation ("Her heart was filled with laughter / When she saw those city
lights / She said the prettiest place on earth is Baltimore at night") to
defeat ("Now I'm a-goin' back on that same train / That brought me here before
/ While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore"). If the narrator didn't stick
it out, his cousins probably did, and raised families, and left their roots
behind. <p>

What happens when a music outlives its social function? It may die, or it may
live on, changed utterly. Severed from its origins, country is now a series of
free-floating symbols. Cowboy hats and gingham skirts make their wearers
"country"--a lifestyle as opposed to a way of life, the past as product.
Nothing could be easier to market in the nineties. Gutted of its old musical
content (who needed those nasty steel guitars anyway?), thematically spruced up
(light on cheating and drinking songs, heavy on God, love, and the old swimming
hole), country dovetails perfectly with the nostalgia for order which underlies
our current rightward drift. <p>

Nashville's country-music industry is all too eager to shift into overdrive,
welcoming culturally homeless Americans. Country-music record and radio
executives are no more venal now than in the past; it's just that they had less
power when the music was a self-inventing, self-regenerating grassroots
culture. Now they're in charge. In post-regional America power lies with the
programmers of our nationwide pop culture--that big TV set on which country
music is just one channel. Listen to the way Garth Brooks pronounces "standing"
on his hit "Standing Outside the Fire." It's Val-speak, the inflectionless
diction of twentysomethings everywhere. A fiddle tossed into a synthesizer mix
is all it takes to make a record sound "country" now; lots of the stuff is
otherwise indistinguishable from mainstream pop. The beat has sped up, the
drums are "hotter," the lead guitars wail--it's as spontaneous as a Super Bowl
half-time show.<p>

<br>

<font size=5>W</font>HERE does that leave Hag? "These songs they got on the 
radio now," he told me, "my wife says it sounds like they're singin' about 
air. What more can they do to the sonofabitch? They've got it to a 
science. They've got grooming classes where they can turn out Elvis 
Presleys--one a day, I think. They gather up at nine-thirty in the morning, 
they go off in little groups and come back with these prefabricated songs 
about things that never even happened, and it sounds that way. It's so 
refined, it's so perfect, it's so in tune, and there's no feel, there's no 
God-dang soul to it, there's no story, there's no melody, and I just wish 
I could say somethin' else, but that's my opinion."<p>


"To be honest with you," Haggard told me, "I'm so disgusted with what they're
playin' on country, I listen to rock-and-roll stations. Yesterday I listened to
classic rock-and-roll all day long, and I enjoyed it. Or I listen to tapes. I
got my own tapes. Willie Nelson, Bob Wills, Bing Crosby, Milton Brown, George
Benson. That's where I'm at."<p>

To mourn the passing of Haggard's grand sound is not to eulogize the good 
old days for their own sake.  Modernity isn't the problem--<A 
HREF="http://www.nashville.net/~troppo/muslink.htm">Nashville musicians</A> 
like <A 
HREF="http://members.gnn.com/mcity101/NASHVILLEMUSICNETWORK/mark.htm">Mark 
O'Connor</A>, <A HREF="http://rachel.albany.edu/~jc9334/bela2.html">Bela 
Fleck</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.well.com/user/wellvis/douglas.html">Jerry Douglas</A> are coming up with dazzling blends of country 
and other styles, postmodern collisions that in the right hands produce 
art.  Nor am I making a plea for a return to some sort of old-time purity.  
Authenticity was never a criterion in country music--not since Jimmie 
Rodgers, a Mississippi boy, donned cowboy gear.  The only criterion that 
applies is creativity: Is it given room?  Is it encouraged?  The answer, in 
this case, is a resounding no.  <p>

The usual corporate heads' refrain--"We're just giving them what they want"--is
disingenuous. Never mind the oatmeal the big labels do produce. By <i>not
</i>producing--that is, by filtering out a whole rainbow of
artists--country-music labels and radio stations hinder the public's ability to
choose. Pat McLaughlin, Marty Brown, and Kelly Willis are a few of the talented
artists you'll seldom hear on mainstream country radio. As for Haggard, his
last No. 1 song, "Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Star," was in 1987. His last chart
appearance came when "In My Next Life" crept to No. 58 in 1994 and then sank.
<p>

This past spring, just before <i>Down Every Road </i>came out, Haggard released
<i>1996</i>, his sixty-eighth album. KNIX, a country station in Phoenix,
Arizona, played the first single, "Truck Driver's Blues," during a
Friday-afternoon rush hour, and got a flurry of phone calls in response. The
news put Haggard in a good mood through the middle of the following week. "They
went bonkers!" he shouted at me over the phone. "I understand it's actin' like
a complete runaway!" <p>

It never made the charts. I wasn't holding my breath anyway. The song I kept
hearing behind Haggard's jacked-up mood was not "Truck Driver's Blues" but one
he wrote a few years back:<p>

een to Florida lately? You may not realize it, but you have seen 
the future--America's future, about two decades from now. The gray 
wave of senior citizens that fills the state's streets, beaches, parks, 
hotels, shopping malls, hospitals, Social Security offices, and senior 
centers is, of course, an anomaly created by our long tradition of 
retiring to Florida. <A

early in the next century a figure like that won't be exceptional. By 2025

When we consider the great demographic shift that will shape our national 
future over the next fifty years, we are speaking not of a mere transition 
but of a genuine transformation. Just fifteen years from now the first 
batch of Baby Boomers will hit sixty-five, bringing changes--economic, 
political, social, cultural, and ethical--that will transform American 
society. This transformation will challenge the very core of our national 
psyche, which has always been predicated on fresh beginnings, childlike 
optimism, and aspiring new generations. How we cope with the cultural 
dimensions of this challenge I will leave to others--to sociologists, 
political scientists, historians, and philosophers. I am none of these. I 
am a businessman who has long participated in public debates over the 
political economy of rising living standards. What concerns me most 
about 
<img src="./Cover1.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="">
America's coming demographic transformation is simply this: on our present 
course we won't be able to afford it.<p>
To provide for the largest generation of seniors in history while 
simultaneously investing in education and opportunity for the youth of the 
twenty-first century, we must reject the prevailing "entitlement ethic" 
and return to our former "endowment ethic," which generated America's high 
savings, high growth, and rising living standards in the past. Endowment 
implies "stewardship"--the acceptance of responsibility for the future 
of an institution. But given our current emphasis on individual 
self-fulfillment, we must, in addition to endowing the future of our 
nation and its institutions, endow our individual futures and those of our 
children, because no one else is going to do it for us. What I am talking 
about is <I>self-endowment</I>. <P>
"Hope I die before I get old," <A 
HREF="http://www.rockhall.com/media/sounds/ra/who.ram">The Who</A> sang in 
their classic sixties 
anthem, "My Generation." That statement, like so many slogans of the Baby 
Boomers' youth culture, was wishful thinking. The generation that once 
warned "Don't trust anyone over thirty" is now passing fifty.<P>
The real question is, Will America grow up before it grows old? Will we 
make the needed transformation early, intelligently, and humanely, or 
procrastinate until delay exacts a huge price from those least able to 
afford it--and confronts us with an economic and political crisis to 
which there is no longer a win-win solution?<P><br>
<CENTER><b>Demographics is Destiny</b><P>
</CENTER>Within the next fifteen years the huge generation of <A 
HREF="http://foghorn.usfca.edu/archives/fall.95/f09/news/boomers.html">Baby 

Boomers,</A> whose parents brought them into the world with such optimism, 
will begin to retire. As they do, they will expect the munificent array of 
"entitlements" that were guaranteed (again with such optimism) to every 
retiring American with no anticipation of the ever-growing length of 
retirement as life expectancy increases or the ever-rising expectations of 
independence, affluence, health, and comfort of life in retirement. But 
consider who is expected to pay for this late-in-life consumption: 
the 

relatively small "bust" generation in whose productive capacity we have 
failed to invest.  Neither the founders of <A 
HREF="http://www.ssa.gov/history/history.html">Social Security sixty years 
ago</A> nor the founders of Medicare thirty years ago imagined the 
demographic shape of America that will unfold over the next several 
decades.<P> Ponder the following:<P><ul> <li> With 76 million members, the 
Baby Boom generation is more than half again as large as the previous 
generation.  To get some idea of how much the number of seniors could grow 
by the time the youngest Baby Boomers turn seventy, think of the entire 
population of California and the New England states combined.  Or think of 
it this way: the number of Social Security beneficiaries will at least 
double by the year 2040.<P> <li> In 1900 only one in twenty-five Americans 
was over sixty-five.  The vast majority of these people were completely 
self-supporting or supported by their families.  By 2040 one out of every 
four or five Americans will be over sixty-five, and the vast majority will 
be supported to some degree by government entitlements.<P> <li> In 1960 
there were 5.1 taxpaying workers to support each Social Security 
beneficiary.  Today there are 3.3.  By 2040 there will be no more than 
2.0--and perhaps as few as 1.6.  <P> <li> The number of "young old" 
(sixty-five to sixty-nine) will roughly double over the next half century, 
but the number of "old old" (eighty-five and over) is expected to triple or 
quadruple--adding the equivalent of an entire New York City of 
over-eighty-five-year-olds to the population.  Nearly three quarters of 
those over eighty-five will be single, divorced, or widowed--the groups 
most likely to need extensive government assistance.  <P> <li> In 1970 
children under five outnumbered Americans aged eighty-five and over by 
twelve to one.  By 2040 the number of old old will equal the number of 
preschool children, according to some forecasts.<P> <li> The extraordinary 
growth of the old old population will add especially to federal health 
costs.  This is because the average annual medical-care bill rises along a 
steep curve for older age groups.  The ratio of Medicare and Medicaid 
spending on the old old to spending on the young old is about 2.5 to 1.  
<P> <li> In 2030 only about 15 percent of the over-sixty-five population 
will be nonwhite.  But about 25 percent of younger Americans will be 
nonwhite.  This will create a potentially explosive situation in which 
largely white senior Boomers will be increasingly reliant on overtaxed 
minority workers.<P> <li> In order to provide the same average number of 
years of retirement benefits in 2030 that were contemplated when Social 
Security was set up, in the 1930s, the retirement age would have to be 
raised from sixty-five to seventy-four by 2030.  But this 
projection--daunting as it is--assumes that future gains in longevity will 
slow as average life expectancy approaches the supposed "natural limit" to 
the human life-span.  Many experts now question whether such a limit really 
exists.  Summing up research at the National Institute on Aging, the 
demographer James Vaupel goes so far as to suggest that we are now on the 
threshold of a "new paradigm of aging," in which the <I>average</I> life 
expectancy could reach 100 or more.<P></ul> Of course, the United States is 
not the only country facing an <A 
HREF="http://21net.com/online/agewave.htm">"age wave."</A> Indeed, the age 
waves in most industrial countries are approaching faster than ours, 
and--to judge by official projections--could have an even worse impact on 
their countries' economies and public budgets.  But these <A 
HREF="gopher://s01dac9.ssa.gov:70/11/K-Statistical_Data_and_Abstracts/G-Social_Security_Programs_Throughout_the_World./C-COUNTRIES">other 
countries</A> enjoy long-term defenses that we lack.  Unlike the United 
States, most can actually budget their public spending on health care, and 
so have much greater control over this potentially explosive dimension of 
senior dependency.  Unlike the United States, most generally tax public 
benefits as they do any other income.  And unlike the United States, most 
have fairly healthy household savings rates (generally well over 10 percent 
of disposable income, as compared with about five percent here), and so can 
absorb public-sector deficits much better than we can.<P> Most important, 
unlike the United States, these other countries are unencumbered by the 
illusion that their people have some sort of inalienable right to live the 
last third of their adult lives in subsidized leisure.  In other countries 
what government gives can be taken back if doing so is deemed to be in the 
public's long-term interest.  In 1986, when Japan enacted a major reduction 
in future pension benefits, the Ministry of Health and Welfare issued a 
concise justification that cited "equity between the generations." Few if 
any objections were heard.  In a statement issued the day he assumed 
office, Japan's new Prime Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, referred to the 
"imminent arrival of our Aging Society" as a priority imperative.  Citing 
much <A HREF="http://www.l.chiba-u.ac.jp/NGO/4.html">longer life-spans and 
a much reduced fertility rate,</A> he told the Diet in his opening speech 
that Japan would have to "overhaul those social arrangements premised upon 
a life-span of twoscore and ten to suit our new expected life-span of 
fourscore." Do we recall any American President ever making such a 
statement at <I>any </I>point in his term, let alone in the equivalent of 
an inaugural address?  <P> Australia has made employee pensions mandatory, 
increasing coverage from under 40 percent to nearly 90 percent of the work 
force.  Iceland has means-tested its social-insurance system.  Germany has 
enacted, and France, Sweden, Italy, and the United Kingdom are debating, 
increases in the retirement age.  Some of these changes have provoked 
fierce controversy--or even widespread protest, as happened in France last 
winter.  But the disagreement is almost always over how best to allocate 
public resources.  No one questions that government has the right to reduce 
benefits.<P> Even many developing countries with populations still much 
younger than our own are preparing for their demographic future with 
astonishing resolution.  In South Korea the household savings rate runs at 
about 35 percent; "Working to make a better life for the next generation" 
is a typical company motto.  Account balances in Singapore's Central 
Provident Fund--the country's mandatory pension-savings system--now total 
nearly three quarters of GDP.  In Chile the average worker owns $21,000 
worth of assets in the fifteen-year-old national funded retirement 
system--a sum about four times the average annual Chilean wage.  Argentina, 
Peru, and Colombia are following Chile's lead and setting up funded systems 
of their own.  Here, nothing has been saved in any national retirement 
system for any worker to own.<P><br> <CENTER><b>Unsustainable 
Promises</b><P> </CENTER>The economist--and sometime humorist--Herbert 
Stein once said, "If something is unsustainable, it tends to stop." Or, as 
the old adage advises, "If your horse dies, we suggest you dismount."<P> We 
cannot sustain the unsustainable.  Nor can we finance the unfinanceable.  
By 2013, when Baby Boomers will be retiring en masse, the annual surplus of 
Social Security tax revenues over outlays will turn negative.  By 2030, 
when all the Boomers will have reached sixty-five, Social Security alone 
will be running an <I>annual </I>cash deficit of $766 billion.  If Medicare 
Hospital Insurance is included, and if both programs continue according to 
current law, the combined cash deficit that year will be $1.7 trillion.  
The horse, in other words, will be quite dead.  By 2040 the deficit will 
probably hit $3.2 trillion, and by 2050, $5.7 trillion.  Even discounting 
inflation, the deficit that year for these two senior programs will come to 
approximately $700 <I>billion</I>--four times the size of the entire 1996 
federal deficit.  Long before that time we will have had no choice but to 
dismount.  <P> Wall Street has yet to react to these obviously 
unfinanceable numbers.  When will it?  Since financial markets try to 
anticipate events, the reaction will surely come years before the first 
Boomers start retiring on Social Security, in 2008.  How severe will the 
reaction be?  Should the markets conclude that America has lost any chance 
to deal with this challenge in advance, we will almost certainly see a 
full-scale economic emergency as interest rates roar into outer space.<P> 
Apologists for the status quo dismiss these numbers as "mere projections." 
So let me emphasize that the numbers I have used for Social Security and 
Medicare are <A 
HREF="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/govdocs/green/sec_3.html"><I>official 
</I>projections,</A> calculated by federal actuaries and economists working 
for the Social Security and Health Care Financing Administrations.  The 
same experts also calculate an alternate and much worse "high-cost" 
projection, which has historically proved to be more accurate than the 
forecasts I have used here.  Moreover, the retirement and medical-care 
needs of the Boomer generation are by no means hypothetical.  The Social 
Security Administration's former chief actuary A.  Haeworth Robertson 
points out that fully 96 percent of senior benefits payable over the next 
seventy-five years will go to people who are already alive (and therefore 
countable) today.<P> Well, say the skeptics, if we can't borrow trillions 
of dollars, maybe we can raise taxes a bit and muddle through.  But this 
isn't a viable option either.  Let's start with the political fact that 
both parties in Washington are currently hawking a tax <I>cut</I>, though 
they disagree about its size.  A tax increase is unmentionable.  Then 
consider the magnitude of the tax increases we would need.  By 2040 the 
cost of Social Security as a share of worker payroll is expected to rise 
from today's 11.5 percent to 17 or 22 percent--depending on whether you 
accept the official or the high-cost projection.  Add both parts of 
Medicare, which currently cost the equivalent of 5.3 percent of payroll but 
are growing so rapidly that they will eventually overtake and surpass 
Social Security in size, and we're talking about 35 to 55 percent of every 
worker's paycheck before we even start to pay for the rest of what 
government does.<P> Obviously, tax increases of this size would destroy the 
economy.  More to the point, they would kill the taxpayers.  There is also 
the interesting question of whether American taxpayers could be expected to 
comply with them.  The experience of runaway pension systems in Latin 
America and Eastern Europe teaches us that when payroll taxes begin even to 
approach these levels, tax evasion becomes widespread and much of the 
economy moves into the tax-exempt "gray market." In other words, it may be 
impossible to fund the future cost of our current benefit promises no 
matter how willing we are to legislate higher tax rates.<P> The <A 
HREF="http://www.frc.org/heritage/commentary/op-mw1.html">senior lobby</A> 
asserts that whatever the economic consequences, future American workers 
are duty-bound to fulfill their side of an ill-defined "contract between 
generations." Yet one group's "earned right" to a benefit is another 
group's "unearned obligation" to pay a tax.  It is to this second group 
that our children and grandchildren belong.  Understandably, they are 
suspicious of a binding "contract" to which they never agreed.  <A 
HREF="http://www.thirdmil.org/twocents/twocents.shtml">According to a 1994 
poll, Americans under thirty-five are much more likely to believe in UFOs 
than to believe that they'll ever receive Social Security benefits.</A><P> 
There's an old adage about robbing Peter to pay Paul.  In the entitlement 
shell game we're proposing to rob Peter Jr.  to pay Peter Sr.--even when 
the Peter Sr.  in question may not need the money.  In fact, Peter Jr.  is 
already paying plenty.  Because so much of Social Security is tax-free (and 
because retirees no longer pay FICA taxes), a typical retired couple on 
Social Security in 1994 with $30,000 in total cash income paid, on average, 
only $790 in federal taxes.  Meanwhile, their son and daughter-in-law, 
struggling to raise a child on the same income, had a total federal tax 
burden of $7,035, if you include both the FICA tax they paid and that paid 
by their employers.  No other industrial nation tilts its tax system away 
from the elderly--or tilts its benefits system toward the elderly--as much 
as the United States does.<P> The present system's true believers dress up 
Social Security and Medicare in the reassuring rhetoric of "insurance" and 
"pensions" and claim that beneficiaries are only getting back what they 
paid in.  They're wrong.  The majority of today's beneficiaries are getting 
back <I>far more </I>than they ever paid in FICA contributions: given an 
average life expectancy, the average one-earner couple retiring today will 
get about $123,000 more out of Social Security than the average earner and 
his or her employers ever paid into it, plus interest.  Omit the employer's 
contribution and calculate only the payback on the personal taxes paid by 
the employee, and the windfall rises to $173,000.  With Medicare thrown in 
it rises to nearly $310,000, much of that tax-free.  These are not "earned 
benefits" but unearned windfalls that our children will have to pay for and 
certainly will never enjoy themselves.  <P> Moreover, since FICA 
contributions have never been saved by the federal government, the point is 
moot: regardless of what a worker paid in, the <A 
HREF="http://www.panix.com/~stern/ss/ss_params.html">federal trust 
funds</A> now possess on that worker's behalf nothing but claims on future 
taxpayers.  The term "trust fund" may suggest a vault in which one's Social 
Security taxes are stacked up, to be paid out later.  But the Social 
Security "trust fund" is the ultimate fiscal oxymoron.  Its "assets," which 
we are told will keep the system "solvent" until 2030, consist of nothing 
more than Treasury IOUs--claims against future generations.  When it comes 
time to redeem these claims and the interest they have accumulated, where 
will the Treasury find the cash?  Either by borrowing from the public or by 
raising taxes.  Either way, absent any policy change future taxpayers will 
have to pay again for today's Social Security "surplus."<P> If the Social 
Security and Medicare balance sheets were evaluated according to 
private-sector accounting standards, both would be declared disastrously 
insolvent.  How disastrously?  Consider that the federal government has 
already promised to today's adults $8.3 trillion in future Social Security 
benefits beyond the value of the taxes they have paid to date--a figure 
more than 250 times as great as the much-decried "unfunded liabilities" of 
<I>all</I> private-sector pension plans in America!  If federal law 
required Congress to fund Social Security the way private pensions must be 
funded, the annual federal deficit would instantly rise by some $675 
billion.  Add in our lavish and unfunded federal-employee pensions and the 
deficit would rise by $800 billion.  Add in Medicare and it would rise by 
more than $1 trillion.  If private-sector executives ran their pension 
systems this way, they would be thrown in jail for wholesale violation of 
federal pension-plan regulations.  <P> Meanwhile, Congress has attempted to 
ban what policy wonks call "unfunded mandates"--federal laws that impose 
costs on the states without providing funding for them.  That's fine--but 
worrying about such mandates while ignoring Social Security and Medicare is 
like mistaking Woody Allen for Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Social Security and 
Medicare are <I>the mother of all unfunded mandates</I>.<P> It's time to 
face up to the fact that trust-fund accounting is a hoax, that Social 
Security is in fact a pay-as-you-go system.  Payroll taxes go directly to 
today's beneficiaries; benefits come directly from today's workers.  Since 
FICA is a tax, and tax revenues are fungible, any annual surplus of FICA 
taxes over benefits is used to cover other government spending.  A 
trust-fund ledger for such transfers is a waste of time.  Does it really 
help anyone to know that Social Security is a bit richer and the Treasury 
is a bit poorer?  Given the apparent congressional appetite for 
constitutional amendments, why not consider one banning government trust 
funds?<P> As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has summed it up, the 
only bottom line that really counts is government's total borrowing balance 
with the public--otherwise known as the annual consolidated budget deficit 
or budget surplus.  Transferring IOUs from the right pocket to the left 
pocket does nothing to bridge Social Security's and Medicare's enormous 
funding shortfall.  <P> Along with this melancholy list of fiscal 
unsustainables we should consider some troubling moral unsustainables.  
Social Security was established to protect the elderly from indigence late 
in life--to prevent a "poverty-ridden old age,"in the words of Franklin D.  
Roosevelt.  If we allow it to go bankrupt by paying benefits to 
middle-class and affluent Americans, many of whom can live well enough 
without these benefits, what will happen to those who really need them?  
Among Social Security recipients whose incomes are under $20,000, Social 
Security accounts for <I>more than half </I>of the total.  In spite of this 
sobering dependence, many political leaders imply by their inaction that 
it's fine to wait until trillion-dollar deficits have devastated our 
economy, and then slash benefits at the last minute.  By doing so we would 
then deprive Americans at all income levels of the chance to plan for their 
futures.  Millions of lower-income beneficiaries would be stranded in what 
might be called a demographic Depression, as the safety net that Social 
Security was enacted to provide suddenly vanished.  Future historians may 
record that Social Security's "defenders" were the ones who most wanted to 
exempt the program from a balanced-budget amendment and thus from gradual 
and timely reform.  <P> Paul Tsongas likes to say, "It's not enough for our 
children to love us.  We should want them to respect us." When our children 
look into the Social Security trust fund and find nothing there but IOUs 
with their own names listed as payers, they will surely wonder how we could 
have treated them so shabbily.  <P><br> <CENTER><b>The Inescapable <br> 
Bottom Line</b><P> </CENTER>Notwithstanding its strengths, real and 
imagined, the U.S.  economy since the early 1970s has failed at what 
matters most: <I>raising productivity</I>.  Why should the average American 
care about such a seemingly abstract concept?  Because working longer 
hours--or putting everyone's spouse (or child) to work--is not the way to 
raise living standards.  A higher standard of living means producing more 
while working the same or a lesser number of hours--in other words, being 
more productive.  Only thus can real (after inflation) hourly compensation 
and take-home pay rise.  The astute economist Paul Krugman once summed it 
up this way: "Productivity isn't everything, but in the long run it is 
almost everything.  A country's ability to improve its standard of living 
over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per 
worker."<P> Since the early 1970s real national income per full-time worker 
(as calculated by the Commerce Department) has grown by approximately 0.4 
percent a year.  Total worker compensation has grown at about the same 
meager pace.  This rate of growth is so low that a debate rages among 
economists over whether--after accounting for inflation and the rising 
costs of employer-paid health care--the typical U.S.  worker has seen any 
perceptible wage growth since 1973.<P> We can no longer ignore what 
economists from Adam Smith to Karl Marx to Alfred Marshall to John Maynard 
Keynes to Paul Samuelson have insisted is the bottom line: sustained 
productivity growth requires investment, and no country can sustain high 
rates of investment without saving.  These economists all understood that 
productivity growth depends on many underlying conditions, such as 
technological innovation and efficient markets, but they all agreed that 
capital accumulation is essential to productivity growth--and is, moreover, 
the one condition over which society can exercise direct control.  Few 
experts disagree, especially when "capital" is defined, as many economists 
define it, to include such intangible collective investments as 
infrastructure, research, education, and training.  Yet we now face public 
budgets strained to the breaking point by the costs of demographic aging, 
which will crowd out all forms of capital accumulation--private and public, 
material and human.  Without fundamental policy reform a graying America 
cannot be a saving America.<P> But thrift is precisely what we've 
forgotten.  From an average of 8.1 percent of GDP in the 1960s, the net 
national savings rate dipped to 7.2 percent in the 1970s and then plunged 
to 3.9 percent in the 1980s and to 2.3 percent thus far in the 1990s.  Net 
domestic investment has fallen in tandem, from 7.3 percent of GDP in the 
1960s to 3.5 percent in the 1990s--a decline that would have been much 
steeper if we had not switched from investing abroad to borrowing 
abroad.<P> Our structural deficits drain our already shallow pool of 
private savings--and hence crowd out private investment.  To the extent 
that we try to control these deficits by reducing "discretionary" federal 
spending (a category that includes most future-oriented programs), they 
also crowd out public investment.  Out of every nondefense dollar the 
federal government now spends, only about five cents builds tangible things 
that remain after the fiscal year is over.  Recently a General Accounting 
Office study suggested that we must invest $112 billion to bring the 
infrastructure of schools back to acceptable levels.  But where can we find 
such a sum when entitlements and interest on old debts crowd out everything 
else?  <P> Long before the Boomers reach retirement age, we're preparing to 
cut everything from Head Start and school lunches to rapid transit and 
space shuttles in order to pay the rising cost of senior entitlements.  
Despite the radical rhetoric in Washington, the recent budget plans I have 
seen don't reverse but accelerate our current fiscal trajectory.  Each of 
them proposes to slash appropriated domestic spending in real dollars while 
only gently restraining the growth in senior entitlements.  Even in 
Congress's plan senior benefits in 2002 would consume still another record 
share of the budget--nearly 50 percent of noninterest outlays, up from 40 
percent today and just 17 percent in 1965.  This is in a benign demographic 
period, when the relatively small Depression generation (born before VJ 
Day) is still retiring and the relatively large Boomer generation (born 
after 1945) is still working and paying taxes.  And remember: this is the 
<I>Republican</I> plan, widely attacked as a "declaration of war" on 
America's seniors.<P> To break out of this slow-growth, low-investment 
cycle we must set a higher productivity goal and then dedicate the 
resources required to meet it.  A sensible objective would be to increase 
the rate of growth in real per-worker national income by a percentage 
point, from the post-1973 average of 0.4 to about 1.5 percent a year.  Even 
this substantial increase would not equal American growth rates of the 
1950s and 1960s, or match Japan's record during the 1970s and 1980s.  But 
it would come close to returning U.S.  productivity growth to its average 
rate over the past century--and it would bring growth close to the rates of 
most of our European competitors.  If we raise productivity to 1.5 percent, 
twenty years from now national income per worker would be nearly $10,000 
higher in today's dollars, and federal revenues (at the same tax rates) 
would be nearly $400 billion higher, than will be the case if we continue 
on our current course.<P> Conventional economic theory suggests that this 
ambitious goal requires a shift of six to eight percent of GDP from 
consumption to savings, giving us a long-term savings and investment rate 
of about 10 percent of GDP.  But where will these extra savings--an average 
of at least $4,500 per U.S.  household annually--come from?  About a third 
can be financed by balancing the federal budget and keeping it balanced.  
The rest will have to come from greater private saving.<P><br> 
<CENTER><b>America's Savings Gap</b><P> </CENTER>Thus we come to what we 
Americans as individuals can and must do for ourselves and the 
nation--ichthyology from the standpoint of the fish.  There are four main 
sources of income for those over the age of sixty-five: continued 
employment, government benefits, private pension income, and accumulated 
personal savings.  As we shall see, the adequacy of each of these sources 
is uncertain.  <P> When it comes to our retirement plans, we are a nation 
in denial.  About nine out of ten Boomers say they want to retire at or 
before age sixty-five (about six out of ten before age sixty).  More than 
two thirds say they will be able to live "where they want" and live 
"comfortably" throughout their retirement years.  A stunning 71 percent 
expect to maintain in retirement a standard of living the same as or better 
than what they enjoyed during their working years.  <P> Yet probe them more 
deeply about their retirement dreams, and most Boomers admit that they are 
terrified that neither they nor their government is saving enough.  Some 
two thirds confess that they've never even calculated how much they need to 
save for their retirement, and an amazing 86 percent acknowledge that 
"future retirees will face a personal financial crisis 20 years from now." 
Yet at the same time, they do not expect or even want much from government.  
Nearly nine out of ten Boomers agree that "the government has made 
financial promises to [their] generation that it will not be able to keep." 
For every Boomer who says that government should shoulder the "main 
responsibility for providing retirement income," five say that individuals 
should.  They will very likely get their wish.  From all the numbers we 
have seen, it is obvious that government retirement benefits (mainly Social 
Security, <A HREF="http://the-tech.mit.edu/V116/N1/medicare.1w.html">Medicare</A>, and 
Medicaid) are likely to be severely reduced by the time most Boomers 
retire.<P> What could take their place?  Thirty years ago experts hoped 
that private pensions would become a universal supplement to Social 
Security.  Such hopes never panned out.  Today less than half of all U.S.  
private-sector workers are covered by pensions.  Overall coverage has been 
flat since the early 1970s, and in recent years coverage has actually 
dropped sharply for younger men.  This stems from long-term changes in the 
work force and in the nature of work--part-time work, working at home, 
multiple careers.  Rates of pension coverage have always been highest for 
full-time career jobs, unionized jobs, and jobs in government and large 
corporations--in short, for jobs that are becoming increasingly scarce.  As 
for Americans lucky enough to have pensions, they will be surprised, if not 
seriously disappointed, by how little their plans have set aside for them: 
the typical defined-benefit pension plan for average-earning workers with 
thirty years of service replaces just one third of pre-retirement 
earnings--an amount that is not indexed for inflation.<P> Clearly, retiring 
Boomers will have to rely heavily on the remaining source of retirement 
income: private savings apart from pensions.  But this source may be the 
most uncertain of all, for it is questionable whether the average American 
is saving <I>anything </I>on his own: what one household saves in a bank 
account or a nonpension mutual fund scarcely offsets what another household 
borrows.  Whenever the stock market or housing prices rise, many households 
may feel that they're saving enough.  But our aggregate personal-savings 
rate, except for pensions, is now barely positive.<P> Many have argued that 
the current bust is attributable to the passage of so many Baby Boomers 
through the years of household formation, and that saving will turn up 
again as Boomers reach the traditionally high-saving middle years.  But for 
this explanation to be valid, the personal-savings rate should have 
bottomed out by the mid-1980s--and climbed back again.  Many Boomers have 
already entered the traditionally peak saving years.  But the savings 
decline persists, contrary to predictions of a demographic reversal.<P> In 
1992, according to the Federal Reserve Board, 43 percent of U.S.  families 
spent more than their income; only 30 percent accumulated assets for 
long-term saving.  In 1993, according to a Merrill Lynch analysis of Census 
Bureau data, half of all families had less than $1,000 in net financial 
assets--a figure that had not risen over the previous decade, even in 
nominal dollars.  Among adults in their late fifties, the age at which 
workers are staring directly at retirement, median savings are still shy of 
$10,000.  Even optimists admit that a bleak future awaits the approximately 
one third of all Boomers who are expected neither to accumulate financial 
assets nor to receive a private pension.  <P> Ironically, the Baby Boom is 
the best-educated, most sophisticated, most well-traveled generation in our 
history.  This irony provides still another illustration of the depth of 
our denial.  <P> B.  Douglas Bernheim, of Stanford University, concludes 
that Boomers on average must <I>triple</I> their current saving if they 
want to enjoy an undiminished living standard in retirement.  And if one 
assumes a 35 percent reduction in Social Security benefits (which seems 
more than likely if not inevitable), then Boomers will have to 
<I>quintuple</I> their saving.  A recent study by the Committee for 
Economic Development, <I>Who Will Pay for Your Retirement?  The Looming 
Crisis</I>, comes to a similarly stark conclusion.  <P> <img 
src="./Cover2.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 alt=""> If it's true 
that the promise of late-in-life government benefits helped to suppress 
private savings in the past, maybe the growing expectation of cuts in 
government benefits will help to boost private savings in the future.  
Though economic theorists debate the point, people do take government 
subsidies into account when deciding how much to save.  By thirteen to one, 
households say that they would save more if they knew that future Social 
Security benefits were going to be cut.<P> Finally there is the prospect of 
inheritance, that magic cure-all for any generation's retirement worries.  
In recent years Boomers have been cheered by a spate of upbeat stories 
about the "$10 trillion inheritance boom" that today's affluent seniors are 
expected to pass on.  These Boomers may not have noticed the bumper 
stickers one sees in resort areas frequented by seniors: I'M SPENDING MY 
CHILDREN'S INHERITANCE.  But even if the hoped-for hand-off takes place, 
there's a problem.  Because this wealth is highly concentrated among 
relatively few families (what Donald Trump calls the "Lucky Sperm Club"), 
bequests may <I>average </I>as much as $90,000 per Boomer but will amount 
to only about $30,000 for the median Boomer.  Muffy and Duffy will do fine, 
but for most of this generation the typical inheritance will just about 
cover the costs of settling Dad's estate and pay off a few lingering 
medical bills.<P> Dan Yankelovich, the dean of American opinion surveyors, 
has wisely said that our collective denial is not due to emotional or moral 
pathology.  Rather, it is a case of "cognitive denial,"by which he means a 
failure to make connections between how we prefer to see reality and what 
reality actually is.  Clearly, this denial is manifest at the national 
level and<I> </I>at the personal level.<P><br> <CENTER><b>Praying for 
Productivity and<br> Other Good Things</b><P> </CENTER> Are there any 
favorable trends under way that might moderate these bleak forecasts?  
Perhaps.  But there is less to them than meets the eye.  First, consider 
productivity growth, which determines real wage growth and hence tomorrow's 
tax base.  Those who preach that high tech will bail us out and that we can 
avoid saving and investing our way back to economic growth tell us not to 
worry: we're in the midst of a productivity revolution.  But we have good 
reason to worry.  For one thing, after the Commerce Department recently 
updated its methodology, it became clear that the much-touted productivity 
gains of the 1990s are just about typical of earlier business-cycle 
recoveries over the past twenty-five years.  For another, the Social 
Security Administration's best estimate of future deficits presupposes a 
permanent one-third improvement in productivity over our actual historical 
record since 1973.  In other words, productivity growth will have to 
accelerate simply to ensure that the future isn't <I>worse</I> than the 
SSA's already unsustainable official projection.  It would have to 
accelerate still more to ensure that things turn out better.  <P> Well, if 
the productivity revolution--at least as it is now unfolding--won't save 
us, maybe the new baby "boomlet" will.  It's true that current fertility 
rates, of about 2.0 to 2.1 lifetime births per woman, are a bright spot 
when compared with the low rates of 1.7 to 1.9 recorded during the "birth 
dearth" of the 1970s and 1980s.  But even if these higher fertility rates 
turn out to be lasting, they won't have much effect on federal tax revenues 
until the mid-2020s--long after fiscal meltdown is scheduled to occur.  
Even then the positive impact will be small.  To stabilize the ratio of 
retirees to workers, U.S.  fertility would have to surge to 3.0 or 
higher--in other words, back to the Baby Boom levels of the 1950s and early 
1960s, which no one expects.  For one thing, the share of American women 
who say that a family of four or more children is "ideal" has plummeted 
from nearly 50 percent to about 10 percent since the 1950s.  For another, 
the United States already has one of the highest fertility rates in the 
developed world.  Average fertility in other major industrial countries is 
now 1.6; in Germany and Italy it is 1.3.<P> Well, then, if not babies, what 
about immigrants?  Isn't importing more young workers a viable solution to 
America's aging?  Again, not really.  Immigrants, too, eventually grow 
old--and thus begin adding to Social Security and Medicare costs.  To make 
a substantial dent in the costs of America's aging, huge and destabilizing 
waves of immigration would be required.  In fact, to cancel out the 
projected growth in the Social Security payroll-tax rate over the next half 
century, today's level of net immigration would have to roughly quintuple, 
to about five million a year, beginning now.  The reality, of course, is 
that America is in no mood to reopen Ellis Island.  <P> Finally, consider 
health-care spending.  Some point to the recent slowdown in 
medical-<I>price</I> inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index) 
and conclude that our problem is behind us.  Not so.  First, what matters 
is total <I>expenditures</I> on health care, and thus far in the 1990s real 
federal health-benefit outlays have not slowed at all.  Second (and once 
again), the bleak official projections <I>already</I> assume a dramatic 
turnaround in recent trends.  Over the past quarter century real Medicare 
spending per beneficiary has increased at the rate of five percent a 
year--several times as fast as real per capita income growth.  Over no 
five-year period since 1970 has the growth in spending been less than three 
percent a year.  Yet the Health Care Financing Administration's official 
projection assumes that the growth in real per-beneficiary Medicare 
spending will slow to about one percent a year by 2020.  This projected 
cost-containment "triumph" is timed to occur just as aging Baby Boomers 
begin to increase the demand for every imaginable health-care service.<P> 
So let's hope--or pray--for productivity gains, higher fertility rates, and 
market-imposed discipline on health-care costs.  But let's not forget the 
rosy scenarios of the 1980s that never came true and the problems we never 
grew our way out of.  Public policy must be based on prudent expectations 
about the future--and prudence suggests that on our current trajectory the 
future may be worse than the bleak official forecasts.<P> No matter how 
clearly Social Security actuaries tell us that financial trouble looms 
ahead, politicians on both sides of the aisle are convinced that 
"middle-class" entitlement programs constitute the "third rail" of American 
politics: "Touch it and you're toast." So denial persists.  It would be 
pleasant to blame this denial on Washington and say that the rest of us 
know better--that all we have to do is elect more-principled public 
servants who will dare to confront these issues.  But the problem is 
interactive--the politicians and the people have all become gifted deniers.  
<P> Consider this irony: the public enthusiasm for budget balancing and 
cuts in "wasteful" programs is inversely proportional to the cost of those 
programs.  Ninety-four percent of those polled in one recent survey favored 
slashing foreign aid, 77 percent wanted to cut public-housing funds, and 75 
percent wanted to cut the space program.  Yet these programs together make 
up only about three percent of the federal budget.  Meanwhile, only 14 
percent of respondents wanted to cut Social Security, and only 22 percent 
favored cutting Medicare.  Yet these two programs together account for a 
staggering one third of the budget.<P> Or consider how we deny the truth 
about entitlement programs.  In justifying every new benefit increase and 
every refusal to accept slower growth in expenditures for the elderly, the 
senior lobby talks as if "old" meant "poor." But elderly Americans now have 
the highest level of per capita household wealth of any age group--and, 
counting in-kind income such as health benefits, a lower poverty rate than 
younger adults.  Although old-age benefits were originally intended to be a 
safety net for the truly needy, today's entitlement system more closely 
resembles a well-padded hammock for middle- and upper-class retirees.  One 
third of Medicare benefits, nearly two fifths of Social Security benefits, 
and more than two thirds of federal pension benefits now go to households 
with incomes above the U.S.  median.  Back in the early 1960s the typical 
seventy-year-old consumed about 30 percent less (in dollars) than the 
typical thirty-year-old; today the typical seventy-year-old consumes nearly 
20 percent more.<P> It is obvious that this senior affluence is not evenly 
distributed.  Millions of seniors would be destitute without federal 
benefits.  There is also no guarantee that this affluence will continue for 
future generations of elders, which is why Boomers must prepare for their 
own retirement now.  Households that are not saving enough must confront 
and act on their retirement-income needs.  In a recent study Public Agenda 
found that only 20 percent of U.S.  households are "planners" who 
deliberately save toward a quantitative goal.  The rest--"strugglers," 
"impulsives," and "deniers"--leave their future more or less to fate.<P> 
Younger Americans need to understand how great a change in saving behavior 
is required, but that this change will hardly be unbearable <I>if they 
start now</I>.  Thanks to compound interest, even small sacrifices count.  
A recent study published in <I>Fortune</I> magazine found that if a couple 
at age forty decide to go out to dinner and a movie only twice a month 
instead of four times, and put the savings into a 401K plan, they will net 
$169,500 for their retirement at sixty-five.  Paying off credit-card bills 
when they come in instead of incurring finance charges will yield another 
$121,400.<P> But if Boomers don't start providing personally for their 
retirement, then their golden years will hold nothing like the life of 
leisure that most of them seem to expect.  In <I>The Retirement Myth</I>, 
Craig Karpel warns that the generation we met in the 1980s as "yuppies" may 
reappear around 2020 as "dumpies"--destitute, unprepared mature people 
wandering the streets with signs reading WILL WORK FOR MEDICINE.<P><br> 
<CENTER><b>Coming <br> Transformations</b><P> </CENTER>Modern Americans are 
inverse Victorians.  The Victorians, of course, were famous for their 
prudishness about sex.  But they were loquacious in planning for their old 
age and eventual death.  A dignified death and a proud cemetery site 
represented important social values.  Their detailed wills were a boon to 
Britain's legal profession.  We are just the opposite: We will talk to 
almost anyone and say almost anything about our sexual experiences.  Yet we 
deal with aging and mortality as reluctantly as the Victorians dealt with 
sex.<P> Because we have difficulty talking about our collective aging, the 
social, cultural, and economic transformations that will be caused by it 
will come as a shock and a surprise to many of us.  "Shake the windows and 
rattle the walls" is what Bob Dylan wrote about Baby Boomers when they 
first came of age.  My purpose in this essay is to suggest how aging 
Boomers might shake the windows and rattle the walls of our society one 
more time.<P> <I><P> <b>The Retirement Transformation</b></I><P> As 
recently as 1950 most men who were physically capable of doing so continued 
to work past the age of sixty-five; fully a third of those aged seventy and 
up were still in the labor force.  Today just 16 percent of elderly men 
work.  This trend toward early retirement is no longer affordable.  
Moreover, given the growing number of Americans who reach the late sixties 
and seventies in good health and with valuable skills, it is no longer 
enlightened social policy.<P> As Robert Butler, a former director of the 
National Institute on Aging, puts it, America must develop a new vision of 
"productive aging" in which "work expectancy" increases along with "life 
expectancy." We seek satisfying love and sex after sixty--why not 
satisfying work as well?  The old idea of a rocking-chair retirement is 
dead, and it is time for the new idea of an active yet aimless and 
dependent retirement to die as well.<P> The open question is when and how 
this transformation will occur.  Should we change the Social Security 
retirement age to sixty-eight?  seventy?  seventy-two?  When will we tell 
those who will be affected, so that they can begin to adjust their life 
plans?  And how will employers keep so many seniors on the payroll?  What 
private-sector management and training programs will make senior employees 
more attractive?  How are we going to change the perverse Social Security 
incentives that discourage seniors from remaining in (or re-entering) the 
work force?  What jobs will best suit seniors who continue working, and how 
can we maximize their availability?  How do we revamp traditional career 
patterns to allow for semi-retirement, phased retirement, and 
"un-retirement"?<P> <I><P> <b>The Health Transformation</b></I><P> On the 
eve of the New Deal all levels of government spent roughly $1.00 annually 
on health care for the typical older American.  By 1965 the figure had 
risen to roughly $100, by 1975 to roughly $1,000, and by 1995 to roughly 
$7,000.  Thirty years ago America spent more on national defense than it 
did on health care.  Health care is expected to consume 18 percent of GDP 
by 2005--at least five times what we are likely to spend on defense.  And 
that's before the special multipliers of the age wave--especially the huge 
growth in the old old, who are most likely to require extensive acute and 
chronic care--even begin to kick in.<P> Americans prefer to believe that 
high and rising health-care costs are primarily the result of waste, fraud, 
and abuse.  If only we got rid of all the unnecessary tests and treatments, 
or slashed the excessive paperwork, or got tough on Medicaid cheats and 
profiteering drug companies, then presto, the problem would be solved.  But 
experts know that the real causes are far more intractable: fabulous (and 
fabulously expensive) new medical technologies, cost-blind benefit and 
insurance systems that exempt most Americans from having to make choices 
about treatment, and the American tendency to disdain limits, including the 
ultimate limit--death itself.  <P> Heirs of Ponce de Le&oacute;n, in search 
of the Fountain of Youth?  Perhaps that's too harsh.  But no other country 
switches on multimillion-dollar MRI scanners for routine complaints (we 
have eight times as many MRI units per capita as Canada), commits 
terminally ill patients to intensive-care units, or performs heart bypasses 
on septuagenarians at anywhere near the rates we do.  Americans, a European 
once observed, like to think everything is an option--even death.<P> The 
problem is that it is almost impossible to pinpoint aspects of our lavish 
style of medicine that are "wasteful" in the sense that they are of 
absolutely no medical benefit.  Little of what physicians do is based on 
certain knowledge of the outcome; most involves judgment calls about 
unknown probabilities.  Henry Aaron, the director of the economic-studies 
program for the Brookings Institution, speaks for most thoughtful observers 
when he writes that "sustained reductions in the growth of health-care 
spending can be achieved only if some beneficial care is denied to some 
people."<P> In the end the long gray wave will leave us no choice but to 
rethink what we mean by health.  Is it a consumer good that can be 
purchased on demand at the doctor's office, or is it a lifelong investment?  
Should that investment be a personal choice, or should it be regarded as a 
public duty?  How much should government be responsible for health care and 
how much should individuals?  Most important, what share of public 
resources do we wish to spend on health care for ourselves, and how much do 
we wish to dedicate to such economic and social goals as 
productivity-enhancing R&D and a better education for our children?<P> No 
other transformation presents such profound ethical questions.  Who will 
decide what costly heart transplants and similar death-defying high-tech 
operations are appropriate for the growing elderly population, especially 
the burgeoning old old group?  When, and how, will society determine that 
even if an eighty-five-year-old can enjoy another year of life through an 
expensive high-tech intervention, this may be the wrong value to 
pursue--especially when so many children lack even basic health-care 
coverage?  <P> <I><P> <b>The Youth Transformation</b></I><P> In an aging 
America everything will depend on the skills, education, productivity, and 
civic good will of younger generations--for their labor must support the 
elderly.  Yet nothing seems less obvious than their capacity to rise to the 
challenge we are passing on to them.  They will be relatively few in 
number.  They will inherit a huge national debt and a high and rising 
payroll-tax burden.  To make matters worse, many more of these future 
adults than today's adults are growing up in families, neighborhoods, and 
schools plagued by economic hardship and social dysfunction.<P> Since 1973 
the real median income of households headed by adults aged sixty-five and 
over has risen by more than 25 percent, while the real median income of 
households under age thirty-five has fallen more than 10 percent.  Counting 
all sources of income, poverty in America is three times as likely to 
afflict the very young as the very old.  The United States is the global 
leader in the life expectancy of eighty-five-year-olds but has fallen near 
the bottom of the industrial world's rankings in rates of infant mortality, 
marital breakup, child poverty, child suicide, hours of school-assigned 
homework, and functional illiteracy.  Meanwhile, per capita federal 
spending on the elderly towers eleven to one over federal spending on 
children.  The appropriate response to the outrageous is to be outraged, 
yet we seem oblivious of this devastating disproportion.<P> How can we 
remain an economic superpower when nearly a third of our children are born 
out of wedlock and few of their fathers are willing to assume legal, 
financial, and moral responsibility for them?  How will America prosper in 
a competitive technological and information-based global economy when its 
children grow up to exhibit school-dropout rates and rates of functional 
illiteracy that are among the highest in the industrial world?  How do we 
answer Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's haunting question: "Will we be the 
first species that forgets how to raise our young?" Or, to paraphrase 
Churchill, "Have we ever asked so much from so few, having done so little 
to prepare them for their burdens?"<P> We're talking not about physical 
capital but about human and social capital: the intact families, work 
habits, education, and high-tech skills upon which any hope of increasing 
productivity ultimately rests.  If we are going to rely on just 1.6 to 2.0 
workers to support every retiree, as the SSA forecasts suggest, we should 
want today's children to become the best educated, most skilled, and most 
productive citizens imaginable.  How does that square with our current rush 
to cut discretionary spending and defund social programs, from Head Start 
to vocational schools, that have long provided education and training?  How 
can we generate the funding and the political support to educate our young 
in today's overburdened economy?  How can we make the twenty-first century 
the century for our children?  <P> <I><P> </I><I><b>The Political 
Transformation</b></I><P> Today's seniors, represented by powerful lobbies 
and voting in disproportionate numbers compared with the young, are already 
a potent political force.  Will the rapid growth in the number of elderly 
enthrone the senior lobby as an invincible political titan?Or will the 
young, who must pay for tomorrow's senior benefits, find their political 
voice while there's still time to do something about it?  Averting a 
destructive conflict between the generations will require a political 
transformation.  But how can the young be encouraged to participate more 
aggressively in the political process?  How do we merge the public 
interests of young and old and show how dangerous it is for them to become 
adversaries?  <P> <I><P> <b>The Global Transformation</b><P> </I>I recently 
asked the head of Japan's Central Bank why Japan has resisted America's 
requests to cut its budget surplus and stimulate consumer demand.  His 
immediate response was "Because Japan must save so that it can afford its 
coming retirement wave"--a warning that the abundant and relatively 
inexpensive supply of foreign capital we have depended on for many years 
may soon disappear.  The banker's reply underscores the high priority that 
some other industrial nations assign to the economics of aging populations.  
<P> Americans have paid little attention, but since 1980 roughly a third of 
net U.S.  domestic investment has been funded by foreign creditors.  
Although some have expressed concern over how these capital inflows must 
give rise to a permanent annual debt-service charge on our national income, 
virtually no one has pointed out a more alarming prospect: not that the 
inflows will continue but that they could slow substantially as aging 
populations in other industrial countries consume more of their national 
income and savings at home.  If America cannot boost its domestic savings 
rate within the next decade, we may enter an era of rising real interest 
rates, capital rationing, and a forcible curtailment of domestic 
investment.  <P> There is also the issue of our relation to the 
less-developed world.  When half the population in the United States is 
over forty, half the population in some emerging markets of Latin America 
and Asia may still be under twenty-five.  Will the current distinction 
between rich and poor nations gradually come to be seen as a difference 
between old and young nations?  Will the former be characterized by 
creative consumption, short time horizons, and the defense of the global 
status quo, while the latter, mainly in Asia and Latin America, become 
known for energetic investment, long time horizons, and revolutionary 
changes in the global balance of power?  Will the newly democratizing 
economies of the former Soviet bloc be deprived of the foreign investment 
they need?  Or, alternatively, will a high-saving Third World be exporting 
capital to a low-saving First World--an ironic turnabout of the policy 
recommendations of the 1970s?  How will these demographic and economic 
shifts affect global institutions such as the United Nations, the OECD, and 
the World Trade Organization?  Will they effectively address the myriad 
issues associated with the global age wave and enormous unfunded retirement 
liabilities?<P><br> <CENTER><b>Turning America From <br> Consumption and 
Deficits to <br> Saving and Investment: <br> What Needs to be Done</b><P> 
</CENTER>to argue in favor of thrift is sometimes enough to earn one the 
label "declinist"--a person who believes that America's best days may be 
over.  This is not my view.  Still, I want to explain why, if we do not 
face up to the economic and social challenges ahead, America will age 
prematurely and perhaps enter a precipitous decline.  I do not believe it 
is un-American to suggest that we live in a finite world, that some desires 
can't be satisfied, and that bad choices can lead to tragic outcomes.  On 
the other hand, some good choices--eminently feasible, gradual, and humane 
choices--can provide a sound future for all of us.  <P> In an era crowded 
with social "crises"--from race to class --it may seem presumptuous to say 
that here we have a "real" problem that deserves our full attention.  But 
let there be no doubt: the economic implications of America's aging 
population over the next several decades will dwarf, in sheer dollars, any 
other big issue one might name.  Indeed, how we deal with the entitlement 
and savings crisis may determine how the other issues we face will 
ultimately play out.<P> If my analysis so far is correct, we are heading 
for a major crisis for which our society is unprepared.  But our political 
leaders cannot be expected to take this challenge seriously unless we as 
individuals do so as well.  A program of thrift thus has to work on all 
fronts, from the halls of Congress to our homes.  Here are some workable 
steps.<P> <B>1.<I> Achieve and guarantee long-term budget balance by the 
year 2002</B></I>.<I> </I>A campaign to boost saving must start with the 
federal budget, which can no longer be a borrower but must be a saver.  Of 
all the policy choices directly available to American voters, none would do 
a more reliable--and faster--job of raising the national savings rate than 
eliminating our chronic deficits.  I believe that we should achieve budget 
balance no later than 2002--a date, happily, around which a bipartisan 
consensus has finally emerged, after considerable Republican pressure.  The 
reforms we make, moreover, should, at least provisionally, guarantee 
long-term budget balance <I>after</I> 2002--not just temporary balance 
<I>in</I> 2002.  <P> The federal deficit is now 2.4 percent of GDP.  Over 
the past thirty years the United States--along with every other major 
industrial nation--has repeatedly achieved this degree of public-sector 
deficit reduction in fewer than seven years.  Moreover, since the federal 
deficit is projected to grow rapidly <I>after </I>the year 2002, a longer 
timetable would only make the long-term effort more difficult.  Balancing 
the budget, starting now, is like running to catch a train that's leaving 
the station.  To catch it in two minutes we would have to run harder than 
we would to catch it in one minute.<P> Some experts worry that this is not 
the right time in the business cycle to initiate a balanced-budget plan.  
But according to these critics, it may never be the right time.  So long as 
reforms are phased in gradually over seven years, there is little danger 
that a shift from consumption to saving will seriously depress the economy.  
Indeed, a credible budget plan might boost the economy if--as many 
economists, including Alan Greenspan, think likely--the markets react by 
lowering interest rates, particularly long-term rates, by two percent.<P> 
But mere budget balance is too timid a goal.  Given the shortage of our 
national savings, I believe that Congress should aim for a federal budget 
<I>surplus </I>of perhaps one or two percent of GDP through the first two 
decades of the next century, to make up for our recent profligacy and, more 
important, to lay up stores during the Boomers' peak earning years for the 
sudden burden that will accompany their retirement.  Or, better, Congress 
could aim for a smaller surplus but substantially increase spending on 
targeted public investments in education, worker training, and research and 
development--the kind of human-infrastructure investment that is essential 
to an information-age economy, but in which we are now sorely deficient.  
Either way, we would radically change federal budgeting.  We would no 
longer presume on the good will of our children but would demonstrate our 
good will toward them by moderating excess consumption, which makes us net 
takers, in favor of investment, which unites us as net givers.<P> <B>2.  
<I>Reform entitlement programs</B></I>.  Trying to achieve long-term budget 
balance without reforming entitlements is like trying to clean out the 
garage without removing the Winnebago.  The following reforms, taken 
together, would put these programs in long-term sustainable balance well 
into the twenty-first century.  <P><ul> <li> <I>Subject all federal 
benefits to an "affluence test."</I> The first sensible step toward 
long-term budget balance is to scale back entitlement subsidies flowing to 
people who don't need them.  To this end I recommend that we enact a 
comprehensive <A 
HREF="http://cpuserver.dc.enews.com/cgi-bin/mfs/01/tnr/archive/01/010896.4.html?11#mfs">"affluence 
test"</A> that would progressively reduce entitlement benefits to all 
households with incomes over $40,000--or more than $5,000 <I>above </I>the 
U.S.  median household income for 1996.  Households with lower incomes 
would retain all government benefits.  The affluence test would be applied 
<I>annually</I>--protecting the elderly in the event of an unexpected loss 
of income.  Higher-income households would lose 10 percent of all benefits 
that raised their income above $40,000, and 10 percent for each additional 
$10,000 in income.  Thus a household with $50,000 in total income and 
$10,000 in federal benefits would lose $1,000, or 10 percent of its 
benefits; a household with $100,000 in income and the same $10,000 in 
benefits would lose $6,000, or 60 percent; a household with more than 
$120,000 in income would lose $8,500, or 85 percent--the maximum 
benefit-withholding rate.  (This 15 percent exemption would ensure that 
even today's most affluent beneficiaries continue to enjoy a respectable 
tax-free return on their personal FICAcontributions.) All income brackets 
would be indexed for inflation.<P> Because the test would leave in place 
all benefits to lower-income households, the original "floor-of-protection" 
intention of nearly all federal benefits programs would continue to apply.  
Because such a large share of entitlements now goes to middle- and 
upper-income Americans (nearly 40 percent of Social Security payments go to 
recipients with incomes above<I> </I>the U.S.  median), savings would be 
large and would compound as the population aged and the number of 
beneficiaries grew.  Indeed, it is estimated that by 2040 <I>annual 
</I>savings would amount to more than $550 billion.  Finally, because the 
test would also be comprehensive, covering not just Social Security and 
Medicare but everything from farm aid to federal pensions to veterans' 
benefits, this plan would not pit one special-interest constituency against 
another.  <P> Since this affluence test was first proposed, in my book 
<I>Facing Up</I>, it has attracted considerable interest from both 
Democrats and Republicans.  It has also elicited criticism from those who 
for various reasons don't want entitlements reformed.  Some have said that 
an affluence test would constitute a tax on savings, and thus would 
discourage thrift.  There is no evidence to support this hypothesis.  More 
important, it ignores the larger issue--which is how to increase national 
savings.  Any decline in private saving caused by an affluence test would 
be dwarfed by the decline in benefit outlays--which in turn would translate 
dollar for dollar into smaller deficits and greater net national 
savings.<P> It has also been said that an affluence test would undermine 
public support for Social Security and other universal social-insurance 
programs.  The theory seems to be that we must bribe the affluent in order 
to ensure political support for benefits for the needy.  This is dead 
wrong.  Of all major proposals to reform entitlements, affluence testing 
receives the greatest public support.  According to a recent opinion poll 
by the Concord Coalition--a group that I helped to form in 1992, along with 
the former senators Warren Rudman and Paul Tsongas--67 percent of those 
asked would support reductions in Social Security benefits to higher-income 
households, and 77 percent would support reductions in Medicare benefits.  
Even majorities of older and of affluent households support such a 
reform.<P> <li> <I>Raise the eligibility age for full benefits</I>.  
Congress has already raised the Social Security full-benefit retirement age 
from sixty-five to sixty-seven, to be phased in from 2000 to 2027.  This is 
a step in the right direction (although most Americans are not aware of 
it), but the step is too small and too gradual.  My recommendation is that 
the Social Security retirement age be raised by three months a year until a 
new eligibility age of seventy is reached in 2015--a phase-in that would 
leave Boomers plenty of time to plan ahead.  In my view, early retirement 
should still be allowed at age sixty-two, but the benefits extended to 
early retirees should be reduced commensurately.  When this reform had been 
entirely phased in, workers would still enjoy more years of full benefits 
than were envisioned when Social Security was founded.  As Social 
Security's full-benefit eligibility age went up to seventy, so should 
Medicare's.  Americans aged sixty-five to sixty-nine could still 
participate in the program, but only by paying extra premiums.<P> 
<li><I>Set limits on federal health-benefit spending</I>.  We must 
restructure health-care benefits to control federal health-care costs.  
Currently we offer fee-for-service reimbursement to all eligible comers, 
with few cost disincentives, and then surround the process with a thicket 
of regulatory controls.  I propose that Medicare, Medicaid, and other 
health-benefit programs offer three choices: take a fixed-dollar voucher 
and use it toward the purchase of the health insurance of your choice; 
enroll in an accredited managed-care program that will then bill the 
government a fixed annual amount; or remain in the current fee-for-service 
system and face much greater co-payments and deductibles.  <P> Any reform 
that seeks to introduce market discipline into our system of federal health 
benefits must give beneficiaries real incentives to be cost-conscious.  
Hence the greater co-payments and deductibles for those who choose the 
expensive fee-for-service option.  The Medicare plan that Congress passed 
last year was all carrot and no stick.  It gave beneficiaries the choice of 
enrolling in new kinds of managed-care plans, but would have imposed no 
penalty on those who opted to stay in traditional fee-for-service plans.<P> 
These measures would shift the task of cost control away from regulators 
and back to patients and providers, where it belongs.  They would also 
allow Congress to live within a health-benefits budget, like the government 
of every other industrial country.  As for the senior lobby's attachment to 
a "free choice of doctor" guarantee, voters must be reminded that a 
declining proportion of today's young workers--whose FICA taxes pay for 
much of Medicare--enjoy the full freedom of choice that was once common in 
American medicine.  Most young workers consider themselves lucky if their 
employer pays for any health insurance at all.  <P> Another prime candidate 
for reform is the unlimited tax deduction for company-paid health-care 
insurance (which now amounts to a $92 billion annual subsidy from the 
federal government).  This wasteful and regressive deduction should be 
capped.  Federal efforts to establish national health-practice guidelines 
for doctors, hospitals, and insurers should be encouraged.  Although these 
standards would not be mandatory (patients or providers would still be free 
to spend their own money for services above the guidelines), they would 
give everyone a clearer idea of the cost-effectiveness of various treatment 
options--something all experts agree we lack.  <P> Finally, we need to 
reduce the huge costs of "defensive medicine," through malpractice reform, 
and of "heroic" intervention when recovery is highly unlikely.  Medicare 
spends approximately 30 percent of its budget on patients in their last 
year of life--often when the attempt to prolong life merely prolongs a 
hospitalized death.  Few Americans want to end their lives this way.  A 
recent survey shows that 89 percent of Americans support the concept of 
living wills.  Yet only nine percent actually have them.  Until we launch a 
widespread educational effort, make enforceable living wills widely 
available at very low cost, and perhaps even provide financial incentives 
to maintain them, doctors will continue to perform costly and painful 
procedures on patients who do not (or would not) want them and who will die 
in a few days or weeks anyway.<P> We should have no illusions about the 
future.  Whatever reforms we implement, federal health-care costs are going 
to grow faster than our economy.  This is one more reason why we must do 
everything possible to reduce growth in Social Security and other 
non-health-related programs.<P></ul> <B>3.  <I>Extend working 
lives</B></I>.  One of the best ways to reduce the crushing burden ahead is 
to encourage seniors to work longer--and make it easier for them to do so.  
This would require more than raising the age of eligibility for full 
benefits under Social Security and Medicare.  To encourage longer working 
lives we should abolish the Social Security "earnings test" for 
beneficiaries who continue to work.  (Let me stress that this reform 
<I>must</I> be implemented along with the affluence test I have described; 
a stand-alone aberration such as what Congress has recently proposed would 
be an unearned windfall for senior-citizen CEOs like me.) Yes, there would 
be a small direct budget cost.  But the benefits to the economy and to 
society, and to seniors themselves, of encouraging later retirement would 
be far more significant than the small increase in outlays.<P> The 
maturity, wisdom, and experience of older adults should not be lost to the 
workplace.  This is a matter not just of combating age discrimination but 
of unlocking a powerful human resource.  The market for jobs for which the 
elderly might be especially well suited should be explored: for example, 
full- and part-time service jobs in health care, child care, and various 
education and training efforts.  It is time to do elders the honor of 
making their phase of life one of ongoing contribution--of genuine 
"generativity," to use Erik Erikson's classic description--as long as they 
are willing and able.<P> Not everyone, of course, is able to go on working.  
Richard Trumka, the president of the United Mine Workers, who recently 
served with me on the Kerrey-Danforth Commission on Entitlement and Tax 
Reform, warns that later retirement is simply not a realistic option for 
worn-out industrial laborers in physically demanding occupations.  But such 
workers make up a small and shrinking share of the total labor force.  
Under my plan they would still have the option of early retirement (though 
with reduced benefits) and would be protected by federal Disability 
Insurance and Workers Compensation, not to mention the system of mandatory 
personal retirement accounts that I propose below.  I would also use a 
small part of the savings achieved by raising the Social Security 
retirement age to lower eligibility ages and raise benefit levels under 
Supplemental Security Income, the means-tested floor of protection for the 
low-income elderly.  In sum, we should encourage the elderly to work but 
not force work on those who are truly incapacitated.  In any case, our 
national retirement policy should not be determined by the miner retiring 
at age sixty-two any more than by the police officer retiring at fifty-two 
or the athlete at forty-two.  <P> <B>4.  <I>Establish a system of mandatory 
pensions or personal retirement accounts</B></I>.  I have 
concluded--reluctantly--that a fully funded, privately managed, and 
portable system of personal retirement accounts should be mandatory.  The 
system I envision would initially supplement Social Security--and over time 
might increasingly substitute for it.  But Social Security would continue 
to provide a floor of protection to all Americans, albeit one subject to 
the limits of the affluence test described above.  Governments around the 
world have tried to achieve both these objectives--retirement savings and 
poverty protection--in a single system.  They have achieved neither 
efficiently.<P> Why mandatory?  In 1993 C.  Fred Bergsten, the chairman of 
the Competitiveness Policy Council (a publicly financed, bipartisan group), 
asked me to chair a committee on capital formation.  An impressive group of 
the nation's leading economists joined me in this effort.  I had expected 
to hear that certain tax favors for saving (IRAs, for example) would 
significantly increase net savings--that is, savings beyond the cost of the 
tax incentive that encourages them.  I quickly learned otherwise.  The net 
effect of many of these conventional incentives has been marginal, because 
much of the money deposited in IRAs is simply shifted out of other 
investments.  When I asked how we might increase net savings significantly, 
one important area of agreement emerged: mandatory pensions or savings 
accounts covering the entire work force.  In addition to boosting private 
saving, such plans --by making tomorrow's retirees more 
self-sufficient--would allow us to reduce traditional Social Security 
gradually, thus reducing public dissaving as well.  I am perfectly well 
aware of the libertarian argument that decisions about saving should be 
left entirely to individuals.  The melancholy truth, however, is that many 
Americans are currently too myopic to save for the future unless compelled, 
and so end up becoming free-riders in the government safety net.<P> Why 
fully funded?  First, to boost national savings.  A funded retirement 
system would add to America's capital stock; a pay-as-you-go system does 
not.  Second, because the dynamics of pay-as-you-go financing have 
encouraged politicians around the world to promise benefits that can be 
paid for only by excessively high taxes on future generations.  The only 
way to avoid that temptation is to make it clear to everyone that above 
some minimum safety net a worker's future benefits will be determined 
solely by the resources that have been set aside for that worker, by some 
combination of employer contributions and the worker's own savings.  These 
pensions must be invested in diversified investment-grade assets and must 
be the worker's personal property.<P> Why privately managed?  A sound 
system of mandatory pension accounts must be publicly regulated to maintain 
fiduciary standards but should be privately managed to maximize returns.  
The evidence is overwhelming that publicly managed systems, which are often 
required to invest in low-return government securities, earn far less than 
privately managed accounts invested in the real economy.<P> Why portable?  
The new and fluid global economy, characterized by intense competition, 
rapid innovation, and relentless technological change, has made "lifetime 
employment" with one company rare.  Instead making several major job 
changes in one's lifetime--perhaps seven or eight for the average worker 
now in his or her twenties--is normal, and therefore many workers lack 
enough years of service in any one job to qualify for a pension.  The plan 
I propose would vest all contributions immediately, and so workers could 
take their pension savings with them as they moved from job to job.<P> To 
provide adequate retirement income, these accounts would require 
substantial contributions.  In my view, all workers (in some combination 
with employers) should be required to contribute four to six percent of 
their pay--which, added to FICA, would come to a total contribution of 
16&#173;18 percent of pay.  As a point of comparison, Australia's new 
system of mandatory pensions will ultimately result in total contributions 
of 15 percent of pay.  In the scheme I propose, workers would have the 
option of making additional voluntary tax-free contributions.  Employers 
who currently provide pensions could divert their contributions to workers' 
savings accounts as well.  The primary function of this system would be to 
finance retirement and survivors' benefits; in time it might also pay for 
long-term medical care.<P> Although mandatory pension contributions would 
be made in addition to current FICA payroll taxes, and thus would decrease 
the consumable portion of each paycheck, the system would be linked to the 
Social Security reforms described above--and this would prevent FICA taxes 
from rising to the alarming levels forecast for the next century.  
Eventually workers would be paying no more (and maybe substantially less) 
in combined FICA and savings contributions under my plan than they would be 
paying in FICA taxes alone in a status quo future.  By putting more of our 
income into genuine savings today, we could relieve the crushing 
payroll-tax rates that unfunded public transfers will otherwise exact on 
workers tomorrow.  <P> The reform I propose would also require that any 
current-year Social Security or Medicare cash surplus be transferred, on a 
pro rata basis, to workers' personal retirement accounts.  This provision 
would be consistent with pay-as-you-go accounting.  Meanwhile, workers 
would have a direct stake in reforms that constrain future growth in 
federal benefits.  To the extent that Social Security declines as a share 
of payroll, a growing share of FICA taxes would automatically be 
transferred to workers' savings accounts.  Let me repeat: My proposal is 
for a two-tiered system under which everyone would continue to receive 
Social Security benefits.  But over time my proposal would also allow us to 
go a step further.  As the savings in private retirement accounts built, 
the current universal Social Security system could be converted into a 
purer and much less costly floor of protection that paid out benefits only 
to the truly needy.<P> A mandatory savings plan would generate substantial 
net gains in household (and national) savings--and thus ultimately gains in 
productivity and living standards.  For middle- and upper-income workers 
subject to the affluence test this system would at least make up for 
reduced government retirement benefits--and probably go much further.  For 
lower-income workers, who are the least likely to save (either on their own 
or through pensions), it would vastly reduce the chances of a destitute 
retirement.  Seniors who were beneath the affluence-test threshold would 
receive their private pension on top of full federal benefits.  True, the 
deduction from wages would be a burden, but it's worth noting that because 
of the Earned Income Tax Credit, the existing FICA tax on many of the 
working poor is now entirely borne by the federal government.<P> Dismissed 
until recently as too "radical," "privatization" of Social Security has 
burst upon the scene over the past year.  Major proposals are under 
development at half a dozen think tanks--left, right, and center.  
Privatization has been featured on the cover of <I>Time</I> and embraced by 
the presidential candidate Steve Forbes, and, in one form or another, is 
endorsed by seven out of thirteen members of the Administration's official 
<A HREF="http://www.ssa.gov/policy/advisory_council_030895.html">Social 
Security Advisory Council.</A><P> My plan has elements in common with many 
of these proposals.  Where it differs from most is that it would fully pay 
for the transition to a funded Social Security system--and would do so 
<I>without adding to the national debt and without new general-purpose 
taxes</I>.<P> The challenge is that a single generation must somehow pay 
for two retirements--its own and that of its parents.  Some proposals 
simply ignore the challenge.  Take Steve Forbes's plan to keep all benefits 
for current retirees intact and yet permit younger workers to shift a 
substantial share of their FICA contributions into personal retirement 
accounts.  What his plan would add to private savings it would cancel out 
dollar for dollar by increasing the federal deficit.  Other proposals would 
issue Treasury debt directly to Social Security beneficiaries in the amount 
of the system's accumulated liabilities.  This, too, is a zero-sum game 
that will leave tomorrow's workers no better off than if we had never 
reformed the system.  A few proposals, like that of the Social Security 
Advisory Council, are more honest.  But to pay for the transition they 
would resort to large general-purpose tax increases.<P> My plan would pay 
for transition costs the old-fashioned way: not with smoke and mirrors but 
by taking the essential step of asking current beneficiaries and current 
workers to give something up--the former by forgoing some benefits, the 
latter by saving more.  This would not be painless.  The magic of 
compounded returns from the stock market and other long-term investments 
cannot solve all our problems.  To save more, we must consume less, at 
least temporarily.  This "transition cost" is the price of escaping the 
generational chain letter we have so far depended on.  <P> <B>5.  <I>Shift 
our tax base from income to consumption</B></I>.  In an aging society 
taxpayers should be penalized for what they take out of the economy 
(consume) as opposed to what they put in (save).  I therefore propose that 
only "consumed income"--spending, that is--be taxed.  It is true that by 
exempting savings from taxation this reform would narrow the tax base.  On 
the other hand, it would also widen the base, by rendering taxable various 
forms of government-financed and -subsidized consumption--from Social 
Security benefits and the insurance value of Medicare to employer-paid 
health care--which today are partly or fully tax exempt.  Tax rates thus 
need not be any higher than they are today.<P> Many will object that 
consumption taxes are regressive; but the consumed-income tax plan 
introduced by Senators Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici--in which the more one 
spends, the higher one's tax rate--demonstrates that consumption taxes need 
not sacrifice the principle of progressivity, which I support.  Moreover, 
without increased saving we cannot expect the real income of the typical 
American household to grow again--and without such growth the distribution 
of incomes will continue to widen.  The zero-sum politics of economic 
stagnation will overwhelm whatever weak contribution to economic equality 
we might continue to derive from our current system of progressive 
income-tax rates.<P> We are currently bombarded with tax-reform proposals 
of every variety--from sales taxes to flat taxes.  Some want to get rid of 
the Internal Revenue Service.  Some want tax returns that can be filled out 
on a postcard.  Who doesn't want simplicity?  And who likes the IRS?  But I 
would suggest a more important criterion for evaluating tax reforms: Which 
is most likely to increase net national savings?<P> <B>6.  <I>Mount a 
broad-scale public-education effort to promote saving</B></I>.  National 
leaders must help to mobilize citizens by articulating a sense of moral 
imperative.  A thrift plan needs a bully pulpit.<P> Can the right kind of 
education and exhortation make a difference?  Consider Japan.  Until the 
1950s, when the country rallied behind a campaign to promote thrift, the 
Japanese were poor savers.  Since then they've become famous for their 
saving.  Or consider Singapore, whose Central Provident Fund has furnished 
much of the investment capital that has fueled Singapore's legendary 
economic growth--not to mention the savings that have enabled nine out of 
ten households to become homeowners.  Or consider Chile and Australia, 
which have also established national pension systems based on the 
principles of full funding and portability.  In each instance public 
education was crucial to securing public support.  In Chile, for instance, 
Jos&eacute; Pi&ntilde;era, then the Minister of Labor, went on national 
television, often weekly, to explain why the mandatory pension plan was 
such good news for Chileans.  <P> <img src="./Cover3.gif" align=left 
hspace=10 vspace=10 alt=""> In a society like our own, where grassroots 
consensus is so important to governance, public discussion and debate are 
all the more important.  The problem is that for at least three decades 
leaders have been telling us that consumption, not savings, is the key to 
prosperity.  The campaign in favor of consumption has worked--all too well.  
Now it's time for a different kind of campaign--one in which not only our 
political leaders but also our businesses, our universities, and our 
public-policy institutions must persuade Americans to adapt to the 
realities of our aging society.  <P> What we need most of all is a moral 
vision, a Middle-Class Bill of Responsibilities--not a gaggle of leaders 
falling over one another in their rush to propose a Middle-Class Bill of 
Rights, or the middle class silently rehearsing the mantra "We are not part 
of the problem and we need not be part of the solution." Instead we must be 
encouraged to ask, What do we expect individuals and families to do for 
themselves, and what do we expect federal, state, or local governments to 
do for them?  What are our responsibilities to our own children and 
grandchildren?  How can we strengthen families so as to provide support for 
older people?  What are our obligations as a nation to our collective 
progeny?<P> The manual for Germany's social-security system looks, at first 
glance, a lot like our own--page after page describing the benefits due if 
one retires, is widowed, or loses one's job.  The most obvious difference 
is the generous benefits to German children.  But there is a more striking 
contrast.  For each benefit, alongside a box describing "Your Rights" is a 
box describing "Your Duties." Citizens are thus reminded that society must 
always balance the payer against the payee, the future against the present.  
We need to find that balance again in our culture.  <P> Why can't the 
President call for a White House Conference on Aging different from the one 
held last year--not one that panders to the senior lobby but one that 
encourages serious dialogue between old and young?  Why can't the President 
call for a global summit at which the leading economies focus on reducing 
their tremendous and unsustainable unfunded liabilities, and at which 
developing economies with younger populations concentrate on avoiding the 
mistakes the industrial countries have made in providing old-age security?  
<P> Companies also have a major educational responsibility.  With their 
human-resources and accounting departments, they are able to educate 
workers on the basics of saving--why they should save more, the power of 
compound interest, how to invest.  They can also make it easier for their 
employees to save--through automatic salary deductions, 401K plans, 
stock-purchase and dividend-reinvestment plans.<P> Bringing our youth into 
the savings crusade is another key.  John F.  Kennedy once challenged us to 
ask not what our country can do for us but what we can do for our country.  
Today's youth see the most conspicuous interest groups in our political 
system busily asking what the country can do for them.  But who represents 
the future and the general interest?  The young, alas, are the new silent 
majority.  The demographer Samuel Preston once remarked apropos of the 
relentless growth in senior entitlements that the political system would 
behave a lot differently if people were forced to live their lives 
backward--that is, if they had to look forward to the burdens imposed upon 
youth as their own future.<P> I suggest that young people embark on dual 
careers--a private career and one as a citizen.  As citizen lobbyists in 
behalf of the future, they are responsible for becoming informed about the 
debts they are going to assume, the unfunded liabilities they are going to 
pay for, and the unsustainable taxes they are going to bear.  Once they are 
informed, perhaps America's youth will initiate an honest dialogue with 
their parents and grandparents, without assuming that their elders are 
greedy old fogies who don't care.  My generation may be uninformed and even 
misinformed, but we do care about our children, our grandchildren, and our 
collective future.  But if anyone is to create a general-interest lobby in 
behalf of the future, youth must lead the way.<P> If we expect our leaders 
to lead, the voters must make it safe for them to do so. 
 <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/concord/cc_home.html">The Concord 
Coalition</A> is a bipartisan grassroots "lobby for the future," dedicated 
to breathing new life into the American Dream.  The warm reception we have 
received from countless concerned citizens has rekindled my faith that we 
can still build a special interest in behalf of the general 
interest.<P><br> <CENTER><b>Conclusion</b><P> </CENTER> And what of the 
special role for geezers like me?  Pessimists say, "Forget it"--Americans 
will not reform senior benefits until a severe crisis is actually upon us, 
but will persist in viewing them as contractual obligations that by 
definition are always affordable.  After all, an America that acknowledges 
limits is an America that has lost the one illusion that makes it unique 
and creative.  According to this view, America must always be an 
unteachable force of nature that can never back away from any promise or 
expectation, no matter how extravagant.  This, pessimists say, is why 
American voters repeatedly elect leaders who promise lower taxes, higher 
benefits, rejuvenated economic growth, and a magic bullet for every social 
problem--without caring how the pieces fit together.  <P> But I have a more 
optimistic view.  Two years ago I was interviewed by <I>60 Minutes 
</I>about the need to enact gradual but far-reaching structural reforms in 
federal entitlements for the elderly.  The show's producers, after 
patiently taping my arguments, invited me to join them at a middle-class 
retirement community.  Here, they said (with a few wry smiles), I could 
explain my suggestions to those who would be immediately affected.<P> 
Standing before this group of retired grandparents, I began by showing 
photographs of my own grandchildren.  I explained my concerns about their 
future and the world they would inherit.  I then reminded the retirees how 
much of our national affluence today rests on the willingness we had to 
make collective sacrifices during the Great Depression and the Second World 
War.  Back then we felt that we were "all in this together" for the sake of 
tomorrow.  I told them that the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer said 
it best for us when he observed, at the height of the Second World War, 
"The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world that it leaves 
to its children." <P> Sooner or later, I told the retirees, we will have to 
prepare for the future.  We will have to balance our public budgets, trim 
back benefits to those who need them least, save more as households, retire 
somewhat later from the work force, explore innovative means of economizing 
on health care, take a more effective public interest in the welfare of 
children, and offer the rising generation some tangible evidence that we 
are willing to make sacrifices in their behalf.  If we do so sooner, we 
still have time to plan for a gradual and humane transformation.  If we do 
so later, the changes are likely to be forced upon us, suddenly and 
painfully, in the midst of an economic, political, and family crisis that 
will leave the eventual outcome much in doubt.<P> Given all that, I asked 
them, if everything else were also put on the table and it really would 
lead to a balanced budget, how many of you would be willing to give up some 
share of your federal benefits, above what you need to live on, in order to 
ease the deficit burden on younger generations?  To the visible surprise of 
the <I>60 Minutes</I> producers nearly everyone raised a hand.<P> The 
generation I was speaking to survived the Depression and fought and won the 
Second World War.  After the war this generation provided its returned 
veterans with college educations, built the interstate highway system, 
eradicated polio, took us to the moon, and won the Cold War against 
communism.  Against these monumental accomplishments what it would take to 
solve our current crisis seems small.  I believe that this generation is 
capable of doing the right thing, and that politicians might well discover 
that it is better to appeal to their nobler instincts than to pander to 
their baser ones.<P> A people who have made a tradition of quick 
gratification must now be asked to focus on the requirements of a society 
graced with the patina of age--on saving rather than consumption, on 
prudence rather than desire, on collective restraint rather than individual 
satisfaction.  As Americans grow older, they will have to recognize that 
the live-for-today attitude that may be endearing or at least 
understandable in youth is not just unseemly but ruinously dysfunctional at 
the far end of life.  They would do well to heed the eighteenth-century 
French moralist Joseph Joubert, who warned, "The passions of the young are 
vices in the old." </blockquote>

<blockquote>



<i><font size=4>America has let its infrastructure crumble, its foreign markets decline, its

productivity dwindle, its savings evaporate, and its budget and borrowing

burgeon. And now the day of reckoning is at hand.</i></font><p>



<p><br><p><br>



<font size=5>I</font><font size=3>n 1981 Ronald Reagan took the helm of a nation whose economy was reeling, with

inflation in double digits, the prime rate hurtling past 20 percent, and the

national spirit sagging into bewilderment. Today other countries gaze enviously

over an American economic landscape that shows little track of past convulsions

and, indeed, seems to burst with new businesses, new jobs, new Dow Jones

records, and a newfound confidence.<p>



<p>



<p>



Yet, six years after the radical reforms of Reaganomics got under way,

Americans are about to wake up to reality: for some time now the foundations of

their economic future have been insidiously weakening. This awakening is

currently being delayed by the widespread preoccupation with "competitiveness."

Under the prodding of a trade balance in manufactured goods that collapsed from

a $17 billion surplus in 1980 to a $139 billion deficit in 1986, including the

first deficit ever in high-technology goods, and with additional shoves from a

shaky dollar, from nervous financial markets, and from stagnating real wages,

the so-called competitiveness problem is quickly climbing to the top of

America's political agenda.<p>



<p>



<p>



What does competitiveness mean? In many American households today it means

worry about future living standards and about whether one's children, ten to

fifteen years into their careers, will be able to out-earn their parents. In

corporate boardrooms competitiveness means the executive nightmare of seeing

Americans gorge themselves on goods from foreign firms.<p>



<p>



<p>



For many blue-collar workers competitiveness has an even crueler meaning:

layoffs and the understandable desire to get even with the anonymous forces

behind them. Over the past three years America's import deluge has resulted in

pink slips for one to two million domestic manufacturing workers each year .

More than a third of them remain indefinitely out of work; more than half the

rest have taken pay cuts of 30 to 50 percent in new jobs that cannot make use

of their experience. Economists are looking closely at this dislocation for

signs of structural disintegration in U.S. communities, and of the decay of

skills and habits that once made manufacturing an engine of U.S. comparative

advantage in world trade.<p>



<p>



<p>



In Washington competitiveness seems to mean both nothing and everything. Some

senators advocated a speed limit of sixty-five miles an hour on rural highways

as a "competitiveness" measure. House members are justifying yesteryear's jobs

bills by renaming them "competitive adjustment programs." And lobbyists are

arguing for stricter world cartels on everything from shoes to semiconductors

on the grounds that such agreements will improve our "competitiveness." After

announcing in its 1987 Economic Report of the President that recent U.S.

performance in manufacturing has vindicated our competitiveness, the White

House has refused to be upstaged on the issue, even going so far as to claim

that the Strategic Defense Initiative is "pro-competitive."<p>



<p>



<p>



Democrats are demanding that the Administration get back America's "rightful

share" of jobs and wages through protectionist measures. If imports are cut

back, they say, the jobs and income generated by producing for American

consumers will be miraculously transferred from foreign to U.S. firms. Get

tough on the other guys and our situation will improve--that seems to be the

general idea. What all public statements on "getting back" our competitiveness

neglect to mention is that Americans will have to give up something to get it

back. Over the next few years policymakers will wake up to the true cause of

our "competitiveness" predicament: the incalculable damage we have inflicted on

our economy in recent years.<p>



<p>



<p>



An x-ray of the damage would show its antecedents stretching far back in the

past, across several Administrations. Our national preference for consumption

over investment--the root malady--did not begin with the Reagan Administration.

Still, that set of policies loosely known as Reaganomics has certainly worsened

the damage. In the finest tradition of Euripidean irony, measures meant to save

us have worked in the end to afflict us, so much so that even our nation's

non-economic hopes--cultural, social, and strategic--have been clouded by our

disastrous fiscal mismanagement. It has been a hard lesson in the law of

unintended results.<p>



<p>



<p>



Intent: From a decade of feeble productivity growth (0.6 percent yearly in the

1970s) and early signs of rising poverty rates, we entered the 1980s flush with

expectations of "supply-side" prosperity. Result: We have ended up with still

feebler productivity growth (0.4 percent yearly from 1979-1986) and, despite a

debt-financed rise in personal income, with an upward leap in every measure of

overall poverty. More important, we have witnessed a widening split between the

elderly, among whom poverty is still declining, and children and young

families, among whom poverty rates have exploded--a development with dire

implications for our future productivity.<p>



<p>



<p>



Intent: After a decade of worry about our low level of net private domestic

investment (6.9 percent of GNP from 1970 to 1979) and an unsustainable real

decline in the construction of public infrastructure, we wanted the 1980s to be

a farsighted decade of thrift, healthy balance sheets, and accelerating capital

formation. Result: We have ended up with by far the weakest net investment

effort in our postwar history (averaging 4.7 percent of GNP from 1980 to 1986)

and have acquiesced in the crumbling of our infrastructure. Moreover, far from

renewing our saving habits or our balance sheets, or bolstering the "supply

side" of our economy, the 1980s have turned out to be the  most

consumption-based "demand-side" decade experienced by any major industrial

country during the postwar era.<p>



<p>



<p>



Intent: in 1980 American voters decisively endorsed a smaller and leaner

federal government, with special exceptions for defense spending and for

poverty-related "safety-net" benefits. Result: We ended up with a significantly

higher level of federal spending in 1986 (23.8 percent of GNP) than we had in

1979 (20.5 percent of GNP) --with most of the growth concentrated in precisely

what needed to be controlled: interest costs and entitlement benefits unrelated

to poverty (or, to put it bluntly, welfare for the middle class and up).

Federal interest payments on the national debt, $136 billion in 1986, are now

equivalent to the total taxpayer savings originally projected from the 1981

income-tax cut. As for federal benefits doled out regardless of financial need,

these have grown from about $200 billion in 1979 to $400 billion in 1986. They

totaled $46 billion in 1968.<p>



<p>



<p>



Intent: Entering the 1980s, we acknowledged that it was bad policy to allow

federal outlays to exceed federal revenues (with deficits averaging 1.7 percent

of GNP from 1970 to 1979). We promised ourselves to do better. Result: We made

the gap between spending and taxes wide beyond precedent (with deficits

averaging 4.1 percent of GNP from 1980 to 1986, and rising to 4.9 percent of

GNP, or 90 percent of all private-sector net savings, in 1986). Our publicly

held federal debt is nearly three times larger now than it was in 1980. The

projected deficit numbers have improved somewhat, but the much heralded future

declines are premised on very rosy assumptions--no recession, for example, and

an interest rate of 4.0 percent.<p>



<p>



<p>



Intent: Americans voted in 1980 for leadership that emphasized greater global

competitiveness and freer world markets as the most advantageous means of

achieving balanced economic growth. Result: America's steep decline in savings

during the 1980s has precisely reversed our intentions. We were promised a $65

billion trade surplus by 1984; instead we suffered a $123 billion trade

deficit. Today, despite four years of extraordinary luck on the energy front,

we have managed to twist the global economy into the most lopsided imbalance

between saving (foreign) and spending (American) ever witnessed in the

industrialize era. In the process--as we all know--we have transformed

ourselves from the world's largest creditor into the world's largest debtor. In

reaction to this shift the rest was inevitable: a more than tripling (from

about five percent to 18 percent) in the share of U.S. imports subject to

quotas, a colossal about-face in public opinion away from free trade, and the

appearance of the most blatantly protectionist bills before Congress since the

days of Senator Reed Smoot and Congressman Willis C. Hawley--despite the

President's free-trade convictions.<p>



<p>



<p>



Intent. America came into the 1980s longing to strengthen its military defenses

and to project its power abroad more effectively. Result. We now find that

budget deficits and an evaporation of the public's pro-defense consensus are

drawing an ever tighter circle around all our strategic options. Not only must

we now replay the wasteful 1970s by cutting short production runs on dozens of

weapons systems, but once again we are about to demonstrate to the rest of the

world that America is incapable of sustainable long-term defense planning.<p>



<p>



<p>



Intent: More than just a defense build-up, Americans wanted a more assertive,

unilateral foreign policy, a way to make ourselves stand tall again in our

leadership of the free world. Result: Our fast-growing debt to the other

industrial countries has diverted our diplomatic energy into placating foreign

central banks with exchange-rate agreements (already by May of this year the

interventions to support the dollar amounted to a staggering $70 billion) into

jawboning foreign governments to get their people to buy more of our exports,

and into pawning off our Third World financial leadership onto more solvent

economies. When action requires money, we now scrape our "discretionary" budget

to procure the most meager support. We spend virtually nothing to try to avert

the growing risk of social, economic, and political chaos right at our doorstep

in Mexico. An additional $50 million was nearly considered too much to send to

the Philippines after the 1986 democratic election of Cory Aquino. Even the

Administration now publicly declares that our "foreign-affairs funding crisis"

could mean "the end of U.S. global leadership. Eight years ago no one imagined

an austerity-led shift toward U.S. isolationism. Now we're seeing it: an

attempt to stand tall on bended knees.<p>



<p>



<p>



Intent: Going into the 1980s, America's deepest wish was that renewed economic

strength might foster a renewed cultural and ideological strength and an ethic

of saving, hard work, and productivity. We wanted to replace malaise with a

confident sense of forward motion. Result: As the ideological enthusiasm of

1981 has gradually been worn down by economic reality, this wish, too, has

foundered, leaving many of our political leaders as defensive and uncertain as

those of a decade ago--and almost relieved to have us fixated on public and

private scandals.<p>



<p>



<p>



While many in the Administration believe or act as if there is no problem--and

hence no need for a solution--others want to avoid all association with the

dreaded next act of the economy. The Democrats' fears show up in a darkly

humorous story told by Democratic leaders: On January 20, 1989, after the

inauguration, President Reagan flies off to Santa Barbara. While he is in the

air, the stock and bond markets crash, the dollar plunges, and interest rates

soar. When Reagan lands in Santa Barbara, he announces to a swarm of reporters,

"See, I told you the Democrats would screw up the economy!"<p>



<p>



<p>



For the time being, the competitiveness issue remains a sort of curtain that

Americans have hung between Reaganomics and the future. Neither political party

dares to disturb it, for it allows every policy leader to keep our attention

fixed on the trivial. For example, we are told to get furious about the trade

effects of Japanese "dumping" of semiconductors or enthusiastic about the

federal sale of loan assets as a way to plug the budget deficit, even though

every expert denies that such things make much difference one way or the

other.<p>



<p>



<p>



The truth is that the most astonishing success of Reaganomics has been the myth

of our own invincibility. This myth rests upon an enduring, bipartisan

principle of American political life which in the 1980s has become gospel:

never admit the possibility of unpleasantness--especially when it appears

inevitable.<p>



<p>



<p>



If you allow for unpleasantness, the mechanics of our trade deficit cease to be

confusing. America runs a deficit because it buys more than it produces. By

systematically discouraging measures that would boost its anemic net savings

rate, the United States has acquired a structural deficit economy, meaning that

at no stage of the business cycle can we generate the amount of savings

necessary for minimally adequate investment. In 1986, in fact, nearly two

thirds of our net investment in housing and in business plant and equipment

would not have occurred without dollars saved by foreigners. (This level of

investment was, to be sure, very low by historical standards, but without the

capital inflows that accompanied our trade deficit in 1986 it would have been

at the rock-bottom level of a severe recession year--lower, in fact, than

during the recession years of 1980, 1975, 1970, and 1958.)<p>



<p>



<p>



Washington debate over trade policy invariably neglects this elementary fact

about our balance of payments: dollars that flow abroad to buy imports always

flow back. (Since foreigners don't use dollars, they spend them as soon as they

get them.) The only question is how our dollars flow back--to buy our goods and

services or to buy our IOUs. During the 1980s we have decided that our biggest

"export" should be IOUs. In 1986 we sold to foreigners, net, a total of $143

billion in U.S. financial assets. Most of this consisted of stocks, bonds,

T-bills, repos, bank balances, and other assorted paper, but a steeply

increasing proportion of it was in real estate and other direct investment.

This financial surplus was the flip side of our trade deficit, and if we had

invested more at home, our surplus (in selling IOUs) and deficit (in selling

trade goods) would have been even greater. As long as we cannot function

without dollars saved abroad, exchange rates will fluctuate and interest rates

will go up until we can attract those dollars back as loans. America must learn

the basic distinction between capital flows for investment, which produce

future return, and capital flows for consumption-related debt (for example,

inflows to fund the budget deficit), which simply produce future debt

service.<p>



<p>



<p>



Correcting the current imbalance assumes that America can embark on an enormous

shift from consumption to savings, and that this shift will not throw the

world's economy into a tailspin, either by trade-led recessions in the other

industrialized countries or by a chain of debt defaults among the

less-developed countries (against whom we will be competing for trade

surpluses). The alternative to this daunting scenario, of course, is the crash:

a huge plunge in the dollar, unaffordable imports, a long recession, garrison

protectionism, rampant inflation, and a marked decline in American living

standards. The crash alternative prescribes that we pay off our debts through

indefinite poverty. Can we avoid the crash? Yes, but doing so will require

Americans to produce more while consuming less, and very close macroeconomic

coordination among nations.<p>



<p>



<p>



A European critic is reported to have said this about the link between

America's fiscal and international deficits: "Your policies in the 1980s remind

me of Christopher Columbus's travels. Like you, he didn't know where he was

going. He didn't know where he was when he got there. And he didn't know where

he'd been when he got back. All he knew for sure was that the whole trip had

been financed with foreign money." Or, as Fred Bergsten, the director of the

Institute for International Economics, recently quipped, "We finally understand

the true meaning of supply-side economics: foreigners supply most of the goods

and all of the money."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



How America has reached the end of an avenue with no pleasant exit is too long

a story to be told here. But it is worth mentioning the key contribution made

by two sweeping institutional developments that have taken place since the

beginning of the 1970s. Both are what might be called changes in the rules of

the game, rules that used to protect us from our own folly.<p>



<p>



<p>



The first change has been in how we legislate federal budgets. Until fifteen

years ago most federal spending was discretionary and unindexed, and federal

tax policy still functioned under the very strong presumption that federal

dollars spent should be paid for out of revenue. Large deficits, therefore,

were difficult to achieve, because so many easy corrective options were

available, both in spending and in taxing. The spending rule was eliminated in

the early 1970s by our decision to transform most non-poverty benefit programs

into untouchable and inflation-proof entitlements. The taxing rule was

eliminated in the early 1980s by the jihad prayers of supply-side economists.

Our deficit has thus become no one's responsibility. It is subject to

"projection" but no longer to control.<p>



<p>



<p>



The second big change has been the transformation of the world financial

system. Back in the early 1970s we all accepted the basic postulates of the

postwar Bretton Woods arrangements: fixed exchange rates and relatively little

mobility of capital between nations. But the problem with fixed exchange rates

was that they led to inconvenient balance-of-payment crises and didn't allow us

the freedom to determine our own macro-economic fate.<p>



<p>



<p>



So we closed the gold window in 1971 and shook ourselves loose from fixed

parities by 1973. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, as the dollar sloshed up

and down in ever larger waves, the world financial community accommodated our

proud creation the "float," and greatly liberalized the flow of capital across

borders. The inevitable result has been to give every nation--especially the

United States, as the owner of the world's reserve currency--much greater

latitude to borrow as it pleases, with few restrictions other than the specter

of national bankruptcy in the mind of the creditor. Fifteen years ago if the

United States had begun to borrow the equivalent of 3.5 percent of its GNP from

abroad, that would have created a national emergency, with Churchillian

presidential addresses and wartime austerity measures. Today it creates--well,

nothing, really. It's a number you can read about toward the end of the

business section of your newspaper.<p>



<p>



<p>



Most of these rule changes, with the exception of the new revenue-ignorant tax

policy, took place before Ronald Reagan assumed office. Countless commentators

have decided that Reaganomics represents a total reversal in inherited economic

policy. But not so many years from now historians may simply be calling it an

acceleration of inherited policy.<p>



<p>



<p>



For staying the course while double-digit inflation was tamed--the only Reagan,

or Reagan-Volcker, measure that seriously tested our threshold of

pain--President Reagan deserves credit, as he does for courageously taking on

the air-traffic controllers (which helped moderate the wage binge of the

1970s). He deserves credit as well for helping renew the popularity of markets

and of entrepreneurial risk, here and abroad, and for persuading us to abandon

the worst vices of regulation in such industries as airlines, banking, and

energy. And he was surely correct in advocating cuts in marginal tax rates. We

now know, for instance, that a maximum tax rate of 50 percent actually

generates more revenue from the wealthy than a maximum tax rate of 70 percent,

and provides real incentives for budding entrepreneurs. And for now, at least,

Reagan has swept off the agenda such policies as national planning,

wage-and-price controls, and wide-scale jobs programs.<p>



<p>



<p>



We need, though, to be honest: as far as the basic allocation of our economy's

resources is concerned, Reaganomics has either opted for or acquiesced in some

of the worst, future-averting choices America has ever made, the full

implications of which will not be known for years.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Vicious-Circle Economics<p>



<p>



To begin to grasp what Reaganomics has wrought, go back to the presidential

campaign of 1980. It was the evening of October 28, and the eyes of many

American voters were fixed on the television debate between Ronald Reagan and

Jimmy Carter. Facing the camera squarely Reagan posed his famous question: "Are

you better off than you were four years ago?" The next day newspaper polls

began to report a surge of support for Reagan, which led to a Reagan landslide

one week later.<p>



<p>



<p>



Now, imagine that Reagan had immediately followed up his question with this

guarantee: "I promise to make you feel better. While real personal consumption

per fully employed American hardly budged during the Carter presidency, I will

make it rise by about $300 per worker every year over the next six years. I'm

also going to kick in another $140 per worker per year that we in government

will be spending mainly to repair the fall in our defense budget during the

seventies.<p>



<p>



<p>



"How will I do it? Well, let me tell you. I will not do it by increasing the

quantity of real goods and services produced per working American to any

appreciable degree. Instead, I will do it by diverting to consumption, between

last year and 1986, about three quarters of the resources per worker now

devoted to savings. Half of the money will be obtained by simply cutting

domestic investment, and to do this we will run enormous federal deficits--so

big that the federal debt the public has bought since the time of the Founding

Fathers, about $645 billion at the end of 1979, will have nearly tripled by the

end of 1986. The other half will come from borrowing abroad. By 1986, in fact,

our foreign borrowing alone will fund all of our net housing investment and a

good 40 percent of our declining level of net business investment--freeing up

by that year a fantastic $2,100 of extra personal consumption per employed

American. From the end of last year to the end of 1986 our national per-worker

balance with foreigners will fall from a credit of $989 to a debt of $2,500;

and our federal per-worker balance with creditors, wherever they are, will

plunge from a debt of $6,750 to a debt of $16,562. I'll bet you're feeling

better already. Thank you and good night."<p>



<p>



<p>



This speech might not have won the presidency for Reagan. But it would have

forecast precisely the performance of the economy during the candidate's

subsequent term of office.<p>



<p>



<p>



Reagan was right in the debate with Carter: the 1970s were tough by comparison

with the 1960s. He was also right in observing that lower productivity growth

and higher federal-benefit growth during the 1970s "squeezed out" defense

spending in favor of privately earned spending on consumption. What looks quite

significant in retrospect, however, is that at least the squeezing did take

place. Few Americans watching the debate in 1980 ever imagined that over the

coming decade we would just decide to ignore the law that limits consumption to

production.<p>



<p>



<p>



This is, quite simply, the dirty little secret of Reaganomics: behind the

pleasurable observation that real U.S. consumption per worker has risen by

$3,100 over the current decade lies the unpleasant reality that only $950 of

this extra annual consumption has been paid for by growth in what each of us

produces; the other $2,150 has been funded by cuts in domestic investment and

by a widening river of foreign debt. From 1979 to 1986 the total annual

increase in workers' production amounted to about $100 billion (in 1986

dollars). The comparable total for increases in personal consumption plus

government purchases was about $300 billion. That leaves a difference of a bit

more than $200 billion--just slightly more than the increase in annual federal

deficits over the past six years. Deficit spending, of course, has been the

primary engine behind this consumption bacchanalia--a superhot and

super-Keynesian demand-side tilt that replaced the reviled "Tax and spend"

motto of the 1970s with the new motto "Borrow and spend." In every previous

decade we consumed slightly less than 90 percent of our increase in production;

since the beginning of the 1980s we have consumed 325 percent of it--the extra

235 percent being reflected in an unprecedented increase in per-worker debt

abroad and a decline in per-worker investment at home. This is how we have

managed to create a make-believe 1960s--a decade of "feeling good" and "having

it all"--without the bother of producing a real one.<p>



<p>



<p>



We cannot, of course, go on borrowing from foreigners indefinitely to finance

our consumption. Soon we must stop and, at that point, decide whether to repay

them the principal or to forever commit ourselves (and our children) to pay

annual interest to foreigners as the price for our 1980s binge. Nor can we go

on starving domestic investment to finance our consumption. Soon we must stop

and replenish the factories, bridges, and schools we have forgone or else

forever relegate ourselves (and our children) to slower growth in our standard

of living. Supply-side economics without the "supply" can have only one

sequel--something we may soon call vicious-circle economics.<p>



<p>



<p>



It is therefore all but inevitable that our level of consumption must slow its

climb, or even fall, while our level of production catches up. But of course

the speed with which it can catch up depends in turn on how much we can invest,

which depends on how much we can save.<p>



<p>



<p>



The connection between exploding public deficits and a lower national saving

rate is not absolute and unbreakable. Conceivably, we might have left overall

national savings untouched if we had engineered a huge rise in private-sector

savings at the same time that we embarked on a huge rise in deficit spending.

In fact, however, net private savings--the net income saved by private

households and firms--has been declining very sharply over the past decade

(from 8.1 percent of GNP in the 1970s to 6.1 percent of GNP in the 1980s).

Consequently, net national savings, which equals net private savings minus

public-sector dissaving, has been declining over the past decade, from 7.1

percent of GNP in the 1970s to 3.4 percent in the 1980s. In fact, during three

of the past six years--1982, 1983, and 1986--U.S. net national savings has

dipped below two percent of GNP. Huge capital inflows from abroad have thus

been inevitable.<p>



<p>



<p>



The conservative stewards of Reaganomics, ironically, have themselves created

the Keynesian nightmare--large and permanent deficits--they so much feared. And

Americans have endured it with remarkably little protest, because, after all,

if conservative Keynes-haters didn't know the dangers of deficits, who did?<p>



<p>



<p>



Apologists for Reaganomics once claimed that "rational expectations" would lead

people to increase private savings to compensate for public deficits and that

the tax cut of the early 1980s would lead to a savings surge. The latter line

of reasoning is legitimate and important--at the margin and over the long haul.

Unfortunately, it is an idea that works well only when we tax saving less and

consumption more. Most of the 1981 tax cut was simply an across-the-board cut

in personal income-tax rates and thus did little to alter the relative tax

burden on savings versus consumption. In any case, what is truly inexcusable is

the expectation that we could come out ahead simply by cutting the overall

level of taxation while still allowing federal spending to grow. When tax cuts

go unmatched by spending cuts, they must be accompanied by additional public

borrowing from households and firms--thus by a dollar-for-dollar reduction in

otherwise investable private savings. Therefore, in a near-full-employment

economy only a tiny fraction of the cut is likely to show up as additional

private savings. If families and firms treat the tax cut just as they treat

other income, the savings might be six or seven cents on the dollar--a tiny

margin that can disappear entirely if there is a negative shift in the private

sector's overall inclination to save. As we have already observed, there was

such a negative shift.<p>



<p>



<p>



Other apologists for the 1980s "boom" have claimed that there is no historical

correlation between public-sector deficits in bust years and negative trade

balances. Even after budget deficits had soaked up some private savings, they

point out, there was still enough left over for Americans to be net investors

abroad; that's why bust years typically brought us an improvement in our trade

balance. Evidence that this time-tested pattern no longer obtained, however,

was already surfacing in 1982, when the steepest recession in thirty years was

accompanied by such large-scale federal borrowing that our current account--the

ledger of our financial transactions with foreigners--did not break even. Since

then we have been sailing in uncharted waters: a cyclical recovery accompanied

by enormous and widening foreign-capital inflows.<p>



<p>



<p>



Some apologists for the 1980s have gotten so carried away with the idea of

market expectations--Reaganomics is all about psychology and expectations--that

they can justify any catastrophe by references to a rosy future. Alan Reynolds,

the supply-side guru, believes that heavy foreign borrowing is a sign of

economic strength. He has compared our huge current-account deficit today to

Japan's big trade deficits in the 1950s, claiming that what the two situations

clearly have in common is buoyant growth expectations. Although some U.S.

observers in the 1950s were dubious about the wisdom of Japan's foreign

imbalance, "in retrospect, U.S. worries about Japan's trade deficits look

rather foolish." Likewise for the United States today. "What has happened in

the 1980s," Reynolds writes, "looks like a reversal of roles, with the U.S.

becoming the relatively vigorous tax haven, attracting foreign capital and

goods, while Europe and Japan slip into the stagnant, export-dependent role

that the U.S. experienced in the Eisenhower years."<p>



<p>



<p>



The argument is half right. Japan was a capital importer in the 1950s, because

it was a rapidly growing economy--more than that, it was a country literally

reconstructing itself after a war that had largely wiped out its industrial

base. It borrowed abroad to finance a higher investment level than would have

been possible by relying on its already hefty savings rate alone. The result

was an incredible net investment rate of well over 20 percent of GNP. Did such

capital inflows make sense? Of course, for they rapidly paid for themselves in

increased economic output. From 1950 to 1960 the Japanese economy grew at an

average real rate of nearly 10 percent a year; real net output per worker grew

at the extraordinary rate of 6.6 percent a year. The relative burden of

financing the nation's foreign-capital inflows (which ceased by the mid-1960s)

thus fell over time.<p>



<p>



<p>



The parallel between the United States and Japan, however, utterly escapes me.

Over the course of the 1980s the U.S. investment rate has been the

second-lowest in the industrialized world (just above Britain); meanwhile, the

rate of growth in our real net output per worker, absolutely the lowest, has

averaged about 0.4 percent a year. That is less than one fifteenth of what the

Japanese were experiencing thirty years ago. Japanese productivity in the

1950s, in other words, grew more in nine months than ours now grows over ten

years. And unlike Japan, we have been borrowing abroad for consumption, not

investment.<p>



<p>



<p>



To find the proper historical parallel for the United States in the 1980s we

should not look to Japan in the 1950s, nor should we look to our previous

experience with heavy borrowing from foreigners. That was in the 1870s, when we

issued bonds (at half the current interest rate) to Europeans in order to

finance our huge investment in railroads and heavy industry. Instead, we must

look to those rare historical occasions when an economy's large size, its world

class currency, and its open capital markets have allowed it to borrow immense

sums primarily for the purpose of consumption and without regard to productive

return. The illustrations of lumbering, deficit-hobbled, low-growth economies

that come most easily to mind are Spain's in the late sixteenth century,

France's in the 1780s, and Britain's in the 1920s.<p>



<p>



<p>



So there we have it: a conservative Republican Administration that promised us

a high-savings, high-productivity, highly competitive economy, with trade

surpluses, and gave us instead a torrid consumption boom financed by foreign

borrowing, an overvalued currency, and cuts in private investment, with

debt-financed hikes in public spending and huge balance-of-payments deficits.

It's the same script, proceeding toward the same woeful finale, that we have

seen played out over the years by many a Latin American debtor. As one wit has

put it, just as the 1970s saw the "greening" of America, the 1980s is seeing

the "Argentining" of America.<p>



<p>



<p>



Now let us examine the pieces of this fiscal debacle in more detail. We will

turn first to the critical near- and medium-term challenge of reducing our

foreign-credit inflow--and, at the same time, of coping with the harsh policy

choices and the danger of global crisis that must accompany such a reduction.

Then we will take a longer-term view of the inexorable link between investment

and living standards. Finally, we will discuss the manner in which American

public policy treats our future. If before the 1980s this manner was one of

neglect, today it borders on open contempt.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



"Owing It to Ourselves" No Longer<p>



<p>



How much, exactly, do we now owe the rest of the world? Officially, our net

position (what we are owed minus what we owe) at the end of 1986 was a negative

$264 billion. By the end of 1987 we will be closing in on a negative $400

billion. The incredible speed of America's transformation from creditor to

debtor can hardly be exaggerated. Only six years ago, at the end of 1981, the

United States had achieved its all-time apogee as a net creditor, with an

official position of a positive $141 billion. Over the past six years, in other

words, the United States has burned up more than $500 billion, net, by

liquidating our foreign assets and by borrowing from abroad. That's an immense

flow of capital, even in global terms. By 1986 our net borrowing had dwarfed

the fabled bank recycling of OPEC surpluses after the oil price hikes of 1973

and 1979. The sum was twice the size of all foreign interest payments by all

the less-developed debtor nations, and about half the approximate dollar value

of total net investment in all less-developed countries combined.<p>



<p>



<p>



What does the future have in store for a nation that is borrowing such sums

from foreigners? As a net debtor of growing proportions, the United States must

inevitably become a sizable net exporter of goods and services. (I repeat:

exporter.) This proposition is just a matter of arithmetic. Since our

indebtedness cannot grow indefinitely as a share of our GNP--beyond some point,

foreign creditors will regard us as a growing credit risk, a risk that must be

compensated for by prohibitively high interest rates--our current-account

deficit must eventually decline substantially. And when that happens, we will

have to export more than we import in order to service our deficits on interest

and dividend payments to foreigners. Just to say that something is inevitable,

of course, does not tell you when it will happen. But I think it's fair to say

that the growth of America's foreign debt may push us--painfully--to a

current-account balance and a trade surplus by the mid-1990s, and almost

certainly will do so by the year 2000.<p>



<p>



<p>



Our opportunity for a relatively smooth readjustment is perilously narrow. On

the one hand, it seems likely that the rest of the world will grow reluctant to

keep lending to the United States once our net indebtedness rises much beyond

35 percent of our GNP, or a bit more than $1 trillion at today's prices. Some

experts suggest that this debt may entail net U.S. debt-service payments

equivalent, as a share of exports, to those of many developing nations and

about on a par with Germany's reparations burden following the First World War.

The experts agree that it is quite impossible for the United States to go on

indefinitely borrowing principal at or near its current rate of 3.4 percent of

GNP per year. Such borrowing, combined with accumulating debt-service costs,

would dictate an absurd $3 trillion in net debt by the end of the century and

foreign investors would close down the pipeline long before we got there.<p>



<p>



<p>



On the other hand, it is practically inevitable that our net debt will reach

the $1 trillion mark by the early 1990s no matter how vigorously we act to stem

the inflow of foreign savings. Obviously, there are limits to the speed with

which the United States can curtail consumption and generate growth in net

exports. Consider, for instance, a scenario in which the United States,

starting next year, makes steady additions to the value of its net exports such

that its current account reaches zero by 1994 and its net debt is reduced to

today's level by the year 2000. That sounds like a rather modest achievement.

Yet it will still lead to a net debt of about $1 trillion by 1994 and will

require a real improvement in U.S. net exports of more than $20 billion a year,

each year, for the next ten years, or a total positive shift of more than $200

billion. As Fred Bergsten has observed, the magnitude of the necessary

adjustment facing us is equivalent to about two thirds of our entire defense

budget and is several times larger than the total shift resulting in the United

States from the 1970s oil shocks.<p>



<p>



<p>



According to the adjustment scenario above, we need to reduce our foreign

borrowing stream by $20 billion yearly, or $200 yearly for each of our 100

million workers. Yet real net product per worker has been growing each year by

just $135. Further, our continuing debt growth will mean that about $40 per

worker per year must be devoted to rising foreign debt-service payments. And to

increase productivity sufficiently to raise net exports will require at least

our 1970s level of net investment at home--an additional $60 per worker per

year over a decade.<p>



<p>



<p>



So where are we going to find, each year, the extra $20 billion in unconsumed

exportable production necessary to make this readjustment scenario work? Over

the next decade, with only $35 per worker available ($135, minus $40, minus

$60), consumption per worker in the United States may have to decline by $165

each year. That's $1,650 overall for the average worker, and of course we can

expect those Americans with the most vulnerable incomes--minority workers,

young adults laboring under two-tier contracts, and service employees who

receive no benefits--to suffer losses that are far greater than average.

Neither the American public nor the nation's politicians have even begun to

face this prospect. In comparison, during the 1970s--a decade now known to most

of us as "hard times"--U.S. consumption per worker nonetheless rose by $200

each year. What the early 1980s gave us, the 1990s may well take away.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



In what exports, specifically, is the United States going to see the enormous

gains it must achieve to lower its trade deficit? First of all, we can forget

about any major contributions from the 22 percent of our trade exports now

composed of agricultural goods and raw materials. The $25 billion trade surplus

we had in agricultural exports in 1981 shrank to $3 billion last year. Over the

past decade the European Economic Community has raised its grain balance,

improbably enough, from a deficit of 25 million tons to a surplus of 16 million

tons. India, Pakistan, and China have all become net farm-product exporters.

Even the Soviet Union now seriously asserts the breathtaking goal of becoming a

net food exporter by the year 2000. We will therefore be lucky to slow the

current decline in our agricultural balance. Much the same goes for raw

materials.<p>



<p>



<p>



As for oil imports, nearly all experts expect that declining U.S. production

will push our current 25 to 30 percent dependence on oil imports to 50 to 60

percent during the 1990s, and at higher prices. Philip Verleger, Jr., a

visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics, estimates that

the value of our oil imports will rise from $4 billion in 1985 to $120 billion

or $130 billion by the mid-1990s. The 1980s have been happy, quiescent years

from an energy standpoint, but we may, in the 1990s, again face some of the

energy turbulence of the 1970s. The $70 billion real improvement (in 1986

dollars) in the energy balance that Americans have enjoyed since 1980, in other

words, will reverse direction. Let's be optimistic and assume that our annual

total farm and raw-materials balance for the foreseeable future will decline by

only $10 billion per year. That means we need a good $30 billion yearly

improvement in the remaining 75 percent of our exports--namely,

manufacturing.<p>



<p>



<p>



Some critics balk at this point and complain that this logic unfairly omits our

exports in services. According to a recent Fortune article titled "The Economy

of the 1990s," the United States will improve its balance on services by $125

billion between now and the year 2000. This service surplus, like some deus ex

machina, is supposed to more than pay the debt service on what Fortune admits

will be a "debt mountain" of some $1 trillion by the mid-1990s. This analysis

confuses a large flow of services that are actually debt service (for example,

the payment of interest and dividends) with a much smaller flow of services

that are actually current production (for example, travel, shipping, and

insurance). We already know what will happen to the balance on the former

type--it's going to go deep into the red. And U.S. exports of the latter type,

unfortunately, are both too small (a total of $49 billion in 1986) and too

inflexible to make much difference. Two thirds of these exports consist of

shipping, transportation, and travel; the rest consist of business services

that usually accompany trade exports. In fact, since so many of our high-tech

service exports are linked to manufacturing exports, it strikes me as virtually

meaningless to project one without the other.<p>



<p>



Let's be optimistic and assume that service exports will eventually grow by

fifty percent. That still leaves us with a need to increase our manufacturing

exports by $275 billion, or achieve a real annual growth rate of 10 percent

over the next decade. Can we emulate Japan and sustain such a prodigious

performance in manufacturing over so many years. Perhaps we can, but the

prospect seems daunting. So far in this decade our manufactured exports have

actually declined in real terms, but over the coming decade we will be aiming

for a higher export growth rate than we have yet achieved in the twentieth

century. In every respect the achievement would be unprecedented: we would have

not only to break our earlier record but to do it with a lower average level of

domestic business investment, with a complete freeze on imports, and with

steadily declining living standards.<p>



<p>



<p>



Any way one looks at it, the arithmetic is cruel and inescapable. It's hard to

imagine huge growth in our manufacturing output, for instance, without a very

large increase in domestic business investment. But to further increase

investment at home we may have to undergo a further decline in consumption, in

order to hold constant our net export improvement. And, clearly, we are not

going to see any decline in consumption in favor of saving unless there is a

radical change in our public policy, especially our fiscal policy (something I

will discuss later on), and in our politics as well.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



There remains, moreover, yet another problematic assumption in our readjustment

scenario: the willingness, or even the ability, of the rest of the world to

absorb our proposed huge increase in manufacturing exports. Current thinking on

this problem seems to grow out of two separate theories. One theory emphasizes

foreign economic growth, the other exchange rates.<p>



<p>



<p>



The foremost proponent of the first theory is the Reagan Administration, which

has repeatedly insisted that higher rates of growth abroad--particularly in the

stagnant-demand economies of West Germany and Japan--will solve our problem.

This is a worthy idea but hardly a solution. Consider, for instance, a

sustained one-percent real increase in economic growth in the rest of the

world--say, from about the current 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent (surely we cannot

expect more). Then imagine that all this growth is purely domestic. Using rosy

"multiplier" assumptions, we could get a two- or even four-percent real

increase in exports. Recall, however, that we need a 10 percent real

increase.<p>



<p>



<p>



The second theory, to which many economists subscribe, is that any level of net

export improvement is possible as long as we endure a "sufficient" decline in

the exchange rate--that is, a continued fall in the value of the dollar

relative to other currencies which will make our goods more attractive to

foreign buyers.<p>



<p>



<p>



Experience demonstrates, however, that exchange-rate adjustment also has its

difficulties. Over the past few years nearly all economists have been humbled

by how far they had overstated the extent to which world trade balances would

adjust to the recent fall in the dollar. Given this track record, it is cause

for deep reflection that forecasts now being made in major think tanks say that

even a 25 percent further devaluation of the dollar will be lucky to push the

annual U.S. current-account deficit much below $100 billion over the next few

years. The underlying problem might be posed as follows: even if we accept a

lower dollar, which I believe to be virtually inevitable, will economies in the

rest of the world accept it? The challenge facing America--generating a $275

billion positive swing in manufactured exports over the next decade--sounds

tough enough without worrying about whether our trading partners will

accommodate our necessities. Yet we often forget that our objective of huge

yearly increases in U.S. net exports translates directly into decreases in the

net exports of our major trading partners (recently the very source of much of

their growth). It's not just a question of our resolve; it's also a question of

their resolve, something over which we have little or no control.<p>



<p>



<p>



What we hope, of course, is that our trading partners will accept our agenda.

In general, we want them to raise the demand for goods and services in their

countries at the same pace at which we are suppressing demand, with smaller

fiscal deficits and higher private savings rates, in our own country.

Specifically, we hope they will stimulate their domestic demand with looser

fiscal policy, keep their currency strong with restrained monetary policy, and

pull down import barriers so that U.S. exports can expand with minimal pressure

on exchange rates. Our unspoken assumption is that once we decide to act, they

can be expected to cooperate.<p>



<p>



<p>



In reality, foreign economies may be otherwise inclined. Instead of loosening

fiscal policy, they may continue to tighten--raising their own national savings

rates in tandem with ours even at the risk of a collapse in global demand. And

instead of embracing a lower dollar, they may continue to resist it, either by

pushing their exports harder (with price cuts and aggressive marketing) or by

discouraging imports (with official or unofficial import barriers or simply a

social consensus not to "buy American"). Either way, readjustment may entail

risks that persuade all parties to abandon the effort. In the former case the

risk is worldwide economic stagnation. In the latter the risk is a precipitous

fall in the dollar and the danger of financial panic.<p>



<p>



<p>



Why might our trading partners not want to cooperate? For one thing, foreign

leaders may be slow to believe that the United States will do what it says it

intends to. Look at it from their point of view. Ever since 1983 the United

States has been assuring the rest of the world that it is just about to cut

back on its budget and current-account deficits and that other countries should

therefore immediately begin stimulating their domestic demand in order to "pick

up the slack." Other countries have responded with caution, and in

retrospect--the U.S. deficits having grown rather than shrunk--their leaders

must now be glad they were cautious. They still have their exports, they still

have their productivity growth, and they still have stable prices.<p>



<p>



<p>



Given the recent sharp fall in the dollar, many Americans figure that our

trading partners have begun to see the handwriting on the wall. Surely, we

think, Europe and Japan must soon opt for large-scale domestic stimulus in

their own interest--especially when it means the instant pleasure for their own

citizens of more disposable income and more consumption. Yet here we confront a

deeper issue--the vast differences in culture, history, and politics which make

it just as hard for other industrial countries to do what we find natural

(stimulate consumption) as it is for us to do what they find natural (stimulate

savings). We find inflation worth risking, but the West Germans, scarred by the

memory of the 1920s, would rather risk recession. We find it easy to sacrifice

exports on the altar of the high dollar, but the Japanese, who have spent

generations fighting to earn dollars to pay for their food, raw materials, and

oil, find the equivalent idea tantamount to economic surrender (particularly

considering their long-sought, stunning manufacturing trade surplus of $150

billion, or about eight percent of their GNP). The necessary reversals in

national economic direction are profound. If we assign Japan one third of the

needed adjustment, for example, or $50 billion annually by 1994, this would

amount to eight percent of its total manufacturing output (in a negative

direction). To those who argue that Japan adjusted successfully to two oil

shocks, and so can handle this challenge, I argue that those shocks required

the Japanese to do more of what they had always been doing (namely, exporting),

while the present predicament will require them to do less. American leaders

think that stimulating domestic demand is child's play. Most leaders abroad do

not. They are, in fact, extremely doubtful that their consumers will be able to

pick up where exports to America leave off.<p>



<p>



<p>



To allay doubts about our intentions, we must change our policy in credible and

irrevocable ways, and announce these changes ahead of time. Readjustment

becomes sticky when, even in the face of changing prices, foreign exporters

hope to preserve their sunk costs, their hard-won market shares, and their

relentless productivity and cost-reduction efforts--as Americans hooked on

imports hope to preserve their buying habits. Those hopes are our enemy. We

cannot cloud the air with chatter about painless global growth when in fact we

are asking exporters abroad and importers at home to endure inevitable

hardships.<p>



<p>



<p>



Second, to eliminate uncertainty about the implications of our policy, we must

talk realistically about a genuine transformation of the world's major

political economies. "Fair trade" (whatever that means) isn't really the point.

Our objective is to raise U.S. exports so that we avert a tragedy that

threatens everyone--a global crash. Finally, to encourage political as well as

economic balance in the world, we must renounce our recent policy of "global

Keynesianism"--the policy of being everyone's buyer of last resort. The

mercantilist aggressions bred by such a policy, including retaliatory

protection and games of "chicken" with exchange rates, have themselves become a

major obstacle to readjustment. Confidence, not fear, is the best way to get

foreigners to retool their export plants for their own domestic markets.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



If we simply proceed with the "business as usual" approach to the world's

growing imbalance, America's foreign creditors will ultimately become aware

that the situation is unsustainable. At that point anything, from a small

decrease in the value of the dollar to a mild political crisis, could cause

investors around the world to decide to rid themselves of dollar-denominated

assets. If the resulting plunge in the dollar's exchange rate persuades ever

larger numbers of investors to follow suit, the "dollar overhang" might at last

turn into the worst freefall nightmare of Paul Volcker, the former Federal

Reserve chairman: an avalanche pouring down on the dollar's financial capitals,

from London to San Francisco.<p>



<p>



<p>



The United States, in response, would have little choice but to raise interest

rates sky-high, in order to attract at least some investors to the dollar to

finance our budget deficits. We would also have to acquiesce in a long and

almost deliberate recession, both to shut down most of our foreign borrowing

(in a matter of months rather than years) and to suppress U.S. demand for

imports. Actually, the recession is likely to be of the "stagflation" variety,

since higher import prices may double our inflation rate even before we prime

the pump. The peak-to-trough downturn could be quite steep indeed and could

easily become our most severe economic crisis since the 1930s. Nor have I yet

mentioned how the razor-edge plight of many less-developed debtor nations will

add to the danger. Every forecast I have seen warns that the largest South

American debtors will be pushed from illiquidity to insolvency by a far milder

recession, and far smaller interest-rate hikes, than those envisioned here.

Many have even suggested that spreading defaults among less-developed countries

may precipitate the crisis.<p>



<p>



<p>



No one knows, of course, how long such a hard landing would last. It is

possible, I hope, that it would be limited to a financial crunch followed by a

severe but brief recession, rather than a lengthy depression. The economy could

recover with relatively moderate increases in world unemployment, but surely

the value of the dollar would be much lower and U.S. import levels would be

much reduced. This is what I call the "bumpy start-and-stop" scenario--the one

that has afflicted postwar Great Britain. Under this scenario the standard of

living in the United States would have dropped, its indebtedness would be

little changed (but no longer growing), its international responsibilities

would be necessarily curtailed, and its people would be aware, through

occasional jumps in interest rates and the yo-yo behavior of the dollar, that

their economic fate was hostage to the tenuous and nervous confidence of

outsiders. The British economist Michael Stewart recently observed that "anyone

who has lived through our 40 years of balance of payments crises, and seen the

constraints they have imposed on domestic policies, must stand amazed at the

insouciance with which the United States is piling up external debt." These

constraints, of course, were not only domestic; they also hobbled British

foreign policy--most dramatically in the Suez crisis of 1956, when the United

States, which held reserves of British sterling as foreigners hold our dollars

today, warned the British that we would declare war on the pound if they did

not stop their invasion of Egypt. So much for the perils of dependence on

foreign investors.<p>



<p>



<p>



Should we have the worst hard landing--a lengthy U.S. depression--let us simply

be forewarned that our traditional policy responses would be of limited use.

Hardship-bloated budget deficits would prevent us from applying more fiscal

stimulus; a low and skittish dollar would defy our attempts to loosen monetary

policy. Whereas the "start-and-stop" landing presumes that Americans could pay

for their debts by a one-time shock in living standards, and thereafter by

slower productivity growth and reduced international leadership, the

true-depression hard landing presumes that Americans would service and pay off

their debts through indefinite impoverishment. Either scenario could, of

course, lead to a resurgence in state control over the economy (on a scale that

might put Jimmy Carter's credit controls to shame)--an ironic last act in an

opera that opened with the chorus singing praises to laissez-faire.<p>



<p>



Some observers play down the possibility of such a crisis. They point to the

apparent ease with which the world has so far endured a substantial decline in

the dollar's value. Clearly, however, the easy stage is now coming to an end.

In trade, the dollar has now reached the point at which further declines can no

longer be absorbed by exporters' profit margins and will leave no foreign

alternative other than structural change or economic stagnation. Just as the

American economy has since 1980 suffered the trauma of de-industrialization, so

the Japanese economy has begun to suffer from what some Japanese call the

"hollowing out" of their industries--worker layoffs, unused capacity, and a

scramble toward offshore assembly. In finance, further dollar declines are

likely to be accompanied not by lower U.S. interest rates, as in the past, but

by unchanged or even higher interest rates, as we experienced last spring. This

will present the Fed with a no-win choice between defending the dollar and

loosening credit. And it will hit foreign investors with the double whammy of

further exchange-rate losses compounded by losses in bond-market values. The

preconditions for a dollar-dump panic, in short, may already be moving into

place.<p>



<p>



<p>



Of course, one hopes that Americans will never have to live through these

dismal outcomes. But avoiding them will take great effort--not just in changing

policy but ultimately in changing our very self-image and in persuading our

trading partners to change theirs. Japan's problem, a senior official there

told me recently, is global-asset management; ours, alas, is global-debt

management.<p>



<p>



<p>



The financial expert David Hale has written, "The U.S. is a debtor nation with

the habits of a creditor nation while Germany and Japan are creditor nations

with the habits of debtor nations." Needless to say, America must soon change

its habits, including its fixation on creative consumption. Our ability to do

so safely, however, will depend on more than just our own hard work and

determination. It will also depend on whether we can persuade our trading

partners to change their habits, at the same speed and at the same time that we

are changing ours.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Turning Away From Posterity<p>



<p>



Our growing foreign debt and trade deficit not only threaten a sacrifice in our

consumption levels but also symptomize our unwillingness to acknowledge a

deeper and more long-standing disease: a steady thinning out of those

activities and attitudes that tend to generate, over the long term, a rising

level of productive efficiency. When the seriousness of this problem became

increasingly apparent, during the 1970s, we should logically have chosen to

allocate fewer of our resources toward consumption and more toward investing in

productive physical and human capital. Instead, under a supply-side banner, we

have blindly chosen to do the opposite.<p>



<p>



<p>



Does it matter that our productivity is growing only a fraction as fast as it

was in the 1950s or 1960s? Indeed it does. To recognize some of the

consequences, we have only to consider that to end foreign borrowing with no

change in per-worker consumption or domestic investment will take us twelve

years of productivity growth at the current rate. The same task would take us

only a bit more than three years at the growth rate of the 1960s or only a bit

more than two years at the rate of the 1950s. To put it another way: Our

per-worker flow of foreign borrowing, as we have seen, is now running at about

$1,350 a year. But whereas the net product per worker that is left after we

service our debt, and that we can apply to reducing our current-account

deficit, is rising by only $95 a year now, it would be rising by $630 a year at

1960s growth rates and by $985 a year at 1950s growth rates.<p>



<p>



<p>



Yet it would be wrong to see productivity differences solely in terms of our

foreign balances. Far more important is the role such differences must play in

determining long-term growth in our future living standards. The cumulative

impact of small differences in yearly growth rates cannot be underestimated.

Consider the year 2020, when those who are now infants will be in the prime of

their working life. If productivity growth proceeds at its 1980s rate (and does

not decline still further), the average worker in 2020 will be producing

$40,100 worth of real goods and services, only about 14 percent more than his

or her parents are producing today ($35,300). Under the

smoothest-possible-readjustment scenario already described, which would result

in declining per-worker consumption through most of the rest of this century,

even by 2020 his or her yearly consumption will have risen only eight percent

above the 1986 level.<p>



<p>



<p>



America's standard of living, for the first time in its history, will have

hardly budged for a span of forty years. The 1980s and 1990s may be remembered,

with bitterness, as a turning point in America's fortunes--a period of

transition when we took the British route to second-class economic status.

Britain's decline took seventy-five years of productivity-growth rates that

were half a percentage point lower than those of its industrial competitors.

Because America's corresponding gap is more than three times as large, its

relative decline is proceeding far more swiftly.<p>



<p>



<p>



If, however, U.S. productivity now started growing again at the 7.4 percent

average rate that prevailed during the 1950s and 1960s, miraculous though that

would seem, our sons and daughters in 2020 would each be producing $77,200

worth of real goods and services--some 120 percent more than their parents are

each producing today. Consumption standards would rise by nearly as much, since

we would have been able both to close our foreign-borrowing gap and to recoup

our foreign liabilities by the early 1990s. In this case our grandchildren

would look back on us as relative paupers, and by 2020 Americans would be

enjoying buoyant prosperity and widening social opportunities in a nation that

would still be a leading force in the world's economic and political affairs.<p>



<p>



<p>



Understandably, most Americans do not want to confront the painful idea that we

are headed toward the wrong future. Yet that is the melancholy fact of the

matter. What is less understandable is the strident defense that so many

opinion leaders offer for our present course. We hear time and again that the

U.S. economy in the present decade has grown "as fast as" or "faster than" the

collective economy of the rest of the industrial world. So far as this claim

goes, it is correct. From 1979 through 1986 real U.S. GNP grew by a rate of 2.1

percent a year--about the same growth rate as that of the collective GNP of all

other industrial nations. However, in the United States most of the growth (70

percent) was due to increases in the number of workers, while in the other

countries most of the growth (85 percent) was due to increases in output per

worker.<p>



<p>



<p>



The rapid growth in U.S. employment has partly been the consequence of an

entrepreneurial and new-business surge, the flexibility of our labor markets,

and several booms (for example, a consumption boom, providing jobs in

distribution; the health-care-for-the-elderly boom; the home-services and

eating-out boom; and the postwar Baby Boom, which has no counterpart in other

countries). According to a recent Commerce Department report, from 1981 to 1986

the equivalent of nine million full-time jobs were created. And yet, contrary

to the widespread impression, this represents a job-creation slowdown; over the

previous six years the equivalent of 14 million full-time jobs were created.<p>



<p>



<p>



In any case, this kind of growth must cease within a few years, when all the

Baby Boomers are employed, and reverse itself in future decades, when young

adults will be scarce and retiring workers ever more plentiful. More important,

it is not the kind of growth that raises our standard of living. Augmenting

production by adding more working bodies (what classical economists used to

call the "dismal" Asian model) does not enhance the standard of living. Only

augmenting production per working person does that, and Europe and Japan do

that far more successfully than we do. The employment of the largest and

best-educated generation of Americans in history should have caused U.S. GNP to

rise far faster than GNP in any other country--as it should also have pushed up

our savings rate, since presumably this working generation of young adults will

want to allocate some of the extra production to provide for their children and

their own retirement (as the Baby Boom becomes the Senior Boom). Instead, with

the part-time nature and much lower value-added character of many of the new

jobs, we have barely managed to keep pace with the GNPs of our competitors, and

our savings rate has declined. This is not success but a large-scale admission

of failure.<p>



<p>



<p>



Yet it is surely true, the optimists say, that productivity growth and

investment performance in the other industrial countries have declined sharply

over the past fifteen years, and this must mean that we are doing better than

they are. Not really. Because the performance of the other countries was so

superior to begin with, and because our own performance has also fallen,

product per worker is still growing considerably faster abroad than here in the

United States.<p>



<p>



<p>



How have these economies managed? The most apparent factor has been much higher

investment levels. Here, Japan is the leader. From the 1960s to the 1980s its

total net investment as a share of GNP (including investment in public

infrastructure as well as in all private structures and equipment) has fallen

from 22.6 percent to 16.1 percent: the latter figure, however, is still three

times larger than the equivalent U.S. figure for the 1980s (5.3 percent). In

fact, at 1986 exchange rates (as the dollar falls, the comparison is getting

worse) Japanese net investment in 1986 amounted to $300 billion, while U.S.

investment amounted to only $270 billion. (This has been the result, in part,

of a cost of capital in Japan that has consistently been less than half ours--a

situation not at all helped by the 1986 Tax Reform Act.) It is a spectacle that

ought to shock Americans: a population half the size of our own, living on a

group of islands the size of California, is adding more each year to its stock

of factories, houses, bridges, and laboratories--in absolute terms--than we are

to ours. And Japan still has savings left over, about $80 billion in 1986, to

lend to thriftless foreigners. (About $50 billion of that sum was lent to us.)

Between the two countries, therefore, the 1986 disparity in net savings ($380

billion in Japan versus only $125 billion in the United States, a six-to-one

per capita difference) was even more lopsided.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



For years many U.S. experts have been predicting that the relative

productivity-growth advantage of the other industrial countries would soon slow

down. Back in the 1960s and early 1970s such predictions were based on the

"postwar reconstruction" thesis. Industrial phenomena like Japan and West

Germany, it was said, were growing faster merely because they still had to

"replace" the capital stock they had lost in the Second World War. More

recently this line of reasoning has been abandoned, because it obviously cannot

explain why these countries have replaced most of their business plant and

equipment several times over since the early 1950s. In Japan, to take the

extreme example, there is hardly a single factory now standing that has not

been built, rebuilt, or entirely re-equipped since the mid-1970s. Indeed, each

Japanese worker is supported by more than twice the plant and equipment that

supports his or her American counterpart. A new argument, therefore, has become

popular. This is the so-called convergence thesis, according to which other

countries are getting a free ride by copying American technological

breakthroughs. Once the other countries reach our level, it is said, their

productivity growth must slow down sharply. At that point they will have to do

the same tough "pioneer" work that we do.<p>



<p>



<p>



The convergence thesis makes sense only if we assume that the other countries'

overall disadvantage relative to the United States is spread about equally

across every economic sector and that it is especially marked in manufacturing,

where technology presumably is most important. Unfortunately this assumption

isn't plausible. Most economists agree that America's remaining absolute

advantage is due mostly to superior productivity in agriculture, raw materials,

and services, and that little if any of it is now due to superior productivity

in manufacturing.<p>



<p>



<p>



Instead of hoping for convergence, we Americans ought to recognize that we are

already getting beaten in manufacturing. We must also recognize that over the

foreseeable future the biggest productivity-growth opportunities in Europe and

Japan will lie in improving efficiency in agriculture and services--something

that requires no big research-and-development breakthroughs and could occur

with disquieting suddenness.<p>



<p>



<p>



The defenders of Reaganomics, of course, protest against any such conclusions.

The growth of U.S. manufacturing productivity, they claim, has been one of our

great achievements in the 1980s. And now that the dollar is back down where it

was when President Reagan took office, American exporters will no longer have

to compete against absurdly cheap foreign labor costs. The future, then, looks

bright.<p>



<p>



<p>



But does it really? True enough, U.S. manufacturing productivity has recently

run against our economy's declining trend. For example, from 1979 to 1985 Ford

reduced its global employment by nearly 30 percent while reducing its car and

truck output by only about five percent. Overall growth in manufacturing

productivity rose from a yearly average of 2.3 percent in the 1970s to nearly

3.2 percent in the 1980s. What the optimists do not point out, however, is that

such numbers are the perverse if pro-competitive result of seven catastrophic

years for U.S. manufacturers--two domestic recessions (1980 and 1982-1983)

followed by a high dollar export recession (1984-1986).<p>



<p>



<p>



Still less do the defenders of the 1980s want to point out that U.S.

manufacturing productivity, even with the help of its recent job-slashing

acceleration, grew more slowly during the 1980s than the average for our major

industrial competitors. And far from granting slower real pay raises, foreign

manufacturing exporters have been using their productivity advantage to grant

their workers much larger pay raises than firms in the United States have done.

Since 1969 real manufacturing pay has risen by only 17 percent in the United

States, but by a colossal 115 percent in Japan.<p>



<p>



<p>



The fact that U.S. wages have grown even more slowly than U.S. productivity

certainly reflects the adverse exchange-rate climb of the dollar during the

early 1980s. But since the gap in wage growth was already apparent at the end

of the 1970s--before the dollar's long climb--some experts suggest that it may

also reflect a negative shift in the image of U.S. goods for quality and

reliability. Our decline in underlying competitiveness, in other words, may be

even greater than what the output-per-worker numbers indicate. For this reason

the recent emphasis on quality by many U.S. manufacturers can only be regarded

as gratifying.<p>



<p>



A final defense of our economic performance in the 1980s rests on the sweeping

claim that none of this "smokestack" productivity matters anymore because our

economy will henceforth thrive on our alleged global monopoly on information

and inventions. Pure products of the mind have limited appeal as final consumer

products, however, and so one wonders how they can generate wealth unless we

have the capability--the plants, tools, and production skills--to turn them

into salable goods and services. Perhaps, it is said, we could sell this

intellectual property directly to foreigners. A good idea, but the numbers

hardy indicate that such sales could ever drive our economy by themselves. In

1986 our total net receipts from royalty and licensing contracts with

unaffiliated foreigners (including movie and TV rights) amounted to about $1.5

billion, or about four ten-thousandths of our GNP. And in inflation-adjusted

dollars our receipts of this kind have actually been declining over the past

decade.<p>



<p>



<p>



Knowledge and innovation, to be sure, are an absolutely vital precondition for

long-term economic growth. But we Americans tend to overrate the significance

of our leadership here. We forget that intellectual glitz and scientific glory

do not always translate into the humble, wealth-generating chores of commercial

innovation. Although we like to point out that we lead the world in the share

of GNP that we devote to research and development, we neglect to add that much

of this is devoted to obscure weapons R&amp;D that leads to few commercial

spinoffs. In civilian R&amp;D we lag behind both Japan and West Germany. We

should be pleased with the rapid growth of venture and equity financing for

small high-tech businesses during the 1980s, but we should also be cautious:

thus far we have seen no comparable surge in small-business R&amp;D, no

reversal in the downward trend in U.S. patent applications, and no resurgence

in high-tech exports. As for U.S. universities, they are indeed a global

showcase for Nobel laureates and pathbreaking research. Yet most of the

brilliance emanating from our universities is as freely available to foreigners

as it is to our own citizens.<p>



<p>



<p>



More important, it is hard to imagine any long-term economic

renaissance--especially one built on "working smarter"--without a determined

investment in the most precious of our assets: the skills, intellect, work

habits, health, and character of our children. Yet this is precisely where we

may be courting our most catastrophic failure. In the words of one analyst

cited by the 1983 National Commission on Excellence in Education, "For the

first time in the history of our country, the educational skills of one

generation will not surpass, will not equal, will not even approach, those of

their parents." Recent trends indicate that each year the typical American

child is increasingly likely to be born in poverty and to grow up in a broken

family. And a study by the Committee for Economic Development points out that

without major educational change, by the year 2000 we will have turned out

close to 20 million young people with no productive place in our society. The

CED study continues, "Solutions to the problems of the educationally

disadvantaged must include a fundamental restructuring of the school system.

But they must also reach beyond the traditional boundaries of schooling to

improve the environment of the child. An early and sustained intervention in

the lives of disadvantaged children both in school and out is our only hope for

breaking the cycle of disaffection and despair." Our children represent the

furthest living reach of posterity, the only compelling reason that we have to

be serious about investing in the future. And we are failing them.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The Politics of Debt<p>



<p>



There is no question that federal fiscal policy deserves much of the blame for

our national failure to invest during the 1980s; recall that the 1986 federal

deficit consumed the equivalent of 90 percent of all private-sector savings

that year. On the one hand, opinion polls consistently show that the American

public overwhelmingly favors, in theory, a balanced budget. On the other hand,

serious attempts to reduce the deficit continue to encounter, in practice,

enormous bipartisan resistance. Congress and the Administration invent

countless reasons why solving the problem can be postponed just a bit longer or

why the deficit can't really be doing us that much harm.<p>



<p>



<p>



We have little time left to get beyond such rationalizations. It is sometimes

asserted that our economy's saving behavior would be pretty much the same today

without a federal deficit. But, again, consider the numbers. During the 1980s

we have succeeded in nearly tripling the national debt, from $645 billion (at

the end of fiscal year 1979) to $1.745 trillion (at the end of fiscal year

1986). We have, in addition, saddled ourselves with an informal debt of nearly

$10 trillion in unfunded liabilities in Social Security, Medicare, and federal

pensions. That astronomical figure is the difference between the benefits

today's workers are now scheduled to receive and the future taxes today's

workers are slated to pay for them. It amounts to a hidden tax of $100,000 on

every American worker, and its toll will be exacted on our children.<p>



<p>



<p>



For Americans to believe that their national balance sheet is in the same shape

now as it used to be, they would have to believe that the enduring investments

made by the federal government during the past seven years are comparable to

all those made during the preceding two centuries--including the taming of the

frontier, victories in several wars, the Marshall Plan, miracle vaccines, the

Apollo missions, Grand Coulee Dam, and the interstate highway system.<p>



<p>



<p>



From fiscal year 1979 to 1986 federal revenue fell from 18.9 percent to 18.5

percent of GNP, while federal outlays rose from 20.5 percent to 23.8 percent of

GNP. Why has federal spending risen? The big growth areas over the past seven

years have been defense, entitlement benefits, and interest on our national

debt; all other spending has been cut back dramatically. Over the longer term,

however, entitlement benefits dominate the picture. Since 1965 they have grown

from 5.4 percent to 11.5 percent of GNP; all other spending excluding interest

(which simply represents the permanent cost of cumulative deficits) has

declined from 11.0 percent to 9.5 percent of GNP. This growth in entitlements

over the past twenty-one years is equivalent to 6.1 percent of GNP--an amount

greater than the entire investment we currently make in all business plant and

equipment, plus all civilian R&amp;D, plus all public infrastructure. Even

defense spending, as a share of GNP, has risen only half as much during the

1980s as it declined during the 1970s. At 6.6 percent of GNP in 1986, defense

spending is still lower than it was in any year from 1950 to 1973.<p>



<p>



<p>



Our budget-cutting efforts during the 1980s have failed because they have

allowed continued growth in the one type of spending--for entitlement

benefits--that had already risen to unprecedented heights. Even where the 1980s

budget ax has fallen hard, the major victims have been precisely those rare

federal programs whose purpose is physical or human investment rather than

consumption.<p>



<p>



<p>



This last point is worth emphasizing, for it explains the unique vulnerability

in recent years of that small area of the federal budget called discretionary

non-defense spending. That's the old-fashioned type of spending in which

(Congress--unconstrained by automatic-indexing formulas and prior-year

contracts--votes on bills each year, presumably for the best interest of our

national future. Unfortunately, since the future has no lobby, no formula, and

no contract, the Administration and Congress have found this the perfect place

to demonstrate their budget-cutting zeal publicly even while allowing all other

types of spending to keep rising. By 1986 discretionary non-defense spending

had been cut to 4.09 percent of GNP, its lowest level since 1961.<p>



<p>



<p>



This spending category includes that bellwether of federal investment activity

the maintenance and construction of America's public infrastructure. Net real

investment in roads, bridges, mass transit, and other public works has dropped

by 75 percent over the past two decades; much of our infrastructure is wearing

out far more rapidly than it is being replaced. We do not have a new generation

of infrastructure technology, from high-speed trains to underwater tunnels,

because we have chosen not to pay for it.<p>



<p>



<p>



But the steep decline in federal investment during the 1980s has not been

limited to infrastructure. Investment in our environment and in human

capital--research, education, job skills, and remedial social services--has

also plummeted. These, too, have now been deemed superfluous. From 1979 to

1986, in real dollars, federal spending on natural resources has been cut by 24

percent, non-defense R&amp;D by 25 percent, aid to schools by 14 percent, and

energy preparedness by 65 percent.<p>



<p>



<p>



Far from forcing a "revolution" in the role of the federal government, the

1980s have instead seen the federal budget become an ever larger and more

efficient consumption machine. In the mid-1960s checks mailed out automatically

(to bond owners, health insurers, retirees, state and local benefit

administrators) accounted for about 58 percent of all federal non-defense

spending. By 1979 their share stood at 68 percent; today it has grown to nearly

80 percent. We have now reached the point, in fact, where even if we eliminated

all discretionary non-defense spending (imagine that we could fire all

civil-service employees and replace them with a giant check-writing machine),

the federal budget would still be running a deficit. Our government's function

as an investor, a steward of our collective future, is small and shrinking. Its

function as a consumer, a switchboard for income transfers, is large arid

growing.<p>



<p>



<p>



Surely, it is argued in defense of the growth in entitlements, the alleviation

of poverty also constitutes "investment" of a sort--an investment in the

long-term social and economic benefits of preventing serious material hardship.

If the premise were valid--that federal entitlements go to the poor--this would

be a worthy argument. Unfortunately, the facts seem to be otherwise. In 1986

the U.S. public sector spent about $525 billion, or 12.5 percent of GNP, in

benefit payments to individuals. Of this total, about $455 billion was financed

at the federal level: about $360 billion consisted of cash payments, and the

rest consisted of in-kind payments (for example, health care, food stamps, and

rental assistance). How much of all this went toward alleviating poverty? No

one knows for certain, but probably no more than about 20 percent of the total,

or approximately $100 billion. The rest represents income transfers from

non-poor taxpayers to non-poor beneficiaries (and, increasingly, to non-poor

purchasers of federal debt).<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



This result should not be surprising, considering that of the $455 billion

dispensed from the federal budget, 85 percent was not means-tested--in other

words, was not targeted to people living in poverty. These non-means-tested

benefits went, by and large, to those groups least likely to be poor. The

lion's share, $271 billion, consisted of Social Security and Medicare payments,

which went indiscriminately to nearly every elderly person. The elderly now

enjoy the lowest poverty rate--less than three percent when the calculation

includes total benefit income--of any age group. Far from targeting the poor,

Social Security cash benefits are actually regressive, in the sense that those

with the highest lifetime incomes receive the highest monthly payments. Another

$47 billion was spent on the two most generous pension systems in America:

civil-service and military retirement programs. Among the beneficiaries of

these programs poverty is practically unheard of; most are not "retired" at all

but working at another job and earning a second pension. The average annual

income for a federal pensioner is now more than $35,000. Still another $26

billion went to agricultural subsidies. Though this is equivalent to about

$18,000 per person working in agriculture, it doesn't help many farm workers.

Instead it goes primarily to the owners of the farms with the largest sales,

and to banks to service farm debt. Finally, about $43 billion was spent on

assorted other non-means-tested programs, such as veterans' health care (going

mostly to elderly people with higher-than-average incomes and without

service-related illnesses). Unemployment compensation, amounting to less than

$18 billion, almost gets lost in this sea of money.<p>



<p>



<p>



Many of these programs, and especially Social Security, provide invaluable

income support to millions of people who would be in poverty without them. This

is true especially for members of what Stephen Crystal, in America's Old Age

crisis, calls the "multiple jeopardy" groups--those who can be characterized in

two or more of these ways: over seventy-five (a group expected to grow by more

than 50 percent by the year 2000), widowed, single, divorced, in poor health,

without a private pension, and nonwhite. For example, the mean income of the

black elderly was only 54 percent of the mean income of the white elderly in

1980. But these people are helped mainly by dint of the enormous sums of money

spent, not by virtue of any rational allocation scheme.<p>



<p>



<p>



It is also argued that federal retirement benefits "belong" to the

recipient--despite the consensus among experts that the benefits payback for

Social Security and Medicare is five to ten times greater than the actuarial

value of prior contributions; plainly put, even middle- and upper-income groups

get back vastly more than they put in (including interest and employers'

contributions). As for civil-service retirement, we are told that it is a

genuine pension system, under which federal workers and federal agencies each

contribute seven percent of payroll to a "trust fund" in behalf of every

worker's retirement or disability. Yet the pension level is so high (averaging

56 percent of pre-retirement pay), the retirement age so young (age fifty-five

after thirty years of service), and the disability criteria so easy (one

quarter of all civil-service pensioners are "disabled") that every outside

actuary has found, here too, that benefits far exceed contributions. Most say

that recipients get somewhere between two and three extra dollars for every

dollar they contribute. Unlike any private pension, moreover, civil-service

pensions are 100 percent indexed to the Consumer Price Index--with the absurd

result that federal pensioners often outearn their successors in office.<p>



<p>



<p>



As for military retirement, here we confront the ultimate bonanza. The

serviceman contributes nothing to a trust fund, but upon reaching a median age

of forty-one (and completing at least twenty years of service), he is entitled

to 50 to 75 percent of pre-retirement pay, indexed yearly, for life. Typically,

military pensioners--including many of the most valuable members of our Armed

Forces, who are induced to quit by the retirement bonanza--spend more years

collecting benefits than they ever spend in the service. Only one quarter are

over age sixty-five, all are eligible for Social Security, and most pursue

second careers to achieve a "triple-dip" private pension.<p>



<p>



<p>



The Administration and Congress have often boasted of "cutting back" on

excessive benefit spending. Unfortunately, nearly all the painful and

high-visibility cuts have been made in the 15 percent of all benefit programs

that are means-tested. One result is that means-tested benefits have hardly

grown at all as a share of GNP during the 1980s (in fact, excluding Medicaid,

they have actually shrunk; hardly any poverty cash benefits are indexed).

Another result is that such benefits target the poor even better now than they

did in the 1970s, since most of the cuts have effectively excluded many

near-poor beneficiaries, those whom we do not consider truly needy. Meanwhile,

the tremendous non-means-tested programs--protected by powerful middle-class

lobbies and automatic 100-percent-of-CPI indexing--have burgeoned.<p>



<p>



<p>



Over the past generation federal benefits have grown roughly twice as fast as

our economy. What is most ominous about the long-term trend in the cost of

non-means-tested benefits, however, is that these benefits will necessarily

continue to grow faster than our economy even if we do nothing explicit to

increase benefit levels. Just leaving the budget on "automatic pilot" will lead

to fiscal disaster. The forces guaranteeing this result are threefold: the

aging of America, the hyperinflation in health care, and the uncontrollability

of benefit indexing.<p>



<p>



<p>



The aging of America: Well over half (about 56 percent) of all federal benefits

now go to the 12 percent of our population who are age sixty-five and over. We

now direct, on average, about $9,500 a year in federal benefits to each elderly

American (largely consumption). In contrast, we direct less than $950 in

federal benefits, including aid to education, to each American child (largely

investment). In fact, total federal spending on net infrastructure investment

and non-defense R&amp;D, the benefits of which will last several generations,

amounted to only $357 per child in 1986. That's equivalent to the increase in

federal benefits per elderly person that now occurs every six months.<p>



<p>



<p>



But even if benefits per elderly person henceforth grow no faster than our

economy, we can be certain that the total cost burden will. By about the year

2015 the age composition of the entire United States will be the same as that

of Florida today. By 2040 there may be more Americans over age eighty than

there are Americans today over age sixty-five. Over the next fifty years,

depending on future fertility and longevity, our working-age population will

grow by two to 18 percent, while our elderly population will grow by 139 to 165

percent.<p>



<p>



The more "pessimistic" projection (to use the strange term applied by the

Social Security Administration to the projection involving longer life-spans)

implies that our labor force will grow by only six million people while our

elderly population will grow by 46 million. Today each retired Social Security

beneficiary is supported by the payroll taxes of 3.3 workers. By the year 2020

the ratio will have declined to at most 1:2.3. The official pessimistic picture

shows the cost of all FICA-funded Social Security benefits rising to an

obviously unacceptable 36 percent of every worker's taxable pay by 2040, from

13 percent today.<p>



<p>



<p>



Health-care hyperinflation: The novel cost-saving reforms introduced four years

ago to Medicare and Medicaid (such as the new prospective pricing now used by

Hospital Insurance) stirred widespread hope that we had turned the corner on

the rapid growth of health-care spending. Today such hope has faded. Although

total U.S. health-care spending as a share of GNP fell slightly in 1984 (from

10.5 percent to 10.3 percent), it rose anew, to an unprecedented 10.7 percent,

in 1985, and further, to 10.9 percent, last year. We already know that the rate

of inflation for medical care was 7.9 percent in 1986, a rate about seven times

higher than the rise in the Consumer Price Index. Optimistic projections made

by federal health officials just two years ago are already in shreds. As the

Health Care Financing Administration admitted in its report last year, "Little

relief appears to be in sight....The decline in the share of GNP going to

health in 1984 appears to be a one-time blip in the historic trend rather than

the start of a new trend." Healthcare benefits as a share of the federal

budget, meanwhile, did not experience even a one-year dip. They have risen

every year of the 1980s and now amount to about $120 billion annually, or 25

percent of all federal benefit spending.<p>



<p>



<p>



The underlying causes of America's health-care cost explosion have been

discussed at length elsewhere: the rapid climb in real technological and labor

costs per treatment, the impressive increase in the number of treatable acute

and chronic illnesses, and, of course, the stubborn persistence, in both the

public and private sectors, of inefficient health-care regulations and

perverse, cost-plus reimbursement systems that insulate both health-care

professionals and patients from the cost of treatment.<p>



<p>



<p>



Amazingly--even with the federal reforms enacted in this decade--Medicare has

shown nearly the same real rate of annual growth in the 1980s (8.7 percent from

1979 to 1986) as it did in the 1970s (8.7 percent from 1969 to 1979). As

recently as 1975 Medicare's total cost was only $14 billion. Last year it was

$74 billion, and it may well hit $100 billion by 1990. By 1991 outlays for

Hospital Insurance, which account for two thirds of Medicare benefits, may

already start to exceed payroll-tax revenue. Thus, without further reform the

Hospital Insurance trust fund will almost certainly go bankrupt by the end of

the 1990s.<p>



<p>



<p>



Why have the reforms thus far proved ineffective? A large part of the problem

is that per capita health-care costs are rising much faster for the elderly

than for the population as a whole. Longer life expectancy means

disproportionate growth in the oldest age groups, and it is well documented

that every measure of health-care utilization rises steeply from age sixty-five

on. In 1982, for instance, the average reimbursed hospital cost for Medicare

enrollees over age eighty-five was two thirds higher than that for enrollees

aged sixty-five to seventy-five. The average per capita cost of long-term care

is ten times higher for the "old" elderly than for the "young" elderly, and the

high cost of long-term nursing care for the elderly, which is not covered by

Medicare, is steadily encroaching on means-tested public benefits not primarily

designed for the elderly. In 1984, for instance, though the elderly made up

only 10 percent of Medicaid's beneficiaries, they accounted for nearly one

third of Medicaid's total spending.<p>



<p>



<p>



Experts at the Health Care Financing Administration now project that

health-care spending in the United States will hit 15 percent of GNP by the

year 2000. Do we really think we can become competitive in trade while

allocating a still larger proportion of our scarce supply of capital and

skilled labor to health-care consumption? According to Lee Iacocca, the

Chrysler Corporation pays more money to Blue Cross/Blue Shield every year than

it does to any other supplier. Sooner or later we must debate health-care

spending in terms of affordability. We must ask why, for instance, we continue

to devote so many resources to comforting us at the end of life (more than half

of an American's lifetime health-care costs are incurred after age sixty-five),

while we pay a Head Start teacher less than $10,000 annually to prepare us at

the beginning of life. Other industrial countries are facing such questions

with both common-sense humanity and a steady eye on the future. We alone are

not.<p>



<p>



<p>



Uncontrollable indexing: The history of the indexing of non-means-tested

benefits is one of the sorriest stories in federal policy-making. Perhaps the

most flagrant case in point was the egregious "double-indexing" of Social

Security cash benefits enacted in 1972, which essentially pushed up the

benefits for new retirees by two CPI indexes at once. This was a colossal error

that caused the average retiree benefit to grow far faster than either prices

or average wages during the mid-to-late 1970s. The error was apparent to nearly

every policy expert as soon as the legislation was passed. But though Congress

took only several weeks to debate and pass the 1972 Social Security amendments,

it required several years to correct the mistake. In the late 1960s only six

percent of all benefits were indexed; today 78 percent of all benefits are

indexed to one price index or another, including nearly every non-means-tested

cash benefit. The result, quite simply, has been to render outlays for benefits

uncontrollable by either Congress or the President.<p>



<p>



<p>



Most important, indexing makes it impossible for elected policy-makers to

reorder their spending priorities by gradually allowing real benefit levels in

some programs to fall behind inflation while committing new resources to new

problems. This perversity is highlighted by the names that we give to these two

types of spending ("discretionary" to outlays earmarked for national

investment, and "entitlements" to outlays earmarked for personal

consumption).<p>



<p>



<p>



Back in the early 1970s, when most federal benefit programs were first indexed,

none of these problems seemed to matter much. Back then, after all, real

federal spending, real GNP, and real wage levels were all still growing

rapidly. Today such problems obviously do matter. Facing the prospect of

declining or (at best) stagnant real consumption per worker over the next ten

or fifteen years as we do, it follows almost by definition that during many of

these years we will see prices rising faster than after-tax wages. Each year

this occurs, indexing will automatically cause benefit spending to grow faster

than wages are growing. The very nature of indexing will then pose genuine

questions of equity: to what extent should beneficiaries not in poverty be

"held harmless" from downward jolts in the standard of living that affect all

other Americans?<p>



<p>



<p>



To say that the fundamental forces driving up federally financed consumption

are aging, health-care inflation, and indexing is not, of course, to say that

there is any painless way to avoid them. They cannot be avoided, precisely

because all three forces are so closely connected to the shape of our

population, as well as our technology, expectations, and political culture. We

can, however, speculate on the consequences of trying to avoid them. Recently I

asked James Capra, an expert on the federal budget (an unequaled forecaster of

our current deficits), to make a forty-year projection of the federal

budget--given no change in defense or domestic policy and using the same

long-term economic and demographic assumptions that are used by the Social

Security Administration.<p>



<p>



<p>



The results? Using the official pessimistic assumptions, total non-means-tested

benefit spending--in the absence of any new benefit provisions--will rise by an

amazing 9.6 percent of GNP by 2025, as the retiring Baby Boom generation claims

its health-care and cash retirement benefits. By then the explosion in

Medicaid-funded nursing care will add another 1.2 percent of GNP. All told,

assuming that the totality of other federal costs grows no faster than our

economy, the total projected federal outlays for fiscal year 2025 will amount

to about 35.4 percent of GNP. Outlays for benefits will consume 22.3 percent of

GNP--a sum nearly equal to the entire federal budget today--and outlays for

Social Security and Medicare alone will consume more than 31 percent of

workers' taxable payroll. These incredible results are most certainly not

predictions; instead they are projections of the future of our present

policies. That these outcomes seem impossible is a virtual guarantee that they

will be just that. What they mean is that today's policies are unsustainable.

They will be radically changed. The only question is how--whether in a

political spasm or gradually allowing those affected to plan ways of coping.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



From Denial to Reconstruction<p>



<p>



We face a future of economic choices that are far less pleasant than any set of

choices we have confronted in living memory. What, concretely, will these

choices entail? Looking into the future is always a dangerous task, but here is

my attempt to sketch a sequence of future economic issues that will change our

lives. My sketch follows the probable chronological order--near-term,

medium-term, and long-term--in which reality will impose these issues on us.<p>



<p>



<p>



The near term (1988 to 1992). Over the near term (a period that already exceeds

the "long-term" time horizon of almost every legislator and executive

policy-maker) America's primary economic challenge will be to extricate itself

from growing foreign indebtedness without touching off a global crisis. The

single most important step toward a successful outcome will be for America to

generate steady, large, and predictable increases in its net national savings

rate over the next several years. This, in turn, cannot be accomplished without

steps to eliminate the federal-deficit drain on private savings. Fiscal balance

is thus the cornerstone of any plan to cut our trade deficit.<p>



<p>



<p>



So long as the U.S. demand for foreign savings remains insatiable, any attempt

to force-feed U.S. exports to foreigners in any one sector or to any one

country will simply be vitiated by a stronger dollar, which will tend to worsen

the U.S. trade balance in all other sectors or with all other countries. It's

like placing a few sandbags on top of an overflowing dam: you can change where

the water will spill over, but you can't change the fact that it will spill

over somewhere. If there is little action on the federal budget over the next

five years, therefore, the odds of a global crash landing will certainly

grow.<p>



<p>



<p>



As we have seen, a successful escape from our foreign-sector imbalance (barring

an improbable near-term leap in U.S. productivity growth) could be accompanied

by a decline in real consumption per U.S. worker. Over the next five years, in

other words, we must be prepared for a perceptible fall in real after-tax

employee compensation combined with a similar decline, or at best a stagnation,

in real government spending--both in benefit payments and in defense spending.

On the positive side, we can look forward to a rapid expansion in U.S.

manufacturing output and employment, a steady improvement in our trade balance,

and a steady decline in the rate of foreign-capital inflows (slowing, though

not stopping, the deterioration of the net U.S. investment position by 1992).

But, in order to avoid the crash scenarios, there is plenty that we must also

prepare for on the negative side: a further (though modest) decline in the

exchange rate of the dollar, considerable inflationary import-price pressure,

and a very tough assignment for the Federal Reserve Bank and its new chairman,

Alan Greenspan--finding an interest rate high enough to control inflation and

keep the dollar from collapsing, yet low enough to avoid a serious U.S.

recession. Most likely, the Fed will have to strike a balance between bad news

on both fronts: some accommodation to inflation (as import prices rise) and

some accommodation to higher interest rates (as foreign lenders get finicky).<p>



<p>



<p>



For most working Americans the coming decline in the growth of real household

consumption will probably be felt not in any marked change in dollar salary

raises but rather in the erosion of real dollar income caused by unavoidably

swifter inflation. Wages in manufacturing, exportable business services, and

energy will climb much more steeply than wages in other sectors--a trend

reversal from the early and middle 1980s which many Americans will welcome. The

indexing of federal benefits, meanwhile, will become a major political issue.

Not only will steady reductions in budget deficits be difficult to sustain

without a major reform of indexing, but 100 percent cost-of-living adjustments

for middle- and upper-class federal beneficiaries during years of declining

real income for most American workers will raise reform as a stark question of

equity. The cost-effectiveness of defense and foreign-aid spending will also

come under increasing scrutiny. Since we know full well that it will take a

heroic effort to find the resources for economic investment alone, it is

totally incredible that we could fund both our domestic obligations and our

current global military obligations. By the end of this decade, therefore, it

is likely that the United States will raise strategic "burden-sharing" as a

routine point of discussion in our economic summits with other industrialized

powers.<p>



<p>



<p>



The medium term (1992 to 2007): The fifteen years that follow our near-term

period promise to be a crossroads in our nation's future. As Americans enter

this era, five years from now, they may still be uncertain whether the United

States has successfully worked its way out of its foreign-sector imbalance.

Ironically it will probably be a signal of impending disaster if real

per-worker U.S. consumption is significantly higher in 1992 than it is today,

and it would almost certainly be a symptom of worsening global imbalance. Other

symptoms would include minimal reductions in our budget deficits and in our

credit inflows, further cuts in our net domestic investment, high interest

rates, and special ad hoc arrangements to keep our creditors happy--such as

yen-denominated Treasury bonds or de facto foreign veto power over U.S.

monetary policy. More likely, we will see a considerable dampening in real

per-worker consumption, and we will be worrying about (or trying to recover

from) a long recession characterized by stagnant global demand.<p>



<p>



<p>



But twenty years from now when young adults currently entering the work force

are approaching the peak of their careers and when the oldest Baby Boomers are

contemplating retirement, the foreign-imbalance problem will have been

resolved, one way or the other. By then we may have entered one of the

prolonged crash scenarios sketched earlier--the decline of the bumpy British

variety or the indefinite depression of the 1930s variety. If, on the other

hand, we have resolved the problem successfully, we can expect that our

current-account deficit will have declined steadily during the early 1990s and

will be turning into a modest surplus by the late 1990s. As that happens, the

focus of our policy debates will likely shift from the problem of reducing our

foreign borrowing to the challenge of raising our level of domestic investment.

Over the near term most of our extra savings must be focused on raising net

exports, which is our sole means of weaning ourselves away from foreign

creditors. Only later will we be able to concentrate on the more rewarding task

of reconstructing our future. Only after paying off our credit-card bills, so

to speak, can we think of buying a new home.<p>



<p>



The long term (2007 on): Should America not make investment its number-one

policy priority in the medium term, it will surely have to pay the price in the

long term. It will not be a price denominated solely in terms of labor

productivity, real wages, and global political influence. The price will also

include an utter lack of preparation for the most stunning demographic

transformation--from workers to dependents--in American history. In the fifteen

years between 2010 and 2025 the number of Americans who are of working age will

decline by perhaps as many as 12 million (from 174 million to 162 million).

Meanwhile, assuming that current longevity trends persist, the population of

elderly will grow from 42 million to 65 million. If investment, retirement, and

health care for the elderly seem unaffordable to our society today and for the

next twenty years, when a "boom" generation is working and a "bust" generation

is retiring, we can only imagine how unaffordable they will be thirty years

from now, when the situation is reversed.<p>



<p>



<p>



If in the medium term the Baby Boom has channeled a sufficient share of its

income into education, training, tools, and infrastructure to permit a quantum

leap in productivity by the next generation of workers, it may enjoy a

prosperous and contented old age. But if the flow of invested endowments from

each generation to the next has ceased--and if each generation instead insists

on its "right" to consume all its own product and part of the next generation's

as well--then we can count on a meager and strife-torn future.<p>



<p>



<p>



In any summary discussion of America's prospects in the near, the medium, and

the long term, there is one theme that must be emphasized above all others: the

indissoluble bond between the economic behavior of one decade or generation and

the economic well-being of the next decade or generation. Over the near term we

must accept the punishment we are inheriting from the ill-fated gamble of

Reaganomics. Similarly, over the medium term we must overcome the

low-investment heritage we have received from thirty years of postwar

preoccupation with "demand management." Both tasks will require a determined

effort to save. We will have to raise our net national savings rate, now

somewhere between two and three percent of GNP, to between six and seven

percent of GNP in the coming five years (a level still beneath our level in the

1970s) and to between 10 and 12 percent of GNP within twenty years (a level far

beneath that of Japan's, but just about on par with the average for today's

industrial countries). By the first decade of the twenty-first century, in

other words, we will have to be rechanneling yearly into investment some $450

billion that we now spend on private and public consumption.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



This broad prescription has implications not only for action but also for

understanding. The question is not the easy and popular one of where to invest

but the brute one, ignored by both political parties, of where to find the

resources. Thus, in the coming election year we need to apply a critical

yardstick to the policy proposals of the presidential candidates: Does this

proposal face up to the long-term problems caused by our neglect of investment

in favor of consumption?<p>



<p>



<p>



Our problems are not, at bottom, economic. We are stymied by our lack of

political consensus on economic policy--something unimaginable to our Japanese

and German trading partners, for whom national consensus (born of national

crisis) informs decisions on savings, investment, productivity-related wage

increases, exports, and money-supply growth.<p>



<p>



<p>



With the proviso that we must put a very large question mark over the capacity

of our political system to deal with the nation's economic problems, I offer

these brief policy suggestions.<p>



<p>



<p>



First, we must tame the federal budget deficit. Real defense spending has been

effectively frozen for the past couple of years, and we may be at a crossroads

in foreign policy which will allow us to make substantial future savings in

security expenditures. Greater sharing of the burden by our NATO allies is

clearly on the horizon; it should proceed proactively, not reactively (that is,

not simply in response to one financial crisis or another). I believe the time

is also right for a historic arms treaty with General Secretary Mikhail

Gorbachev, whose nation's resources are far more severely constrained than ours

and who desperately needs breathing space. The deal I envision would cover the

more costly and, when one considers the size of the Soviet tank armies, more

plausibly threatening conventional forces, as well as strategic weapons. A new

international division of labor remains to be worked out with Japan. The

agreement that I think is needed would have Japan provide, for example, far

more World Bank support, aid not tied to its exports, and more incentives for

major capital flows to Third World countries; further, it would forge a

U.S.-Japan strategic-economic partnership in areas of the world critical to

both countries--Latin America, say. In turn, the United States would continue

to provide military assistance to Japan. Finally, the newly industrializing

countries can no longer simply be beneficiaries of an open world economy. They

must now join the club of the industrial countries and pay their dues,

including aid to the poorer countries.<p>



<p>



<p>



As for domestic spending, we must above all slow the growth in non-means-tested

entitlements, starting with a reform of benefit indexing. Cutting the

non-poverty-benefit cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to 60 percent of the

CPI (a "diet COLA"), for instance, would save about $150 billion in federal

outlays annually by the year 2000. Gradually raising the retirement age and

lowering initial benefits to the relatively well off (for example, those with

histories of high wages) should be combined with the taxation of all benefits

in excess of contributions, which could save well over $50 billion annually by

the year 2000. Note that under this proposal the progressivity of the tax

system would leave intact benefits that go to the poor. There are those who

protest the "humiliation" of the means test; however, these reforms go far

toward honoring the principle of need, doing so implicitly rather than

explicitly.<p>



<p>



<p>



We should also take a more serious look not simply at the unfunded liabilities

of our federal retirement programs but at all the various elements of a

grievously costly fringe-benefit pension program. Civil-service and military

retirement programs should be made part of a total compensation package

comparable to those in the private sector. They should gradually be made

self-supporting (that is, funded as our corporate pension plans are), through a

combination of benefit reductions (with special emphasis on lower initial

benefits and later retirement, as well, of course, as reductions in COLA

indexing) and higher contribution rates. <p>



<p>



<p>



Second, we must act decisively to put a lid on America's excessive and wasteful

consumption of health care, three quarters of which is either funded directly

from public budgets or paid through publicly regulated insurance systems. This

is not the place to enter the thicket of specific health-care reforms, but we

must begin to experiment in earnest with various means by which to replace the

horrendous, indeed perverse, inefficiencies of the current "cost-plus" system

with the discipline of market forces (for example, greater cost-sharing, or the

use of medical vouchers).<p>



<p>



<p>



Third, to the extent that our federal deficits cannot be eliminated in the near

term by simply deciding to spend less, we must increase federal revenue. The

Reagan Administration has steadfastly opposed tax hikes by claiming that they

would permanently sanction an increased "tax burden." But surely the

alternative is worse: to sanction permanently an increased "debt burden." My

choice among revenue options is some form of consumption-based tax. A phased-in

tax on gasoline of twenty-five cents a gallon, for instance, would generate

about $25 billion a year by 1990--and also serve to depress world energy prices

and moderate the now-rapid rise in our oil trade deficit, without destroying

the global competitive position of critical export products such as

petrochemicals. A broad-based five-percent value-added tax on all products

would of course generate considerably more revenue--more than $100 billion in

1990, or enough to halve the federal deficit.<p>



<p>



Fourth, over the longer term we should encourage higher private-sector savings

rates by trading off increases in consumption-based taxes for reductions in

investment-based taxes. Our industrial competitors, after all, have already

adopted the principle that people should be taxed more according to what they

take out of the pot than according to what they put in. Most of those countries

do not tax corporate income twice; most of them do not tax interest, dividends,

and capital gains as ordinary income; and most of them do not allow sweeping

personal exemptions for home-mortgage interest, for employer-paid health care,

and for unearned public retirement benefits. At the same time, all our

industrial competitors have much higher household and corporate savings rates

than we do. It's time our policymakers put two and two together.<p>



<p>



<p>



The least productive enterprise Americans can engage in--though it is virtually

second nature--is trying to place the blame for what has happened to our

economy in the 1980s on one political party or ideology. Blame is beside the

point, for it is something we all share. To be sure, it is easy to find fault

with the conservative fiscal leadership of the current Administration. (Indeed,

I will confidently predict that in the years to come President Reagan will

lament his May, 1985, decision not to support his own party's leadership in its

effort to freeze entitlement COLAs. President Richard Nixon, after all, has

come to lament his decision to sign those COLAs into law.)<p>



<p>



<p>



But, clearly, the liberals and the Democrats are equally to blame. Long before

Reagan entered the White House, liberal opinion leaders persuaded the public to

regard the budget and the tax code as engines of free national consumption. It

was a Democratic Congress that argued in favor of deficit spending for so many

years that no one could recall (with only one budget surplus since 1960) the

rationale behind fiscal balance. And it was a Democratic President who

pioneered the art of disingenuous forecasts (when President Johnson signed the

Medicare Act, he said that an extra $500 million in federal spending would

present "no problem"; today Medicare costs 150 times more than estimated). The

very success that the Democrats enjoyed in promoting consumption, in fact,

persuaded Reagan's conservative backers to dish the Whigs and beat the

opposition at their own game.<p>



<p>



<p>



Reaganomics was founded on a bold new vision for America, yet today--another

irony--we hear every politician who is warming up for the 1988 campaign,

Republican and Democrat alike, complaining about the lack of vision in America.

The reason we feel adrift is that we are waking up to the fact that blind and

self-indulgent gusto is not vision at all but denial. True vision requires the

forging of a farsighted and realistic connection between our present and our

future. It means recognizing in today's choices the sacrifices all of us must

make for posterity. America's unfettered individualism has endowed our people

with enormous energy and great aspirations. It has not, however, given us

license to do anything we please so long as we do it with conviction. <p></blockquote>

	<font size=5>A</font>t a time when numbing public
     discourse portrays the two sexes 
          as though they were wearing numbered jerseys of different 
colors, Rainer Maria Rilke might be balm for exasperated souls. Or maybe 
not. More than any other modernist poet, Rilke gave ironic, tender, and 
sometimes despairing expression to the tumult between modern men and 
women.<BR><blockquote>
Lovers. . . . when you raise yourselves and press<BR>
your mouths together--drink upon drink:<BR>
strange how each of you drinks your way past the other.<P>

But whenever we mean one thing, wholeheartedly, <BR>
another is right there, tugging on ourfeelings. Strife <BR>
is our closest companion. Don't lovers <BR>
constantly tread over each other's 
boundaries, <BR>
after mumbled vows about space,sustenance, and home?<P>
Isn't it time to free ourselves, with love,<BR>
--from the one we love, and, <BR>
trembling, endure . . . ?<BR>
For to stay is to be nowhere at all.<BR></blockquote><p>
These verses are from his late masterpiece, the <I>Duino Elegies</I>, 
which Rilke completed in 1922, the literary <I>annus mirabilis</I> that 
saw the publication of Joyce's <I>Ulysses</I> and Eliot's <I>The Waste 
Land</I>. My stab at translation yields up, I hope, a little of Rilke's 
muscular delicacy, his quality of being at the same time supple and 
ethereal, of molding abstract ideas palpably, like clay. But his poetry is 
troubling (that last verse is a good example), and it's troubling to us in 
ways that a literary modernist like Rilke would not have counted on. 
Behind that lies a complicated tale.<p>
Seventy years after Rilke's death, from leukemia in Switzerland, hastened 
when he pricked his finger on one of his beloved roses, we live in 
modernism's plastic aftermath. Once, the modernists deployed dark energies 
of nihilism and unreason against the hated bourgeoisie; now those same 
energies galvanize a commercial civilization that is voraciously 
accommodating to nihilism and unreason. We hear modernist leitmotifs 
casually whistled down all the highways and byways of everyday life: the 
defiant exaltation of violence (a theme of Gide and Malraux); salvation 
through sex (D. H. Lawrence); private aesthetic pleasure as the highest 
value (Woolf); an ironic nihilism (Mann). We go back and try to relish 
modernism's extremist nose-thumbing at a depersonalizing modernity, and 
soon we feel as though we were celebrating the most disturbing qualities 
of contemporary life. <p>
So we can't really blame Ralph Freedman, Rilke's latest biographer, for 
writing about his subject as if Rilke were just another infuriating 
narcissist who kept turning up at parties. But this account, despite 
Freedman's heroic attempt to weave a narrative out of the voluminous 
material on Rilke, is pretty dismaying. <p>
Rilke was one of the most gifted and conscientious artists who ever 
lived--his motto was "To work is to live without dying." His poetry, 
fiction, and prose embody a search for a way to be good without God, for 
transcendence in a hyper-rationalized world where even death--Rilke 
hated hospitals and the way dying had been stripped of its terrible 
intimacy--was dead. And beyond all that, he was fascinating.<p>


			<img src="./rilke.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 alt=""><p>

Born in 1875 in Prague, Rilke was until he was six or seven got up in 
skirts by his mother, who named him Ren&eacute; and tried to console 
herself for the death of an infant daughter. By the time Rilke was ten, 
his disappointed romantic of a mother had left his father, a kindly but 
ineffectual minor railway official, who had spent some years in the 
Austrian army unsuccessfully seeking commission as an officer. Rilke's 
parents decided to send the young boy to military school, a prospect that 
stirred the father's hopes of turning his son into a soldier. Though he 
later claimed to have loathed military school, the young bohemian warmly 
absorbed the values of discipline, valor, and self-sacrifice into his 
ideal of the defiant artist-hero. He skillfully foiled his father's 
martial expectations, and lack of funds freed the aspiring poet from his 
family's next plans for him: law school. In fact, though he attended 
several universities, soaking up lectures on diverse subjects throughout 
his life, he never graduated from any of them. About such a practical 
matter as a sheepskin, the finest German lyricist since Goethe wrote as an 
adolescent, "And even if I never reach my Arts degree / I'm still a 
scholar, as I wished to be."<p>
W. H. Auden once remarked that would-be poets had better learn a manual 
trade. But Rilke was cast more in the haughty Yeatsian mold that Auden, 
not exactly a day laborer himself, haughtily disdained. And unlike Rilke's 
contemporary Franz Kafka, who performed his tasks as an insurance 
executive with initiative and even enthusiasm, Rilke was too frail 
psychologically to balance his art with the demands of full-time 
employment. Even a desk job in the Austrian army during the First World 
War, when the forty-year-old literary celebrity was conscripted, proved 
too much for him. After three weeks of parade-ground training and living 
in barracks, which nearly killed him, Rilke was assigned to the propaganda 
section. There his literary powers deserted him, and his frustrated 
superiors transferred the stunned poet to the card-filing department, 
where he remained for six months, until his friends interceded and got him 
discharged. Andr&eacute; Malraux he was not. <p>
Rilke's diaries and letters, lively with tales of self-dislike and 
depression, seem to out-Kafka Kafka himself. Still, biographers should 
beware of making too much of these highly polished introspections. Rilke 
conceived of writing as a form of prayer, as Kafka did, and he made 
astringent self-examination a ritualistic prelude to work. Both writers 
magnified their inadequacies, sometimes to the point of a vaunting 
self-regard; it was an efficient way to wrest from their doubts a diligent 
beauty of creation. <p>
Rilke lived on the brink of poverty for much of his life, dependent on the 
good graces of aristocratic and haute-bourgeois patrons in the twilight of 
the Hapsburg Empire. His shaky situation, much as he complained of it, 
suited his temperament as well as did the black clothes he liked to parade 
in during his dandyish younger days in Prague. Like the great German 
mystics, Rilke was a confirmed solitary. Thus he sought to form emotional 
bonds with people more ardently than do those who take their desire to be 
with others for granted. Wandering from person to person and from place to 
place like a pilgrim, he found that patrons offered him, among more 
practical things, a potential shrine of emotional fulfillment. <p>
Rilke spent his life wandering. From an art colony in Germany he migrated 
to a position as Rodin's secretary in Paris; the sculptor eventually 
claimed that the poet was answering letters without his permission and 
summarily dismissed him, as much to Rilke's relief as to his chagrin. From 
Berlin he made two pilgrimages to Russia to meet Tolstoy, on one trip 
going nearly unacknowledged because of a titanic quarrel between the count 
and the countess. He traveled from Italy to Vienna to Spain to Tunisia to 
Cairo. His restless peregrinations had their origins in his epoch, and in 
a temperament forced painfully to choose perfection of the life or of the 
work. Rilke's academic sponsor and friend was Georg Simmel, the celebrated 
German sociologist and philosopher of modernity. In "The Adventurer," one 
of his most famous essays, Simmel argued that only the experience of art 
or adventure could invest time with the significance once lent it by 
religious ritual. The work of both art and adventure had a beginning and 
an end; they were each an "island in life" that briefly imparted a 
transcendent wholeness to experience. And of all possible modern 
adventures, Simmel concluded, the one that most completely combined the 
profoundest elements of life with a momentary apprehension of what lay 
beyond life was the love affair.<p>
Augustine journeyed (unhurriedly) from the fleshpots of Carthage, from 
being in love with love, to the love of God. Rilke, along with other 
adventurers on the threshold of the twentieth century, traveled from God 
to a conviction that the only transcendent principle left was the love, 
erotic and spiritual, between men and women. Rilke's experience as a young 
boy with a feminine persona seems in this sense to have been a great boon. 
<p>
First of all, it provided him with an uncanny empathy for women. His two 
most potent and obsessive literary images were the unrequited female lover 
and the woman artist struggling to find freedom and space for her work. 
But Rilke's liberated feminine side also gave him the gift of unabashed 
openness to his need and desire for the opposite sex. He recalls 
Kierkegaard's description of Mozart's Don Giovanni, who did not 
calculatedly seduce, according to Kierkegaard, but desired seductively. 
What women found irresistible about Rilke was not the effect he had on 
them but the effect they had on him. <p>
Yet to put the burden of salvation solely on relations between men and 
women is to make a life between stumbling, imperfect men and women 
impossible. Rilke had no illusions about the nature of his erotic and 
romantic ideal. It flowed out from and quickly ebbed back into an 
unappeasable inward intensity. Rilke could not love or be loved for long, 
except in the absence of the beloved. After a passionate affair with the 
brilliant and beautiful Lou Andreas-Salom&eacute;, Rilke's muse and 
cicerone on his Russian trips, he suffered pangs of rejection and then 
happily settled into a lifelong correspondence with her. He married the 
sculptress Clara Westhoff when he was twenty-five, lived with her and 
their child for a year, and then by agreement left to take up his 
pilgrimage again. Through periodic reunions, but mostly through a 
voluminous and extraordinary correspondence, they maintained what Rilke 
called an "interior marriage," until emotional reality banged louder and 
louder on their youthful experiment and they eventually grew estranged.<p>
Rilke seems to have passed with relief from the all-consuming rites of 
romance to the half communion, half self-examination of writing letters, 
an activity that also served as a calm precursor of his art. Not 
surprisingly, he was one of the greatest--and most 
self-conscious--letter writers who ever lived. He composed missives 
with a devotional purposiveness. He once wrote a poem about the 
Annunciation in which the angel forgets what he has come to announce 
because he is overwhelmed by Mary's beauty. The implication seems to be 
that communicating through the mail would have been a more fruitful 
procedure. <p>
Rilke loved absolutely, not strenuously or patiently, and therefore his 
love always froze up into a mirror of itself. His condition might have 
been tormented and tormenting--it might appear wearily obnoxious. But 
for Rilke the poet, modern men and women as lovers--their exalted 
expectations and their comi-tragic desperation--came to symbolize 
complex human fate in a world where vertiginous possibilities have 
replaced God and nature. In Rilke's <I>Elegies</I> especially, lovers 
encounter animals, trees, flowers, works of art, puppets, and 
angels--all images, for Rilke, of the absolute fulfillment of desire, 
alongside which the poet placed the tender vaudeville of imperfect human 
wanting. Rilke the man might have presented a painful obstruction to 
himself. But true ardor often springs from an essential deprivation. <p>

<font size=5>R</font>alph Freedman gives a remarkably purposeful account of Rilke's 
deprivation. But he describes none of Rilke's ardor--or his honest 
avowals, or all the discipline and strength and health he needed to draw 
his life's work out of depressions, blocks, and fears, out of his 
contemporary-sounding struggle between a Faustian ego and an endangered 
self. In this biography we don't get Rilke's poetic transformations. We 
get only the modern condition--his and his society's--that he 
poetically transformed and that we've inherited. <p>
Freedman's Rilke, oddly enough, dwells on the dark underside of 
contemporary American life. Behind the mingled, multicolored yarn of his 
passions, obsessions, powerful yearnings, <I>and 
</I>self-interest--all wisely balanced in Donald Prater's majestic and 
definitive 1986 biography--Freedman sees only self-interest. Rilke is 
"hucksterish." His carefully cultivated literary success Freedman 
characterizes as a "relentless career." He refers to Rilke's "careerist 
standards." The places Rilke settles in for a time are not homes but 
Rilke's "bases."<p>
At moments Rilke's awareness of his self-interest amid modern anxieties 
appears uncannily precocious: "The pressures even in the preschooler's 
life were often suffocating. He longed for change." How does Freedman know 
that? I presume he got it from one of the mature Rilke's self-dramatizing 
letters, letters that Freedman paraphrases tendentiously throughout the 
book. That approach has the effect of turning Rilke's harsh and vain 
self-explorations into evidence of the "traumas" that Rilke spent a life 
riddled with "failure" denying. Indeed, Freedman writes enigmatically 
about "Rilke's pattern of living through failure as part of a process that 
turns denial into poetic art." I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds 
like success to me.<p>
But no--if, for Freedman, Rilke is a slick little engine of 
self-advancement, he is also "thin-skinned," "fragile," "depressed," 
"thwarted," "troubled," "distraught," "schizophrenic," and "almost 
suicidal," and he suffered from "hysteria," "anxiety," and "insecurity." 
This poet seems so tightly shackled to his inner condition that we wonder 
how he found the freedom to make his art. Freedman himself only 
occasionally glances at Rilke's art, and then with considerable lack of 
charm, not to say comprehension ("Still addressing the woman's genitals in 
confrontation with the man's, Rilke weighed in with his most devastating 
critique of death's dialectic"). <p>
Freedman's Rilke is an almost wholly psychologized being. He has little 
existence outside his leaden states of mind. We rarely hear about the rich 
medley of artistic and intellectual influences on him--amazingly, 
Simmel's "The Adventurer" never comes up. This is an extreme approach to 
the telling of a poet's life, but Freedman has a method to his extremism. 
As in a rash of recent despoiling biographies--John Fuegi's life of 
Brecht, Michael Shelden's of Graham Greene, Ronald Hayman's of Thomas 
Mann, to name just three--the author shortly puts his cards on the 
table: in this case we are going to meet Rilke the anti-Semite, Rilke the 
secret homosexual, Rilke the sexist. <p>
<font>T</font>he first strut of biographical art to buckle under such an avenging 
mission is language. "Death emasculates," Freedman reports 
dishearteningly. He describes one doubly unlucky fellow as being "fatally 
electrocuted." We find Rilke seeking the "panacea of a cure." Women almost 
never give birth--they just "birth." Clara, Rilke's wife, "was the 
messenger but also the transparent glass and reflecting mirror of Rilke's 
depression." And what a shame that a sentence like this should appear in a 
book about a poet's life: "Like garden flowers opening their petals early 
only to wither quickly, Italy's current art avoided the hard surface 
required for effective poetry." It's as if, somewhere in the deeper 
regions of his writing self, Freedman knows that Rilke wasn't any of the 
bad things his biographer says he was. <p>
One ugly phrase in a personal letter, for instance (out of a vast personal 
correspondence), referring to Franz Werfel as a "Jew-boy," and some murky 
generalities about Werfel's "Jewish attitude toward his work," do not an 
anti-Semite make. Rilke cherished the many Jews he knew, including Simmel; 
he enjoyed reading the Hasidic philosopher Martin Buber and steeped 
himself in Jewish Scripture, claiming that Judaism was closer than 
Christianity to God. He also remained a lifelong champion of Werfel's 
work. And a reader discovers buried deep in Freedman's footnotes that 
Rilke wrote the offending letter to the poet Hugo von Hoffmannsthal, a 
good friend and an important patron. Hoffmannsthal was also Jewish, and he 
shared Rilke's negative views on the superambitious Werfel, who emigrated 
to America and, in 1941, published <I>The Song of Bernadette</I>, a novel 
about a miracle at Lourdes. Freedman doesn't mention that about five 
months  after Rilke wrote the letter to Hoffmannsthal, along with a nearly 
identical letter to his patron Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis, Rilke 
again wrote similar letters to the two of them praising Werfel's poetry so 
exuberantly that they almost sound like retractions of his first 
letters.<p>
Why would an anti-Semite extol a Jewish poet to two of the most powerful 
and influential figures in Central European literary culture--to 
<I>his</I> own patrons? To paraphrase that great Jewish philosopher Thomas 
Aquinas, When you meet a contradiction, make a distinction. But Freedman 
builds from the surface contradiction. For Rilke, he writes, "a cultural 
and sometimes even a social anti-Semitism was part of daily existence." 
Yet aside from the letter to Hoffmannsthal, he offers no evidence for that 
litigable assumption, though he does inform us, with a smug and bizarre 
knowingness, that one of Rilke's Jewish lovers later died at Auschwitz.<p>
With similarly blind zeal Freedman bases his insinuation that Rilke was 
secretly gay on two pieces of evidence: the poet's idealistic adolescent 
pact with another boy at military school, "sealed by a handshake and a 
kiss," as Rilke put it in a letter; and a fictional letter meant for 
publication, which brought Rilke, in Freedman's weasel words, "close to a 
disguised rendering of homosexuality with personal overtones." That's all 
the proof Freedman has.<p>
Well, so what if Rilke happened to be homosexual? I don't see what 
Freedman thinks he is gaining by making a near-assertion and then failing 
to prove it. If there are readers who might be obscurely benefited by the 
revelation of Rilke's homosexuality, they'll be disappointed. If there are 
readers whose identity rests on the affirmation of Rilke's 
heterosexuality, they will be shaken and then cheered. If there are 
readers who couldn't care less about the whole matter, they'll be bored. 
Meanwhile, Rilke's ghost drums its fingers on some eternal windowsill, 
waiting patiently to be evoked.<p>
<font size=5>T</font>his is formidable revisionism. The cumulative effect of such a distortion 
of truth to an admirable, if sadly misplaced, idea of redemption and 
redress is to make Freedman's biography read like a forced confession. But 
the beating heart of Freedman's interminable deconstruction is Rilke the 
sexist. Rilke's extraordinary sensitivity to women, his admiration and 
need for strong and intelligent women, women's love for Rilke--these 
facts Freedman brusquely mentions only to knock down. What he wants is to 
prove that Rilke was a spirited accomplice in European society's 
subjugation of women. He writes, <p>
<blockquote>
The women Rainer chose . . . were themselves practicing artists whose work 
he respected, from Clara to Loulou and now to Baladine-Merline. But they 
were given no choice to remove themselves for the sake of <I>their 
</I>art. . . . Rilke's love imposed a nonreciprocal discipline: in the 
end, it worked only for him and his poetry.<p>
</blockquote>
Throughout 600 pages Freedman gives us encounter after encounter between 
Rilke and the women in his life, in which the women are flawless angels 
and Rilke a consummate villain. If Rilke's dear friend the great German 
painter Paula Modersohn-Becker found herself trapped in a stifling 
marriage, Rilke was a traitor for not extricating her. If Lou 
Andreas-Salom&eacute; told the young Rilke to go off somewhere because one 
of her other lovers was coming to visit, Rilke's anger was the symptom of 
an unbalanced psyche. If the adolescent Rilke broke up with his adolescent 
girlfriend, Valerie von David-Rh&ocirc;nfeld, he was a treacherous 
seducer. Freedman quotes copiously from David-Rh&ocirc;nfeld's embittered 
memoirs--published shortly after Rilke's death--to posit a pattern 
in Rilke's personality. "I came to love that poor unfortunate creature," 
David-Rh&ocirc;nfeld recalls about her teenage sweetheart, "whom everyone 
avoided like a mangy dog." For Freedman, this vindictive picture of Rilke 
provides the "clue" to Rilke's "isolation."<p>
This is all ludicrously unfair. It's certainly unfair to say that Rilke 
didn't give the women he loved and who loved him the "choice to remove 
themselves for the sake of <I>their </I>art." He was in no position to 
give or deny freedom to his independent-minded wife, let alone to any 
woman of whom he was merely a lover. Only their passion, or admiration, or 
use for Rilke bound these women to the famous poet. Often ambitious 
artists themselves, Rilke's lovers expected him to introduce them into his 
heady artistic and intellectual circles and to help them with their 
careers. This he unfailingly did; in one case he helped the careers of a 
former lover's children by her husband. And he offered emotional succor 
long after the amorous flame had waned--not to mention demanding the 
same support for himself. <p>
Rilke's most benevolent patron, Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis, was 
wise enough both to nurture Rilke's gift and to keep her distance from her 
complicated prot&eacute;g&eacute;. An unblinking observer of Rilke's life, 
she was able to see his liaisons for what they were. And she knew how 
Rilke's acute sensitivity to his own condition, combined with his talent 
for self-pity, often landed him in the arms of the wrong people: "You must 
always be seeking out such weeping willows, who are by no means so weepy 
in reality, believe me--<I>you</I> find your <I>own </I>reflection in 
those eyes." But Freedman, doggedly indifferent to the available evidence, 
makes Rilke's lovers and women friends out to be helpless victims of a 
smooth seduction machine. <p>
As for the centerpiece of Freedman's argument for Rilke's sexism--he 
"abandoned" Clara and their daughter, Ruth--here he portrays Clara, 
too, as if she were Tess of the D'Urbervilles. On the contrary. Clara 
enthusiastically seconded Rilke's definition of two artists wedded as 
each, in Rilke's cautiously ambiguous phrase, <A HREF="http://www.igc.apc.org/jillaine/rilke.html">"the guardian of the other's 
solitude."</A> After Rilke left for Paris, she placed Ruth with her wealthy 
and supportive parents and went on a pilgrimage to Egypt, among other 
places. Like Rilke, the adventurous Clara had a fascinating life--I 
don't know why Freedman didn't write her biography. Women artists suffered 
in Rilke's society, but not because of Rilke.<p>
We must understand one another or die. And we will never understand one 
another if we cannot understand the famous dead, those fragments of the 
past who sit half buried and gesturing to us on memory's contested shores. 
But Rilke, as a poet, should have the last word (in Stephen Mitchell's 
beautiful translation):<p>

<blockquote>

<B>Archaic Torso of Apollo</B><p>


We cannot know his legendary head<BR>
with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso<BR>
is still suffused with brilliance from inside,<BR>
like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low,<P>

gleams in all its power. Otherwise<BR>
the curved breast could not dazzle you so, nor could<BR>
a smile run through the placid hips and thighs<BR>
to that dark center where procreation flared.<P>

Otherwise this stone would seem defaced<BR>
beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders<BR>
and would not glisten like a wild beast's fur:<P>

would not, from all the borders of itself,<BR>
burst like a star: for here there is no place<BR>
that does not see you. You must change your life.

<blockquote>
	
<font size=5>O</font>N October 3 of last year the world awaited the 
verdict from a Los Angeles courtroom. That Tuesday was also the opening day of 
the <a href="http://www.poptel.org.uk/labour-party/index-t.html">Labour 
Party's</a> annual
conference at Brighton, and at 6:00 P.M.--10:00 A.M. Pacific Time, when the
jury's decision was due--many of us covering the conference headed for
televisions in bars or hotel rooms. To our astonishment, the BBC led off its
news program not with the O. J. Simpson verdict but with the keynote speech
that Tony Blair, the Labour leader, had given earlier that day. 
Surprise turned into a mixture of irritation and amusement when the full story
emerged. The television companies had been badgered by faxes from Alastair
Campbell, Blair's press secretary: "Whilst I fully understand there is much
interest in the verdict, I would implore you not to lose sight of the news
value and of the importance to the country of Mr Blair's speech." Nor did they
lose sight of it. The BBC did as it was told. This went beyond spin-doctoring.
It was news management worthy of a none-too-democratic Balkan state, or of some
Third World country rejoicing in the "new information order."<p>

The arrogance would have seemed outrageous coming from the Prime Minister's
office. But Blair was not Prime Minister, only behaving as if he were, after
little more than a year--though a triumphant year--as leader of the opposition.
When he became party leader, Labour had been out of office for more than
fifteen years; an entire generation has grown up knowing only <a href="http://www.
conservative-party.org.uk/">Tory</a> rule. Labour
has lost four general elections in succession, a record unprecedented since
well before the advent of universal suffrage. It managed to lose the last
election, in 1992, to what looked like an enfeebled Tory government in the
depths of a recession. Since 1974, when Harold Wilson last won a general
election for Labour, the party has had five leaders, none of whom has won a
general election and four of whom have never been Prime Minister. A British
citizen now needs to be over forty to have voted for a Labour government. <p>

This pattern of failure has seemingly been reversed. Blair became the Labour
leader in July of 1994, at the age of forty-one, projecting glamour, youth,
freshness. His slogan was "modernization," and he unofficially but definitely
renamed his party "New Labour." It may have looked more like a marketing
strategy than a political philosophy, but it worked. Within a year Labour was
so far ahead in the polls that if (in the political commentators' illusory
hypothesis) an election had been held then, the Tories would have suffered the
kind of wipeout their Canadian counterparts experienced not long ago.<p>

Almost more startling than what Blair did was how he did it. He took over a
party all but terminally demoralized by endless defeat, presenting himself as
the man who could make the party electable once more. What wasn't clear at
first was that he meant to do so by utterly transforming the party, by
uprooting its traditions, by effectively destroying Labour as it had been known
since its beginnings. There had long been struggles between the left and the
right of the party, between advanced socialists and cautious reformists, and
some leaders were more radical than others. But Labour had always had a
sentimental tradition to which all paid homage, embodied in totems such as the
state-socialist Clause Four of its old constitution and the singing of "The Red
Flag" at the end of conferences. <p>

<img src="blair.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

Blair is the first Labour leader who barely pretends to be a socialist. He
determined to ditch Clause Four, and duly did so. In the process he caused what
one writer has called "the collapse of Labour as the party of organised
labor"--an outcome that, as the oddly oxymoronic phrase suggests, is as though
the Pope caused the collapse of the Church as the medium of organized
Christianity. Even more brazenly, Blair has courted figures ranking high in the
demonology of the British left, from the rulers of the East Asian "tiger"
countries to the Prince of Darkness himself, Rupert Murdoch. <p>

Above all, he did what no leader of the "progressive" side in British politics
had done since the 1840s. Every Tory leader since Sir Robert Peel had
implicitly agreed with his opponents that the future belonged with their side;
that at best a rearguard action could be fought; that conservatism's role was
to make concessions as slowly, and with as good grace, as possible. That is,
until <a href="http://student.uq.edu.au/~s002479/">Margaret Thatcher</a>.
She was the first Tory leader who did not share this belief. <p>

And Blair agrees with her. He is the first of the Tories' political opponents
ever to concede that <i>they</i> have largely won the argument. An anthology of
Blair's recent reflections speaks for itself.<p>

"I believe Margaret Thatcher's emphasis on enterprise was right."<p>

"A strong society should not be confused with a strong state."<p>

"Duty is the cornerstone of a decent society." <p>

"Britain needs more successful people who can become rich by success through
the money they earn."<p>

"People don't want an overbearing state."<p>

Any of these could have been uttered by a Tory, or by a none-too-liberal
Democrat or, indeed, by a none-too-liberal Republican. Come to think of it,
<a href="http://www.buchanan.org/">Patrick Buchanan's</a> main disagreement with 
the Labour leader would be over
Blair's uncritical admiration for "wealth creators" and free trade. It has been
a breathtaking achievement--but a paradoxical one. Political parties have
changed character before now, and have sometimes been taken over from the
outside. This is a unique and much stranger case: a party has been captured
from the inside, and by a man who in his heart despises most of that party's
traditions and cherished beliefs.<p>

<font size=5>A</font>S parties go, Labour is quite young, much younger than the 
Tories and
than both the Democrats and the Republicans. Its birth isn't easy to pin down.
An Independent Labour Party (independent of the parties then existing, that is)
was born in 1893, shortly after Keir Hardie became the first man to be elected
to Parliament specifically as a labor representative rather than as a "lib-lab"
loosely attached to the Liberal Party. But the ILP remained one of many small
bodies in the larger and looser movement. A Labour Representation Committee was
created in 1900, and formally christened the national Labour Party in 1906.
In those early years any number of different and sometimes conflicting forces
jostled within this movement. <a href="http://www.idbsu.edu/surveyrc/Staff/jaynes
/marxism/marxism.htm">Marxism</a> had struck its roots in England through
the Social Democratic Federation, but not deep or widespread ones. The
<i>Fabian Essays</i>, published in 1889 by seven writers, including
George Bernard Shaw and Sidney Webb, offered an alternative version of
nonrevolutionary bureaucratic socialism. Three radical American writers, Henry
George, Edward Bellamy, and Laurence Gronlund, had perhaps as much influence in
England as in their own country, but ethical and utopian writers such as John
Ruskin and William Morris were more influential still.<p>

With all that, Labour remained what its name said: the political and industrial
voice of the organized working class. Bodies like the ILP and the SDF were
socialist but tiny; the labor or union movement was large but not socialist.
Labour organized unions on the one hand, and on the other increased political
representation for the masses as the franchise was gradually extended to them.
In 1906, twenty-nine Labour MPs were elected, almost all of them workingmen by
origin. And their policy remained what Keir Hardie had set out in 1903: "When
acting in the House of Commons, they should be neither socialists, Liberals,
nor Tories, but a Labour party."<p>

That party waxed as the middle-class Liberals waned, and by the 1920s Labour
had become the chief party opposed to the Tories (whose own survival and
adaptability over 150 years has been one of the most extraordinary stories of
modern European politics). Not until around the time Great Britain finally
granted universal franchise did a Labour government come to power. There were
two Labour governments before the war, in 1924 and 1929-1931, but neither had a
clear majority in Parliament, and both ended in grief, with recriminations and
accusations of betrayal.<p>

By the time it became a party of government, Labour had also formally become a
socialist party. At its 1918 conference it adopted a new constitution,
including the famous Clause Four, which laid down the party's objective:<p> 
<blockquote>
To secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry
and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis
of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange,
and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each
industry and service.</blockquote><p>

The sentence was drafted by Webb, a man who personified the dominant ethos of
the Labour Party, which was Fabian managerialism. With his imperious,
terrifying wife, Beatrice, he believed that the world could be put to rights by
the efficient collection and application of statistics. The two of them were
lampooned by H. G. Wells in his novel <i>The New Machiavelli</i>, though a
couple who could spend their honeymoon attending the Trades Union Congress in
Glasgow were in reality beyond satire. <p>

Like others on the left early in the century, Webb was fascinated by eugenics,
or scientific breeding. In the 1930s he became fascinated by another socialist
experiment, and with Beatrice wrote the adulatory <i>Soviet Communism: A New
Civilisation</i>, which has been described by one historian as "despite severe
competition, the most preposterous book ever written about Soviet Russia." Webb
summed up his political philosophy: "The perfect and fitting development of
each individual is not necessarily the utmost and highest cultivation of his
own personality, but the filling, in the best possible way, of his humble
function in the great social machine." <p>

When Labour finally came to power with a clear parliamentary majority, in 1945,
it acted on Webb's program and in his spirit. The 1945 government was the
apotheosis of bureaucratic socialism, founded on the principles of
collectivism, central economic planning, and redistributive taxation. It
created--or, more accurately, completed--the modern British welfare state,
whose core was the National Health Service and universal benefits, and it also
nationalized the "commanding heights" of the economy--or at least some of those
heights, as they were then seen. But the timing was wrong, and the old
industries that were nationalized, such as railroads and coal mines, though
deeply rooted in the emotional memory of the Labour movement, were already in
decline and soon to be a burden on the nation.<p>

Mid-century saw Labour's high tide. In the 1951 election the party received
more votes than ever before or ever since, and more votes than the Tories. But
owing to the vagaries of the electoral system the Tories won the election, and
remained in office for thirteen years. And in the forty-five years since 1951
Labour has managed to interrupt Tory rule for only two brief periods: 1964-1970 and 1974-1979. After Labour's defeat in 1992 some of us began to believe
that a secular historical tide was sweeping the party away forever, as the
Liberals were swept away before. We were wrong, it seems. For most of 1995 and
1996 Labour has enjoyed a huge lead in the polls, around 30 percent at last
count. A general election must come by next spring and may well come sooner, as
the Major government's slender parliamentary majority evaporates. It is almost
universally assumed that Labour will win it, and many Tory politicians are
already making discreet plans for alternate careers. So reports of the death of
Labour were much exaggerated. Or were they? It might be that the Labour Party
as it has existed for nearly a hundred years has indeed disappeared, with only
its name left behind, like the grin on the face of the disappearing Cheshire
cat.<p>

 <font size=5>A</font>LL of which is one man's work. Anthony Charles Lynton Blair 
 was born in May of 1953. His background is partly conventional, partly romantic. His
father, Leo, was the son of Charles Parsons, a small-time actor, and Celia
Ridgeway, a dancer and a dropout from a rich family. Because they were
unmarried at the time Leo was born, he was adopted by a couple in Scotland
called Blair. Leo grew up poor and had little education, but his gifts emerged
during the war, which he began as a private and ended as a major.
After the war he qualified as a barrister, or trial lawyer, and became a
university law teacher at Durham, where his children grew up. He married a
woman named Hazel Corscaden, the significance of whose background has gone
entirely unremarked. Her family were poor Protestant farmers from County
Donegal, one of the three predominantly Catholic counties of the historic
province of <a href="http://www.nireland.com/">Ulster</a>, which went to the 
Irish Free State when Ireland was
partitioned, and most of whose Protestant minority subsequently departed. Blair
has already moved Labour sharply away from its former "united Ireland" policy,
and my hunch is that the cause of Irish nationalism would get no more of a
hearing from a Blair government than from John Major's. <p>

In the pattern of upward mobility, Leo sent Tony first to Durham Choristers
School (the poet and journalist James Fenton claims to remember him with
avuncular affection), and then to Fettes, a public (private) school in
Edinburgh. It will be a nice irony if Labour gives us the first "public-school
man" as Prime Minister since Harold Macmillan retired in 1963--the subsequent
Tory leaders, Heath, Thatcher, and Major, having all come from backgrounds as
humble as those of their Labour opponents. More to the point, Leo Blair was a
Tory voter for most of his life (though he now loyally supports his son), and
Tony has no Labour roots at all, either in intellectual socialism or in the
broader labor movement. <p>

He went on to <a href="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/archive/ox.html">Oxford</a>, 
where he was a conventional enough undergraduate. He
belonged to one or two dining clubs, he dated a few women, and he played for a
time in a rock band called Ugly Rumours, which he would now rather forget,
though his wife sometimes plays tapes of the band at parties to tease him.
A.C.L. Blair, St. John's College '72 (Oxford dates classes by the first year),
has learned one lesson from W. J. Clinton, University College '68. He flatly
denies that he ever so much as touched, let alone inhaled, any form of illicit
narcotic. A cynic might say that this makes him unique among student rockers of
the 1970s, but that's his story, and it fits the serious and even priggish
picture of young Tony. People who knew him then still tend to think him a bit
of a stick, as the English say: dour, worthy, maybe a little dull.<p>

As interesting as what he did at Oxford is what, apart from drugs, he didn't
do. He had no political interests, never spoke at the Union debating club,
joined no left-wing societies, didn't protest the tail end of the Vietnam war
or Margaret Thatcher's policies as Education Secretary in the 1970-1974 Tory
government, which were a cause of much radical rage at the time. Other than the
law he was studying, his chief interest was religion. An Australian friend,
Peter Thomson, introduced him to the works of John Macmurray, whose <i>Persons
in Relation</i>, <i>The Self as Agent</i>, and other books attempted an amalgam
of Christianity with the politics of "community."<p>

Since then Blair has remained a disciple of Macmurray's, an exponent of
"communitarianism," and a practicing Anglo-Catholic, or "High" Episcopalian.
Americans may not easily realize how unusual this makes him. We have a 
<a href="http://www.churchnet.org.uk/churchnet/home/church_house/"> Church
of England</a> "by law established," and its services are regularly attended by
about three percent of the population of England, which is now the most
irreligious country in the West. Only a minority of British Prime Ministers in
this century have been Christians in any serious sense, and it is possible in
British politics for someone like Thatcher's former lieutenant Norman (Lord)
Tebbit to be both a bareknuckle populist right-winger and a self-proclaimed
atheist--a combination hard to imagine in America. <p>

After Oxford, Blair became a barrister, and practiced for several years in
industrial and employment law. At his law chambers he met another young lawyer,
Cherie Booth, who comes from Liverpool and is the daughter of the actor Tony
Booth, best known for playing the son-in-law of Alf Garnett, the Cockney bigot
in the television comedy <i>Till Death Us Do Part</i>, which inspired, if
that's the word, <i>All in the Family</i>. Blair and Booth married in 1980, and
have two sons and a daughter. Cherie did brilliantly on her bar exams, way
ahead of Blair. She is probably a smarter person than her husband, and
certainly a better lawyer. Last year she "took silk"--the quaint phrase for
when an English barrister joins the Inner Bar, puts "QC," for Queen's Counsel,
after her name, and trebles her fees. <p>

Part of Blair's public good fortune has been timing. In the early 1980s the
Labour Party was in very bad shape. The last Labour government had been a sorry
affair. Harold Wilson resigned as Prime Minister in 1976, abruptly and in a
miasma of scandal, and his successor, James Callaghan, barely hung on until his
government fell apart in 1979. The party was falling apart also, torn between
the social-democratic right and a new left, markedly different from the old
left.<p>

Most great political parties have been coalitions, often of highly disparate
elements. Think of the Democrats in their Rooseveltian heyday--that truly
strange alliance of organized labor, big-city bosses, intellectual liberals,
northern ethnics, and southern segregationists. Labour was no odder than that,
but it was odd enough. It had always been a "broad church" (in a hackneyed
phrase beloved of Wilson), bred from the various strains already described and
stretching from conservative union men, often North Country Methodists or Irish
Catholics, to out-and-out fellow travelers. By the 1970s this had changed.
Stalinism was in eclipse, and a quasi-Trotskyist new left was in the
ascendant.<p>

After the 1979 debacle in which Margaret Thatcher and the Tories won, this
left, led by Tony Benn, very nearly captured the Labour Party, and the old
right peeled off to form the Social Democratic Party. Labour fought the 1983
general election on an ultra-left platform that included withdrawal from the
European Community and unilateral nuclear disarmament. This manifesto was
nicely described by the Labour MP Gerald Kaufman as the longest suicide note in
history, and so it proved. Labour went down to its heaviest defeat (in terms of
seats lost) since 1940.<p>

On the face of it, this was not an auspicious moment to enter Parliament as a
Labour MP, as Tony Blair did, but it meant that he avoided the worst of the
intestine fighting in the party. He had had one dry run the year before,
following a rite of passage in which aspiring politicians begin their careers
by fighting for a hopeless seat. For a Tory this might be a mining constituency
in South Wales or Yorkshire, for a Labour lad or lass a retirement seaside
resort or somewhere in the Home Counties, the outer suburbs of London. Blair
had duly stood for Labour in 1982 in a by-election in Beaconsfield, northwest
of London. <p>

It would have been a lost cause at any time; while Thatcher basked in the glory
of the Falklands war, it was utterly doomed. I covered that by-election
fourteen years ago, and recently turned to my clippings hoping to find some
percipient intimation that one of the candidates might be a future Prime
Minister. Alas, I seem to have been struck mostly by the sameness of the three
candidates, all professional, middle-class Oxford men, with Anthony Blair (as
he was before he chummily Tonified himself) plausible but not electrifying. <p>

He subsequently became the Labour candidate for the safe seat of Sedgefield, in
Durham, but not painlessly. There was a left-wing rival for the nomination, Les
Huckfield, and the way Blair talked his way into being chosen by the local
Labour Party less than three weeks before the general election involved a
mixture of charm, cajolery, mild misrepresentation, and shameless exploitation
of the show-business background of his wife, who, he said in an unfeminist way,
would make a new career in the northeast of England if her husband became an MP
there. (She didn't.) <p>

Shortly after he was elected, there was a Labour rally in Sedgefield, at which
Blair began to outline what was to be his great project. Labour had lost touch
with the people it was meant to represent, he said. It should come to terms
with its defeat and Thatcher's crushing victory. The party must grow out of its
old tribal traditions and modernize itself. He was followed by another speaker,
Dennis Skinner, one of the firebrands of the Labour left, who has for more than
a quarter century bitterly, and sometimes wittily, insulted Tories in the House
of Commons--though he has just as often insulted his party colleagues. <p>

At that meeting Skinner denounced the new MP alongside him for his betrayal of
the socialist cause and then, in a moment of pre-arranged theater, pointed to
Huckfield, who had just strolled into the back of the hall, and shouted that he
was the man who should have been chosen instead of Blair. The left-wingers in
the audience cheered to the echo. Blair suffered his public humiliation in
silence. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that his life since has been
calculated revenge for that moment. <p>

In a parliamentary Labour Party that was not then bursting with talent, Blair
soon shone. He was an official opposition spokesman within a year of becoming
an MP. Following the Labour rout of 1983 the amiable but hopeless Michael Foot
had been succeeded as Labour leader by Neil Kinnock, also amiable and, as it
turned out, not much less hopeless, who duly went on to lose not one but two
elections: in 1987, when everyone expected the Tories to win again under
Thatcher, and in 1992, when many people, including Kinnock, were amazed that
the Tories won under Major. <p>

After that defeat Kinnock resigned and was replaced by yet another amiable man,
John Smith, who was more capable than either of his predecessors and had made
some quiet political headway before he suddenly died of a heart attack in May
of 1994. Blair had bided his time but now went into action with ruthless
effect. He leaned on his contemporary, colleague, and, until then, close
political friend Gordon Brown to stand aside, and won the leadership election
against John Prescott, "old Labour" par excellence, a man of working-class
background, generous emotion, and incoherent eloquence. <p>

Just quite what Blair had in mind was not obvious that summer of 1994, but
there were audible signals in his speeches during the leadership race: "The new
right had struck a chord. There was a perception that there was too much
collective power, too much bureaucracy, too much state intervention, and too
many vested interests created around it." Too much, in other words, of what the
Labour Party had always stood for. Now it was time, Blair said, to move "from
the politics of protest to the politics of government."<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE ruthlessness he had shown in becoming leader was even 
clearer after
July of 1994. He gave a barnstorming performance at his first party conference,
the following October, replete with indistinct but minatory rhetoric of
modernization. And he arranged a special conference to be held in the spring,
to put to rest the hallowed Clause Four. It was duly scrapped, and replaced by
something quite lacking the lucidity of the original, a lengthy, obscure list
of "Aims and Values" that might have been the mission statement of a large
corporation keen to display its social awareness.<p>

Even Blair could not break the party's links with the union movement overnight,
but they have been steadily chipped away. Blair has made it plain that the
unions will enjoy no special favors when he reaches Downing Street: "Unions
should do the job of trade unions. The Labour Party must do the job of
government. The British people expect Labour to govern for the whole country,
and we will." This spring Blair moved to end the arrangement, existing since
Keir Hardie's day, by which unions "sponsor" individual Labour MPs.<p>

All of which may have been understandable enough. It is plainly the case that
by the 1970s the unions had become an arrogant and destructive force, and that
their connection with Labour was politically damaging for the party. When the
Thatcher government curbed the unions' power by removing their privileged
status outside the law (originally conferred by Disraeli, of all people), the
step was welcomed by almost everyone except the union bosses. Any Labour leader
who wants to become Prime Minister must accept that.<p>

He must also accept that heavy taxation is unpopular, that rainbow coalitions
of ethnic and sexual minorities arouse little enthusiasm among ordinary voters,
and that the kind of liberalism that appears better disposed toward criminals
than toward their victims doesn't win many votes either. Hence Blair's
insistence that there will be no return to the taxation rates of the last
Labour government, hence his fulsome tribute to a policeman murdered on duty
and his almost-too-neat promise to be "tough on crime and tough on the causes
of crime." <p>

There is also a growing consensus, way beyond neo- or paleo-conservatism, that
<A HREF="../../../election/connection/family/danquay1.htm">"Dan Quayle was right"</A>: that the hedonistic individualism of the 1960s and
1970s was socially destructive, and that its ultimate victims have been not the
well-to-do bohemians who first propagated it but the poor. Hence also Blair's
language of responsibility, duty, and self-discipline. This was shrewd as well
as sincere.<p>

There was, finally, the need to recognize in intellectual honesty that
traditional command-economy socialism has had its day, and that in every
Western country the traditional industrial proletariat that was the labor
movement's original constituency has dwindled to a minority. All of that was
necessary. But Blair has gone much further--beyond the call of duty or even
ambition, one might say.<p>

Despite his political triumphs, Blair, and the Blairs, have been much mocked,
with obvious comparisons made between Tony and Cherie and Bill and Hillary.
They have the same flavor of radical chic, the same affinity with what we call
the chattering classes, or liberal media folk, and the luvvies, or
self-regarding, mildly progressive show-biz and media folk, and the same
cronyism. Blair's inner court is not at all the same as the official shadow
cabinet. His principal courtiers are Alastair Campbell, a former political
journalist, witnessed earlier twisting the BBC's arm, and Peter Mandelson, a
Labour MP who has earned his spin-doctor's M.D. cum laude and has just written
a hero-worshipping account, <i>The Blair Revolution</i>. <p>

This book does not really explain what form the revolution is going to take
when Blair has to rule the country, as distinct from lecturing it. To the
extent that there is a Blairite political philosophy, its language is either
vague--"community," "solidarity," "cohesion"--or opaque. "Stakeholding" has an
impressive ring but has yet to be satisfactorily defined. Of course there is
territory to be exploited by Blair. Everyone knows that the years since
Margaret Thatcher was first elected (and Ronald Reagan) have seen a widening of
the gap between rich and poor, though most British people are now better off
than they were in 1979, an assertion that isn't true of most Americans. There
is a perception that the social fabric has frayed, with beggars on the streets
and increasing violent crime. Many people claim to have disliked some aspects
of "Thatcherism," even if the claim is a little hypocritical, since they often
went on voting for it. Blair's strategy is to appropriate the economic gains of
the 1980s but to mitigate the worst side effects, differentiating himself from
the Tories by shifts of emphasis, by a rhetoric of community and civic virtue,
and by simply playing on the undoubted disenchantment or weary boredom of the
electorate after seventeen years of Tory rule.<p>

He has not explained in detail what his government would do. Instead he has
conducted a brilliant marketing operation for a product no one quite
understands, known as New Labour--or Labour Lite, as someone has unkindly
called it. And in the process he has lorded it over the party he now leads, and
rubbed his colleagues' noses in it. It was right to recognize (as the
chattering classes are still reluctant to do) that the Tories have some genuine
achievements to their credit in these past seventeen years. It is another thing
to say so in the way Blair does: to insist that "the Thatcher-Reagan
leadership" of the 1980s "got certain things right. A greater emphasis on
enterprise. Rewarding, not penalizing, success. Breaking up vested
interests."<p>

Just as there are ways and ways of saying something, there are places and
places to say it. When Blair accepted an invitation to go to Australia last
summer and address Rupert Murdoch's corporate gathering, it was almost a
calculated insult to his party. Murdoch has been a bitter enemy of Labour, and
his gutter tabloid the <i>Sun </i>has boasted that it won the last election for
the Tories; indeed, its coverage was fantastically tendentious and biased.
Murdoch's minions were a remarkable audience for a Labour leader to address, as
he did in even more remarkable words:<p>

"During the sixties and seventies the left developed, almost in substitution
for its economic prescriptions, which by then were failing, a type of social
individualism that confused, at points at least, liberation from prejudice with
a disregard for moral structures. It fought for racial and sexual equality,
which was entirely right. It appeared indifferent to the family and individual
responsibility, which was wrong.<p>

"There was a real danger, occasionally realized, that single-issue pressure
groups moved into the vacuum. Women's groups wrote the women's policy.
Environmental groups wrote the environmental policy, and so on. This was the
same elsewhere. I remember a telling intervention of a speaker at the
Republican Convention of 1984 in the U.S. asking rhetorically, `When was the
last time you heard a Democrat say <i>no?</i>' It was too close to the truth
for comfort." <p>

When the leader of a party of "the left" approvingly quotes Republicans,
something very funny is going on. <p>

On top of this came a row about the education of the Blairs' son, who is being
sent to an educationally superior Roman Catholic school (Cherie is a Catholic)
across London, rather than to his nearest high school, as the spirit of party
policy, if not its letter, demands. And all the while Blair has imperiously
kept his colleagues in their places, stifling any voices of dissent. He has
appointed a "shadow team" of more than a hundred parliamentary spokesmen--a
ridiculous number considering that there are only 271 Labour MPs in all.<p>

These shadows are expected to voice no independent opinions. When one of them,
Clare Short, thought out loud about the possibility of legalizing cannabis, and
another, Ron Davies, did the same about the Prince of Wales's fitness to rule
(neither topic unknown in public debate), they were silenced and made to recant
in tones worthy of a Stalinist show trial. All in all, there has scarcely been
a moment in the past two years when Blair, given a choice between his party's
doctrines and conciliating what he thinks is public opinion, has not chosen the
latter. <p>

It is no wonder (though fascinating enough) that he is deeply admired by
newspaper columnists on the soft right, like Bernard Levin, or even on the hard
right, like Paul Johnson, both of whom formerly adored Thatcher. No wonder
either that another Tory columnist, William Rees-Mogg, of <i>The Times</i>,
writes with approval of the way that the Blair leadership can now "accept
right-wing policies which Margaret Thatcher did not even contemplate in the
1979 manifesto." <p>

And it is no wonder that Blair's relations with his party are what they are.
Alan Watkins, the doyen of London political journalists, has been writing
weekly since Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister and John Kennedy President. He
observed not long ago that although Labour MPs have gone along with Blair, the
truth is that most of them hate what he is doing to their party. But, then, the
feeling is mutual. Someone who knows him says, "You have to remember that the
great passion in Tony's life is his hatred of the Labour Party." <p>

You also have to remember our old friend English irony as you read that, but it
is not just a joke. Tony Blair's career has been a freak of political nature.
When he was chosen leader, two years ago, the Labour Party was punch-drunk,
demoralized by its miserable run of lost elections, desperate for any chance of
returning to office. The puritanical "culture of defeat" might have permeated
sections of the movement, but the brighter and more ambitious in the party had
not gone into politics to spend a lifetime in opposition. They wanted their
ministerial red boxes and secretaries; they were fed up with waiting in line
for cabs and craved black limos. That meant that they wanted a leader who could
win, and in the process they struck a Faustian bargain.<p>

Except that Faust knew what he was doing. Labour had not truly reckoned with
Blair. The party did not realize just how deep was his contempt for its
traditions, and certainly didn't guess that its first Prime Minister in a
generation will be further to the right not only than any previous Labour
premier but than several postwar Tory premiers. It is an extraordinary
performance, and a political triumph of sorts--but for whom? The life, times,
and government of Tony Blair may yet be seen as Margaret Thatcher's greatest
victory.<p>

<blockquote>
	
<font size=5>O</font>N October 3 of last year the world awaited the 
verdict from a Los Angeles courtroom. That Tuesday was also the opening day of 
the <a href="http://www.poptel.org.uk/labour-party/index-t.html">Labour 
Party's</a> annual
conference at Brighton, and at 6:00 P.M.--10:00 A.M. Pacific Time, when the
jury's decision was due--many of us covering the conference headed for
televisions in bars or hotel rooms. To our astonishment, the BBC led off its
news program not with the O. J. Simpson verdict but with the keynote speech
that Tony Blair, the Labour leader, had given earlier that day. 
Surprise turned into a mixture of irritation and amusement when the full story
emerged. The television companies had been badgered by faxes from Alastair
Campbell, Blair's press secretary: "Whilst I fully understand there is much
interest in the verdict, I would implore you not to lose sight of the news
value and of the importance to the country of Mr Blair's speech." Nor did they
lose sight of it. The BBC did as it was told. This went beyond spin-doctoring.
It was news management worthy of a none-too-democratic Balkan state, or of some
Third World country rejoicing in the "new information order."<p>

The arrogance would have seemed outrageous coming from the Prime Minister's
office. But Blair was not Prime Minister, only behaving as if he were, after
little more than a year--though a triumphant year--as leader of the opposition.
When he became party leader, Labour had been out of office for more than
fifteen years; an entire generation has grown up knowing only <a href="http://www.
conservative-party.org.uk/">Tory</a> rule. Labour
has lost four general elections in succession, a record unprecedented since
well before the advent of universal suffrage. It managed to lose the last
election, in 1992, to what looked like an enfeebled Tory government in the
depths of a recession. Since 1974, when Harold Wilson last won a general
election for Labour, the party has had five leaders, none of whom has won a
general election and four of whom have never been Prime Minister. A British
citizen now needs to be over forty to have voted for a Labour government. <p>

This pattern of failure has seemingly been reversed. Blair became the Labour
leader in July of 1994, at the age of forty-one, projecting glamour, youth,
freshness. His slogan was "modernization," and he unofficially but definitely
renamed his party "New Labour." It may have looked more like a marketing
strategy than a political philosophy, but it worked. Within a year Labour was
so far ahead in the polls that if (in the political commentators' illusory
hypothesis) an election had been held then, the Tories would have suffered the
kind of wipeout their Canadian counterparts experienced not long ago.<p>

Almost more startling than what Blair did was how he did it. He took over a
party all but terminally demoralized by endless defeat, presenting himself as
the man who could make the party electable once more. What wasn't clear at
first was that he meant to do so by utterly transforming the party, by
uprooting its traditions, by effectively destroying Labour as it had been known
since its beginnings. There had long been struggles between the left and the
right of the party, between advanced socialists and cautious reformists, and
some leaders were more radical than others. But Labour had always had a
sentimental tradition to which all paid homage, embodied in totems such as the
state-socialist Clause Four of its old constitution and the singing of "The Red
Flag" at the end of conferences. <p>

<img src="blair.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

Blair is the first Labour leader who barely pretends to be a socialist. He
determined to ditch Clause Four, and duly did so. In the process he caused what
one writer has called "the collapse of Labour as the party of organised
labor"--an outcome that, as the oddly oxymoronic phrase suggests, is as though
the Pope caused the collapse of the Church as the medium of organized
Christianity. Even more brazenly, Blair has courted figures ranking high in the
demonology of the British left, from the rulers of the East Asian "tiger"
countries to the Prince of Darkness himself, Rupert Murdoch. <p>

Above all, he did what no leader of the "progressive" side in British politics
had done since the 1840s. Every Tory leader since Sir Robert Peel had
implicitly agreed with his opponents that the future belonged with their side;
that at best a rearguard action could be fought; that conservatism's role was
to make concessions as slowly, and with as good grace, as possible. That is,
until <a href="http://student.uq.edu.au/~s002479/">Margaret Thatcher</a>.
She was the first Tory leader who did not share this belief. <p>

And Blair agrees with her. He is the first of the Tories' political opponents
ever to concede that <i>they</i> have largely won the argument. An anthology of
Blair's recent reflections speaks for itself.<p>

"I believe Margaret Thatcher's emphasis on enterprise was right."<p>

"A strong society should not be confused with a strong state."<p>

"Duty is the cornerstone of a decent society." <p>

"Britain needs more successful people who can become rich by success through
the money they earn."<p>

"People don't want an overbearing state."<p>

Any of these could have been uttered by a Tory, or by a none-too-liberal
Democrat or, indeed, by a none-too-liberal Republican. Come to think of it,
<a href="http://www.buchanan.org/">Patrick Buchanan's</a> main disagreement with 
the Labour leader would be over
Blair's uncritical admiration for "wealth creators" and free trade. It has been
a breathtaking achievement--but a paradoxical one. Political parties have
changed character before now, and have sometimes been taken over from the
outside. This is a unique and much stranger case: a party has been captured
from the inside, and by a man who in his heart despises most of that party's
traditions and cherished beliefs.<p>

<font size=5>A</font>S parties go, Labour is quite young, much younger than the 
Tories and
than both the Democrats and the Republicans. Its birth isn't easy to pin down.
An Independent Labour Party (independent of the parties then existing, that is)
was born in 1893, shortly after Keir Hardie became the first man to be elected
to Parliament specifically as a labor representative rather than as a "lib-lab"
loosely attached to the Liberal Party. But the ILP remained one of many small
bodies in the larger and looser movement. A Labour Representation Committee was
created in 1900, and formally christened the national Labour Party in 1906.
In those early years any number of different and sometimes conflicting forces
jostled within this movement. <a href="http://www.idbsu.edu/surveyrc/Staff/jaynes
/marxism/marxism.htm">Marxism</a> had struck its roots in England through
the Social Democratic Federation, but not deep or widespread ones. The
<i>Fabian Essays</i>, published in 1889 by seven writers, including
George Bernard Shaw and Sidney Webb, offered an alternative version of
nonrevolutionary bureaucratic socialism. Three radical American writers, Henry
George, Edward Bellamy, and Laurence Gronlund, had perhaps as much influence in
England as in their own country, but ethical and utopian writers such as John
Ruskin and William Morris were more influential still.<p>

With all that, Labour remained what its name said: the political and industrial
voice of the organized working class. Bodies like the ILP and the SDF were
socialist but tiny; the labor or union movement was large but not socialist.
Labour organized unions on the one hand, and on the other increased political
representation for the masses as the franchise was gradually extended to them.
In 1906, twenty-nine Labour MPs were elected, almost all of them workingmen by
origin. And their policy remained what Keir Hardie had set out in 1903: "When
acting in the House of Commons, they should be neither socialists, Liberals,
nor Tories, but a Labour party."<p>

That party waxed as the middle-class Liberals waned, and by the 1920s Labour
had become the chief party opposed to the Tories (whose own survival and
adaptability over 150 years has been one of the most extraordinary stories of
modern European politics). Not until around the time Great Britain finally
granted universal franchise did a Labour government come to power. There were
two Labour governments before the war, in 1924 and 1929-1931, but neither had a
clear majority in Parliament, and both ended in grief, with recriminations and
accusations of betrayal.<p>

By the time it became a party of government, Labour had also formally become a
socialist party. At its 1918 conference it adopted a new constitution,
including the famous Clause Four, which laid down the party's objective:<p> 
<blockquote>
To secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry
and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis
of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange,
and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each
industry and service.</blockquote><p>

The sentence was drafted by Webb, a man who personified the dominant ethos of
the Labour Party, which was Fabian managerialism. With his imperious,
terrifying wife, Beatrice, he believed that the world could be put to rights by
the efficient collection and application of statistics. The two of them were
lampooned by H. G. Wells in his novel <i>The New Machiavelli</i>, though a
couple who could spend their honeymoon attending the Trades Union Congress in
Glasgow were in reality beyond satire. <p>

Like others on the left early in the century, Webb was fascinated by eugenics,
or scientific breeding. In the 1930s he became fascinated by another socialist
experiment, and with Beatrice wrote the adulatory <i>Soviet Communism: A New
Civilisation</i>, which has been described by one historian as "despite severe
competition, the most preposterous book ever written about Soviet Russia." Webb
summed up his political philosophy: "The perfect and fitting development of
each individual is not necessarily the utmost and highest cultivation of his
own personality, but the filling, in the best possible way, of his humble
function in the great social machine." <p>

When Labour finally came to power with a clear parliamentary majority, in 1945,
it acted on Webb's program and in his spirit. The 1945 government was the
apotheosis of bureaucratic socialism, founded on the principles of
collectivism, central economic planning, and redistributive taxation. It
created--or, more accurately, completed--the modern British welfare state,
whose core was the National Health Service and universal benefits, and it also
nationalized the "commanding heights" of the economy--or at least some of those
heights, as they were then seen. But the timing was wrong, and the old
industries that were nationalized, such as railroads and coal mines, though
deeply rooted in the emotional memory of the Labour movement, were already in
decline and soon to be a burden on the nation.<p>

Mid-century saw Labour's high tide. In the 1951 election the party received
more votes than ever before or ever since, and more votes than the Tories. But
owing to the vagaries of the electoral system the Tories won the election, and
remained in office for thirteen years. And in the forty-five years since 1951
Labour has managed to interrupt Tory rule for only two brief periods: 1964-1970 and 1974-1979. After Labour's defeat in 1992 some of us began to believe
that a secular historical tide was sweeping the party away forever, as the
Liberals were swept away before. We were wrong, it seems. For most of 1995 and
1996 Labour has enjoyed a huge lead in the polls, around 30 percent at last
count. A general election must come by next spring and may well come sooner, as
the Major government's slender parliamentary majority evaporates. It is almost
universally assumed that Labour will win it, and many Tory politicians are
already making discreet plans for alternate careers. So reports of the death of
Labour were much exaggerated. Or were they? It might be that the Labour Party
as it has existed for nearly a hundred years has indeed disappeared, with only
its name left behind, like the grin on the face of the disappearing Cheshire
cat.<p>

 <font size=5>A</font>LL of which is one man's work. Anthony Charles Lynton Blair 
 was born in May of 1953. His background is partly conventional, partly romantic. His
father, Leo, was the son of Charles Parsons, a small-time actor, and Celia
Ridgeway, a dancer and a dropout from a rich family. Because they were
unmarried at the time Leo was born, he was adopted by a couple in Scotland
called Blair. Leo grew up poor and had little education, but his gifts emerged
during the war, which he began as a private and ended as a major.
After the war he qualified as a barrister, or trial lawyer, and became a
university law teacher at Durham, where his children grew up. He married a
woman named Hazel Corscaden, the significance of whose background has gone
entirely unremarked. Her family were poor Protestant farmers from County
Donegal, one of the three predominantly Catholic counties of the historic
province of <a href="http://www.nireland.com/">Ulster</a>, which went to the 
Irish Free State when Ireland was
partitioned, and most of whose Protestant minority subsequently departed. Blair
has already moved Labour sharply away from its former "united Ireland" policy,
and my hunch is that the cause of Irish nationalism would get no more of a
hearing from a Blair government than from John Major's. <p>

In the pattern of upward mobility, Leo sent Tony first to Durham Choristers
School (the poet and journalist James Fenton claims to remember him with
avuncular affection), and then to Fettes, a public (private) school in
Edinburgh. It will be a nice irony if Labour gives us the first "public-school
man" as Prime Minister since Harold Macmillan retired in 1963--the subsequent
Tory leaders, Heath, Thatcher, and Major, having all come from backgrounds as
humble as those of their Labour opponents. More to the point, Leo Blair was a
Tory voter for most of his life (though he now loyally supports his son), and
Tony has no Labour roots at all, either in intellectual socialism or in the
broader labor movement. <p>

He went on to <a href="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/archive/ox.html">Oxford</a>, 
where he was a conventional enough undergraduate. He
belonged to one or two dining clubs, he dated a few women, and he played for a
time in a rock band called Ugly Rumours, which he would now rather forget,
though his wife sometimes plays tapes of the band at parties to tease him.
A.C.L. Blair, St. John's College '72 (Oxford dates classes by the first year),
has learned one lesson from W. J. Clinton, University College '68. He flatly
denies that he ever so much as touched, let alone inhaled, any form of illicit
narcotic. A cynic might say that this makes him unique among student rockers of
the 1970s, but that's his story, and it fits the serious and even priggish
picture of young Tony. People who knew him then still tend to think him a bit
of a stick, as the English say: dour, worthy, maybe a little dull.<p>

As interesting as what he did at Oxford is what, apart from drugs, he didn't
do. He had no political interests, never spoke at the Union debating club,
joined no left-wing societies, didn't protest the tail end of the Vietnam war
or Margaret Thatcher's policies as Education Secretary in the 1970-1974 Tory
government, which were a cause of much radical rage at the time. Other than the
law he was studying, his chief interest was religion. An Australian friend,
Peter Thomson, introduced him to the works of John Macmurray, whose <i>Persons
in Relation</i>, <i>The Self as Agent</i>, and other books attempted an amalgam
of Christianity with the politics of "community."<p>

Since then Blair has remained a disciple of Macmurray's, an exponent of
"communitarianism," and a practicing Anglo-Catholic, or "High" Episcopalian.
Americans may not easily realize how unusual this makes him. We have a 
<a href="http://www.churchnet.org.uk/churchnet/home/church_house/"> Church
of England</a> "by law established," and its services are regularly attended by
about three percent of the population of England, which is now the most
irreligious country in the West. Only a minority of British Prime Ministers in
this century have been Christians in any serious sense, and it is possible in
British politics for someone like Thatcher's former lieutenant Norman (Lord)
Tebbit to be both a bareknuckle populist right-winger and a self-proclaimed
atheist--a combination hard to imagine in America. <p>

After Oxford, Blair became a barrister, and practiced for several years in
industrial and employment law. At his law chambers he met another young lawyer,
Cherie Booth, who comes from Liverpool and is the daughter of the actor Tony
Booth, best known for playing the son-in-law of Alf Garnett, the Cockney bigot
in the television comedy <i>Till Death Us Do Part</i>, which inspired, if
that's the word, <i>All in the Family</i>. Blair and Booth married in 1980, and
have two sons and a daughter. Cherie did brilliantly on her bar exams, way
ahead of Blair. She is probably a smarter person than her husband, and
certainly a better lawyer. Last year she "took silk"--the quaint phrase for
when an English barrister joins the Inner Bar, puts "QC," for Queen's Counsel,
after her name, and trebles her fees. <p>

Part of Blair's public good fortune has been timing. In the early 1980s the
Labour Party was in very bad shape. The last Labour government had been a sorry
affair. Harold Wilson resigned as Prime Minister in 1976, abruptly and in a
miasma of scandal, and his successor, James Callaghan, barely hung on until his
government fell apart in 1979. The party was falling apart also, torn between
the social-democratic right and a new left, markedly different from the old
left.<p>

Most great political parties have been coalitions, often of highly disparate
elements. Think of the Democrats in their Rooseveltian heyday--that truly
strange alliance of organized labor, big-city bosses, intellectual liberals,
northern ethnics, and southern segregationists. Labour was no odder than that,
but it was odd enough. It had always been a "broad church" (in a hackneyed
phrase beloved of Wilson), bred from the various strains already described and
stretching from conservative union men, often North Country Methodists or Irish
Catholics, to out-and-out fellow travelers. By the 1970s this had changed.
Stalinism was in eclipse, and a quasi-Trotskyist new left was in the
ascendant.<p>

After the 1979 debacle in which Margaret Thatcher and the Tories won, this
left, led by Tony Benn, very nearly captured the Labour Party, and the old
right peeled off to form the Social Democratic Party. Labour fought the 1983
general election on an ultra-left platform that included withdrawal from the
European Community and unilateral nuclear disarmament. This manifesto was
nicely described by the Labour MP Gerald Kaufman as the longest suicide note in
history, and so it proved. Labour went down to its heaviest defeat (in terms of
seats lost) since 1940.<p>

On the face of it, this was not an auspicious moment to enter Parliament as a
Labour MP, as Tony Blair did, but it meant that he avoided the worst of the
intestine fighting in the party. He had had one dry run the year before,
following a rite of passage in which aspiring politicians begin their careers
by fighting for a hopeless seat. For a Tory this might be a mining constituency
in South Wales or Yorkshire, for a Labour lad or lass a retirement seaside
resort or somewhere in the Home Counties, the outer suburbs of London. Blair
had duly stood for Labour in 1982 in a by-election in Beaconsfield, northwest
of London. <p>

It would have been a lost cause at any time; while Thatcher basked in the glory
of the Falklands war, it was utterly doomed. I covered that by-election
fourteen years ago, and recently turned to my clippings hoping to find some
percipient intimation that one of the candidates might be a future Prime
Minister. Alas, I seem to have been struck mostly by the sameness of the three
candidates, all professional, middle-class Oxford men, with Anthony Blair (as
he was before he chummily Tonified himself) plausible but not electrifying. <p>

He subsequently became the Labour candidate for the safe seat of Sedgefield, in
Durham, but not painlessly. There was a left-wing rival for the nomination, Les
Huckfield, and the way Blair talked his way into being chosen by the local
Labour Party less than three weeks before the general election involved a
mixture of charm, cajolery, mild misrepresentation, and shameless exploitation
of the show-business background of his wife, who, he said in an unfeminist way,
would make a new career in the northeast of England if her husband became an MP
there. (She didn't.) <p>

Shortly after he was elected, there was a Labour rally in Sedgefield, at which
Blair began to outline what was to be his great project. Labour had lost touch
with the people it was meant to represent, he said. It should come to terms
with its defeat and Thatcher's crushing victory. The party must grow out of its
old tribal traditions and modernize itself. He was followed by another speaker,
Dennis Skinner, one of the firebrands of the Labour left, who has for more than
a quarter century bitterly, and sometimes wittily, insulted Tories in the House
of Commons--though he has just as often insulted his party colleagues. <p>

At that meeting Skinner denounced the new MP alongside him for his betrayal of
the socialist cause and then, in a moment of pre-arranged theater, pointed to
Huckfield, who had just strolled into the back of the hall, and shouted that he
was the man who should have been chosen instead of Blair. The left-wingers in
the audience cheered to the echo. Blair suffered his public humiliation in
silence. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that his life since has been
calculated revenge for that moment. <p>

In a parliamentary Labour Party that was not then bursting with talent, Blair
soon shone. He was an official opposition spokesman within a year of becoming
an MP. Following the Labour rout of 1983 the amiable but hopeless Michael Foot
had been succeeded as Labour leader by Neil Kinnock, also amiable and, as it
turned out, not much less hopeless, who duly went on to lose not one but two
elections: in 1987, when everyone expected the Tories to win again under
Thatcher, and in 1992, when many people, including Kinnock, were amazed that
the Tories won under Major. <p>

After that defeat Kinnock resigned and was replaced by yet another amiable man,
John Smith, who was more capable than either of his predecessors and had made
some quiet political headway before he suddenly died of a heart attack in May
of 1994. Blair had bided his time but now went into action with ruthless
effect. He leaned on his contemporary, colleague, and, until then, close
political friend Gordon Brown to stand aside, and won the leadership election
against John Prescott, "old Labour" par excellence, a man of working-class
background, generous emotion, and incoherent eloquence. <p>

Just quite what Blair had in mind was not obvious that summer of 1994, but
there were audible signals in his speeches during the leadership race: "The new
right had struck a chord. There was a perception that there was too much
collective power, too much bureaucracy, too much state intervention, and too
many vested interests created around it." Too much, in other words, of what the
Labour Party had always stood for. Now it was time, Blair said, to move "from
the politics of protest to the politics of government."<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE ruthlessness he had shown in becoming leader was even 
clearer after
July of 1994. He gave a barnstorming performance at his first party conference,
the following October, replete with indistinct but minatory rhetoric of
modernization. And he arranged a special conference to be held in the spring,
to put to rest the hallowed Clause Four. It was duly scrapped, and replaced by
something quite lacking the lucidity of the original, a lengthy, obscure list
of "Aims and Values" that might have been the mission statement of a large
corporation keen to display its social awareness.<p>

Even Blair could not break the party's links with the union movement overnight,
but they have been steadily chipped away. Blair has made it plain that the
unions will enjoy no special favors when he reaches Downing Street: "Unions
should do the job of trade unions. The Labour Party must do the job of
government. The British people expect Labour to govern for the whole country,
and we will." This spring Blair moved to end the arrangement, existing since
Keir Hardie's day, by which unions "sponsor" individual Labour MPs.<p>

All of which may have been understandable enough. It is plainly the case that
by the 1970s the unions had become an arrogant and destructive force, and that
their connection with Labour was politically damaging for the party. When the
Thatcher government curbed the unions' power by removing their privileged
status outside the law (originally conferred by Disraeli, of all people), the
step was welcomed by almost everyone except the union bosses. Any Labour leader
who wants to become Prime Minister must accept that.<p>

He must also accept that heavy taxation is unpopular, that rainbow coalitions
of ethnic and sexual minorities arouse little enthusiasm among ordinary voters,
and that the kind of liberalism that appears better disposed toward criminals
than toward their victims doesn't win many votes either. Hence Blair's
insistence that there will be no return to the taxation rates of the last
Labour government, hence his fulsome tribute to a policeman murdered on duty
and his almost-too-neat promise to be "tough on crime and tough on the causes
of crime." <p>

There is also a growing consensus, way beyond neo- or paleo-conservatism, that
<A HREF="../../../election/connection/family/danquay1.htm">"Dan Quayle was right"</A>: that the hedonistic individualism of the 1960s and
1970s was socially destructive, and that its ultimate victims have been not the
well-to-do bohemians who first propagated it but the poor. Hence also Blair's
language of responsibility, duty, and self-discipline. This was shrewd as well
as sincere.<p>

There was, finally, the need to recognize in intellectual honesty that
traditional command-economy socialism has had its day, and that in every
Western country the traditional industrial proletariat that was the labor
movement's original constituency has dwindled to a minority. All of that was
necessary. But Blair has gone much further--beyond the call of duty or even
ambition, one might say.<p>

Despite his political triumphs, Blair, and the Blairs, have been much mocked,
with obvious comparisons made between Tony and Cherie and Bill and Hillary.
They have the same flavor of radical chic, the same affinity with what we call
the chattering classes, or liberal media folk, and the luvvies, or
self-regarding, mildly progressive show-biz and media folk, and the same
cronyism. Blair's inner court is not at all the same as the official shadow
cabinet. His principal courtiers are Alastair Campbell, a former political
journalist, witnessed earlier twisting the BBC's arm, and Peter Mandelson, a
Labour MP who has earned his spin-doctor's M.D. cum laude and has just written
a hero-worshipping account, <i>The Blair Revolution</i>. <p>

This book does not really explain what form the revolution is going to take
when Blair has to rule the country, as distinct from lecturing it. To the
extent that there is a Blairite political philosophy, its language is either
vague--"community," "solidarity," "cohesion"--or opaque. "Stakeholding" has an
impressive ring but has yet to be satisfactorily defined. Of course there is
territory to be exploited by Blair. Everyone knows that the years since
Margaret Thatcher was first elected (and Ronald Reagan) have seen a widening of
the gap between rich and poor, though most British people are now better off
than they were in 1979, an assertion that isn't true of most Americans. There
is a perception that the social fabric has frayed, with beggars on the streets
and increasing violent crime. Many people claim to have disliked some aspects
of "Thatcherism," even if the claim is a little hypocritical, since they often
went on voting for it. Blair's strategy is to appropriate the economic gains of
the 1980s but to mitigate the worst side effects, differentiating himself from
the Tories by shifts of emphasis, by a rhetoric of community and civic virtue,
and by simply playing on the undoubted disenchantment or weary boredom of the
electorate after seventeen years of Tory rule.<p>

He has not explained in detail what his government would do. Instead he has
conducted a brilliant marketing operation for a product no one quite
understands, known as New Labour--or Labour Lite, as someone has unkindly
called it. And in the process he has lorded it over the party he now leads, and
rubbed his colleagues' noses in it. It was right to recognize (as the
chattering classes are still reluctant to do) that the Tories have some genuine
achievements to their credit in these past seventeen years. It is another thing
to say so in the way Blair does: to insist that "the Thatcher-Reagan
leadership" of the 1980s "got certain things right. A greater emphasis on
enterprise. Rewarding, not penalizing, success. Breaking up vested
interests."<p>

Just as there are ways and ways of saying something, there are places and
places to say it. When Blair accepted an invitation to go to Australia last
summer and address Rupert Murdoch's corporate gathering, it was almost a
calculated insult to his party. Murdoch has been a bitter enemy of Labour, and
his gutter tabloid the <i>Sun </i>has boasted that it won the last election for
the Tories; indeed, its coverage was fantastically tendentious and biased.
Murdoch's minions were a remarkable audience for a Labour leader to address, as
he did in even more remarkable words:<p>

"During the sixties and seventies the left developed, almost in substitution
for its economic prescriptions, which by then were failing, a type of social
individualism that confused, at points at least, liberation from prejudice with
a disregard for moral structures. It fought for racial and sexual equality,
which was entirely right. It appeared indifferent to the family and individual
responsibility, which was wrong.<p>

"There was a real danger, occasionally realized, that single-issue pressure
groups moved into the vacuum. Women's groups wrote the women's policy.
Environmental groups wrote the environmental policy, and so on. This was the
same elsewhere. I remember a telling intervention of a speaker at the
Republican Convention of 1984 in the U.S. asking rhetorically, `When was the
last time you heard a Democrat say <i>no?</i>' It was too close to the truth
for comfort." <p>

When the leader of a party of "the left" approvingly quotes Republicans,
something very funny is going on. <p>

On top of this came a row about the education of the Blairs' son, who is being
sent to an educationally superior Roman Catholic school (Cherie is a Catholic)
across London, rather than to his nearest high school, as the spirit of party
policy, if not its letter, demands. And all the while Blair has imperiously
kept his colleagues in their places, stifling any voices of dissent. He has
appointed a "shadow team" of more than a hundred parliamentary spokesmen--a
ridiculous number considering that there are only 271 Labour MPs in all.<p>

These shadows are expected to voice no independent opinions. When one of them,
Clare Short, thought out loud about the possibility of legalizing cannabis, and
another, Ron Davies, did the same about the Prince of Wales's fitness to rule
(neither topic unknown in public debate), they were silenced and made to recant
in tones worthy of a Stalinist show trial. All in all, there has scarcely been
a moment in the past two years when Blair, given a choice between his party's
doctrines and conciliating what he thinks is public opinion, has not chosen the
latter. <p>

It is no wonder (though fascinating enough) that he is deeply admired by
newspaper columnists on the soft right, like Bernard Levin, or even on the hard
right, like Paul Johnson, both of whom formerly adored Thatcher. No wonder
either that another Tory columnist, William Rees-Mogg, of <i>The Times</i>,
writes with approval of the way that the Blair leadership can now "accept
right-wing policies which Margaret Thatcher did not even contemplate in the
1979 manifesto." <p>

And it is no wonder that Blair's relations with his party are what they are.
Alan Watkins, the doyen of London political journalists, has been writing
weekly since Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister and John Kennedy President. He
observed not long ago that although Labour MPs have gone along with Blair, the
truth is that most of them hate what he is doing to their party. But, then, the
feeling is mutual. Someone who knows him says, "You have to remember that the
great passion in Tony's life is his hatred of the Labour Party." <p>

You also have to remember our old friend English irony as you read that, but it
is not just a joke. Tony Blair's career has been a freak of political nature.
When he was chosen leader, two years ago, the Labour Party was punch-drunk,
demoralized by its miserable run of lost elections, desperate for any chance of
returning to office. The puritanical "culture of defeat" might have permeated
sections of the movement, but the brighter and more ambitious in the party had
not gone into politics to spend a lifetime in opposition. They wanted their
ministerial red boxes and secretaries; they were fed up with waiting in line
for cabs and craved black limos. That meant that they wanted a leader who could
win, and in the process they struck a Faustian bargain.<p>

Except that Faust knew what he was doing. Labour had not truly reckoned with
Blair. The party did not realize just how deep was his contempt for its
traditions, and certainly didn't guess that its first Prime Minister in a
generation will be further to the right not only than any previous Labour
premier but than several postwar Tory premiers. It is an extraordinary
performance, and a political triumph of sorts--but for whom? The life, times,
and government of Tony Blair may yet be seen as Margaret Thatcher's greatest
victory.<p>

	<font size=5>E</font>very generation requires a strategy for its old age. An odd and chilling
folktale that has been recited throughout Europe since the thirteenth century
shows how far-reaching the repercussions of such strategies can be. "The Tale
of the Ungrateful Son" begins with a description of an old merchant who day by
day grows more infirm. The old man's wife has long since passed away, and he is
miserably lonely. Fearing that he will soon lose his powers of mind, the old
man finally decides to ask his middle-aged son and daughter-in-law if he might
move in with their family in the country.<p>

<p>

At first the couple is overjoyed, for by way of compensation the merchant
promises to bequeath his small fortune to them before he dies. But the old man
in his dotage becomes increasingly troublesome to clean and feed. Eventually
his daughter-in-law grows resentful of his constant needs and senile chatter.
Indeed, she harangues her husband night and day, until he reluctantly agrees
that the time has come to take the old man to the barn.<p>

<p>

The ungrateful son is too embarrassed, however, to confront his father directly
with his shameful decision. He gives that chore to his own youngest child.<p>

<p>

"Take your grandfather to the barn and wrap him in the best horse blanket we
have on the farm," he tells the boy. "That way the old man will be as
comfortable as possible until he dies."<p>

<p>

With tears in his eyes the child does as he is told, except that, having
selected the farm's best horse blanket, he tears it in half. He uses one part
to swaddle his beloved grandfather but sets the other part aside. The
merchant's son is furious when he learns what his child has done. "What sort of
boy are you who would put his own grandfather out in the barn to freeze with
only half a horse blanket?" he shouts.<p>

<p>

"But father," the child replies, "I am saving the other half for you."<p>

<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=4><b>T</font></b>HE amount of help that each generation requires from its children may vary,
but the demand for assistance in old age never vanishes. Today Social Security
and Medicare are all but universal programs, with the typical recipient
collecting benefits costing at least three times as much as the taxes he or she
contributed. This year nearly 28 percent of all federal spending is going to
the 11 percent of the population that is sixty-five and older. The budgets for
all of the federal government's various retirement programs, including
Medicare, are four and a half times bigger than the budgets for means-tested
welfare programs.<p>

<p>

Despite the huge cost of old-age subsidies, one hears only a modicum of
complaint from taxpayers. It is easy to understand why. Not only would people
in the work force, regardless of class, prefer to be relieved of direct
financial responsibility for their parents, but also they themselves expect
someday to take advantage of Social Security, Medicare, special tax breaks,
reduced bus fares, and the like. For these reasons the majority of voters are
inclined to favor generous benefits to the old. But there may be a point at
which the young say "enough" and rise up in revolt against their elders.
Today's older generation need not worry; though the cost of their entitlements
is extraordinarily high, it is bearable, because it's spread across an
unusually large working-age population. The 75 million members of the Baby Boom
generation--all those Americans born between 1946 and 1964 have good reason to
fear desertion by their successors, however. Unless many fundamental trends are
soon reversed, the Baby Boomers are headed for a disastrous retirement.<p>

<p>

The long-term solvency of the Social Security system has come to depend on
several broad contingencies, none of which seems very likely in the lifetime of
the Baby Boom generation. Consider first how the system's pension, disability,
Medicare, and other trust accounts are financed. Since the late 1950s the
system as a whole has collected just about the same amount every year as it has
paid out. Because levels of revenue and expenditures vary from month to month
and are difficult to predict, each trust account maintains what might be called
a contingency reserve. Today these reserves are generally sufficient to cover
only a few months' worth of benefits.<p>

<p>

It has been widely predicted that over the next few decades the pension fund
will grow substantially. The convergence of two demographic trends helps to
explain why. First, the youngest members of the Baby Boom generation are just
now entering the work force and starting to pay taxes. Second, in the early
1990s the rate of increase in the system's annual pension costs will taper off,
owing to the relatively small size of the Depression-born cohort that will then
be reaching retirement age. Barring another recession, these trends, in
combination with a series of modest payroll-tax increases scheduled to go into
effect between now and 1990, mean that by the early l990s the pension-fund
account is likely to begin to take in much more than it pays out. And it should
continue to do so until the very large Baby Boom cohorts enter retirement.<p>

<p>

Some observers have suggested that a large reserve within the pension fund will
help the system meet the tremendous cost of the Baby Boom generation's
retirement. Unfortunately, for the same period in which the pension fund is
projected to be in surplus the Medicare trust fund is expected to incur a huge
deficit. If past experience is any guide, it is quite likely that Congress will
adopt the quick fix of inter-fund borrowing. Thus the reserves expected in the
pension-fund account will probably be used to replenish the Medicare fund, with
no means of repayment in sight.<p>

<p>

There is another, more fundamental reason why Baby Boomers should not look to a
surplus as a panacea. By law, a surplus accruing within any of Social
Security's various trust accounts must be used either to offset the deficits of
other trust accounts or to buy debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the
United States Treasury. Almost all such transactions amount to one part of the
government writing an IOU to another. Taxpayers are ultimately liable for both
the principal and the interest on these IOUs--that is, for replenishing Social
Security's accounts. Their ability to pay inevitably depends on the condition
of the economy when the IOUs come due. Thus, in order to be of any benefit to
future taxpayers, a surplus would have to be deployed in a way that made
taxpayers richer in the future than they would have been otherwise.
Unfortunately, although some portion of federal spending, such as that which
goes to education and scientific research and development, does serve to
improve future productivity, most goes solely to meet the wants of the here and
now, and will in no sense benefit generations to come.<p>

<p>

The outlook for Social Security cannot be determined by looking at the
operations of its various trust accounts in isolation. The architects of the
Social Security system realized as much. For example, in 1949 the economist
Eveline M. Burns, one of the prime theoreticians of the social-insurance
movement, addressed the matter of surpluses in her book The American Social
Security System:<p>

<p>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The economic burden on any society of maintaining a large number of
non-producers at some future date can be reduced in only one way: the present
generation must take action to increase the productivity of future generations
over what it would otherwise be....The income the retired aged will enjoy in
1980 or 2000 will reduce correspondingly the current income available to the
rest of the population living at that time. If the present generation wishes
those living in 2000 to be no worse off than themselves, in spite of having to
support a much larger proportion of non-producers, they must so add to or
improve the material and human capital of that society that productivity will
increase by the extent of the additional burden."<p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>

Social Security's future depends ultimately on the broad course of American
society, and many variables come into play. These include the rates of
mortality, disability, immigration, and emigration; the birth rate; the rates
of inflation in prices and wages; the unemployment rate; trends in work-force
participation, child-rearing practices, and retirement decisions. The numbers
one assigns to these variables can make the system's prospects look either rosy
or dire.<p>

<p>

Recognizing how indeterminate any projection of the system's long-term
financing must be, the Social Security Administration (SSA) issues four
projections, which range from "optimistic" to "pessimistic." Under the most
recent "II-B" intermediate forecast--the category that President Reagan's
National Commission on Social Security Reform adopted for planning
purposes--Medicare will slip into deficit in 1993 and its reserves will be
completely depleted by 1998; the disability fund will be "exhausted" by 2034
and the pension fund by 2050. (The pension fund, of course, could go broke
earlier if its reserves are used to cover deficits in the other two funds.)<p>

<p>

To reach these less-than-reassuring conclusions the SSA had to assume that
there will be no more recessions during the next seventy-five years, that the
economy will grow by two to three percent a year, and that after 1990
unemployment will not exceed six percent a year. The SSA also assumed that the
birthrate will rise by at least 11 percent by the year 2010 (a reversal of the
downward trend of the past two centuries) and that life expectancy at
sixty-five will increase by no more than three years and nine months.<p>

<p>

Even the SSA's most "pessimistic" model calls for the economy to perform better
in the future than it actually has during the recent past. This model is based
on the assumptions that inflation will not rise above 5.9 percent and that
after 1990 real wages will increase by an average of 1.3 percent a year. Yet
from 1973 to 1983 inflation averaged 8.2 percent and real wages actually
declined by an average of 0.9 percent a year. The worst-case model also assumes
that the unemployment rate will not exceed 8.6 percent and that after 1989
there will be no recessions.<p>

<p>

If the economy behaves according to this scenario, the SSA predicts, the
disability trust fund will be exhausted in three years, Medicare in seven, and
the pension fund by 2024. The SSA estimates that by 2055 the cost of these
three programs will be equivalent to 42 percent of all taxable payroll. The
present cost of the three programs is about 14 percent of all taxable
payroll.<p>

<p>

All SSA forecasts for the next century assume--with good reason--that future
pension benefits will be much less generous than today's. In amendments to the
Social Security Act passed in 1983 Congress enacted cutbacks that will lead to
sharp reductions in pensions during the period in which the Baby Boomers will
be retiring. As a result many (if not most) members of that generation will
probably pay more into the system than they collect.<p>

<p>

In a study published two years ago in the Cato Journal, Anthony Pellechio and
Gordon Goodfellow, of the Department of Health and Human Services, calculated
the financial consequences of the 1983 amendments, given the SSA's II-B
assumptions and constant 1983 dollars. Here are some of their specific findings
for Americans now under twenty-five: All members of this generation who remain
single over their lifetimes, except for women who earn no more than $10,000 a
year, will be net losers. A single man who earns $35,700 or more will lose some
$80,000 on his "investment" in Social Security. Two-paycheck families with
incomes higher than $20,000 will likewise pay more taxes than they receive in
benefits. (Such projected losses contrast sharply with the returns enjoyed by
current beneficiaries. In 1982 the Congressional Research Service estimated
that a sixty-five-year-old worker who filed for pension benefits that year and
who had contributed the maximum taxes since 1937 would get his contribution
back in only seventeen months.)<p>

<p>

The main reason why members of the Baby Boom generation should not expect much
from Social Security, even if the system does survive, has to do with the rules
for taxation of pensions. Since 1984 individuals whose income exceeds
$25,000--including all interest income and half the value of their
pensions--have had to pay federal income tax on the whole of their pensions.
Congress did not provide for the $25,000 threshold to rise with inflation, nor
is it likely to do so in the next century, when the financial pressures on the
system will be extreme. Given just the modest inflation rates assumed by the
SSA's II-B model, $25,000 will buy less in 2030 than $4,000 buys today. Thus
all but the poorest Baby Boomers will probably have to pay income tax on their
pensions.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>T</font></b>HE idea that Americans are bound by destiny to experience ever-greater
affluence has been an article of faith since the Second World War. That idea
helps to explain why until recently almost nobody considered that public
borrowing might encumber future generations. It seemed to follow that as long
as the economy continued to grow at a robust rate, the transfer of debt from
one generation to another would be painless. Borrowing against the future would
be like taxing the rich to help the poor.<p>

<p>

Paul A. Samuelson, arguably the most influential economist of the postwar era,
helped to popularize the notion of borrowing against the future in a defense of
Social Security that appeared in Newsweek in 1967. "The beauty about social
insurance is that it is ACTUARIALLY unsound," he wrote.<p>

<p>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Everyone who reaches retirement age is given benefit privileges that far
exceed anything he has paid....How is this possible? It stems from the fact
that the national product is growing at compound interest and can be expected
to do so for as far ahead as the eye cannot see. Always there are more youths
than old folk in a growing population. More important, with real incomes
growing at some 3 percent per year, the taxable base upon which benefits rest
in any period [is] much greater than the taxes paid historically by the
generation now retired....Social Security is squarely based on what has been
called the eighth wonder of the world--compound interest. A growing nation is
the greatest Ponzi game ever contrived. And that is a fact, not a paradox."<p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<p>

For any historian of the postwar era, one of the great riddles to be solved is
why a generation of economists and intellectuals who had experienced the trauma
of the Great Depression became convinced during the 1950s that the country had
entered an age of unbounded growth and affluence. David Riesman, a sociologist
at Harvard University, whose commentaries on the Zeitgeist of the 1950s
were--and still are--widely appreciated, was among the first to proclaim that
the near prospect of an end to scarcity had transformed American society. In an
essay published in 1952 Riesman wrote, "Whereas the explorers of the last
century moved to the frontiers of production and opened fisheries, mines and
mills, the explorers of this century seem to me increasingly to be moving into
the frontiers of consumption."<p>

<p>

In 1956 the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., called on liberals to put aside
their concern for economic growth and to address instead what he called
"miseries of an age of abundance." Schlesinger wrote in a much-remarked essay
for The Reporter, a leading liberal journal of the day, "Instead of talking as
if the necessities of living--a job, a square meal, a suit of clothes, and a
roof--were still at stake, we should be able to count that fight won and move
on to the more subtle and complicated problem of fighting for individual
dignity, identity, and fulfillment in a mass society." Schlesinger urged
liberals to occupy themselves with such goals as "the bettering of our mass
media and the elevation of our popular culture, in short, with the QUALITY of
civilization to which our nation aspires in an age of ever-increasing abundance
and leisure."<p>

<p>

The conviction that the economy would always grow and that the next generation
would have to be concerned only with matters of the spirit owes much to the
influence of the economist John Maynard Keynes. Even with the world economy
collapsing around him, in 1930 Keynes confidently predicted that through the
miracles of science and compound interest the standard of living in developed
countries would rise so high that the common man would be free to cultivate
"the art of life itself." In an essay titled "Economic Possibilities for Our
Grandchildren" he wrote that the new age would bring a reaffirmation of "the
most sure and certain principles of religion and traditional virtue--that
avarice is a vice, that the exaction of usury is a misdemeanor, and the love of
money is detestable, that those walk most truly in the paths of virtue and sane
wisdom who take least thought for the morrow."<p>

<p>

In the 1960s the discussion of the relationship between the economy and the
good of society narrowed. For years economists had been debating what the
"optimal" rates of savings and investment ought to be. In the 1960s a more
specific question arose: By how much should social planners discount the
interests of future generations in their cost-benefit analyses of such
long-term public investments as dams and highways?<p>

<p>

Economists argued endlessly over what they referred to as the "social discount
rate," wielding against one another such arcana as alternative utility
functions, mathematical axioms of cardinal welfare, and game-theory matrices.
The real subject of the debate, however, was not at all obscure. According to
the Yale University economist James Tobin, in a 1964 essay summarizing the
already voluminous literature, the real subject was one that "has always
intrigued and preoccupied economists: the present versus the future." Tobin put
the question this way: "How should society divide its resources between current
needs and pleasures and those of next year, next decade, next generation?"<p>

<p>

In the beginning the idea that it is reasonable for one generation to make
sacrifices for the welfare of the next went unchallenged. But as the economy's
robust growth continued, some doubt on that point was introduced. In 1964
Gordon Tullock, an economist now at George Mason University, asserted that "the
next generation...is going to be wealthier than we are," and that to save in
its behalf would "clearly tax the poor to help the rich." In 1968 William
Baumol, an economist at Princeton University, paraphrased Tullock's description
of public investments, calling them a "Robin Hood activity stood on its head."
Apparently convinced that future generations would enjoy ever greater
affluence, Baumol wrote, "In our economy, by and large, the future can be left
to take care of itself. There is no need to lower artificially the social rate
of discount in order to increase further the prospective wealth of future
generations."<p>

<p>

In examining the course of the debate over the social discount rate one is
struck by several ironies. The first is that precisely during the period in
which mainstream economists were moving to the view that their cohort was under
little or no obligation to undertake new capital projects in behalf of future
generations, much of the nation's existing infrastructure was being allowed to
fall into disrepair. Beginning in the late 1960s the cost of the Vietnam War
and the expanding agenda for social spending necessitated severe cutbacks in
spending for public works. From 1965 to 1980 total public capital investment
declined by 30 percent, from $33.7 billion to less than $24 billion. Measured
as a share of gross national product, the nation's capital budget fell by more
than half, according to estimates by the Council of State Planning Agencies.<p>

<p>

These statistics betray not only a reluctance at all levels of government to
undertake new projects but also a lack of commitment to the maintenance of
existing public works. According to separate studies by the Congressional
Budget Office and Congress's Joint Economic Committee, from 1983 to 2000 the
country will need to spend more than a trillion dollars to repair and replace
existing public infrastructure. This sum is equal to more than half of the
national debt and much of it must be counted as part of the encumbrance being
imposed on the young by the old. What economists should have been asking
themselves twenty years ago, it now seems clear, was not how much people should
sacrifice to build new dams, highways, bridges, and the like but whether they
were under any obligation to maintain the improvements that had been conveyed
to them by preceding generations.<p>

<p>

The second irony of the debate is that although subsidies to the elderly were
increasing dramatically throughout the 1960s and 1970s, that trend made no
evident impression on anyone's thinking about the reciprocal obligations
between generations. Even the philosopher John Rawls, of Harvard University,
who joined the discussion in 1971 with his monumental book A Theory of Justice,
made the implicit assumption that only one generation occupies the earth at any
given time, and that therefore the old are never repaid for the sacrifices they
have made for the young.<p>

<p>

F. Scott Fitzgerald, famously, defined a generation as that reaction against
fathers which occurs about three times a century. In discussions of political
economy, however, the more useful distinction is between dependent youths,
working-age adults, and the also dependent retired population. In the United
States today these three generations share the stage, and each, according to
law, has its own set of rights and privileges. Members of each generation begin
life entitled to public subsidy from their elders for the cost of education if
nothing else. They end life entitled to subsidy from their
juniors--specifically, for the full public cost of health-care and retirement
benefits.<p>

<p>

The long-term interdependence of the three generations makes questions of
reciprocity, and therefore of justice, inevitable. The middle generation in any
given era either must strike a prudent balance between the demands of its
parents and the demands of its children or prepare itself for an unhappy
retirement. If, for example, the government spends so much on the elderly that
it must skimp on the education of the young or on investment in economic
growth, then when it is time for the young to govern, they may be unable to
provide their elders with enough support. Alternatively, if the government is
stingy with the elderly, the young may come to feel like the child in "The Tale
of the Ungrateful Son"--free to shirk their responsibilities to the old.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=4><b>O</font></b>LD age is no longer synonymous with need. According to the U.S. Bureau of the
Census, as recently as 1959 nearly a third of the population over sixty-five
was living below the poverty line. According to the latest Census figures, the
number is now 14.1 percent--a full percentage point less than for the
population as a whole. Moreover, when the market value of non-cash benefits
like food stamps, Medicare, and subsidized housing is counted, the poverty rate
among the old falls to 3.3 percent. There are nearly four times as many
children under eighteen below the federal poverty line as there are senior
citizens below it. Indeed, by some measures, the elderly as a group actually
have a higher standard of living than the working-age population does. For
example, in 1982 the average after-tax per capita income for households headed
by people sixty-five and older was estimated by the Census bureau to be $7,845.
The average for all households headed by people under sixty-five was $6,780.<p>

<p>

Advertisers, predictably, have been quicker than social scientists to catch on
to the emergence of an increasingly large and prosperous class of older
Americans. Until recently it was a truism of the industry that companies with
"upscale" products to sell should generally avoid marketing to the elderly.
Indeed, consumers fifty and older, so the thinking went, were best ignored in
designing advertising strategies for most luxury items: people in that age
group were expected to be unhealthy, set in their ways, and reluctant to spend
what little discretionary income they might possess. Now that notion has
largely given way, in the face of the growing affluence and the new "active
life-style" enjoyed by many older Americans, including the retired.<p>

<p>

According to Judith Langer, a marketing-research consultant who published a
report for advertisers seeking to reach the over-fifty consumer, "The glitter
is off the Baby Boom." Langer says, "The Baby Boom was once the darling of the
media, but these people, it turns out, just don't have the disposable income of
older Americans."<p>

Rena Bartos, a senior vice-president of the advertising firm J. Walter
Thompson, has identified what she takes to be a new class within the population
of people fifty and older--one that she calls "active affluents." She says that
although most members of this class are still in their fifties and working, she
expects them to carry their "new values" and affluent life-styles with them
into retirement. "They're caught up in the same desire for self-realization
that affected the younger generation during the sixties and seventies," Bartos
says. "It's a desire not for total hedonism but for a full, rich life. They
don't want to just sit on the shelf. They want to travel, purchase luxury
items. Having fulfilled their obligation to educate their children, they don't
want to spend the rest of their days just building up an estate."<p>

<p>

The same theme is echoed in the promotional material sent to potential
advertisers by Modern Maturity, the official publication of the American
Association of Retired Persons. AARP is by far the largest and most powerful
senior-citizens' lobby in the country, claiming more than 18 million
dues-paying retired and "pre-retired" supporters. While its legislative office
has consistently pressed the argument on Capitol Hill that older Americans as a
whole need and deserve more social benefits, the business staff of its magazine
has been asserting the opposite to potential advertisers.<p>

<p>

One of the magazine's recent media kits proclaimed "50 &amp; Over people . . .
They've got clout! Affluent . . . Aware . . . Active Buyers with over $500
Billion to spend." Inside, the copy reads, "50 &amp; Over people are putting
into practice the credo of 'Living for Today'! They're spending on
self-fulfillment NOW (Hedonism vs. Puritanism), rather than leaving large sums
behind." AARP's advertising brochure boasts, "When viewed on a per capita
income basis . . . the 50 &amp; Over group reveals a high income profile and
spending pattern that makes it one of the most affluent consumer markets in the
U.S. today."<p>

<p>

The pitch has worked spectacularly. In 1983 Adweek for the first time included
Modern Maturity on its annual list of the country's ten "hottest" magazines.
During the previous recession years Modern Maturity's advertising revenue had
surged ahead by 46 percent, with a 21 percent gain in ad pages.<p>

<p>

Ironically, many firms have decided that the best way to reach this new
affluent class of older Americans is to offer senior-citizen discounts. Eastern
Airlines, for example, has a fare policy under which a customer sixty-five or
older can buy a year's worth of travel over all its routes for $1,299--hardly
the sort of discount likely to benefit old people who are truly in need, but a
good marketing strategy for winning over "super citizens," as some advertisers
now label the comfortably fixed elderly. Banks, having become aware of the
tremendous pool of savings controlled by older Americans, now routinely offer
such benefits as free checking and reduced fees for safe-deposit boxes to
customers sixty-five and older. Of course, such discounts must come at least
indirectly at the expense of younger customers.<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=4><b>W</font></b>ITHIN a family transfers of wealth between the generations are usually based
on need. A rich father is not likely to receive payments from his children
merely because he has reached his sixty-fifth birthday. In contrast, almost all
federal benefits to the elderly are distributed with no consideration of need.
Yet as the senior-citizens' movement constantly stresses, many retirees
continue to be active, healthy, creative, and useful until very advanced ages.
Moreover, as we have seen, many are affluent, as well. Why, then, should we
persist in subsidizing them as generously as we do? More than a tenth of all
Social Security spending goes to households with independent incomes totaling
$30,000 or more a year. Much of this independent income is in the form of
interest payments and capital gains. To demand across-the-board benefits merely
on the basis of age is in effect to advocate welfare for the rich.<p>

<p>

Americans have good reason to make such a demand, however. From the start
politicians have described Social Security programs as forms of insurance--a
conceit in no sense justified by the actual financial mechanisms underlying the
system. Naturally, the elderly have based their retirement strategies on the
assumption that the government would keep its promises to them, come what may.
It would not be right to change the rules of the game on those already
collecting or soon to collect benefits, however expensive it may be to keep
those rules in force.<p>

<p>

Many younger readers are likely to ask, Why should the burden of reform fall
only on us and our children? Why should the old escape the consequences of
their own shortsightedness as a generation? Whether or not one can see a moral
justification for preserving the older generation's entitlements, one should
consider a purely political reason for doing so. The power of the Gray Lobby is
overwhelming. No reform is possible unless today's senior citizens are largely
exempted from sacrifice.<p>

<p>

In any case, the challenge for members of the Baby Boom generation will be not
how to meet the demands of their parents but how to provide for their own
retirement without putting an impossible economic burden on their children. In
the 1960s economists called into question the need for one generation to
provide for the future well-being of its descendants. Today the more pertinent
question is how much one generation can rightfully borrow from its descendants
to subsidize its own consumption.<p>

<p>

There are no purely technical solutions to the enormous deficits looming
everywhere in the social accounts of the government. According to Albert M.
Wojnilower, a prominent economist and the managing director of The First Boston
Corporation, in New York City, "Our problem is not an unbalanced federal but an
unbalanced national budget. As a nation and as individuals, we are probably
committed to expend more in real resources than we will be able to
produce....It is comforting to talk about a bloodless and abstract budget,
rather than to face the terrifying ethical and societal issues that have made
the budget what it is."<p>

<p>

The deficits arise ultimately from demographic shifts that have thus far not
been accommodated by the major institutions of the welfare state. For example,
on the whole Baby Boomers started working and paying taxes much later in life
than did members of the previous generation. Eighty-five percent of those now
between the ages of thirty-four and thirty-eight graduated from high school, in
comparison with only 38 percent of their parents. The majority of Baby Boomers
have completed at least one year of college. Now, consider the economic
implications of this trend in conjunction with increasing life expectancy.<p>

<p>

A thirty-five-year-old man can expect to live another thirty-nine years. If he
remained in school until he was nineteen and if he retires at what is now the
most common age--sixty-two--he will spend nearly half his life free from labor.
Can such a person, in any real sense, pay his own way through life? To do so,
he must produce as much during just half his lifetime as he consumes in all of
it.<p>

<p>

This example hints at the dimensions of our fiscal predicament. If the typical
middle-class citizen winds up consuming more over his lifetime than he
contributes to the growth of the economy, where will the resources come from to
settle his account? The shortfall will inevitably be charged to members of the
next generation, and will reduce their standard of living.<p>

<p>

Some, no doubt, will advocate higher taxes for the rich as a solution. But such
taxes alone are unlikely to yield enough revenue to cover even the reduced
entitlements now promised to the Baby Boom generation for its old age. Neither
is it likely that the country will be able to cover the shortfall by further
borrowing. Already the size of the national debt is limiting our options as a
society. This year the interest alone is expected to consume 15 percent of the
federal budget. Given current interest rates, every dollar the government
borrows today will cost taxpayers approximately $24 in interest over the next
thirty years. Right now government borrowing is responsible in large measure
for the country's high interest rates and overpriced dollar; the strength of
the dollar, in turn, contributes to the huge deficit in our balance of trade.
Leaving aside whether we can borrow against future resources without hurting
the next generation, we cannot do so without hurting ourselves.<p>

<p>

The demographic shift most important to long-term deficits is the dramatic
decline in fertility rates for members of the Baby Boom generation. Much more
than any increase or decrease in longevity, fertility rates affect the eventual
age distribution of a population. In recent years the American fertility rate
has ticked up slightly, but it is still close to the record low, reached in
1976, of 65.8 live births per 1,000 women of childbearing age. The low
fertility rate guarantees that the median age of the American population will
rise dramatically in the years ahead--barring, of course, an enormous increase
in immigration. As the population ages, the demands on the budget will become
extreme.<p>

<p>

Today the number of people sixty-five and older is growing twice as fast as the
population as a whole; the number eighty-five and older is growing more than
five times faster. Still, the burden of supporting the old is manageable,
because there are now 3.4 workers to help support each retiree. By 2030,
however, that ratio is expected to fall to two to one.<p>

<p>

Some people have optimistically observed that the cost of supporting the Baby
Boom generation through retirement may be offset, at least in part, by a
decrease in expenditures for the young as they decline in numbers. But if
current spending patterns persist, we will be left nevertheless with a huge
gap. The most recent study on the subject to date, by Robert Clark, an
economist at North Carolina State University, was published in 1977. In 1975,
according to Clark's estimates, total per capita expenditures for the elderly,
at all levels of government, exceeded the amount spent for children seventeen
and under--including the total spent on public education--by more than three to
one.<p>

<p>

The imbalance in social spending for the young and for the old has an
additional implication worth pursuing. It means that a couple can expect little
relief from the expense of raising children, and may therefore choose not to
have any. That expense is very high. Thomas Espenshade, in a 1983 study for The
Urban Institute, a nonprofit center for the study of social policy, in
Washington, D.C., calculated that the typical middle-income family of four, in
which the wife works part-time, spends $82,400 (in 1981 dollars) to care for
each child until the age of eighteen. The figure rises to around $100,000 per
child when such a family sends the children to a four-year public university or
college.<p>

<p>

These figures reveal only part of the problem. From 1960 to 1982 the
labor-force participation rate for married women in the prime childbearing
years of twenty-five to thirty-four more than doubled, from 29 percent to 62
percent. Yet despite all this additional work on the part of young wives the
real after-tax household income for the age group declined by 2.3 percent. No
wonder, then, that the birthrate is so low. Young couples have reason to feel
that they cannot afford to raise a family. Even though two paychecks have now
become the norm among today's young couples, their standard of living is
actually lower than that enjoyed by their counterparts in the early 1960s--when
typically only the husband worked, and the wife stayed home to raise
children.<p>

<p>

So it is that while the Baby Boom generation's prospects for retirement hinge
on population growth, too few young couples feel able to have families. Today
the obligation of the middle generation to the old is almost fully socialized,
while the cost of raising the next generation falls, for the most part, to
individuals. If that cost were offset by more generous subsidies, the birthrate
would almost certainly rise and the trend toward a disproportionate number of
old people in the population as a whole would be reversed.<p>

<p>

The elderly, in laying plans for their retirement, bet that young Americans
today would be much richer than they have turned out to be, and also less
healthy and more inclined to raise large families. Those errors probably will
not--and should not--cost senior citizens their entitlements. But they do point
up the need for young Americans to be more prudent in devising their own
institutions for retirement. For Baby Boomers especially, the margin for error
is very small.<p>

<p>

The augmentation of capital is central to the implicit contract between
generations, and members of the Baby Boom generation will neglect that at their
peril. Throughout history it has been the practice in most cultures for people
to strive during their middle years to build up or hold on to some store of
value, such as land or gold, for the eventual purpose of providing their
children with a legacy. Their chances of being supported and respected in old
age are thus much improved.<p>

<p>

A British folktale, for example, tells of a poor old man who was mocked by his
sons, until a friend, hearing of his plight, lent him a bag of coins for a day.
The old man allowed his sons to discover him at the kitchen table counting what
they took to be his secret treasure, and thereafter they all treated him with
proper veneration until he died.<p>

<p>

In an agrarian economy, such as that which prevailed in colonial New England,
the old could often retain enormous power over their middle-aged children by
refusing until the last possible moment to convey title to their farmland.
"Better it is thy children should seek to thee, than that thou shouldst stand
to their courtesy," went the common advice to the aged. As the social historian
David Hackett Fischer, of Brandeis University, has observed, in colonial New
England "land was an instrument of generational politics--a way of preserving
both the power and the authority of the elderly." According to Fischer, "Sons
were bound to their fathers by ties of economic dependency; youth was the
hostage of age."<p>

<p>

With industrialization the balance of power between the generations shifted.
Factory workers could start young and achieve a tolerable standard of living
without first inheriting an estate. But by the same token, having gained this
freedom, most could not save enough out of their wages to provide for their own
turn at being old.<p>

<p>

Under the rules of the welfare state the remedy for this problem has been to
allow each generation to tax its children, through such programs as Social
Security and Medicare. Because these programs are not capitalized, it might
seem that the social contract between the generations has been fundamentally
altered: each generation appears simply to appropriate by law some share of the
next generation's wealth, without providing any compensation.<p>

<p>

Yet, as we have seen, the long-term solvency of these programs depends on
robust economic growth. Barring extraordinary good luck the only way any
generation can bring about such compounding prosperity for its children is to
build up capital and invest it wisely. In effect, then, the terms of the social
contract have remained the same. Each generation, in exchange for support in
old age, still must provide its children with a legacy. All that has changed is
that the necessary sacrifice falls not just to the individual but to the whole
of his generation.<p>

<p>

The Baby Boom generation's long-term interests will be served best by policies
that promote capital formation and productive investment. In the short term,
the implementation of such policies would oblige Baby Boomers to rediscover the
ethos of thrift. For one thing, financial capital by definition is deferred
consumption. For another, as an increasingly large share of the pool of savings
was channeled to productive uses, there would be less credit available for
consumer borrowing. Yet the sacrifice would have its rewards. Baby Boomers
would have at least the moral satisfaction of attempting to pay their own way
as a generation. And they would stand a good chance of bringing about a truly
affluent society for themselves and for their children.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=4><b>T</font></b>HERE are many ways to organize such an effort, and I do not mean to suggest
any one. Advocates of industrial policy, who seek greater government investment
in either high-tech or declining industries, may find attractive the idea of
purposefully building up large reserves within Social Security's pension fund
and investing the assets not in Treasury notes but productively, in publicly
selected industries. The fact that an entire generation's retirement benefits
would be linked to the success of the investments would serve as a powerful
political check against boondoggles or special-interest bailouts. But all of
the hazards of a large socialized economy would come into play.<p>

<p>

Alternatively, Social Security and Medicare might be replaced gradually by
increasingly generous provisions for individual retirement accounts, and at the
same time taxes on savings and capital gains might be abolished or cut back.
This approach should appeal to more-conservative members of the Baby Boom
generation. If this strategy were undertaken, however, it would be important to
make sure, through the mechanism of tax incentives, that the resulting pool of
capital was used for productive purposes, rather than merely to finance mergers
and takeovers.<p>

<p>

Whatever strategy is adopted, there must still be generous public provision for
the elderly poor. It does not take much political savvy to realize that an
entitlement program based on need runs a much greater risk of being killed or
inadequately funded than does one that distributes benefits to all classes. But
as we have seen, providing benefits to the old regardless of need is bound to
impose an intolerable burden on the young--principally because there will be so
many old people to support in the next century.<p>

<p>

Is there any way around this predicament? One means of compromise would be to
raise the retirement age higher than Congress has already done (it is scheduled
to be sixty-seven by 2027). At first glance this proposal seems fair. The Baby
Boom generation will probably be longer-lived than any that has gone
before--and thus will spend a longer period in retirement. But whereas means
testing presents a potential threat only to the poor, setting the age
requirement higher is all but certain to have unhappy consequences. The poor do
not live as long as middle- and upper-class people do. Black males born in
1982, for example, had a life expectancy that year of 64.9 years. In contrast,
white males born the same year could be expected to live past seventy-one.
Distributing benefits on the basis of age alone tends to work to the advantage
of those least in need. Raising the retirement age under such a system only
compounds the inequity.<p>

<p>

Giving to each according to his circumstances rather than his age seems the
fairest principle. Such a policy may encourage some people to be spendthrifts,
but if we provide a strong incentive to save for retirement, the problem should
be manageable. As currently written, the tax code rewards large borrowers, by
allowing full deductions of interest payments, and discourages most forms of
saving. Given the Baby Boom generation's long-term need for capital formation,
this is a perverse arrangement.<p>

<p>

What becomes of Social Security, Medicare, and other retirement programs in the
future is not an issue for senior citizens. It is an issue for their children
and grandchildren to decide, before time runs out.

		<h2>

		CANTO XXIII

		</h2>



[Dante is with Beatrice in the eighth circle,<br>

that of the fixed stars. She is gazing upwards,<br>

watching for the descent of the Triumph of Christ.]<p>



<p>



<p>



Even as a bird, 'mid the beloved leaves,<br>



    Quiet upon the nest of her sweet brood<br>



    Throughout the night, that hideth all things from us,

<p>



Who, that she may behold their longed-for looks<br>



    And find the nourishment wherewith to feed them,<br>



    In which, to her, grave labors grateful are,<p>



Anticipates the time on open spray<br>



    And with an ardent longing waits the sun,<br>



    Gazing intent, as soon as breaks the dawn:<p>



Even thus my Lady standing was, erect<br>



    And vigilant, turned round towards the zone<br>



    Underneath which the sun displays least haste;<p>



So that beholding her distraught and eager,<br>



    Such I became as he is, who desiring<br>



    For something yearns, and hoping is appeased.<p>



But brief the space from one When to the other;<br>



    From my awaiting, say I, to the seeing<br>



    The welkin grow resplendent more and more. <p>



And Beatrice exclaimed: "Behold the hosts<br>



    Of the triumphant Christ, and all the fruit<br>



    Harvested by the rolling of these spheres!"<p>



It seemed to me her face was all on flame;<br>



    And eyes she had so full of ecstasy<br>



    That I must needs pass on without describing.<p>



As when in nights serene of the full moon<br>



    Smiles Trivia among the nymphs eternal<br>



    Who paint the heaven through all its hollow cope,<p>



Saw I, above the myriads of lamps,<br>



    A sun that one and all of them enkindled,<br>



    E'en as our own does the supernal stars.<p>



And through the living light transparent shone<br>



    The lucent substance so intensely clear<br>



    Into my sight, that I could not sustain it.<p>



O Beatrice, my gentle guide and dear!<br>



    She said to me: "That which o'ermasters thee<br>



    A virtue is which no one can resist.<p>



There are the wisdom and omnipotence<br>



    That oped the thoroughfares 'twixt heaven and earth,<br>



    For which there erst had been so long a yearning."<p>



As fire from out a cloud itself discharges,<br>



    Dilating so it finds not room therein,<br>



    And down, against its nature, falls to earth,<p>



So did my mind, among those aliments<br>



    Becoming larger, issue from itself,<br>



    And what became of it cannot remember.<p>



"Open thine eyes, and look at what I am:<br>



    Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough<br>



    Hast thou become to tolerate my smile."<p>



I was as one who still retains the feeling<br>



    Of a forgotten dream, and who endeavors<br>



    In vain to bring it back into his mind, <p>



When I this invitation heard, deserving<br>

 

Of so much gratitude, it never fades<br>



    Out of the book that chronicles the past.<p>



It at this moment sounded all the tongues<br>



    That Polyhymnia and her sisters made<br>



    Most lubrical with their delicious milk,<p>



To aid me, to a thousandth of the truth<br>



    It would not reach, singing the holy smile,<br>



    And how the holy aspect it illumed.<p>



And therefore, representing Paradise,<br>



    The sacred poem must perforce leap over,<br>



    Even as a man who finds his way cut off.<p>



But whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme,<br>



    And of the mortal shoulder that sustains it,<br>



    Should blame it not, if under this it trembles.<p>



It is no passage for a little boat<br>



    This which goes cleaving the audacious prow,<br>



    Nor for a pilot who would spare himself.<p>



"Why does my face so much enamor thee,<br>



    That to the garden fair thou turnest not,<br>



    Which under the rays of Christ is blossoming?<p>



There is the rose in which the Word Divine<br>



    Became incarnate; there the lilies are<br>



    By whose perfume the good way was selected."<p>



Thus Beatrice; and I, who to her counsels<br>



    Was wholly ready, once again betook me<br>



    Unto the battle of the feeble brows.<p>



As in a sunbeam, that unbroken passes<br>



    Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of flowers<br>



    Mine eyes with shadow covered have beheld, <p>



So I beheld the multitudinous splendors<br>



    Refulgent from above with burning rays,<br>



    Beholding not the source of the effulgence.<p>



O thou benignant power that so imprint'st them!<br>



    Thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope<br>



    There to the eyes, that were not strong enough.<p>



The name of that fair flower I e'er invoke<br>



    Morning and evening utterly enthralled<br>



    My soul to gaze upon the greater fire.<p>



And when in both mine eyes depicted were<br>



    The glory and greatness of the living star<br>



    Which conquers there, and here below it conquered,<p>



Athwart the heavens descended a bright sheen<br>



    Formed in a circle like a coronal,<br>



    And cinctured it, and whirled itself about it.<p>



Whatever melody most sweetly soundeth<br>



    On earth, and to itself most draws the soul,<br>



    Would seem a cloud that, rent asunder, thunders,<p>



Compared unto the sounding of that lyre<br>



    Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful,<br>



    Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue.<p>



"I am Angelic Love, that circle round<br>



    The joy sublime which breathes from out the bosom<br>



That was the hostelry of our Desire;<p>



And I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while<br>



    Thou followest thy Son, and mak'st diviner<br>



    The sphere supreme, because thou enterest it."<p>



Thus did the circulated melody<br>



    Seal itself up; and all the other lights<br>



    Were making resonant the name of Mary.<p>



The regal mantle of the volumes all<br>



    Of that world, which most fervid is and living<br>



    With breath of God and with his works and ways,<p>



Extended over us its inner curve,<br>



    So very distant, that its outward show,<br>



    There where I was, not yet appeared to me.<p>



Therefore mine eyes did not possess the power<br>



    Of following the incoronated flame,<br>



    Which had ascended near to its own seed.<p>



And as a little child, that toward its mother<br>



    Extends its arms, when it the milk has taken,<br>



    Through impulse kindled into outward flame,<p>



Each of those gleams of white did upward stretch<br>



    So with its summit, that the deep affection<br>



    They had for Mary was revealed to me.<p>



Thereafter they remained there in my sight,<br>



    Regina coeli singing with such sweetness,<br>



    That ne'er from me has the delight departed.<p>



Oh, what exuberance is garnered up<br>



    In those resplendent coffers, which had been<br>



    For sowing here below good husbandmen!<p>



There they enjoy and live upon the treasure<br>



    Which was acquired while weeping in the exile<br>



    Of Babylon, wherein the gold was left.<p>



There triumpheth beneath the exalted Son<br>



    Of God and Mary, in his victory,<br>



    Both with the ancient council and the new,<p>



He who doth keep the keys of such a glory.<p>

Oft have I seen at some cathedral-door<br>



A laborer, pausing in the dust and heat,<br>



Lay down his burden, and with reverent feet<br>



Enter, and cross himself, and on the floor<br>



Kneel to repeat his pater-noster o'er;<br>



Far off the noises of the world retreat;<br>



The loud vociferations of the street<br>



Become an undistinguishable roar.<br>



So, as I enter here from day to day,<br>



And leave my burden at this minster-gate,<br>



Kneeling in prayer, and not ashamed to pray,<br>



The tumult of the time disconsolate<br>



To inarticulate murmurs dies away,<br>



While the eternal ages watch and wait.<p>

I enter, and I see thee in the gloom<br>	



    Of the long aisles, O poet saturnine!<br>



     And strive to make my steps keep pace with thine.<br>



     The air is filled with some unknown perfume;<br>



The congregation of the dead make room<br>



     For thee to pass; the votive tapers shine;<br>



     Like rooks that haunt Ravenna's groves of pine<br>



     The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb.<br>



From the confessionals I hear arise<br>



     Rehearsals of forgotten tragedies,<br>



     And lamentations from the crypts below;<br>



And then a voice celestial that begins<br>



     With the pathetic words, "Although your sins<br>



     As scarlet be," and ends with "as the snow."<p>

     And the great Rose upon its leaves displays<br>



Christ's Triumph, and the angelic roundelays,<br>



     With splendor upon splendor multiplied;<br>



     And Beatrice, again at Dante's side,<br>



     No more rebukes, but smiles her words of praise.<br>



And then the organ sounds, and unseen choirs<br>



     Sing the old Latin hymns of peace and love<br>



     And benedictions of the Holy Ghost;<br>



And the melodious bells among the spires<br>

     Birds build their nests; while canopied with leaves<br>



     Parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers,<br>



And the vast minster seems a cross of flowers!<br>



     But fiends and dragons from the gargoyled eaves<br>



     Watch the dead Christ between the living thieves,<br>



     And underneath the traitor Judas lowers!<br>



Ah! from what agonies of heart and brain,<br>



     What exultations trampling on despair,<br>



     What tenderness, what tears, what hate of wrong,<br>



What passionate outcry of a soul in pain,<br>

     This medieval miracle of song!<p>

	<font size=5>T</font>HOMAS Jefferson, then the American ambassador to France, was in Paris in 1789
when the Bastille was stormed and the French Revolution began. He wrote to
James Madison a few days later, saying that he would probably not be coming
home anytime soon: "This scene," Jefferson observed, "is too interesting to be
left at present." <p>
On a recent Bastille Day, I found myself entertaining similar sentiments during
a visit with Peter Hatch at Monticello, Jefferson's home in the Virginia
Piedmont. Hatch, Monticello's director of gardens and grounds, is the man who
more than any other is responsible for restoring the 2,000-acre plantation's
gardens and groves to a state resonant with Jefferson's intentions, as spelled

out in a copious body of drawings and agronomic observations. Jefferson was an

avid farmer and horticulturalist (that is perhaps all he would have been, he
claimed, were it not for what he obliquely called "the history of our times"),
but the grounds at <A HREF="http://www.monticello.org/index.html">Monticello</A> fell into ruin soon after his death, in 1826. A
little more than a century later, in 1939, after the estate passed from private
hands into those of a foundation, the Garden Club of Virginia undertook a

reconstruction of the oval flower beds that had surrounded the mansion and also
of the serpentine walkway that had defined the formal West Lawn. The club had
sketches to work from. Ingeniously, club members found the path of the walkway
by training automobile headlights on the terrain at night and marking the
shadowy depressions. In places the walkway could be traced because perennials
planted alongside it continued to grow. By all accounts the Garden Club did an
exemplary job with the flower beds and walkway, but a great deal remained to be
done.<p>



Peter Hatch arrived in 1977. He immediately started re-creating Jefferson's
ornamental forest, known as the Grove. Next, after an archaeological
investigation that began in 1979, came the rebuilding and replanting of the

1,000-foot-long vegetable garden, on a terrace above a massive retaining wall.

The following years saw the restoration of the South Orchard (1981); the
reconstruction of the elegant brick Garden Pavilion (1984); the replanting of
the Northeast Vineyard (1985); the creation of the Thomas Jefferson Center for
Historic Plants, a repository for rare seeds and heirloom flowers and
vegetables (1987); and the replanting of the Southwest Vineyard (1992). <p>

I was introduced to the work of Peter Hatch by a mutual friend, who sent me a
wonderfully learned and cheerfully quirky manuscript by Hatch titled
<a href="excerpt.htm">"Chainyballs, Tennis-ball Lettuce, and the Breast of Venus 
Peach."</a> Among other
things, I discovered from the manuscript that Jefferson's favorite vegetable
probably was peas, and that he cultivated seventeen kinds of them; that he grew

beans and corn from seeds brought back by Lewis and Clark; that he was
instrumental in popularizing the tomato in America, although the tomato he knew
was ribbed and lobed like a pumpkin or a buttercup squash; and that, in the

Grove, he assiduously maintained a collection of what one visitor mockingly
called "pet trees"--exotic specimens gathered from around the country and the
world. In addition, Hatch had this to say about Jefferson: <p>
<blockquote>His passion often outstripped his skill, and the saga of many horticultural
projects, from grape culture to sugar-maple plantations, began with dreamy
visions that dissolved before the harsh realities of the Virginia climate and
an unruly plantation structure. </blockquote> <p>
Jefferson was also at all times deeply in debt, and though he employed a great
many overseers in the course of a lifetime, he never had one who earned his
confidence. <p>

 <font size=5>P</font>ETER Hatch is a youthful-looking man of forty-seven who dresses in a way
appropriate to physical activity outdoors. When I met him, on a day in July
when the temperature exceeded 100&#176;, he wore gray shorts and a gray sport
shirt and strong brown walking shoes. He has lived in the South for almost
three decades, and its soft tones lightly coat his speech, leaving no hint of

</table>his native Michigan. I got the impression after talking with him for just a few
minutes that although he likes book learning and scholars well enough, he
prefers having his hands a little dirty and spending his time with his workers.
(He has a full-time staff of about twelve people.) He is naturally athletic,
and I noted that on his r&eacute;sum&eacute; under "Awards" he lists not only
such things as the 1984 "Merit Award, American Society of Landscape Architects"
and the 1989 "Productivity Trophy, Vinifera Wine Growers Association" but also
"All-Metro High School Ice Hockey, Detroit News, 1967." Hatch's failure, after
his graduation from the University of North Carolina, to land a job as an
ice-hockey coach and English teacher at a private school outside Boston led by

chance to a joyous summer with friends on an organic farm on Cape Cod. His life
deflected toward horticulture, he returned to North Carolina for training and
before long was hired to be the first horticulturalist at the Old Salem
restoration, in Winston-Salem. Monticello hired him three years later. <p>
Hatch's greenhouses and his office lie just out of sight of Jefferson's mansion
and about a hundred feet below it, on the eastern slope of Monticello mountain.
Not far from his door a dirt track gives entry to the forest. Hatch pointed to
it and said, "Let's take the second roundabout." The trees closed above us.<p>

Jefferson encircled his 867-foot-high mountain at four elevations with level
tracks the width of a carriage. The first roundabout is at the summit, and
girds the house and lawns and gardens. The fourth roundabout is halfway down
the mountain. The roundabouts are connected one to another by sloping tracks
that Jefferson called "one-in-tens" and "one-in-twenties," referring to the
steepness of the grade. We followed a counterclockwise course along the second

roundabout, Hatch offering intermittent commentary. He stopped at an ironwood
tree to admire its silvery fluted trunk, its striking combination of delicacy
and strength. We came across a lone magnolia in a thick forest of chestnut and
hickory, an upland setting unusual for magnolias. "It's probably a descendant
of one Jefferson planted around the house," Hatch explained. Non-native species
that propagate in new environments are said to have "escaped." Jefferson's
collection of non-native plants was vast, and as a result flora on the lam can
today be found all over his mountain. Seeing these plants, I thought of John
Adams's last words: "Jefferson still survives."<p>

Along the roundabout a little farther on, the forest lightened considerably: we
had come to the lower Grove, where the thick underbrush has been removed and
the trees have been thinned and pruned to a height of twenty or thirty feet, so

as to stand like columns under a high canopy on an undulating grassy hillside.
Jefferson had admired the achievement of similar effects during a tour of
English country houses in 1786. In England stands of trees typically had to be
added to a landscape of rolling fields to produce the desired environment. In

Virginia the strategy was just the opposite. As Jefferson explained, "We have
only to cut out the superabundant plants." At one point Jefferson talked about
obtaining a buck elk for the Grove to serve as "monarch of the wood."
(Apparently he never did.) Hatch led the way through the Grove from the second
to the first roundabout, turning at the summit's rim to take in the gently
shaded slope we had just climbed, and to recall a line from Jefferson: "Under
the constant, beaming, almost vertical sun of Virginia, shade is our
Elysium."<p>

Continuing on, still counterclockwise, we edged by the upper Grove and its
reassembled riot of pet trees--chinaberries and magnolias, dogwoods and
catalpas--and then moved on to the long vegetable garden on the terrace. Thick
rows of Jefferson's ribbed tomatoes--represented by the species <i>Costoluto
genovese</i>--were well on the way to ripeness. Extreme heat had been preceded
by weeks of rain, and rot was afflicting some of the other fruits and
vegetables. Looking at the damage, Hatch mentioned that Jefferson had been
maddeningly optimistic in the face of agricultural calamity. "He once lost his
whole wheat crop," Hatch said, "but that was okay, because it gave him a chance
to study the life cycle of the pest that destroyed it--the Hessian fruit fly.
He had a phrase about the failure of one thing being repaired by the success of
another." From the bottom of the terrace's retaining wall the vineyards and
orchards stretch downward into the distance. Jefferson was a skilled surveyor,
and left plans for his fields, but frequently that is not enough. One might
know the location of an orchard, but where were the individual trees?
Archaeology has sometimes been of help: for example, excavations revealed the
precise locations of scores of the original orchard trees, in the form of
circular stains left in the red-clay soil by the decomposed trunks. <p>

Hatch found us a cool place in the shade near the Garden Pavilion and described
the tribulations involved in trying to stock the landscape with the exact

species of plants that Jefferson knew. Sometimes Jefferson offhandedly referred
to a plant variety not by its real name but by the name of the person it came
from: "Leitch's pea." Well, what pea was Mr. Leitch growing? Even if Jefferson
used a real botanical name, the name may have changed over the years. We happen
to know that what he called the "black plumb peach of Georgia" was later called
the Cherokee peach and is today called the Indian Red or blood cling peach--so
Hatch knows what to plant. But the identities of Jefferson's "blue-speckled
snap" bean and "long haricot" bean remain a matter of guesswork. Another
problem: some once-valued species have over the years gone out of cultivation
and acquired the status of weeds. Hatch has spent hours driving through the
countryside, trolling for missing specimens sprouting along the road. Rare
seeds or cuttings, finally located, sometimes prove to be a disappointment.
Hatch spent years trying to obtain scionwood from Europe for the
Breast-of-Venus peach--one of Jefferson's favorites (he called it the "teat
peach") among the thirty-eight varieties of peach he grew--and thought he had
succeeded, only to discover when the trees finally bore fruit that the peaches
weren't Breast-of-Venus after all.<p> <pre>

</pre>
<font size=5>B</font>ACK in his office I looked around for a few minutes while Hatch returned some
telephone calls. A kitchen table displayed a colorful assortment of fresh
fruits and vegetables; the garden's produce is distributed among staff and
volunteers. In a photograph nearby I picked out Hatch's face from a group of
players in nineteenth-century baseball uniforms. He is on a team that plays by
the old rules and with the old equipment (or, as in the case of baseball
gloves, without equipment). A corner table held slides of grapes and grapevines
for a monograph being readied for publication.<p>
When he was free, I asked Hatch to define what he was and wasn't trying to
accomplish at Monticello. One thing Monticello isn't, he said, is a living


historical farm, like the ones to be found at, say, Old Sturbridge Village and
Plimoth Plantation, in Massachusetts. His staff doesn't dress in period
clothing or employ period tools or eschew fertilizer and pesticides. As Hatch
observed, "Other people are doing that sort of thing very well." Monticello,
rather, is an attempt at landscape restoration--"to provide a vignette of what

existed, the pulse of a historic landscape." Are there limits to what can be
shown? he went on to ask. Of course there are. Gardens and trees grow up, are
always changing. We don't know how carefully the landscape was maintained--for
example, how thickly weeds were allowed to grow. Moreover, Hatch has often made
good on Jefferson's schemes where Jefferson himself did not--for example, in
the growing of European grapes for wine in an uncongenial climate. (Hatch
succeeded by grafting European vines onto the established roots of hardy
American vines.) He pulled down an edition of the <i>Garden Book</i>,
Jefferson's richly detailed record of his plans and plantings and harvests, and
opened it to a typical page. There Jefferson listed one experimental endeavor
after another, following up after each with a report from a later date:
"Failed." "Failed." "Failed." "Failed." <p>

Several big projects lie ahead at Monticello, including the gradual
reintroduction of the "clumps" of trees at the corners of the mansion and the
creation of a scenic parkway down to the main county road. Hatch also has
administrative chores and lectures to attend to. And he is completing a book.
But the biggest challenge he faces, Hatch says, is simply meeting the
plantation's daily demands. "I strive toward managing the landscape and
restoring the gardens and reviving old plants more diligently than any other
facet of my job. These are things that I will never completely finish to my
highest expectations." <p>

Thomas Jefferson might have delivered the same self-assessment. But he would
have come closer to what he intended with the help of Peter Hatch.

<H3>An excerpt from "Chainyballs, Tennis-Ball Lettuce,<br> and
the Breast of Venus Peach: Searching for the Plants<br> of Thomas Jefferson," by
Peter Hatch</h3>

<blockquote>
</center>
<p><pre>

</pre>
<font size=4>
Thomas Jefferson's interest in horticulture extended far beyond the casual
efforts of a Virginia gentleman tastefully decorating his table and estate. The
geographic  origins of the plants grown at Monticello attest to the reach of
his gardening imagination -- from the Mandan corn and Arikara bean discovered
by Lewis and Clark, to the thirty-five varieties of <i>vinifera</i>, or
European grape, grown in the experimental vineyard; from the upland rice
Jefferson smuggled home from France, to exotic flowering trees recently
introduced from China, such as the mimosa, golden rain tree, and yes, the
chinaberry. When Jefferson wrote that "the greatest service which can be
rendered any country is to add a useful plant to its culture,"  he assumed the
role of an aggressive plantsman, and Monticello became an experimental station
of new and unusual introductions from around the world. Probably no early
American gardener wrote about his garden as much as Jefferson. His Garden Book
is a remarkable document, detailing a lifetime of sowing cabbages, harvesting
peas, and manuring asparagus, sketching dreamy visions of romantic grottoes,
and concisely recording the culture of 250 vegetable and 170 fruit varieties.
Thomas Jefferson was crazy about gardening.<p>

	When Jefferson referred to his "garden," he, like most early American
gardeners, was referring to his kitchen or vegetable garden. The [Thomas
Jefferson Memorial] Foundation committed itself to the restoration of the
eight-acre garden and orchard in 1979, and to complement the ample
documentation of the site provided by Jefferson's records, an archaeological
crew was employed to trace original fence lines, uncover the garden's
monumental retaining wall, and look for other details that would enable the
restoration to begin. A remarkable discovery was the exact location of
fifty-eight of the original orchard trees, discernible by the dark stains in
Monticello's red clay soil, the planting pattern nearly identical to one drawn
by Jefferson in 1778.  The use of archaeology in the landscape raises new
challenges and dilemmas for the gardener. A restoration of the orchard demanded
not only replanting in the precise, newly unveiled locations, but the retrieval
of the specific variety of fruit Jefferson himself planted.<p>

	The identification of Jefferson's original planting holes, like the remarkable
revelation of the Elizabethan garden at Bacon's Castle, in eastern Virginia,
provides a clear-cut image of an earlier landscape. Archaeology, however, is a
slow and expensive process. At least at Monticello, archaeological findings
often raise more questions than answers as they relate to documentary evidence.
The identification and even the dating of tree-hole stains is hardly a precise
science.  New techniques for the archaeological identification of plant
species, such as pollen analysis and phytolithic investigation, are inexact
when attempting to describe whether a plant is a weed or was cultivated.  While
these techniques can often specify the genus of a plant, its species more often
remains a mystery. Also, the process of archaeology, involving the removal of
vast quantities of soil, can obliterate living botanical evidence, such as
seeds, bulbs, even the roots of extant historical material.<p>

	The essence of the gardening process involves the deep cultivation of the
soil. Horticulturists are taught to dig a fifty-dollar hole for a five-dollar
tree. Plow scars, the root growth of trees, and planting holes can obliterate
the subtle archaeological evidence in the ground.  At Monticello it is a battle
for sacred land that often results in a stalemate. On four different occasions,
in 1790, 1791, 1804, and 1807, Jefferson noted the planting of "clumps of trees
in the four "corners" or "angles" of the house. The clumps, composed of fifteen
to twenty shade and ornamental trees, were an arrangement Jefferson had admired
in England during his landscape tour in 1787, while the corners or angles were
specific areas immediately around the house.  It seemed that Jefferson hoped
not only to embower his house in trees, but also to create miniature gardens of
nearly all the botanical elements -- trees, flowers, shrubs -- in an area most
Virginians reserved for the swept yard. Although we know the species of trees
that were planted, and can assume the boundaries of the "corners" with some
certainty, the actual placement of each tree remains a mystery.
Archaeologically stripping the entire area is not realistic or economically
feasible. A re-creation based on a subjective interpretation would perhaps
destroy the stains of the original plantings. The clumps were a clear
reflection of Jefferson's landscape design sensibility, but until technological
advances produce some super X-ray machine that will decipher completely the
past disturbances of man and nature, the architectural face of Monticello will
remain unembowered.<p>

	The years of archaeological excavations and the unceasing reliance on
documentation are important at Monticello, for like many historic sites, much
of the original landscape has disappeared.  Following  Jefferson's death,
souvenir hunters robbed the estate of specimen shrubs, the Grove was reputedly
leveled to create a silkworm plantation of mulberry trees,   and the West Lawn
was plowed in order to plant corn. The Levy family, regularly praised for their
efforts in preserving the house from 1836 to 1923, might, understandably, have
been unaware of the need to stabilize terraces, preserve old walkways, and
protect naturalized flower bulbs.  The contours of a mountain are easily
disturbed and eroded. Even the Civilian Conservation Corps, working at
Monticello during the Depression, has been accused of robbing the vegetable
garden's retaining wall in order to construct a modern paved road. Often, when
dealing with the landscape, the terms restoration and "tidying up" are
synonymous. Wild shrubberies of escaped plants, awkward terraces, and crumbling
weed-ridden stone walls are easy targets for aggressive maintenance personnel.
The near-removal of the Monticello larch tree, the "old dead pine," is a useful
example of this kind of misguided zeal.<p>

		 </font>ne of the most stuck-up guys I ever met is the 
piano virtuoso Franz Liszt. When I mention this, people always say, "But 
he's dead!" Try telling <I>him </I> that. I just finished a nine-week, 
twenty-nine-city book tour with the guy, and yes, he is old--he may 
even be "dead" (whatever that means)--but he is definitely one big 
pain. And when I say I was on a book tour, I flatter myself. It was 
supposed to be a tour to promote my most recent work of fiction, 
<I>Buh </I>. Well, instead it became one of these new "piggyback" tours 
that publishers are so crazy about these days, where they send an author 
along with an established performing artist, a surefire crowd-getter like 
the popular Herr Liszt. Don't look at me--I just do what they tell me: 
sit at a table in the concert-hall lobby, sign books, read a short 
selection during intermission (<I>What </I> intermission? The guy never 
comes up for air!), introduce myself to the culture-page editors waiting 
to interview him, get myself known. The Liszt crowd is a reading crowd, I 
was told.<P>
I first met him in the sitting room of his suite in the Brown Palace 
Hotel, in Denver. Technically, of course, it was <I>our </I>suite, since 
my (smaller) bedroom and bath were part of it; but any space I shared with 
him immediately became his, and I see no reason to pretend otherwise now. 
He was smoking a complicatedly carved briar pipe and reading a copy of 
<I>What's Doing in Downtown Denver </I> supplied 
by the hotel. He hopped up on his long, wavery legs, introduced himself, 
and warmly took my hand. His fingers, which play tenths as easily as most 
concert pianists play octaves, twined around my wrist. I'd read in the 
publicity how "his sea-green eyes shone with rapid flashes like waves in 
flames," but that effect got by me somehow. Mainly what I was wondering 
was how he achieved that Gyro Gearloose flyaway look with his side hair. I 
went to my room to unpack, and when I returned, ten minutes later, the 
place was mobbed. Liszt fans were perched on the telephone table, the 
cabinet with the complimentary snack bar, and the window sills as he 
launched into a story about the time Edvard Grieg killed a spider with a 
piano stool--a recitation I was, unfortunately, to learn by heart. 
Bare-shouldered ladies sitting at his feet vied to rest their heads on his knees.<P>


<img src="Liszt.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

Talk about <I>party </I>! When does he ever sleep? I stood around on the 
fringes and tried to make conversation, but I was pretty beat from my 
flight. As I headed off to bed, he was ordering up baskets of champagne. I pulled 
a pair of those foam-rubbery hotel pillows around my ears to drown out the 
noise, and eventually I drifted off. The next I knew, I was wide awake to 
the sound of his uproarious laughter. I hunted for the digital clock by the bed--they never put those things where you can see them 
lying down--and discovered it was four-fifteen. Now he was humming 
loudly and contrapuntally, if that's possible, to merry applause from the 
entourage. Somehow I got back to sleep. At five of six I heard a knock on 
my door. There he stood, fully dressed in old-time formal clothes and a 
velvet cape. He wanted me to check the little button doohickeys behind the 
knee on his knickers or knee breeches or whatever they were, to see if 
he'd got them buttoned right. I mean, <I>enough </I> already!<P>
I'm not even going to discuss our first "event," it was such a nightmare. 
I held the fort at my table in the lobby and sold exactly two books, both 
of them to other writers who asked if they could send me manuscripts, as his SRO horde 
of screaming admirers strewed rose petals everywhere (the pink ones stain, 
by the way). I kept promising myself a big drink for later, and by the end 
of the evening it had grown to the size of a drink on a Hollywood 
billboard. I escaped at the first opportunity; after that the picture 
mercifully blurs.<P>
<P>
<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/L-small.gif" align=left height=44 
	alt="L">
     </font>iszt hadn't played in public since 1886, so naturally a lot of anticipation had built up. We sat together on the flight to Salt Lake City; when we got off
the plane, there were about 200 panting Liszt-omanes waiting for him, and 
Art Knapp, from the Bookworm's mall store, waiting for me. If Art hadn't been holding up a copy of my book, I'd never 
have spotted him in the melee. (I can pick out that 
awful cover--why my agent didn't get us cover 
approval I'll never know--at 500 yards.) I hadn't checked any bags, so 
I just left Liszt to his fate and let Art lead me to his car. He asked how 
my tour was going so far, and I lied and said great. Then he asked who was 
that old fellow everyone was clamoring for. I wanted to grab him right 
there on the moving walkway and give him a kiss. Turned out he had never 
heard of him! Thank God there's still some sanity left in the land. But I 
hid my feelings and explained politely about the world-renowned 
nineteenth-century pianist and blah blah blah, as if I were an expert on 
the subject myself.<P>
Later it got back to me that Liszt was really upset that I had run out on 
him at the airport. What was I supposed to do, trail along and hand out 
the smelling salts?<P>
I couldn't help it. He just rubbed me wrong, constantly. Little things he did got on my nerves--the way he always said 
"<I>bitte </I>" after every question, for example. "Would you hold my 
garment case for a moment, <I>bitte </I>?" "I cannot fit this under my 
seat, so may I place it under yours, <I>bitte </I>?" I had to <I>bitte </I> 
my tongue not to tell him what he could do with his <I>bitte </I>. And 
those damn cookbooks he carried everyplace he went. He used to read 
recipes out loud to me and then ask, "Ahhh--doesn't that sound good?" 
And he ate Pez candies, the kind in the little dispenser. He was always 
popping one into his mouth. He has an amazing sweet tooth. What makes it 
worse is that he never puts on any weight! Any sweets I eat always go 
straight to my hips. But old Liszt is one of those skinny, hyper musician 
types we'd all secretly love to be. And I don't have to tell you how those 
guys do with women. Fantastic is how they do. <P>
I mention this partly because of the chocolatier. In some airport or other 
Liszt met an attractive young chocolatier named Felice. We had stopped in 
a candy shop on the concourse to buy him his customary in-flight snack of 
two pounds of chocolate truffles. Felice, who waited on us, fell 
instantly, madly in love with him, closed up shop, bought a ticket, hopped 
on our flight, and was with us from then on. It happened that fast. Liszt 
was mad for her, too. And of course Felice absolutely hated me. 
<I>Hated </I> me. I think a lot of the problem had to do with the word 
"chocolatier." I just could never pronounce it to her satisfaction--in 
an introduction, for example. I realize it's a perfectly okay word, it's 
just not one I've had much occasion to use or am very comfortable with. 
Probably it bugged her that I always added "(French)" after it, to help 
people unfamiliar with its foreign 
origins.<P>
Liszt and Felice immediately got themselves his-and-hers matching 
everything. They pored over airline shopping catalogues and ordered 
expensive pen-and-pencil sets, executive stress-reducers, and pocket 
Breathalyzers, always by twos. In Dallas they bought identical luggage, 
which shouldn't have irritated me, but did. I came to dread seeing my own 
suitcase with the broken side zipper gaping forlornly amid their gleaming 
equipage on the baggage carousel. They always used porters--I prefer 
to carry mine--and they made out in taxicabs. Felice often recorded 
their conversations on a small tape recorder, which I noticed she turned 
off whenever I had something to say. Privately each told me how amazing 
and wonderful the other was. Of course all I could do was agree like an 
idiot.<P>
I think Felice would have preferred that I disappear; many times I felt as 
if I already had. In the green room of the Spokane Civic Theater she 
absentmindedly handed me a stack of manila envelopes meant for the UPS 
man--I looked just like him, she blithely explained. I could have 
taken the hint and gone for a walk around the block for about two weeks, 
but I chose to remain emphatically where I was. This was my tour too. To 
pass the time I paced and cleared my throat a lot and popped my knuckles, 
even though I knew how nuts that drove her. I sat reading my own book, 
occasionally chuckling at the good parts. Liszt remained oblivious of the 
daggers Felice now looked at me whenever I was in the vicinity. He thought 
she and I would be fast friends, coming from the same century and all. 
Mutual misunderstanding, already serious, deepened further.<P>

<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/A-small.gif" align=left height=44 
	alt="A">
     </font>t last I decided to get our conflicts out into the open. We were in the back of an airport limo, just the three of us, stuck 
in a traffic jam in Boise, Idaho, at seven o'clock in the morning. I 
looked out at the small creek of rainwater in the gutter, moving along 
faster than we were, and clarity seized me. "You know the real difference 
between you and me, Franz?" I asked. He turned to me with the smallest 
acceptable amount of polite interest on his seamed, subtle face, but I 
continued. "I am quirky. That is my essence--quirk. By that I mean I'm 
just <I>me </I>, a self that is completely my own <I>sui generis </I> 
individual kind of personality. I have my own take on things, which is 
always slightly skewed and edgy. This is reflected in my writing, which is 
quirky, skewed, et cetera, as well."<P>
I could see he had no idea what I was talking about. Felice, pretending to 
yawn and stretch, cuffed me on the side of the head.<P>
"That's <I>me </I>; whereas <I>you </I>," I went on, heedless, "you invented 
the symphonic poem, made the piano the equivalent of an entire orchestra, 
played for more people than any musician in history, donated vast sums to 
charity, composed masterpieces of tonal experimentation far ahead of their 
time--but, no offense, you're not quirky. I am much quirkier than you. 
You do have your own take on things, I admit, but it is skewed only 
slightly if at all, nowhere near as skewed as mine. And as for edgy, I am 
sorry to have to tell you this, but you are not edgy in the least. 
Brilliant? Yes. Edgy? No way. In fact, it's remarkable we've gotten along 
as well as we have."<P>
His sea-green eyes remained fixed on me in a look of complete bafflement. 
Later I found out that he had misheard me to say that I was "corky," and 
"corkier" than he was. Even if he'd heard me right, he wouldn't have 
understood. He came from a time when people actually had to know how to do 
stuff, or else they sat around all day burning peat or something, and 
there wasn't much call for high-end authors like me. I gave up trying to 
explain. But, oddly, Liszt didn't let the moment pass. He continued 
looking at me. Then he reached over, took my arm, and in that accent of 
his said, "Well, I'm sure you're a good egg!"<P>
Felice brought out her cell phone and pulled up the antenna and began 
calling vanilla suppliers. The traffic eased, the rain stopped, airport 
billboards appeared up ahead. Liszt rolled down the window and idly ran 
through some fingerings on his knee. I sat back in an unexpected rush of 
contentment. No, I'm being coy--ecstasy would be more like it, quiet 
ecstasy. Franz Liszt called <I>me</I> a good egg! And here I had never 
said even one nice thing about his piano playing. I'm nearly tone-deaf, to 
begin with, and my idea of good music is weepy early-eighties 
rock-and-roll that <I>nobody </I> likes nowadays, by bands with geographic 
place-names. What a perfect blurb for my next book: "'A good 
egg'--Franz Liszt." I still can't get over it. Felice finished her 
phone call and stowed her phone, and our glances met. The absence of a 
sneer on her beet-red lips could almost have been called a smile.<P>


<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/S-small.gif" align=left height=44 
	alt="S">
     </font>o I guess I have to take back some of what I've said. True, Liszt is a 
crazed egomaniac who believes that all the world is secondary to his 
towering genius. And true, he does sometimes trample the rights of others 
in the Preferred Customer lines, so you nearly get into fights. All the 
same, he's not a hundred percent bad. Old "Fist Full of Keys" Franz knows 
a lot more than he lets on. I mean, let's put ourselves in his position: 
he's been "dead" in a technical sense for more than a hundred years, and 
none of his friends are around anymore. He gets lonely. Of course he 
retreats into his celebrity and his music. Wouldn't you? Yet with all the 
sadness he has to keep bottled up, he still considers the other fellow's 
feelings--mine, for example. Soon after our exchange in the airport 
limo he invited me to sit in with him at a recording session at the 
studios of Deutsche Grammophon. Yes, that's me playing the triangle in the 
new version of <I>Danse Macabre </I>--you can just barely hear it. He 
wrote the part especially for me, and I was thrilled. We even jammed a 
little--after the tapes had stopped rolling, of course. He didn't have 
to do that, and I appreciated it. <P>
As for my book, it ended up selling pretty well, especially to people in 
the business. To my (pleasant) surprise, the publisher turned out to be 
right about the tour. Much as it graveled me always to be "the guy with 
Liszt," the backup interview, or the "In Brief" item or sidebar piece, I 
did get a decent amount of coverage out of the deal. Interviewers seemed 
to like it when I said that if I weren't a writer, I'd probably be either 
dead or in jail. I don't know why, but they always quoted that line, 
leaving out that it isn't really true. I personally know a lot of people 
who bought the book, sometimes more than one copy, and obviously there are 
many others I don't know about, which would increase the figure. I just 
received a royalty statement on the sales, but I won't go into a whole 
long analysis of it now. I'll merely mention that line seventeen of the 
statement, identified as "Line Fifteen Minus Line Sixteen," shows an 
amount over $7,000. That is either what I owe the publisher or what the 
publisher owes me--quite a respectable number for a work of fiction, 
in any event.<P>
Franz Liszt's place in history is already secure, and he will go on to 
make it even better. This time when he's reached his goals there won't be 
anyone who can touch him, ever. He and Felice just bought a place in 
Encino, and they divide their time between there and his native Hungary. 
He has a new tour planned, with race-car driver turned author Mario 
Andretti, which will be far bigger than the one I was on. They're looking 
at new venues on the NASCAR summer circuit, which would be way, way beyond 
my league but not beyond Liszt's, and more power to him. Having seen him 
myself in concert, I can promise that he owns the three essentials for any 
performer: he makes you laugh, he makes you cry, and he scares the hell 
out of you. No audience could ask for more. In Berlin back in 1841 people 
went so wild for him that they threw themselves under the wheels of his 
carriage--a trifle, I predict, compared with what's going to happen 
here. Despite everything that went down between him and me in the past, 
I'll be rooting for him all the way.<p>

<blockquote>


 <font size=5>M</font>ANY have tried to get at the heart of what makes Madagascar so different from
every other place in the world. "May I announce to you that Madagascar is the
naturalist's promised land?" the Frenchman Philibert de Commerson wrote in
1771. "Nature seems to have retreated there into a private sanctuary, where she
could work on different models from any she has used elsewhere." David
Attenborough, who brought his first images of the island to the outside world
in the early 1960s, described "a place where antique outmoded forms of life
that have long since disappeared from the rest of the world still survive in
isolation." To me, the most evocative metaphor comes from Alison Jolly, the
doyenne of lemur studies. In her discerning book <i>A World Like Our Own</i>
(1980), Jolly says that on Madagascar it is as if "time had once broken its
banks and flowed to the present down a different channel." <p>

<A HREF="relarmad.htm"><img src="../../../images/shorsera.gif" align=left vspace=10 hspace=10 border=0 alt="(Related Articles)">
	
	</A>

Down that channel has come a cornucopia of "weird and wonderful things," as a
scientist acquaintance put it to me recently. For monkey enthusiasts there are
<A HREF="http://www.cable.com/madagas/MAD_LEM.HTM">lemurs,</A> the spry, wide-eyed relatives of monkeys. Birders can dull pencils
making lists of vangas--birds that rival Darwin's finches for diversity--and of
four other families unique to the island. I happen to be partial to the
reptiles. Madagascar has more than half the world's chameleons, with their
independently swiveling eyes and body-length tongues. And it is the only home
of the leaf-tailed gecko, which looks like lichen until disturbed, when it
opens a blood-red mouth and screams like a banshee. <p>

Madagascar has landscapes as fanciful as anything conceived by <A HREF="http://www.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/wm/paint/auth/rousseau/">Henri Rousseau,</A>
from tropical rain forest to a bizarre "spiny desert" that is unique to the
island. Even the people are not what you'd expect. Though the island lies off
Mozambique, its people hail originally from Indonesia. At times, while passing
Malagasy, as the people of Madagascar are called, on the streets of the
capital, Antananarivo, you'd swear you were in Jakarta. Spiced with African,
Arabian, and French influences, the Malagasy culture is like no other.<p>

Despite its enticements, Madagascar remains off the beaten track, as if the
Mozambique Channel, which has isolated the island from Africa for more than 100
million years, had succeeded in keeping away tourists as well. For Madagascar
not only is far from where tourists tend to live but also, though boundlessly
rich in nature, is one of the world's poorest nations. This has implications
for the things that tourists use. You can count Madagascar's topflight hotels
on two hands. Making a telephone call to a number within the country would tax
the patience of Mother Teresa (though satellite links ease overseas calls). And
then there are the roads. In many areas even the national highways seem more
like motocross tracks. The roads are inescapable evidence of the fall in the
country's fortunes during the seventeen-year socialist era. This ended in 1992
with a democratic presidential election; both the country's name, the Republic
of Madagascar, and its leader, President Albert Zafy, are new since then.<p>

But if you plan your route well and roll with the punches that are inevitable
in a nation with an annual per capita income of less than $250, you can
experience a singular and still very foreign land. And you can stay in fine
hotels at very low rates. The exchange rate has lately been highly favorable to
American tourists: between my first visit, in 1993, and my second, last March,
the Malagasy franc went from 1,900 to 4,000 to the dollar. (The currency's
recent behavior has been erratic; at this writing its value is 4,600 to the
dollar.) <p>

My more recent trip began at Toliara, a port town on the southwest coast. I
joined a group of four other Americans to drive halfway up the island (end to
end the island is as long as the distance from New York to Orlando). Our
destination was Antananarivo, known simply as Tana, and we planned to spend a
day each in three of the country's top nature reserves along the way. One
biologist has called Madagascar's thirty-odd reserves a "necklace of pearls"; I
think of them as islands in a sea of degradation. Most of the forests that once
blanketed Madagascar have been cleared for farming and grazing, and the
continuing fast growth of the population, which now stands at 14 million,
threatens the rest (Alison Jolly calls it a "tragedy without villains"). If you
visit the island's nature reserves, you may be glad to know that your money is
helping to protect what the <A HREF="http://www.envirolink.org/orgs/wqed/wwf/wwf_home.html">World Wildlife Fund</A> considers to be the world's No.
1 biodiversity hot spot: the park fees you pay are split between the
protected-areas authority and local communities.<p>

We were met in Toliara by Bruno, our trim, typically Indonesian-looking guide.
Bruno is a member of the Merina, a tribe whose name means "those from the
highlands." The Merina have dominated the seventeen other tribes in Madagascar
ever since Merina kings unified the country in the eighteenth century and made
Tana their capital. <p>

Accompanying Bruno were two drivers, Jocelin and Parson, who commanded the two
four-wheel-drive vehicles that would be our transport for the next week. Unlike
Bruno, they spoke no English. (Forget about trying to get by in Madagascar with
just English at your disposal. Hire a guide who speaks Malagasy, because even
French, which is the language of commerce, is rarely spoken outside the
cities.) Our bags were piled on top of one car. The roof of the other bore
supplies,  including two large jerry cans containing water and diesel fuel. In
Madagascar there is no such thing as AAA. Between towns you're on your own.<p>

Route Nationale 7 out of Toliara gave no hint of what was coming. It was paved
three years ago by the French, who still provide a significant amount of aid to
what was their colony until 1960. But as soon as Parson, who bore a striking
resemblance to James Caan, turned his Toyota Land Cruiser onto Route Nationale
10, we got a good, hard feel for how bad Malagasy roads can be. In places the
highway resembled a covered-wagon trail in the Old West, with deep ruts dug by
cattle carts, still the principal means of transport in rural areas. "Piece of
cake," Parson said, using his only English phrase, each time he stomped on the
brakes to negotiate a particularly rugged patch of sun-hardened mud. 
<p>
<pre>
</pre>

 <font size=5>O</font>UR first stop was Beza-Mahafaly, a lemur reserve. Lemurs come from the same
evolutionary stock as we do, and they are arguably the country's biggest draw.
Once found worldwide, lemurs, an early model of primate, could not compete with
more highly evolved monkeys and apes, and where they had to try, they went
extinct. Left alone on Madagascar, lemurs have evolved into more than fifty
species and subspecies. (About fifteen other species, some as big as apes, have
gone extinct since human beings first set foot on the island, less than 2,000
years ago.) <p>

Because Beza is primarily a research reserve, the few thatched sleeping huts
there were set aside for scientists. So we pitched our tents on packed earth
beneath oaklike tamarind trees. That evening the drivers, who doubled as cooks,
laid out a feast of zebu steak (zebu being a kind of Asiatic ox), rice, leek
salad, and sliced pineapple; Bruno did his part by making a tasty White
Russian-like cocktail. (If camping is not your thing, Berenty, a private
reserve in the southeast that protects a similar coterie of wildlife and
habitats, has spacious twin-bedded bungalows with private showers for $64 a
night.)<p>

The next morning, after a breakfast of bread, guava jam, bananas, and strong
Malagasy coffee, we went in search of lemurs. Our guide was a fiftyish local
man named Manzagasy, who wore a red Marlboro hat and red shorts. The trails
were overgrown--a sign of how few tourists make it this far south (Beza had
only 130 last year). Overhead arched the wide-spreading tamarinds, which
provide lemurs with food and lodging--and provide lemur-seekers like us with
welcome shade. <p>

After half an hour Manzagasy suddenly put his finger to his lips and pointed.
It was hard to see through the dense foliage, but a sudden thrashing of leaves
directed us to a pale blob on a high branch. It was a Verreaux's sifaka.
Sifakas are a type of lemur that was named for its alarm call
("she- <i>fahk</i>!"); the Verreaux's is an exceptionally beautiful one. It has
snow-white fur, a round black face, and a tail as long as its body. We watched
as a band of five or six sifakas leaped fifteen-foot gaps in the canopy. When
we were ready, Manzagasy moved on. The forest was hot and quiet. Now and then
he stopped to point out a nocturnal sportive lemur staring down with amber eyes
from its tree-trunk nest. We had hoped to find ringtails, the most gregarious
of lemurs; just as we were about to give up on them, we came upon a group right
on the trail. As curious about us as we were about them, they let us approach
until we were only steps away. With their black-and-white-striped tails and
masked faces, they might have been dressed to perform in a circus.<p>

Even though it was the end of the six-month rainy season, it was dry. Because
midday temperatures topped 100 degrees in the shade, however, we waited until late
afternoon to walk in Beza's spiny desert, which harbors trees that rival Van
Gogh's cypresses for expressiveness. We marveled at the comically bulbous
baobabs, known as "upside-down trees" for the branches that splay like roots
from their crowns, and at the cactuslike octopus trees, whose vertical branches
poke at the sky like fingers. Other plants in the desert have gone to great
evolutionary lengths to arm themselves against attack. Some sport thorns
reminiscent of sharpened pencils; others ooze a milky latex that, if it gets in
the eyes, can cause blindness. But we took care and were rewarded with a softly
lit landscape straight out of a fairy tale. <p>

At precisely 8:00 A.M. the next day--Bruno was a man for strict timetables--we
drove back to Route Nationale 7 and bore east. We were headed for our second
destination, Isalo National Park, the site of Madagascar's answer to the Grand
Canyon. Long before we reached Isalo, we could see part of the massif after
which the park is named: a wall of Jurassic sandstone rising from the plain
like battlements. After an hour clambering around La Fen&ecirc;tre, a natural
rock window affording a panoramic view west over the plain we had just crossed,
we drove a few minutes farther on to the three-star Relais de la Reine, our
hotel for the next two nights. <p>

Built three years ago by the French entrepreneur Gilbert Colombier, the hotel
would, I think, have pleased Frank Lloyd Wright. It blended into the landscape
so well that I didn't see it until we pulled up in front. The rooms ($64 per
person for a double, with meals) are decorated in a tastefully rustic style,
with furniture and beams carved from local wood. After eight dusty hours on the
road and a night sleeping on the ground, we were ready for the plush beds and
the large private bathrooms.<p>

That evening, after meeting in the bar over bottles of Three Horses, the
national beer, we followed a white-jacketed waiter into the high-ceilinged
dining room, which looked out onto sunlit canyon walls. Monsieur Colombier
changes his menu each night. The first night I dined on onion soup, kidneys in
mustard sauce, and apple tart, washing the meal down with domestic Betsileo
wine; the second night I enjoyed a succulent roast zebu in mushroom sauce, with
pommes frites and vegetable quiche, and a dessert of mocha cake.<p>

Like Beza, Isalo has an arid climate, but there the similarities end. The local
people are Bara, Madagascar's most African-looking tribe and reputedly its
fiercest warriors. Isalo has plant species found only there, such as the
peculiar elephant's foot, which looks like a gourd with arms. Most distinctive
is the landscape. Its wildly eroded bluffs and hidden valleys cry out for
exploration. Of Isalo, Lonely Planet's thorough guidebook says, "If you have
time for only one wilderness foray in Madagascar, this should be it." The Irish
writer Dervla Murphy concurs in her wry travel book <i>Muddling Through in
Madagascar</i>, calling Isalo "an hallucinatory place."<p>

Like America's great canyons, Isalo needs several days--or weeks--to be seen
properly. We had only a day, and carried a picnic lunch into the high-walled
Canyon des Singes ("Canyon of the Monkeys"), probably named for its resident
white sifakas. With five or six days you could trek roundtrip through rarely
trod canyons to the Grotte des Portugais, a deep cavern with signs of ancient
habitation. Some historians hold that Portuguese sailors who were shipwrecked
on the west coast in 1527 sheltered in the cave. But local Bara legend has it
that the occupants were the Vazimba, an aboriginal people who are believed to
have inhabited the island long before the Malagasy arrived in their outrigger
canoes.<p>
<pre>
</pre>

<font size = 5>B</font>RUNO had us up early the next day, for the long drive to the third reserve on
our itinerary, the rain-forest park of Ranomafana. After several hours of
driving across a high, treeless plain, we dropped down to Ihosy, the capital of
the Baras. Malagasy place-names often have wonderful pronunciations, like
something out of Dr. Seuss. Ihosy ("<i>ee </i>-oosh") was a lovely little market
town. Tall, handsome Bara men in straw homburgs and brightly colored lambas
drifted wraithlike through the streets. Low-hanging clouds and a strange quiet
lent an otherworldly atmosphere. I would have liked to pause longer in Ihosy,
but after provisioning ourselves for a picnic lunch, we drove on. <p>

We had planned to camp in the rain forest that night, but soon after we entered
Ranomafana, the road overruled that idea. In the dark and drizzle we passed a
sign bearing a red skull and crossbones and the warning DANGER DE MORT! Just
ahead a landslide had taken out a big chunk of the road. "Not a piece of cake,"
Parson said, looking despairingly into the gap. Fortunately, not only had a
private coach already been sent from Tana to take us the rest of the way but,
because our route involved a bit of backtracking, the coach was on our side of
the slide. It was late, and the nearest good hotel was two hours back down the
road, so the group decided to sleep across the coach's seats. The best news was
that the remainder of the route was paved.<p>

The next morning, after clambering across the washed-out hillside, we crossed a
bamboo bridge over the rain-swollen Namorona River and hiked up a steep trail
into the forest. Some of Madagascar's thousand-odd species of orchids clung to
trees rising through the canopy like Jack's beanstalk. On the ground, mosses
and ferns sparkling with tiny droplets festooned fallen logs. While my
companions scanned the canopy for lemurs, I kept my focus lower down, searching
for some of the park's lesser-known residents: chameleons, with their eerie
eyes; bright-green day geckos; and the freakish giraffe-necked weevil. Alas, I
had to settle for a single frog that we found in a stream. <p>

The day was overcast and humid, and we were soon winded and sweaty. But we did
not have long to wait before Claude, the teenage guide we had hired to show us
Ranomafana, tracked down four of the reserve's twelve lemur species, including
a handsome black cousin of the sifakas we had seen at Beza. As at Isalo, we had
only a day at Ranomafana, which is almost three times the size of Acadia
National Park and has much to offer the curious. With enough time, you could
hire one of the park's many English-speaking guides and try your luck at
finding some of the rain forest's more rarely seen mammals, such as the golden
bamboo lemur and the fossa (pronounced <i>foosh</i>). Like a cross between a
mongoose and a mountain lion, the fossa fills the niche left unclaimed by
Africa's lions and other large predators, which evolved too late to set foot on
Madagascar.<p>

On the final leg to Tana we stopped for souvenirs in the wood-carving center of
Ambositra and in Antsirabe, known for gems. Tana itself, draped over a dozen
hills at an invigorating altitude of 4,200 feet, is an enchanting place. Its
drawbacks--crime after dark, cars without catalytic converters, traffic
jams--are more than made up for by the inherent good nature of the Malagasy and
the anachronistic, almost medieval quality of the city. <p>

The sights can be seen in a day. In the morning you could visit some of the
city's impressive churches and pick up souvenirs and a feel for Malagasy life
in the Zoma ("Friday") market--a misnomer in that this raucous daily street
fair in the center of town is held daily. In the afternoon you could take a
taxi to the Tsimbazaza zoo. A good compendium of what there is to see in the
reserves, the zoo showcases aye-ayes--the most bizarre of lemurs, made famous
in Gerald Durrell's book <i>The Aye-aye and I</i>--and a wide selection of
other creatures. There you can also see skeletons of some of Madagascar's
long-extinct species, including the pygmy hippo and the flightless elephant
bird, the largest bird that ever lived. My favorite sight was the city itself,
with its narrow, hilly streets between the French-style brick houses of the
Merina, who make up the bulk of the population of close to two million. With
their red-tiled roofs and carved wooden balconies, the houses lend an Old World
charm to this very Third World city. <p>

By mid-afternoon we were ensconced in Tana's comfortable H&ocirc;tel Colbert.
Located in the heart of Haute-Ville ("Upper Town"), the Colbert offers
carpeted, air-conditioned rooms with TV, full bath, and a good view for rates
that start at about $100 a night. The Colbert's La Taverne restaurant is a
favorite eating spot among Tana's well-to-do. The night I was there it appeared
to be filled with expatriate French businessmen. Specialties include tripe in
apple-brandy sauce and frog's legs, though I can vouch only for the zebu steak,
which was delicious. The Colbert also has a casino, a p&acirc;tisserie, and
several high-priced gift shops.<p>

Package tours to Madagascar from the United States are scarce, but a growing
number of companies in Great Britain offer trips (see the 
<A HREF="http://www.lonelyplanet.com.au/lp.htm">Lonely Planet</a> guide
<i>Madagascar and Comoros  </i>for details). For customized travel, the
California-based company Cortez Travel (800-854-1029), which ran the trip I was
on, comes highly recommended by Lonely Planet and by Alison Jolly. A third
approach: through my employer, <A HREF="http://gaia.earthwatch.org">Earthwatch</A> (800-776-0188), researchers welcome
paying volunteers to help them study lemur behavior at two sites on the island.
<p>

Whatever means you choose, if you are intrigued, go soon, because <A HREF="http://www.cable.com/madagas/madagas.htm">Madagascar</A> is
on the verge of being discovered. Who knows? By the time you get there, the
road from Toliara may be paved all the way to Tana.

<p>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
<i>Philadelphia, January 3, 1793</i><p>

<p>

DEAR SIR,-- My last private letter to you was of Oct. 16. since which I have
received your No. 103, 107, 108, 109, 11O, 112, 113 &amp; 114 and yesterday
your private one of Sep. 15, came to hand. The tone of your letters had for some
time given me pain, on account of the extreme warmth with which they censured
the proceedings of the Jacobins of France. I considered that sect as the same
with the Republican patriots, &amp; the Feuillants as
the Monarchical patriots, well known in the early part of the 

revolution, &amp; but little distant in their views, both having in

object the establishment of a free constitution, &amp; differing 

only on the question whether their chief Executive should be

hereditary or not. The Jacobins (as since called) yielded to the

Feuillants &amp; tried the experiment of retaining their hereditary

Executive. The experiment failed completely, and would have

brought on the reestablishment of despotism had it been pursued.

The Jacobins saw this, and that the expunging that officer

was of absolute necessity. And the Nation was with them

in opinion, for however they might have been formerly for

the constitution framed by the first assembly, they were come 

over from their hope in it, and were now generally Jacobins.

In the struggle which was necessary, many guilty persons fell 

without the forms of trial, and with them some innocent.

These I deplore as much as any body, &amp; shall deplore some
of them to the day of my death. But I deplore them as I

should have done had they fallen in battle. It was necessary

to use the arm of the people, a machine not quite so blind as

balls and bombs, but blind to a certain degree. A few of their

cordial friends met at their hands the fate of enemies. But

time and truth will rescue &amp; embalm their memories, while

their posterity will be enjoying that very liberty for which

they would never have hesitated to offer up their lives.

The liberty of the whole earth was depending on the issue of

the contest, and was ever such a prize won with so little innocent

blood? My own affections have been deeply wounded

by some of the martyrs to this cause, but rather than it should

have failed, I would have seen half the earth desolated. Were

there but an Adam &amp; an Eve left in every country, &amp; left free,

it would be better than as it now is. I have expressed to you

my sentiments, because they are really those of 99. in an

hundred of our citizens. The universal feasts, and rejoicings 

which have lately been had on account of the successes of the

French showed the genuine effusions of their hearts. You have

been wounded by the sufferings of your friends, and have by this circumstance
 been hurried into a temper of mind which would be extremely
disrelished if known to your countrymen. The <i>reserve of the President of the
United States</i> had never permitted me to discover the light in which he viewed
it, and as I was more anxious that you should satisfy him than me, I had still
avoided explanations with you on the subject. But your 113. induced him to
break silence and to notice the extreme acrimony of your expressions. He
 added that he had been informed the sentiments you expressed <i>in your
  conversations</i>
were equally offensive to our allies, &amp; that you should consider yourself
as the representative of your country and that what you say might be imputed to
your constituents. He desired me therefore to write to you on this subject. He
added that he considered <i>France as the sheet anchor of this country and its
friendship as a first object</i>. There are in the U.S. some characters of opposite
principles; some of them are high in office, others possessing great wealth,
and all of them hostile to France and fondly looking to England as the staff of
their hope. These I named to you on a former occasion. Their prospects have
certainly not brightened. Excepting them, this country is entirely republican,
friends to the constitution, anxious to preserve it and to have it administered
according to it's own republican principles. The little party above mentioned
have espoused it only as a stepping stone to monarchy, and have endeavored to
approximate it to that in it's administration in order to render it's final
transition more easy. The successes of republicanism in France have given the
coup de grace to their prospects, and I hope to their projects. -- I have
developed to you faithfully the sentiments of your country, that you may govern
yourself accordingly. I know your republicanism to be pure, and that it is no
decay of that which has embittered you against it's votaries in France, but too
great a sensibility at the partial evil which it's object has been accomplished
there. I have written to you in the stile to which I have been always
accustomed with you, and which perhaps it is time I should lay aside. But while
old men are sensible enough of their own advance in years, they do not
sufficiently recollect it in those whom they have seen young. In writing too
the last private letter which will probably be written under present
circumstances in contemplating that your correspondence will shortly be turned
over to I know not whom, but certainly to some one not in the habit of
considering your interests with the same fostering anxieties I do, I have
presented things without reserve, satisfied you will ascribe what I have said
to it's true motive, use it for your own best interest, and in that fulfil
completely what I had in view.<p>

	With respect to the subject of your letter of Sep. 15. you will be sensible
that many considerations would prevent my undertaking the reformation of a
system with which I am so soon to take leave. It is but common decency to leave
to my successor the moulding of his own business. -- Not knowing how otherwise
to convey this letter to you with certainty, I shall appeal to the friendship
and honour of the Spanish commissioners here, to give it the protection of
their cover, as a letter of private nature altogether. We have no remarkable

<br>
<blockquote>
<br>

<i>Paris, November 13, 1787</i><p>

<font size=5>D</font>EAR SIR, -- I am now to acknoledge the receipt of your favors of October the
4th, 8th, &amp; 26th. In the last you apologise for your letters of
introduction to Americans coming here. It is so far from needing apology on
your part, that it calls for thanks on mine. I endeavor to show civilities to
all the Americans who come here, &amp; will give me opportunities of doing it:
and it is a matter of comfort to know from a good quarter what they are, &amp;
how far I may go in my attentions to them. Can you send me Woodmason's bills
for the two copying presses for the M. de la Fayette, &amp; the M. de
Chastellux? The latter makes one article in a considerable account, of old
standing, and which I cannot present for want of this article. -- I do not know
whether it is to yourself or Mr. Adams I am to give my thanks for the copy of
the new constitution. I beg leave through you to place them where due. It will
be yet three weeks before I shall receive them from America. There are very
good articles in it: &amp; very bad. I do not know which preponderate. What we
have lately read in the history of Holland, in the chapter on the Stadtholder,
would have sufficed to set me against a chief magistrate eligible for a long
duration, if I had ever been disposed towards one: &amp; what we have always
read of the elections of Polish kings should have forever excluded the idea of
one continuable for life. Wonderful is the effect of impudent &amp; persevering
lying. The British ministry have so long hired their gazetteers to repeat and
model into every form lies about our being in anarchy, that the world has at
length believed them, the English nation has believed them, the ministers
themselves have come to believe them, &amp; what is more wonderful, we have
believed them ourselves. Yet where does this anarchy exist? Where did it ever
exist, except in the single instance of Massachusetts? And can history produce
an instance of rebellion so honourably conducted? I say nothing of it's
motives. They were founded in ignorance, not wickedness. God forbid we should
ever be 20 years without such a rebellion. The people cannot be all, &amp;
always well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented in
proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain
quiet under such misconceptions it is a lethargy, the forerunner of death to
the public liberty. We have had 13. states independent 11. years. There has
been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a century &amp; a half for
each state. What country before ever existed a century &amp; a half without a
rebellion? &amp; what country can preserve it's liberties if their rulers are
not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of
resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts,
pardon &amp;  pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two?
The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of
patriots &amp; tyrants. It is it's natural manure. Our Convention has been too
much impressed by the insurrection of Massachusetts: and in the spur of the
moment they are setting up a kite to keep the hen-yard in order. I hope in God
this article will be rectified before the new constitution is accepted. -- You
ask me if any thing transpires here on the subject of S. America? Not a word. I
know that there are combustible materials there, and that they wait the torch
only. But this country probably will join the extinguishers. -- The want of
facts worth communicating to you has occasioned me to give a little loose to
dissertation. We must be contented to amuse, when we cannot inform.<p>

<h2>An Excerpt of Query XIV <br> from the <br><i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i> (1781)<p>

<font size=4>by  Thomas Jefferson</font></h2>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>

<p>

<font size=5>I</font>t will probably be

	asked, Why not retain and incorporate the blacks into the

	state, and thus save the expence of supplying, by importation

	of white settlers, the vacancies they will leave? Deep rooted

	prejudices entertained by the whites; ten thousand recollections, 

by the blacks, of the injuries they have sustained; new

	provocations; the real distinctions which nature has made; 

	and many other circumstances, will divide us into parties, and

	produce convulsions which will probably never end but in the

	extermination of the one or the other race. -- To these objections, which are
political, may be added others, which are

	physical and moral. The first difference which strikes us is that

	of colour. Whether the black of the negro resides in the reticular membrane

 between the skin and scarf-skin, or in the 

	scarf-skin itself; whether it proceeds from the colour of the

	blood, the colour of the bile, or from that of some other secretion, the
difference is fixed in nature, and is as real as if its

	seat and cause were better known to us. And is this difference

	of no importance? Is it not the foundation of a greater or less

	share of beauty in the two races? Are not the fine mixtures of

	red and white, the expressions of every passion by greater or

	less suffusions of colour in the one, preferable to that eternal

	monotony, which reigns in the countenances, that immoveable veil of black
which covers all the emotions of the other race? Add to these, flowing hair, a
more elegant symmetry of form, their own judgment in favour of the whites,
declared by their preference of them, as uniformly as is the preference of the
Oranootan for the black women over those of his own species. The circumstance
of superior beauty, is thought worthy attention in the propagation of our
horses, dogs, and other domestic animals; why not in that of man? Besides those
of colour, figure, and hair, there are other physical distinctions proving a
difference of race. They have less hair on the face and body. They secrete less
by the kidnies, and more by the glands of the skin, which gives them a very
strong and disagreeable odour. This greater degree of transpiration renders
them more tolerant of heat, and less so of cold, than the whites. Perhaps too a
difference of structure in the pulmonary apparatus, which a late ingenious
experimentalist has discovered to be the principal regulator of animal heat,
may have disabled them from extricating, in the act of inspiration, so
much of that fluid from the outer air, or obliged them in expiration, to part
with more of it. They seem to require less sleep. A black, after hard labour
through the day, will be induced by the slightest amusements to sit up till
midnight, or later, though knowing he must be out with the first dawn of the
morning. They are at least as brave, and more adventuresome. But this may
perhaps proceed from a want of forethought, which prevents their seeing a
danger till it be present. When present, they do not go through it with more
coolness or steadiness than the whites. They are more ardent after their
female: but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender
delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation. Their griefs are transient. Those
numberless afflictions, which render it doubtful whether heaven has given life
to us in mercy or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them. In
general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation than
reflection. To this must be ascribed their disposition to sleep when abstracted
from their diversions, and unemployed in labour. An animal whose body is at
rest, and who does not reflect, must be disposed to sleep of course. Comparing
them by their faculties of memory, reason, and imagination, it appears to me,
that in memory they are equal to the whites; in reason much inferior, as think
one could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the
investigations of Euclid; and that in imagination they are dull, tasteless, and
anomalous. It would be unfair to follow them to Africa for this investigation.
We will consider them here, on the same stage with the whites, and where the
facts are not apocryphal on which a judgment is to be formed. It will be right
to make great allowances for the difference of condition, of education, of
conversation, of the sphere in which they move. Many millions of them have been
brought to, and born in America. Most of them indeed have been confined to
tillage, to their own homes, and their own society: yet many have been so
situated, that they might have availed themselves of the conversation of their
masters; many have been brought up to the handicraft arts, and from that
circumstance have always been associated with the whites. Some have been
liberally educated, and all have lived in countries where the arts and sciences
are cultivated to a considerable degree, and have had before their eyes samples
of the best works from abroad. The Indians, with no advantages of this kind,
will often carve figures on their pipes not destitute of design and merit. They
will crayon out an animal, a plant, or a country, so as to prove the existence
of a germ in their minds which only wants cultivation. They astonish you with
strokes of the most sublime oratory; such as prove their reason and sentiment
strong, their imagination glowing and elevated. But never yet could I find that
a black had uttered a thought above the level of plain narration; never see
even an elementary trait, of painting or sculpture. In music they are more
generally gifted than the whites with accurate ears for tune and time, and they
have been found capable of imagining a small catch. Whether they will be equal
to the composition of a more extensive run of melody, or of complicated
harmony, is yet to be proved. Misery is often the parent of the most affecting
touches in poetry. -- Among the blacks is misery enough, God knows, but no
poetry. Love is the peculiar r&oe;strum of the poet. Their love is ardent, but it
kindles the senses only, not the imagination. Religion indeed has produced a
Phyllis Whately; but it could not produce a poet. The compositions published
under her name are below the dignity of criticism. The heroes of the Dunciad
are to her, as Hercules to the author of that poem. Ignatius Sancho has
approached nearer to merit in composition; yet his letters do more honour to
the heart than the head. They breathe the purest effusions of friendship and
general philanthropy, and shew how great a degree of the latter may be
compounded with strong religious zeal. He is often happy in the turn ot his
compliments, and his stile is easy and familiar, except when he affects a
Shandean fabrication of words. But his imagination is wild and extravagant,
escapes incessantly from every restraint of reason and taste, and, in the
course of its vagaries, leaves a tract of thought as incoherent and eccentric,
as is the course of a meteor through the sky. His subjects should often have
led him to a process of sober reasoning: yet we find him always substituting
sentiment for demonstration. Upon the whole, though we admit him to the first
place among those of his own colour who have presented themselves to the public
judgment, yet when we compare him with the writers of the race among whom he
lived, and particularly with the epistolary class, in which he has taken his
own stand, we are compelled to enroll him at the bottom of the column. This
criticism supposes the letters published under his name to be genuine, and to
have received amendment from no other hand; points which would not be of easy
investigation. The improvement of the blacks in body and mind, in the first
instance of their mixture with the whites, has been observed by every one, and
proves that their inferiority is not the effect merely of their condition of
life. . . .<p>

To justify a general conclusion, requires many observations, even where 
the subject may be submitted to the Anatomical knife, to Optical glasses, 
to analysis by fire, or by solvents.  How much more then where it is a 
faculty, not a substance, we are examining; where it eludes the research 
of all the senses; where the conditions of its existence are various and 
variously combined; where the effects of those which are present or absent 
bid defiance to calculation; let me add too, as a circumstance of great 
tenderness, where our conclusion would degrade a whole race of men from the 
rank in the scale of beings which their Creator may perhaps have given 
them.  To our reproach it must be said, that though for a century and a 
half we have had under our eyes the races of black and of red men, they 
have never yet been viewed by us as subjects of natural history.  I 
advance it therefore as a suspicion only, that the blacks, whether 
originally a distinct race, or made distinct by time and circumstances, are 
inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.  It is not 
against experience to suppose, that different species of the same genus, 
or varieties of the same species, may possess different qualifications.  
Will not a lover of natural history then, one who views the gradations in 
all the races of animals with the eye of philosophy, excuse an effort to 
keep those in the department of man as distinct as nature has formed them?  
This unfortunate difference of colour, and perhaps of faculty, is a 
powerful obstacle to the emancipation of these people.  Many of their 
advocates, while they wish to vindicate the liberty of human nature, are 
anxious also to preserve its dignity and beauty.  Some of these, 
embarrassed by the question 'What further is to be done with them?' join 
themselves in opposition with those who are actuated by sordid avarice 
only.  Among the Romans emancipation required but one effort.  The slave, 
when made free, might mix with, without staining the blood of his master.  
But with us a second is necessary, unknown to history.  When freed, he is 
to be removed beyond the reach of mixture.<p>

	<font size=5>A</font> compelling feature of barge travel is that if you miss a scheduled departure,

you can catch up with your transport by taking a brisk walk. No other carrier

can make that claim. The advantage might not be significant, of course, if the

barge is not worth overtaking, but the one on which my wife and I recently

sailed the Avon and Severn rivers proved worth it to such a degree that a new

line of thought has been forced upon me. With automobiles everywhere checkmated

by other automobiles, with airplanes turned into human freight compartments

endlessly waiting to take off, and with passenger trains all but extinct, the

barge is the likeliest vehicle of the future--more likely by far than the

Concorde.<p>



<p>



Between supersonic flight and transportation by barge a difference in operating

speed will no doubt be quickly detected by the seasoned traveler. While the

Concorde manages to cross the Atlantic in three hours or so, the Beverly K

&amp; Jean K makes it from Stratford to Worcester--a distance of thirty miles

as the dull-witted crow flies--in just under six days, a feat made possible by

a roundabout, hundred-mile route, a four-hour cruising day, time out at the

frequent locks, and side trips through the country by bicycle or minibus.<p>



<p>



In those very figures lies the irresistible law of barge travel: the lower the

speed and the more eccentric the route, the greater the saving in time. The law

works out this way: By reducing the passenger's progress through the

countryside to four and a half miles an hour, with plenty of time to spare for

gawking ashore, the barge allows one to see in a single trip what it would take

forty trips to see by any other means of travel. The saving in time alone is

staggering, and I say nothing here about the saving in money and energy

required to book forty trips with all the necessary connections.<p>



<p>



But, the skeptics are sure to ask, if the idea is to see every blade of grass,

why not walk to begin with? Sheer hypocrisy. Who, except perhaps a few crazed

youths, would want to go scrambling up and down riverbanks, puffing, panting,

and sweating until one has lost the inclination even to look at another willow

reflected in the water, another swan, another bubbling weir, another curve in

the loveliest stream in England? The beauty of floating along on a barge is

precisely that you can see all this and more from a comfortable deck chair--or

through a picture window, if the rain happens to be falling on "England's green

and pleasant land," which it does, after all, less frequently than in the rain

forests of the Amazon, and much more gently. To traverse the Avon by barge is

to walk through England's choicest countryside without getting wet and without

so much as moving a leg.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



As the double name indicates, our barge is twins, with the Beverly's small

diesel pulling the Jean along until they encounter a lock; then the Beverly

goes through under its own power and the Jean is towed along by rope--and by

muscle, when the wind is against the project. Several times a day and always at

night the two handsome craft, as cheerily painted as a carrousel and lined with

flower boxes, tie up alongside one another to allow passengers to move back and

forth between the barge that contains their trim and comfortable cabins and the

one that holds the galley and public lounge. Three gourmet meals a day--besides

coffee and freshly baked cake at eleven and tea and scones at five--are

consumed in that pleasant lounge.<p>



<p>



Those who can't take the strain of watching others crank and uncrank the lock

gates in addition to preparing quiche for lunch and filet mignon for dinner can

always hire a barge and do these things for themselves. But that is the lazy

way out. The Beverly K &amp; Jean K is for those hardier folk who can, out of

the corner of an eye, watch a young woman leaning her fair shape full against a

barge pole to get the craft off a shoal while they sternly work away at seeing

eternity in a blade of grass, or at figuring out whether the next half mile's

prospect looks more like a Turner than a Constable, or at checking on the catch

of scores of dour-faced fishermen lining the banks. Other passengers are

intensely occupied in studying swans as though they might have to account for

them to Her Majesty on Swan-Upping Sunday, or in distinguishing the cry of the

marsh hen from the mating call of the lapwing. Or, not least, they may be

counting the sheep in a steadily receding meadow until that sort of arithmetic

has its usual consequence.<p>



<p>



So the busy days pass, with hardly a minute to look for the stamps one bought

the day before, much less to write a postcard. But the work load is happily

lightened by the side trips to a Cotswold village, an abbey ruin, a pub or two

or three, or an unspoiled market filled with medieval houses in which,

miraculously, people live as routinely as though they were in a walk-up on

Third Avenue or a condominium in Florida.<p>



<p>



Barge travel is not for the many, which is fortunate because every other form

of travel is. All the same, Floating Through Europe, the American enterprise

that owns the Beverly K &amp; Jean K., must be making an impact in England.

Britons line the shore as the barges pull into the dock at Stratford or

Tewkesbury or Worcester. They are clearly awed by these crazy Americans--at

least, on my trip the patrons were Americans--tearing along their waterways at

a speed that would get them across the Atlantic as fast as the Santa Maria.<p>



<p>



Retroactively we had reason to be awed ourselves. After we had disembarked at

Worcester, we were to see no more of the technological wonders of the Beverly K

&amp; Jean K, and to miss them sorely. All too soon we were back in the clumsy

world of hurry-up-and-wait. The car we had hired to meet the barge at nine in

the morning arrived, after much frantic telephoning to Bristol and Birmingham,

at three in the afternoon. If it had not been for the intervention of the

genial skipper, we might still be stranded on the banks of the Severn, along

with five heavy pieces of luggage.<p>



<p>



But we were not to feel that we had really returned to the backward twentieth

century until a few days later we arrived at Heathrow Airport, at three o'clock

on a Friday afternoon. Our jumbo jet, scheduled for departure at four, would

not take off, we were informed, until ten o'clock that night, owing to the sort

of mechanical collapse that is unthinkable with the more soundly engineered

river barge.<p>



<p>



Worse than those seven lost hours in an airport (a person could intimately

probe thirty beautiful miles of the Avon in that time) was our correspondingly

delayed arrival at Kennedy. By the time we had cleared customs at one-thirty in

the morning, suburban limousines had stopped running, attempts to telephone

with English pence proved impractical and a sluggishness hung over the airport,

thicker and less breathable than any sluggishness noticeable in the Vale of

Evesham.<p>



<p>



With no handy barge sailing to Huntington, on Long Island's north shore we had

a choice between an airport hotel for the balance of the night and a $50 taxi

ride. We took the taxi. True, the Beverly K &amp; Jean K, had it been

available, would not have got us home until the following Tuesday, but it would

have been comfortable and we might have come to know and love Long Island Sound

even better than we do. What is more, as on the Avon, we would have done

something to patch up a sound barrier that in recent years has been so often

broken to so little avail.<p>



<p>



[The cruise here described takes seven days (six nights) and will cost, in

1979, from $490 to $520 per passenger, double occupancy, depending on the

season. Prices include all meals (one or two of them in inns on shore),

excursions to such attractions as the Royal Shakespeare Theatre at Stratford

(tickets complimentary), tours through the Cotswolds by minibus, and a visit to

the porcelain factory at Worcester.<p>



<p>



For similar one-week luxury-barge trips on the Thames (for six passengers),

prices are from $550 to $585 per person; in Burgundy, France (twenty-four

passengers), from $575 to $610; and in Holland (twelve passengers), from $555

to $585. Information may be obtained from Floating Through Europe, 501 Madison

Avenue, New York, N. Y. 10022.<p>

<blockquote>

	

	<font size=5>T</font>HOUGH I have not yet been convicted of any caning-worthy offense,

	 I did have my first brush with the law one evening not long ago. I was summoned to the door of

my Singapore apartment by several sets of five sharp, loud knocks. I am still

trying to sort out what followed and why.<p>



I had arrived home at about 9:00 P.M. and finally took pity on the fern left on

the balcony outside my door by the previous resident. I watered it thoroughly,

really soaking the thing. Then I went down to the pool for a late swim.<p>





Wearing nothing but a pair of swim trunks, I was sitting at the dining-room

table under the ceiling fan, writing a letter home, when the first five knocks

came. I took a second to pull a shirt on over my head, and before I could get to

the door, there were five more knocks. By the time I arrived at the door,

barefoot and with my hair messed up, a third round was beginning.<p>



<img src="water.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>



I pulled the door open fast, a little irritated at being bothered after 10:00

P.M., expecting to find my neighbor's kids or--who knows?--a salesman. I was

startled to find two officers, standing shoulder to shoulder in the door frame.

They pretty well filled the opening--or would have if they had been taller. <p>



The moment had the makings of a minor confrontation. I had jerked the door open,

and I hadn't moved back at once. I guess I was annoyed and didn't want to see them

come inside. To my relief they stepped back two feet and pointed off to my

left. I tried to brush my hair down, stepped out onto the doormat, and looked

left. In silence we three gazed at the not very healthy fern.<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE senior guy broke the silence. "You <i>do</i> live here?" he asked. He spoke

in an intelligent voice with an educated British accent. No introductions or

preliminaries, though.<p>

"I do," I said. <p>



"And this <i>is</i> your plant?"<p>



"It is." This was all said very solemnly, and I tried to keep things moving just

a step at a time as I figured out what bothered them about it. Besides, I didn't

seem to be able to come up with responses of more than two words. <p>



What could be the problem? Plant abuse? Obstruction of traffic?<p>



But everyone had plants outside the door, without exception. And without

exception, I admitted to myself, the others looked better than mine.

Insufficient entryway decoration? Was I letting down the side, as they say around

here?<p>



"You are subjecting the neighborhood to the danger of dengue hemorrhagic

fever," the officer announced matter-of-factly, pronouncing "dengue" like

Ben-Gay, the mentholated rub.<p>



"I am?" This time it was a question, not an admission.<p>



"That saucer is a magnet for lethal disease," the officer said without a trace

of humor. "Standing water is precisely what pregnant female mosquitoes are

searching for."<p>



I realize now that I could have said I had done it to be gallant. At the time,

however, it seemed to all of us a very serious situation, and one that had to

be dealt with immediately. <p>



"I understand," I said. "Give me a second and I'll take care of it." They stepped

farther back and watched while I positioned myself to lift the pot without

straining my back. Offering their close supervision but not a hint of

assistance, they watched intently as I squatted down and hoisted the fern up and

pivoted to the side with it. To do this I had to bury my face in the fern, and

when I set it down, it was in front of the doormat and between them and the

doorway.<p>



"I'll be back in a minute," I said nonsensically. Leaving them on the balcony,

I carried the earthenware dish full of muddy water in through the apartment,

trying not to spill it. I had thought for an instant of dumping it off the

balcony, but that would probably come under what is known in newspaper

headlines as the "Killer Litter" law, covering the throwing of any object of any

size off a high-rise and bringing huge fines and prison terms.<p>



The apartment is all bare floors (to go with the bare walls and bare windows),

but I was nonetheless unhappy about dribbling water through the entrance hall,

up the stairs, across the landing, into the bedroom, around the end of the bed,

and into the bathroom, where I emptied the dish into the bathtub, thoroughly

dirtying the tub.<p>



I brought the dish back outside and put it in place, and prepared to lift the

fern into it. By now there were five others on the balcony--the man who appears

to live alone next door and the family of four who leave twelve pairs of shoes

neatly stacked on a two-tiered rack to the right of their door.<p>



"I don't recommend that you do that," the officer said. I stopped and looked up

at him. "Plants do very well here without saucers, and the problem will recur.

You will notice that none of your neighbors use saucers under their plants."<p>



I straightened up and looked up and down the balcony as I made sense of what he

had said. My neighbors stepped back accommodatingly so that I could see.<p>



"You're right," I said. "I won't." I bent down and picked up the heavy saucer, and

then tried to find a different place to set the wet and dirty thing down. I

didn't want it inside, and I didn't want to set it down again outside, because

I had just picked it up. Besides, I thought, one more exchange of words and these

scourges of disease will be on their way and I can take it in and wash it off in

the dirty bathtub and then stow it someplace. Finally I just stood up straight,

holding the thing like a big and awkward steering wheel.<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE officer spoke again, this time in a less official tone. Perhaps he felt

I needed to know that all was forgiven and we could converse a little. Perhaps

he just wanted more information. In any case his conversation was all question

and answer, and question and answer is no conversation. It occurs to me now

that this was the moment he might have issued a citation or a summons, and he

may have been trying to reassure me that he wasn't going to do so.<p>



<u>"You work at the university, is it?" The tag-line question is typical of

Straits Chinese.</u><p>



"I do," I said, thinking simultaneously 1) that professors are supposed to have

all sorts of status and prestige in this culture, whereas I stood there dressed

like a barefoot coolie with mud on my hands, and 2) that if I was of the learned

elite, I ought to have been able to come out with more than monosyllabic

answers.<p>



"I teach courses on politics," I said, knowing as I said it that the last thing

I wanted to do was open the door to a discussion of politics. "American

politics." No, I thought, that's worse still.<p>



"And are you living here alone?"<p>



"Yes, I am alone at this point."<p>



"And will your wife be joining you?" I suppose he might have seen my wedding

ring, well exposed as I stood with the dish covering my stomach, or he might

have had access to forms I had filled out at the university and again at the

condominium-association office. It occurred to me at last to wonder how he had

known where I worked, but I supposed he was kept informed of new arrivals and

their occupations, and it must have been a subject of special interest to all

the police in the neighborhood when, a few years before, the university bought

a half dozen apartments here for putting up medium-term visitors like me--a

steady flow of foreigners on whom to keep an eye.<p>



"She will be coming in a few months," I answered.<p>



"And will you be having other visitors?"<p>



"It's hard to know at this point," I said, not wanting to volunteer that my

father would be joining me in a month or so.<p>



There was a long silence, and I suppose that if it had continued another three

seconds, I would have found something to say, no matter how inane. Instead the

officer pronounced the inanity. "I'm glad you understand, then," he said. "We

all need to work together to do our part to keep Singapore safe and secure and

healthy for all."<p>



I promised I would do my part, and watched as the policemen headed off slowly

along the balcony, inspecting each doorway, plant, and porch light as they

passed. I noticed for the first time that all the porch lights were lit except

mine.<p>



I went back inside, wondering how they could have known about that plant an

hour after I had watered it, and concluding that it must have been my neighbors

who turned me in.<p>



Later I recognized what an effective bit of police work that had been. I don't

think it did much to keep us all from perishing of dengue fever, but it gave me

the message: Big Brother cares about me, and he knows exactly where I 

live.<p>

<i>When the author, a

thirty-five-year-old Lutheran minister, became pastor of Manhattan's Trinity

Lutheran Church in 1961, he found himself in the middle of a political row

involving New York City's redevelopment officials and tenement dwellers in and

near an East River housing site marked for demolition. Set forth here are the

details of that uneven struggle, and the dismaying lesson it holds for the poor

in urban renewal conflicts. This article is adapted from Mr. Simon's book,

FACES OF POVERTY, to be published later this month by Concordia Publishing

House.</i></b><p>

</center>

<p>

<br>

<font size=5>I</font> moved to the Lower East Side in the Spring of 1961 and was immediately struck

by the housing conditions. Most of the blocks are covered by narrow five-story

tenements, each housing from ten to twenty families. The buildings are smack up

against one another and flush to the sidewalk. They are called "old-law

tenements" because they were built during the last century before a new housing

law laid down specifications regarding air space, ventilation, and plumbing.

They are called "walk-ups" because they have no elevators. They were built for

inexpensive, crowded living and have served as the starting point for just

about very wave of immigrants that hit our Eastern shore. That is the reason

the Lower East Side is so cosmopolitan. These immigrant groups huddled in

ghettos and went through all the familiar pains of being the outcasts of the

land before they made their way successfully into the mainstream of American

life. But they always left their traces behind, and the Lower East Side retains

a sprinkling of various ethnic groups -- Italians, Irish, Jews, Poles,

Ukrainians, Germans, Chinese, Negroes, and the most recent arrivals, Puerto

Ricans, our largest single group, who constitute more than one third of the

population of Precinct Nine, where I live. This precinct is smaller than one

square mile but claims more than a hundred thousand residents. <p>



<p>



<p>



The streets are busy streets, alive with people when the weather is warm. The

streets are also dirty. They always bear the traces of garbage that never quite

made it from the battered cans to the sanitation trucks. Sometimes it seems

that both the people and the debris on the streets have oozed out of the

tenements, and in a sense that is so.<p>



<p>



<p>



Most of the tenements have not been maintained properly, though their internal

condition varies  considerably. Two buildings side by side may look almost

identical from the street. Inside, one is relatively well kept, while the one

next to it attacks you with the smell of urine and other odors. The plaster may

be cracked, the stairs unsteady, and obscene words scratched and  scrawled on

the walls. The apartments, too, can be attractive and livable or depressing

depending on the intention of the landlord and the resources of the tenants.<p>



<p>



<p>



Low-income public-housing projects accommodate about 15,000 people on the

eastern side of the precinct along the East River. North of the precinct is a

giant middle-income housing development owned and operated by Metropolitan Life

Insurance Company but it is separated from the precinct both by its affluence

and by Fourteenth Street, a wide and heavily traveled boulevard.<p>



<p>



<p>



Most of the buildings in the tenement area are structurally solid, but

violations of the building code are common -- defective plumbing, no heat, rats,

and the like. These violations go unchecked because slum real estate has become

a profitable business. For a variety of reasons the way to make money on these

buildings is to have many apartments, invest as little cash in them as possible

for maintenance, and let the rents go as high as New York's rent control will

allow. Since landlords are permitted an automatic 15 percent increase every

time there is a change of tenants in an apartment, it can be lucrative to

encourage a rapid turnover of tenants, and unscrupulous landlords have ways of

arranging that, sometimes by direct harassment.<p>



<p>



<p>



Of course there are laws that require landlords to meet minimum standards in

maintaining a building, but these laws are seldom enforced. First of all, a

tenant must file an official complaint with the city, and many do not know how

to file or are afraid of reprisal from the landlord. Second, if a complaint is

filed, let us say with the Department of Buildings, it may be one or two years

before an inspector comes out to check the alleged violation, since the staff

is always inadequate and there is always a tremendous backlog of complaints.<p>



<p>



<p>



If a landlord is charged by the city with a violation, he must be found before

a summons can be issued. Most of the landlords are absentee landlords and some

of them are experts at evading the court. One newspaper item, dated August,

1962, tells of a landlord from Long Beach, Long Island, who was chased by the

city for three years. He was finally handed a summons in the lavatory of his

office building by process servers who hid there and waited sixty hours for

him.<p>



<p>



<p>



Even if the landlord is summoned to court, there is usually not much to worry

about because the penalty is mild -- something like a license to violate the law.

A landlord who is fined $85 for a building with 100 violations may justifiably

consider himself rewarded by such an arrangement. And if he is compelled to

spend money clearing up violations, he usually has dozens or hundreds of other

buildings to make up for such losses many times over.<p>



<p>



<p>



It would be a mistake, however, to single out the landlord and lay all the

blame on his doorstep while ignoring the banks who support him, the political

establishment, which is much more responsible to his real estate interests than

to human suffering, and our own apathy, which permits all this to happen. A

reporter once told me: "Landlords ought to be given medals. They are the heroes

in this housing mess. They are the heroes because they offer themselves as

society's scapegoat. We blame them for everything and get rid of our own guilt

in allowing this kind of situation to exist."<p>



<p>



<p>



The general situation is bad enough to make the visitor or newcomer to our

neighborhood conclude that these tenements ought to be torn down and new

housing constructed, the sooner the better. I was no exception.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



In July of 1961, only a few months after moving to the Lower East Side, I was

asked to take part in a meeting of representatives from neighborhood agencies.

We were told that the city had designated a three-block site, which it called

the Tompkins Square Housing Site, as suitable for urban renewal. It was an area

composed largely of old, small industrial shops and only 165 apartments. A

representative of the city's Housing and Redevelopment Board (HRB) was on hand

to urge that neighborhood leaders participate with the city in working out a

suitable plan for this three-block site.<p>



<p>



<p>



I must admit I was impressed with the attitude of this HRB official toward our

neighborhood. She made it clear that "citizen participation" is one of the

federal requirements which must be met by the city in order to receive urban

renewal funds. The city wanted to find out from neighborhood people what we

needed and wanted. To illustrate how the poor lack political "savvy," I later

found out that on May 1, when the chairman of the City Planning Commission

announced the Tompkins Square Housing Site as suitable for urban renewal, he

had simultaneously announced similar plans for an area two miles across town in

the West Village. The reaction in the two communities was not the same. The

West Village immediately thundered its vote of disapproval at the city's

intention, and, led by Jane Jacobs, the Village Voice, and several articulate

spokesmen, virtually inundated the Board of Estimate with its protest. The

project was dropped. Meanwhile, there was nothing but silence in our

neighborhood. We didn't even know what was going on. Partly as a result of West

Village opposition, the Housing and Redevelopment Board was eager for a smooth

relationship with our neighborhood and had suggested this meeting to request

citizen participation.<p>



<p>



<p>



Out of this request the Tompkins Square Housing Committee was formed and began

to hold public meetings. We recognized a need for renewal, and we took at face

value the clearly expressed wishes of the HRB for community participation. We

naively assumed from official assurances that a genuine dialogue would develop

between the neighborhood and the city.<p>



<p>



<p>



Such a dialogue was never to take place.<p>



<p>



<p>



At first we heard housing experts explain the options open to us. Meanwhile,

five members of our committee interviewed most of the residents on the proposed

site and came up with information that included the following:<p>



 <p>



Tenants paid a median rental of $36.50 per apartment, or an average of $10.08

per room a month.<p>



<p>



<p>



Nearly half of the apartments were overcrowded.<p>



<p>



<p>



Half of the family units had incomes of less than $3000 a year.<p>



<p>



<p>



Nearly three fourths of the tenants said they would like to live in the new

apartments, provided the rents were low enough.<p>



<p>



<p>



Then Robert Dennis, a member of our committee and a city planner (though not in

the employ of the city), together with another city planner and an architect,

formed a team which made a building-by-building examination, not only of the

three-block site but also of another eight blocks immediately to the west and

adjoining the site. They designated each building in one of three categories:

(1) structurally solid and not in need of repair; (2) structurally solid but in

need of code enforcement; and (3) dilapidated buildings which should be

demolished within ten years. The results showed that almost all the buildings,

both on and off the proposed site, fit into category 2.<p>



<p>



<p>



With this information we were able to piece together a kind of proposal that

used this logic:<p>



<p>



<p>



1. Recognizing that most of the people on the site and in the adjoining blocks

had very low incomes, we asked that new housing, though including middle-income

units, be built primarily for the people of the area at rentals they could

afford .<p>



<p>



<p>



2. Most of the apartments on the site were situated in two clusters of

buildings on one corner of the site. Since many tenants had incomes so low that

they could not afford the rentals even of new low-income public housing (which

were then coming in at $16 to $18 a room), or for other reasons might not be

eligible for public housing, we asked the city to redraw the boundary of the

proposed site to exclude those buildings from the site. The supply of low-rent

housing in the city is desperately short, and we felt it would be a mistake to

deplete that supply further unless absolutely necessary.<p>



<p>



<p>



3. We asked that the site be treated not as an isolated area but in relation to

the surrounding blocks, so that this renewal program could become the first

phase of a series of stages to upgrade and replace housing without displacing

large numbers of residents from the neighborhood.<p>



<p>



<p>



4. We suggested that renewal, in its various stages, not simply bulldoze blocks

wholesale but pursue a more selective course to preserve the most habitable

buildings and construct new houses, including perhaps some row houses, in

"vest-pocket" sections.<p>



<p>



<p>



Although we were limited by lack of personnel, time, and funds, we were able to

pick up widespread support for our proposal in the neighborhood. Our

neighborhood council, the Housing Division of LENA (Lower Eastside

Neighborhoods Association), Puerto Rican and civil rights organizations, and

other community groups supported our proposal, and it was clear that the great

majority of neighborhood people who have no institutional voice were also

responding favorably to our approach. Even the local Democratic organization, a

stronghold of Tammany Hall, promised support -- which was later retracted,

presumably under pressure from the city.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Already it was becoming evident that while the HRB was ready to fill us in on

the most general sort of information regarding procedure, there was no

willingness to exchange ideas of substance. We met with Milton Mollen, chairman

of the HRB, and board members on several occasions, and we were always received

with courtesy. But we had no idea what the city planners were producing for the

HRB, nor were we allowed access to their thinking. As the chief of the Project

Development for the HRB said at a meeting with us in August, 1962, the

technicians did not want someone from the neighborhood "peeking over our

shoulders."<p>



<p>



<p>



At HRB headquarters in December, 1962, Chairman Mollen unveiled what he

announced to be not the preliminary concept but "the tentative final concept."

It ignored the key priorities urged by the community and proposed instead a

straight middle-income development of 900 units, with rents up to $30 a room,

but with the possibility of as many as 20 percent of the units skewed down to

$18 a room -- still out of range for most of the site tenants. Mollen emphasized

that the HRB wanted to speed it on to Washington for approval as quickly as

possible.<p>



<p>



<p>



On January 10, 1963, an open meeting was held at Public School 61 on East

Twelfth Street. The entire neighborhood was invited to hear both plans

presented on an equal-time basis. HRB chairman Mollen and his staff members did

so on behalf of the city. Nearly 300 persons (a phenomenal turnout in our

neighborhood) listened to both proposals and asked questions, after which a

motion from the floor to back the neighborhood plan rather than the city's

proposal carried with only four dissenting votes, although there were, no

doubt, other dissenters present.<p>



<p>



<p>



The expression of the community by this time could not have been more evident,

but even that elicited no readiness on the part of the HRB to discuss serious

differences. The HRB continued to use the enormous resources and personnel at

its disposal to garner support for its concept in the face of a clear

neighborhood consensus to the contrary. They did so chiefly by contacting and

soliciting support from a number of groups, most of which had leadership north

of Fourteenth Street and who might, therefore, be prone to favor middle-income

housing as a way of upgrading the area.<p>



<p>



<p>



All of this impressed me as a violation of the needs and interests of people

who had much at stake, but who carried little political weight. It was small

comfort to learn that our experience was not unique but part of a pattern that

affected other neighborhoods of the city.<p>



<p>



Much of our opposition came from well-meaning men who seemed incapable of

putting themselves in the shoes of our neighbors. After repeated invitations

the chief of Project Development of the HRB agreed to tour the site and visit a

few apartments with us. We visited one elderly Jewish lady who showed us her

home. Everything looked old inside, but it was clean and well kept. "It's not

the best," she said, "but it's home. Where else would I go?" We talked

downstairs in the hallway of her building for a while, but what impressed our

city official most seemed to be a garbage can in the hall and a cockroach that

scooted along the wall and almost got on his shoulder. Repeatedly the HRB

officials would wax indignant about the "rat- and roach-infested slums" which

they wanted to remove. They had a point, and living as they did in far better

conditions, they were probably saying what they honestly believed; but they

never seemed to be able to see through the eyes of the poor and understand that

an old, small place is better than no place at all. Nor could any of them

suggest what could be done to house the poor removed by urban renewal other

than to crowd them into the already diminishing supply of low-income housing.<p>



<p>



<p>



This illustrates the strongest argument against urban renewal as now

conceived -- namely, that it usually destroys low-income housing and fails to

replace it because it is basically in the business of middle-income housing.

The net effect is that the slums are simply shifted and spread. For every slum

it destroys, New York creates two new ones.<p>



<p>



<p>



Top officials of the HRB consistently admitted to us, and on occasion said

publicly, that the third of the city's population with no place to go is the

third with incomes of less than $4000 a year, precisely those citizens whose

needs were being bypassed in this urban renewal venture. These same officials

admitted with equal candor that they had no solution for the problem of

low-income housing. Such honesty impressed us but clearly offered no acceptable

way out. Officials appealed to the need for middle-income housing in Manhattan

and asked us to look at the city as a whole, not just at our own neighborhood.

The city's need for more suitable middle-income housing and for higher tax

returns cannot be denied. However, when such needs consistently take priority

and ride roughshod over the obviously more urgent needs of others, one can be

forgiven if one fails to be persuaded by those arguments. They give the poor

little to cheer about. In the last analysis they prove to be another instance

of the welfare state operating for the benefit of those who are fashionably

middle class and of interests such as real estate and the construction

industry, which stand to reap immense profits from such ventures.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Another aspect that concerned us deeply is the history of discrimination

against Negroes and Puerto Ricans to which urban renewal has played partner. It

is not because of misunderstanding but because of suffering that some have

called urban renewal "urban removal" or "Negro removal." Since our whole

pattern of discrimination has forced Negroes and Puerto Ricans into slums and

ghettos, they find themselves living in precisely those areas which the city

designates as blighted and suitable for urban renewal.<p>



<p>



<p>



President Kennedy's Executive Order of November 20, 1963, banning

discrimination in federally aided housing, put an end (at least legally) to the

practice of refusing to rent to Negroes and others for racial or ethnic

reasons. However, that was never the chief form of discrimination in urban

renewal. The chief form was economic, because it displaced minority group

people (in our instance, Puerto Ricans) who were not able to pay rents in the

new buildings. Thus on the Lower East Side, which is both racially mixed and

predominantly low income, the thousands of middle-income housing units that

urban renewal has produced have virtually no Negro or Puerto Rican residents.

These projects have become less a means of giving "balance" to the area than a

way of producing islands of imbalance. Our committee was understandably

concerned about the perpetuation of this pattern in our instance.<p>



<p>



<p>



I have already said that the HRB was able to secure support from organizations

(including one church and several synagogues) whose leadership resided above

Fourteenth Street. Two fall in a different category and deserve special

mention. One was the board of directors of LENA. Our neighborhood council,

which is one of four neighborhood councils making up LENA, endorsed the

committee's plan and opposed the city. So did the Housing Division of LENA. But

the board of directors of that organization is dominated by people who can be

classified as representing the interest of middle-income cooperatives and

business on the southeastern part of the Lower East Side. They have generally

favored middle-income housing over the needs of low-income people. Organized in

terms of power from the top down and not from the bottom up, LENA illustrates

how spokesmen for the poor tend to be people who do not always represent them

favorably.<p>



<p>



<p>



A similar instance was endorsement of the HRB proposal by the borough

president's Planning Board for the Lower East Side. This board has advisory

power only, but as a group of leaders who ostensibly represent the people of

the area its voice carries some weight. Even more so than LENA, the board is

controlled by political, commercial, and middle-income housing interests. (Some

people are members of both boards.) I was appointed to this board, I was told,

as a way of giving "balance" to that body, but there is no balance in sight.

Again the poor are shortchanged in such an arrangement.<p>



<p>



<p>



When the HRB announced its "tentative final" concept and began systematically

rounding up support for that concept, there was no longer any question about

being in dialogue with the city. Officials went through some of the motions.

The borough president paid a surprise visit to our parish house, but it was to

explain, not to listen. Robert Dennis (our city planner) and I learned of one

minor concession in May, 1963, in a final meeting with the chairman and board

members of the HRB (a proposal to include 200 units that would rent possibly as

low as $18 to $20 a room), but this could hardly be confused with dialogue. As

a result, we were left with no alternative but to oppose the city plan. We

corresponded with Robert C. Weaver and officials of the Housing and Home

Finance Agency, protesting in particular that the city had failed to meet the

requirement of citizen participation. The reply was that the mayor's Citizens

Advisory Committee had reviewed and approved the HRB concept and therefore the

legal stipulation had been met. It was the first time I had heard that such a

committee existed. They probably had never heard of us either, and we certainly

had no opportunity to present our ideas to them. After all the promises about

citizen participation we received from the HRB, this small group of well-to-do

citizens, all quite removed from our neighborhood, suddenly became the

authorized vehicle for that participation. We felt we had been made victims of

citizen manipulation.<p>



<p>



<p>



We fought the HRB at City Hall in public hearings before the City Planning

Commission and the Board of Estimate. We were able to produce more speakers

than our opponents; and if speakers who resided outside the neighborhood had

been disqualified, our strength would have been far more apparent.<p>



<p>



<p>



We lost. But we gave the city a hard time and hammered home a point: The poor

must become our first concern in housing, not our last concern. Late in 1965 it

was announced by the HRB that the number of the moderately priced units,

financed under Section 221-d-3 of the National Housing Act, was increased from

200 to 370 -- but with estimated average rentals of $26.50 per room. Under this

arrangement a one-bedroom apartment will rent for $106 to $111 per month, plus

utilities.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The relation of Stuyvesant Town to the area south of Fourteenth Street is a

modern classic example of evils that are showered upon the poor in and through

housing because they are politically expendable. Stuyvesant Town covers

eighteen city blocks and houses 22,405 people, according to the 1960 census.

Until the end of World War II those blocks were an extension of the old,

dilapidated tenement houses south of Fourteenth Street. Economic and racial

factors and mutual suspicion separate residents below and above Fourteenth

Street. People who live in Stuyvesant Town usually do not like to go south of

Fourteenth Street to shop or visit or attend church. Not many of them send

children to school south of Fourteenth Street, but to vastly superior schools

west of the development. They are afraid and disgusted by what they see below

Fourteenth Street. A local paper that circulates to every apartment in

Stuyvesant Town encourages such fear in dramatizing the most sordid features of

the tenement area and speaks in glaring headlines of the young hoodlums and

punks below Fourteenth Street who attack or rob people in Stuyvesant Town. On

the other hand, people south of Fourteenth Street do not know their neighbors

to the north. They are not welcome to play on the streets or playgrounds of

Stuyvesant Town because it is private property watched by uniformed guards.

Fourteenth Street is sometimes called the Barrier.<p>



<p>



<p>



In 1940 about 15,000 people lived in those blocks. Most of them were poor. In

1943, under a new state law and by contract with the city, Metropolitan Life

Insurance Company agreed to buy the land from the city at a drastically

depreciated price. The city was willing to bear the loss on this in return for

anticipated gains in property taxes later on. The bulldozers moved in, and

thousands of families were evacuated. Hardly any of them were rehoused in the

new buildings that were completed between 1947 and 1949.<p>



<p>



<p>



Metropolitan Life made Stuyvesant Town middle class and white, reflecting a

strong impulse to create a suburban community in Manhattan, a non-city city. In

keeping with the mood of the 1940s, it openly discriminated against Negroes

until pressure from the city council led Metropolitan Life to admit three Negro

Families in 1950. An ordinance passed by the city council the following year

made discrimination in such projects illegal. However, according to the 1960

census -- a decade after Stuyvesant Town agreed to integrate -- only 47 persons

from a total population of 22,405 were Negroes, barely two tenths of one

percent. If one includes the 16 Puerto Ricans, that would raise the integration

percentage to almost three tenths of one percent, three Negroes and Puerto

Ricans out of every thousand residents!<p>



<p>



<p>



Several things happened with the creation of Stuyvesant Town. First, thousands

of people, most of them poor, had to move off the property. The cancer of slums

spread elsewhere. Second, the new housing units were not only economically

stratified but racially restrictive as well. Even more is at stake, however,

for injustice has a way of reaching out in all directions. Consider the matter

of education.<p>



<p>



<p>



Since the latter part of 1963, when long overdue pressure for quality and

integrated schools in New York suggested the possibility of exchanging more

children in both directions across Fourteenth Street, a furor was created by

parents in Stuyvesant Town and elsewhere above Fourteenth Street. In public

meetings many residents spoke self-righteously of conditions below Fourteenth

Street, defending indignantly the sanctity of the neighborhood school. If a

project like Stuyvesant Town systematically excludes people, and if the

residents of that project exclude themselves from responsibility toward the

misery of neighbors whose community they have invaded, is it fair to blame the

excluded ones for conditions that are characteristic of crowded ghettos? Or to

be surprised that Negroes and Puerto Ricans and others are desperate for a

break in this ugly pattern? One may ask also what price Stuyvesant Town

residents ultimately pay in moral currency for living in a middle-class ghetto.

What we see happening in Stuyvesant Town is precisely the same flight from

reality represented by most suburban communities.<p>



<p>



<p>



Unlike the area below Fourteenth Street, Stuyvesant Town is to be reckoned with

politically. In terms of financial resources, organization, and ability to

articulate their desires, residents of Stuyvesant Town carry a

disproportionately strong voice in the decision-making process, as effective

blocking of any school pairing demonstrated.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



On the eastern edge of Precinct Nine is a large strip of low-income public

housing (Jacob Riis and Lillian Wald projects) with a population total of

approximately 15,000. This figure includes about an equal number of Negro,

Puerto Rican, and Caucasian tenants. Rents range from $11 to $18 a room per

month in these two projects, with the rent based on income, number of

dependents in a family, and other factors. The Jacob Riis and Lillian Wald

projects in some respects also represent a form of discrimination against the

poor, although such projects were obviously conceived and are operated for the

benefit of low-income families.<p>



<p>



<p>



For many, public housing represents their only live option for decent housing,

and critics of public housing should not forget that. At the present time there

is a backlog of 120,000 applicants for public housing in the city of New York.

Only 10 percent of the applicants make it in any given year. Some do not apply

because they cannot afford even the lowest rents in public housing, and some

cannot qualify because of such factors as illegitimate children or incidence of

crime in the family.<p>



<p>



<p>



In some respects public housing is sick. It is sick primarily because it dumps

low-income families into one economically (and often racially) segregated pile.

There is nothing intrinsically bad about poor people living together. It is

bad, however, when they are systematically excluded from living with others,

and when 15,000 people are legally penalized by constantly draining off their

most economically successful families and their leadership. This happens

because to qualify for public housing, one must not earn more than a specified

income (depending upon family size, and so forth). Thus the most stable and

helpful members of such developments -- precisely those who are best situated to

help it achieve some sense of community -- are continually being evicted.<p>



<p>



<p>



The most obvious result of this situation in public housing is that the slums

tend to invade these projects. Tenants have to take the onus with the bonus,

for such projects become stigmatized, and residents are often made to feel not

quite human for living there. Demoralization sets in.<p>



<p>



<p>



There is a less obvious result of public housing's policy of evicting

leadership. Politically the poor are robbed of some of their strongest

spokesmen and best organizers. When they leave, these aspiring and successful

residents in public housing cannot be expected to retain their sympathy for the

suffering they once knew; and even if they do, they are usually too far away to

do much about it. One outcome of this is that the poor, kept in isolation and

with only a whisper of a political voice, can easily be bypassed when public

policy is made.<p>



<p>



<p>



Isolated in ghettos of poverty, abandoned by yesterday's poor who now live

separate lives in new middle-class ghettos, the very poor find themselves

outside the mainstream of concern. Like Samson, they have been shorn of their

strength and left to tread the mill.<p>



<p>



<p>



Often we do not allow them even that dignity.<p>

are properly called <b><i>shelled</b></i> and <b><i>peeled</i></b>. In cases like these the

													<!--BARBARA"S RESPONSE TEXT-->

	No, you're not. <b><i>Feel </i></b> confuses people because it can serve either

as a garden-variety transitive or intransitive verb or as a slightly more

rarefied "copula," or linking verb. Consider the difference between "When I

check the dog for ticks, I <i><b>feel carefully </i></b> behind his ears" and "When I

check the dog for ticks, I feel like a responsible person: I <i><b>feel

careful</i></b> ." In the first case <i><b>feel </i></b> is being modified by an adverb

(<i><b>carefully </i></b>). In the second case it is linking the subject to an

adjective (<i><b>careful </i></b>), which is modifying not the verb but the subject

itself. (To confirm our grasp of this point, let's ponder what "I <i><b>feel

badly </i></b>" means. Despite what most people seem to think, 

<i><b>badly </i></b> is an

adverb only, and therefore it must be modifying <i><b>feel </i></b>. This sentence,

then, does have to do with a deficient tactile sense. "I <i><b>feel 

bad </i></b>" is

the way to signify discomfiture.)<p>



<i><b>Well</i></b>, too, confuses people, and for a similar reason: it can serve

either as an adverb, modifying a verb ("He swims<i><b>well </i></b> now that he has

taken lessons"), or as an adjective, modifying a noun or pronoun ("He is<i><b>well </b></i>now that he has taken his medicine"). As you can see, the two

constructions can look quite a lot alike--the difference is in what they

mean.<p>



Indeed, "I <i><b>feel well </i></b>" <i><b>could </i></b> be referring to your tactile

abilities--just as "Time flies when you're having fun" could be a command. The

only thing is, it's not. "I <i><b>feel well </i></b>" is a perfectly good way to

describe your state of health. "I <i><b>feel good </i></b>" would also work

well--although it is perhaps more descriptive of a mental state.

Books<i><b>: "On the minority side an enormous fuss is now being made over adding

a little extra child care, some odd bits of child nutrition aid, perhaps a

little foster care: </i></b>literally<i><b> arranging flowers on the coffin of the

provision for children in the Social Security Act." I have noticed such usages

of the word </i></b>literally<i><b> many times in the past few years--that is, as a

term of emphasis. What is your feeling about the correctness of this usage?

What might serve as an alternative--one that preserves the original meaning of

</i></b>literally<i><b> yet at the same time allows writers to convey the emphasis

they evidently so desire?</i></b><p>

The figurative use of <i><b>literally </i></b> is like the common cold:

widespread and evidently incurable. Certainly it's objectionable. For one

thing, the whole idea is self-contradictory. For another, the results are often

unintentionally so funny that the speaker or writer might as well have slipped

on a banana peel--and few people think it's good form to do that.<p>



Bless you, though, for recognizing that people who misuse the word have some

goal in mind other than to make themselves ridiculous. The best alternative to

misusing <i><b>literally </i></b> tends to be simply to leave it out and let one's

figure of speech do its job. If one doesn't trust that figure of speech to make

the point, then the figure is the problem, and weighing it down with

<i><b>literally </i></b> isn't going to help.<br>

<blockquote>

	

	<font size=5>T</font>HOUGH I have not yet been convicted of any caning-worthy offense,

	 I did have my first brush with the law one evening not long ago. I was summoned to the door of

my Singapore apartment by several sets of five sharp, loud knocks. I am still

trying to sort out what followed and why.<p>



I had arrived home at about 9:00 P.M. and finally took pity on the fern left on

the balcony outside my door by the previous resident. I watered it thoroughly,

really soaking the thing. Then I went down to the pool for a late swim.<p>





Wearing nothing but a pair of swim trunks, I was sitting at the dining-room

table under the ceiling fan, writing a letter home, when the first five knocks

came. I took a second to pull a shirt on over my head, and before I could get to

the door, there were five more knocks. By the time I arrived at the door,

barefoot and with my hair messed up, a third round was beginning.<p>



<img src="water.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>



I pulled the door open fast, a little irritated at being bothered after 10:00

P.M., expecting to find my neighbor's kids or--who knows?--a salesman. I was

startled to find two officers, standing shoulder to shoulder in the door frame.

They pretty well filled the opening--or would have if they had been taller. <p>



The moment had the makings of a minor confrontation. I had jerked the door open,

and I hadn't moved back at once. I guess I was annoyed and didn't want to see them

come inside. To my relief they stepped back two feet and pointed off to my

left. I tried to brush my hair down, stepped out onto the doormat, and looked

left. In silence we three gazed at the not very healthy fern.<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE senior guy broke the silence. "You <i>do</i> live here?" he asked. He spoke

in an intelligent voice with an educated British accent. No introductions or

preliminaries, though.<p>

"I do," I said. <p>



"And this <i>is</i> your plant?"<p>



"It is." This was all said very solemnly, and I tried to keep things moving just

a step at a time as I figured out what bothered them about it. Besides, I didn't

seem to be able to come up with responses of more than two words. <p>



What could be the problem? Plant abuse? Obstruction of traffic?<p>



But everyone had plants outside the door, without exception. And without

exception, I admitted to myself, the others looked better than mine.

Insufficient entryway decoration? Was I letting down the side, as they say around

here?<p>



"You are subjecting the neighborhood to the danger of dengue hemorrhagic

fever," the officer announced matter-of-factly, pronouncing "dengue" like

Ben-Gay, the mentholated rub.<p>



"I am?" This time it was a question, not an admission.<p>



"That saucer is a magnet for lethal disease," the officer said without a trace

of humor. "Standing water is precisely what pregnant female mosquitoes are

searching for."<p>



I realize now that I could have said I had done it to be gallant. At the time,

however, it seemed to all of us a very serious situation, and one that had to

be dealt with immediately. <p>



"I understand," I said. "Give me a second and I'll take care of it." They stepped

farther back and watched while I positioned myself to lift the pot without

straining my back. Offering their close supervision but not a hint of

assistance, they watched intently as I squatted down and hoisted the fern up and

pivoted to the side with it. To do this I had to bury my face in the fern, and

when I set it down, it was in front of the doormat and between them and the

doorway.<p>



"I'll be back in a minute," I said nonsensically. Leaving them on the balcony,

I carried the earthenware dish full of muddy water in through the apartment,

trying not to spill it. I had thought for an instant of dumping it off the

balcony, but that would probably come under what is known in newspaper

headlines as the "Killer Litter" law, covering the throwing of any object of any

size off a high-rise and bringing huge fines and prison terms.<p>



The apartment is all bare floors (to go with the bare walls and bare windows),

but I was nonetheless unhappy about dribbling water through the entrance hall,

up the stairs, across the landing, into the bedroom, around the end of the bed,

and into the bathroom, where I emptied the dish into the bathtub, thoroughly

dirtying the tub.<p>



I brought the dish back outside and put it in place, and prepared to lift the

fern into it. By now there were five others on the balcony--the man who appears

to live alone next door and the family of four who leave twelve pairs of shoes

neatly stacked on a two-tiered rack to the right of their door.<p>



"I don't recommend that you do that," the officer said. I stopped and looked up

at him. "Plants do very well here without saucers, and the problem will recur.

You will notice that none of your neighbors use saucers under their plants."<p>



I straightened up and looked up and down the balcony as I made sense of what he

had said. My neighbors stepped back accommodatingly so that I could see.<p>



"You're right," I said. "I won't." I bent down and picked up the heavy saucer, and

then tried to find a different place to set the wet and dirty thing down. I

didn't want it inside, and I didn't want to set it down again outside, because

I had just picked it up. Besides, I thought, one more exchange of words and these

scourges of disease will be on their way and I can take it in and wash it off in

the dirty bathtub and then stow it someplace. Finally I just stood up straight,

holding the thing like a big and awkward steering wheel.<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE officer spoke again, this time in a less official tone. Perhaps he felt

I needed to know that all was forgiven and we could converse a little. Perhaps

he just wanted more information. In any case his conversation was all question

and answer, and question and answer is no conversation. It occurs to me now

that this was the moment he might have issued a citation or a summons, and he

may have been trying to reassure me that he wasn't going to do so.<p>



<u>"You work at the university, is it?" The tag-line question is typical of

Straits Chinese.</u><p>



"I do," I said, thinking simultaneously 1) that professors are supposed to have

all sorts of status and prestige in this culture, whereas I stood there dressed

like a barefoot coolie with mud on my hands, and 2) that if I was of the learned

elite, I ought to have been able to come out with more than monosyllabic

answers.<p>



"I teach courses on politics," I said, knowing as I said it that the last thing

I wanted to do was open the door to a discussion of politics. "American

politics." No, I thought, that's worse still.<p>



"And are you living here alone?"<p>



"Yes, I am alone at this point."<p>



"And will your wife be joining you?" I suppose he might have seen my wedding

ring, well exposed as I stood with the dish covering my stomach, or he might

have had access to forms I had filled out at the university and again at the

condominium-association office. It occurred to me at last to wonder how he had

known where I worked, but I supposed he was kept informed of new arrivals and

their occupations, and it must have been a subject of special interest to all

the police in the neighborhood when, a few years before, the university bought

a half dozen apartments here for putting up medium-term visitors like me--a

steady flow of foreigners on whom to keep an eye.<p>



"She will be coming in a few months," I answered.<p>



"And will you be having other visitors?"<p>



"It's hard to know at this point," I said, not wanting to volunteer that my

father would be joining me in a month or so.<p>



There was a long silence, and I suppose that if it had continued another three

seconds, I would have found something to say, no matter how inane. Instead the

officer pronounced the inanity. "I'm glad you understand, then," he said. "We

all need to work together to do our part to keep Singapore safe and secure and

healthy for all."<p>



I promised I would do my part, and watched as the policemen headed off slowly

along the balcony, inspecting each doorway, plant, and porch light as they

passed. I noticed for the first time that all the porch lights were lit except

mine.<p>



I went back inside, wondering how they could have known about that plant an

hour after I had watered it, and concluding that it must have been my neighbors

who turned me in.<p>



Later I recognized what an effective bit of police work that had been. I don't

think it did much to keep us all from perishing of dengue fever, but it gave me

the message: Big Brother cares about me, and he knows exactly where I 

live.<p>

<font size=5>Y</font>OUTH has become the most frequent topic of 

conversation in jazz.  The talk concerns a crop of instrumentalists in 

their twenties and very early thirties, including the tenor saxophonists 

Joshua Redman and James Carter, the trumpeters Roy Hargrove and Nicholas 

Payton, the pianists Cyrus Chestnut and Jacky Terrasson, and the bassist 

Christian McBride, who are supposedly luring audiences their own age and 

younger to jazz.  <P>







This accent on youth could be interpreted as an effort to shake the blues 

of just a few years ago, when all anybody in jazz seemed to talk about was 

death. Sarah Vaughan died early in 1990, followed in less than three years 

by <a href="http://www.actlab.utexas.edu/~horshak/greatday/blakey.html">

Art Blakey</a>, Stan Getz, Miles Davis, and <a href="http://www.mtn.org/dcs

/Artists/DizQuiz/DQ00.html">Dizzy Gillespie</a>. Along with 

grief, these deaths triggered panic that time might also be running out 

for jazz as a commercially viable form of music. Jazz was already short of 

marquee names when the nineties began; the loss of five more left what 

threatened to become a permanent void at the top of the bill.<P>



Some New York&#173;based critics blamed their city's club owners and the 

producers of the annual <a href="http://www.jazzcentralstation.com/jcs/

station/jazzdest/festivals/index.html">JVC Jazz Festival</a> 

for having failed to groom 

successors to bebop's aging stars. JVC, in particular, was in danger of 

becoming an annual series of memorial concerts. Even so, the assumption 

that presenters of live music still turn the crank of the star-making 

machinery strikes me as naive. <P>



Duke Ellington used to say that he was born in Newport, Rhode Island, in 

1956. He meant reborn at that summer's Newport Jazz Festival, when an 

outbreak of dancing in the aisles during his band's performance of 

"Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue" helped to land him on the cover of 

<I>Time</I>. Most of today's major festivals are in Europe, though, and 

there are far too many of them for any single one to matter in quite the 

same way that Newport used to. <P>



An increasing number of festivals defray their costs by subletting their 

stages to record companies for "An Afternoon With Blue Note" or "An 

Evening With Columbia." In most cases the entire festival might as well be 

programmed by record companies, because only performers who have a major 

label's publicity campaign behind them draw big crowds today. Word of 

mouth about a newcomer or a resurgent veteran can still begin at an 

overseas festival, in a New York nightclub, or occasionally in a favorable 

notice by an influential critic. But only the major labels have the juice 

to amplify such word of mouth into what broadcasters and newspaper and 

magazine editors traditionally unreceptive to jazz might recognize as a 

buzz. Once a buzz gets started, the role of everyone who hopes to win 

bigger numbers for jazz--including compliant critics--becomes to 

keep it going.<P>

<BR>



<font size=5>T</font>HE loudest buzz right now is about the above-named younger musicians, who 

are credited with bringing jazz back to life or--what might amount to 

the same thing--putting more warm bodies into the seats. It should 

come as no surprise that the most talked-about of them happen to record 

for the large companies. <a href= "http://www.jazzradio.org/Clients/MurrayStreet

/Jazz/JoshuaRedmanBio.HTML">Joshua Redman</a> may prove to be the most talented 

in the group; at twenty-seven, he's already far and away the most 

successful, with sales of each of his first three Warner Bros. albums 

having topped 100,000. Last fall DKNY Menswear (the designer Donna Karan's 

line of casual wear for "the urban guy who lives for the risk") outfitted 

Redman and his sidemen for their fifty-city tour to promote <I>Spirit of 

the Moment: Live at the Village Vanguard </I>(Warner Bros. 9 45923-2), 

Redman's fourth release. This was hailed as a breakthrough: pop stars who 

go on the road to promote their new albums can usually count on corporate 

sponsorship to offset the costs of their tours, but jazz performers are 

rarely so blessed. <P>



With corporate underwriting taking the place of federal arts funding, we 

may soon see a new form of Social Darwinism: survival of the cutest. In 

addition to being photogenic, Redman is good copy twice over--as a 

second-generation jazz musician (his father is the tenor saxophonist Dewey 

Redman, formerly a sideman with Ornette Coleman and a member of Old and 

New Dreams), and even more so as a Harvard summa cum laude who passed up 

Yale Law School for a career in jazz. <P>



You could call it the <a href="http://www.jazzradio.org/Clients/MurrayStreet/

Jazz/WyntonMarsalisBio.HTML">Wynton Marsalis</a> factor. Every ten years or so, for a 

different set of reasons each time, cultural trendsetters rally behind one 

musician with whom they sense a bond and who then comes to symbolize jazz 

to the mass media. Before Marsalis it happened in turn to Dave Brubeck, 

Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett. Marsalis improbably 

combined youthful arrogance with an obeisance to tradition that bordered 

on ancestor worship; Columbia's success in marketing him persuaded the 

other majors that the trick to selling jazz was to play up its genealogy 

and long history of esoteric appeal even while attempting to demystify it 

by means of trim young figures in designer suits. Though unprecedented in 

recent memory, the election of a <I>type</I> of musician to carry the 

banner for jazz was probably inevitable, given the difficulty of finding 

another performer as charismatic as Marsalis and given the longstanding 

preference of magazine editors for pieces on jazz "trends," as opposed to 

on individual musicians. <P>



At thirty-four, <A 

HREF="http://www.jazzworld.com/Artist_Info/wyntonmarsalis/">Marsalis is 

more visible than ever</A>, what with his recent books and radio and 

television programs.  But he doesn't sell as many albums as he used to, and 

tempting as it is to put the blame for this on a combination of 

overexposure and the ill will he has aroused as the artistic director of <A 

HREF="http://www.jazzworld.com/JALC/about.html">Jazz at Lincoln Center</a> 

(he has been accused of cronyism, ageism, reverse racism, and 

narrow-mindedness in closing the doors of that establishment to reputed 

avant-gardists), I think there's another explanation--one entirely to 

Marsalis's credit as an artist unwilling to let his audience tell him who 

he is.  <P>



Marsalis initially won mass acceptance as a kind of substitute<a href="

http://www.wam.umd.edu/~losinp/music/ahead.html"> Miles 

Davis</a>, and many of his fans were taken by surprise when his efforts to 

define himself as a composer led him to embrace New Orleans polyphony and 

Duke Ellington's talking horns. Marsalis's dance suites and extended 

compositions have been extremely uneven, but the problem with them from 

the standpoint of units sold may be that dance suites and extended 

compositions simply aren't what his fans expect from him or want from 

jazz. Marsalis's emphasis on composition has created an opening for Redman 

and the others. None has yet demonstrated much interest in larger forms, 

though many have inherited some of Marsalis's other traits, including his 

attitude toward tradition and innovation.<P>



The animosity with which a lot of jazz critics regard Marsalis owes 

something to his having usurped their authority. His pronouncements on 

jazz in interviews and in occasional bylined articles carry more weight 

with readers than do those of any of us who write regularly about jazz 

(including even Albert Murray and Stanley Crouch, Marsalis's associates at 

Lincoln Center). And in turning thumbs down on most of the innovations in 

jazz since 1960--in vehemently insisting that it can't be jazz if it 

doesn't swing from beginning to end and explicitly refer to the 

blues--Marsalis has been telling disgruntled longtime listeners 

exactly what they were waiting to hear. <P>



I used to believe that what scared most people away from jazz was their 

suspicion that they would be bored by it. In the case of much latter-day 

bebop, with its lineup of soloists running down the chords to no apparent 

purpose after stating a sketchy theme not to be heard again until the end, 

boredom is a reasonable response. The solution, I always thought, was to 

expose people to kinds of jazz in which composition and improvisation 

overlap, and in which something is going on in every measure. It wouldn't 

have to be Muhal Richard Abrams or Sun Ra or anything too far out; it 

could be Ellington or <a href="http://amadeus.siba.fi/~eonttone/mingus/">

Charles Mingus</a> or even Marsalis's score for the 1990 

movie <I>Tune In Tomorrow</I>. But if new audiences are flocking to jazz 

on the heels of a generation of musicians who were themselves receptive to 

Marsalis's ideology at an impressionable age, I must be wrong. People who 

have never really listened to jazz want it to go on sounding the way 

they've been led to believe it should, so that they'll be able to 

recognize it in case they ever chance to hear any.<P>



Longtime jazz listeners, for their part, want jazz to be as it was in the 

fifties and early sixties, when a devotion to jazz was still a sign of 

being hip. <a href="http://metrobeat.com:80/nyc/locations/lmc0174.html">

Iridium</a>, a fairly new Manhattan club, features on its menu 

mixed drinks described as "retro cocktails." The adjective could also be 

applied to most of the music now heard in New York's front-line 

clubs--especially when the players on the bandstand are roughly the 

age that Miles Davis and <a href="http://www.inetworld.net/~keith/coltrane.

john/">John Coltrane</a> are in those vintage 

black-and-whites on the walls of the <a href="http://metrobeat.com/nyc/

locations/lmc0274.html">Village Vanguard</a>.<P>

<BR>



<font size=5>T</font>HE most evocative of all jazz photographs might be one taken by Art Kane 

for a 1959 issue of <I>Esquire</I>, showing fifty-seven musicians, famous 

and obscure, posed outside a brownstone on East 126th Street in Harlem. 

Inspired by the success of Jean Bach's lovely 1994 film <a href="

http://www.beatthief.com/greatday.html"><I>A Great Day in 

Harlem</I></a>, which examined both Kane's photograph and what else went on 

among the musicians that day, <I>Life</I> magazine last fall assembled ten 

of the twelve survivors to have their picture taken outside the same 

brownstone (now gutted and missing its cornice). By coincidence, it was 

the day of the Million Man March, when there was much talk on radio and 

television about the shortage of positive male role models in black 

communities. Some exemplary role models were on the steps in Harlem that 

day: dedicated artists and family men such as the tenor saxophonist Benny 

Golson, the trumpeter Art Farmer, the bassist Milt Hinton, and the pianist 

Hank Jones. Jazz could also offer inspiration in the stories of those 

musicians who reclaimed their lives from drugs (for every Charlie Parker 

there's a Sonny Rollins). That jazz goes virtually unmentioned in the 

national discourse on race underlines its diminished relevance to everyday 

African-American life. <P>



If this helps to explain why the emergence of talented instrumentalists 

not much older than the members of Boyz II Men answers a prayer, it also 

raises the question of whether a player's race much matters at this point. 

All but a few of the younger musicians being pushed by major labels are 

black; this has created a backlash of sorts among white musicians, who 

feel left out. <P>



The harshest critics of today's newcomers are not whites but musicians 

over forty who lament that they themselves were young too soon--a 

decade or so before Marsalis, when an unspoken grandfather clause was in 

effect at record companies and only old masters whose careers pre-dated 

rock-and-roll were eligible for jazz stardom. "The young lions," as 

everyone seems to call today's young musicians, are an easy sell to 

longtime jazz fans, who recall the seventies and early eighties with a 

shudder. Unlike their immediate elders, these newcomers don't have 

synthesizers in their closets to apologize for. Nor are they asked to 

atone for the excesses of the period, not so long ago, when cutting-edge 

jazz was associated with a black-separatist agenda. However much they 

revere the past, they're not tainted by its compromises, as musicians who 

actually lived through it tend to be. <P>



Nobody resents these recent arrivals for making a splash. Instead they're 

resented for <I>not</I> making waves the way <a href="

http://www.roughguides.com/RG_WWW/JAZZ/PARKER.html">Charlie Parker</a> and Dizzy 

Gillespie did in the 1940s and young players have been counted on to do 

periodically ever since. (Even Marsalis stirred things up, albeit in his 

own way.) There are no <a href="http://www.achilles.net:80/~howardm/

tsmonk.html">Thelonious Monks</a> or <a href="http://www.eyeneer.com/Jazz/

Ornette/index.html">Ornette Colemans</a> in this 

bunch--no innovators or woolly eccentrics among those we've heard from 

so far. In setting craftsmanship as their highest goal these neophytes 

remind me of such second-tier stars of the fifties and sixties as Blue 

Mitchell and Wynton Kelly--players whose modesty and good taste made 

them ideal sidemen but whose own record dates invariably lacked the dark 

corners and disfigurements of character that separate great music from 

merely good. <P>

<BR>



<font size=5>S</font>OMETHING further inhibiting this latest generation is the idea that the 

future of their art form, as well as their own careers, rides on the 

commercial success of their CDs. In concert Roy Hargrove can be positively 

fiery, but his albums--including the recent <I>Parker's Mood</I> 

(Verve 314 527 907-2), a collection of tunes written by or associated with 

Charlie Parker which also features Christian McBride and the pianist 

Stephen Scott--have been cautious and bland. The same is true of 

Nicholas Payton, a prodigiously gifted trumpeter barely out of his teens 

whose work on <I>From This Moment </I>. . . (Verve 314 527 073-2) comes 

across as "mature" in all the wrong ways, owing to an overabundance of 

medium tempos and minor keys, plus the restraining effect of no fewer than 

three chording instruments (Mulgrew Miller's piano, Mark Whitfield's 

guitar, and Monty Croft's vibes).<P>



Blandness and premature solemnity aren't among James Carter's worries. If 

anything, he would do well to calm down. Carter's main horn is tenor, but 

he's also proficient on a variety of other reeds and woodwinds, including 

soprano, alto, and baritone saxophones. He's the only one of the 

major-label young players with avant-garde credentials, having worked with 

Lester Bowie and the late Julius Hemphill, among others, before starting 

his own quartet. Because of this, he's regarded by many as a kind of gap 

sealer--a figure who deserves praise for drawing on both "inside" and 

"outside" approaches to improvisation. Carter might erupt in screams even 

on a ballad or a medium-tempo groove tune, his rhythm section suspending 

the beat as it pummels its instruments into cacophony. This lends an 

element of unpredictability to Carter's solos, but the problem is that his 

solos are always unpredictable in exactly the same way. I suspect that 

even those listeners who shun what used to be called free jazz for fear of 

just such episodes willingly go along with Carter because they know his 

paroxysms will be short-lived. Minus the thematic development that is 

possible in free improvisation, his farrago-like solos reduce thirty years 

of sonic exploration to a handy vocabulary of stock effects not much 

different from the honks and screams of the average rhythm-and-blues 

saxophonist of the 1950s. <P>



Even so, Carter's virtues almost outweigh his faults.  Though primarily 

influenced by John Coltrane, Wayne Shorter, and Sonny Rollins, today's 

tenor saxophonists have begun to investigate the work of a host of muscular 

and once overlooked players of the 1950s and 1960s, typified by the late 

Gene Ammons.  Not for nothing were Ammons and others of this school (whose 

own role models were Arnett Cobb, Illinois Jacquet, and Ben Webster) 

frequently referred to as "tough" tenors.  They turned up-tempo numbers 

into bloody brawls and more or less shadowed the melody on ballads, like a 

pulp detective tailing a beautiful woman he thinks he's falling in love 

with but doesn't quite trust.  The style calls for a lot of swagger, and 

Carter might be the only young saxophonist who has the size for it.  His 

best recorded performances in this vein, in which he displays an effortless 

swing rare for an improviser of any age, are his two versions of Duke 

Ellington's "The Stevedore's Serenade," one on <I>The Real Quietstorm</I> 

(Atlantic Jazz 82742) and the other on a promotional CD of duets with Cyrus 

Chestnut from early last year, which was distributed to journalists and 

radio stations but not released commercially. <P>



<I>The Real Quietstorm</I>--not a make-out album, despite its title 

and cover shot of Carter with his fianc&eacute;e draped all over 

him--opens and closes with examples of Carter's graceful control of 

his baritone saxophone's upper register. He's such a talented musician 

that it becomes all the more frustrating when he screams gratuitously, 

when he taps the keys of his saxophone while breathing into it to produce 

a sound like that of a rusty pipe, when he slurps up to a note or holds a 

note for several measures--these are devices that can be put to 

imaginative use, but twenty-seven is awfully young for a musician to be 

falling back on them on nearly every number. Carter's most questionable 

trait may be his habit of interpolating familiar licks from Ellington, 

Gershwin, and Charlie Parker into solos in which they simply don't belong. 

Quoting can be an art; <a href="http://pantheon.cis.yale.edu/~jnilsen/

dex.html">Dexter Gordon</a> was a master at jimmying one song's 

chords until they fit the chords of another. His quotations were often 

delightful for being so off the wall. Carter's are merely patterns that 

fall easily under his fingers and help to kill time: musical equivalents 

of borrowing "To be or not to be" or "All the world's a stage." The one he 

ought to try is "To thine own self be true."<P>

<BR>



<font size=5>W</font>HEN I saw Carter perform at the Montreal International Jazz Festival last 

summer, he strutted across the stage as if he were already a star, 

displaying an abundance of what a rock or hip-hop audience might call 

attitude. His playing was loopy, even by his own standards. My notes don't 

mention what he was wearing, but if I close my eyes and recall the spin 

and pop of his phrases, I can see him dressed to kill in a long-tailed 

yellow zoot suit and a feathered fedora, like Jim Carrey in <I>The 

Mask</I>. I kept expecting him to roll himself into a bouncing rubber 

ball, or to hiss with satisfaction, <a href="http://www.inforamp.net

/~petroff/jpg/mask.jpg">"<I>Sss</I>omebody <I>sss</I>top me!" </a>

Carter seems that intent on turning himself into a special 

effect--though so much sanctimony now surrounds jazz that his 

insincerity is refreshing, in a curious sort of way. Carter's most recent 

release, <I>Conversin' With the Elders </I>(Atlantic Records ATL 82908), 

which features numbers by John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, and Lester Young, 

and also guest appearances by the tenor saxophonist and clarinetist Buddy 

Tate and the trumpeters Lester Bowie and Harry "Sweets"Edison, among 

others, casts Carter in a reverential role to which he doesn't seem very 

well suited. <P>



Joshua Redman was another of the festival's headliners. I thought I sensed 

an element of rivalry between him and Carter even before hearing them go 

head to head on the soundtrack of Robert Altman's <I>Kansas City</I> 

(Verve 314 529 554-2) and reading an article on Carter in <I>New York</I>, 

in which he boasted of having taken Redman's measure in a bandstand 

showdown (and of having caught the eye of Redman's girlfriend). With 

Carter stealing some of his ink, Redman seems to be favoring a broader 

style of playing than he did just a few years ago. He, too, risks 

overdoing a few pet devices, the most annoying of which is the comic 

upper-register burp that he uses to end far too many of his lines--to 

the apparent delight of audiences. <P>



On <I>Spirit of the Moment</I>, which was recorded last March, Redman 

sounds much as he did in Montreal.  The average new jazz CD is too long: 

though consumers seem to like the idea of an hour or more of music at a 

pop, the playing time practically ensures inconsistency--especially on the 

part of younger performers who haven't yet learned to pace themselves.  

<I>Spirit of the Moment</I>'s two discs clock in at almost two and a half 

hours, and this is more than enough time to showcase Redman's obvious 

gifts.  The most notable of these might be his admirable sense of up-tempo 

melodic continuity ("Slapstick" is the best of several examples), his 

success at forming a band in his own image (the drummer Brian Blade is 

especially tuned in to him), and his increasing maturity as a balladeer.  

Such a generous helping of Redman also serves to expose the derivative 

nature of many of his solos.  His debt to Sonny Rollins is plain on Jule 

Styne's "Just in Time," from <I>Bells Are Ringing</I>.  When Rollins 

recorded the song, he was having fun with a show tune; Redman is playing 

Rollins, and setting the bar far too high for either him or us to have much 

fun.  Critics used to chide Branford Marsalis for mimicking a different 

tenor player on every number.  His Zelig-like approach is now standard 

among younger players.  Oddly enough, it's on <I>Spirit of the Moment</I>'s 

most Coltrane-influenced performance--"Dialogue," a modal folksong-like 

dirge similar to Coltrane's "Alabama"--that Redman gives promise of finding 

his own voice, in his elegant and suspenseful shadow play with the rhythm 

section.  <P>



"Dialogue" first appeared on Redman's 1994 studio album <I>MoodSwing</I>, 

which also featured a tune called "Chill," a syncopated finger-snapper that 

drew a cheer of recognition from Redman's audience in Montreal.  "Chill" is 

a cleverly constructed tune, funky and relaxed, much like something Horace 

Silver or Bobby Timmons might have written in the early 1960s, but with a 

bridge that goes all the way back to Lionel Hampton's swing-era anthem 

"Flying Home." On first hearing "Chill," I thought the bridge was the reason that 

Redman's melody struck me as so familiar, but in Montreal, I realized how 

similar the tune's cadences are to those of an obscure pop song I doubt 

Redman has ever heard.<P>



<BR>



<font size=5>T</font>HAT song is Andr&eacute; Previn and Paul Francis 

Webster's "Like Young," a track from Perry Como's 1961 album <I>Young at 

Heart</I> which resurfaced a few years ago on Rhino/Word Beat's <I>The Beat 

Generation</I>, a likably goofy multi-disc set aimed at people whose 

serious interest in Allen Ginsberg and <I>On the Road</I> doesn't preclude 

an affection for Maynard G.  Krebs and <I>Route 66</I>.  Webster's lyrics 

have the clueless, middle-aged Como flipping for a girl who "goes where all 

the angry young men go," "recites poetry," and "drinks coffee with 

caf&eacute; espresso." She's got Como feeling "like young," but he's really 

just showing his age.  <P>



Jazz is showing its age too, or else why would there now be such a 

preoccupation with youth?  Charlie Parker was twenty-five when he recorded 

"Ko Ko" and "Now's the Time"; he was dead at thirty-four, Wynton Marsalis's 

age now.  Ornette Coleman was twenty-nine and not considered especially 

young when he caught the world by surprise with <I>The Shape of Jazz to 

Come</I>, in 1959.  There have always been young jazz musicians, but only 

lately has anyone made a fuss over them just for <I>being</I> 

young--instead of for auguring change.  <P>



Are more young people listening to jazz because they can identify with 

Redman and the others? From what I've noticed, the answer is yes only if 

you count as "young" dating couples in their late twenties and early 

thirties. I've been to shows where the youngest people in the house were 

on the bandstand. In allowing itself to become so strongly identified with 

its past, jazz may be bargaining away its future. Positioning jazz as a 

sane acoustic alternative to raucous, mechanized pop might be an effective 

short-term sales strategy, but doesn't all this sanctimony about 

"tradition" and the emphasis on boilerplate bebop send a message to 

teenagers and college students that jazz offers absolutely nothing of 

interest to them? And isn't whatever the form of music that rings 

someone's bells at eighteen or nineteen likely to remain his or her music 

of choice for life? <P>



Something else to worry about is what happens if today's whiz kids fail to 

sell albums in numbers sufficient to justify the generous advances that 

record companies are giving them (Jacky Terrasson, for example, is rumored 

to have signed with Blue Note for $100,000). The majors are likely to take 

this as evidence that jazz just doesn't sell. It wouldn't be the first 

time they've arrived at this conclusion and then turned it into a 

self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>

		</font>n the late 1980s public-television stations aired a talking-heads series 
called <I><A HREF="http://www.learner.org/hv_catalog/hv_psych/hvea_page">Ethics in America</A></I>. For each show more than a dozen prominent 
citizens sat around a horseshoe-shaped table and tried to answer troubling 
ethical questions posed by a moderator. The <A HREF="http://www.learner.org/ed_catalog/ed_psych/edea_prog">series</A> might have seemed a 
good bet to be paralyzingly dull, but at least one show was riveting in 
its drama and tension.<P>
The episode was taped in the fall of 1987. Its title was "Under Orders, 
Under Fire," and most of the panelists were former soldiers talking about 
the ethical dilemmas of their work. The moderator was Charles Ogletree, a 
professor at Harvard Law School, who moved from panelist to panelist 
asking increasingly difficult questions in the law school's famous 
Socratic style. <p>
		
		
										<!--SEAHORSE ICON FOR RELATED ARTICLES-->

	</A>
	
										
	
	During the first half of the show Ogletree made the soldiers squirm about 
ethical tangles on the battlefield. The man getting the roughest treatment 
was Frederick Downs, a writer who as a young Army lieutenant in Vietnam 
had lost his left arm in a mine explosion.<P>
Ogletree asked Downs to imagine that he was a young lieutenant again. He 
and his platoon were in the nation of "South Kosan," advising South 
Kosanese troops in their struggle against invaders from "North Kosan." 
(This scenario was apparently a hybrid of the U.S. roles in the Korean and 
Vietnam wars.) A North Kosanese unit had captured several of Downs's men 
alive--but Downs had also captured several of the North Kosanese. 
Downs did not know where his men were being held, but he thought his 
prisoners did.<P>
And so Ogletree put the question: How far would Downs go to make a 
prisoner talk? Would he order him tortured? Would he torture the prisoner 
himself? Downs himself speculated on what he would do if he had a big 
knife in his hand. Would he start cutting the prisoner? When would he make 
himself stop, if the prisoner just wouldn't talk?<P>

<A HREF="./mouthb.htm"><IMG SRC="./mouth.gif" ALT=" " ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="207" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10"></A>

Downs did not shrink from the questions or the implications of his 
answers. He wouldn't enjoy doing it, he told Ogletree. He would have to 
live with the consequences for the rest of his life. But yes, he would 
torture the captive. He would use the knife. Implicit in his answers was 
the idea that he would do the cutting himself and would listen to the 
captive scream. He would do whatever was necessary to try to save his own 
men. While explaining his decisions Downs sometimes gestured with his left 
hand for emphasis. The hand was a metal hook.<P>
Ogletree worked his way through the other military officials, asking all 
how they reacted to Frederick Downs's choice.  <A HREF="http://www.ddg.com/LIS/hegemier/WWW.html#WESTMORELAND">William Westmoreland,</A> who 
had commanded the whole U.S. force in Vietnam when Downs was serving 
there, deplored Downs's decision. After all, he said, even war has its 
rules. An Army chaplain wrestled with how he would react if a soldier in a 
morally troubling position similar to Downs's came to him privately and 
confessed what he had done. A Marine Corps officer juggled a related 
question: What would he do if he came across an American soldier who was 
about to torture or execute a bound and unarmed prisoner, who might be a 
civilian?<P>
The soldiers disagreed among themselves. Yet in describing their decisions 
they used phrases like "I hope I would have the courage to . . ." and "In 
order to live with myself later I would . . ." The whole exercise may have 
been set up as a rhetorical game, but Ogletree's questions clearly tapped 
into discussions the soldiers had already had about the consequences of 
choices they made.<P>
Then Ogletree turned to the two most famous members of the evening's 
panel, better known even than Westmoreland. These were two star TV 
journalists: Peter Jennings, of
 <I><A HREF="http://abcradio.ccabc.com/wnt.htm">World News Tonight</A></I> and ABC, and 
<A HREF="http://www.csubak.edu/business_conference/speakers/SPEAKERS6.HTML">Mike Wallace,</A> of <I>60 Minutes</I> and CBS.<P>
Ogletree brought them into the same hypothetical war. He asked Jennings to 
imagine that he worked for a network that had been in contact with the 
enemy North Kosanese government. After much pleading Jennings and his news 
crew got permission from the North Kosanese to enter their country and 
film behind the lines. Would Jennings be willing to go? Of course, he 
replied. Any reporter would--and in real wars reporters from his 
network often had.<P>
But while Jennings and his crew were traveling with a North Kosanese unit, 
to visit the site of an alleged atrocity by U.S. and South Kosanese 
troops, they unexpectedly crossed the trail of a small group of American 
and South Kosanese soldiers. With Jennings in their midst the Northern 
soldiers set up an ambush that would let them gun down the Americans and 
Southerners. <P>
What would Jennings do? Would he tell his cameramen to "Roll tape!" as the 
North Kosanese opened fire? What would go through his mind as he watched 
the North Kosanese prepare to fire?<P>
Jennings sat silent for about fifteen seconds. "Well, I guess I wouldn't," 
he finally said. "I am going to tell you now what I am feeling, rather 
than the hypothesis I drew for myself. If I were with a North Kosanese 
unit that came upon Americans, I think that I personally would do what I 
could to warn the Americans."<P>
Even if it meant losing the story? Ogletree asked. <P>
Even though it would almost certainly mean losing my life, Jennings 
replied. "But I do not think that I could bring myself to participate in 
that act. That's purely personal, and other reporters might have a 
different reaction."<P>
Ogletree turned for reaction to Mike Wallace, who immediately replied. "I 
think some other reporters <I>would </I>have a different reaction," he 
said, obviously referring to himself. "They would regard it simply as 
another story they were there to cover." A moment later Wallace said, "I 
am astonished, really." He turned toward Jennings and began to lecture 
him: "You're a <I>reporter</I>. Granted you're an American" (at least for 
purposes of the fictional example; Jennings has actually retained Canadian 
citizenship). "I'm a little bit at a loss to understand why, because 
you're an American, you would not have covered that story."<P>
Ogletree pushed Wallace. Didn't Jennings have some higher duty to do 
something other than just roll film as soldiers from his own country were 
being shot?<P>
"No," Wallace said flatly and immediately. "You don't have a higher duty. 
No. No. You're a reporter!"<P>
Jennings backtracked fast. Wallace was right, he said: "I chickened out." 
Jennings said that he had "played the hypothetical very hard."He had lost 
sight of his journalistic duty to remain detached.<P>
As Jennings said he agreed with Wallace, several soldiers in the room 
seemed to regard the two of them with horror. Retired Air Force General 
<A HREF="http://www.nd.edu/~aleyden/scowcroft.html">Brent Scowcroft,</A> who would soon become George Bush's National Security 
Advisor, said it was simply wrong to stand and watch as your side was 
slaughtered. "What's it <I>worth</I>?" he asked Wallace bitterly. "It's 
worth thirty seconds on the evening news, as opposed to saving a 
platoon."<P>
After a brief discussion between Wallace and Scowcroft, Ogletree reminded 
Wallace of Scowcroft's basic question. What was it worth for the reporter 
to stand by, looking? Shouldn't the reporter have said <I>something</I> ?<P>
Wallace gave a disarming grin, shrugged his shoulders, and said, "I don't 
know." He later mentioned extreme circumstances in which he thought 
journalists should intervene. But at that moment he seemed to be mugging 
to the crowd with a "Don't ask me!"expression, and in fact he drew a big 
laugh--the first such moment in the discussion. Jennings, however, was 
all business, and was still concerned about the first answer he had 
given.<P>
"I wish I had made another decision," Jennings said, as if asking 
permission to live the past five minutes over again. "I would like to have 
made his decision"--that is, Wallace's decision to keep on filming.<P>
A few minutes later Ogletree turned to George M. Connell, a Marine colonel 
in full uniform. Jaw muscles flexing in anger, with stress on each word, 
Connell said, "I feel utter contempt."<P>
Two days after this hypothetical episode, Connell said, Jennings or 
Wallace might be back with the American forces--and could be wounded 
by stray fire, as combat journalists often had been before. When that 
happens, he said, they are "just journalists." Yet they would expect 
American soldiers to run out under enemy fire and drag them back, rather 
than leaving them to bleed to death on the battlefield.<P>
"I'll do it!" Connell said. "And that is what makes me so contemptuous of 
them. Marines will die going to get . . . a couple of journalists." The 
last words dripped disgust. <P>
Not even Ogletree knew what to say. There was dead silence for several 
seconds. Then a square-jawed man with neat gray hair and aviator glasses 
spoke up. It was <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">Newt Gingrich,</A> looking a generation younger and trimmer 
than he would when he became speaker of the House, in 1995. One thing was 
clear from this exercise, Gingrich said. "The military has done a vastly 
better job of systematically thinking through the ethics of behavior in a 
violent environment than the journalists have."<P>
That was about the mildest way to put it. Although Wallace and Jennings 
conceded that the criticism was fair--if journalists considered 
themselves "detached,"they could not logically expect American soldiers to 
rescue them--nevertheless their reactions spoke volumes about the 
values of their craft. Jennings was made to feel embarrassed about his 
natural, decent human impulse. Wallace seemed unembarrassed about feeling 
no connection to the soldiers in his country's army or considering their 
deaths before his eyes "simply a story." In other important occupations 
people sometimes face the need to do the horrible. Frederick Downs, after 
all, was willing to torture a man and hear him scream. But Downs had 
thought through all the consequences and alternatives, and he knew he 
would live with the horror for the rest of his days. When Mike Wallace 
said he would do something horrible, he barely bothered to give a 
rationale. He did not try to explain the reasons a reporter might feel 
obliged to remain silent as the attack began--for instance, that in 
combat reporters must be beyond country, or that they have a duty to bear 
impartial witness to deaths on either side, or that Jennings had 
implicitly made a promise not to betray the North Kosanese when he agreed 
to accompany them. The soldiers might or might not have found such 
arguments convincing; Wallace didn't even make them. <P>
<CENTER><b>NOT ISSUES BUT THE <br>
GAME OF POLITICS</b><P>
</CENTER> 
<font size=5>A</font> generation ago political talk programs were sleepy Sunday-morning affairs. The Secretary of State or the Senate majority leader would show up to answer 
questions from Lawrence Spivak or Bob Clark, and after thirty minutes 
another stately episode of <I><A HREF="http://www.nbc.com/news/shows/meetpress/index.html">Meet the Press</A> </I >or <I>Issues and Answers 
</I> would be history.<P>
Everything in public life is "brighter" and more "interesting" now. 
Constant competition from the weekday trash-talk shows has forced anything 
involving political life to liven up. Under pressure from the Saturday 
political-talk shows--<I>The McLaughlin Group </I>and its many 
disorderly descendants--even the Sunday-morning shows have put on 
rouge and push-up bras.<P>
<I>Meet the Press</I>, moderated by Tim Russert, is probably the meatiest 
of these programs. High-powered guests discuss serious topics with 
Russert, who worked for years in politics, and with veteran reporters. Yet 
the pressure to keep things lively means that squabbling replaces 
dialogue. <P>
The discussion shows that are supposed to enhance public understanding may 
actually reduce it, by hammering home the message that issues don't matter 
except as items for politicians to fight over. Some politicians in 
Washington may indeed view all issues as mere tools to use against their 
opponents. But far from offsetting this view of public life, the national 
press often encourages it. As Washington-based talk shows have become more 
popular in the past decade, they have had a trickle-down effect in cities 
across the country. In Seattle, in Los Angeles, in Boston, in Atlanta, 
journalists gain notice and influence by appearing regularly on talk 
shows--and during those appearances they mainly talk about the game of 
politics.<P>
In the 1992 presidential campaign candidates spent more time answering 
questions from "ordinary people"--citizens in town-hall forums, 
callers on radio and TV talk shows--than they had in previous years. 
The citizens asked overwhelmingly about the <I>what </I>of politics: What 
are you going to do about the health-care system? What can you do to 
reduce the cost of welfare? The reporters asked almost exclusively about 
the <I>how</I>: How are you going to try to take away Perot's 
constituency? How do you answer charges that you have flip-flopped?<P>
After the 1992 campaign the contrast between questions from citizens and 
those from reporters was widely discussed in journalism reviews and 
postmortems on campaign coverage. Reporters acknowledged that they should 
try harder to ask questions about things their readers and viewers seemed 
to care about--that is, questions about the differences that political 
choices would make in people's lives. <P>
In January of last year there was a chance to see how well the lesson had 
sunk in. In the days just before and after Bill Clinton delivered his 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.umbc.edu/~jkent/1995-01-24-state-of-union.html">State of the Union address</A> to the new Republican-controlled Congress, he 
answered questions in a wide variety of forums in order to explain his 
plans. <P>

On January 31, a week after the speech, the President flew to Boston and 
took questions from a group of teenagers. Their questions concerned the 
effects of legislation or government programs on their communities or 
schools. These were the questions (paraphrased in some cases):<P>
&#128; "We need stronger laws to punish those people who are caught 
selling guns to our youth. Basically, what can you do about that?"<P>
&#128; "I notice that often it's the media that is responsible for the 
negative portrayal of young people in our society." What can political 
leaders do to persuade the media that there is good news about youth?<P>
&#128; Apprenticeship programs and other ways to provide job training have 
been valuable for students not going to college. Can the Administration 
promote more of these programs?<P>
&#128; Programs designed to keep teenagers away from drugs and gangs often 
emphasize sports and seem geared mainly to boys. How can such programs be 
made more attractive to teenage girls?<P>
&#128; What is it like at Oxford? (This was from a student who was 
completing a new alternative-school curriculum in 
the Boston public schools, and who had been accepted at Oxford.)<P>
&#128; "We need more police officers who are trained to deal with all the 
other different cultures in our cities." What can the government do about 
that?<P>
&#128; "In Boston, Northeastern University has created a model of 
scholarships and other supports to help inner-city kids get to and stay in 
college. . . . As President, can you urge colleges across the country to 
do what Northeastern has done?"<P>
Earlier in the month the President's performance had been assessed by the 
three network-news anchors: Peter Jennings, of ABC; Dan Rather, of CBS; 
and <A HREF="http://www.nbc.com/news/shows/nightlynews/biobrokaw.html">Tom Brokaw,</A> of NBC. There was no overlap whatsoever between the 
questions the students asked and those raised by the anchors. None of the 
questions from these news professionals concerned the impact of 
legislation or politics on people's lives. Nearly all concerned the 
struggle for individual advancement among candidates.<P>
Peter Jennings, who met with Clinton as the Gingrich-Dole Congress was 
getting under way, asked whether Clinton had been eclipsed as a political 
leader by the Republicans. Dan Rather did interviews through January with 
prominent politicians--Senators Edward Kennedy, Phil Gramm, and Bob 
Dole--building up to a profile of Clinton two days after the State of 
the Union address. Every question he asked was about popularity or 
political tactics. He asked Phil Gramm to guess whether Newt Gingrich 
would enter the race (no) and whether Bill Clinton would be renominated by 
his party (yes). He asked Bob Dole what kind of mood the President seemed 
to be in, and whether Dole and Gingrich were, in effect, the new bosses of 
Washington. When Edward Kennedy began giving his views about the 
<A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/comm/jec/general/bba120.html">balanced-budget amendment,</A> Rather steered him back on course: "Senator, 
you know I'd talk about these things the rest of the afternoon, but let's 
move quickly to politics. Do you expect Bill Clinton to be the Democratic 
nominee for re-election in 1996?"<P>
The <I>CBS Evening News </I>profile of Clinton, which was narrated by 
Rather and was presented as part of the series <I>Eye on America</I>, 
contained no mention of Clinton's economic policy, his tax or budget 
plans, his failed attempt to pass a health-care proposal, his successful 
attempt to ratify NAFTA, his efforts to "reinvent government," or any 
substantive aspect of his proposals or plans in office. Its subject was 
exclusively Clinton's handling of his office--his "difficulty making 
decisions," his "waffling" at crucial moments. If Rather or his colleagues 
had any interest in the content of Clinton's speech as opposed to its 
political effect, neither the questions they asked nor the reports they 
aired revealed such a concern.<P>
<A HREF="http://speakers.com/spkr1006.html">Tom Brokaw's</A> questions were more substantive, but even he concentrated 
mainly on politics of the moment. How did the President feel about a poll 
showing that 61 percent of the public felt that he had no "strong 
convictions" and could be "easily swayed"? What did Bill Clinton think 
about Newt Gingrich? "Do you think he plays fair?" How did he like it that 
people kept shooting at the White House?<P>
When ordinary citizens have a chance to pose questions to political 
leaders, they rarely ask about the game of politics. They want to know how 
the reality of politics will affect them--through taxes, programs, 
scholarship funds, wars. Journalists justify their intrusiveness and 
excesses by claiming that they are the public's representatives, asking 
the questions their fellow citizens would ask if they had the privilege of 
meeting with Presidents and senators. In fact they ask questions that only 
their fellow political professionals care about. And they often do 
so--as at the typical White House news conference--with a 
discourtesy and rancor that represent the public's views much less than 
they reflect the modern journalist's belief that being independent boils 
down to acting hostile.<P>
<CENTER><B>REDUCTIO AD ELECTIONEM: <br>
THE ONE-TRACK MIND</b><P>
</CENTER>
<font size=5>T</font>he limited curiosity that elite reporters display in their 
questions is also evident in the stories they write once they have 
received answers. They are interested mainly in pure politics and can be 
coerced into examining the substance of an issue only as a last resort. 
The subtle but sure result is a stream of daily messages that the real 
meaning of public life is the struggle of Bob Dole against Newt Gingrich 
against Bill Clinton, rather than our collective efforts to solve 
collective problems. <P>
The natural instinct of newspapers and TV is to present every public issue 
as if its "real" meaning were political in the meanest and narrowest sense 
of that term--the attempt by parties and candidates to gain an 
advantage over their rivals. Reporters do, of course, write stories about 
political life in the broader sense and about the substance of 
issues--the pluses and minuses of diplomatic recognition for Vietnam, 
the difficulties of holding down the Medicare budget, whether immigrants 
help or hurt the nation's economic base. But when there is a chance to use 
these issues as props or raw material for a story about political tactics, 
most reporters leap at it. It is more fun--and easier--to write 
about Bill Clinton's "positioning" on the Vietnam issue, or how Newt 
Gingrich is "handling" the need to cut Medicare, than it is to look into 
the issues themselves.<P>
Examples of this preference occur so often that they're difficult to 
notice. But every morning's newspaper, along with every evening's 
newscast, reveals this pattern of thought.<P>
&#128; Last February, when the Democratic President and the Republican 
Congress were fighting over how much federal money would go to local 
law-enforcement agencies, one network-news broadcast showed a clip of 
Gingrich denouncing Clinton and another of Clinton standing in front of a 
sea of uniformed police officers while making a tough-on-crime speech. The 
correspondent's sign-off line was "The White House thinks 'cops on the 
beat' has a simple but appealing ring to it." That is, the President was 
pushing the plan because it would sound good in his campaign ads. Whether 
or not that was Clinton's real motive, nothing in the broadcast gave the 
slightest hint of where the extra policemen would go, how much they might 
cost, whether there was reason to think they'd do any good. Everything in 
the story suggested that the crime bill mattered only as a chapter in the 
real saga, which was the struggle between Bill and Newt.<P>
&#128; Last April, after the explosion at the federal building in Oklahoma 
City, discussion changed quickly from the event itself to politicians' 
"handling" of the event. On the Sunday after the blast President Clinton 
announced a series of new anti-terrorism measures. The next morning, on 
National Public Radio's <I><A HREF="http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/">Morning Edition</A></I>, Cokie Roberts was asked 
about the prospects of the proposals' taking effect. "In some ways it's 
not even the point," she replied. What mattered was that Clinton "looked 
good" taking the tough side of the issue. No one expects Cokie Roberts or 
other political correspondents to be experts on controlling terrorism, 
negotiating with the Syrians, or the other specific measures on which 
Presidents make stands. But all issues are shoehorned into the area of 
expertise the most-prominent correspondents do have:the struggle for 
one-upmanship among a handful of political leaders.<P>
&#128; When health-care reform was the focus of big political battles 
between Republicans and Democrats, it was on the front page and the 
evening newscast every day. When the Clinton Administration declared 
defeat in 1994 and there were no more battles to be fought, health-care 
news coverage virtually stopped too--even though the medical system 
still represented one seventh of the economy, even though HMOs and 
corporations and hospitals and pharmaceutical companies were rapidly 
changing policies in the face of ever-rising costs. Health care was no 
longer political news, and therefore it was no longer interesting news.<P>
&#128; After California's voters approved <A HREF="http://www.usc.edu/Library/Ref/Ethnic/prop187.txt">Proposition 187</A> in the 1994 
elections, drastically limiting the benefits available to illegal 
immigrants, the national press ran a trickle of stories on what this would 
mean for California's economy, its school and legal systems, even its 
relations with Mexico. A flood of stories examined the political impact of 
the immigration issue--how the Republicans might exploit it, how the 
Democrats might be divided by it, whether it might propel Pete Wilson to 
the White House.<P>
&#128; On August 16 last year <A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/~bradley/">Bill Bradley</A> announced that after 
representing New Jersey in the Senate for three terms he would not run for 
a fourth term. In interviews and at the news conferences he conducted 
afterward Bradley did his best to talk about the deep problems of public 
life and economic adjustment that had left him frustrated with the 
political process. Each of the parties had locked itself into rigid 
positions that kept it from dealing with the realistic concerns of 
ordinary people, he said. American corporations were doing what they had 
to do for survival in international competition: they were downsizing and 
making themselves radically more efficient and productive. But the result 
was to leave "decent, hardworking Americans" more vulnerable to layoffs 
and the loss of their careers, medical coverage, pension rights, and 
social standing than they had been in decades. Somehow, Bradley said, we 
had to move past the focus on short-term political maneuvering and 
determine how to deal with the forces that were leaving Americans 
frustrated and insecure.<P>
That, at least, was what Bill Bradley said. What turned up in the press 
was almost exclusively speculation about what the move meant for this 
year's presidential race and the party lineup on Capitol Hill. Might 
Bradley challenge Bill Clinton in the Democratic primaries? If not, was he 
preparing for an independent run? Could the Democrats come up with any 
other candidate capable of holding on to Bradley's seat? Wasn't this a 
slap in the face for Bill Clinton and the party he purported to lead? In 
the aftermath of Bradley's announcement prominent TV and newspaper 
reporters competed to come up with the shrewdest analysis of the political 
impact of the move. None of the country's major papers or networks used 
Bradley's announcement as a news peg for an analysis of the real issues he 
had raised.<P>
The day after his announcement Bradley was interviewed by <A HREF="http://freenet.vcu.edu/civic/organ/richmond-forum/woodruff">Judy Woodruff</A> on 
the CNN program <I>Inside Politics</I>. Woodruff is a widely respected and 
knowledgeable reporter, but her interaction with Bradley was like the 
meeting of two beings from different universes. Every answer Bradley gave 
was about the substance of national problems that concerned him. Every one 
of Woodruff's responses or questions was about short-term political 
tactics. Woodruff asked about the political implications of his move for 
Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich. Bradley replied that it was more important 
to concentrate on the difficulties both parties had in dealing with real 
national problems. <P>
Midway through the interview Bradley gave a long answer to the effect that 
everyone involved in politics had to get out of the rut of converting 
every subject or comment into a political "issue," used for partisan 
advantage. Let's stop talking, Bradley said, about who will win what race 
and start responding to one another's ideas.<P>
As soon as he finished, Woodruff asked her next question: "Do you want to 
be President?" It was as if she had not heard a word he had been 
saying--or <I>couldn't </I>hear it, because the media's language of 
political analysis is utterly separate from the terms in which people 
describe real problems in their lives.<P>
The effect is as if the discussion of every new advance in medicine boiled 
down to speculation about whether its creator would win the Nobel Prize 
that year. Regardless of the tone of coverage, medical research will go 
on. But a relentless emphasis on the cynical game of politics threatens 
public life itself, by implying day after day that the political sphere is 
nothing more than an arena in which ambitious politicians struggle for 
dominance, rather than a structure in which citizens can deal with 
worrisome collective problems. <P>

<CENTER><b>POINTLESS PREDICTION: <br>
THE POLITICAL EXPERTS</b><P>
</CENTER>
 <font size=5>O</font>n Sunday, November 6, 1994, two days before the congressional 
elections that swept the Republicans to power, <I>The Washington Post 
</I>published the results of its "Crystal Ball" poll. Fourteen prominent 
journalists, pollsters, and all-around analysts made their predictions 
about how many seats each party would win in the House and Senate and how 
many governorships each would take.<P>
One week later many of these same experts would be saying on their talk 
shows that the Republican landslide was "inevitable" and "a long time 
coming" and "a sign of deep discontent in the heartland." But before the 
returns were in, how many of the fourteen experts predicted that the 
Republicans would win both houses of Congress and that Newt Gingrich would 
be speaker? Exactly three.<P>
What is interesting about this event is not just that so many experts 
could be so wrong. Immediately after the election even Newt Gingrich 
seemed dazed by the idea that the forty-year reign of the Democrats in the 
House had actually come to an end. Rather, the episode said something 
about the futility of political prediction itself--a task to which the 
big-time press devotes enormous effort and time. <I>Two days </I>before 
the election many of the country's most admired analysts had no idea what 
was about to happen. Yet within a matter of weeks these same people, 
unfazed, would be writing articles and giving speeches and being quoted 
about who was "ahead" and "behind" in the emerging race for the White 
House in 1996. <P>
As with medieval doctors who applied leeches and trepanned skulls, the 
practitioners cannot be blamed for the limits of their profession. But we 
can ask why reporters spend so much time directing our attention toward 
what is not much more than guesswork on their part. It builds the 
impression that journalism is about what's entertaining--guessing what 
might or might not happen next month--rather than what's useful, such 
as extracting lessons of success and failure from events that have already 
occurred. Competing predictions add almost nothing to our ability to solve 
public problems or to make sensible choices among complex alternatives. 
Yet such useless distractions have become a specialty of the political 
press. They are easy to produce, they allow reporters to act as if they 
possessed special inside knowledge, and there are no consequences for 
being wrong.<P>
<CENTER><b>SPOON-FEEDING: THE WHITE <br>
HOUSE PRESS CORPS</b><P>
</CENTER><font size=5>I</font>n the early spring of last year, when Newt Gingrich was 
dominating the news from Washington and the O. J. Simpson trial was 
dominating the news as a whole, <I>The Washington Post </I>ran an article 
about the pathos of the White House press room. Nobody wanted to hear what 
the President was doing, so the people who cover the President could not 
get on the air. Howard Kurtz, the <I>Post</I>'s media writer, described 
the human cost of this political change:<P>

<blockquote>
Brit Hume is in his closet-size White House cubicle, watching Kato Kaelin 
testify on CNN. Bill Plante, in the adjoining cubicle, has his feet up and 
is buried in the <I>New York Times</I>. Brian Williams is in the corridor, 
idling away the time with Jim Miklaszewski.<P>
An announcement is made for a bill-signing ceremony. Some of America's 
highest-paid television correspondents begin ambling toward the pressroom 
door.<P>
"Are you coming with us?" Williams asks.<P>
"I guess so," says Hume, looking forlorn.<P>
The White House spokesman, Mike McCurry, told Kurtz that there was some 
benefit to the enforced silence: "Brit Hume has now got his crossword 
puzzle capacity down to record time. And some of the reporters have been 
out on the lecture circuit."<P>
</blockquote>

The deadpan restraint with which Kurtz told this story is admirable. But 
the question many readers would want to scream at the idle correspondents 
is <I>Why don't you go out and do some work? </I><P>
Why not go out and interview someone, even if you're not going to get any 
airtime that night? Why not escape the monotonous tyranny of the White 
House press room, which reporters are always complaining about? The 
knowledge that O.J. will keep you off the air yet again should liberate 
you to look into those stories you never "had time" to deal with before. 
Why not <I>read a book</I>--about welfare reform, about Russia or 
China, about race relations, about anything? Why not imagine, just for a 
moment, that your journalistic duty might involve something more varied 
and constructive than doing standups from the White House lawn and 
sounding skeptical about whatever announcement the President's spokesman 
put out that day?<P>

<IMG SRC="./radio.gif" ALT=" " ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="218" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10">

What might these well-paid, well-trained correspondents have done while 
waiting for the O.J. trial to become boring enough that they could get 
back on the air? They might have tried to learn something that would be of 
use to their viewers when the story of the moment went away. Without 
leaving Washington, without going farther than ten minutes by taxi from 
the White House (so that they could be on hand if a sudden press 
conference was called), they could have prepared themselves to discuss the 
substance of issues that affect the public.<P>
For example, two years earlier Vice President Al Gore had announced an 
ambitious plan to "reinvent" the federal government. Had it made any 
difference, either in improving the performance of government or in 
reducing its cost, or was it all for show? Republicans and Democrats were 
sure to spend the next few months fighting about cuts in the capital-gains 
tax. Capital-gains tax rates were higher in some countries and lower in 
others. What did the experience of these countries show about whether 
cutting the rates helped an economy to grow? The rate of immigration was 
rising again, and in California and Florida it was becoming an important 
political issue. What was the latest evidence on the economic and social 
effects of immigration? Should Americans feel confident or threatened that 
so many foreigners were trying to make their way in? Soon both political 
parties would be advancing plans to reform the welfare system. Within a 
two-mile radius of the White House lived plenty of families on welfare. 
Why not go and see how the system had affected them, and what they would 
do if it changed? The federal government had gone further than most 
private industries in trying to open opportunities to racial minorities 
and women. The Pentagon had gone furthest of all. What did people involved 
in this process--men and women, blacks and whites--think about its 
successes and failures? What light did their experience shed on the 
impending affirmative-action debate?<P>
The list could go on for pages. With a few minutes' effort--about as 
long as it takes to do a crossword puzzle--the correspondents could 
have drawn up lists of other subjects they had never before "had time" to 
investigate. They had the time now. What they lacked was a sense that 
their responsibility involved something more than standing up to rehash 
the day's announcements when there was room for them on the news.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><b>GLASS HOUSES: <br>
JOURNALISTS AND FINANCIAL <br>DISCLOSURE</b> <P>

</CENTER><font size=5>H</font>alf a century ago reporters knew but didn't say that Franklin D. 
Roosevelt was in a wheelchair. A generation ago many reporters knew but 
didn't write about John F. Kennedy's insatiable appetite for women. For 
several months in the early Clinton era reporters knew about but didn't 
disclose Paula Jones's allegation that, as governor of Arkansas, Bill 
Clinton had exposed himself to her. Eventually this claim found its way 
into all the major newspapers, proving that there is no longer any such 
thing as an accusation too embarrassing to be printed if it seems to bear 
on a politician's "character." <P>
It is not just the President who has given up his privacy in the name of 
the public's right to know. Over the past two decades officials whose 
power is tiny compared with the President's have had to reveal 
embarrassing details about what most Americans consider very private 
matters: their income and wealth. Each of the more than 3,000 people 
appointed by the President to executive-branch jobs must reveal previous 
sources of income and summarize his or her financial holdings. Congressmen 
have changed their rules to forbid themselves to accept honoraria for 
speaking to interest groups or lobbyists. The money that politicians do 
raise from individuals and groups must be disclosed to the <A HREF="http://www.nicar.org/data/fec/">Federal 
Election Commission.</A> The information they disclose is available to the 
public and appears often in publications, most prominently <I>The 
Washington Post</I>.<P>
No one contends that every contribution makes every politician corrupt. 
But financial disclosure has become commonplace on the "Better safe than 
sorry" principle. If politicians and officials are not corrupt, the 
reasoning goes, they have nothing to fear from letting their finances be 
publicized. And if they are corrupt, public disclosure is a way to stop 
them before they do too much harm. The process may be embarrassing, but 
this is the cost of public life.<P>
How different the "Better safe than sorry" calculation seems when 
journalists are involved! Reporters and pundits hold no elected office, 
but they are obviously public figures. The most prominent TV-talk-show 
personalities are better known than all but a handful of congressmen. When 
politicians and pundits sit alongside one another on Washington talk shows 
and trade opinions, they underscore the essential similarity of their 
political roles. The pundits have no vote in Congress, but the overall 
political impact of a word from George Will, Ted Koppel, William Safire, 
or any of their colleagues who run the major editorial pages dwarfs 
anything a third-term congressman could do. If an interest group had the 
choice of buying the favor of one prominent media figure or of two junior 
congressmen, it wouldn't even have to think about the decision. The pundit 
is obviously more valuable. <P>
If a reporter is sued for libel by a prominent but unelected personality, 
such as <A HREF="http://www.cbs.com/lateshow/latestar.html">David Letterman</A> or Donald Trump, he or she says that the offended 
party is a "public figure"--about whom nearly anything can be written 
in the press. Public figures, according to the rulings that shape today's 
libel law, can win a libel suit only if they can prove that a reporter 
knew that what he or she was writing was false, or had "reckless 
disregard" for its truth, and went ahead and published it anyway. Public 
figures, according to the law, pay a price for being well known. And who 
are these people? The category is not limited to those who hold public 
office but includes all who "thrust themselves into the public eye." Most 
journalists would eloquently argue the logic of this broad definition of 
public figures--until the same standard was applied to them. <P>
In 1993 <A HREF="http://speakers.com/spkr1026.html">Sam Donaldson,</A> of ABC, described himself in an interview as being 
in touch with the concerns of the average American. "I'm trying to get a 
little ranching business started in New Mexico," he said. "I've got five 
people on the payroll. I'm making out those government forms." Thus he 
understood the travails of the small businessman and the annoyances of 
government regulation. Donaldson, whose base pay from ABC is reported to 
be some $2 million a year, did not point out that his several ranches in 
New Mexico together covered some 20,000 acres. When doing a segment 
attacking farm subsidies on <I>Prime Time Live </I>in 1993 he did not 
point out that "those government forms" allowed him to claim nearly 
$97,000 in sheep and mohair subsidies over two years. William Neuman, a 
reporter for the <I>New York Post</I>, said that when his photographer 
tried to take pictures of Donaldson's ranch house, Donaldson had him 
thrown off his property. ("In the West trespassing is a serious offense," 
Donaldson explained.)<P>
Had Donaldson as a journalist been pursuing a politician or even a 
corporate executive, he would have felt justified in using the most 
aggressive reportorial techniques. When these techniques were turned on 
him, he complained that the reporters were going too far. The analysts who 
are so clear-eyed about the conflict of interest in Newt Gingrich's book 
deal claim that they see no reason, none at all, why their own finances 
might be of public interest.<P>
Last May one of Donaldson's colleagues on <I>This Week With David 
Brinkley</I>, George Will, wrote a column and delivered on-air comments 
ridiculing the Clinton Administration's plan to impose tariffs on Japanese 
luxury cars, notably the Lexus. On the Brinkley show Will said that the 
tariffs would be "illegal" and would merely amount to "a subsidy for 
Mercedes dealerships." <P>
Neither in his column nor on the show did Will disclose that his wife, 
Mari Maseng Will, ran a firm that had been paid some $200,000 as a 
registered foreign agent for the Japan Automobile Manufacturers 
Association, and that one of the duties for which she was hired was to get 
American commentators to criticize the tariff plan. When Will was asked 
why he had never mentioned this, he replied that it was "just too silly" 
to think that his views might have been affected by his wife's 
contract.<P>
Will had, in fact, espoused such views for years, since long before his 
wife worked for the JAMA and even before he had married her. Few of his 
readers would leap to the conclusion that Will was serving as a mouthpiece 
for his wife's employers. But surely most would have preferred to learn 
that information from Will himself.<P>
A third member of the regular Brinkley panel, Cokie Roberts, is, along 
with Will and Donaldson, a frequent and highly paid speaker before 
corporate audiences. She has made a point of not disclosing which interest 
groups she speaks to or how much money she is paid. She has criticized the 
Clinton Administration for its secretive handling of the controversy 
surrounding Hillary Clinton's lucrative cattle-future trades and of the 
Whitewater affair, yet like the other pundits, she refuses to acknowledge 
that secrecy about financial interests undermines journalism's credibility 
too.<P>
<CENTER><b>OUT OF TOUCH WITH<br> AMERICA <P>
</b><P>
</CENTER><font size=5>I</font>n the week leading up to a State of the Union address White 
House aides always leak word to reporters that this year the speech will 
be "different." No more laundry list of all the government's activities, 
no more boring survey of every potential trouble spot in the world. This 
time, for a change, the speech is going to be short, punchy, and thematic. 
When the actual speech occurs, it is never short, punchy, or thematic. It 
is long and detailed, like all its predecessors, because as the deadline 
nears, every part of the government scrambles desperately to have a 
mention of its activities crammed into the speech somewhere.<P>
In the days before <A HREF="http://www.cs.umbc.edu/~jkent/1995-01-24-state-of-union.html">Bill Clinton's address a year ago</A> aides said that no 
matter what had happened to all those other Presidents, this time the 
speech really would be short, punchy, and thematic. The President 
understood the situation, he recognized his altered role, and he saw this 
as an opportunity to set a new theme for his third and fourth years in 
office.<P>
That evening the promises once again proved false. Bill Clinton gave a 
speech that was enormously long even by the standards of previous State of 
the Union addresses. The speech had three or four apparent endings, it had 
ad-libbed inserts, and it covered both the details of policy and the 
President's theories about what had gone wrong with America. An hour and 
twenty-one minutes after he took the podium, the President stepped down. 
<P>
Less than a minute later the mockery from commentators began. For instant 
analysis NBC went to <A HREF="http://www.rnc.org/news/tide/9511/article4.html">Peggy Noonan,</A> who had been a speechwriter for 
Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. She grimaced and barely tried to 
conceal her disdain for such an ungainly, sprawling speech. Other 
commentators soon mentioned that congressmen had been slipping out of the 
Capitol building before the end of the speech, that Clinton had once more 
failed to stick to an agenda, that the speech probably would not give the 
President the new start he sought. The comments were virtually all about 
the tactics of the speech, and they were almost all thumbs down.<P>
A day and a half later the first newspaper columns showed up. They were 
even more critical. On January 26 <I>The Washington Post</I>'s op-ed page 
consisted mainly of stories about the speech, all of which were withering. 
"All Mush and No Message" was the headline on a column by <A HREF="http://speakers.com/spkr1150.html">Richard Cohen</A>. 
"An Opportunity Missed" was the more statesmanlike judgment from <A HREF="http://speakers.com/spkr1178.html">David 
Broder.</A> Cohen wrote: "Pardon me if I thought of an awful metaphor: Clinton 
at a buffet table, eating everything in sight."<P>
What a big fat jerk that Clinton was! How little he understood the 
obligations of leadership! Yet the news section of the same day's <I>Post 
</I>had a long article based on discussions with a focus group of ordinary 
citizens in Chicago who had watched the President's speech. "For these 
voters, the State of the Union speech was an antidote to weeks of 
unrelenting criticism of Clinton's presidency," the article said.<P>
<blockquote>
"Tonight reminded us of what has been accomplished," said Maureen Prince, 
who works as the office manager in her husband's business and has raised 
five children. "We are so busy hearing the negatives all the time, from 
the time you wake up on your clock radio in the morning. . . ."<P>
The group's immediate impressions mirrored the results of several polls 
conducted immediately after the president's speech. <P>
ABC News found that eight out of 10 approved of the president's speech. 
CBS News said that 74 percent of those surveyed said they had a "clear 
idea" of what Clinton stands for, compared with just 41 percent before the 
speech. A <A HREF="http://www.gallup.com/newsletter/jan95/clinton_polls.html">Gallup Poll</A> for <I>USA Today </I>and Cable News Network found 
that eight in 10 said Clinton is leading the country in the right 
direction.<P></blockquote>

Nielsen ratings reported in the same day's paper showed that the longer 
the speech went on, the larger the number of people who tuned in to 
watch.<P>
The point is not that the pundits are necessarily wrong and the public 
necessarily right. The point is the gulf between the two groups' 
reactions. The very aspects of the speech that had seemed so ridiculous to 
the professional commentators--its detail, its inclusiveness, the 
hyperearnestness of Clinton's conclusion about the "common 
good"--seemed attractive and worthwhile to most viewers. <P>
"I'm wondering what so much of the public heard that our highly trained 
expert analysts completely missed," Carol Cantor, a software consultant 
from California, wrote in a discussion on the WELL, a popular online 
forum, three days after the speech. What they heard was, in fact, the 
speech, which allowed them to draw their own conclusions rather than being 
forced to accept an expert "analysis" of how the President "handled" the 
speech. In most cases the analysis goes unchallenged, because the public 
has no chance to see whatever event the pundits are describing. In this 
instance viewers had exactly the same evidence about Clinton's performance 
that the "experts" did, and from it they drew radically different 
conclusions. <P>
In 1992 political professionals had laughed at Ross Perot's "boring" and 
"complex" charts about the federal budget deficit--until it became 
obvious that viewers loved them. And for a week or two after this State of 
the Union speech there were little jokes on the weekend talk shows about 
how out of step the pundit reaction had been with opinion "out there." But 
after a polite chuckle the talk shifted to how the President and the 
speaker and Senator Dole were handling their jobs.<P>

<CENTER><b>TERM LIMITS</B><P>
</CENTER> <font size=5>A</font>s soon as the Democrats were routed in the 1994 elections, commentators 
and TV analysts said it was obvious that the American people were tired of seeing the same old 
faces in Washington. The argument went that those who lived inside the 
Beltway had forgotten what it was like in the rest of the country. They 
didn't get it. They were out of touch. The only way to jerk the 
congressional system back to reality was to bring in new blood.<P>
A few days after the new Congress was sworn in, CNN began running an 
updated series of promotional ads for its program <I>Crossfire</I>. 
(Previous ads had featured shots of locomotives colliding head-on and rams 
locking horns, to symbolize the meeting of minds on the show.) Everything 
has been shaken up in the capital, one of the ads began. New faces. New 
names. New people in charge of all the committees.<P>
"In fact," the announcer said, in a tone meant to indicate whimsy, "only 
one committee hasn't changed. The <I>welcoming </I>committee."<P>
The camera pulled back to reveal the three hosts of 
<I>Crossfire</I>--Pat Buchanan,
 <A HREF="http://www.nd.edu/~aleyden/sununu.html">John Sununu,</A> and <A HREF="http://www.csuchico.edu/econ/links/intel.lunch.html">Michael 
Kinsley</A>--standing with arms crossed on the steps of the Capitol 
building, blocking the path of the new arrivals trying to make their way 
in. "Watch your step," one of the hosts said.<P>
Talk about not getting it! The people who put together this ad must have 
imagined that the popular irritation with inside-the-Beltway culture was 
confined to members of Congress--and didn't extend to members of the 
punditocracy, many of whom had held their positions much longer than the 
typical congressman had. The difference between the "welcoming committee" 
and the congressional committees headed by fallen Democratic titans like 
Tom Foley and Jack Brooks was that the congressmen can be booted out.<P>
"Polls show that both Republicans <I>and </I>Democrats felt better about 
the Congress just after the 1994 elections," a Clinton Administration 
official said last year. "They had 'made the monkey jump'--they were 
able to discipline an institution they didn't like. They could register 
the fact that they were unhappy. There doesn't seem to be any way to do 
that with the press, except to stop watching and reading, which more and 
more people have done."<P>
<CENTER><b>LOST CREDIBILITY</b><P>
</CENTER><font size=5>T</font>here is an astonishing gulf between the way 
journalists--especially the most prominent ones--think about their 
impact and the way the public does. In movies of the 1930s reporters were 
gritty characters who instinctively sided with the common man. In the 
1970s Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, starring as Bob Woodward and Carl 
Bernstein in <I><A HREF="http://rte66.com/M/title-exact?title=All+the+President%27s+Men">All the President's Men</A></I>, were better-paid but still 
gritty reporters unafraid to challenge big power. Even the local-TV-news 
crew featured on <I>The Mary Tyler Moore Show </I>had a certain 
down-to-earth pluck. Ted Knight, as the pea-brained news anchor Ted 
Baxter, was a ridiculously pompous figure but not an arrogant one.<P>
Since the early 1980s the journalists who have shown up in movies have 
often been portrayed as more loathsome than the lawyers, politicians, and 
business moguls who are the traditional bad guys in films about the 
white-collar world. In <I><A HREF="http://rte66.com/M/title-exact?title=Absence+of+Malice">Absence of Malice</A></I>, made in 1981, an 
ambitious newspaper reporter (Sally Field) ruins the reputation of a 
businessman (Paul Newman) by rashly publishing articles accusing him of 
murder. In <I><A HREF="http://rte66.com/M/title-exact?title=Broadcast+News">Broadcast News</A></I>, released in 1987, the anchorman (William 
Hurt) is still an airhead, like Ted Baxter, but unlike Ted, he works in a 
business that is systematically hostile to anything except profit and 
bland good looks. The only sympathetic characters in the movie, an 
overeducated reporter (Albert Brooks) and a hyperactive and 
hyperidealistic producer (Holly Hunter), would have triumphed as heroes in 
a newspaper movie of the 1930s. In this one they are ground down by the 
philistines at their network.<P>
In the <I><A HREF="http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?title=Die+Hard">Die Hard</A> </I>series, which started in 1988, a TV journalist 
(William Atherton) is an unctuous creep who will lie and push helpless 
people around in order to get on the air. In <I><A HREF="http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?title=The+Bonfire+of+the+Vanities">The Bonfire of the 
Vanities</A> </I>(1990) the tabloid writer Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis) is a 
disheveled British sot who will do anything for a free drink. In <I><A HREF="http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?title=Rising+Sun">Rising 
Sun</A> </I>(1993) a newspaper reporter known as "Weasel" (Steve Buscemi) is 
an out-and-out criminal, accepting bribes to influence his coverage. As 
Antonia Zerbisias pointed out in the <I>Toronto Star</I> in 1993, movies 
and TV shows offer almost no illustrations of journalists who are not full 
of themselves, shallow, and indifferent to the harm they do. During 
Operation Desert Storm, <I>Saturday Night Live </I>ridiculed American 
reporters who asked military spokesmen questions like "Can you tell us 
exactly when and where you are going to launch your attack?" "The 
journalists were portrayed as ignorant, arrogant and pointlessly 
adversarial," Jay Rosen, of New York University, wrote about the episode. 
"By gently rebuffing their ludicrous questions, the Pentagon briefer [on 
<I>SNL</I>] came off as a model of sanity." <P>
Even real-life members of the Washington pundit corps have made their way 
into movies--Eleanor Clift, Morton Kondracke, hosts from 
<I>Crossfire</I>--in 1990s releases such as <I><A HREF="http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?title=Dave">Dave</A> </I>and <I>Rising 
Sun</I>. Significantly, their role in the narrative is as buffoons. The 
joke in these movies is how rapidly the pundits leap to conclusions, how 
predictable their reactions are, how automatically they polarize the 
debate without any clear idea of what has really occurred. That real-life 
journalists are willing to keep appearing in such movies, knowing how they 
will be cast, says something about the source of self-respect in today's 
media: celebrity, on whatever basis, matters more than being taken 
seriously.<P>
Movies do not necessarily capture reality, but they suggest a public 
mood--in this case, a contrast between the apparent self-satisfaction 
of the media celebrities and the contempt in which they are held by the 
public. "The news media has a generally positive view of itself in the 
watchdog role," wrote the authors of an exhaustive survey of public 
attitudes and the attitudes of journalists themselves toward the press. 
(The survey was conducted by the Times Mirror Center for the People and 
the Press, and was released last May.)But "the outside world strongly 
faults the news media for its negativism. . . . The public goes so far as 
to say that the press gets in the way of society solving its problems. . . 
." According to the survey, "two out of three members of the public had 
nothing or nothing good to say about the media." <P>
The media establishment is beginning to get at least an inkling of this 
message. Through the past decade discussions among newspaper editors and 
publishers have been a litany of woes: fewer readers; lower "penetration" 
rates, as a decreasing share of the public pays attention to news; a more 
and more desperate search for ways to attract the public's interest. In 
the short run these challenges to credibility are a problem for 
journalists and journalism. In the longer run they are a problem for 
democracy.<P>
<CENTER><b>TURNING A CALLING INTO <br>
A SIDESHOW</b><P>
</CENTER><font size=5>E</font>ven if practiced perfectly, journalism will leave some 
resentment and bruised feelings in its wake. The justification that 
journalists can offer for the harm they inevitably inflict is to show, 
through their actions, their understanding that what they do matters and 
that it should be done with care.<P>
This is why the most depressing aspect of the new talking-pundit industry 
may be the argument made by many practitioners:the whole thing is just a 
game, which no one should take too seriously. Michael Kinsley, a highly 
respected and indisputably talented policy journalist, has written that 
his paid speaking engagements are usually mock debates, in which he takes 
the liberal side. <P>
<blockquote>
Since the audiences are generally composed of affluent businessmen, my 
role is like that of the team that gets to lose to the Harlem 
Globetrotters. But Ido it because it pays well, because it's fun to fly 
around the country and stay in hotels, and because even a politically 
unsympathetic audience can provide a cheap ego boost.<P></blockquote>
Last year Morton Kondracke, of <I>The McLaughlin Group</I>, told Mark 
Jurkowitz, of <I>The Boston Globe</I>, "This is not writing, this is not 
thought." He was describing the talk-show activity to which he has devoted 
a major part of his time for fifteen years. "You should not take it a 
hundred percent seriously. Anybody who does is a fool." Fred Barnes wrote 
that he was happy to appear in a mock <I>McLaughlin</I> segment on 
<I>Murphy Brown</I>, because "the line between news and fun barely exists 
anymore."<P>
<I>The McLaughlin Group</I> often takes its act on the road, gimmicks and 
all, for fees reported to be about $20,000 per appearance. <I>Crossfire 
</I>goes for paid jaunts on the road. So do panelists from <I>The Capital 
Gang</I>. Contracts for such appearances contain a routine clause 
specifying that the performance may not be taped or broadcast. This 
provision allows speakers to recycle their material, especially those who 
stitch together anecdotes about "the mood in Washington today." It also 
reassures the speakers that the sessions aren't really serious. They won't 
be held to account for what they say, so the normal standards don't 
apply.<P>
Yet the fact that no one takes the shows seriously is precisely what's 
wrong with them, because they jeopardize the credibility of everything 
that journalists do. "I think one of the really destructive developments in 
Washington in the last fifteen years has been the rise in these reporter 
talk shows,"Tom Brokaw has said. "Reporters used to cover policy--not 
spend all of their time yelling at each other and making philistine 
judgments about what happened the week before. It's not enlightening. It 
makes me cringe."<P>
When talk shows go on the road for performances in which hostility and 
disagreement are staged for entertainment value; when reporters pick up 
thousands of dollars appearing before interest groups and sharing tidbits 
of what they have heard; when all the participants then dash off for the 
next plane, caring about none of it except the money--when these 
things happen, they send a message. The message is: We don't respect what 
we're doing. Why should anyone else? <P>

<blockquote>
	


<p>


<b>Do you think the sheer number of news shows has reduced the quality of
reporting?</b><p>

<p>

I think they're changing the culture in which journalists do their work. It's
important to remember that journalism is not a formal profession. There are no
official standards for it. That's good because this allows journalism to be
flexible and responsive; it's good because styles can change. It's bad because
bad habits can set in. There's been a style of journalism in the last ten or
fifteen years that has become destructive--a professional and economic culture
of opinionizing, attitude, exaggeration, and polarization, which has been good
for journalists but bad for journalism and the country. What journalists need
to do to get most noticed and make the most money is bad for the profession. I
make a comparison in the book with the world of sports. You could argue that
Michael Jordan makes too much money, or that Cal Ripken or Deion Sanders makes
too much money, but what they make too much money for is a logical extension of
what they should be doing. The way you make a lot of money in journalism is to
do things you shouldn't be doing.<p>

<p>

<b>Is the public to blame for any of this shift in the media?</b><p>

<p>

I think that if people didn't watch the crudest kinds of talk shows there would
be less of a market for them. But some of the habits that become most
pernicious in journalism aren't really supported by a public market. For
example, in <i>Breaking the News</i> I talk a lot about the way the game of
politics has stamped out the substance of politics and political reporting. For
example, in the last two or three weeks there have been endless reports about
whether Gingrich, Clinton, or Dole has won the budget battle. There have been
very few reports about what's actually at stake for the public. But there's
almost no evidence that win-lose reporting is driven by a public demand.
There's no indication that people want to hear more about the game of politics.
Let me give one other illustration. It was true in the last year that
O.J.-mania seized the nation and almost every news outlet felt they had to do
something O.J.-related to stay in business. But it becomes a matter of degree.
The network news broadcaster who did the least O.J. reporting--ABC--had the
strongest ratings for the year.<p>


<p>

<b>Does public journalism have a chance?</b><p>

<p>

It has already succeeded in a lot of political papers. This is a debate that
would have seemed peculiar ten or fifteen years ago. Now we have a religious
war among the public journalists, the journalism advocates, and some of the
bigshot newspaper editors about subjects where, in the end, they agree. Or they
should agree. When Len Downey from <i>The Washington Post</i> and people from
the <i>The New York Times</i> look at the projects that have been done in the
name of public journalism in North Carolina or Ohio, they think, "Oh, that's
just good journalism." They almost never complain about the projects
themselves. What they complain about is the label "public journalism." So I
think the way that public journalism will ultimately win the battle is when
people stop using that label for it and say instead, "Okay, what is good
journalism?"<p>

<p>

<b>Do you think that other journalists are going to use this book as cover for
their own condemnations of the media?</b><p>

<p>

I think so. The main reason that I decided to write the book was that the
situation in my business resembled so powerfully what I remembered seeing in a
different institution fifteen years ago--the military after the Vietnam war. It
was a professional culture that was clearly in trouble. The people who had gone
into the military were on the whole high-minded; they could have made more
money other places, but they liked the military way of life. After being in
there ten or fifteen years, they were embarrassed about a lot, and while
they're sensitive about being criticized from outside, they themselves were
very critical about what was happening. The same thing is true in mainstream
journalism now. People for the most part didn't go into it just to be on TV, or
just to become famous, or just to make as much money as they could--because
that's not the best way to do those things. As time has gone on they have
become embarrassed by that shift in attitude and so my guess is that people
whom I don't criticize by name in this book will agree with it. The other ones
may not.<p>

<p>

<b>What kind of reviews do you expect?</b><p>

<p>

I would expect some divided response. I know of some reviews that will be
coming out that are very positive. I know of some that will be hostile. It's
going to be interesting to me to see how the hostile ones are couched. If
people try to say, "Hey, everything's great with the press," that's going to be
a tough sell. So I think the hostile reviews are either going to have to say,
"This guy Fallows is a creep," or they'll have to say, "Public journalism is a
crock." I think those are the two prongs that a hostile review could take. <p>

<p>

<b>Are you in any danger of any doors closing for you as a journalist?</b><p>

<p>

I don't think so, but I may have put a low ceiling on my career as
a TV pundit.<p>

<p>

<b>Is there a model of good reporting, of good coverage, right now?</b><p>

<p>

There's a reason why I so much enjoy working for <i>The Atlantic</i>. It's
because I think that what Bill Whitworth wants month in and month out is part
of what journalism really should be. Obviously, a monthly magazine's headlines
are different from others, and so the situation is different from that of a
newspaper, but I think that Bill has been consistently interested in the meat
of the issue--Why does this really matter? He gets to the point and gives our
readers something that's useful. I think this is a model. I mentioned a couple
of models in the book. I think that <i>The Wall Street Journal </i>news staff,
as distinguished from its editorial staff, is interesting. In my opinion, the
editorial staff is made up of ideological pamphleteers; they are just sort of
hammering home their view of the world each day. What's interesting about
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>'s news staff is that they whittle down their
obligation to cover the breaking news and say, "Okay, we're going to give a
cursory nod to the breaking news, but we're going to really stand on our
investigative talent, on a more creative approach, and on finding things that
we think are important--anything from how the telecommunications industry is
changing to whether Indonesian refugees are doing this or that in California."
They're not being driven by the breaking news, though they acknowledge it. I
think that National Public Radio also does a valuable job of that. I have a
very peripheral involvement with them. I do commentaries for them; I have no
connection whatsoever with their news staff. I think that <i>The</i> <i>New
York Times</i>, while I pick a lot of fights with them in this book, has very
impressive overall coverage of the world. And I think that this brings up a
really crucial point: most people who are journalists are both intelligent and
honest. On an average day you can find that most stories in the newspaper or on
broadcast news are reasonable stories; they're valuable to somebody. It becomes
a question of proportion and overall emphasis and tone. It's not a matter of
rewriting every story that's in the paper. But if ten or fifteen percent of the
stories were not about the latest fight between Gingrich and Clinton, and
instead were about how this affects your life and my life tomorrow--that's the
kind of shift in tone I'm talking about.<p>

Hemutters frequently, counting under his breath and pointing vaguely at storewindows. He expounds enthusiastically upon footcandles andprice-point-to-aperture ratios. He is cast into gloom by what he callsinternally illuminated signs.<p></font>Gibbs has the sort of occupation Anne Tyler might invent for a character in oneof her novels. He is a retail consultant who travels the country telling townsand small cities how to survive and prosper by learning the lessons of theshopping mall. Trained as a landscape architect at the <A HREF="http://www.umich.edu/">University of Michiganat Ann Arbor</A>, Gibbs worked for a dozen years as a retailing specialist in theservice of strip-shopping-center and shopping-mall developers, studying,debating, and adjusting virtually everything that might affect a shopper's moodin the marketplace, from color schemes to the location of escalators. In awell-run mall, Gibbs says, even the benches are positioned so that the shopperat rest cannot help gazing at the wares offered in store windows. Theoverriding imperative is to lose no opportunity, no matter how small, to make asale. <p><A HREF="./mallind.htm"><img src="../../../images/shorsera.gif" align=leftvspace=10 hspace=10 border=0></A>Gibbs walks down Clematis Street, the main shopping street in West Palm Beach,Florida, as if he were navigating a maze, seeming utterly distracted even as hesearches intently for clues to the street's secrets. At forty he still hassomething of the smirking manner of the high school wise guy. But on ClematisStreet he is all business. <p>Gibbs is impressed that most of the trash cans and newspaper vending machineshave been painted the same dark green, a fashionable hue now used in manymalls. Even a pair of two-by-fours supporting a tree have been painted. "Alittle detail you would expect in mall management," Gibbs says approvingly.<p> At the corner of Clematis and Dixie Highway, one of the main intersections intown, a new gym has opened, its large plate-glass windows displaying itsclientele to passing pedestrians and motorists. The gym is what Gibbs calls a"generator": the traffic it draws will help attract related businesses, such asrestaurants, fast-food outlets, perhaps a sporting-goods store, to the emptystorefronts nearby. <p>The gym is also a brilliant piece of street theater, telling all who pass itswindows that West Palm is young, hip, and attractive. It is not here byaccident. Borrowing a page from shopping-mall management, the city's DowntownDevelopment Authority and the City Center Partnership, an allied localnonprofit organization, have used loans and other incentives to manipulate the"tenant mix." They worked for four years to lure the gym to this importantlocation. The DDA is a significant advantage to West Palm Beach, as is theenergetic mayor, Nancy M. Graham. The city has attracted several plum projectsin recent years, including a massive new county courthouse. In 1992 the citycouncil approved a $12 million bond issue to renovate the downtown district.Other money was appropriated to convert Clematis from a one-way into a two-waystreet and to install new sidewalks, lights, and palm trees.<p>Half a block east of the gym, at 331 Clematis, Provident Jewelry &amp; Loanoffers more evidence of the city's ability to shape the street. A pawnshop thatonce lent a vaguely disreputable air to the neighborhood, Provident has beentransformed with the aid of loans from the City Center Partnership. With afresh coat of paint, a dapper awning, and a prim new sign that doesn't shout"pawnshop," it has become an upright citizen and an asset to Clematis Street.The Imperial Gallery, a frame shop, and The Last Resort, a Generation Xclothing store, both opened up with loans and other help. <p>	<A HREF="./mallbig.htm"><img src="./mallsart.gif" align=right width=200 height=300 hspace=10 vspace=10 border=0 alt="(Mall Art)"></A>Elsewhere on Clematis a large old building is being carved up into smallerstores. To lend their operations a bit of local flavor, well-managed mallsoften create tiny low-rent spaces called "incubators" and recruit localentrepreneurs to set up shop; some of them will thrive and open bigger stores.West Palm Beach is doing the same thing. <p>There are reasons to be hopeful about West Palm Beach, and about other townsand cities that are willing to borrow intelligently from the lessons of themall. For the first time in decades strong trends in the national retail marketseem to be working in their favor. A reaction is setting in against themonotony and homogeneity of the shopping mall. People are spending less time inmalls--an average of only an hour and a half to two hours a month this year,according to one source, as compared with three and a half hours a month in1990--and few new malls are being built. Only four new regional malls (800,000square feet or larger) opened in the United States last year, as compared withtwenty-seven in 1989. <p>Part of the explanation for this change is simply that suburban markets havebecome saturated, and part is that strip shopping centers, "big-box" retailers,and "power centers" that bring high-volume discounters together in one locationare drawing customers away from the malls. But mall fatigue is a potent factor.In focus groups people tell Gibbs that they are tired of shopping in mallsfilled with the same stores that they can find everywhere else in the country.Many say they want to shop in downtowns, in quaint, one-of-a-kind stores. Gibbsdoes not have a monopoly on this intelligence. Retailers are alreadyresponding. Nordstrom has recently agreed to open a store in downtown Norfolk,Virginia. Even major discount retailers like Caldor and Kmart are feeling thelure of downtown markets. Kmart plans to open a store in Manhattan next year,in the historic Herald Square shopping district. "Signs of an urban boom can befound almost everywhere," the trade publication <i>Shopping Centers Today</i>reported last fall.<p><font size=5>G</font><font size=3>ibbs came to West Palm Beach, a city of more than 70,000, two years ago, towork on a new master plan for the city with Andres Duany and <A HREF-"http://rossi.arc.miami.edu/intro/faculty/zyberk.htm">ElizabethPlater-Zyberk</A>, the Miami-based pioneers of the New Urbanism. This small butinfluential movement among architects and urban planners proposes to revivenineteenth-century town-planning principles, using denser development andgridded street systems, among other things, as an antidote to suburban sprawl.Duany and Plater-Zyberk's greatest success so far has been the much-publicizednew town of Seaside, a resort community in the Florida panhandle. But Gibbs'senthusiasm for the New Urbanist cause and for downtowns in general doesn't stophim from working for the occasional shopping-mall company that seeks hisservices. And his own office, with its small staff, is located not in a grittycity but in the genteel downtown of Birmingham, Michigan, an affluent Detroitsuburb.<p>What Gibbs contributes to complex cooperative projects like the one in WestPalm Beach is a commercial sensibility unlike anything possessed by the urbanplanners and architects who usually design downtown-renewal efforts. Addressingaudiences of such specialists, Gibbs takes a puckish delight in shocking themwith his views on conventional urban planning. He shows them slides of ageneric "success" in street design and then points out, feature by feature, howthe design actually hurts the town's businesses.<p>The shade trees and planter boxes? Lovely, he says, but they block shoppers'view of shop windows and signs. Those handsome groupings of benches and tables?They seem inviting until Gibbs points out that they often attract teenagers andother loiterers, who scare off shoppers. The elegant Victorian streetlamps, theexpensive trash cans, and the distinctive granite paving stones--"so beautifulthat people will stare at them as they walk by the storefronts," Gibbssays--are little more than money down the drain. Their costs must be amortizedover many years, but long before they have been paid off (and before the towncan afford to replace them) they will be old-fashioned, marking the entirestreet as out of date and out of step. <p>Gibbs sometimes clinches an argument by showing his audience slides of some ofthe world's most opulent shopping streets, including Palm Beach's Worth Avenue,which happens to be located about a mile (and a world) away from ClematisStreet. The Worth Avenue slide reveals a pleasant but extremely plain street.It is lined with a row of palms and simple light poles. Its sidewalks,conspicuously, are mere concrete.<p>As Gibbs and I traverse Clematis Street over the course of two days, he pausestime and again to consider the textured sidewalk paving blocks that have beeninstalled since his last visit. There is no question that they are attractive.But are they too porous to keep clean? Too fancy? <p>This is not the kind of question that planners and architects often askthemselves. They tend to see streets and sidewalks strictly as a civic realm, asocial environment where people meet and interact, and they tend to favor thesorts of attractive sidewalks and streetscapes that seem to promotesociability. If they are not greatly concerned about the impact of their workon the welfare of haberdashers and stationers, that is not surprising. Theybelong to professions that are often at war with commercial interests. <p>Gibbs sees the street first as a commercial space. Nourish commerce, hisimplicit credo goes, and the people will come. A dirty street, a sidewalkspotted with old chewing gum and grime, is a turnoff for shoppers. And ifpeople won't come downtown to shop, there simply won't be a civic realm.<p>Fear of crime is one of the things that keep them away, and grimy sidewalks areone of many signs that hint at disorder, in Gibbs's view. Standing outside thegym at the corner of Clematis and Dixie Highway, he discourses at length on anuntidy collection of benches, tables, and chairs outside a caf&eacute; acrossthe highway. This is civic space only in theory. In fact it poses a threat tocivic existence. "Those benches make it look like this is a very difficultplace to walk," he says, putting himself in the shoes of the average (that is,female) shopper. "You've got to squeeze between those benches. And if ateenager or some street person happens to be there, you would have to touchthem, because you're so close together. That is like a sign saying DON'TENTER."<p>Ironically, one of the forces working in favor of downtowns today is theerosion of the shopping malls' image as a safe haven from crime. Only a fewyears ago, Gibbs reminds me, it was rare to see uniformed security officers inmalls, because the mere sight of a uniform was thought to be unsettling toshoppers. Today uniformed guards seem reassuring, and they can be seen in mallseverywhere. Even janitors are equipped with thick, military-style belts andwalkie-talkies. Parking lots are patrolled by security vehicles that proclaimtheir presence with roof-mounted flashing lights. The Palm Beach Mall, just afew miles from Clematis Street, is so notorious locally as a dangerous placethat all pretenses have been abandoned: the parking lot is studded with tallobservation towers, making it resemble nothing so much as a prison yard. <p>Towns, Gibbs insists, must follow the malls' example in dealing with thepublic's fears. That means ensuring a visible police presence, removing orrearranging benches and other features that encourage loitering, and keepingthe streets and sidewalks clean. Mall managers, ever inventive, are nowimproving the lighting in their parking lots. The norm for illumination was afootcandle or less just a few years ago, Gibbs says. Now it is closer to threefootcandles. Many self-service gas stations, which must offer a reassuringprospect to lure passing motorists off the road, are now lit up like Hollywoodsound stages. The lighting in West Palm Beach? Three quarters to onefootcandle, Gibbs estimated.<p><font size=5>A</font><font size=3>town's retail planning, Gibbs says, should begin<br>where a mall's does--farfrom the selling floors. A simple example of mall thinking is what Gibbs callsthe "no-left-turn rule": Never locate a shopping center in a place wherecommuters will have to make a left turn to get in. People tend to shop on theirway home from work, the thinking goes, and they are less likely to stop if itinvolves making a turn against traffic.<p>This is no idle observation. At one point in his career Gibbs traveled aroundthe country as a member of a team evaluating sites for future shopping malls.Gibbs recalls that the opinion of the traffic consultant mattered most. Hevetoed so many sites that he was called The Terminator.<p>There is a corollary for towns and strip shopping centers: coffee shops anddoughnut stores ought to be located on the workbound side of a main road,grocery stores and other services on the homebound side. "Just one left turnwill kill you," Gibbs says. <p>Mall merchandising begins in the parking lot. Gibbs points out that at theGardens of the Palm Beaches, an upscale mall several miles from West PalmBeach, the plantings around the building and parking lots, with their lush,tightly trimmed shrubs, seem to suggest that shoppers are arriving at a specialplace, and that perhaps they are special as well. It's almost like having adoorman. It's certainly a far cry from the feeling one gets in the rundown WestPalm Beach parking lot where Gibbs and I parked.<p>Once, guiding me into a lavish urban mall called Georgetown Park, inWashington, D.C., Gibbs was able to predict which way I would turn uponentering. Most casual shoppers who are not immediately bound for a specificstore--which is to say most shoppers--travel counterclockwise. Nobody knowswhy, though it's reasonable to suppose that driving on the right-hand side ofthe road has something to do with it. A good mall designer will take specialcare to ensure that entering shoppers have a powerful unobstructed vista ofstorefronts to their right. Rarely will that vista run the length of the mall,however. It is a cardinal rule to keep shoppers' eyes on the merchandise at alltimes. Designers try to configure malls with enough twists and turns that theshopper looking ahead is constantly looking toward a wall of storefronts. Gibbsis so convinced of the importance of what he calls the "deflected view" that inlaying out the main shopping street of a small new development in Novi,Michigan, he put two thirty-degree turns near its middle. Straight streets, hebelieves, are one of the biggest commercial handicaps of a town like West PalmBeach.<p>There are other rules. Clothing stores, for example, should never be locatednext to restaurants: for some reason the smell of food hurts clothing sales. Indowntown areas clothing stores should never be located on the north side of astreet: the colors of clothes displayed in a shop window with a southernexposure begin to fade within hours. Western exposures are bad for restaurants:the setting sun at dinnertime makes customers uncomfortable. Restaurants canprosper on side streets and in other less-desirable locations, because theyusually do not rely heavily on drop-in business. They are destinations. Mostretail stores count on drawing a lot of impulse shoppers, and thus need to belocated in high-traffic areas. <p>Designers also know that the average shopper, strolling along at three or fourfeet per second, walks past a storefront in about eight seconds. That's howlong a shop owner has to grab a consumer's attention with an arresting windowdisplay. Downtown merchants must live with the same eight-second rule, but theycan also sell to passing motorists--and the window of opportunity for"merchandising to the car," as Gibbs puts it, is less than a second. <p>Sophisticated retailers use a variety of subliminal clues to attract shoppers.At Georgetown Park, Gibbs pointed out a high-priced stationery store that hadcreated a window display featuring a small old wooden desk with a few priceywriting implements casually strewn about, including four ordinary-seeming leadpencils in a wooden box, priced at $215. The tableau, Gibbs informed me, was"lifestyling" par excellence--focusing the shopper's attention not on the goodsthemselves but on attractive things associated with them. Buy theseoutrageously expensive pencils, the display suggested, and you will have takenone more step toward a life of tweeds and contemplation in the Englishcountryside. <p>The lifestyling message was amplified by the window designer's skillfulexploitation of what is called the price-point-to-aperture ratio. The appealingdesk-and-pencils tableau was framed inside the window, much as a picture ispositioned inside a mat in a picture frame. In retailing the size of theaperture is often used to provide shoppers with clues about what is in a store.A relatively small enclosed space suggests high quality and prices to match.This is one reason why Tiffany &amp; Co. displays its wares to passersby intiny vaultlike spaces. Big windows and big displays generally suggest lowerprices.<p><font size=5>T</font><font size=3>he Duany and Plater-Zyberk plan for West Palm Beach calls for arevitalized downtown core and also thousands of units of new housing in thesurrounding area, now a depressing jumble of empty lots, old buildings, and gasstations. The dimensions of the challenge facing the city became clear to meafter I drove through the area for the first time on heavily traveled DixieHighway: I sped through the intersection with Clematis without realizing thatit was the heart of downtown West Palm Beach, not just another cross street inthe area's endless grid of semi-urban sprawl.<p>In the past the neglect of commerce by planners and architects was compoundedby an inability to cope with the automobile. The car has generally been treatedas an enemy, with disastrous results for downtown commerce. During the 1960sand 1970s, for example, there was a great vogue in planning circles for banningcars from downtown streets and creating pedestrian malls. The experiment wasdisastrous. Many downtown malls have since been ripped up, and the streetsrebuilt for automotive traffic. <p>Surveying a small parking lot just off Clematis, Gibbs says that a conventionalurban planner would waste no time converting it into a park, with benches,trees, and perhaps a fountain. "The shoppers will be happier if they have aplace to sit and watch the fountain," he says, in disdainful deadpan imitationof a hypothetical planner's argument. In Gibbs's view, the problem is thatpeople won't stop, park their cars, and get out to visit such a park. And ifthey don't do that, the merchants of West Palm Beach won't have an opportunityto sell them anything. <p>Slowly, however, towns are coming to grips with the car. At the intersection ofClematis and El Campeon Boulevard, Gibbs can barely make himself heard over theroar of heavy machinery. Even before he and his colleagues were called in tohelp draw up the new master plan, city officials had decided to reroute thetraffic that flows over one of the Palm Beach bridges and around the outskirtsof town onto an extended and widened El Campeon, recently renamed Quadrille.The goal, virtually unheard of in late-twentieth-century America, is to pumpmore cars into the downtown. <p>For Gibbs's purposes, not just any kind of traffic will do. Just east of thatintersection Clematis Street is bisected by U.S. 1--which is actually twoone-way roads when it passes through West Palm Beach. Cars and trucks speed by,creating a forbidding double moat that slashes through Clematis and discouragespedestrians from walking the length of the street. <p>The city's new master plan calls for a radical alteration of the trafficpattern. Both branches of U.S. 1 will be converted into two-way roads, withon-street parking, one lane in each direction, and a turning lane. Instead offlowing through town as quickly as water, traffic will slow to the speed ofsyrup. The idea is to transform this soulless thoroughfare into a vital citystreet.<p>As Gibbs sees it, Clematis Street is fighting the same problem that a lot ofother American main streets are: it doesn't have a purpose anymore. During the1920s it connected the train station, on the west end of town, with the ferryto Palm Beach, on the east end. But after two bridges, on either side of town,began funneling traffic around Clematis, its fate was sealed. The Woolworth's,the McCrory's, and the Sears, Roebuck all continued to prosper for a while, butbusiness inevitably followed the cars.<p>Historians analyzing the decline of America's towns and cities after the SecondWorld War usually put most of the responsibility on the federal government'shead. The interstate highway system and federal mortgage subsidies forsingle-family homes spurred suburban growth, the argument goes, and doomed thedowntowns. In Gibbs's version of urban history, based on his travels, anotherforce looms large: the highway bypass. As the number of cars on the road soaredafter the war, town merchants and residents sought relief from traffic-cloggedstreets. Their demands coincided with the interests of the state highwaydepartments and traffic engineers, who wanted to keep building roads and whosehighest professional goal was the unimpeded flow of cars. Routing highwaytraffic around the outskirts of town must have seemed the obvious thing to do.The downtowns thus unwittingly initiated their own march to a commercial grave.<p>Retailers flock to what Gibbs and other retailing specialists call a"main-main" intersection--the place where the two most heavily traveled roadsin an area meet. Historically, towns grew up around main-mains. In one townafter another across the country, the opening of a new bypass created a newmain-main outside town. There, beginning in the 1950s, strip shopping centersbegan sprouting. Then came the interstate highways, creating where they crossedstate highways or other interstates a new set of main-mains still farther fromthe old downtowns. It is usually at these new crossroads that one finds largeregional shopping malls today.<p><font size=5>S</font><font size=3>tanding on the south side of Clematis under a hot Florida sun, Gibbs launchesinto an impassioned diagnosis--almost an autopsy--of a men's clothing store onthe other side of the street, at No. 335. This touches on the matters that seemclosest to his heart. Minutes before, he dragged me into the store almostagainst my will. Housed in an eighty-year-old two-story building painted thecolor of putty, the store features a large blue umbrella awning overhung by alarge internally illuminated white-plastic sign. The store's name appears inbig letters of washed-out blue over the tag line MEN'S WEAR--SHOES. The signseems to date from the 1950s or 1960s.<p>Inside, the store was everything I had feared--small, cramped, dark, and, inmore ways than one, stuffy. Shoes and sport coats were displayed in closedglass cases, and the store was dominated by a counter with cash register in themiddle of the floor. The proprietor seemed to watch us suspiciously.<p>On the sidewalk Gibbs is almost angry. "You wouldn't have gone in there if Ihadn't made you," he declares, "but he sells a lot of what you wear." He reelsoff a list of brand names he spotted in his expert visual frisking of thestore: Corbin, Cole Haan, Allen-Edmonds, Bass, Sperry Top-Sider. These are"very fine names," Gibbs says, the kinds of brands that would interest affluentlocals and tourists (not to mention visiting retail consultants and writers).But the store offers passersby barely a clue about what it has for sale.<p>Its most prominent signs should promote the brand names it carries, Gibbs says,to take advantage of the millions of dollars that big companies spend onadvertising to shape perceptions of their products. And what would be good forthis store would be good for West Palm Beach. <p>"People will see `Cole Haan' and they will drive off the road," Gibbs explains."They will say, `I thought this was a dumpy area. If they sell Cole Haan, theycan't be that bad.'"<p>The store could give itself an even bigger lift, according to Gibbs, by makinguse of a few rudimentary lifestyling gestures. To hear him tell it, lifestylingis the late-twentieth-century equivalent of the barber pole, announcing toshoppers what's for sale. It is ubiquitous in the mall but virtuallynonexistent on Clematis Street and other American main streets. Its vocabularyis easily acquired. Simply placing a canoe paddle or a bicycle in the window ofthe men's store, Gibbs says, would telegraph several messages to passingshoppers, including the vital (and correct) information that it is sellingclothes that fit what Gibbs classifies as "the L. L. Bean look." <p>Down the street, at Mac Fabrics, we count seven signs with the store's name onthem, and none displaying brand names. "Brands are what give you credibility,"Gibbs says. If he had his way, signs advertising brand names would hang fromthe imitation-antique light poles that line the street.<p>This, obviously, is not a sentimental view of the American town. Gibbs is notproposing to restore the cozy village of the popular imagination. Nor does hethink that the town will ever eradicate the malls, Wal-Marts, power centers,and other commercial innovations of American retailing. The American shopper'sexpectations have by now been completely conditioned by malls and nationaladvertisers. The shopper wants, at the very least, much more choice than thetraditional town ever provided. <p>The same people who tell Gibbs in focus groups that they are tired of mallscomplain that many small towns are, well, too small. Why drive half an hour tobrowse through only a handful of stores? Gibbs's rule of thumb is that a townneeds at least 200,000 square feet of retail space, about the same amount as ina small mall, to become what retailers call a destination--a place that peopleare willing to travel to. <p>And once they get to their destination, people don't really want to shop inold-fashioned small-town stores. Americans, in their time-honored way, want avariety of often contradictory things. They may like quaint, one-of-a-kindstores that seem to sell unique merchandise, but they also want the comfort andsecurity of national brand names on the goods they buy, and they don't want topay a lot for them. <p>Mall operators and national retailers are moving quickly to give people whatthey want, and Gibbs's message is that towns must do so too if they wish tosurvive and prosper. That still leaves plenty of room for individuality. Eachtown must build on its unique strengths and its unique markets. What can't beescaped, however, is the need for a conscious strategy for commercial survival.<p><font size=5>G</font><font size=3>ibb's prescriptions for the streets of West Palm Beach and of other Americantowns and small cities borrow so heavily from the mall that it becomesdifficult to see how, except for the absence of a roof over its streets, aplace reconstructed along such lines would differ from a mall. It might be atown, but would it be a community?<p>When I ask him about this, Gibbs just shrugs his shoulders. He is not aphilosopher-king. He does not pretend to know how to deliver an active civiclife and a sense of community, but he believes that these things are impossiblewithout a vital commercial life. That is something that he <i>can</i> helpdeliver. <p>He is not particularly worried that his prescriptions will lead to thehomogenization of Main Street. The mall is a machine for shopping. In contrast,the pieces of the downtown shopping machine lie about unassembled, and in alllikelihood they will never be put together in the way that they can be in amall, with its single corporate owner. Main Street will always retain a certainredeeming randomness. But if it does not learn the ways of the shopping mall,it will not retain much economic vitality. People who care about cities, Gibbssays, should be outraged that mom-and-pop shoe-store owners renting space in amall or a strip center enjoy the benefits of the latest thinking in retailing,while those who open for business downtown get virtually no help at all. <p>It is hard not to feel some trepidation about the world Robert Gibbs imagines.But it is also hard not to agree with him that commerce matters, even to theworld his critics might prefer. The Greeks, after all, cherished their agora,but it was always first and foremost a place of business. It is probably truethat community and civic spirit, like happiness and love, are often found whenyou're not looking--sometimes even when you're out shopping. </blockquote><hr><pre></pre><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

<blockquote>
	<i><font size=4>A fictionalized essay that has been circulating within the Pentagon offers 
a blunt warning on several fronts.</i></font><p>
	
	
	<pre>
	
	</pre>
	
	<font size=5>I</font>t is the year 2012. The American military has carried out a successful 
coup d'etat. Jailed and awaiting execution for resistance to the coup, a 
retired military officer writes to an old comrade, explaining how the coup 
came about.<P>
So begins a treatise entered last year in the National Defense 
University's Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Strategy Essay 
Competition. Titled "The Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012," 
and written by an active-duty Air Force officer, the essay went on to be 
selected as one of two winners of the competition. The author, Lieutenant 
Colonel Charles Dunlap, was honored by General Colin Powell at the awards 
ceremony.<P>
Looking back from a vantage point supposedly twenty years in the future, 
Dunlap writes that after years of being handed the tough jobs the rest of 
the government seemed incapable of handling, the military simply decided 
to step in and run the show. Like all science fiction, Dunlap's essay is 
really about the present. His coup entices the reader to his real subject: 
the worrisome drift of the U.S. military into civilian affairs.<P>
"Faced with intractable national problems on one hand, and an energetic 
and capable military on the other," Dunlap's condemned prisoner warns, "it 
can be all too seductive to start viewing the military as a cost-effective 
solution. We made a terrible mistake when we allowed the armed forces to 
be diverted from its original purpose." The prisoner sees a kind of 
inevitability to the coup. Amid rising crime, failing schools, a stagnant 
economy, and a gridlocked political system, the can-do U.S. military stood 
out in a no-solution society. Having remade themselves in the aftermath of 
Vietnam, the armed forces emerged from the Gulf War as "America's 
most--and perhaps only--trusted arm of government."<P>
And so it was that the military was given the hard tasks that had defeated 
the civilian side of government. By 1991 the Defense Department was 
spending $1.2 billion a year on drug intervention; the military was also 
becoming heavily involved in education. Abroad, the U.S. military had 
jumped into humanitarian missions in Bangladesh, the Philippines, and 
northern Iraq. From there, recounts the prisoner, it was only too easy for 
the military to begin taking over environmental clean-up jobs, providing 
air transport to regions abandoned by bankrupt airlines, and further 
expanding its vast medical system into civilian health care.<P>
Dunlap's fictional prisoner describes what happened as a result:<P>
"When Iranian armies started pouring into the lower Gulf states in 2010, 
the U.S. armed forces were ready to do anything but fight.<P>
"People in the military no longer considered themselves warriors. Instead, 
they perceived themselves as policemen, relief workers, educators, 
builders, health care providers, politicians--everything but war-fighters. 
When these philanthropists met the Iranian 10th Armed Corps near Daharan 
during the Second Gulf War, they were brutally slaughtered by a military 
which had not forgotten what militaries were supposed to do or what war is 
really all about."<P>
In Dunlap's essay it is America's defeat in this war that helped 
precipitate the coup. By then, the military had long become accustomed to 
having a significant role in civilian policy-making. And, owing to the 
consolidation of the armed forces in the year 2007 into a single unified 
service--a move that Pentagon reformers had long promoted as a sensible 
and economical alternative to "wasteful" service rivalry-
military power was concentrated in fewer hands than ever before.<P>
Dunlap does what a good essayist should do: he makes his reader see 
familiar phenomena in a new light. As my newspaper's Pentagon 
correspondent, I pick up the Defense Department's "Early Bird" compendium 
of newspaper clippings and, since reading Dunlap, almost every day find 
myself taken aback. In the wake of the military relief mission to victims 
of Hurricane Andrew, the editors of the Tulsa Tribune, the Anniston 
(Alabama) Star, and dozens of other papers across the country urge the 
military to take over the government's disaster-relief operations. I read 
about the U.S. military's humanitarian mission to Somalia. Over the fax 
machine comes news of the Pentagon's plan to nearly double the size of its 
Junior ROTC program, to include almost 3,000 high schools. The 
announcement quotes President George Bush as saying that Junior ROTC is "a 
great program that boosts high school competition, high school completion 
rates, reduces drug use, raises self
esteem, and gets these kids firmly on the right track."<P>
Then I think of the warning issued by Dunlap's prisoner: "Even back in 
1992 we should have seen this coming."<P>
<BR>

Is "The Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012" something to be 
taken seriously? Yes, it is, even if one may be skeptical about just how 
likely to occur the developments that Dunlap points to really are.<P>
In his book The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of 
Civil-Military Relations, the Harvard political scientist Samuel P. 
Huntington identifies a strong streak of antimilitarism in American 
politics. It has typically manifested itself through one of two impulses: 
the impulse to cut military budgets and the impulse to use the military 
"to further other socially desirable objectives." That is to say, the 
historical tendency in America has been to attempt either to reduce the 
military or to transform it. Obscured somewhat by the fifty years of the 
Cold War, this pattern is now reasserting itself. Dunlap has read 
Huntington and cites The Soldier and the State in his treatise.<P>
As iconoclastic as it may appear for a U.S. military officer to raise the 
prospect of a military coup, Dunlap's essay, which has just been published 
in the Army War College's journal, Parameters, is actually a conservative 
document. Many officers worry with Dunlap that the military's new missions 
are placing it on a slippery slope that will degrade its ability to fight. 
For years, students at the services' war colleges have had hammered into 
them that the lesson of Vietnam is that "we must once again become masters 
of the profession of arms," as the retired Army Colonel Harry Summers 
wrote in On Strategy, an analysis that has been enormously influential in 
the post-Vietnam military. Harry Summers doesn't see a coup in our future, 
but he does believe that Dunlap is right to be concerned about loading up 
the military with ancillary missions. "I think we've got to constantly be 
on guard against any military intrusion into the civil sector," he told me 
recently. "We always have to nip these things in the bud."<P>
There are buds aplenty these days. I have mentioned some of them above. 
Dunlap's paper is crammed with footnotes citing news reports of other 
nonmilitary initiatives already proposed for or undertaken by the U.S. 
armed forces. Some senior officers still spooked by Vietnam are eager to 
take on popular missions like drug interception and disaster relief. Many 
of their subordinates are only too happy to go along. In Florida, Andrew 
Baer, an enlisted man from Dumas, Texas, told a Washington Post reporter, 
"I'm glad we're here doing something good for Americans in America rather 
than off in some God-forsaken place around the world fighting a war for 
somebody else that nobody here supports. Everyone appreciates what we're 
doing, and it gives you a real good feeling." You can almost hear 
Clausewitz roll over and scream.<P>
Congress has happily supported the search for new missions. Indeed, in its 
report on its defense bill for 1993, the Senate Armed Services Committee 
stated plainly to the Defense Department that the post-Cold War 
environment means that the armed forces will have a much greater 
opportunity than in the past to assist civilian efforts to address 
critical domestic problems." Of course, the biggest reason for mission 
expansion these days is pure Willie Suttonism: that is where the money is. 
This year's defense budget of $275 billion isn't far below Cold War 
levels, and it remains the biggest pot of free-flowing money in a 
deficit-frozen government. Dreaming up new ways to justify maintaining 
expenditures at Soviet-era levels in the post-Soviet world occupies more 
than a few Pentagon planners.<P>
It is unlikely, however, that military spending will remain at anything 
like the present level, and this fact is the surest obstacle to a literal 
playing-out of Dunlap's scenario. Unwilling to cut defense jobs in the 
midst of a near-recession, congressional liberals held their noses last 
year and treated the defense budget as a second-rate jobs bill. In any 
event, they could not raid the defense budget for their own pet programs, 
because the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 prohibits applying to domestic 
purposes money saved through cuts in defense spending. However, that 
prohibition expires with the 1994 budget. As the nation winds down from 
five decades of preparedness for global war, Congress this year can and 
will start trading guns for butter. The stronger the economy, the deeper 
the defense cuts will be. Absent any new security threat, the defense 
budget could slide to $180 billion within a decade. At that level the 
generals and admirals will be so nervous about maintaining their 
"core-mission" war-fighting abilities that they will turn their backs on 
the feel-good missions they now embrace. Training for high-tech war 
consumes enormous amounts of time and money, and will take everything the 
military has.<P>
Indeed, it can be argued that the U.S. military is already withdrawing 
from its most significant social mission--that of forming human capital 
out of kids who otherwise would be a drag on society. "We're going to be 
smaller and better--we're going to pick and choose our people," says Rear 
Admiral James Lair, in a typical comment. "I don't have time to be a 
rehabilitation society. It used to be jail or the service. Now most of 
these kids are high school graduates."<P>
The present situation may closely resemble that during the First World War 
era, when the military attempted to become more involved in society, only 
to retreat as its budget dwindled. General Leonard Wood, the Army chief of 
staff from 1910 to 1914, searched for new missions, from training American 
youth to improving sanitation in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. 
When race riots tore apart Omaha, in 1919, General Wood commanded the 
1,000 armed soldiers used to restore order--an interesting parallel to 
last year's military deployment to Los Angeles, dubbed Operation Garden 
Plot by the Marines. In 1920, backed by the soap-selling savvy and fortune 
of William Procter, Wood made a run for the White House, losing the 
Republican nomination to Warren G. Harding only on the tenth ballot. His 
political career ended there. His military innovations, however, played 
out for several more years, with the National Defense Act of 1920 
expanding his camps for youths and broadening the Reserve Officers 
Training Corps. But as investigations unearthed information about 
industrial profiteering during the First World War, and as a series of 
treaties made it appear that an era of lasting world peace was at hand, 
the military was forcibly slimmed down. The turning point came in 1926, 
when the Army pushed for a bigger budget and the President stood in the 
way. So ended, Samuel Huntington observes, the military's "abortive 
identification with society."<P>
<BR>
For all its improbabilities, Dunlap's exercise in civic imagination is 
likely to be widely discussed within the U.S. military. Besides being 
published in Parameters, it will appear in the annual collection of essays 
on strategy published by the National Defense University Press. Indeed, I 
am told that the university is holding up the colonel's essay as a model 
for the kind of unfettered thinking that it wants for a professional 
magazine it is now developing.<P>
The essay is one that our officers need to read. Although many of them 
perceive at least some of the trends that worry Dunlap, they generally 
worry more about the effect that those trends will have on the military's 
war-fighting ability than about the possible erosion of distinctions 
between the military and civil society. Like other Americans, military 
officers don't dwell on the civilian-military relationship--they take it 
for granted. The official reading list for Marine officers, for example, 
includes Thucydides, Alexander Solzhenitsyn (August 1914), Paul Kennedy 
(The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers), and the memoirs of Vietnam's 
General Giap, but not Huntington on the role of the military in American 
society.<P>
Moreover, few active-duty officers have the nerve, as Dunlap has, to 
deviate publicly from current Pentagon dogma that emphasizes "jointness" 
among the services above everything. The idea of consolidation, like that 
of new missions, has obvious appeal at a time of tight budgets. But it may 
be, Dunlap suggests, that maintaining checks and balances among Army, 
Navy, Marines, and Air Force isn't so bad if it enables a democracy to 
keep a large military establishment in line.

	<font size=5>T</font>HEY say
that nothing succeeds like success, but there is one thing that can beat 
it, at
least in arts and entertainment: success followed by self-annihilation. 
Thus 
it's slightly surprising that the mass-market rediscovery of Jack Kerouac 
has
taken so long. It's been nearly forty years since the publication of <i>On 
the
Road </i>(1957) hurtled him into instant international fame--household-word
fame that he couldn't handle and gradually lost, but not before it cost 
him his
dearest friendships, the fulfillment of his artistic promise, and most of 
his
personal freedom in the twelve years remaining until his alcoholic death, 
in
1969.<p>

Surprising, but not entirely so. At marketing meetings Kerouac is no doubt
pitched as "the James Dean of American Lit.," but the real man and his work
don't fit that image, any more than he fit the marketing label "King of the
Beats" in the 1950s. His writing--quirky and digressive and not always 
easy to
read, sometimes nearly impenetrable--is more of an acquired taste than
publicists might wish. As to the man, he was a handsome guy who took a good
photo, but he was not the charismatic figure of his legend; by all 
accounts he
was shy, even insecure, possessed little personal glamour, and wasn't as
adventurous as most of his friends. He portrayed himself honestly in his 
books,
even in the most-often-quoted passage in all of his work--the point in 
<i>On
the Road </i>when Dean Moriarty (Neal Cassady) meets Carlo Marx (Allen
Ginsberg):<p>
<blockquote>
A tremendous thing happened when Dean met Carlo Marx. Two keen minds that 
they
are, they took to each other at the drop of a hat. Two piercing eyes 
glanced
into two piercing eyes--the holy con-man with the shining mind, and the
sorrowful poetic con-man with the dark mind that is Carlo Marx. From that 
moment on I saw
very little of Dean, and I was a little sorry too. Their energies met 
head-on,
I was a lout compared, I couldn't keep up with them. The whole mad swirl of
everything that was to come began then; it would mix up all my friends and 
all
I had left of my family in a big dust cloud over the American Night. . . . 
They
rushed down the street together, digging everything in the early way they 
had,
which later became so much sadder and perceptive and blank. But then they
danced down the streets like dingledodies, and I shambled after as I've 
been doing all
my life after people who interest me, because the only people for me are 
the
mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, 
desirous
of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a 
commonplace
thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding 
like
spiders across the stars. . . .</blockquote> <p>

Those phrases describing "the only people for me" are almost always quoted 
out
of context. In context, one is most struck by the narrator's 
self-deprecation
and alienation, the outsider's yearning, the fact that Kerouac never felt
himself to <i>be </i>one of those fantastic beings he admired so deeply. 
Those
who find out about the people who burn, burn, burn from a T-shirt 
inscription
don't know that Sal Paradise (the character based on Kerouac) "shambled" 
after
the "mad ones" who interested him--"a lout compared" who couldn't keep 
up.<p>

But suitable for myth or not, in the marketplace Jack is back, heralded by 
new
editions, products, and events: the two books under discussion here; a
movie-in-progress of <i>On the Road, </i>produced by Francis Ford Coppola;
museum shows on Beat culture; and even a 
<A 
HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/cdroms/95/52/index4a.html">CD-ROM</A>--which, 
I should point out, I
co-produced with my wife, Kate Bernhardt. Ann Charters, the editor of 
these two
books, was a paid consultant to that CD-ROM project, a venture proposed to 
me
by a multimedia start-up company because I was a fiction writer with an
interest in computers and digital media, not because I was a Kerouac 
fanatic.
Indeed, my not being a Kerouac fanatic was one reason I was considered a 
good
choice for the job, and one reason I took it. Having now spent a lot of 
time
looking into his life and career, I can report that I find Jack Kerouac to 
be a
fascinating man, a worthy, though wildly uneven, author, and without 
question a
problematic figure in almost every respect. <p>
 
<font size=5>K</font>EROUAC was born in 1922 into a French-Canadian 
working-class family in the
mill city of Lowell, Massachusetts, where his first language was a Canadian
dialect of French. He didn't speak English until he was six or seven years 
old.
Later in life he would cite the French mold of his mind to account for his
literary uniqueness, a claim more credible than many other claims he made 
about
himself. While growing up, he possessed a natural, nearly classical 
balance of
mind and body, and his destiny was influenced by the eventual loss of that
balance. A bookish, imaginative boy and a prep-school football star 
combined,
he won a <A 
HREF="http://www.charm.net/~brooklyn/Places/Columbia.html">sports 
scholarship to Columbia University</A> but broke his leg in one of
the first games of his freshman year and sat out the rest of the season. 
The
hiatus intensified a latent animosity between Kerouac and the Columbia 
football
coach, and the following year Kerouac, whose leg had fully healed, quit the
team. Though it was capricious and at least partly self-imposed, the end 
of his
formal athletic career was nonetheless a crucial factor in Kerouac's 
destiny,
because the inability to use his body in a publicly heroic way robbed him 
of
half his self-definition. <p>
 
He soon encountered <A 
HREF="http://www.charm.net/~brooklyn/People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen 
Ginsberg</A> and <A HREF="http://www.hyperreal.com/wsb/">William 
Burroughs</A> in New York, and
mental excitement came to dominate his life. He felt himself to be part of 
an
important artistic vanguard, and to fuel his intense immersions in the twin
landscapes of Manhattan and his imagination, he began to take large 
amounts of
Benzedrine, using the typical hipster technique of breaking open
over-the-counter nasal inhalers to get at the drug-soaked  inserts. While 
still
in his twenties he was hospitalized for serious phlebitis of the legs 
brought
on by that particular substance abuse. Many writers and artists have been
addicted to alcohol or drugs, but Kerouac underwent one of the more 
striking
personal deteriorations in the world of American literature, surpassing 
even
the decline of F. Scott Fitzgerald. The person he had been in college was
almost unrecognizable in the wreck he was by his early forties.<p>

Readers with a vague romantic notion of Kerouac as an artistic rebel and
hitchhiking hero of the open road will be surprised to learn that he had a
fragile, tenuous sense of his own identity. One of his most prescient
observations about himself comes early in <i>Selected Letters</i>. 
 Kerouac, twenty-one years old, was in a psychiatric unit undergoing
observation after refusing to take orders during his brief stint in the
Navy--an instance of his lifelong aversion to institutional authority. To 
his
boyhood friend George Apostolos, back in Lowell, he wrote, "It is the 
price I
pay for having a malleable personality. It assumes the necessary shape 
when in
contact with any other personality." Later in life his relationships with 
<A HREF="http://www.Charm.net/~brooklyn/People/NealCassady.html">Neal
Cassady</A>, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, and <A 
HREF="http://www.library.kent.edu/speccoll/poetry/snyder.html">Gary 
Snyder</A>  all reflected to
some degree his tendency to follow after and try to merge himself with 
people
he admired. Though he chose the "lonesome traveler" life, Kerouac did not 
like
to be alone. Yet nothing he did could repair his essential aloneness. He
yearned to publish his first novel, <i>The Town and the City</i>, but 
after he
did so, he wrote in a 1949 letter to the writer Alan Harrington,<p>
<blockquote>
I am no longer "beat," I have money, a career. I am more <i>alone </i>than 
when
I "lurked" on Times Square at 4 A.M., or hitch-hiked penniless down the
highways of the night. It's strange. And yet I was never a "rebel," only a
happy, sheepish imbecile, open-hearted &amp; silly with joys. And so I
<i>remain</i>. </blockquote><p>

<font size=5>M</font>ANY aspects of Kerouac's real life were obscured by 
his fame and are not
widely appreciated, including his intellectual seriousness as a young man 
and
his commitment to becoming an influential literary artist. Mark Van Doren, 
one
of his professors at Columbia, noticed Kerouac's literary bent and keen 
insight
into Shakespeare. In fact, it was Van Doren who recommended <i>The Town 
and the
City</i> to the publisher Robert Giroux. Kerouac had written this long,
rambling book in the late 1940s, while he was a member of the group that
included Burroughs and Ginsberg, but the novel was quite conventional, 
nearly a
homage to the literary hero of his youth, Thomas Wolfe. Even while writing
<i>The Town and the City</i>, Kerouac began to lose interest in that sort 
of
literature, and once the 1,000-page manuscript was out of his system, he 
began
to look for a new "method" of writing. <p>

Finding a way to release his authentic voice became the great artistic 
project
of Kerouac's life. In 1945, even before he began the first novel, he wrote 
to
Ginsberg, "Until I find a way to unleash the inner life in an art-method,
nothing about me will be clear." It would take Kerouac until the early 
1950s to
find that method--uncensored, improvisational "spontaneous prose," 
inspired by
his beloved bebop jazz. As he wrote to the critic and editor Malcolm 
Cowley:<p>
<blockquote>
The requirements for prose &amp; verse are the same, i.e. 
<i>blow</i>--What a
man most wishes to hide, revise, and un-say, is precisely what Literature 
is
waiting and bleeding for-- . . . .</blockquote>
<p>
Cowley got <i><A 
HREF="http://www.charm.net/~brooklyn/Books/OnTheRoad.html">On the 
Road</A></i> published in 1957, but he had been prepared to
champion it in 1953. <i>On the Road</i> wasn't published in 1953 simply 
because
Kerouac didn't believe in revision and refused to listen to Cowley's 
misgivings
about the novel's dramatic redundancy and lack of "control." And though 
Kerouac
understood that Cowley was asking him to "get it over the plate," he 
couldn't
respect the advice enough to take it. Ginsberg, who in 1953 was 
functioning as
a literary agent for both Kerouac and William Burroughs, also had 
misgivings
about Kerouac's self-indulgence in the manuscript, and called him a "holy 
fool"
for rejecting editors' opinions and thus keeping his books unpublished. 
Kerouac
was enraged by the criticism, and angrily broke with Ginsberg for a time
because of it. But two years later, in May of 1955, Kerouac wrote to 
Ginsberg,<p>
<blockquote>
Well today I wrapped up a 10,000 word short story called "cityCityCITY" and
sent it to Cowley asking him to figure someplace to send it and recommend 
it
too if he wants and suddenly in a P S I admitted I'd been a fool early 1953
refusing to publish ON THE ROAD with him. Allen do you realize if I had
published then, by now I'd have been in the money all this time, would have
traveled to Europe, Tangiers, and maybe India or even China and Japan and 
would
have probably published [the novel <i>Doctor Sax</i>] and also written 
great
new works obtaining from inspirations of travel. . . . Now I suppose 
Cowley may
laugh at me. . . . I suppose he figures I'm big underground martyr hero 
ready
to spend life unpublished like Grieg and Tashcaikowsky [sic], crying in the
dark.</blockquote> <p>

Had Kerouac been less arrogant with Cowley in 1953, he might have gained 
more
than just traveling money and new experiences. He might have had a 
different
destiny. For we see from his letters that Kerouac's addictive behavior
intensified most damagingly during those crucial years of disappointment 
and
rejection, and his social persona became brittle with the defensiveness and
guilt that ruined his friendships.<p>

Kerouac didn't deserve Truman Capote's famous dismissal to the effect that 
his
work wasn't writing but typing--or at least he didn't deserve to have the
remark stick the way it has. But clever putdowns tend to stick if there's 
any
truth in them at all, and it's simply true that Kerouac's theory of 
spontaneous
prose is often easier to respect than his practice of it. Kerouac did not
believe that just any sort of "automatic" writing was automatically 
literature.
He thought that the making of true spontaneous prose was more difficult and
demanding than ordinary writing accomplished through a process of revision.
Like a jazz musician or a silk painter, the true spontaneous-prose artist 
had
to be utterly "present" during the act of creation, completely in the 
moment,
and had only one chance to get it right. Kerouac saw writing as a 
performing
art, and a grueling one, requiring arduous compositional marathons and 
habits
of mind cultivated by long practice. Having had his athletic career cut 
short,
he pursued writing in an athletic way, often spending twelve or more hours
nonstop at the typewriter, using long rolls of teletype paper so that he 
could
write uninterrupted.<p>

Like any athlete or performer, he would have on days and off days, and the
trick was to maximize the on days. Most writers deny that they have ever
written a single word in any condition other than stone-cold sobriety. At 
least
some of them are lying. Kerouac always admitted that he wrote while he was
high. <i>Selected Letters</i> confirms that he rarely wrote fiction 
<i>except
</i>under the influence of one substance or another--Benzedrine, 
marijuana, or
alcohol in his early years, mostly alcohol later on. For Kerouac, literal
intoxication provided both the physical rush that propelled him through his
long writing sessions and the freedom from his censorious self--his
internalization of his clannish, Old World family and particularly of his
mother, the ever-present "M&eacute;m&egrave;re."<p>

Before substance abuse destroyed Kerouac's body, it disfigured his 
undeniable
literary talent by fueling a growing delusion that anything he composed 
during
his orgiastic pleasure trips at the typewriter was worth the attention of 
the
reading public. His writing often gleams with sharp turns of phrase, 
off-kilter
perceptions, and the well-remembered detail of strange adventures, but 
just as
often it devolves into a shaggy-dog story. Since subjecting his work to
revision would damage its authenticity, it went out the way it was. 
Naturally,
editors kept rejecting it with lectures about "craft" that infuriated 
Kerouac,
who would then go drink some more and take it out on the typewriter 
again.<p>

It's particularly ironic, therefore, that the book we know as <i>On the
Road</i>, Kerouac's most famous and most accomplished work, wasn't written
"spontaneously." Renditions of the Kerouac myth rarely mention that 
although he
did write the original version of <i>On the Road </i>in one burst on his
legendary teletype paper rolls, he re-wrote and recast it many times in the
seven or eight years before it was published.<p>

<font size=5>K</font>EROUAC couldn't have wished for a better editor than 
his fiction and letters
have now found in Ann Charters, who also published the first--and still the
most widely read--biography of him in 1973, only four years after his 
death.
Charters once worked closely with Kerouac, in 1966, when she was preparing 
the
first annotated bibliography of his work. She knows the material as well as
anybody, yet she possesses a scholarly detachment that is absent in most
Kerouac fans. <i>The Portable Kerouac </i>is without question the single 
best
introduction to his work. For those already familiar with some of Kerouac's
books and interested in the man who wrote them, <i>Selected Letters:
1940-1956</i>, arranged chronologically with headnotes by Charters, will 
be a
revelation.<p>
<i> The Portable </i>confers upon Kerouac the literary legitimacy he so 
craved. (He thought
that a Viking Portable edition of his work would be a grand idea, and 
mentioned
it to friends a number of times.) It does not fulfill his ultimate 
publishing
fantasy, however: a uniform edition of all his mature work, to be issued 
as The
Duluoz Legend. That title is drawn from the name Jack Duluoz--Kerouac's
preferred pseudonym, though he did not use it in <i>On the Road</i>, 
<i>The 
Dharma Bums</i>
(1958),or <i>The Subterraneans</i> (1958),his three best-known books. As 
he wrote in
the introduction to <i>Big Sur</i> (1962), "My work comprises one vast 
book like
Proust's except that my remembrances are written on the run instead of
afterwards in a sick bed."
</a></h1>
He says "remembrances" not only to echo Proust but also because early in 
his
career Kerouac had ceased to think of himself as a fiction writer per se. 
In
1950 he wrote to Neal Cassady, "I have renounced fiction and fear. There is
nothing to do but write the truth. There is no other reason to write." Like
prose that had been subjected to revision, invented characters and drama 
seemed
inauthentic to Kerouac. And so he wrote what he called "true story
novels"--books in which the events had really happened to real people. For
legal reasons Kerouac's many publishers insisted on a variety of name 
changes,
along with altered geography and character traits. Thus William Burroughs
appears as Old Bull Lee in <i>On the Road</i>, Frank Carmody in <i>The
Subterraneans</i>, Bull Hubbard in <i>Desolation Angels</i> (1965), and so 
on.
The real-life events of <i>The Subterraneans</i> occurred in New York, but 
the
book is set in San Francisco.<p>

However, <i>The Portable</i>'s bird's-eye view of Kerouac's career belies
rather than affirms the claim that he wrote "one vast book." His novels 
don't
even come close to working as a unified project, and the comparison to 
Proust
must be seen as wishful thinking, or grandiose boast, or just plain 
delusion.
Kerouac was simply not disciplined enough to execute the grand scheme of a
multi-volume work of fictional memoir that coherently depicted an artist's
entire life.<p>
<font size=5>T</font>HOUGH Kerouac always retained the ambition to work 
with the large canvas of
America as a whole, he was a thoroughly apolitical person. His model of 
social
reality was the family--his literal family, with whom he lived at least 
half of
every year, or various substitutes for it. Over and over in his letters we 
see
him fantasizing about some communal venture with his friends, some way of
creating a new familial situation for himself, though he walked out of two
marriages because he found them confining. He repeatedly proposed the idea 
of a
working farm or ranch to Neal and Carolyn Cassady, and in 1956, when 
Buddhism
was his passion and the poet Gary Snyder was his friend, the two men talked
about founding a monastery, or "zendo," where American "bhikkus" (wandering
monks) could stay--conversations dramatized in the novel <i>The Dharma
Bums</i>. But these were always esoteric collectives in Kerouac's
mind--families as clannish as his real family, havens for the initiated, 
not
brotherhoods open to just anyone. Kerouac deplored it when the life led by
Snyder and friends in California's Marin County in the mid-1950s, a life
rhapsodized in <i>The Dharma Bums</i>, became the mass phenomenon of the
counterculture in the 1960s.<p>
And Kerouac was most certainly not ready to meet society as a whole when it
turned collectively to peer at him. After wishing so hard for fame, and
enduring nearly a decade of publishers' rejections, he became famous 
overnight
on September 5, 1957, when Gilbert Millstein, of <i>The New York 
Times</i>,<i>
</i>greeted <i>On the Road </i>with a rave review. A "major novel," 
Millstein
called it, "the most beautifully executed, the clearest and most important
utterance yet made by the generation Kerouac himself named years ago as 
'beat,'
and whose principal avatar he is." Millstein predicted Kerouac's place in
literary history by writing, "Just as, more than any other novel of the
Twenties, <i>The Sun Also Rises </i>came to be regarded as the testament 
of the
Lost Generation, so it seems certain that <i>On the Road </i>will come to 
be
known as that of the Beat Generation."<p>

Millstein had previously given attention to Beat writing in <i>The New York
Times</i>, and he was known to be sympathetic. Few other reviews of <i>On 
the
Road </i>welcomed it in such glowing terms. Indeed, a few days later the 
Sunday
<i>New York Times </i>ran another review of the novel, by David Dempsey, 
that
took a much different tone. Dempsey acknowledged that the book was good
storytelling, but he was scandalized by Kerouac's failure to take a moral
position on the drug use, casual sex, and general outlaw attitude of the
marginal characters depicted in the book. Some reviewers compared the novel
favorably to the work of well-known writers as disparate as Wolfe, 
Whitman, and
Henry Miller, but many commentators thought it encouraged corrupt, depraved
behavior among the restless young.<p>

Kerouac always embodied profound contradictions, and his sense of his own 
work
was no exception. He knew perfectly well that <i>On the Road</i>'s subject
matter--the underground life of hip wanderers--would be its appeal to the
public, but he seems not to have anticipated any moral controversy, or 
that the
mass media would seize upon him personally as "King of the Beats." In 
terms of
personal morality, Kerouac was a rather old-fashioned man who loved wine,
women, and song, and sometimes carried prayer cards in his wallet. He knew 
he
was the hitchhiking stranger looking into middle-class homes lit by blue TV
light, yet he was deeply sentimental about family, and somehow failed to 
grasp
just how far his daily life had drifted from typical middle-class American
experience.<p>

The public controversy boosted book sales even as it turned Kerouac's fame 
into
infamy, and soon he had become the last thing he was prepared to be: the 
public
spokesman for the Beat Generation. As an artist, he didn't want to be part 
of a
mass phenomenon--he wanted to be special. He wanted to be seen as a great
writer, not as the cartoon embodiment of a rebel generation out for kicks,
though he fed that image with cocky behavior and drinking binges. He wasn't
king of anything, and he knew it, but he didn't know how to say no to all 
the
people who wanted to get drunk or stoned or into bed with the hippest 
writer
around, the one-man wild party. Perhaps worst of all, Kerouac was not 
prepared
to see the literary establishment echo the fear and ridicule of the popular
press; most highbrow journals dismissed both his prose and his subject 
matter,
dashing his dream of legitimized artistic glory.<p>

<i>The Portable </i>and <i>Selected Letters </i>show that had Kerouac 
possessed
more self-confidence and character, had he not been so terribly weak in the
flesh, he might have left behind an unassailably great body of work. 
Without
question he had the mysterious combination of qualities it takes to make an
important writer. He was enormously, and strangely, talented. He wrote the
original draft of <i>On the Road </i>in a week, <i>The Dharma Bums </i>in
twelve days, <i>The Subterraneans </i>in three --that last an achievement 
that
staggered even Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs, themselves no 
strangers to
orgiastic writing sessions. His gushed, spouted, roman-candle novels have
reached many people and been admired for many years.<p>

But like good intentions, being talented and even reaching many people 
aren't
everything. F. Scott Fitzgerald, to take that example again, was a far more
disciplined artist than Kerouac, infinitely more confident of himself in
general society, yet he was gone at the age of forty-four, three years shy 
of
<A HREF="http://www.orci.com/personal/jim/pictures/kerouac.html">Kerouac's 
ripe old forty-seven</A>. If you really want to write, or to create any
art, booze and dope will mess you up, though they might provide energy and
inspiration at first. Running from your own identity will mess you up too, 
as
will the attempt to meld yourself with every strong personality you
encounter--another problem Fitzgerald and Kerouac shared. In the end, no 
matter
how we read Jack Kerouac's work, we read his life as a cautionary tale.

 <font size=5>S</font>ITTING in the sun and the breeze on the deck of a hotel barge, midway between

a good lunch and a good dinner, with a book and a glass of cold Diet Coke?

Evian? wine? on the table before you as you survey the scene, you wave hello to

an old <i>paysan</i> fishing on the green bank of the canal, admire a pair of

swans swimming, and chuckle fondly at a children's kayaking class--could there

be any more idyllic way to see France? You've spent the morning tramping around

historic sites, and soon the barge will be tying up at a little town where you

can go for a walk and buy an ice cream or a newspaper.<p>

Last summer I spent six days floating through the Champagne region on a barge

named the <i>Esprit</i>, as a guest of its owners, <A HREF="http://www.aboveall.com/fc/FCMAIN.html">French Country Waterways</A>,

and I was intrigued to note that it seemed to be just a few inches narrower

than the locks through which we passed several times a day on canals and

rivers. The <i>Esprit</i>, like most of the dozens of hotel barges plying their

trade in various regions of France, has been retrofitted with heating and

air-conditioning, guest cabins (the <i>Esprit</i>'s are very clean and

comfortable, though far from sybaritic), a dining room, a bar and lounge, and,

out on deck, patio chairs, pots of geraniums, and a rack of bicycles.<p>



Every other mode of transportation within France has limitations and

disadvantages vis-&agrave;-vis barging. If you restrict yourself to planes and

taxis, you are in effect turning your back on the lovely countryside. If you

travel by train, you'll have to keep shlepping your bags from the station to

the hotel and back. Rent a car and you'll not only have to keep packing and

unpacking but also have to drive. Bicycling, too, presents the packing and

unpacking problem, and it's a lot of work besides. A cruise ship will limit you

to major ports on major waterways. Hotel-barge travel tends to be priced

comparably to cruise travel in a nice cabin on a nice ship: about $300 to $500

per person per day, including all excursions, cocktails, meals, and wine. Then

again, it is possible to rent a do-it-yourself barge quite inexpensively--say,

$1,000 a week for a barge that sleeps four--although doing so will not make for

a logistically simple trip. The difference is like that between a good hotel

and a rental condo--except, of course, that you never have to pilot a condo or

learn the drill for maneuvering it through locks. Because Europe's waterways

are mostly ancient (some of the canals date back to the Romans), barging offers

one other, minor advantage I hadn't expected: often towns, and grand old

buildings, face the water, not the highway.<p>



Many of the barges that now carry travelers once carried freight, but this mode

of transportation is no longer particularly economical for hauling commodities

around Europe, and an abundance of barges are available for sale cheap. What's

more, the pool of travelers whose thinking runs along the same lines as mine is

ever widening. Thus hotel barges are a growth industry. I can't prove it, but

seemingly so are houseboats. In Paris on the Seine, or in any of the towns

where the hotel barges visit, you'll see snug vessels tied up along the quays

or the banks, with jungles of houseplants and chic natural-canvas umbrellas on

deck. These tend to be owned by French people or foreign retirees, and the

owners have tales to tell about their journeys as far afield as Belgium and

Germany: continental Europe altogether has more than 6,000 miles of navigable

inland waterways.<p>

The hotel barges are for the most part booked and crewed by Americans and

English people. On my trip last summer all thirteen guests were American (the

<i>Esprit</i>, which is relatively big for a hotel barge, has space for

eighteen guests; some others accommodate no more than six or eight). Five of

the six crew members were young and English; the sixth, Sondrine, was young and

French. They provided lovely service. One guest couple, evidently more

accustomed to five-star hotels than most of us, found their attitude too

informal. The couple were displeased, for example, that the crew rarely called

us by name. But I was happy not to get responses like "I'm afraid the captain

is unavailable just now, Ms. Wallraff." I was told instead, "Ian is showering.

Would you like me to give him a message?" In general the effect was of

friendly, natural, well-spoken young people doing everything they could think

of to please us--and being happy to do it. Every now and then, while we were

sitting at dinner, we'd hear the crew burst into song out in the galley. They

had perhaps been nipping at what was left of the good wine they'd served us the

day before. (The company says that leftover wine and food are given to

lockkeepers along the route.) <p>

<br>





<font size=5>A</font>H, the wine. And the cheese. At every lunch and every dinner we were

served a good French red wine and a good French white, and at the end of the

meal a tray of three cheeses was presented. No wine or cheese ever repeated,

and each was introduced, or explained, by a member of the crew: where it was

from, what the history of its name was, and so on. We all came to look forward

to the droll "cheese chats," as the crew called them; we began to call them

"cats <i>du fromage</i>." The majority of the wine was from premier- and

grand-cru vineyards: better stuff than most of us would order for ourselves day

in and day out--especially in France, where a fairly ordinary bottle in a

restaurant can easily run to $40. And in a restaurant if you wanted just one

more taste of the red to go with your cheese, you'd never call for another

bottle. But on the <i>Esprit</i>, whenever anyone wanted, another was

cheerfully brought to the table. <p>



Each morning one of the crew went into town to buy bread and an assortment of

treats from the best local bakery, and these baked goods, along with cereal,

yogurt, fresh fruit, juice, and coffee, made up our breakfast buffet. As for

lunch and dinner, I freely admit that we were in the care of an English chef.

Ours was a live-wire kid with stiff dyed-blond hair and pants patterned with

black-and-white checks the size of floor tiles, and also a kid who knew his way

around a galley and knew how to set off to advantage the wonderful local

ingredients--mache and morels, raspberries and Charentais melon, locally cured

ham and foie gras.<p>

<br>



<font size=5>A</font> HOTEL barge offers the traveler France lite. You don't have to eat dinner

at eight-thirty or nine to show that you're not some hick foreigner who doesn't

know any better: dinner is served at seven-thirty. You don't have to struggle

to make yourself understood: the crew speak English as well as French. You've

already paid, and so you don't have to keep shelling out francs, day by day,

hour by hour. You don't have to puzzle over maps and menus and wine lists. You

don't, frankly, have to lift a finger.<p>



<img src="./balloon.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="" border=0>



If, reading this, you are appalled at how much of the "real" France the barge

traveler I am describing is missing, you might be a good candidate for renting

your own barge--what hotel-barge travelers are in the midst of, after all, is

about as real as France gets. You can indeed rent a barge that comes with no

crew whatsoever, and what you'll need to know to get through the locks and so

on is not too ambitious for adventurous people to learn on vacation. The way to

take such a trip, I found from talking to those who have done it, is to plan

fanatically; to travel as a group of at least four, including some stouthearted

persons who won't mind the manual labor involved in getting through the locks;

and to rent a car as well, tailing the barge in it in order to have it

available for sightseeing excursions and food shopping.<p>



Be that as it may, the owners of the hotel barges work diligently to get their

guests out into France. A large, very comfortable motor coach traveled with the

<i>Esprit</i>, sometimes following us or sneaking off to do errands while we

all cruised, and sometimes carrying us to see the cathedral at Rheims, or to

visit the tiny, family-owned Ployez-Jacquemart champagne vineyard and taste its

goods, or to tour the Belleau Woods battlefield, cemetery, and memorial from

the First World War, or to attend a beautiful private dinner at the abbey where

Dom Perignon lived and worked in the seventeenth and early eighteenth

centuries.<p>



When there's nothing planned, you can concoct your own adventure if you like:

the barge must stop frequently at locks, and whenever it does, you're free to

hop off, perhaps taking a sturdy, balloon-tired bike with you. ("Hop" is the

word: the barge is stationary and more or less level with the bank for only a

few moments.) The barge often moves at no more than a walking pace, so where

there's a towpath you may walk instead if you like. The crew know which

stretches of the trip are best for bicycling, and one day we asked them to put

up a picnic for six of us. They packed the food on the carriers behind the

seats of six bikes, and then handed the bikes ashore at a lock we reached

shortly before lunchtime. We pedaled madly uphill for a half hour or so in the

heat, wondering if this had been such a good idea. And then the land smoothed

out and opened up, and we were coasting past vineyards and red poppies and

wheat and brilliant-yellow fields of canola. It wasn't long before we found

ourselves in a village, back by the river, at a picnic table in a park under

huge old trees. We waved as the barge came past, leisurely finished our meal,

and tidied up the empty food containers to please those dears on the crew--and

then we pedaled madly again to get to the next lock on time.<p>



Often hotel-barge trips offer an optional hot-air-balloon excursion, and the

combination is an inspired one: the barge tends to follow the lowest contours

on the landscape, whereas the balloon lofts you above it. A basketload of five

of us soared up from a high school soccer field one morning in the care of

Vincent Dupuis, with whom French Country Waterways makes it a point to work,

because he is a personable, English-speaking former world ballooning champion

with an excellent safety record (his company's name is Air Adventures). As we

glided along above the villages, dogs barked, cats ran, cows gaped, and plump

farmwives flung open their shutters, looked up, and called to their husbands

and children to come see. "<i>&Ccedil;a va?</i>" Vincent would call down to

them, and we would all wave. We flitted around for an hour or so and then

Vincent began looking for a place to land. Early to mid summer is the hardest

time of year to find a good spot, he explained, because in every field is

growing something a farmer values. Sure enough, outside the towns little but

the river and a quilt of bounteous agriculture was to be seen anywhere beneath

us. At last we set down, <i>very</i> carefully, on a six-foot-wide dirt road

between a field of tall wheat and a field of oats, and immediately the farmer

who owned the field came driving out in his truck, with his dog, to have a look

around. Vincent invited the man to join us for croissants, coffee, and

champagne--a breakfast his assistant whisked from the van in which he had been

following us all the while.<p>

<br>



 <font size=5>A</font>NY kind of barge trip takes some thoughtful planning. The hotel-barge

industry is tiny, and its "product" is not yet a commodity in the way that,

say, Caribbean cruises are: even in the same barge on the same route no two

barge cruises will be alike. Obviously, the region a given barge travels

through is an important consideration when you're choosing a trip to take.

(Down the Loire and on the Sa&ocirc;ne and the canals of Burgundy in September,

when the vineyards are harvesting their grapes, are the classic routes, and the

ones that sell out first.) The size of the barge--how many passengers it

carries--will also affect how you experience your trip. In fact, the passengers

themselves will be crucial to your experience, so it's not a bad idea to quiz

someone from the barge company about the others who have reservations on a trip

you are interested in. Do make sure that, for example, on an eight-person barge

the other people aren't all old friends traveling together. Also while deciding

what to book, make your priorities known. Are you most interested in an

itinerary that includes many historic sites? In having a spacious cabin? In

exploring the region's food and wine?<p>



This year French Country Waterways (800-222-1236) has deployed all four of its

barges, including the <i>Esprit</i>, in Burgundy. Other companies continue to

offer itineraries in Champagne, and in Alsace-Lorraine, Brittany, and the

south. There are, as well, owner-operated barges that are not part of any

larger company, and these often allow you to customize your itinerary,

excursions, and menu, but they are usually available by charter only, so this

option is for the most part practical only if you can assemble a traveling

party of at least five or six. Information about these barges, and about the

do-it-yourself ones, can be found in the Yacht Charter Guide, which many travel

agents have. Or you can call the French Government Tourist Office

(900-990-0040; there's a charge of fifty cents a minute) and ask to be sent its

list of barge operators.<p>



Although it wouldn't be especially helpful for choosing a barge (its list of

operators is sorely wanting), <i>Waterways of Europe</i>, in the Insight

guidebook series, is full of lovely photographs and is useful for background. I

found a copy in the library on board the <i>Esprit</i>. It was a good choice

one afternoon to carry into the sun and the breeze on deck, to flip through

idly while I waited for another <i>paysan</i> with a fishing pole to appear

round the bend.

	</pre>
	
	<font size=5>F</font>LYING IN: Beneath the jet wing and still night, the candlepower of
civilization outlines the graceful littoral of Israel. The long Mediterranean
becomes unexpectedly Oriental here; a dark-eyed astonishment in the land of
tents and tabernacles, unbiblical cement factories and atomic-reactor
aspirations, Marc Chagall tribal windows and the ingathered tribes themselves.
A single star climbs into view as the plane begins its slow descent. It shines
across the Mandelbaum Gate: a star of David, a star for Bethlehem. Without
visa.<p>

<p>

Wrecks: From Lydda the roadway winds through villages and new forests to
Jerusalem, over ground that has known the heels and chariots of legions and
crusades, worshippers of conquest and zealots of flame and sun, man and book.
You can pick a ruin or a war--and often find one piled upon another. In the
Arab village of Abu Ghosh, a crusader monastery is built upon the foundations
of a Roman structure which contains a stone inscription: Vexillatio Leg(ionis)
Fre(tensis)--Detachment of the Fretensis Legion. And both are on the site of
biblical Kiryat Ye'arim, where the holy ark rested before being taken to
Jerusalem by King David.<p>

<p>

But no guidebook or scholarship is required to identify the wrecks of rusting,
stripped passenger cars. The first one seen in a ravine along the highway looks
as if it ran off the road. Where the highway curves closer to the boundary of
Jordan, more dead vehicles appear. Some are strewn with withered wreaths and
dried flowers, and suddenly the meaning of the wrecks becomes clear. These are
memorials--cars killed in action, pockmarked by bullet holes. They rest as
tributes to the members of the convoys that brought relief to beleaguered
Jerusalem during Israel's war of independence.<p>

<p>

And a reminder that the threat of ambush is never further than the artificial
boundaries. At the same time one looks at the cars of 1948, one hears on the
radio of a border incursion in the north that takes the life of a tractor
driver of 1966.<p>

<p>

<p>

FINK'S: In the night country of new Jerusalem, there is a Chinese, an Italian,
authentic (Oriental) Israeli, and even kosher restaurants. Then there is
Fink's, a night place containing little more than a darkened bar, a handful of
tables, some posters, and Air France ashtrays. Like Costello's on Third Avenue
or Gilhuly's on Eighth in Manhattan, it is plain, but its reputation is built
on the fact that everybody goes there, messages can be left, the mustached
proprietor keeps his counsel and knows more than he says. The beer and booze
flow till the small hours. In short, Fink's is an authentic Irish bar on, of
all places, Rehov Hamelech George (King George Street). That is why the
specialties of the house are Hungarian goulash and conversation. The latter is
endless, the former comes in a beer stein, thick and nourishing.<p>

<p>

After much wine, two middle aged men came around to the question of
prostitution. One said "There used to be an old bag who patrolled near Fink's,
but she disappeared last year." The second said, "I hear there are call girls
in Tel Aviv." The first said, "She was the only one in all Jerusalem." The
second said, "In the old days them were priestesses." The first said "In the
ideal state, would or would not prostitutes exist?" The second said, "Does a
democratic state have more or less than a religious state?"<p>

<p>

The proprietor of Fink's cleaned out the Air France ashtrays, served up two
more glasses of wine, and, saying nothing, looked wise.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

THOSE OTHERS: Put two Jews on a desert island, the old story goes: the first
will build an Orthodox and the second a Reform temple. Arguments abound,
debates flourish, democracy gets noisy. There is no one voice in Israel, and
surely no one city.<p>

<p>

"I can always tell someone from Tel Aviv on a street here," says the lady from
Jerusalem. "They have a certain way about them--they're garish, a little loud,
and act superior."<p>

<p>

Her companion agrees, attributing the Tel Aviv manner to a preoccupation with
refrigerators, tourists, and pursuit of the high life. "I'm against that big
new swimming pool there," he says, "and do you know what they've now got on
Dizengoff Street? A pizza place! And how does one say pizza in Hebrew? "Pizza,"
he replies, gloomily. <p>

<p>

Anyway, the lady from Jerusalem who sounds exactly like the lady from Westport
talking about the lady from Great Neck, can't say one thing about those others
from Tel Aviv: "They look so Jewish."<p>

<p>

<p>

ARABS AND PENS: Toward the Arabs who remained in the Jewish state there is a
general air of respect and an attitude frequently heard: "They never had it so
good." Toward the Palestine Arabs who chose to leave and live year after year
in displaced persons camps, there is a feeling of sympathetic regret, to which
is added: "They are valuable to the Arab governments as propaganda." And toward
the Arabs themselves in nearby lands, there is a mixture of fear and
neighborliness--of being faced with the same hot winds and water shortages in
the same Oriental boat.<p>

<p>

But toward the Arabian oil potentates there is contempt. When the former King
of Egypt died of gluttony the vast distance between the Arab royalty and the
people seemed underscored once again. And the stories circulated about the rich
and wily rulers and their symbol of education and power, Parker pens.<p>

<p>

There was the Persian Gulf oil ruler who wore his Parkers on the outside of his
garment and served tea inside his Rolls-Royce; its interior had been completely
removed and turned into a status tea wagon on the sands. An importer in Persia
placed an order for 20,000 Parker caps--only. Since the people who bought them
couldn't write, all they required was the pen top to clip on their robes.<p>

<p>

And then there was the Arab ruler who drove up in his bulletproofed,
air-conditioned Cadillac to sign a formal treaty giving away certain oil rights
in a region hard by the Gulf of Aden. He pulled his Parker pen (one of three)
out of his vest, squirted some ink on his right thumb, and with a flourish, put
his "signature" on the agreement.<p>

<p>

<p>

VOLKS AND BENZ: The personal automobile is still something of a luxury. There
are, after all, no oil sheikhs here. American economy and compact cars are
popular; some that are small on U.S. highways take on a limousine, vintage look
on these narrow roads. Small French cars suit tastes; but then so do French
jets in the Israeli Air Force. Every vehicle's whereabouts is known, not so
much to satisfy traffic departments as for defense needs; they can be
commandeered almost instantly.<p>

<p>

The Volkswagen and the Mercedes-Benz are perhaps the most telling symbols of
automobile ambivalence. The little one was once touted as the Third Reich's
people's car; the big one rolled the Fuhrer and his friends down the autobahns
of long-remembered newsreels. Realpolitik and reparations and West German
recognition all no doubt are balanced before entering the "authorized
Volkswagen agency" in Tel Aviv. As for the Mercedes-Benz, the two seen on the
street both had their triangular symbols above the hood taken off, or knocked
off.<p>

<p>

But the real sign of the times is the parking meters in new Jerusalem (none
have as yet been installed in the old city).<p>

<p>

<p>

AMERICANS: The David and Goliath aspects of the 1948 war of independence
attracted help from all over the world, including the United States. Some
Americans here still had some fight in them at the end of the Second World War
and lent their talents to the new state.<p>

<p>

"I remember running into some members of the Jewish brigade who were in the
British Eighth Army in Italy," one said. "They knew then that they were going
to make a bid for Palestine. They used to kid: The Second World War is just a
warm-up for us--we're learning how to use the weapons and battle tactics for a
little war of our own coming up. I decided to join them "<p>

"I was a fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Corps," another said, "and believe it or
not, I had never heard of concentration camps until the end of the war. I was
so angry that I used to ride the subways wearing a Star of David, waiting for
someone to glare at me--anyone--so I could punch him in the nose. When the 1948
war started, I helped to recruit fliers and navigators. How? I combed the list
of DFC winners in the newspapers and called up the Greenbergs and Cohens and
asked them if they wanted to join up. Some in turn recruited their old
crews."<p>

<p>

"If I never do another thing of value in my life," said a third American, "I'll
be able to point to my gunrunning days and getting ships to bring in illegal
immigrants past the blockade. Now I return every few years and look at the
settlements and see the children of the broken people we rescued. Some of us
risked our lives and our citizenship at the time. We haven't any honorable
discharge papers to show.<p>

<p>

Only a feeling of having done something in the right place at the right time."
<p>

<p>

<p>

ORTHODOXY: Over cups of Turkish coffee and glasses of tea, Israelis debate the
nature of religious observance in this only halfhearted "Jewish state."
Ironically, the ways of the ghetto are preserved voluntarily, even
ecstatically, in Mea Shearim, the Hasidic area of Jerusalem. The markets are
colorful and private, the attire is black and formal for men, wigged and drab
for women, and covered for youngsters. If a car appears here on the Sabbath, it
may be stoned.<p>

<p>

The non-Orthodox Israelis are of two minds about the fanatical religious Jews.
The intolerant regard them with contempt. One main reason is that most of the
Hasidic sect did not play a fighting role in the war of independence. Despite
conscription, which places young men and women in uniform at about eighteen,
members of the Hasidic sect can claim an exemption from service on religious
grounds. And the ways of the ghetto clash with those of the independent-minded,
worldly sabra or of the people who fought for Israel's creation. The more
tolerant regard the Hasidic sect as an ancient symbol of the continuity of
Judaism. They feel that religion was the original cement which held the Jewish
community together long before a state was dreamed of, and that regardless of
which party attains governmental power, the people of Israel must remain people
of the Book.<p>

<p>

<p>

Art and Artillery: The Shrine of the Book, which houses the Dead Sea Scrolls,
is in The Israel Museum (the only general art museum between Athens and Tokyo)
and was designed by the American architects Kiesler and Bartos. It is shaped
like the top of the jar in which the scrolls were saved, and is entered as if
it were the cave where they were found. The shrine contains Israel's most
precious historical reminder, a twenty-three-foot Isaiah scroll. It is mounted
on a drum, resembling a Torah handle, which can be lowered underground
electrically--for this museum is within Arab artillery range.<p>

<p>

But the museum's real distinction is its location. At the foot of the museum
hill is a Byzantine church encircled by a crusader wall; it is called the
Monastery of the Cross because this is said to be the site of the tree from
which the Cross was fashioned. In a surrounding field Ruth gleaned after the
reapers of Boaz. To the north is a former campsite of the vaunted Roman Tenth
Legion. And around the museum 120 newly planted olive trees struggle for life
in the soil, "because this was an olive grove in the time of David."<p>

<p>

A few miles away at Ramat Rahel, two Jordanian riflemen train their binoculars
this way from their sandbagged building, their guns at the ready, behind barbed
wire, a rusty crop among the peaceful olive leaves.<p>

<p>

<p>

NEW IMAGE: The cold war between Israel and its neighbors has as its prize not
territory but tourists. Not having their own, Americans admire antiquities; one
country's ruins are another's relics. Egypt points to Abu Simbel and the
pyramids (and the Jews, half in jest, say that their slave ancestors put up
buildings for the pharaohs that really lasted). Jordan advertises itself as
"the Holy Land," carefully avoiding any reference to the Bible. And Israel for
a long time emphasized that it was the "Land of the Bible."<p>

<p>

Now that image is being revised and the slogan changed. The assumption is that
religious sentiment will bring a steady flow of people here ("Next year in
Jerusalem" is an ancient injunction) anyway. So the new slogan is "Land of Sun
and Fun."<p>

<p>

A couple of PR men (unashamedly calling themselves such) sat around sipping
their arrack, the local spirit, and dreaming martini dreams. Finally one
swinger declared, "I've got it! We run a grand prix here with all the
international racing-car types. From Dan to Eilat. Everybody shows up--the
Klosters crowd, the Costa Brava beautiful people, the literary snobs from
Tangier, the broken-down royalty. We'll do for Israel what Bardot did for St.
Tropez and Kelly for Monaco. There's this sabra driver at the wheel who comes
from behind, puts on the heat, and wins because he has to get home before
sundown on Friday. He gets first prize--ex-Queen Soraya. They go off into the
sunset and live happily ever after as kibbutzniks." He closed his eyes. "We'll
be so in," he said, "they'll come in droves."<p>

<p>

<p>

HOBBY: Israel's national sport is archaeology. The coveted skeletons in the
country's closet are walls, pottery, flints, coins, scrolls, bones. But the
real search is for the bits and marks of civilization and intelligence; the
by-products become pride in the historical continuity of the past and possibly
a clue to philosophical behavior for the present.<p>

<p>

The roads of the desert and the ways of survival in the past have practical
value. Once, in the Sinai campaign, a correspondent asked an Israeli general
where he drew his battle plans from. The general pointed to his copy of the Old
Testament and answered, "Here."<p>

<p>

Today, as the Jewish and Roman memorabilia are excavated, imprinted in the
mosaic floors and walls of synagogues and churches are such familiar phrases as
"In memory of..." and "Donated by..." and "A generous gift of...." No
"Anonymous" or "Gift of a Friend" has been dug up yet. The ancients who built
here, says a museum curator, wanted to perpetuate their names just as most of
their modern UJA counterparts.<p>

<p>

<p>

TO THE SIX MILLION: On a spur in the Judean hills, Yad Vashem (the Martyrs and
Heroes Remembrance Authority) has built a rugged shrine to the victims of the
concentration camps. Walkways of trees, planted in dedication, are labeled: to
twenty partisans of Holland, to a French underground unit, to individuals who
resisted or could not. There is no division here between the terror and the
banality of evil.<p>

<p>

Above the old Arab villages and replanted green slopes, the shrine gives the
impression of an air raid bunker, or a prison. It is built of rust-colored
boulders from the volcanic hills above the Sea of Galilee. Sculptured iron
splinters form a motif of barbed-wire thorns at the entranceway. Inside there
is a dark silence and panels on the floor, each branded with the name of a
concentration camp: Dachau, Auschwitz, Treblinka, Babi Yar. The names are
enough; imagination does the rest. In a corner is a flickering gas flame. Is it
a reminder of the ovens of death? No, it is an eternal flame.<p>

<p>

A guide explains the meaning to a Negro from a new Congo republic, who replies
in English, "I shall remember to tell my people."<p>

<p>

In an adjoining area, there are mementos of the Warsaw uprising, anti-Jewish
posters, photographs of book-burnings, yellow stars of shame overprinted "Juif"
or "Jude." Swastikas are gone in the world; the six-pointed stars survive.<p>

<p>

FLYING OUT: At the airport in Lydda, the pilot of El Al, the government
airline, carries himself with the universal air of assurance of all
four-stripers on all airlines. The tourists jam the last-minute souvenirs into
flight bags--playing cards with biblical characters for kings and queens,
candelabra, homegrown liqueurs from Mount Carmel, scrolls as door signposts
inlaid with stones from King Solomon's mines. The familiar El Al gags are
repeated; the hostess walking down the aisle and saying, "Have a piece Of
fruit"; the voice on the runway warning, "Fasten your seat belts, please, my
son, the pilot, is ready to take off."<p>

<p>

But you do look closely at the wings worn by the hostess and captain as they
board the aircraft. In the center of their wings, embroidered in gold, is a
yellow six-pointed star. By contrast, it is suddenly a symbol of defiance and
pride. The jet lifts off and begins its journey  westward from the state of
mind and the new city of Jerusalem.

	<font size=5>A</font>nything written about the effect of money on life in the United States ought

to be in the past tense. There was a time, that is, when money really meant

something. A dollar was not an infinitesimal sum; neither was a nickel. One

recalls a reverse-English witticism, "It's only money," which was mentioned

when a price seemed exorbitant, and which might even get a laugh from those who

hadn't heard it before. But nowadays, the same line would be played straight,

and all within hearing would amiably concur: it's only money, and what it will

buy is very little indeed.<p>



<p>



To begin thinking about prices as, for example, they stood at the beginning of

World War I is to be overwhelmed by reminders of what a dollar used to do for

its owner. Many daily papers cost a cent, and a nickel on Sunday, and home

delivery to the subscriber was a matter of about $5.00 a year for what costs

today just nine times as much. As a schoolboy I used to lodge at the McAlpin

when I was hard up, in a comfortable room, well kept, for $2.00 a day, and when

in funds, at the Waldorf, a block away, for $3.50. The Ritz-Carlton was a

little too steep for me at $4.00 to $5.00, and I still regard the Thirty-fourth

Street Waldorf as the most glamorous and exciting hotel in my experience.<p>



<p>



The treat for a schoolboy at the Waldorf was a pot of chocolate in the Men's

Cafe; the portion consisted, simply, of a large silver pot of rich bittersweet

chocolate, a large silver pot of scalded milk, and a long silver dish piled

with heavy whipped cream--all grouped on a silver tray at a tariff of

thirty-five cents. As a generous tipper, appreciative of good service, one gave

a waiter or bellboy a quarter. There were no hotel maids; at any rate they

worked when no one was around and without demanding cash in advance for

straightening up a room.<p>



<p>



To return briefly to the nickel: it would buy, in packages of ten, Hassan or

Mecca cigarettes, with a colored photograph thrown in of a celebrated

ballplayer or prizefighter of the time; a variety of domestic cigars (when

Havana cigars were about three for a half-dollar); a ride in the subway; and

much of the contents of what was, in all truth, the five-and-ten-cent store.

The hottest competition at this price was among the saloons, most of which

boasted of putting out the biggest five-cent schooner of beer in town. <p>



<p>



The real competition by saloons lay in the nickel beer and equally in the

quality and variety of the free lunch offered with it. A certain amount of

etiquette, no doubt, governed how heartily one might feed on the basis of a

single schooner without a lift of the bartender's eyebrow, yet the free lunch

in a first-class saloon was a vast assortment of cold dishes, possibly a hot

delicacy or two like melted cheese on toast, but often flanked by a standing

roast of beef and a ham, both of towering dimensions.<p>



<p>



In a Chicago bar called Righeimer's, the free lunch was a ham or roast beef

sandwich of extraordinary quality, prepared by an elderly Negro who used a

slicing knife in each hand and turned out elegantly thin sandwiches without

handling them, offering them to the customer on the extended blade of a knife;

the style and dexterity in this operation were as attractive as the sandwich

itself.<p>



<p>



Theater tickets, for the thirty or forty attractions available of a winter

evening in New York, were somewhere around $2.00 to $2.50 for the best seats

and considerably less in the balconies. After the theater one went not to a

nightclub but to a cabaret such as Shanley's, Churchill's, or perhaps--a few

years later--the Midnight Frolic on the New Amsterdam roof. For two or three

dollars a head, one found not only first-rate entertainment in these places but

also notably good food and drink; the competition among their kitchens was just

as serious as that among the good restaurants. One other quip of that period

points up what a dollar would do: the man who was complaining to the waiter

about being charged a dollar for an order of corned beef and cabbage and who

said, "You couldn't LIFT a dollar's worth of corned beef and cabbage."

LSD and the Third Eye

<p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>

						<!--UNDERLINE-->
						
<blockquote>
<i><font size=4>After twelve years as a
stockbroker in New York, Mr. Bleibtreu's curiosity about comparative religion
and animal behavior impelled him to leave business and take up the writing of
fiction and nonfiction. He is particularly interested, as this essay shows, in
efforts to close the "two cultures gap" between science and culture. His
researches have produced a book, THE PARABLE OF THE BEAST, to be published in
England by Gollancz.</i></font><p>
	
	
	<pre>
	
	</pre>
	
	<font size=5>T</font>he current popularity of such writers as William Burroughs, Genet, and others,
who specialize in the baroque recesses of human behavior, makes it seem as if,
in this age of reason, we feel ourselves constrained within the confines of
sanity and yearn for vicarious release.<p>

<p>

The belief that in madness there may exist a core of numinous knowledge is a
commonplace in all human societies. In the Western tradition, the doctrine that
truth may be obtained through a state of mind in which reason is dislocated, a
state of ecstatic revelation, is generally supposed to have originated with the
Thracian worship of Dionysius, later becoming synthesized by Pythagorus, and to
have received its most complete elaboration in the dialogues of Plato.<p>

<p>

The class of drugs of which LSD-25 is the most potent member may prove for our
time to be a very useful tool in exploring, via the scientific method, the
roots of this age-old dilemma concerning the nature of perceived reality. That
madmen may often be capable of incredible accomplishment should be obvious to
everyone living in this century, whose history has been so monstrously deformed
by the activities of an undeniable madman, Adolf Hitler. This one terrible
example should quench all disputations concerning the correlations between
mental aberration and accomplishment. These disputations most frequently arise
in connection with accomplishment in the creative arts, where the biographies
of many greatly talented people are replete with histories of bizarre behavior
of one kind or another. It is impossible, however, to make such correlations on
any kind of statistical basis, since for every "mad artist" on the model of Van
Gogh, one can point to two equally creative, original, and productive artists
on the sane and sober models of J. S. Bach or T. S. Eliot.<p>

<p>

In addition to the artificially induced LSD state, there are other, naturally
occurring temporary states in which there is a collapse of the normal routines
by which the mind ordinarily processes the information it receives of the
outside world. Not only Hitler but before him Alexander the Great, Julius
Caesar, and Napoleon Bonaparte  all reportedly suffered from mysterious
seizures which overtook them at seemingly random times--often inconveniently.
Dostoevsky also suffered from these states, and his reports of them are
sufficiently detailed to permit a more certain medical diagnosis of his
affliction--some kind of psycho-motor epilepsy. As he describes the "aura"
which precedes his seizures, the language is remarkably similar to that used by
LSD subjects. Dostoevsky wrote: "For a few moments I experience such happiness
as is impossible under ordinary circumstances and of which other people can
have no notion. I feel complete harmony in myself and in the world and this
feeling is so strong and sweet that for several seconds of such bliss, one
would give ten years of one's life; indeed, perhaps one's whole life." Others
have reported on these aura states as well. Along with the feelings of peace
and euphoria, there is a general impression of a clear and golden shimmering
light. Quite often there is a sense of cerebral clarity as well, and solutions
of a lovely simplicity appear for the most intractably knotted problems.<p>

<p>

None of the names used to describe the class of drugs to which LSD belongs and
which produce these peculiar states of altered consciousness is completely
satisfactory. When they were first developed, they were called psychotomimetic
(imitative of psychosis), but this term rang unhappily in the ears of many who
felt that the word implied pathology and thus made a negative value judgment.
Another name for them, hallucinogenic, was unfortunate in that it rendered an
epistemological judgment--hallucinations being by definition unreal or
untrue--and if one is to maintain a proper stance of scientific objectivity,
one must suspend judgment regarding the reality of reality, for it is just
possible that in some way these drugs augment our sense receptors or in some
way so alter the mechanism of their functioning that another dimension of
reality is made manifest. This last notion is the one implied in the term
psychedelic (mind manifesting), which seems gradually to be coming into general
use to describe both the class of drugs and those states of mind with which
they are associated.<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=4><b>T</font></b>HERE is a vast literature running back for thousands of years which describes
psychedelic experiences, long before 1938, when Albert Hofmann first
synthesized d-lysergic acid dyethylamide. Some of the literature describes
attacks, sudden, spontaneous, and totally unexpected, like that attack which
overcame St. Paul on the road to Damascus. Other traditions in the literature
describe states that were induced by fasting, by the sensory deprivation
resulting from disciplined meditation (the willful exclusion of sensory input),
by hysteria through frenzied dancing or orgiastic sexuality, by hypnosis, or by
the use of various natural psychedelic intoxicants. Reports of these kinds of
exalted states have come to us not only through the literature of religious
fanaticism; such accomplished scientists as Pascal and Newton have written of
being overcome by mystic trances to which they attribute many of their creative
insights. William James well understood that the mystic was often able to
effect an almost miraculous synthesis between this world of "imagined" reality
and the world of phenomena. In recent years, psychology has tended, to its
discredit, to ignore these elements of William James's thought. One of the
happy by-products of LSD has been the revival of interest in William James on
the part of academic psychologists who had previously thought that these
concerns of his were a cranky eccentricity in the body of his worthwhile work.
Two famous reports of modern times of this kind of correlation--between the
hard factual world of science and the dreamworld of the psychedelic state--are
those of Friedrich Kekule, the German chemist who has written that he was
"presented with" the closed-chain theory of the structure of the benzene
molecule during one such dream-trance state, and Otto Loewi, who wrote that in
1921 he awakened from a dream in which was described to him the means by which
chemical transfer was accomplished between nerve and effecter cells. Loewi
rushed down to his laboratory, where he proceeded to prove the reality of the
dream--an accomplishment which led to the Nobel Prize.<p>

<p>

From the time of Dionysius to the time of Plato, the cultures of the
Mediterranean consented to this doctrine that claimed the existence of an order
of ultimate reality which lies beyond apparent reality, and that this
"paranormal" reality is accessible to the consciousness only when the "normal"
routines of mental data processing are dislocated. It was Plato's pupil
Aristotle who spoiled his master's game. Following upon Aristotle, Western
philosophy became bifurcated. The philosophical temper of our civilization,
being scientifically and technically oriented, is basically Aristotelian.<p>

<p>

No such rational figure as Aristotle arose in the Orient to a position of equal
eminence. Regardless of the reasons, Indian anatomists and zoologists, who were
no doubt just as curious as the Greeks about the origins of life, and as
skilled in dissection, did not feel compelled to set their disciplines up in
opposition to metaphysics. Metaphysical philosophy and natural philosophy
remained joined like Siamese twins. As a result, that discipline which became
medicine in the West evolved into a system known as Kundilini Yoga in the Hindu
culture. This was a system designed to produce in those who followed its
teachings a condition of controlled "creative" madness.<p>

<p>

In Western terms, Kundilini Yoga can be understood as a biological statement
couched in the language of poetic metaphor. The system made a heroic attempt to
join together the seeming disparate entities of body and mind. It is a very
complicated doctrine; in oversimplified terms, the system encourages the
practitioner to progress through the control of six stages, called chakras, of
body-mind coordination. The sixth, the highest and most exalted state, is
called the sahasrara.<p>

<p>

The physiological site of this sixth chakra, the sahasrara, is located in the
center of the forehead; it is symbolized by an eye--the so-called third eye,
the inner eye, or the eye of the mind. When this eye is opened, a new and
completely other dimension of reality is revealed to the practitioner of yoga.
Western scholars when they first came upon this literature took the third eye
to be an appropriately poetic metaphor and nothing else.<p>

<p>

But in the middle of the nineteenth century, as the subcontinent of Australia
and its surrounding territory came to be explored, a flurry of zoological
interest centered upon a lizard native to the area, the tuatara (Sphenodon
punctatum). This animal possessed, in addition to two perfectly ordinary eyes
located on either side of its head, a third eye buried in the skull which was
revealed through an aperture in the bone, covered by a transparent membrane,
and surrounded by a rosette of scales. It was unmistakably a third eye, but
upon dissection it proved to be nonfunctional. Though it still possessed the
structure of a lens and retina, these were no longer in good working order;
also lacking were appropriate neural connections to the brain. But the presence
of this eye in the tuatara still poses a puzzle to present-day evolutionists,
for almost all vertebrates possess a homologous structure in the center of
their skulls. It is present in many fish, all reptiles, birds, and mammals
(including humans). No functional role whatever could be imagined for this
structure in humans, and it remained merely an anatomical curiosity until 1898,
when Otto Heubner, a German physician, wrote a paper associating cancers of
this organ with instances of precocious puberty in children. Heubner's
observation was confirmed many times over in the intervening years and gave
rise to a number of theories concerning the role of the pineal organ as a
regulator of sexual maturity. Those who adhered to these theories considered
the pineal to be a gland, but since no secretions could be isolated or
identified as emanating from this organ, the theories remained unsubstantiated
by clinical evidence.<p>

<font size=4><b>I</font></b>N 1948 no one was paying any attention to the pineal organ. A hematologist,
Maurice Rapport, working in the Cleveland Clinic was engaged in the search for
that substance in blood serum which could be related to the tendency of blood
to clot, and which might also cause the constriction of blood vessels. He
eventually found just such a substance; it tended to make blood form clots, and
it tended to be a muscle- as well as a vaso-constrictor. Rapport named this
substance serotonin; it is manufactured quite profusely by specialized cells
lining the wall of the gut, and it is presumed to play a role of some kind in
the peristaltic movements.<p>

<p>

Directly as Rapport announced his discovery, the new chemical came under
intensive scrutiny; biochemists were eager to find means of augmenting its role
as a clotting agent and vasoconstrictor; they were also eager to find means of
blocking these functions. It was E. J. Gaddum, a professor of pharmacology at
the University of Edinburgh, who seems to have been one of the first to note a
connection between serotonin and mental states of being. In a paper published
in 1953, he pointed out the odd fact that LSD-25 was a potent antagonist to
serotonin. Two biochemists working at the Rockefeller Institute, D. W. Woolley
and E. Shaw, were similarly struck by this odd coincidence. They tested a
number of other chemicals antagonistic to serotonin and wrote in a rather
startled tone "Among each of these compounds are some that cause mental
aberrations....If this be true, then the naturally occurring mental
disorders--for example schizophrenia--which are mimicked by these drugs may be
pictured as being the result of a cortical serotonin deficiency arising from
metabolic failure rather than from drug action."<p>

<p>

This announcement produced a thrill of excited hope, which was short-lived;
there were other antagonists to serotonin just as potent as LSD which had no
effect whatever on mental states. Serotonin also refused to pass through the
so-called "blood-brain barrier." If it was injected into the bloodstream of an
animal (or a human), it did not seem to pass into the brain. But the medical
profession accommodated itself easily to this particular disappointment; for
this discovery and a series of others which occurred during the same period
gave rise to a whole new set of concepts concerning the roles of various
chemical compounds manufactured within the brain. Many of them were molecules
of a type known as amines. They were not, strictly speaking, hormones, since
they were not produced and secreted by glandular tissue, but by scattered
specialized cells, including nerve cells. They came to be called, in a quaint
reversion to eighteenth-century diction, neurohumors. According to Webster, a
humor is a fluid or juice of an animal or plant, specifically one of the four
fluids--blood, phlegm, choler, and melancholy--conceived as entering into the
constitution of the body and determining, by their relative proportions, a
person's health and temperament; hence one's disposition, or state of mind,
whether constitutional, habitual, or temporary. The discovery of the chemical
nature of these humors led to the development of chemicals antagonistic to them
and thus to entire families of humor-regulating drugs--the tranquilizers,
anti-depressants, nervous-system stimulants, and so on.<p>

<p>

But despite this new knowledge, the mystery of the LSD-serotonin antagonism
persisted. Serotonin is not an unusual chemical in nature; it is found in many
places--some of them odd, like the salivary glands of octopuses; others
ordinary: it abounds in plants; bananas, figs, plums are especially rich in it.
What was it doing in the brains of humans? What was its evolutionary history?
In 1958 a Yale Medical School professor of dermatology named Aaron B. Lerner
published a paper on the pineal gland which placed this elusive substance in
some vague kind of historical perspective and provided for it a real functional
role in the brains of mammals.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=4><b>I</font></b>T had been known since 1917 that if crushed pineal glands were introduced into
water in which tadpoles were swimming, the skin color of the tadpoles would
turn light. The chemical substance melanin is the pigment which darkens skin
color. It is located in specialized cells scattered through the topmost layer
of skin. Pineal extract caused these cells to contract in tadpole skin and in
certain other reptiles which change their skin color in response either to mood
or environmental setting. Lerner was interested in melanomas, cancers of the
pigment cells of human skin; he was curious to find out if there was any
possible connection between this skin-lightening substance found in pineals and
cancer. After an incredible four-year project, during which time he dissected
over 250,000 cattle pineal glands supplied to him by the Armour Company, he
finally isolated the substance responsible, calling it melatonin, since it
caused the contraction of melanin-producing cells.<p>

<p>

He proved that melatonin was a hormone, that it was produced specifically by
the pineal organ, and that therefore this organ was a true, functioning gland,
not merely a vestigial sight organ, a relic from our reptilian past. He
discovered, moreover, how melatonin was manufactured by the pineal--by the
action of certain enzymes on a precursor chemical which must pre-exist in the
pineal in order for it to be transformed into melatonin. This precursor
chemical turned out to be serotonin.<p>

<p>

But try as he would, Lerner could find no connection between melatonin and the
pigment cells of mammalian skin. In fact, he could find no use whatever for
melatonin in the body economy of mammals. The task of exploring the role played
by melatonin in the bodies of mammals was undertaken by a brilliant biochemist,
Julius Axelrod, working at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
Maryland, in the company of several young associates, notably Richard Wurtman
and Solomon Snyder. They discovered the basic biochemical sequences performed
by the pineal in the manufacture of melatonin; they found that it was produced
from serotonin by the action of two enzymes, an acetylating enzyme and a
methoxylating enzyme. By blocking or augmenting the action of these enzymes,
Axelrod and his assistants were able, most ingeniously, to stimulate or
suppress the organism's own manufacture of melatonin. In the course of this
work, it became apparent that Otto Heubner's old contention that the pineal
produced a substance which interfered with sexual development was very close to
the truth. Melatonin did, in fact, suppress physiological sexuality in mammals.
If test animals were stimulated to manufacture excessive amounts of melatonin,
their gonads and ovaries tended to become reduced in size, to shrink, to
atrophy. The estrous, or fertility, cycle in females could likewise be altered
experimentally by doses of melatonin.<p>

<p>

Now, two most curious functions had been attributed to the pineal gland, the
third eye, the eye of the mind. It had now been established that this organ
produced a chemical which had, indirectly at least, been associated with
psychedelic states. It also produced a chemical which suppressed functional
sexuality. The literature of religious mysticism in all ages and all societies
has viewed the mystical passion of ecstasy as being somehow analogous to, or
involved with, carnal passion. In the pineal gland, in the eye of the mind,
were discovered a hormone and a neurohumor which were functionally associated
with both kinds of passion.<p>

<p>

Axelrod and his co-workers also discovered another incredible fact. The pineal
gland produces its chemicals according to a regular oscillating beat, the basis
of this beat being the so-called circadian rhythm. This pulse remains constant
if darkness and light follow one another through the course of the day in a
regular alternation. They found that the pineal responded somehow to light
conditions, that by altering light conditions they could extend, contract, even
stabilize the chemical production rhythms of the pineal.<p>

<p>

How does the pineal perceive light, directly, by being a light sensor itself,
still performing some of the functions of an eye; or indirectly, via the
central nervous system? The evidence is still not conclusive. Light does
penetrate bone and brain to reach the pineal in significant amounts. This was
proved by a University of California zoologist, W. F. Ganong, who implanted
photocells adjacent to the site of the pineal in sheep and got altered readings
from his instruments depending on whether the animals were standing in direct
sunlight or in shade. On the other hand, if animals are blinded, or have the
nerves connecting the eye to the brain severed, some of the pineal rhythms are
dampened, just as though the animals were being maintained in continual
darkness. But there is still a sufficient number of discrepancies in the
evidence to leave the question of direct light sensing by the pineal open for
the moment. Axelrod and Wurtman believe that there are other, undiscovered
chemicals being manufactured by the pineal, for they see signs of enzyme
activity which cannot be accounted for by either serotonin or melatonin.<p>

<p>

The fact that the pineal responds to light, even if this response is indirect
via the central nervous system, has some fascinating and far-reaching
conceptual applications. There are many behavioral changes which overtake
animals as the seasons change, and which can be produced out of season in the
laboratory by simulating the appropriate span of artificial daylight. Do such
seasonal changes in mood and behavior persist in humans?<p>

<p>

The great religious holy days of all faiths tend to cluster around the times of
the solstices and equinoxes. Is it possible that the human pineal gland
responds to these alterations in the length of daylight, and by changing the
balance of neurohumors in the brain, perhaps effects a greater incidence of
psychedelic states in certain susceptible individuals just at these crucial
times? This possibility provides an entirely new potential dimension to our
secular understanding of the religious experience.<p>

<p>

Since Lerner had done his original pineal research at Yale, his colleagues
belonging to various disciplines had become fascinated with his work even
before it was published. As a result, Yale had a kind of head start in pineal
research. Among the first to pursue the trail of pineal hormones and
neurohumors was Nicholas Giarmin, a professor of pharmacology who had been a
former student of Gaddum's at Edinburgh and remembered the connection Gaddum
had made five years previous between LSD and serotonin. With him worked a
professor of psychiatry, Daniel Freedman, who had become fascinated by the
whole new field of pharmacology and states of mind. They began by measuring the
serotonin contents of the various parts of the human brain at autopsy. In order
to make these measurements, one must exploit the very limits of our
technological capacities. Neurohumors exist in the brain in infinitesimally
small amounts. They are measured by a unit known as the nanogram, which is one
billionth of a gram. Not only are assay procedures highly critical, but since
drastic chemical changes occur between that state which we call life and that
which we define as death, it is difficult to prove that the amounts of any
given entity found on autopsy are the same as those which might be found in the
same tissue in the flush of life. Giarmin and Freedman confirmed that the human
brain manufactures serotonin at various sites other than the pineal. It is
produced in scattered isolated cells, but the density of these cells varies
with their location in the brain. For example, in the thalamus, they discovered
61 nanograms of serotonin per gram of tissue; in the hippocampus, 56 ng.; in
the central gray section of the midbrain, they found 482 ng. But in the pineal,
they found 3140 ng. of serotonin per gram of tissue. The pineal was
unmistakably the richest site of serotonin in the brain!<p>

<p>

Since the pineal seems to produce serotonin in excess of its needs for
melatonin production, what happens to this excess? Does the gland provide a
kind of serotonin reservoir for the brain as a whole? Can one make a
correlation between pineal serotonin and mental disorder? As its name would
imply, the pineal looks like a miniature pine cone sitting in the middle of the
brain atop a stalklike appendage. The vascular and neural connections between
it and the rest of the body run down this 2 stalk into the spinal column and
the central nervous a system, not into the brain proper. If serotonin from the
pineal does get back into the brain proper, it a must do so through such a
circuitous route that many workers discredit this possibility.<p>

<p>

Though their work only accidentally impinged on making such correlations,
Giarmin and Freedman did find that the pineals of certain deceased mental
patients who had suffered from specified mental disorders showed a considerable
excess of serotonin in their pineals. The average amount of serotonin found in
the pineals of normal persons is about 3.52 micrograms per gland. One
schizophrenic was found to have a pineal containing 10 micrograms of serotonin,
while another patient, a sufferer from delirium tremens, had a pineal
containing 22.82 micrograms of serotonin. Owing to the difficulties of
obtaining the brains of the recently dead for autopsy, the Giarmin-Freedman
sample is pathetically small, consisting only of thirteen cases. The same
difficulties which confronted them also confront other workers who might be
tempted to confirm these findings on a larger scale.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=4><b>S</font></b>trong suspicion has fallen now on serotonin as being one of the principal
agents of the psychedelic experience, but whatever its role, it is certain that
other neurohumors are additionally involved in the chemical transactions which
produce the state. It is likely that LSD itself produces certain effects quite
on its own. Studies made with tracer elements and the electron microscope now
reveal that LSD strikes like a chemical guerrilla, entering into receptor
granules in brain cells swiftly, and then leaving swiftly after a very short
time, perhaps ten or twenty minutes (in animals). This initial period coincides
with the onset of the most violent symptoms of the LSD state as it is observed
in test animals. But when the twenty minutes are done, and the bulk of the LSD
has left the receptor granules, it is replaced by what seems to be excessive,
or supernormal, amounts of serotonin. Since the LSD state lasts for some ten
hours, and during this time serotonin can be measured (again at autopsy) in
supernormal amounts in receptor granules, it must be considered one of the
important participants of that chemical transaction which produces the state.
However, melatonin possesses the same basic indole molecular structure as the
LSD molecule. It is not at all difficult to imagine how this substance could be
metamorphosed into a psychedelic material. But so far, injections of melatonin
have produced no altered mental states in humans.<p>

<p>

The use of LSD in exploring these strange dislocated states of mind is most
convenient because the effects are invariably reliable, and within certain
limits quite predictable. All the neurohumors tend to alter, in one way or
another, the data processing programming of the brain. LSD is one of the keys
which open the compartment into which this drastic new programming can be
introduced. Fasting as a means of altering body chemistry and so producing this
kind of psychedelic state seems to be effective only among those who are
marginally nourished in the first place. Sensory deprivation IS effective, and
for those who can will themselves into a state of such intense meditation as
will exclude incoming signals from the environment, the computer model provides
a simple analogy. The brain is always working, but as these outside signals
cease coming through, the brain begins processing peripheral data, memories
from the past, sense impressions of such subtlety that they are normally
bypassed in favor of more vivid input signals which affect survival and so
on.<p>

<p>

For most of us, most of the time, our world is a Darwinian environment. We must
manipulate ourselves within it, or attempt to manipulate it in order to
survive. These survival needs tend to color our appreciation of this world, and
we are continually making judgments about it. Some, of these judgments are
based on prior personal experience, others are provided by the culture. This
"recognition system" is one of the elements disrupted by the psychedelic state.
Normally we anticipate that water will feel wet. To the madman, or the person
entranced by LSD, the wetness of water can come as an incredible surprise.<p>

<p>

The principal question concerning psychedelic estates remains: How much
disruption can the system tolerate? "Cowper came to me," writes William Blake,
"and said: 'O that I were insane always.... Can you not make me truly insane? I
will never rest till I am so. O that in the bosom of God I was hid. You retain
health and yet are as mad as any of us--over us all.'"<p>

<p>

The problem of how to maintain a certain madness while at the same time
functioning at peak efficiency has now captured the attention of many
psychiatrists. There seems to be a point at which "creative" madness becomes
degenerative, impeding function rather than stimulating it. The mental
hospitals are filled with patients who passed from transient, or occasional,
psychedelic states into perpetual psychosis. Freedman, with the help of another
Yale colleague, Malcolm Bowers, has collected a number of case histories of
persons who were admitted into mental institutions for various acute psychotic
seizures. But as they speak and write about the onset of their illness, they
describe psychedelic experiences. Why did they not "pass through" the
experience to be enriched by it, as did William Blake? Here, for example, is
the report of a twenty-one-year-old student who was removed to a mental
hospital in "a severely agitated delusional state":<p>

<p>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
"I [began to be] fascinated by the little insignificant things around me. There
was an additional awareness of the world that would do artists, architects and
painters good. I ended up by being too emotional, but I felt very much at home
with myself, very much at ease....it was not a case of seeing more broadly, but
deeper. I was losing touch with the outside world, and lost my sense of
time....I could see more deeply into the problems other people had and would go
directly into a deeper subject with a person. I had the feeling that I loved
everybody in the world. Sharing emotions was like wiping the shadow away,
wiping away a false face."<p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<p>

Bowers and Freedman do not tell us the final history of this patient. We do
know, however, that Cowper asked for insanity and got it. He died a gibbering
idiot, while Blake lived on into a ripe and irritable old age, still working,
still writing, still slipping in and out of his mysterious states which allowed
him a clear and brilliant vision of a world which, if the rest of us see at
all, we see as through a glass darkly.<p>

<p>

Man is unique by virtue of being possessed by intuitions concerning the scope
of the mysterious universe he inhabits. He has devised for himself all manner
of instruments to probe the nature of this universe. Now at last, with the
molecule of this strange acid, he has found an instrument which opens the inner
eye of the mind and which may hopefully allow him to explore the vast interior
spaces where the history of millions of years of memories lie entangled among
the roots of the primordial self. Through it we may find a means of
understanding more clearly the roots of madness and of helping the insane to
return to the world of commonplace reality.

To that end we must beprepared for heavy sacrifices in the months ahead. The demands of our militaryleaders must be met whatever the cost to the home front, for in no other waymay we hope to shorten the present agony of the world. Such being the case, itseems to some like tempting fate even to think About the state of the nationafter the war is won. O Yet the debate on the post-war world has started andthe clarification of the United Nations' war aims is an essential part of thewar effort. Certainly a public discussion of these issues must prove ofbenefit. But to my mind our post-war domestic problems should take at leastequal rank with the More colorful job of planning for the international order.For it would be my contention that the future of our foreign policy depends onthe solution of our internal problems.<p><p><p>Unlike some others, I do not fear a recurrence of old-fashioned isolationism.The contracted world of the airplane and its lethal weapons will argue moreeloquently against isolationism than a thousand orators. The facts of themilitary situation will persuade the American people that they cannot ignorethe problems of war and peace beyond the seas. Therefore, the question beforeus when the war is won will not be, Shall we play a part in the internationalscene? but, How shall we play our part? And until we settle within the UnitedStates our approach to such difficult questions as the relation of managementand labor, and the control and ownership of the tools of production; until wesquare away on a course that will make us both prosperous and free, we shall beirresolute in deciding upon our foreign policy.<p><p><p>One needs no apologies for turning his eyes on the domestic scene. If we are toconsider the post-victory era, we must give earnest thought to the organizationof the economic and social life of these United States. And one already seesthe line-up of contending forces on this front. To one observer, at least, itwould appear that the 1940's underline the truth of William Allen White'sstatement of the 1930s, that the American liberal is in the doghouse No longerare the Gilbert and Sullivan words applicable, that "every boy and every galthat's born into the world alive is either a little liberal or else a littleconservative."<p><p><p>It is not only the liberal but the conservative who seems to have disappeared.For who can locate more than a trace today of a point of view which might becorrectly designated as conservative? Who can find many men who correspond tothe famous definition of a conservative--that is, a person who feels that "whenit is not necessary to change, it is necessary not to change." In the midst ofa war economy, where military necessity determines more and more every aspectof the national pattern, who is to be found who does not believe that a changeis necessary once the war is won? A total war has automatically eliminated theconservative.<p><p><p><p><br><p><br><center><b><font size=4>2</font></b></center><p><p><p><p>We must therefore classify those who think and talk about political andeconomic matters in terms of the direction of the proposed change:reactionaries who would try to return to a condition approximating the pre-warstatus (or some earlier date), radicals who look forward to a radicallydifferent situation. I hasten to assure the reader that I have no desire toread into the words " reactionary" and "radical" any of the usual praise orcondemnation. The overtones of such words change with the generations; theradicals of the late 1860's were radical not on the economic issues which nowseem to us to be the primary concern of man, but on the issue of racialequality and the political realization of this equality.<p><p><p>Into the debate between reactionary and radical I should like to see introduceda third voice-- the voice of the American radical. I use the adjectiveadvisedly, thus distinguishing this third line of approach from that of thechief vocal groups now discussing the American future--whom I shall designate,with due apologies, " American " reactionaries and "European" radicals. Theadjectives, I submit, represent the background of the hopes and aspirations ofeach movement: For example, numerous businessmen today are saying, "If, whenthe war is over, the government will move out and leave us alone, we willrestore the American system of free enterprise and with it Americanprosperity." There can be no question of the propriety of the word "American"as applied to this side of the domestic controversy. And if some object to myuse of the word " reactionary," I would remind them that those who wish openlyfor a restoration are by definition reactionaries.<p><p><p>The use of the adjective "European" for our radical friends will probablyoffend as many as the use of the word "reactionary" for the other group. But Ithink it can be shown that those who have the most clearly defined objectivesin their social philosophy today are those who stand to the extreme left. Forthem a new world is waiting to be born. The choice before our generation, totheir mind, is clear-cut. To use the words of one spokesman for their newworld: " On the one side there its private ownership, spiritual vulgarity, andsome independence; on the other there is communal ownership, moral dignity, andpolice supervision.  The direction of evolution seems to be from the first tothe second. . . .  One may therefore hope that mankind will quickly learn theconditioned reflexes necessary to live communally, so that the "amount ofpolice supervision may not increase indefinitely, and may soon decrease." <p><p><p>This type of radical philosophy stems from them great Continental thinkers ofthe nineteenth century. The names of the predecessors of the European radicalsare to be found on the lists of the Fabian Society of England of a generationback.  The nearest approach to their ideals is to be seen in the miraculousRussian state.  Their cultural heritage has been derived from Germany, Franceand England.<p><p><p>I hardly need to make plain at this point that I am not pinning labels oneither of our two major political parties.  I am speaking rather about ageneral line of cleavage which is often spoken oft as left and right.  Thepoints of agreement and disagreement between these two groups--this roughdivision by which I have oversimplified the economic and political forces oftoday--are not to me the significant issue.  It is the lack of a third choice.For I believe that if the America of the future is to emerge from the conflictof only these two groups, the chances are not great that it will be the kind ofAmerica in which most of us would like to live. If the extremes of the twocontending forces continue to align as they do now, I fear greatly for thecause of freedom on this continent.<p><p><p>Hence, my hope that a new group of thinkers and of speakers will arise: a groupof modern radicals in the American tradition, who will make the conflicttriangular and at the same time cola tribute elements which are lacking in thepresent picture. Not that I thin]; this American radical whose importance I amurging, can alone solve the nation's problem any more than the Americanreactionary or the European radical can, but I do think he is needed in thefight.<p><p><p><p><p><br><p><br><center><b><font size=4>3</font></b></center><p><p><p><p>Now what is this American radical to be like this successor to the men whoabolished primogeniture at the founding of the Republic, who with destroyed theBank of the United States in the times of Andrew Jackson?<p><p><p>In the first place he will be obviously more indigenous than our friends theEuropean radicals or even our friends the American reactionaries. He springsfrom the American soil, firm in the belief that every man is as good as hisneighbor, if not better, and is entitled to a real chance for a decent living.Instinctively in the early days of the Republic his predecessor supported theideas of Jefferson, as against the more aristocratic and monarchicalconceptions drawn from Europe.<p><p><p>The American radical traces his lineage through the democratic revolution ofJackson when Emerson was sounding his famous call for the American Scholar.His political ideal will, of course, be Jefferson: his prophets will be Emersonand Thoreau; his poet, Whitman.  He will be respectful but not enthusiasticabout Marx, Engels, and Lenin.  We I believe he can make a good case that hiskind were the only radicals in the United States on economic matters until theclose of the nineteenth century.  What would this influential native-bornthinker of our past advocate were he confronted with our problems of today?Let me try your patience with an exercise in imagination.  Let me attempt todescribe a revised and recreated being--an American radical of the 1940s.<p><p><p><p>First of all, like all radicals and also all reactionaries, in his extrememoods he will be utterly impractical.  In general, however, being rooted in theAmerican soil he will be endowed with a considerable amount of earthy commonsense and a certain willingness to apply to the changes which he effects thetypical American question, " Does it work?" and to take up cheerfully anothertrial if the answer should be no.<p><p><p>No one needs to be told that the American radical will be a fanatic believer inequality.  Yet it will be a peculiar North American brand of doctrine. Forexample, he will be quite willing in times of peace to let net salaries andearnings sail way above the $25,000 mark. He believes in equality ofopportunity, not equality of rewards; but, on the other hand, he will be lustyin wielding the axe against the root of inherited privilege. To prevent thegrowth of a caste system, which he in abhors he will be resolute in his demandto confiscate (by constitutional methods) all property once a generation. Hewill demand really effective inheritance and gift taxes and the breaking up oftrust funds and estates. And this point cannot lightly pushed aside, for it isthe kernel of his radical philosophy.<p><p><p>He will favor public education, truly universal educational opportunity atevery level. He will be little concerned with the future of private education,except as he values independent competing groups in every phase of Americanactivity. By the same token he will be forever harping on the dangers ofFederal control of institutions concerned with youth.<p><p><p>Decentralization, local responsibility, all the old shibboleths which hisEuropean radical friends have hurled into the dustbin, he will take out, polishup, and see if by any chance they may be more applicable to the future than wesuspect. Of course, like the intelligent members of the other two groups, hewill recognize that we are going to live in the 1950's in a highly mechanized,industrialized age. He will know that the transition from a totalitarian wareconomy to the kind of utopia he envisages cannot be made with safetyovernight. For the American radical above all others is in the tradition ofhaving a job for everyone; he will rack his brains to find the equivalent ofthose magic lands of the old frontier.<p><p><p>Like Jefferson when he had to choose between his antipathy to the powers of thecentral government and the national need for the purchase of Louisiana, theAmerican radical will compromise his objections to governmental action fromtime to time. He will be ready to invoke even the Federal government in theinterests of maintaining real freedom among the great masses of the population.But, unlike the European radical, he will never cease to hope that suchremedies may be only passing sins. He will not place a higher value on propertyrights than on human rights, for his political forebears never did. He willrecall that it was " life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," not life,liberty, and property," which Jefferson wrote into the Declaration ofIndependence. And, of course, he will be very sensitive on such old-fashionedsubjects as individual rights as opposed to the police power of the state.<p><p><p>If by any chance the American radical should find his influence increasing, hemight advocate drastic revisions in the Constitution, for there are a number offundamentals in our governmental structure he might like to alter. He wouldrealize, for instance, that in a modern industrial state, government must playa much larger role than he and his friends desire. And the only hope ofpreventing his hereditary enemy, the Federal power, from increasing everydecade is to strengthen local government. Yet when he surveys the odd mixtureof areas and population which history has bequeathed to us as sovereign states,he might feel that with new areas, fewer in number and more nearly equal inpopulation and resources, local government might become another matter.<p><p><p>Of course, one brand of native American philosophy stems from the barren rocksof the chilly country of the Pilgrim fathers. It might be called individualcontrariness. And the American radical would have a fair share of this. Hewould be on many matters independent as the proverbial hog on ice. It was oneof his breed in earlier times who was stopped by a friend on his way to thetown meeting: " Don't you know, Ed," said the friend, " there ain't no use ingoing to that there meeting? Old Doc Barnes and his crowd control enough votesto carry everything they want and more too. You can't make any headway agin'em." "That's all right," Ed replied, " but I can worry 'em some."<p><p><p><p><br><p><br><center><b><font size=4>4</font></b></center><p><p><p>Nostalgia is the sleeping sickness against which the American radical wouldhave to fight. Large cities, modern transportation, big industries would be thethings difficult for his philosophy to encompass, and yet he must take theminto his pattern of thought and come out with modern answers conforming to hisbasic philosophy of life. Organized business groups and organized labor willregard the American radical with equal suspicion; and towards both he in turnwill be equally suspicious, but rarely hostile. Pressure groups are, after all,one of the recurring features in the American scene. From their conflicts hasemerged the American society of our past.<p><p><p>And the American radical, like the American reactionary, believes it on balanceto have been a good past; only he, unlike the reactionary) thinks the roadahead leads straight to a better future, a future that can come only with thechange that arises out of the smoke of constant political battle. The Americanradical believes in the ever recurring struggle to check and put back in placegroups which have attained too much power.<p><p><p>The fundamental philosophy of the American radical is a threat to much of thepresent leadership of both capital and labor. For his equalitarian doctrine, ifonly partially successful, would change the complexion of the struggle betweenmanagement and labor. And this is the crux of his contribution to the currentscene. He would use the powers of government to reorder the "haves andhave-nots" every generation to give flux to our social order. And given a highdegree of social mobility in America--a degree comparable to that in a pioneercommunity of a century ago--labor leaders would find themselves oftennegotiating with their blood relations. If at the same time ownership andmanagement of industry rarely if ever were passed on bar inheritance, nepotism,or patronage, many aspect of the current industrial picture would indeed beradically altered--altered in a characteristically American way.<p><p><p>But I must beware of pressing this utopian picture to a logical conclusion. Foreven if the American radical were to arise tomorrow, we may be certain that nomore than any other reformer would he ever succeed in bringing about themillennium.  We should judge him by the resultant of his interaction with manypressures in a social organization which faces a retailoring job if it is to beadapted to a modern industrial civilization and still preserve the elements offreedom.  We should judge him by this resultant, not by the blueprint of thefuture he holds before our eyes.<p><p><p>We may ask the American radical for at led one concrete illustration of apractical method of d increasing the social mobility on which he sets Ad muchstore. He would answer that the demobilization of our armed forces is aGod-given moment reintroducing the American concept of a fluid society.  If itis handled properly (meaning, of course, his way), we can ensure a healthy bodypolitic for at least a generation. Handle it improperly and we may well sow theseeds of a civil war within decade.<p><p><p>Here are eleven million men (or will be if did present plans are carriedthrough), a cross-section of the nation. A large proportion of them are undertwenty-five with their careers and lifework still the making.  If their futurerole in the United States is determined by their merit, their talents, theircharacter, and their grit, they and their relating will feel this is a goodland, a land of freedom come what may.  If on the other hand they feel theywere replaced in civilian life on the basis of the accidents of geography andbirth, there will be many who will become frustrated andembittered--particularly if the general level of prosperity should fall.  Herewe have a chance for a grand "Paul Jones."<p><p><p>Do we believe in equality of opportunity or not? asks the American radical.  Ifwe do, we shall set up machinery, state machinery of course (but Federallyfinanced), to see to it that the returning soldier is retrained and placed inthe kind of employment for which his talents are suited. This has been a totalwar: we must still use reluctantly a bit of totalitarian power.  To bepractical, we can't promise white-collar jobs to all the ex-soldiers.  We couldfix some quotas, perhaps, and see that they are fairly distributed. We couldeven set up agendas to lend money to groups of competent veterans who mightstart small retail or manufacturing businesses.  We could do all within ourpower to get the son of a laborer who has the capacity on the ladder ofmanagement, and with enthusiasm put a son of management who does not have thecapacity for desk work in the way of earning an honest living as a manualworker.<p><p><p>So proclaims this fanatic equalitarian.  Or else, says the American radical, wecan operate our placement services through private pressure groups and see thatsons of business executives get jobs through other business executives, andmembers of union families take up work unionized by their friends. Under suchconditions the layers of society probably would become more impervious thanever, we could depart further from our American ideal.  And a caste-riddensociety is one of potential danger--danger of eruption, danger for the libertyof all.  Not governmental employment, not pensions, but governmental guaranteeof real equality of opportunity for the veteran therefore would be the lank ofthe American radical once the war was won !<p><p><p><p><p><br><p><br><center><b><font size=4>5</font></b></center><p><p><p><p>To turn from such eminently practical matters as earning a living to theproblems of nourishing the human soul, we see also a difference here betweenthe members of my hypothetical trio.  For the American radical could notindulge his taste for "Old World culture" without a twinge of conscience.Therefore he would be impelled to sponsor a most difficult undertaking: thework of redefining culture in both democratic and American terms.  He wouldhave little patience-- too little patience--with antiquarians, scholars, andcollectors.  The idea that culture is aristocratic would find no sympathy fromhis kind.  This is one of the few points on which the American radical joinshands with his other radical friends and the Russians of the new day; hisconcept of art and culture would be terms of the present and the future, interms of every man and woman and not a special privileged few.<p><p>The American radical would be old-fashioned in his notion of the importance ofindividual integrity.  He would be harsh on cynics and easy optimists alike. Hewould be committed to a free press, to tolerance of all doctrines and themaximum of tolerance for individual action. But since he would bemoan thecynicism of our youth and the intellectual dishonesty of our age, he might wellbe fanatical in his desire for certain reforms in education. He would surely beboth unkind and unjust to this century's methods of advertising and salespromotion. For like some others he would be inclined to see in the waves ofdistorted facts and beguiling half-truths with which our eyes and ears aredaily saturated one of the most insidious maladies of the age. How he wouldcope with such a problem, I do not know. But on the subject he would be vocalif he were true to the real American radical tradition.<p><p>Such in brief is my specification for a genus Americans, whose voice I do nothear. The reader will undoubtedly derive the impression that I am sympatheticin my own personal views with the hypothetical gentleman I have just portrayed.That is true. But I should like to make it clear that I am arguing for hisintroduction into the American scene not because I believe all his aims shouldbe achieved, but because I believe his type of thinking would prove a mostbeneficial leaven. I urge the need of the American radical not because I wishto give a blanket endorsement to his views, but because I see the necessity forreinvigorating a neglected aspect of our historic pattern of development.<p><p>We must all agree that the problems we shall have to face at the close of thepresent struggle arise not alone from a global war. They arise largely from thefact that the war itself was a manifestation of a larger maladjustment. Tocorrect this maladjustment we cannot invoke the shades of the liberals of thelaissez faire Manchester school of thought. Rather in this country we mustinvoke our radical ancestors and with their spirit attack the problems of astratified society, highly mechanized and forced to continue along the road ofmass production. Without further apologies, therefore, I recommend to theattention of all who are interested in preserving freedom the need for theAmerican radical-- the missing political link between the past and future ofthis great democratic land.<p><p><p><br><p><br><p><i>JAMES BRYANT CONANT, President of Harvard university, like his famouspredecessor, Charles W. Eliot (who was also a chemist), has a way of speakingout on national issues in words that carry far beyond the confines ofCambridge, Massachusetts.

	<h4>A

DANCE TO THE MUSIC <BR>OF TIME

	

	</h4>

	<i>by Anthony Powell.</i><br><i>University of Chicago, 2,948 pages<br>in four

paperback volumes,

	<br>each $17.95 or $18.95.</i><br>

	

	<p>

	

	

	

	

	

	<font size=5>A</font>LL happy authors are alike; each unhappy author is unhappy in . . .

Well, maybe that's an oversimplification. Nonetheless, the rule occurs to me

that writers who give the impression in their work of being happy and at home

in the world do so by writing about life, real life, and trusting the reader to

recognize life. Unhappy writers may sometimes do this too, but they invariably

have their little axes to grind: they are busy trying to persuade you that

people are more sordid, or more decent, or crueler, or deeper, or stupider, or

more sex-obsessed, or more heedless, or more something, than has ever been

apparent to you, the reader, in <i>your</i> limited and shallow 

experience.<p>



This idea forcefully presented itself to me somewhere around book five or six

of Anthony Powell's great twelve-book work <i><A HREF="http://www.press.

uchicago.edu/">A Dance to the Music of Time</A></i>,

as I marveled, not for the first time, at how miraculously lifelike the series

is. Its author gives the impression of being a happy man. And Anthony Powell

(pronounced <i>Antony Po-el</i>) certainly has ample reason to be happy. He has

lead if not a charmed life at least a charming one, abloom with as many

personal and professional satisfactions as there are roses in an English

country-house garden. Now that his authorial career is for the most part behind

him (he turned ninety last month), Powell must know that in <i>Dance</i> he has

written a series that will endure. (<A HREF="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/">

The University of Chicago</A> paperback

edition, which was published last year, is the latest evidence of the series's

staying power.) For an author, that must be the greatest satisfaction of all.<p>



<i>Dance</i> deserves to endure, both because it gives a comprehensive and

subtle picture of literary and artistic life in England throughout the first

three quarters of this century and because it is a remarkable literary

achievement in its own right. The series chronicles the life -- or, really, the

milieu -- of one Nicholas Jenkins, born, as Anthony Powell was, within a few

years of the turn of the century to an army officer's family, and educated, as

Powell was, at Eton and Oxford. Jenkins, also like Powell, becomes a book

editor and litterateur, gets to know artists and models and lots of fellow

editors and writers, marries into a large family, serves in a gentlemanly sort

of capacity in the Second World War, and afterward picks up where he left off

with his literary career. Roughly speaking, the first three books (<i>A

Question of Upbringing</i>, <i>A Buyer's Market</i>, and <i>The Acceptance

World</i>), which make up the first volume of this set, cover Jenkins's school

days and the period just after; the next three (<i>At Lady Molly's</i>,

<i>Casanova's Chinese Restaurant</i>, and <i>The Kindly Ones</i>) his young

manhood; the third (<i>The Valley of Bones</i>, <i>The Soldier's Art</i>, and

<i>The Military Philosophers</i>) the war years; and the final three (<i>Books

Do Furnish a Room</i>, <i>Temporary Kings</i>, and <i>Hearing Secret

Harmonies</i>) everything after that, concluding in the 1970s--a time that

perhaps seems more contemporary today, now that tie-dye, spirituality, and home

cooking are back, than it did in the eighties.<p>



Powell has known or at least met many remarkable people over the years. The

names that leap out of his memoirs, <i>To Keep the Ball Rolling</i>, include

Graham Greene, Cyril Connolly, George Orwell (all three were his

schoolfellows), Malcolm Muggeridge, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sophie Tucker,

Kingsley Amis, Evelyn Waugh, Somerset Maugham, Cecil Beaton, Edith Sitwell, Ivy

Compton-Burnett, T. S. Eliot, Dylan Thomas, Philip Larkin, Yevgeny Yevtushenko,

Bernard Law Montgomery, Anthony Blunt <i>and</i> Guy Burgess <i>and</i> Donald

Maclean, Ian Fleming, Gore Vidal, C. P. Snow, V. S. Naipaul, Iris Murdoch,

Erich von Stroheim, Tallulah Bankhead, and King Olaf of Norway. <i>Dance</i>,

however, is not about Powell's celebrity friends but about a parallel universe,

containing all the same emotional and social characteristics, all the same

skills and talents and lucky breaks, as the universe that Powell has

inhabited--except that in the parallel universe everything is parceled out to

individuals differently. For example, a character who spectacularly ruins

himself was modeled in part on a fellow who ultimately snapped out of it and

became a successful historical novelist; in <i>Dance </i>the character goes

ahead and ruins himself, and it is someone else from his past whose name

arrives in Nick Jenkins's office mail, out of the blue, on the title page of a

thick manuscript.<p>



In his memoirs Powell details specific connections between acquaintances and

characters which demonstrate thoroughly that <i>Dance</i> is nothing so simple

as a roman &agrave; clef: that would be the wrong way to read these books.

Anyway, the people the characters resemble are not necessarily the most famous

ones. Surely Powell is speaking his own mind when he puts these words in the

mouth of a writer character (fairly prominent in later parts of the series, and

modeled on the unfamous writer Maclaren-Ross):<p>



<blockquote>



`People think because a novel's invented, it isn't true. Exactly the reverse is

the case. Because a novel's invented, it is true. Biography and memoirs can

never be wholly true, since they can't include every conceivable circumstance

of what happened. The novel can do that. The novelist himself lays it down. His

decision is binding. The biographer, even at his highest and best, can be only

tentative, empirical. The autobiographer, for his part, is imprisoned in his

own egotism. He must always be suspect. In contrast with the other two, the

novelist is a god, creating his man, making him breathe and walk. The man,

created in his own image, provides information about the god. In a sense you

know more about Balzac and Dickens from their novels, than Rousseau and

Casanova from their Confessions.'<p>



</blockquote>



But we learn about much more than Powell from <cite>Dance</cite>:

the magic of his parallel universe, after all, is how closely it tracks ours.

As Kingsley Amis reports in his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, in the course of

once interviewing Powell for a Sunday paper he asked him about the card reading

that seems to be the eternal occupation of a character named Mrs.

Erdleigh--"meaning, ahem, its artistic function," Amis explains. But that isn't

the way Powell thinks: "Ah, said Tony, a lot of people had been in fact very

keen on that sort of stuff at the time in question, so he had got it

right."<p>



<font size=5>N</font>OW, there are a few amazing aspects to <i>A Dance to the Music of Time</i>.

One is that the reader can get through twelve intricate, notably detailed

novels about Jenkins's life without ever being told what Jenkins or his wife

looks like, how many children they have, where they live, or anything of that

sort. The effect--interesting to note in contemporary, confessional America--is

to elevate the series, to give it a more high-minded tone than it would have if

the narrator told all, complaining about hair loss and bad sex and little

squabbles at the office.<p>



And yet one is deep in the mind of the narrator along with him as he reflects,

for example,<p>



<blockquote>



I knew now that this parting was one of those final things that happen,

recurrently, as time passes: until at last they may be recognised fairly easily

as the close of a period. . . . Human relationships flourish and decay, quickly

and silently, so that those concerned scarcely know how brittle, or how

inflexible, the ties that bind them have become.<p>



</blockquote>



And, from one of the war novels:<p>



<blockquote>



The longer one dealt with them, the more one developed the habit of treating

generals like members of the opposite sex; specifically, like ladies no longer

young, who therefore deserve extra courtesy and attention; indeed, whose every

whim must be given thought. This was particularly applicable if one were out in

the open with a general.<p>



`Come on, sir, <i>you</i> have the last sandwich,' one would say, or `Sit on my

mackintosh, sir, the grass is quite wet.'<p>



</blockquote>



And, toward the close of the war, when it was clear to Jenkins that Britain was

going to win, and that he stood an excellent chance of surviving:<p>



<blockquote>



Afterwards, in memory, the apple orchards were all in blossom, like isolated

plantations on which snow for some unaccountable reason had fallen, light

glinting between the tree trunks. But it was already November. There can have

been no blossom. Blossom was a mirage. Autumnal sunshine, thin, hard,

penetrating, must have created that scenic illusion, kindling white and silver

sparkles in branches and foliage. What you see conditions feeling, not what is.

For me the country was in blossom.<p>



</blockquote>



I don't mean to suggest that nothing happens and the author maunders on in

lofty abstractions. Plenty happens, including adulteries, and suicides, and

marriages, and births, and a bit of travel besides--not to mention the blitz

and the rest of the Second World War. However--and this brings us to a second

amazing aspect of the series--<i>Dance</i> doesn't exactly have a plot. Does

one's own life have a plot? Well, neither does Nick Jenkins's. Thus somehow an

entire level of the work in which fiction writers normally engage is just not

there, rather the way gingerbread trim is missing from a Frank Lloyd Wright

house--and who needs it? <i>Dance</i> is a structure pleasing for what it lacks

as well as for what it contains. Everything that happens happens at about the

same rate, and in the same undramatic manner, as it would in real life. Readers

who want to see the big picture, the grand historical trends and sweeping

changes to British life that have taken place in this century, can find them in

these books, but such readers will have to decide for themselves what the

trends and changes mean. One senses no ax-grinding, just an invitation to enter

Nick Jenkins's life and live it along with one's own.<p>



A third amazing aspect of <i>Dance</i> is the richness that it acquires through

sheer accumulation: this is why one doesn't miss a plot. In the course of the

series, after all, the reader gets to know quite a number of people. They come,

they go, they pop up again soon, or much later, or not at all. Sometimes they

meet one another and go off together, forming personal or business

relationships independent of the narrator. People one has known for hundreds of

pages, who were long strangers to each other, may have an affair or a fight, or

they may decide to start a publishing house, or nothing may come of their

meeting--just as in real life. This is, of course, interesting only because the

characters are distinct and interesting. They certainly are. And what could

forgivably have been mundane descriptions serving no higher purpose than to

move events along become fascinating little baubles in themselves. This is an

opera with no recitative, only arias. Somehow there always seems to be a point

to whatever it is Powell is talking about. Even the details--and, again, there

are many of them--are meaningful, because it matters to him to have "got it

right." Here, for example, is a throwaway description of an eminence who has

been invited to lunch and who is arriving a bit late.<p>



<blockquote>



He came hurriedly into the room, a hand held out in front of him as if to grasp

the handle of a railway carriage door before the already moving train gathered

speed and left the platform. <br>. . .<p>



He gave a rapid glance round the room to discover whom he had been asked to

meet, at the same time diffusing about him a considerable air of social

discomfort. Lady Warminster accepted St John Clarke's hand carefully, almost

with surprise, immediately relinquishing it, as if the texture or temperature

of the flesh dissatisfied her.<p>



`I hope you were not expecting a grand luncheon party, Mr Clarke,' she said.

`There are only a few of the family here, I am afraid.'<p>



Plainly, that was only too true.<p>



</blockquote>



<i>Dance </i>can be tremendously funny, though as I've learned from setting

pages that made me laugh out loud in front of others not immersed in Powell,

the humor, too, depends on the steady accumulation of detail. Only with enough

background can one experience one's full measure of glee in watching

antithetical characters meet, or eccentrics carry on, or, simply, Nick Jenkins

enter a room and observe what's going on around him.<p>



<font size=5>H</font>OW on earth did Powell do it? How did he even keep all his many dozens of

characters straight--never mind keeping up the tone for 2,948 pages, written

over two and a half decades? He asserts in the memoirs that he made less than a

hundred pages of notes altogether. And yet he always knows just where he's

going, and where he's been. In the war volume this description of

"Hogbourne-Johnson, a full colonel with red tabs," appears:<p>



<blockquote>



A Regular, decorated with an MC from the previous war, he was tall,

getting decidedly fat, with a small beaky nose set above a pouting mouth

turning down at the corners. He somewhat resembled an owl, an angry, ageing

bird, recently baulked of a field-mouse and looking about for another small

animal to devour.<p>



</blockquote>



There the metaphor is dropped. Seventy-two pages later one wonders whether one

has finally caught Powell in a lapse of attention, for the reader is told that

another officer, Major Finn, "looked like an enormous bird." Did Powell forget

that he had already described one military man in bird terms? Of course not. He

continues by saying that Finn was "an ornithological specimen very different

from Colonel Hogbourne-Johnson, kindly but at the same time immensely more

powerful."<p>



Ultimately, what keeps one reading is that virtually every page offers

charming, or profound, or at least intriguing insights.<p>



<blockquote>



It is not easy--perhaps not even desirable--to judge other people by a

consistent standard. Conduct obnoxious, even unbearable, in one person may be

readily tolerated in another; apparently indispensable principles of behaviour

are in practice relaxed--not always with impunity--in the interests of those

whose nature seems to demand an exceptional measure.<p>



There is, after all, no pleasure like that given by a woman who really wants to

see you.<p>



One passes through the world knowing few, if any, of the important things about

even the people with whom one has been from time to time in the closest

intimacy.<p>



Now the war was over one constantly found oneself congratulating people. In a

mysterious manner almost everyone who had survived seemed also to have had a

leg up.<p>



Thinking--as General Conyers used to insist--damages feeling. No doubt he had

got the idea from a book. That did not make it less valid.<p>



</blockquote>



One becomes more and more bound up in Powell's parallel universe, until the

novels begin to seem like a long, long, long letter by a witty and kindly old

friend, filling one in on what has become of other old friends. I have a number

of friends in the real universe who I felt would be susceptible to

<i>Dance</i>'s charms, and having encouraged them to read it, I find that we

can talk about the characters almost as if we were discussing people in our own

circles.<p>



In fact, curiously, no books have ever made me feel more as if I were living

someone else's life along with him. As one reads <i>A Dance to the Music of

Time</i>, one looks forward to meeting certain characters again as much as one

does to seeing favorite people in life; one looks forward to parties in the

books as much as to real parties. Anyone who has hated to finish a book because

then there will be no more of it to read will easily see the advantage in the

extravagant length of the series. Throughout the novels the reader is compelled

onward, onward, without ever being eager for that long life, this <i>Dance</i>,

to end.

<font size=5>I</font> HAVE the rare good fortune to live within walking 

distance of a bona fide national monument.  <A 

HREF="http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~scaturro/">Grant's Tomb</A> is just a mile 

and a half from my apartment, and I visit it whenever I have the 

time--which, since I am a writer, is too often.  I tell myself that making 

the trek is good for my body, hiking uphill on Riverside Drive, taking in 

the relatively clean air along with some of the most beautiful vistas in 

Manhattan.  But in truth I do it for less corporeal reasons.  I find it 

comforting, even uplifting, to hang around a place so greatly revered that 

the federal government pays its bills and even posts rangers to take care 

of it.  And it's gratifying to know that I live so close to something that 

draws tourists from around the world.  Sure, I suppose I could say the same 

thing if I lived a few blocks from the <A 

HREF="http://theinsider.com/TIPS/2EMPIRE.htm">Empire State Building</A> or 

<A HREF="http://www.onworld.com/CAM/html/cities/ny2B.html">Rockefeller 

Center.</A> But Grant's Tomb is far from the glitz of midtown, and besides, 

it has something those places don't.  Something that's new and different 

every time I see it.  Something I didn't even notice until recently, 

although it's been there for a long time--so long, in fact, that none of 

the rangers can remember when it wasn't.<p>



Of course, it's not the kind of thing you tend to notice immediately in a 

classical mausoleum with two eight-and-a-half-ton sarcophagi of Wisconsin 

red granite, five scowling bronze busts, and a pair of seventeen-foot-high 

wood-and-bronze doors.  And there are so many other things to capture your 

attention: The great mural on the rotunda of Lee surrendering to Grant at 

Appomattox.  The displays about <A 

HREF="http://www.lib.siu.edu/projects/usgrant/">Grant's life,</A> about the 

building of the monument, and about the local African-American 

community.</A> The tiny gift shop, with its <A 

HREF="http://funnelweb.utcc.utk.edu/~hoemann/cwarhp.html">Civil 

War</A>-related biographies and coloring books and replica Confederate 

currency.  The desk, where the rangers give out brochures and bus schedules 

and subway maps.  The huge electric fan that pushes the marble-cooled air 

around rather nicely in the summertime.  I even spotted the brown blotches 

on the ceiling, remnants of water damage from the winter of 1993-1994, when 

a new snowstorm seemed to hit the city every Wednesday.  But somehow I had 

long managed to overlook what has become my favorite Grant's Tomb exhibit, 

sitting alone atop a low brass bookstand near the door.<p>



It's a big, old-fashioned guest register--the kind you might see at a country

inn or a wedding--with columns for name, date, place of origin, and comments.

The accompanying pen isn't chained to anything, so it disappears from time to

time, but the rangers keep replacing it.<p>



That's a good thing, too.  I'd hate to think what would happen if the Parks 

Department ever gave up on the guest register.  At the very least, some 

local denizens would lose a place to record thoughts, ideas, or merely the 

fact that they are still alive.  My favorite is Bill, a semi-retired 

security guard who uses the register to keep track of his progress as a 

runner.  Every day Bill, who has survived both a Bronx orphanage and the Korean War,</A> jogs the 

two and a half miles up from Seventy-second Street.  On his way he'll often 

pass me, less than half his age, and offer encouragement.  "Look at me," 

he'll say, puffing and trotting backward to face me.  "Sixty-five years 

old!  I've lost thirty pounds!  Someday we'll run together!" The "someday," 

of course, is when <i>I </i>get into shape.  Anyway, whenever Bill makes 

particularly good time, or just when he feels like it, he takes government 

pen in hand and records his feat for the ages.  U. S. Grant's guest book is 

his <A 

HREF="http://sunsite.sut.ac.jp/louvre/paris/hist/triomphale.html">Luxor 

Obelisk.</A> "Bill T." he'll inscribe, with proud flourishes.  "New York, 

NY. 24:40:89.  4th best time.  65 years old." Had Bill been sixty-five in 

1862, I am certain he would have stormed Fort Donelson with "Unconditional 

Surrender" Grant.  Maybe even ahead of him.



<p>





<CENTER>

<font size=5><B>.  .  .</B></font>

</CENTER>



<p>

Unlike Bill, most people who visit Grant's Tomb do so only once, and most of

them confine their comments to two not terribly creative words. "Very nice" is

a frequent entry. So are "Good tour," "Enjoyed it," and "Love U.S." (I'm never

sure whether that last one refers to the general or his country.) In summertime

"Get A.C." and its more polite cousin, "A.C., please!" show up several times a

page. "Get bathrooms!" is a year-round favorite. "We see that a lot," a ranger

told me recently. "People are always horrified when they find out there aren't

any public bathrooms in here. But think about it: This is a cemetery. Do you

have bathrooms in a cemetery?"<p>



Occasionally people wax a little more contemplative. Once in a while, for

example, someone will offer an interpretation of "Let Us Have Peace," a famous

postwar motto of Grant's, which is inscribed over the tomb's entrance. "No more

wars!" "Peace to all," "Someday, let us all know peace," and "Peace, please!"

all pay homage to the general's pacifistic inclinations. I'm not so sure about

"Let there be peace and balance the budget" and "No Jesus, no peace--Know

Jesus, know peace," but at least they were trying.<p>



So, I suppose, was the guy who scribbled "Free beer! The general would agree!"

I imagine he's someone whose presence at a party inspires everyone else to

wonder who invited him and why; still, he <i>did </i>evidence some knowledge of

history. I try to find something redeeming in everyone, but occasionally

there's just no way. One guy from Greenwich, Connecticut, used his

"suggestions" space to demand, "Abolish funding for public TV." A woman from

Wermelskirchen, Germany, wrote, "Is it so important still to honor this person?

Let's look to the future!" Thank goodness for the fellow from Knokke, Belgium,

who wrote on the very next line, "It might scare you! Let us look to the past

and <i>learn </i>for the future"--displaying, I believe, remarkable

restraint.<p>



"What are the international implications?" a local man wrote one day. As if to

answer him, a tourist from Taipei wrote, "The floor is not shining!" (thus

demonstrating what is meant by the expression "Taipei personality"). "Diversity

is liberty and tolerance," wrote someone from Barcelona; I don't know exactly

what that means, but I'm sure it's a noble sentiment, one that undoubtedly

became popular in Spain sometime after the Inquisition. Its author certainly

showed more thought than did the family from Windsor, Connecticut, who wrote,

"Open the coffins!" three times. "We get that one a lot too," a ranger told me

with a sigh. "There are some sick people out there."<p>



The ranger wasn't laughing. Gradually I stopped laughing too. The whole thing

was starting to irritate me. "I love Robbie W.!" "It's my birthday!" "My

boyfriend did the snow angel out front." "Hey ho let's go." "Let's go

Rangers!!" "Oh Baby, Oh Baby, Oh Baby!" One day a woman who identified herself

as a native of Havana wrote, "Very nice for a dead guy."<p>





<CENTER>

<font size=5><B>.    .    .</B></font>

</CENTER>



<p>



Ultimately I was saved from terminal curmudgeonliness by one of the tallest,

darkest people I have ever seen. It was a muggy August day; I was sprawled on

the tomb's front steps when I saw him walk inside. Later, when I got up and

went in myself, to cool off, I spotted him at the book, bent over the podium

and tapping the pen against his wrist, deep in thought. Then he wrote

something, replaced the pen gingerly, and walked out. I stared at the register

for a few seconds, uncertain whether I wanted to know or not. Finally I walked

over and looked at the bottom line. The man was from Lagos, Nigeria. He had

written, "I join the U.S. people in saluting this great hero."<p>



That was it. Nothing witty or clever or self-serving or self-referential. Just

ten words indicating that he appreciated Ulysses S. Grant and his monument,

that "the international implications" were plain and obvious, that the money

the government shells out to keep the place open and running is money well

spent.<p>



Fortunately, he's not alone. A guy from Champaign, Illinois, wrote, "Best

things my taxes ever paid for, these parks." A woman from Berlin wrote, "A

great tomb after a great life." A man from Nice wrote, "A most impressive

display of national memory." A couple from Manhattan wrote, "Simple, yet

beautiful and elegant. They don't build monuments like this anymore. Too bad."

A woman from Buenos Aires wrote, "It's nice to see you give such an importance

to your traditions and the people who built your nation." Some visitors from

Manchester, England, wrote, "Impressive and a credit to the American people to

show their gratitude in such a way." A man from Beijing wrote, "Freedom is

great."<p>

<blockquote>
	
	<font size=5>T</font>here is an anecdote about a young collector who visited Mark Rothko
	 in his studio in the early 1950s, a time when easel-scale painting dominated the art market.
	  Rothko's canvases, as yet modestly priced but seven to eight or more feet tall, appeared 
	  forbiddingly large for any then-conceivable domestic setting. "Where are people going to hang 
	  your paintings?" the collector asked, and the artist replied, "People just haven't built the 
	  houses yet for my paintings." Rothko of course proved to be right. Art-lovers' houses were
	   adapted to accommodate the large-scale paintings of the Abstract Expressionists and
	    subsequent schools. So, too, the development of very large new sculpture has led to the
	     creation of sculpture parks all over the United States, Europe, and Japan. <P>
The grandest and most important American sculpture park to date is the Storm King Art Center, in
 Mountainville, New York, approximately an hour and a half north of New York City. On more than 
 400 acres of open, rolling meadows some 120 sculptures are installed. These works, by noted
  sculptors including Alexander Calder, Mark di Suvero, Alexander Liberman, Richard Serra, and 
  Kenneth Snelson, range in scale from that of the human figure to towering works three or four 
  stories high. <P>
The pride of the collection is a glorious group of thirteen works by David Smith, who is widely
 considered the most important American sculptor of the twentieth century. Storm King's Smith
  sculptures--some in rusted steel and others in stainless, many incorporating found objects such
   as everyday tools and utensils, others composed of hard-edged slabs of burnished metal--evoke 
   human proportions on a heroic scale. The largest group of Smith's work anywhere outdoors, 
   they make Storm King an obligatory stop for anyone seriously interested in the sculpture of 
   our time. <P>
Photographs of sculpture in magazines and museum publications, it seems, are invariably shot on
 cloudless summer days when all of nature smiles. Many years of working with sculpture in
  outdoor settings have led me to the realization that it is in the winter, and especially on
   overcast days, that sculpture makes its greatest contribution, when nature sleeps and trees 
   stand bare and only sculpture blooms. It is also only in the out-of-doors that sculpture can
    be seen in the full range of changing light: with the sun shining from the east in the
     morning and from the west in the afternoon, high in the summer and slanting low in the
      winter. On sunny days there are sharp shadows, which become soft contours and shading
       when clouds gather. Sculpture indoors, however well-lit, is necessarily static. Only 
       under an open sky can sculpture come to life in all its richly varied aspects. <P>
       
      <font size=5>T</font>he taste for sculpture out of doors goes far back in history. One of the 
      earliest recorded sculpture parks is the elaborate garden that the Roman Emperor Tiberius 
      created on the island of Capri, in the Bay of Naples. When Tiberius retired there, in A.D. 27,
       he built a large palace on the highest promontory, decorating the surrounding garden with 
       marble and bronze statuary. Looking at the ruins that remain, one can only imagine what 
       this idyllic place must have looked like, carefully planted and tended and filled with art.
        As was usual at the time, the figures surely represented personages from classical mythology.
<P>The classical taste for garden statuary was revived, along with much else of the Roman and Greek
 past, during the Renaissance. Beginning in Italy in the fifteenth century, the fashion for formal 
 gardens punctuated with statuary of mythological figures spread across Europe. It reached a climax
  in the French royal gardens of Versailles, which in turn were imitated in the eighteenth century 
  by many smaller royal residences all over Europe. With the growth of cities and the rise of the
   middle classes in the nineteenth century, similar statuary began to invade the new urban public
    parks, of which Central Park, in New York, is an outstanding example. Central Park is of course
     not primarily a sculpture park but rather a place that uses art to enhance its many functions.<P>
Only in our own century has the idea developed of a park or garden whose primary focus is the 
display of contemporary sculpture. At the same time, certain changes in the nature of sculpture have
 come about, in two stages. The first began when Picasso and Julio Gonzalez in the early decades of
  the century adopted materials previously not considered admissible for the making of art--scraps 
  and found objects--which in their hands were transformed. The second change took place after the
   Second World War: the metamorphosis of sculpture as statuary into sculpture as pure form, often 
   leaving behind not only human and animal figuration but also the correspondingly modest scale
    that had prevailed until then. Pioneers in developing new formal vocabularies for sculpture 
    included Calder, Smith, Isamu Noguchi, Di Suvero, Serra, Beverly Pepper, Liberman, and George
     Rickey in the United States, Henry Moore and Anthony Caro in England, and Bernar Venet in 
     France. Materials previously neglected, in particular structural and industrial steel,
      attracted their attention and made possible the creation of very large sculpture for the
       outdoors. Eventually the simple fact of their existence led people who were passionate about
        art to want to place these powerful new works in appropriate settings, and stimulated a
         happy profusion of parks dedicated to the display of sculpture.<P>
         
        <font size=5>L</font>ike every sculpture park I know of, Storm King (open daily April 1 to
         November 15; call 914-534-3115 for more information) is the product of a highly personal,
          individual vision. Ralph Ogden, who died in 1974, was a local industrialist who bought 
          the property in order to found a museum; the house there has become the central museum 
          structure. Together with his son-in-law H. Peter Stern, who now heads Storm King,
           Ogden endowed the estate with a collection that became important with the acquisition 
           of the thirteen David Smith sculptures. In addition to its very impressive permanent 
           collection, Storm King has to date featured annual exhibitions that occupy the galleries
            in the house along with a sizable part of the carefully groomed grounds. In its 
            scale
             and ambition, in the quality and quantity of works shown, in the wide and imaginative
              reach of its exhibitions, Storm King remains unique in the world. <P>
Its nearest competitor is Laumeier Sculpture Park, in St. Louis, Missouri (open daily year-round; 
call 314-821-1209 for more information). Whereas the almost 100 acres of its grounds are carefully
 maintained by the county parks department, the sixty-five or so sculptures on view are in the
  charge of a sometimes financially hard-pressed foundation, with the result that not all of them 
  are cared for as well as they should be. Nonetheless, monumental sculptures by leading artists
   of the postSecond World War period make a visit to Laumeier an exciting experience. <P>
The park contains both site-specific sculptures and works brought from elsewhereworks made, as it
 were, on spec. This allows a visitor to compare these two ways of making sculpture, a topic much
  discussed in the world of art. Among my favorite works here are a refreshing George Rickey that 
  moves like a whirligig in the lightest breeze, Beverly Pepper's first site-specific 
  amphitheatrical earthwork sculpture, and major pieces by Di Suvero and Liberman. <P>
Back on the East Coast a particularly challenging outdoor environment is Socrates Sculpture Park,
 on an abandoned industrial site of four and a half acres bordering the East River in Long Island 
 City, New York (open daily year-round; call 718-956-1819 for more information). The rough, 
 casually landscaped grounds of Socrates Park contrast dramatically with the glamorous skyline of
  Manhattan's Upper East Side, across the water. Founded by Mark di Suvero, who remains the guiding
   spirit of the place, the park shows work by rising younger sculptors and better-established ones. 
   Every six months a new installation takes place, consisting of ten to twenty recent works by a 
   variety of artists, many of whom complete their pieces on site. For a Manhattan museum or 
   gallery visitor Socrates is only a short taxi ride across the Queensboro Bridge. <P>
Nearby is the <A HREF="http://www.inch.com/~snippy/noguchi/entrance.html">Noguchi Garden Museum
</A> (open Wednesday through Sunday from April through October; call 
718-204-7088 for more information), dedicated exclusively to the work of the late Isamu Noguchi.
 Born of an American mother and a Japanese father, Noguchi in his life and his art blended the two 
 cultures. His partly roughhewn, partly highly polished stone sculpture is clearly influenced by 
 Japanese traditions, as are the now almost ubiquitous Akari lamps that he designed. At the same 
 time, his vision has a decidedly American scale. The Noguchi Garden Museum is an ideal
  environment in which to see the artist's work in all its phases, spanning a career of some 
  sixty years. The name Garden Museum is apt, in that an indoor museum, a warehouse for his 
  sculpture which Noguchi bought, across the street from his studio and workshop, is combined with 
  a walled garden designed by Noguchi himself for the display of his outdoor work. <P>
There are two spaces besides Socrates Park that show constantly changing displays of newly made
 sculpture. The better-known one is Grounds For Sculpture, in Hamilton, New Jersey, not far from 
 Princeton (open Friday through Sunday, and by appointment Tuesday through Thursday, year-round;
  call 609-586-0616 for more information). Its twenty-two acres have been carefully landscaped to
  provide a setting for rotating exhibitions of new work, primarily by emerging artists. Near Santa
   Fe, New Mexico, is the Shidoni Gallery and Sculpture Park (open daily year-round;
    call 505-988-8001 for more information). Only eight acres in size, it presents 
    sculpture made 
    at the Shidoni foundry work that ranges from good to merely ambitious to outright kitsch.
     However, a visit can include a tour of the foundry itself and the always exciting spectacle 
     of seeing sculpture in progress. <P>
For all the corporate art sponsorship and collecting that was so widely discussed in the 1980s, 
not many companies involved themselves with sculpture in a major way. One that did was the company 
that makes Pepsi-Cola. Its PepsiCo sculpture gardens are located in suburban Purchase, New York, 
on 168 well-tended wooded acres (open daily year-round; call 914-253-2000 for more information). 
This is the site of the company's headquarters as well as of some forty sculptures by Calder, 
Jean Dubuffet, Henri Laurens, Arnaldo Pomodoro, and David Smith, among other artists who were 
fashionable at the time the sculptures were being acquired. (Little has been added in recent 
years, which have seen increasingly sharp questioning by Wall Street of this type of corporate
 expenditure.) One of my favorites here is a George Segal in which three apparently plaster-cast
  people are portrayed sitting on an ordinary garden bench. Their ambiguous, almost eerie
   presence adds a wonderful sense of mystery to the entire setting. PepsiCo also boasts a 
   particularly handsome Henry Moore, Double Oval. Another fine work is a Surrealist family group
    by Max Ernst, which radiates magic in its wooded setting. <P>
Again, a sculpture park tends to be the result of the vision of one man or woman--even when a 
spouses name has been added to the name of the institution for reasons of sentiment or courtesy. 
This individual quality is particularly evident at Kykuit Gardens, near Tarrytown, New York (open 
daily except Tuesday from April through October; call 914-631-9491 for more information). Formerly
 the country home of Nelson Rockefeller, the spectacularly sited house and gardens--the
  estate's old Dutch name means "Lookout"--are now open as a museum. A visit to the house, which 
  is barely changed since Rockefeller's day, can make one feel almost as if one had met the
   collector in person. The same feeling arises from a tour of the seventy-odd sculptures,
    which are sensitively placed in the formal plantings surrounding the residence. 
    The collection exemplifies the modern sculpture that fired the enthusiasm of Rockefeller's
     generation: works by Aristide Maillol, Jean Arp, Giacometti, Picasso, and Moore, 
     among others--artists who began by building on Rodin's heritage and went on to absorb 
     and reflect the discoveries of Cubism and the impact of the Surrealist vision. At the time
      Rockefeller acquired the works, his choices were seen as highly adventurous, if not radical,
       by the staid world in which he lived. Now these sculptures are recognized as undisputed
        classics. <P>
I must mention three other worthwhile places to see sculpture. First, in Allentown, Pennsylvania,
 Philip Berman continues to collect on a very grand scale. The town's Lehigh Valley Hospital boasts
  the Philip and Muriel Berman Sculpture Park (open daily year-round; call 610-402-2273 for 
  more information). Allentown's extensive park system is peppered with contemporary sculpture 
  courtesy of the Bermans, and so is the campus of Muhlenberg College. All the works were acquired
   when the sculptors were still young, emerging artists, although by now many, including Mark di 
   Suvero, Jon Isherwood, and Peter Hide, have achieved international reputations. <P>
The Bradley Sculpture Garden, in Milwaukee (open daily year-round by appointment; call 414-276-68
40 for more information), is the creation of the late Margaret Bradley. She was an avid and early 
collector of modern art, gifted with a remarkable eye. Her world-class painting collection is today
 the core and the pride of the Milwaukee Art Museum. Bradley adapted as her home an old farmhouse 
 on the northern outskirts of the citya place of wide-open fields in a plain that glaciers
  flattened during the last Ice Age. She added ponds and hill-like rises, and brought works by the
   progressive sculptors of her time, including Archipenko, Max Bill, Sorel Etrog, Barbara Hepworth,
    Isamu Noguchi, and George Sugarman, to make a sculpture park of singular charm
     and highly personal appeal. <P>
Finally, opening to the public later this month is Pyramid Hill Sculpture Park and Museum, 
in southern Ohio, near the small city of Hamilton, in the environs of Cincinnati (the park will 
be open daily except Monday year-round; call 513-868-8336 for more information). In this case the 
imaginative, committed enthusiast is Harry Wilks. The 250 acres here, in the midst of rolling 
hills, are surely the most beautiful natural setting of any art park in the country. Pyramid 
Hill is worth watching for.<p>
(Basic information about these and many other sculpture parks and gardens can be found in 
a directory published by Sculpture magazine. Copies are available for $10.00; to order one call 
202-785-1144.) <P>

<FONT SIZE=5>T</FONT>o get the most out of a visit to a sculpture park, it is particularly 
helpful to bring along a camera, even if the camera contains no film. For most of us, the eye is a 
very lazy organ, and we need to give it a push to make it really see. The best way to do this is to 
look with a single, Cyclops' camera eye and pretend to photograph--or actually photograph. With a
 camera we are driven to find the one view of a given sculpture that summarizes the entire work--the 
 one out of the 360 degrees of views encircling the sculpture, not to mention the innumerable views 
 that raising or lowering the camera can add. A little bit to the left, a bit more profile, just a
  little higher--and suddenly the studious eye, forced to make judgments, begins to discover
   complexities and aspects of a sculpture that the casually glancing, untrained eye will never see.<P>
Another useful bit of advice is always to make a point of looking at the back of figurative 
sculpture, especially the backs of human figures and torsos. Remarkably often the backs are
 sculpturally more satisfying and more beautiful than the fronts. Our entire culture is frontally 
 oriented--in architecture, in automobiles, in clothing, and, indeed, in our bodies. Backs are thus 
 all too often overlooked in art. Over the years I have installed a good many Greek and Roman
  marble torsos. When they were installed front forward, very few visitors ever bothered to look at
  the usually more beautiful backs. When the torsos were turned so that their backs faced out, 
  visitor after visitor would admire them as they were presented and then, inevitably, walk around 
  to satisfy curiosity by peeking at the front!

		 </font>ne of the most stuck-up guys I ever met is the 
piano virtuoso Franz Liszt. When I mention this, people always say, "But 
he's dead!" Try telling <I>him </I> that. I just finished a nine-week, 
twenty-nine-city book tour with the guy, and yes, he is old--he may 
even be "dead" (whatever that means)--but he is definitely one big 
pain. And when I say I was on a book tour, I flatter myself. It was 
supposed to be a tour to promote my most recent work of fiction, 
<I>Buh </I>. Well, instead it became one of these new "piggyback" tours 
that publishers are so crazy about these days, where they send an author 
along with an established performing artist, a surefire crowd-getter like 
the popular Herr Liszt. Don't look at me--I just do what they tell me: 
sit at a table in the concert-hall lobby, sign books, read a short 
selection during intermission (<I>What </I> intermission? The guy never 
comes up for air!), introduce myself to the culture-page editors waiting 
to interview him, get myself known. The Liszt crowd is a reading crowd, I 
was told.<P>
I first met him in the sitting room of his suite in the Brown Palace 
Hotel, in Denver. Technically, of course, it was <I>our </I>suite, since 
my (smaller) bedroom and bath were part of it; but any space I shared with 
him immediately became his, and I see no reason to pretend otherwise now. 
He was smoking a complicatedly carved briar pipe and reading a copy of 
<I>What's Doing in Downtown Denver </I> supplied 
by the hotel. He hopped up on his long, wavery legs, introduced himself, 
and warmly took my hand. His fingers, which play tenths as easily as most 
concert pianists play octaves, twined around my wrist. I'd read in the 
publicity how "his sea-green eyes shone with rapid flashes like waves in 
flames," but that effect got by me somehow. Mainly what I was wondering 
was how he achieved that Gyro Gearloose flyaway look with his side hair. I 
went to my room to unpack, and when I returned, ten minutes later, the 
place was mobbed. Liszt fans were perched on the telephone table, the 
cabinet with the complimentary snack bar, and the window sills as he 
launched into a story about the time Edvard Grieg killed a spider with a 
piano stool--a recitation I was, unfortunately, to learn by heart. 
Bare-shouldered ladies sitting at his feet vied to rest their heads on his knees.<P>


<img src="Liszt.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

Talk about <I>party </I>! When does he ever sleep? I stood around on the 
fringes and tried to make conversation, but I was pretty beat from my 
flight. As I headed off to bed, he was ordering up baskets of champagne. I pulled 
a pair of those foam-rubbery hotel pillows around my ears to drown out the 
noise, and eventually I drifted off. The next I knew, I was wide awake to 
the sound of his uproarious laughter. I hunted for the digital clock by the bed--they never put those things where you can see them 
lying down--and discovered it was four-fifteen. Now he was humming 
loudly and contrapuntally, if that's possible, to merry applause from the 
entourage. Somehow I got back to sleep. At five of six I heard a knock on 
my door. There he stood, fully dressed in old-time formal clothes and a 
velvet cape. He wanted me to check the little button doohickeys behind the 
knee on his knickers or knee breeches or whatever they were, to see if 
he'd got them buttoned right. I mean, <I>enough </I> already!<P>
I'm not even going to discuss our first "event," it was such a nightmare. 
I held the fort at my table in the lobby and sold exactly two books, both 
of them to other writers who asked if they could send me manuscripts, as his SRO horde 
of screaming admirers strewed rose petals everywhere (the pink ones stain, 
by the way). I kept promising myself a big drink for later, and by the end 
of the evening it had grown to the size of a drink on a Hollywood 
billboard. I escaped at the first opportunity; after that the picture 
mercifully blurs.<P>
<P>
<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/L-small.gif" align=left height=44 
	alt="L">
     </font>iszt hadn't played in public since 1886, so naturally a lot of anticipation had built up. We sat together on the flight to Salt Lake City; when we got off
the plane, there were about 200 panting Liszt-omanes waiting for him, and 
Art Knapp, from the Bookworm's mall store, waiting for me. If Art hadn't been holding up a copy of my book, I'd never 
have spotted him in the melee. (I can pick out that 
awful cover--why my agent didn't get us cover 
approval I'll never know--at 500 yards.) I hadn't checked any bags, so 
I just left Liszt to his fate and let Art lead me to his car. He asked how 
my tour was going so far, and I lied and said great. Then he asked who was 
that old fellow everyone was clamoring for. I wanted to grab him right 
there on the moving walkway and give him a kiss. Turned out he had never 
heard of him! Thank God there's still some sanity left in the land. But I 
hid my feelings and explained politely about the world-renowned 
nineteenth-century pianist and blah blah blah, as if I were an expert on 
the subject myself.<P>
Later it got back to me that Liszt was really upset that I had run out on 
him at the airport. What was I supposed to do, trail along and hand out 
the smelling salts?<P>
I couldn't help it. He just rubbed me wrong, constantly. Little things he did got on my nerves--the way he always said 
"<I>bitte </I>" after every question, for example. "Would you hold my 
garment case for a moment, <I>bitte </I>?" "I cannot fit this under my 
seat, so may I place it under yours, <I>bitte </I>?" I had to <I>bitte </I> 
my tongue not to tell him what he could do with his <I>bitte </I>. And 
those damn cookbooks he carried everyplace he went. He used to read 
recipes out loud to me and then ask, "Ahhh--doesn't that sound good?" 
And he ate Pez candies, the kind in the little dispenser. He was always 
popping one into his mouth. He has an amazing sweet tooth. What makes it 
worse is that he never puts on any weight! Any sweets I eat always go 
straight to my hips. But old Liszt is one of those skinny, hyper musician 
types we'd all secretly love to be. And I don't have to tell you how those 
guys do with women. Fantastic is how they do. <P>
I mention this partly because of the chocolatier. In some airport or other 
Liszt met an attractive young chocolatier named Felice. We had stopped in 
a candy shop on the concourse to buy him his customary in-flight snack of 
two pounds of chocolate truffles. Felice, who waited on us, fell 
instantly, madly in love with him, closed up shop, bought a ticket, hopped 
on our flight, and was with us from then on. It happened that fast. Liszt 
was mad for her, too. And of course Felice absolutely hated me. 
<I>Hated </I> me. I think a lot of the problem had to do with the word 
"chocolatier." I just could never pronounce it to her satisfaction--in 
an introduction, for example. I realize it's a perfectly okay word, it's 
just not one I've had much occasion to use or am very comfortable with. 
Probably it bugged her that I always added "(French)" after it, to help 
people unfamiliar with its foreign 
origins.<P>
Liszt and Felice immediately got themselves his-and-hers matching 
everything. They pored over airline shopping catalogues and ordered 
expensive pen-and-pencil sets, executive stress-reducers, and pocket 
Breathalyzers, always by twos. In Dallas they bought identical luggage, 
which shouldn't have irritated me, but did. I came to dread seeing my own 
suitcase with the broken side zipper gaping forlornly amid their gleaming 
equipage on the baggage carousel. They always used porters--I prefer 
to carry mine--and they made out in taxicabs. Felice often recorded 
their conversations on a small tape recorder, which I noticed she turned 
off whenever I had something to say. Privately each told me how amazing 
and wonderful the other was. Of course all I could do was agree like an 
idiot.<P>
I think Felice would have preferred that I disappear; many times I felt as 
if I already had. In the green room of the Spokane Civic Theater she 
absentmindedly handed me a stack of manila envelopes meant for the UPS 
man--I looked just like him, she blithely explained. I could have 
taken the hint and gone for a walk around the block for about two weeks, 
but I chose to remain emphatically where I was. This was my tour too. To 
pass the time I paced and cleared my throat a lot and popped my knuckles, 
even though I knew how nuts that drove her. I sat reading my own book, 
occasionally chuckling at the good parts. Liszt remained oblivious of the 
daggers Felice now looked at me whenever I was in the vicinity. He thought 
she and I would be fast friends, coming from the same century and all. 
Mutual misunderstanding, already serious, deepened further.<P>

<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/A-small.gif" align=left height=44 
	alt="A">
     </font>t last I decided to get our conflicts out into the open. We were in the back of an airport limo, just the three of us, stuck 
in a traffic jam in Boise, Idaho, at seven o'clock in the morning. I 
looked out at the small creek of rainwater in the gutter, moving along 
faster than we were, and clarity seized me. "You know the real difference 
between you and me, Franz?" I asked. He turned to me with the smallest 
acceptable amount of polite interest on his seamed, subtle face, but I 
continued. "I am quirky. That is my essence--quirk. By that I mean I'm 
just <I>me </I>, a self that is completely my own <I>sui generis </I> 
individual kind of personality. I have my own take on things, which is 
always slightly skewed and edgy. This is reflected in my writing, which is 
quirky, skewed, et cetera, as well."<P>
I could see he had no idea what I was talking about. Felice, pretending to 
yawn and stretch, cuffed me on the side of the head.<P>
"That's <I>me </I>; whereas <I>you </I>," I went on, heedless, "you invented 
the symphonic poem, made the piano the equivalent of an entire orchestra, 
played for more people than any musician in history, donated vast sums to 
charity, composed masterpieces of tonal experimentation far ahead of their 
time--but, no offense, you're not quirky. I am much quirkier than you. 
You do have your own take on things, I admit, but it is skewed only 
slightly if at all, nowhere near as skewed as mine. And as for edgy, I am 
sorry to have to tell you this, but you are not edgy in the least. 
Brilliant? Yes. Edgy? No way. In fact, it's remarkable we've gotten along 
as well as we have."<P>
His sea-green eyes remained fixed on me in a look of complete bafflement. 
Later I found out that he had misheard me to say that I was "corky," and 
"corkier" than he was. Even if he'd heard me right, he wouldn't have 
understood. He came from a time when people actually had to know how to do 
stuff, or else they sat around all day burning peat or something, and 
there wasn't much call for high-end authors like me. I gave up trying to 
explain. But, oddly, Liszt didn't let the moment pass. He continued 
looking at me. Then he reached over, took my arm, and in that accent of 
his said, "Well, I'm sure you're a good egg!"<P>
Felice brought out her cell phone and pulled up the antenna and began 
calling vanilla suppliers. The traffic eased, the rain stopped, airport 
billboards appeared up ahead. Liszt rolled down the window and idly ran 
through some fingerings on his knee. I sat back in an unexpected rush of 
contentment. No, I'm being coy--ecstasy would be more like it, quiet 
ecstasy. Franz Liszt called <I>me</I> a good egg! And here I had never 
said even one nice thing about his piano playing. I'm nearly tone-deaf, to 
begin with, and my idea of good music is weepy early-eighties 
rock-and-roll that <I>nobody </I> likes nowadays, by bands with geographic 
place-names. What a perfect blurb for my next book: "'A good 
egg'--Franz Liszt." I still can't get over it. Felice finished her 
phone call and stowed her phone, and our glances met. The absence of a 
sneer on her beet-red lips could almost have been called a smile.<P>


<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/S-small.gif" align=left height=44 
	alt="S">
     </font>o I guess I have to take back some of what I've said. True, Liszt is a 
crazed egomaniac who believes that all the world is secondary to his 
towering genius. And true, he does sometimes trample the rights of others 
in the Preferred Customer lines, so you nearly get into fights. All the 
same, he's not a hundred percent bad. Old "Fist Full of Keys" Franz knows 
a lot more than he lets on. I mean, let's put ourselves in his position: 
he's been "dead" in a technical sense for more than a hundred years, and 
none of his friends are around anymore. He gets lonely. Of course he 
retreats into his celebrity and his music. Wouldn't you? Yet with all the 
sadness he has to keep bottled up, he still considers the other fellow's 
feelings--mine, for example. Soon after our exchange in the airport 
limo he invited me to sit in with him at a recording session at the 
studios of Deutsche Grammophon. Yes, that's me playing the triangle in the 
new version of <I>Danse Macabre </I>--you can just barely hear it. He 
wrote the part especially for me, and I was thrilled. We even jammed a 
little--after the tapes had stopped rolling, of course. He didn't have 
to do that, and I appreciated it. <P>
As for my book, it ended up selling pretty well, especially to people in 
the business. To my (pleasant) surprise, the publisher turned out to be 
right about the tour. Much as it graveled me always to be "the guy with 
Liszt," the backup interview, or the "In Brief" item or sidebar piece, I 
did get a decent amount of coverage out of the deal. Interviewers seemed 
to like it when I said that if I weren't a writer, I'd probably be either 
dead or in jail. I don't know why, but they always quoted that line, 
leaving out that it isn't really true. I personally know a lot of people 
who bought the book, sometimes more than one copy, and obviously there are 
many others I don't know about, which would increase the figure. I just 
received a royalty statement on the sales, but I won't go into a whole 
long analysis of it now. I'll merely mention that line seventeen of the 
statement, identified as "Line Fifteen Minus Line Sixteen," shows an 
amount over $7,000. That is either what I owe the publisher or what the 
publisher owes me--quite a respectable number for a work of fiction, 
in any event.<P>
Franz Liszt's place in history is already secure, and he will go on to 
make it even better. This time when he's reached his goals there won't be 
anyone who can touch him, ever. He and Felice just bought a place in 
Encino, and they divide their time between there and his native Hungary. 
He has a new tour planned, with race-car driver turned author Mario 
Andretti, which will be far bigger than the one I was on. They're looking 
at new venues on the NASCAR summer circuit, which would be way, way beyond 
my league but not beyond Liszt's, and more power to him. Having seen him 
myself in concert, I can promise that he owns the three essentials for any 
performer: he makes you laugh, he makes you cry, and he scares the hell 
out of you. No audience could ask for more. In Berlin back in 1841 people 
went so wild for him that they threw themselves under the wheels of his 
carriage--a trifle, I predict, compared with what's going to happen 
here. Despite everything that went down between him and me in the past, 
I'll be rooting for him all the way.<p>

	<font size=5>M</font>OST people remember the 1994 baseball season for the way it ended--with a
strike rather than a World Series. I keep thinking about the way it began. On
opening day, April 4, Bill Clinton went to Cleveland and, like many Presidents
before him, threw out a ceremonial first pitch. That same day Hillary Rodham
Clinton went to Chicago and, like no First Lady before her, also threw out a
first ball, at a Cubs game in Wrigley Field.<p>
<img src="Sports.gif" align=center hspace=10 
vspace=10> <br>
The next day photos of the Clintons in action appeared in newspapers around the
country. Many papers, including <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Washington
Post</i>, chose the same two photos to run. The one of Bill Clinton showed him
wearing an Indians cap and warm-up jacket. The President, throwing lefty, had
turned his shoulders sideways to the plate in preparation for delivery. He was
bringing the ball forward from behind his head in a clean-looking throwing
action as the photo was snapped. Hillary Clinton was pictured wearing a dark
jacket, a scarf, and an oversized Cubs hat. In preparation for her throw she
was standing directly facing the plate. A right-hander, she had the elbow of
her throwing arm pointed out in front of her. Her forearm was tilted back,
toward her shoulder. The ball rested on her upturned palm. As the picture was
taken, she was in the middle of an action that can only be described as
throwing like a girl.<p>

The phrase "throwing like a girl" has become an embattled and offensive one.
Feminists smart at its implication that to do something "like a girl" is to do
it the wrong way. Recently, on the heels of the O. J. Simpson case, a book
appeared in which the phrase was used to help explain why male athletes,
especially football players, were involved in so many assaults against women.
Having been trained (like most American boys) to dread the accusation of doing
anything "like a girl," athletes were said to grow into the assumption that
women were valueless, and natural prey.<p>

I grant the justice of such complaints. I am attuned to the hurt caused by
similar broad-brush stereotypes when they apply to groups I belong to--"dancing
like a white man," for instance, or "speaking foreign languages like an
American," or "thinking like a Washingtonian."<p>

Still, whatever we want to call it, the difference between the two Clintons in
what they were doing that day is real, and it is instantly recognizable. And
since seeing those photos I have been wondering, Why, exactly, do so many women
throw "like a girl"? If the motion were easy to change, presumably a woman as
motivated and self-possessed as Hillary Clinton would have changed it.
(According to her press secretary, Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton spent the weekend
before opening day tossing a ball in the Rose Garden with her husband, for
practice.) Presumably, too, the answer to the question cannot be anything quite
as simple as, Because they <i>are </i>girls.<p>

A surprising number of people think that there is a structural difference
between male and female arms or shoulders--in the famous "rotator cuff,"
perhaps--that dictates different throwing motions. "It's in the shoulder
joint," a well-educated woman told me recently. "They're hinged differently."
Someday researchers may find evidence to support a biological theory of
throwing actions. For now, what you'll hear if you ask an orthopedist, an
anatomist, or (especially) the coach of a women's softball team is that there
is no structural reason why men and women should throw in different ways. This
point will be obvious to any male who grew up around girls who liked to play
baseball and became good at it. It should be obvious on a larger scale this
summer, in broadcasts of the Olympic Games. This year, for the first time,
<A HREF="http://www.atlanta.olympic.org/acog/sports/softball/d-SB-3.html">women's fast-pitch softball</A> teams will compete in the Olympics. Although the
pitchers in these games will deliver the ball underhand, viewers will see
female shortstops, center fielders, catchers, and so on pegging the ball to one
another at speeds few male viewers could match.<p>

Even women's tennis is a constant if indirect reminder that men's and women's
shoulders are "hinged" the same way. The serving motion in tennis is like a
throw--but more difficult, because it must be coordinated with the toss of the
tennis ball. The men in professional tennis serve harder than the women,
because they are bigger and stronger. But women pros serve harder than most
male amateurs have ever done, and the service motion for good players is the
same for men and women alike. There is no expectation in college or pro tennis
that because of their anatomy female players must "serve like a girl." "I know
many women who can throw a lot harder and better than the normal male," says
Linda Wells, the coach of the highly successful women's softball team at
Arizona State University. "It's not gender that makes the difference in how
they throw."<p>
<br>
	<font size=5>S</font>O what is it, then? Since Hillary Clinton's ceremonial visit to Wrigley Field,
I have asked men and women how they learned to throw, or didn't. Why did I
care? My impetus was the knowledge that eventually my sons would be grown and
gone. If my wife, in all other ways a talented athlete, could learn how to
throw, I would still have someone to play catch with. My research left some
women, including my wife, thinking that I am some kind of obsessed lout, but it
has led me to the solution to the mystery. First let's be clear about what
there is to be explained.<p>
At a superficial level it's easy to tick off the traits of an awkward-looking
throw. The fundamental mistake is the one Mrs. Clinton appeared to be making in
the photo: trying to throw a ball with your body facing the target, rather than
rotating your shoulders and hips ninety degrees away from the target and then
swinging them around in order to accelerate the ball. A throw looks bad if your
elbow is lower than your shoulder as your arm comes forward (unless you're
throwing sidearm). A throw looks really bad if, as the ball leaves your hand,
your wrist is "inside your elbow"--that is, your elbow joint is bent in such a
way that your forearm angles back toward your body and your wrist is closer to
your head than your elbow is. Slow-motion film of big-league pitchers shows
that when they release the ball, the throwing arm is fully extended and
straight from shoulder to wrist. The combination of these three
elements--head-on stance, dropped elbow, and wrist inside the
elbow--mechanically dictates a pushing rather than a hurling motion, creating
the familiar pattern of "throwing like a girl."<p>

It is surprisingly hard to find in the literature of baseball a deeper
explanation of the mechanics of good and bad throws. Tom Seaver's pitching for
the Mets and the White Sox got him into the Hall of Fame, but his book <i>The
Art of Pitching </i>is full of bromides that hardly clarify the process of
throwing, even if they might mean something to accomplished pitchers. His
chapter "The Absolutes of Pitching Mechanics," for instance, lays out these
four unhelpful principles: "Keep the Front Leg Flexible!" "Rub Up the
Baseball." "Hide the Baseball!" "Get it Out, Get it Up!" (The fourth refers to
the need to get the ball out of the glove and into the throwing hand in a quick
motion.)<p>

A variety of other instructional documents, from <i>Little League's Official
How-to-Play Baseball Book </i>to <i>Softball for Girls &amp; Women</i>, mainly
reveal the difficulty of finding words to describe a simple motor activity that
everyone can recognize. The challenge, I suppose, is like that of writing a
manual on how to ride a bike, or how to kiss. Indeed, the most useful
description I've found of the mechanics of throwing comes from a man whose
specialty is another sport: Vic Braden made his name as a tennis coach, but he
has attempted to analyze the physics of a wide variety of sports so that they
all will be easier to teach.<p>

Braden says that an effective throw involves connecting a series of links in a
"kinetic chain." The kinetic chain, which is Braden's tool for analyzing most
sporting activity, operates on a principle like that of crack-the-whip.
Momentum builds up in one part of the body. When that part is suddenly stopped,
as the end of the "whip" is stopped in crack-the-whip, the momentum is
transferred to and concentrated in the next link in the chain. A good throw
uses six links of chain, Braden says. The first two links involve the lower
body, from feet to waist. The first motion of a throw (after the body has been
rotated away from the target) is to rotate the legs and hips back in the
direction of the throw, building up momentum as large muscles move body mass.
Then those links stop--a pitcher stops turning his hips once they face the
plate--and the momentum is transferred to the next link. This is the torso,
from waist to shoulders, and since its mass is less than that of the legs,
momentum makes it rotate faster than the hips and legs did. The torso stops
when it is facing the plate, and the momentum is transferred to the next
link--the upper arm. As the upper arm comes past the head, it stops moving
forward, and the momentum goes into the final links--the forearm and wrist,
which snap forward at tremendous speed.<p>

This may sound arcane and jerkily mechanical, but it makes perfect sense when
one sees Braden's slow-mo movies of pitchers in action. And it explains why
people do, or don't, learn how to throw. The implication of Braden's analysis
is that throwing is a perfectly natural action (millions and millions of people
can do it), but not at all innate. A successful throw involves an intricate
series of actions coordinated among muscle groups, as each link of the chain is
timed to interact with the next. Like bike riding or skating, it can be learned
by anyone--male or female. No one starts out knowing how to ride a bike or
throw a ball. Everyone has to learn.<p>

Readers who are happy with their throwing skills can prove this to themselves
in about two seconds. If you are right-handed, pick up a ball with your left
hand and throw it. Unless you are ambidextrous or have some other odd
advantage, you will throw it "like a girl." The problem is not that your left
shoulder is hinged strangely or that you don't know what a good throw looks
like. It is that you have not spent time training your leg, hip, shoulder, and
arm muscles on that side to work together as required for a throw. The actor
John Goodman, who played football seriously and baseball casually when he was
in high school, is right-handed. When cast in the 1992 movie <i>The Babe</i>,
he had to learn to bat and throw left-handed, for realism in the role of Babe
Ruth. For weeks before the filming began, he would arrive an hour early at the
set of his TV show, <i>Roseanne</i>, so that he could practice throwing a
tennis ball against a wall left-handed. "I made damn sure no one could see me,"
Goodman told me recently. "I'm hard enough on myself without the derisive
laughter of my so-called friends." When <i>The Babe</i> was released, Goodman
told a newspaper interviewer, "I'll never say something like 'He throws like a
girl' again. It's not easy to learn how to throw."<p>
<br>

	<font size=5>W</font>HAT
Goodman discovered is what most men have forgotten: that if they know how 
to throw now, it is because they spent time learning at some point long 
ago. (Goodman says that he can remember learning to ride a bicycle but not 
learning to throw with his right hand.) This brings us back to the roots of 
the "throwing like a girl" phenomenon.  The crucial factor is not that 
males and females are put together differently but that they typically 
spend their early years in different ways. Little boys often learn to 
throw without noticing that they are throwing. Little girls are more rarely 
in environments that encourage them in the same way.  A boy who wonders 
why a girl throws the way she does is like a Frenchman who wonders why so 
many Americans speak French "with an accent."<p>

"For young boys it is culturally acceptable and politically correct to develop
these skills," says Linda Wells, of the Arizona State softball team. "They are
mentored and networked. Usually girls are not coached at all, or are coached by
Mom--or if it's by Dad, he may not be much of an athlete. Girls are often stuck
with the bottom of the male talent pool as examples. I would argue that rather
than learning to 'throw like a girl,' they learn to throw like poor male
athletes. I say that a bad throw is 'throwing like an old man.' This is not
gender, it's acculturation."<p>

Almost any motor skill, from doing handstands to dribbling a basketball, is
easier to learn if you start young, which is why John Goodman did not realize
that learning to throw is difficult until he attempted it as an adult. Many
girls reach adulthood having missed the chance to learn to throw when that
would have been easiest to do. And as adults they have neither John Goodman's
incentive to teach their muscles a new set of skills nor his confidence that
the feat is possible. Five years ago Joseph Russo, long a baseball coach at St.
John's University, gave athletic-talent tests to actresses who were trying out
for roles in <i>A League of Their Own</i>, a movie about women's baseball. Most
of them were "well coordinated in general, like for dancing," he says. But
those who had not happened to play baseball or softball when they were young
had a problem: "It sounds silly to say it, but they kept throwing like girls."
(The best ball-field talents, by the way, were Madonna, Demi Moore, and the
rock singer Joan Jett, who according to Russo "can really hit it hard." Careful
viewers of <i>A League of Their Own </i>will note that only in a fleeting
instant in one scene is the star, Geena Davis, shown actually throwing a
ball.)<p>

I'm not sure that I buy Linda Wells's theory that most boys are "mentored" or
"networked" into developing ball skills. Those who make the baseball team,
maybe. But for a far larger number the decisive ingredient seems to be the
hundreds of idle hours spent throwing balls, sticks, rocks, and so on in the
playground or the back yard. Children on the playground, I think, demonstrate
the moment when the kinetic chain begins to work. It is when a little boy tries
to throw a rock farther than his friend can, or to throw a stick over a
telephone wire thirty feet up. A toddler's first, instinctive throw is a push
from the shoulder, showing the essential traits of "throwing like a girl." But
when a child is really trying to put some oomph into the throw, his natural
instinct is to wind up his body and let fly with the links of the chain. Little
girls who do the same thing--compete with each other in distance
throwing--learn the same way; but whereas many boys do this, few girls do.
Tammy Richards, a woman who was raised on a farm in central California, says
that she learned to throw by trying to heave dried cow chips farther than her
brother could. It may have helped that her father, Bob Richards, was a former
Olympic competitor in the decathlon (and two-time Olympic champion in the pole
vault), and that he taught all his sons and daughters to throw not only the
ball but also the discus, the shotput, and the javelin.<p>
<br>
 	<font size=5>I</font>S there a way to make up for lost time if you failed to invest those long
hours on the playground years ago? Of course. Adults may not be able to learn
to speak unaccented French, but they can learn to ride a bike, or skate, or
throw. All that is required for developing any of these motor skills is time
for practice--and spending that time requires overcoming the sense of
embarrassment and futility that adults often have when attempting something
new. Here are two tips that may help.<p>
One is a surprisingly valuable drill suggested by the Little League's
<i>How-to-Play </i>handbook. Play catch with a partner who is ten or fifteen
feet away--but do so while squatting with the knee of your throwing side
touching the ground. When you start out this low, you have to keep the throw
high to get the ball to your partner without bouncing it. This encourages a
throw with the elbow held well above the shoulder, where it belongs.<p>

The other is to play catch with a person who can throw like an athlete but is
using his or her off hand. The typical adult woman hates to play catch with the
typical adult man. She is well aware that she's not looking graceful, and
reacts murderously to the condescending tone in his voice ("That's more like
it, honey!"). Forcing a right-handed man to throw left-handed is the great
equalizer. He suddenly concentrates his attention on what it takes to get hips,
shoulder, and elbow working together. He is suddenly aware of the strength of
character needed to ignore the snickers of onlookers while learning new motor
skills. He can no longer be condescending. He may even be nervous, wondering
what he'll do if his partner makes the breakthrough first and he's the one
still throwing like a girl.

<h2>From "Heart of Darkness" (1902) <p>

<font size=4>by Joseph Conrad</font></h2>

<p>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>

Going up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings of the
world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings.  An
empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest.  The air was warm,
thick, heavy, sluggish.  There was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine.  The
long stretches of the waterway ran on, deserted, into the gloom of overshadowed
distances.  On silvery sandbanks hippos and alligators sunned themselves side
by side.  The broadening waters flowed through a mob of wooded islands; you
lost your way on that river as you would in a desert, and butted all day long
against shoals, trying to find the channel, till you thought yourself bewitched
and cut off forever from everything you had known once -- somewhere -- far away
-- in another existence perhaps.  There were moments when one's past came back
to one, as it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare to yourself;
but it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream, remembered with
wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this strange world of plants, and
water, and silence.  And this stillness of life did not in the least resemble a
peace.  It was the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an
inscrutable intention.  It looked at you with a vengeful aspect.<p>

<center><b>
* * * * *<p>
</b></center>

On we went again into the silence, along empty reaches, round the still bends,
between the high walls of our winding way, reverberating in hollow claps the
ponderous beat of the stern wheel.  Trees, trees, millions of trees, massive,
immense, running up high; and at their foot, hugging the bank against the
stream, crept the little begrimed steamboat, like a sluggish beetle crawling on
the floor of a lofty portico.  It made you feel very small, very lost, and yet
it was not altogether depressing, that feeling.  After all, if you were small,
the grimy beetle crawled on -- which was just what you wanted it to do. <p>

<center><b>
* * * * *<p>
</b></center>

The reaches opened before us and closed behind, as if the forest had stepped
leisurely across the water to bar the way for our return.  We penetrated deeper
and deeper into the heart of darkness.  It was very quiet in there. . . .  The
dawns were heralded by the descent of a chill stillness. <nobr>. . .</nobr>  We were
wanderers on prehistoric earth, and on an earth that wore the aspect of an
unknown planet. <nobr>. . .</nobr> The steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black
and incomprehensible frenzy. <nobr>. . .</nobr>  We were cut off from comprehension of our
surroundings; we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as
sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse.  We could not
understand because we were too far and could not remember, because we were
traveling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are gone, leaving
hardly a sign -- and no memories.  <p>

<p>

The earth seemed unearthly.  We are accustomed to look upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster, but there -- there you could look at a thing monstrous
and free.  It was unearthly, and the men were -- No, they were not 
inhuman.  Well, you know, that was the worst of it -- this suspicion of 
their not being inhuman.  It would come slowly to one.  They howled and 
leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just the 
thought of their humanity -- like yours -- the thought of your remote 
kinship with this wild and passionate uproar.  Ugly.  Yes, it was ugly 
enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself
that there was in your just the faintest trace of a response to the 
terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in 
it which
you -- you so remote from the night of the first ages -- could comprehend.<p>

<B>From <i>Through the Dark  Continent</i> (1878):</B> <p>

<img src="Banks.gif" width=185 height=120 border=1 vspace=5 
hspace=15 align=left>Looking from the house, my eyes rested on the river.  Ah! the hateful,
murderous river, so broad and proud and majestically calm, as though it had not
bereft me of a friend, and of many faithful souls, and as though we had never
heard it rage and whiten with fury, and mock the thunder.  What a hypocritical
river!  But just below the landing a steamer was ascending -- the
<i>Kabinda</i>, John Petherbridge, master.  How civilization was advancing on
me!  Not a moment even to lie down and rest!  Full-blooded, eager, restless,
and aggressive, it pressed on me, and claimed me for its own, without allowing
me even the time to cast one retrospective glance at the horrors left behind.
While still overwhelmed by the thought, the people of the Expedition appeared,
pressing forward to admire and gaze wide-eyed at the strange "big iron canoe
driven by fire" on <i>their</i> river; for there were several Wanyamwezi,
Waganda, and east coast men who would not believe that there was anything more
wonderful than the <i>Lady Alice</i>."

Beyond the village was low forested land,
which either came in dense black towering masses of impenetrable vegetation to
the waterside, or else ran in great semicircles half enclosing grassy flats,
whereon hippopotami fed at night time.<p>

The Congo was now enormously wide. <nobr>. . .</nobr>  Few could imagine that a slow ascent
up the Congo in steamers going only two and a half knots against the current of
the great river could be otherwise than monotonous.  <img src="Map.gif" 
width=240 
height=152 border=1 vspace=5 
hspace=15 align=right>Taken as a whole, the
scenery of the Upper Congo is uninteresting; perhaps the very slow rate of
ascent has left that impression. <nobr>. . .</nobr>  We sighed for change . . . we are
menaced with <nobr>. . .</nobr> <i>ennui</i>.<nobr>. . .</nobr>  As for your own fancies, during this
day trance, created mainly by what you see as the banks glide steadily past,
who will dare to fathom them?  They come in rapid succession on the mind, in
various shapes, rank after rank.  Unsteadfast as the grey clouds which you see
to the westward, they pile into cities, and towns, and mountains, growing ever
larger, more intense, but still ever wavering and undergoing quick transitions
of form.  The flowing river, the vast dome of sky; the aspiring clouds on the
horizon; the purpling blue, as well as the dark spectral isles of the stream;
the sepulchral gloom beneath the impervious forest foliage; those swaying
reeds; that expanse of sere-coloured grassy plain; that grey clay bank,
speckled with the red roots of some shrub; that narrow pathway through the
forest -- all suggest some new thought, some fancy which cannot be long
pursued, since it is constantly supplanted by other ideas suggested by
something new, which itself is but a momentary flash.<p>

Meantime, at dusk, each steamer's crew of white officers and passengers 
<img src="StaChief.gif" width=170 height=202 border=1 vspace=5 
hspace=15 align=left> will be
found around their dinner-tables on deck or on the bank, if the camp has
permitted it. <nobr>. . .</nobr>  Of food there is abundance, but not much variety.  It may
comprise soup of beans or vegetables, followed by toasted chikwanga
(cassava-bread), fried or stewed fowl, a roast fowl, or a roast leg of goat
meat, a dish of dessicated potatoes, or yams, roast bananas, boiled beans, rice
and curry, or rices with honey, or rice and milk, finishing with tea or coffee,
or palm-wine. <nobr>. . .</nobr>  A few months of this diet makes the European sigh for his
<i>petit verre</i>, Astrachan caviar, mock-turtle, salmon -- with sauce
Hollandaise -- <i>filet de boeuf</i>, with perhaps a <i>pastete</i> and <i>poularde
mit comp&ocirc;te und salat</i>. <nobr>. . .</nobr>  How glorious a view of Congo life one
could take when exhilarated by half a pint of champagne. <nobr>. . .</nobr>  It is only a
grand moral manhood like Livingstone's that rises above these petty vanities of
a continental stomach.  Think of his thirty-two years' life in Africa, and of
the unsophisticated mannikins who to-day are digging their eyes out with
weeping at the memories of a European restaurant before they have been scarcely
three months out!<p>

As we anticipated, the natives soon came up, <img src="Caravan.gif" width=145 
height=172 border=1 vspace=5 
hspace=15 align=right> and fowls, goats, ripe and green
plantains and bananas, cassava rolls, cassava flour, sweet potatoes, yams,
eggs, and palm oil were bartered so speedily that by sunset we had sufficient
to last two or three days. <nobr>. . .</nobr>  At sunrise the following day canoe after
canoe appeared, and the barter was so successfully conducted that we had soon
secured three dozen fowls, four goats, a sheep, and eight days' rations for
each member of the coloured force.  The fear the natives entertained of the
strange steamer was now changed for liveliest admiration.  We were no longer
supposed to be laden with mischief, but full of "good things."<p>

sighing after adventure, volunteers his services, and sails hopefully to the
Congo.  He is evidently in splendid health on his arrival, but what to do with
that priceless blessing, which has been, if possible, bettered by the long sea
voyage, he knows no more (if the Darwinian theory is right) than his
long-tailed progenitor.  He has heard that it is slightly warm on the Congo --
at least, so the meteorologists say; but in Europe, he smiled at this; thought
he could well endure that heat, since Europe in summer was "ever so much
hotter."  Still, after the ship drops anchor in Banana Creek, an uncomfortable
quantity of perspiration exudes through the pores of his skin, and the flannels
that were endurable at sea become almost intolerable.  <img src="Bateke.gif" width=75 
height=200 border=1 vspace=5 
hspace=15 align=left>On stepping ashore this
warmth increases, the flannels absorb the perspiration until they are wet and
heavy, and cling uncomfortably to his body.  The underclothes are full; the
outward clothing has begun to be damp, and dark streaks along the seams of his
coat show that they are actually wet, until in fact he represents a water-jug
covered with wet flannel such as we sling up in the tropics as a
water-cooler. <nobr>. . .</nobr><p>

<p>

No one would offer water to a stranger, but wine, schnapps, beer, gin,
seltzer, &amp;c. <nobr>. . .</nobr>  See the unsophisticated home-bred youth, how bashfully
he accepts!  Is he not in Congo-land?  Why may he not ape the moustached and
brave manhood about him?  "I will take wine, if you please."  Thanks! and a
glass of black-red Portuguese wine is handed to him, which after trial he
discovers to be more potent than a bottle of champagne. . . .<p>

<p>

The ill-fated youth has enjoyed his dinner and potent wine, and a comfortable
arm-chair receives his repleted form.  The night is cool, and gracious, and
bland; the stars shine brightly, but there is an unaccountable chilliness in
the air. <nobr>. . .</nobr>  At last he seeks the couch offered him by the hospitable
trader, on which he tosses about till cockcrow with disturbed dreams.  
<img src="Langa.gif" 
width=120 height=143 border=1 vspace=5 
hspace=15 align=right>In the
morning he feels unwell; his tongue is furred, and a strange lassitude has
taken possession of him.  This feeling grows into a nauseous sickness.  He is
visited about the time of <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, and is discovered with
flushed face, watery eyes and a rapid pulse, and declared to have a fever!<p>

Then there is the medicating of the sick man in a rude unskilful way, and a 
rough but kindly nursing of him.  But the personal attendant is a black 
negro, to whom the white man is an absolute stranger.  The scene ends after 
a few days with convalescence perhaps, and a slow recovery, or, in an 
extreme case, with death, when the body will be interred at the Point among 
the remains of the other unfortunates. <nobr>. . .</nobr>  Truly it is extremely 
discouraging to feel that of the twenty other young or mature gentlemen who 
may have seen this youth <nobr>. . .</nobr> there is not one of them can make an 
approachable guess at the real cause which cut him off so prematurely.  Each 
will have his opinion. <nobr>. . .</nobr> all mere surmises, as far opposite to the 
truth as the truth is to lying!<p>

The fever was caused by sitting in his wet flannels in the cold night air.
