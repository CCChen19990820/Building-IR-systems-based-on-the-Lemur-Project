<H1>Getting In Touch with the Revolution</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin and Elizabeth Black</I>
</CENTER>
<P>By now, most practitioners have heard about the so-called Comfort Shoe Revolution. But understanding how the biomechanics mainstream can dramatically influence this revolution requires more than casual awareness. It takes involvement on a grass-roots level.
<P>What is the Comfort Shoe Revolution? It is the shoe buying public getting fed up with ill-fitting shoes even as the shoe manufacturing and retailing communities respond to that demand with better fitting and more stylish shoes. The impact on the patient base can be profound. Millions of Americans are suffering from bad shoes and even worse shoe buying habits. So much misery is caused by the cumulative effects of cruel shoes, certificates for surgery discounts should come in the box. But all that is now changing. Here's how you can help.
<P>First, become aware of your patient's shoe buying and shoe wearing practices. If the right shoes are worn for the wrong activities, there will be problems. Hiking, boating, sports or training, heavy lifting, prolonged standing, winter sloshing--each of these activities has an appropriate shoe type that will deal with the factors confronting shoewear: moisture, shock, support, traction, an orthosis, to mention just a few. But not everyone owns a shoerack with the latest in well constructed footgear. 
<P>Compression is an issue. Is the sock too thick? Does the orthosis fit? Is a replacement insole in order?
<P>Second, become central to your patient's upcoming shoe purchases. Guiding that next purchase is virtually preventative medicine. If you have confidence in a shoe brand or model, recommend it to your patient. Remember, not all models of a given manufacturer are recommended. Don't refer to just SAS or Rockport; specify the model.
<P>Third, teach your patients how to purchase shoes. Patients must become discriminating customers. Teach them to get their feet measured periodically and to shop for widths as well as lengths. Tell them to reject notions about a shoe fitting "after it's broken in." The shoe must fit from the very first day. Most of all, teach patients to avoid last minute shopping. Everyone does it--you need shoes for a wedding this weekend. But it's a bad habit that we must break for ourselves and for the retailers. Last minute shopping leads to compromise fitting. We've all heard it: "I have it in a size 10, but not a 10 1/2." Patients must learn to special order and to brush aside sales clerk refusals to special order. That requires both customer knowledge and patience.
<P>Fourth, scope out the recommended retail channels. When a store is sensitive to the Comfort Shoe Revolution, they should be rewarded with your recommendation. This is something shoe retailers very much want, so it's up to you to take the lead. A brochure from you offering 10 tips to intelligent shoe buying with the local store agreeing to endorse those points would help advance the cause of properly fitting shoes. 
<P>Fifth, teach the retailers. Sales clerks often just don't know the first thing about shoe construction or health needs. And chances are, neither does your new office assistant. Share your knowledge and your preferences so the channels can adopt them. Offer to teach local seminars to salespeople. And make them know that your practice cares about their customers and your patients. Participate in local health fairs where comfort shoe retailers are present and thereby increase your opportunity to educate consumers. If there is a qualified pedorthist in the neighborhood, form a dialogue. A healthy symbiotic relationship can exist between the comfort retailer and the local practice as well. Both office and store can return the recommendation. Just be careful not to endorse a store for the sake of a store's referral. All of this also serves as a practice building campaign. 
<P>Sixth, sharpen and enhance your knowledge of the industry. Once upon a time, when a foot and ankle specialist heard the word comfort he thought of two names: Rockport and SAS. That is now changing. The field is becoming crowded with stylish, comfort shoes--Converse, Ecco, Etonic, Easy Spirit, Lowell, Mephisto, Nike, Reebok, Timberland, and many more. Comfort is now the fastest growing segment of the footwear market. Remember that the more stylish the comfort shoe, the more appealing the shoe will be to your patient. So seek out style.
<P>Standards for comfort shoes are sorely lacking, but three organizations have shown leadership in tackling the problem. The American Podiatric Medical Association's long-standing Seal of Acceptance evaluates shoes through a special committee process. A manufacturer submits a shoe along with documentation for its comfort claims to the APMA's Medical Office. After all questions are satisfactorily answered, the Medical Officer submits the shoe to seven leading podiatrists for hands-on evaluation. They reach a consensus recommendation which is then sent on to the APMA Board of Trustees for a final decision.
<P>Perhaps the most quantitative comfort rating ever is the Comfort Index developed by SATRA, the world's largest footwear research organization headquartered in England. SATRA considers all its work confidential and reports its findings only to member associations or shoe companies. A shoe is submitted to three batteries of rigidly structured, anecdotal tests under lab conditions. A 63 to 70 point overall rating is considered highly desirable.
<P>The newest seal is one just announced by the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society, which will attempt to introduce structured testing into the comfort field.
<P>Wearing comfort shoes today can mean avoiding therapeutic shoes tomorrow. Wearing and using shoes intelligently can mean avoiding pain and injury. Getting in touch with the Comfort Shoe Revolution is not just a matter of fashion. It's a matter of foot health.

<H1>Post-Operative Footwear</H1>
<P><I>by Harold D. Schoenhaus, DPM</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Since a majority of foot and ankle surgeries are now performed with early mobilization in mind, postoperative footwear has become a crucial factor in patient recuperation. Several recent modifications to the postoperative shoe include a slightly elevated forefoot that fosters some propulsive activity. Other changes include a platform type of shoe that prevents weightbearing on the forefoot.
<P>Generally speaking, a postoperative shoe must support the foot while protecting it from further injury. Weight distribution across all aspects of the foot is another important function. If surgical dressings have been applied, a shoe must be able to accommodate the added bulk. The sole of the postoperative shoe is of a rigid material, while the upper is rather loose, fastening either with laces or Velcro straps. The shoe itself is made to accommodate various bandage types and the size of the patient's foot. Depending upon the procedure performed and the patient's recovery period, the shoe is generally worn until the operating surgeon feels the patient is able to don a different type of foot gear. Since edema may be a factor even after postoperative footwear has been discontinued, patients often move to an intermediate size shoe before returning to their normal footwear. In the performance of certain osteotomies, which are inherently stable, a rigid sole is used as a substitute for cast immobilization. The amount of weightbearing applied to part of or to the entire foot will be based upon the operating surgeon's judgement.
<P>Since postoperative footwear possess a rigid sole, mobility about the foot and ankle is restricted and normal ambulation is hindered. Immediately following surgery, this may be desired. However, as the patient continues to wear a rigid sole, this lack of mobility in the foot and ankle can contribute to postoperative swelling. This does not mean patients should stop wearing a protective shoe prematurely. It is, however, critically important to allow the patient to attain mobility as soon as possible.
<P>In my experience, edema is often a necessary by-product of postoperative shoes. Primarily, such edema occurs when immobile muscles lose their "milking" action, which is the ability to drive soft tissue fluids from the foot into a more proximal position. In addition to the loss of mobility and normal walking pattern, clogging may occur within the veins of the lower leg, which can lead to phlebitic syndrome. Patients who wear postoperative shoes should be instructed on performing ankle exercises in a non-weightbearing position to prevent venous stasis and poor lymphatic drainage.
<P>When surgical procedures are performed at the first metatarsal phalangeal joint with minimal osteotomies at the first ray, motion of the great toe joint should be started as soon as possible. With osteotomies of the first metatarsal head and neck region, stabilized with screw fixation, weightbearing at the site of the osteotomy is often permitted. Following hallux valgus and bunion procedures, it is vitally important that range of motion at the great toe joint be initiated as soon as possible to minimize edema and scarring.
<P>One of the trade-offs involved with a rigid sole shoe is that the ability to flex the toe at the metatarsal phalangeal joint is virtually nonexistent. With a rocker shoe that is slanted in a dorsiflexion direction at its distal portion, some motion may be obtained in the dorsiflexion direction. In cases where early motion is desired, the postoperative shoe should be discarded as soon as possible, allowing the patient to return to a flexible sole shoe to accommodate for proper flexion of the great toe joint. 
<P>Occasionally, pockets of edema will develop on the dorsum of the patient's foot just distal to a shoe's Velcro straps or laces. These pockets may cause additional discomfort if surgical procedures were performed in those particular locations, and can certainly delay progress back to normal footwear. Moreover, leg muscles may atrophy because of the  foot's inability during gait to pass from a contact phase into a midstance and eventual propulsive phase of walking.
<P>While most postoperative shoes are of a relatively standard thickness, they do not duplicate the heel height of normal footwear. Patients should be advised to replicate the height of the shoe as closely as possible to minimize, if not avoid, unnecessary discrepancies in limb length which can lead to knee, hip, and low back pain.
<P>Due to the construction of and materials used in postoperative footwear, shock absorption is less than ideal, a factor that can lead to heel pain and postal symptoms commonly associated with poor shock absorption. To counter this, cushions fabricated from materials such as Poron can be placed inside the shoe to enhance shock absorption. It may, in fact, be important to utilize a temporary orthosis directly in the shoe, which will supplement foot and arch support as well as enhance comfort.
<P>Many practitioners have come to view the postoperative shoe as a necessary evil following foot and ankle reconstruction. Utilizing such footwear often presents the practitioner with, ideally, a manageable trade off--edema and restricted range of motion in exchange for a more rapid return to normal footwear and ambulation.
<P>Two primary conclusions can be made regarding postoperative shoes. First, better construction is still needed. A shoe that closely mimics the normal walking cycle while still providing stability and support for the postoperative foot is ideal. Certainly, this is addressed to the patient who is able to bear weight. Secondly, operating surgeons should encourage their patients to return to a more flexible shoe as soon as possible based upon the surgical procedures performed and, again, the patient's ability to bear weight. Sneakers are one of the most acceptable forms of postoperative foot gear because their loose construction tends to accommodate bandaging and provide stability, while maintaining the flexibility necessary to allow for a more normal functioning foot and leg.

<H1>Shoe Modifications</H1>
<P><I>by Dennis J. Janisse, C.Ped</I>
</CENTER>
<P>An often neglected aspect of prescription footwear is external shoe modification. While they may not receive much attention, such modifications as rocker soles, stabilization, extended steel shanks, cushion heels, and extensions can be helpful for a wide variety of foot problems. 
<H2>Rocker Soles</H2>
As its name suggests, the basic function of a rocker sole is to literally "rock" the foot from heel-strike to toe-off, without bending the shoe. The biomechanical effects of a rocker sole restore lost motion in the foot and/or ankle and relieve pressure on some area of the plantar surface. There are two terms relevant to a discussion of rocker soles: the midstance, or the portion of the rocker sole that is in contact with the floor when in a standing position; and the apex, or high point, of the rocker sole, located at the distal end of the midstance.
<P>In general, rocker soles are custom-made for each patient. However, six basic types of rocker soles can be identified based on the variation of position and the degree of the rocker angle.
<P><B>1. Mild rocker sole.</B> The most widely used and most basic of the rocker soles has a mild angle at both the heel and the toe. This type of rocker sole can relieve metatarsal pressure and may assist gait by increasing propulsion and reducing energy expenditure when walking. It is appropriate for the foot which is not at risk and is typically found on athletic walking shoes.
<P><B>2. Heel-to-toe rocker sole.</B> Shaped with a more severe angle at both the heel and the toe, the heel-to-toe rocker is intended to provide a greater propulsion at toe-off, decrease heel-strike forces on the calcaneus, and decrease the need for ankle motion. The heel-to-toe rocker sole is appropriate for a fixed claw toe, rigid hammertoe, midfoot amputation, calcaneal ulcers, or for the patient who has undergone a triple arthrodesis.
<P><B>3. Toe-only rocker sole.</B> The purpose of a toe-only rocker sole is to increase weightbearing behind the metatarsal heads, provide a stable midstance, and reduce the need for toe dorsiflexion. With a rocker angle only at the toe and the midstance extending to the back end of the sole, it is useful for hallux rigidus, hammertoes, and metatarsal ulcers associated with diabetes.
<P><B>4. Severe angle rocker sole.</B> This type of sole also has a rocker angle only at the toe, but at a much more severe angle than that found on the toe-only rocker sole. The purpose of the severe rocker angle at the toe is to eliminate the weightbearing forces anterior to the metatarsal heads and is most often used for extreme relief of diabetic ulcers on the metatarsal heads.
<P><B>5. Negative heel rocker sole.</B> Shaped with a rocker angle at the toe and a negative heel, this type of rocker sole results in the patient's heel being at the same height or lower than the ball of the foot when in a standing position. The purpose of the negative heel rocker sole is to accommodate a foot that is fixed in dorsiflexion, or to relieve forefoot pressure by shifting it to the hindfoot and midfoot, for example, following surgery for Morton's neuroma. Since forefoot pressure relief is accomplished through the use of a negative heel, the thickness of the negative heel rocker sole is minimized, increasing overall stability of the shoe. It is therefore helpful for patients who feel unstable with the normal height of a rocker sole. The negative heel rocker sole is to be used with caution, however, since inability to attain the necessary ankle dorsiflexion will cause discomfort and may increase pressure on the problem area.
<P><B>6. Double rocker sole.</B> This is a mild rocker sole with a section removed in the midfoot area, thereby giving the appearance of two rocker soles--one at the hindfoot and one at the forefoot--and two areas of midstance. Since the thinnest area of the double rocker sole is at the midfoot, it is used to relieve a specific midfoot problem area, such as the Charcot foot deformity associated with diabetes.
<H2>Stabilization</H2>
Another important external modification is stabilization. Stabilization involves the addition of material to the medial or lateral portion of the shoe to stabilize some part of the foot and includes:
<P><B>Flare.</B> A flare is a medial or lateral extension to the heel and/or sole of the shoe. Its purpose is to stabilize a hindfoot, midfoot, or forefoot instability. For example, a medial heel flare may be used to support a foot with a valgus deformity.
<P><B>Stabilizer.</B> A stabilizer is an extension added to the side of the shoe, including both the sole and upper, providing more extensive support than a flare. Before a stabilizer is added, the patient must wear the shoe for a few weeks until it is "broken in." Adding a stabilizer to a new shoe can lead to excessive pressure build up, blistering, or serious skin breakdown.
<H2>Extended Steel Shank</H2>
An extended steel shank is a strip of spring steel which is inserted between the layers of the sole, extending from the heel to the toe of the shoe. It is most commonly used in combination with a rocker sole, and will often make the rocker sole more effective. An extended steel shank also can prevent the shoe from bending, limit toe and/or midfoot motion, aid propulsion on toe-off, and strengthen the entire shoe and sole. It is indicated for hallux limitus or rigidus, limited ankle motion, and overweight patients.
<H2>Cushion Heel</H2>
A cushion heel consists of a wedge of shock-absorbing material added at the heel, providing a maximum amount of shock absorption while maintaining a stable stance. Cushion heels may be appropriate following a calcaneal fracture or for calcaneal diabetic ulcers, for example.
<H2>Extensions</H2>
An extension is added to the sole of a shoe to increase its height or thickness. When an extension is added only to the heel area of the sole, its purpose is to accommodate a fixed deformity or to relieve hindfoot pressure. A heel-only extension is useful in accommodating a foot which is fixed in a plantar-flexed position or for Achilles tendinitis. A complete heel and sole extension is used to eliminate a leg length discrepancy. Depending on its height, the extension is generally made of crepe, leather, or rigid foam, and should be used in conjunction with a rocker sole to compensate for the loss of flexibility in the sole when the extension is added. Extensions can be used with a wide variety of shoes, including athletic footwear and dress shoes, and can be covered with matching upper material to achieve cosmetically pleasing results.
<P>External shoe modifications are an important part of prescription footwear, and those included in this article represent only a sample of what is currently available. Practitioners who understand the effects of the available modifications gain the powerful option of implementing a wide-ranging variety of treatment techniques.

<H1>Gait Analysis and Prescription Diabetic Footwear</H1>
<FONT=+4><B>Is there a marriage on the horizon?</B></FONT>
<P><I>by Peter R. Cavanagh, PhD; Jan S. Ulbrecht, MD; Gregory S. Caputo, MD; and David Lemmon, PhD</I>
</CENTER>

<P>As regular readers of this column well know, gait analysis is traditionally the domain of dynamic electromyography, force platforms, and joint kinematics and kinetics. Likewise, readers are also familiar with the problems of the foot in diabetes that are chronicled each month in the Team Diabetic department of <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>. Is there a possible relationship between these two seemingly disparate fields? Perhaps the more appropriate question is: What can gait analysis do to help with the problem of footwear prescription for diabetic patients? 
<P>Certainly gait analysis can be of tremendous benefit as long as the scope of it is extended to embrace some of the more modern methods: such as the role of in-shoe pressure measurement in prescribing shoes for patients with peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes mellitus. The technique of in-shoe pressure measurement is a relatively new addition to the gait analysis toolbox, and diabetic patients are among the most challenging cases for the practitioner. There is obviously the basis here for a great relationship.
<P>Principal among the problems of the diabetic foot is insensitivity to pain due to neuropathy--a condition that affects the feet of approximately 20 percent of patients after 15 years of diabetes. Since these patients can feel no pain in their feet, poor-fitting footwear can injure the foot's dorsal surface. More commonly, skin injury occurs on the plantar surface at sites of high plantar pressure. Any skin injury can mark the start of the path to amputation. As such, the major goals of therapeutic footwear in this setting are to accomplish adequate dorsal fit despite having no useful feedback from the patient, and to provide enough cushioning of the plantar surface to distribute plantar forces to minimize focal pressure. While the traditional methods of gait analysis alluded to above are useful in a number of footwear prescription contexts (such as leg length asymmetry correction or ankle joint immobilization), they do not tell us anything about shoe fit or plantar pressure.
<P>In most clinics the approach to prescribing therapeutic footwear for the patient with insensate feet has not changed very much over the last 50 years. Bluntly stated, it is a trial and error art form, with success critically dependent upon the intuition, experience, and skill of the shoe fabricator. 
<P>Once the shoe is manufactured, rarely is any kind of systematic evaluation employed to assess the probable success of the product. Typically, the process works like this: a clinician (who has a clear idea of the pathology) communicates a need to an orthotist or pedorthist (who has a clear idea of the possibilities for intervention) and a product is produced. The therapeutic shoe is dispensed to the patient after a "fitting," often with the suggestion to "let me know if this is not right." This would be good advice to patients who have the ability to perceive pain and detect the changes in gait mechanics that footwear modifications can engender. However, those of us who regularly treat diabetic patients with insensate feet know how disastrous the consequences of inappropriate therapeutic shoes can be. In this case, the implications of a shoe "not being right" are that an ulcer will probably develop.
<P>A number of practitioners are beginning to realize, however, that plantar pressure measurement offers a way to help the clinician break out of the cycle of trial and error that is so often necessary to find the correct footwear solution to a patient's problem. The instrumentation for one such system we use (the PEDAR from EMED) consists of flexible insoles, which are actually a matrix of approximately 100 small interconnected pressure sensors. During testing, these insoles are worn between the foot and the insole of the shoe. Thin leads connect the insoles to a data collection unit on the patient's waist. A small laptop computer reads the data from this unit and plots a color-coded display of the pressure between the foot and the shoe (figure 1). The peak pressures and impulses from any region can be identified and printed out for evaluation. 
<P>Exploiting the power of this technique requires that measurements be taken before and after shoe modifications are performed. Ideally, any shoe deemed suitable for an insensate patient would reduce the pressure at all areas to below a level that could cause tissue breakdown. Unfortunately, such a threshold value for pressure remains elusive; therefore, we usually strive to reduce pressure at critical locations in the foot so that they are well below those measured in a shoe which we know has not been satisfactory. 
<P>A recent example from our clinic illustrates this approach. A 60-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus and loss of protective sensation presented with an ulcer on the plantar aspect of her left foot, which was shortened due to a trans-metatarsal amputation. After healing the ulcer we prescribed a custom, short rigid rocker shoe with a custom molded insole. Three weeks later she was back in the clinic with a new ulcer at the site of the previous lesion. This time, however, after healing the ulcer we performed a gait analysis that included in-shoe pressure measurement and foot placement analysis. The analysis illustrated that the patient consistently walked with a 15 degree toe-out on the left side (so that she could not use the rocker) and that plantar pressures at the ulcer site were in excess of 600 kPa--about what might be expected during barefoot walking.
<P>The new shoe was made with the rocker axis oriented obliquely to accommodate her toe-out, and a deep PPT "plug" was inserted into the midsole of the shoe beneath the prior ulcer site. Repeat plantar pressure measurement when the second pair of shoes was dispensed indicated that plantar pressure had now been reduced by 40 percent. If there had been no significant reduction in plantar pressure, we would have kept the patient in a protective device and gone back to the drawing board until a shoe finally did reduce the pressure. Five months have passed and the patient is still healed and living an active life. She thanks her shoes but we know that gait analysis had a lot to do with the outcome's success.
<P>While we have emphasized the role that measurement can play after the shoe has been designed, there is clearly much to be done in improving the design process itself. While this does not directly involve gait analysis, it is worth noting that computer modeling of the foot-shoe interface may eventually be able to eliminate much of the gait analysis that we presently advocate. 
<P>Finite element modeling is an engineering technique that represents complex problems by simple geometrical elements. The equations for each element are assembled and then the whole problem is solved simultaneously by the computer. The beauty of this approach is that different shoe modifications can be specified on the keyboard--and the effects of the modifications on the foot can be predicted. We have learned, for example, that by adding a 1/2-inch urethane foam insole, the peak plantar pressure beneath the second metatarsal head can be reduced 28 percent for a normal foot. When the insole is placed beneath a foot with reduced sub-metatarsal head soft tissue, pressure is reduced by 42 percent. Also, as insole thickness increases, the incremental reduction of peak pressure tapers off, indicating that there is a point where "more" would not necessarily be "better." While it would obviously be possible to build models of individual feet (using medical imaging techniques such as MRI to give the structural parameters), it is likely that a more powerful use of modeling will be to define some general rules for therapeutic shoe manufacture that will be applicable to broad groups of patients. At present, such guidance based on quantitative information does not exist.
<P>It is worth pointing out that more traditional gait analysis may yet prove useful in dealing with this clinical problem if it is linked with plantar pressure measurement. We need to first understand in the research setting how different kinetic and kinematic factors affect in-shoe plantar pressure. Armed with that knowledge, we may wish to teach our patients to walk differently.
<P>The time has come for the measurement tools offered by gait analysis to be embraced by the community of clinicians who prescribe, design, and dispense therapeutic footwear. Gait analysis of patients walking in newly prescribed shoes must mean more than simply watching the patient walk. In the case of the insensate foot, where pressure reduction is usually the goal, direct measurement of the pressure between the foot and shoe should be considered a vital part of the process. If any new shoe has not substantially reduced plantar pressure compared to a previously worn shoe in which the patient experienced tissue breakdown, it should be discarded and a new device designed. And it won't be long before design information will be available from computer models. Perhaps the pedorthist of the 21st century will spend as much time at the computer terminal as he or she currently spends at the bench.

<H1>Down the Road in Orthotic Automation</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Having tracked the journey of the automated orthoses field for the past eight years, I have a sense of where it is headed and how the biomechanics mainstream will be affected. Here are my personal predictions for the remainder of the century:
<P><B>1.</B> Most practitioners will lose their fear or uncertainty of scanning casts and feet. Emerging technologies will replace the time- honored mess of plaster casting and the to-be-missed craftsmanship of manual appliance fabrication. I hope that the technology is met with a healthy dose of skepticism. Technology is easier said than done and the entire computer field is wracked by overstatement and hype. <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> will be there to sort through the chips and drives.
<P><B>2.</B> There will be a leapfrogging of office-based and lab-based automation as offices are driven to keep up with labs and, in turn, labs are driven to keep up with the proliferation of office-based automation. Practitioners and labs must be very conscious of this and adopt open technologies that can evolve and protect legacy investments. This takes a lot of clear thinking about where the field is going to be three years from now. Expect all systems to become obsolete within three years max.
<P><B>3.</B> Most labs worth their glue will have a cast scanning capability that works either with their own miller or a downstream miller. The smaller the lab, the faster it will adopt this technology. Virtually all labs will install scanners to store cast data, even if they don't use automation to fabricate the orthoses. These digital libraries may eventually merge into massive casting databanks. Certainly they will create new insights into research of foot health.
<P><B>4.</B> Labs will create relay stations throughout the United States and around the globe. These cheap and collapsible relay stations will follow the market. A major lab in the Midwest could open a relay station in the back of a storefront in Florida where orthoses could be scanned and modemed to the central fabrication point. The same approach will be taken globally as scanners are installed anywhere on the planet for modeming back to American labs. Such installations already exist in Israel, Hong Kong, Northern Ireland, and England to name a few. Conversely, foreign labs may set up their own relay stations here. Israeli and Australian labs already are setting up shop in the United States. All of these factors will dramatically and repeatedly change the economic dynamics of the custom foot orthosis industry. Many new names will appear and old ones will fade. Practitioners will have to constantly keep abreast of changes in their chosen labs to comprehend the quality of the device their patient will be receiving.
<P><B>5.</B> CAD-CAM milling may become an expensive specialty that labs will no longer be able to indulge in. Central or shared fabrication may become a new reality in the field, just as printing is today. That will only add another consideration to burden the practitioner who will have to understand that his casts are being measured, interpreted, and then milled--quite possibly at three different sites by three different organizations.
<P><B>6.</B> Offices will soon flock to foot scanners and digitizers as they become cheaper and more reliable. You snooze, you lose will be the rule. The public will find data casting much more appealing than plaster goo, and the ease of operation and cost effectiveness will be a mandamus in the managed care environment. Many of these offices will attempt to capture the milling in their own office as an economic advantage. Many of them will be burned big time. A few practitioners will get together and share a miller. Fewer of them will get burned. Some may even thrive. On the other hand, some practitioners may wisely scan the foot, manipulate the data, and simply use a commercial milling source the same way they send blood work out.
<P><B>7.</B> Scanner-ready labs will have a market advantage. Scanner-ready offices will have a practice advantage. Eventually, scanners will be simple peripherals that plug into the serial port of the average Pentium computer. There may even come a point when scanning software is sold separately from hardware. The most advanced offices will marry their scanning information to many other facets of practice, including patient education, billing, and diagnosis.
<P><B>8.</B> Orthoses in the mall, in the shoe store, in the ski shop, and every other place are here and this need not be a bad thing if the biomechanics mainstream hops on right now and captures this important opportunity. But in this case the public loses too. Unless practitioners get organically connected to this process as advisors and even overseers, expect shoe salesmen, jewelry clerks, health club assistants, and even shoe shine attendants to assess and dispense foot orthoses. That would be a giant step backward.
<P>That's how technology is. Three steps forward, one big step back. Every advance gives rise to a whole new set of problems that the next advance remedies. But technology can serve the biomechanics field only if it is understood and controlled by the specialists. Those of you who do not falter in comprehending laser and endoscopic surgery should not be befuddled by the advances in store for automated foot orthoses. But remember, technology starves without a market and thrives with a market. You are the market. You control the big red switch.

<H1>The Mechanics of Foot Orthoses for Runners</H1>
<P>by Joe Hamill, PhD, and Timothy R. Derrick</B>
</CENTER>
<P>A question often asked in the treatment of runners is why a device should be applied to the foot if the most frequent injuries are superior to the foot. The answer requires an understanding of lower extremity mechanics during running--particularly during the support phase. With each step, runners experience a force that can be up to three times their body weight at foot contact. This force must be attenuated by the runner so that there is no damage to the system. Approximately 25 percent of this force is transmitted up to the level of the head during each step, illustrating that the body cannot attenuate all of the applied force.
<P>Runners attempt to reduce these forces in several ways: first, by wearing cushioned running shoes and, secondly, by running on a soft surface. The body also uses several anatomical actions of the lower extremity to attenuate the impact force. The primary actions are flexion of the knee and pronation of the subtalar joint. The knee flexion action during running is relatively stable over a wide range of running situations. However, while a certain amount of pronation is necessary, in certain situations excessive motion of the subtalar joint can lead to injury.
<P>Excessive motion of the subtalar joint has been related to a number of running injuries, including those most often cited in injury surveys. The purpose of an orthosis is to control the amount of subtalar joint pronation during running. In very basic terms, it is able to achieve this function since it is posted medially, preventing the foot from rolling medially during the pronation action. Similarly, a medially posted forefoot orthosis will prevent forefoot pronation. 
<P>The source of excessive motion of the rearfoot that results in the use of an orthosis has been an area of study for many biomechanists. Clearly, factors such as running shoes with very soft midsoles and accomodative surfaces can induce greater pronation than is normal for an individual. In our experience, the primary source of excessive rearfoot pronation results from anatomical structural abnormalities. These abnormalities range from a forefoot varus foot to an equinus foot. However, the severity of the structural abnormality will not simply determine the likelihood of incidence or injury. For patients with a structural abnormality, there are other risk factors that, in addition to the abnormality, will cause injury and therefore require orthotic treatment. These risk factors include exercise patterns, prior history of injury, genetic predisposition, gait patterns, and footwear.
<P>Orthoses clearly are not a cure for running injuries but, after rest, they are probably the most often prescribed mode of treatment. Logically, therefore, we should have a clear body of evidence to support the notion that orthoses actually work. Unfortunately, we don't. For many athletes, orthoses have proven to be a relief; for others, they have done nothing to relieve injury. However, in a quality assurance project conducted at the University of Massachusetts in 1987, orthoses were reported to be an effective treatment. A prior clinical study at the University of Oregon reported that 78 percent of runners prescribed orthoses were able to return to pain-free running.
<P>Research studies on the effect of orthoses on rearfoot motion have not shown dramatic changes in rearfoot pronation with othoses. A study in 1979 reported a nonsignificant reduction of 4 degrees in rearfoot angle with and without orthoses during running. At Pennsylvania State University, researchers inserted layers of felt pad to simulate orthoses in the shoes of runners and reported quite large changes in rearfoot angle. Other studies have shown slight reductions in rearfoot angle during running with the application of orthoses.
<P>Biomechanists have postulated that the mechanism of injury to the knee in runners lies in the kinematic relationship between the actions of the subtalar joint and the knee joint. During the first half of the support phase, pronation at the subtalar joint, internal tibial rotation, and knee flexion occur. During the latter half of support, the opposite actions take place: supination, external tibial rotation, and knee extension. It has been suggested that if maximum pronation occurs at a point in time that is different from maximum knee flexion, then the internal/external rotation of the tibia would be disrupted. This would result in abnormal knee kinematics. The mechanism was tested using a tri-planar electrogoniometer in subjects who ran with and without orthoses. Although a significant reduction in pronation when wearing the orthoses took place, there were no differences in internal knee rotation or in the changes in timing of pronation and knee flexion.
<P>In 1985, another study was conducted also using a tri-planar electrogoniometer to study orthoses. These researchers reported similar results to those found in an earlier study. However, they also reported that maximum knee valgus was significantly greater in the orthotic condition. Researchers speculated that the increase in knee valgus occurred to compensate for the decrease in pronation with the orthosis. They hypothesized that a transfer of frontal plane motion from the ankle proximally to the knee had taken place.
<P>If the purpose of an orthosis is to reduce rearfoot pronation, then certain types of running shoes also must be considered orthoses. A number of studies have shown that firm midsole running shoes reduce rearfoot pronation angles. Generally, it is thought that firm midsole shoes act like an orthosis because they prevent the individual from pronating too much. On the other hand, a soft midsole shoe can accentuate rearfoot motion.
<P>In a more recent project, researchers conducted a 3-D high speed video study on the combined effects of orthoses and shoe midsole hardness. Subjects who regularly wore prescription orthoses ran with and without their orthoses in two pairs of running shoes. The shoes were identical except for midsole hardness. Results indicated that the orthoses reduced rearfoot pronation, but more so in the hard midsole shoe than in the soft midsole shoe. There were no differences in internal/external rotation of the tibia nor were there any differences in the timing of the critical events. However, one interesting finding involved femoral rotation. With the orthoses and the hard midsole shoe, the femur was in a more externally rotated position throughout the support period. Researchers suggested that the shift in external rotation of the femur may reduce stress at the knee joint by reducing the forces that tend to make the patella track abnormally.
<P>Based on anecdotal and clinical evidence, it is clear that prescription orthoses do in fact help the majority of injured runners return to their regular training schedule. However, it should be noted that a number of risk factors may contribute to the injury. The prescription of orthoses takes care of the outcome of these other risk factors and should not be considered a cure.
<P>Although research evidence for the effectiveness of orthoses is not unequivocal, this should in no way prevent their use. There are two possible explanations as to why the research literature is contradictory. First, it is possible that the biomechanical techniques by which the orthoses are evaluated are not precise enough to detect the interaction of foot and orthosis. Secondly, their interaction may be much more subtle than expected and thus not quantifiable using present techniques.

<FONT=+4><B><I>The success of any treatment involving foot orthoses is wholly dependent upon intelligently selecting from the available spectrum of orthotic materials and then using them wisely to construct the correct device.</I></B></FONT>

<P><I>by Jim Willis and Edwin Black</I>
</CENTER>

<P>A foot orthosis can be a highly effective cornerstone of treatment, or it can hamper proper outcomes. The key is selecting the proper orthotic materials and designing them into the right device. One of the easiest pitfalls to fall into is pigeonholing materials as rigid or accommodative or flexible. Those are convenient tags, and indeed we will even use them in this article. But the word "rigid" is in fact a nebulous term when talking about orthopedic appliances. Every material has a certain degree of elasticity. Even concrete is not 100 percent rigid; it will deform to a certain degree when subjected to any stress.  Indeed, architects have experimented with "woven concrete" for years.
<P>When we look at any orthosis, the material used will bend a certain amount whenever a certain degree of force is applied. Thus the words rigid or flexible have no real meaning. In fact, all orthotic materials have a certain degree of flexibility and a certain degree of rigidity.
<P>The flexibility of any orthotic material is a function not only of its molecular makeup, but of a number of other factors. One dominant factor is of course the thickness of the material. Since the flexibility of the material is inversely proportional to the cube of the cross-sectional area, for example, the flexibility of polypropylene can be equated to the flexibility of Rohadur, if the polypropylene is made thick enough or the Rohadur is made thin enough. Another leading factor is the weight and build of the patient. A half-inch thickness will support rigidly a slender 110-lb. woman, but bend under the load of a 300-lb. obese man.
<P>A thorough understanding of the entire spectrum of orthotic materials will enable the practitioner to combine them to the best advantage of the patient. The following list is hardly inclusive, but does provide a map of the leading materials. Once again, we do use some of the handy labels, but when deploying these materials, remember that their most common use may not be the best use for your patient.
<P><B>Cork.</B> This filler material has the ability to make a flexible orthosis more rigid while still providing shock absorbing characteristics. 
<P><B>EVA.</B> This economical polyolefin co-polymer is more properly referred to as ethylene vinyl acetate. It is available in a wide variety of densities, and is most often chosen for its light weight. 
<P><B>Graphite Composite.</B> Known for their rigidity, these materials are frequently used as an orthotic module or shell.
<P><B>High-density polyethylene.</B> This polyolefin plastic material is commonly used in geriatric and sports applications.
<P><B>Leather.</B> Often used as a flexible shell, leather can also be laminated in layers to create a more rigid device. The layered incarnation is commonly referred to as Leather Laminate.
<P><B>Neoprene.</B> The closed-cell variety of this material is durable and  shock absorbent, making it suitable for use as a padding material for orthoses. 
<P><B>Open cell polyurethane foam.</B> This material's shock absorbing properties make it a good choice for use as a filler in a functional orthosis. It is also able to withstand repeated shock and heavy weight, and resists bottoming out.
<P><B>Plastazote.</B> This soft material molds to the foot as the patient wears it. Its light weight makes it a good choice for filler and posting material. Plastazote is also useful for reducing pressure because it deforms under weight and disperses that weight over a greater surface area.
<P><B>Polydor.</B> Poly methyl methacrylate was designed to replace Rohadur. As another popular acrylic, it comes close in matching Rohadur's rigidity.
<P><B>Polypropylene.</B> A polyolefin plastic material commonly used in sports applications. Polypropylene is generally considered a semi-rigid material. However it can function as a rigid material when used in greater thicknesses in the construction of orthoses for lighter patients. "Polypro," as it is nicknamed, is the  most common CAD/CAM-milled device.
<P><B>Poron.</B> An open cell polyurethane foam used as a soft tissue supplement.
<P><B>RCH500.</B> A polyethylene, more commonly known as subortholen and JMS500, RCH500 is one of the more flexible materials commonly used in shell construction. It has the notable characteristic of not shrinking when exposed to heat, making it easier to size the material prior to molding the orthosis.
<P><B>TPE.</B> Thermoplastic elastomer is a combination of rubber and polypropylene. It is more flexible than polypropylene or co-polymer, but more rigid than polyethylene.
<P><B>Viscoelastic polymer.</B> These shock absorbent materials have the ability to function as a liquid with memory, offering effective shock absorbency and resisting bottoming out. The viscoelastic material, silicone, has advantages over other viscoelastics in that it significantly reduces sheer forces.
<P><B>Zytel.</B> Depending on the thickness chosen, this nylon material can be used for the construction of semi-rigid to semi-flexible orthoses.

<H1>Lower Limb Length Discrepancies</H1>
<BR><FONT=+4><B><I>Effective treatment of limb length 
discrepancies can include full-length lifts, orthoses--or a combination of both--and surgery in severe cases.</I></B></FONT>
<P><I>by Guido La Porta, DPM</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Clinicians treating lower extremity musculoskeletal pathology must be on the lookout for limb length inequality. Limb length inequality is, in my experience, the most consistent finding during examination for lower extremity musculoskeletal complaints. Patients who present with unilateral signs and symptoms such as hyperpronation, halux valgus, metatarsalgia, Achilles tendinitis, and knee pain are prime candidates for length inequality as a primary or contributing etiology. 
<P>Limb length discrepancies of greater than 2cm frequently come to the attention of practitioners when patients present with compensatory gait and spinal deformities. While the incidence of limb length asymmetry in the general population is currently unknown, patients presenting with less than 2cm discrepancies probably are much more common than those presenting with greater than 2cm discrepancies.
<H2>Categories and Compensations</H2>
Limb length discrepancy is subdivided into structural and functional categories. A structural asymmetry is an actual shortening of the skeletal system between the head of the femur and the ankle joint mortise. Functional discrepancy is secondary to abnormal or altered lower extremity mechanics. A third category of environmental discrepancy, secondary to either poor footwear or training maneuvers, also has been suggested. Regardless of the etiology, limb length asymmetry usually manifests itself as lower extremity injury or low back pain. A decision to treat asymmetry less than two centimeters should be based on symptoms, activity level, or degree of compensation.
<P>The body compensates for limb length asymmetry with three classic positions. Type I compensation presents with lumbar and cervical scoliosis; the pelvis tilts downward on the short side and the head and shoulder tilt downward on the long side. The long side demonstrates hyperpronation and increased arm swing. Type 2 compensation presents with lumbar scoliosis; the pelvis tilts downward on the short side and the head and shoulder are level. Type 3 compensation presents with no sound column compensation. The head and shoulder tilt toward the shorter side. Type 1 compensation is more common in adults while Type 3 is more common in children.
<H2>Measurement</H2>
Clinical measurements of limb length discrepancy are accomplished by either the direct or indirect method. The direct method involves measuring the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the medial malleous. Variations of the direct method include using the lateral mallelous, umbilicus, or xiphoid process. The direct technique, however, can be inaccurate due to joint contracture, pelvic obliquity, and difficulty in finding landmarks. As such, the indirect method is often preferable. This method involves palpation of the iliac crests while the patient is weightbearing. The anterior and posterior superior iliac spines should be measured to obtain consistent values. Although pelvic height differences may influence this measurement, palpation of the top of the greater trochanter should alert the clinician to this possibility. By using different landmarks, the clinician should be able to differentiate between leg length inequality, pelvic rotation, and pelvic height differences.
<P>A more accurate measurement can be obtained using radiographs or computed tomography. These tests, however, require proper positioning and involve some expense. Although clinical measurement maybe more feasible, the more accurate diagnostic tools are necessary when surgical intervention is planned.
<H2>Treatment</H2>
Structural inequalities up to 10 mm may be treated with lifts within the shoe. Full-length lifts (as opposed to heel lifts) are recommended as heel lifts may produce secondary pathology such as stress concentration and Achilles tendon shortening. Length inequalities greater than 10 mm may require a combination of in-shoe lifts and modification to other portions of the shoe. A thorough musculoskeletal evaluation is required as there is sure to be muscle imbalance in long-standing deformity. Lifts should be instituted in stages to allow mechanical changes to occur gradually.
<P>Functional inequalities--especially those caused by hyperpronation--may be treated with functional orthoses. Although prefab devices are very useful, certain pathology involving Tibules Posterior dysfunction or knee pain may require custom-made devices. Symptoms primarily related to poor shock absorption may be effectively treated by soft tissue supplements such as Plastazote.
<P>Larger inequalities that do not respond to mechanical therapy, and are functional and/or cosmetic concerns, may require surgical intervention. Surgical intervention may involve the use of immaculate distraction with internal fixation or gradual distraction with external fixation. Larger inequalities are more amenable to gradual distraction techniques and may also involve simultaneous lengthening of the shorter extremity and shortening of the longer extremity. The tibia is more frequently lengthened than the femur. 
<P>The current interest in limb length discrepancy has been fueled in part by the introduction of the Ilizarov method of gradual distraction to augment standard surgical techniques. The Ilizarov principle of gradual distraction is not fixator specific. While lengthening without associated deformities may respond well to simple linear fixators, complex multiplanar deformities are best handled by Ilizarov frames which allow correction in all three body planes simultaneously.
<P>The clinician who treats lower extremity musculoskeletal pathology must have a high index of suspension for leg length inequality. This entity is very common and may present as a structure of functional pathology. Inequalities as seemingly insignificant as 3mm may have a profound impact on the active athletic population. Effective treatment may be provided by the use of full length lifts, orthoses, or a combination of both. Surgical intervention is reserved for severe cases and may involve either immaculate or gradual distraction.

<H1>The Future of CAD/CAM in O&#38;P</H1>
<P><I>by Lawrence R. Lange, CPO, and Tracy C. Slemker, CPO</I>
</CENTER>

<P>When it first appeared, CAD/CAM for the O&#38;P field (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing) seemed like something out of a science fiction novel. People generally shook their heads and said it would never work in the real world. In the 1980s, when the technology was first applied to the production of orthoses and prostheses, a CAD/CAM-produced prosthesis was considered a success if research patients could wear the limb for just a few minutes without experiencing discomfort. 
<P>CAD/CAM was developed almost simultaneously in Canada and Great Britain by researchers from the University of Vancouver and the University College of London. When the technology was still in its infancy, producing a CAD/CAM prosthesis was a clumsy procedure. First the computer required an image of the residual limb. This involved digitizing the residual limb through one of three methods: a contact or non-contact digitizer, inputting measurements into the software, or selecting a match from a "library" of shapes stored in the system's memory. This shape was then rectified on the computer through the manipulation of regions on the model or by the selection of a template from the system's memory. 
<P>The variety of templates was limited, as were the shapes in the library. The software hindered the spontaneity of individualized modifications performed by a trained hand. At the time, a good prosthetist was thought to be far more capable than a computer when it came to producing a rectified positive model. 
<H2>The Present State of CAD/CAM</H2>
Currently seven companies supply CAD/CAM products to the orthotic and prosthetic field. There are also suppliers of software packages, hardware packages, individual items such as digitizers and imagers, and combinations of all of the above. The marketplace is competitive, however, because there are only approximately 2,500 certified practitioners in the Untied States. The competition is augmented by the fact that approximately 50 percent of the facilities in the United States are of the small facility/individual ownership type.
<P>Current sales of CAD/CAM suites number approximately 40 per year. Roughly 200 to 250 suites in the United States are now in use. At a cost of between $50,000 to $130,000 for a complete suite, few facilities are capable of justifying this kind of investment. So many of the suppliers have started to offer their systems for sale without a carver or milling device. By eliminating the carver or milling device, facilities can now purchase CAD/CAM capability for approximately $20,000 to $40,000. With the use of a phone line and a modem, practitioners can transmit model shapes to a central fabrication lab and have sockets delivered to their door overnight. Some suppliers even lease their software at a reasonable price.
<P>Since most offices have IBM-based computer systems--and even the most sophisticated CPUs are reasonably priced--individual owners of small facilities now have the opportunity to get involved with the future of the orthotic and prosthetic field. This also has created opportunities for central fabrication businesses and chains of offices, which all modem information to a central location. It is now practical for a single office to set up a milling facility to serve several satellite offices. A recent survey found that 53 percent of facilities using CAD/CAM use a central office for milling and 55 percent of the satellites maintain their own CAD capability.
<P>While data entry techniques have remained the same, data now can be manipulated easier. Modifications to the model, both before and after application of a template, can be carried out to minute degrees. Images on the screen can be bent to correct deformities (i.e., a valgum deformity can be corrected at the knee on the screen by manipulating the image). CAD/CAM suites can be tailored directly to the practice of a given facility. For example, both software and hardware are available to practitioners who see a great number of patients wearing spinal orthoses. Imagers and carvers are also available for practitioners who may fabricate a large number of foot orthoses. This, coupled with better control of shapes for below the knee and above the knee amputees, make current CAD/CAM systems both extremely practical and very reliable. 
<H2>The Future of CAD/CAM in Orthotics and Prosthetics</H2>
Currently, research is underway to answer questions that have spelled the difference between the successful fit and function of a device, and complete failure. Prosthetists and orthotists appreciate the fact that all patients are different. Perhaps what we need is more information about our patients. This is where feature enrichment comes into play. 
<P>By having more information about tissue properties such as stress tolerance, flow properties of different tissues, and even tissue metabolism, perhaps we can change the way we fit our patients. This could be achieved by establishing a feedback loop between the socket diagnostic stage and the socket design stage. The development of thin, flexible pressure transducers has made it possible to obtain some of this data. Together with artificial intelligence properties in the software, we could create a machine capable of learning from and correcting mistakes in the fitting of a prosthesis. The computer might even be able to assist the prosthetist in selecting socket materials that would best be suited for the patient based on the information from the fitting. This would yield a more predictable outcome for fittings and a more comfortable and functional amputee.
<P>Products under development in the field of CAD/CAM include scanners capable of differentiating between types of tissues and the ability to map them accurately within the proposed socket or orthosis. Ultrasound also is being explored as the most reasonably priced device capable of performing this task. Currently, a great deal of effort is being exerted to overcome the hurdle of accuracy. In addition, optical imagers are being developed that could be capable of scanning the entire lower limb, including the plantar and dorsal surface of the foot under weight bearing. This is a barrier in the attempt to develop a system capable of fabricating ankle foot orthoses. Carvers capable of producing enhanced models utilizing data from these images also are being developed. Currently, however, carving or milling systems are not practical because of their cost. On the other hand, cost effective foot orthosis systems have been developed outside of O&#38;P and practitioners should learn more about these.
<P>Rapid prototyping is another future development. This would allow the prosthetist/orthotist to fabricate directly a socket or orthosis from the image on the screen. There are four basic types of rapid prototyping, but stereo lithography and fused deposit modeling are the ones that hold the most promise. These systems currently are priced far out of the marketplace's reach, but they may approach a more reasonable cost once the technology advances and is capable of being mass produced. These devices are also still somewhat slow, despite being referred to as "rapid." Their benefit would be the elimination of the model-production step in fabrication and the ability to go directly to the socket or orthosis.
<P>These changes in CAD/CAM will also effect changes in the fields of prosthetics and orthotics. They will establish reproducible standards of care that will be unobtainable through other methods. Prosthetists and orthotists will become more scientific in their approach toward patient care and will become better diagnosticians. Enhanced patient care will be the outcome of this evolution.

<P>The latest advancements in prosthetic socket design, prosthetic knee joints, or prosthetic feet are always hot topics. Just as important are the other lesser known components that have made possible or enhance the use of these cutting edge developments in prostheses today.
<P>There are now prosthetic sockets from different hand casting methods or assisted casting methods using forms or CAD (Computer Aided Design). Some are conventional quadrilateral designs for the transfemoral amputee, but you are more likely to find an ischial containment design. There has been a major increase in the number of prosthetic knee types, from multiple axis versions of the weight-activated stance phase control to intelligent prostheses using microprocessors. The variety of prosthetic feet now available (most with some type of dynamic response feature) is extensive, and we are just beginning to hear about what could be on the horizon for prosthetic management--osseo-integrated prostheses--that is, the direct attachment of the prosthesis to the amputated bone.
<P>Once all of the discussions are through regarding which socket design or attachment is best, which knee is most cost effective and functional for the individual's needs, and which foot will be the most effective for gait and lifestyle, the design process begins to structure these independent components into a functioning and safe prosthesis. Up until the early 1970s this process essentially consisted of gluing together and laminating the wooden parts of the prosthesis. Since then, a steady movement toward a more modular-type prosthesis has taken place. The current standard is an endoskeletal prosthesis made of assembled metal or carbon fiber components concealed by a soft cosmetic covering. Unfortunately, the component parts that make possible the attachment of all these independent systems into a prosthesis are sometimes overlooked, relegating decisions to a technician or central fabricator.
<P>For many years the Otto Bock company based in Germany held the exclusive patent to the pyramid and ball attachment system that was the foundation to an endoskeletal modular system prosthesis. Over the years, other manufacturers have adapted their components, thus offering the prosthetist the ability to hybridize the Bock endoskeletal modular system to include several manufacturers' components.
<P>Shortly after the introduction of the basic endoskeletal system, adaptors that complemented the modular system were developed and marketed. One such component was a rotatable socket adaptor to allow for internal and external rotation of the knee axis without having to cut apart and realign the prosthetic socket to the socket attachment block. This saved the prosthetist considerable time and labor and allowed for more finite adjustments of the internal and external axis of the knee joint to control any type of medial or lateral whip.
<P>A direct-attachment lamination fixture was developed to accommodate prosthetic sockets for long residual limb amputations, allowing amputees who had not previously been candidates for a modular type endoskeletal prosthesis to now be fitted with this new type of artificial limb. The torsion unit also was added to the prosthetists' armamentarium to absorb the rotary shear forces of gait. This part was designed to replace the shin portion of the modular endoskeletal system. 
<P>These first special adaptors complemented the modular system prostheses and gave them more versatility, resulting in a prosthesis that was very functional, realignable, serviceable, and one that met the majority of needs of the prosthetist and amputee. Some of these parts were very simple in concept and made the work of the prosthetists and technicians much easier. For example, plastic connection caps to which foam cosmetic covers are affixed allow ease of serviceability or alignment changes. Without these time-saving devices, the prosthetist or technician would carefully have to unglue the foam cover from the socket, a process that might just damage the cover itself.
<P>Cultural and vocational needs also contribute to component design. The locking positional rotation adaptor is one example. This adaptor is placed above the knee joint of an AK prosthesis so the user can rotate the lower section of the prosthesis, allowing amputees to sit on the floor with their legs crossed. This is particularly important for teachers who work with small children, and in eastern cultures where floor-sitting is the norm. This feature also allows the amputee to change shoes without having to remove the prosthesis or, with a more complex knee, to make functional adjustments to the unit to accommodate varying activities. Getting into a car and sitting comfortably also have been cited as benefits of the positional rotation adaptor.
<P>With the advent of the lighter weight modular endoskeletal system, more and more hip disarticulation fittings were successful over the long term. As a result, attention was directed toward making this level of prosthesis more functional for the individual. Tom Haslam, CP, and Mike Wilson, CPO, designed the Hip Flexion Bias System. This system was incorporated onto the Bock Free Motion Modular Hip Joint and made possible a prosthesis with active hip flexion motion. When weightbearing on the prosthesis, the amputee would load a large coil spring located on the pylon tube of the hip joint. When weight was removed from the prosthetic side during gait, the spring coil would release its energy. This energy release moves the hip joint of the prosthesis forward, giving the amputee an active hip flexion versus the passive hip flexion through pelvic tilt.
<P>Manual Garcia, CP, used his resourcefulness and engineered an assembly that was a first in a hydraulically controlled knee joint for an endoskeletal system. This concept was never mass-produced, but it was pointed in the right direction.
<P>Although the modular prosthesis has a built-in realignable system, American prosthetists traditionally have been trained to align a prosthesis using the principles taught by Professor Charles Radcliffe and using the Berkeley Adjustable Leg. To that end, an adaptor was designed to allow use of the Berkeley Adjustable Leg in combination with any one of the foot adaptors of the modular system feet, SACH, Single Axis, and Mulit-Axis.
<P>Following the introduction of a three-pronged lamination adaptor that permitted the fitting of longer levels of transfermoral amputations, an innovative prosthetist, Dan Shamp, CP, designed the Shamp Extend-A-Tube. Coupled with the three-pronged adaptor, the Extend-A-Tube permitted changes in alignment and length without having to go through the labor- and time-intensive process of relamination. 
<P>A similar idea was later conceived by Timothy Staats, CP, PhD, then with the United States Manufacturing Company of Pasadena, California. A range of  pylons in varying lengths with four adjustment screws for the pyramid on each end permitted the prosthetist to exchange complete pylon tubes to obtain the proper length,  and they allowed for an additional few degrees of angular adjustment. This became known as the Staats adaptor.
<P>A unique feature of the USMC pylon system, while not a separate component, is the memory grid. On the ball section of the pyramid, ball assembly grid lines have been etched allowing the prosthetist to record in the patient's file the angular settings of the joining parts.
<P>Durr-Fillauer Orthopedic of Chattanooga, Tennessee, developed for the modular systems an aluminum A-P &#38;  M-L slide unit with pyramid and attachment plate. With this component, the prosthetist is able to make direct slide adjustments in the two planes. Fillauer also produces a unique component called an Upper Pylon Tube Clamp which allows direct attachment of the pylon to a four-hole pattern base. To further hybridize systems, this company developed a four-hole pattern for attachment of the Flex-Foot.
<P>The first company I know of that produced adaptors to fit the niches unaddressed by the Bock components was MICA Corporation, headed by Milo Collier, CP, of Washington. MICA developed an array of unique designs like the pyramid coupler (a tube clamp adaptor with a pyramid), transition components for joining a 30mm tube to a four-bolt pattern adaptor, adapting a flex foot four to a four-bolt pattern, and the pyramid to pyramid adaptor.
<P>These interlinking components make possible the multifunctional, multinational prostheses we see in use today by amputees around the world. Without these innovative components, such hybridized prostheses would not be possible.

<H1>Prosthetic Feet and Their Selection</H1>
<FONT=+4><B>Once considered obsolete, single and multi-axial feet are making a comeback.</B></FONT> 
<P><I>by Dennis Cole, CP</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Thanks to a number of major design improvements, single and multi-axial feet--some of the oldest prosthetic foot devices, dating back at least a hundred years--are enjoying renewed popularity among prosthetists and their patients. 
<P>The earliest versions of the single axis-foot (dorsiflexion/plantar flexion only) and the multi-axial foot (dorsiflexion/ plantar flexion, inversion/eversion) were fashioned by armorers of knights and village blacksmiths. These prosthetists of the past were quite innovative. Their early and obvious attempts to imitate the missing foot made sense. The feet-of-old favored the human foot and ankle in function and appearance. Many of the feet and ankles they made actually had strips of leather or gut that were intended to simulate the missing musculature. The materials used could easily have been wood, leather, metal or cork.
<P>Then in the late 1940s, the SACH (solid ankle, cushioned heel) foot was developed. Financed by post-World War II government grants as an enhancement to the newly devised below-knee prosthesis known as the "Patty Bear" leg (or "Patellar Tendon Bearing" prosthesis), the SACH foot consisted of a wooden keel surrounded by layers of rubber sheeting. The foot was attached to the shank by a simple nut and bolt. The only  movement came from a soft foam wedge in the heel which compressed at heel strike, and a bending of the toe near the end of the foot prior to toe-off.
<P>The new BK prosthetic socket design led researchers at the time to recommend that the old style of feet--the single-axis and the multi-axis--be considered obsolete in most instances of below-knee fittings, and in many instances of above-knee fittings. The SACH foot was recommended instead. This line of thinking continued for more than 40 years.
<P>Toward the end of the 1980s, various innovators from around the world contributed to the development of new designs of single- and multi-axial feet. These new designs, coupled with a myriad of major improvements in below-knee and above-knee socket design, forced prosthetists to reevaluate their hardened stand regarding the selection and use of prosthetic feet. 
<P>Some of the "cutting edge" ideas in socket design include suction below-knee sockets with no visible means of suspension, and silicone liners that act like an extra layer of fatty tissue to reduce the normal tension on the skin during weightbearing. The above-knee amputee could forsake the once seemingly adequate quadrilateral socket for a CAD-CAM narrow M-L socket or a Computer-Aided Designed prosthesis.
<P>To understand the renewed interest in single- and multi-axial prosthetic feet, a few physiological facts should be mentioned. First, a prosthesis is most stable when the foot is flat to the floor. This means that the SACH foot is stable only at mid-stance. With any prosthesis, from heel strike to mid-stance there is a tremendous amount of leverage on the residual limb, resulting in instability at the knee. This instability is overcome only by many physical therapy sessions to train the amputee in the advanced use of his/her remaining muscles. Axial feet reach foot-flat much sooner, resulting in more security earlier in the walking stage. As a result, patients require less post-fitting therapy and experience fewer socket fitting problems than usually would be experienced by the amputee.
<P>Second, prosthetic wearers have always faced stability issues when ambulating on uneven surfaces such as a stony path or at a right angle to a slope. SACH feet are ineffective in these circumstances; single-axis feet are not much better. Under these circumstances,  multi-axial feet truly excel. All of the ankle motion required to get the foot flat to the ground is available with most multi-axial feet. Some feet and ankles also have rotational qualities, another plus for the patient. This feature absorbs some of the torque present with each step, thus reducing some of the external pressures transmitted to the residual limb. 
<P>For the past six years, in our practice we have fitted most of our patients with multi-axial feet and ankles. The results of this departure from SACH feet have been dramatic. There is less fitting time required by the prosthetists and less gait training needed by the therapists. Moreover,  most of our patients return to an independent life-style in a much shorter period of time. 
<P>When practicing the art and science of prosthetic design and selection, there is no one-device-fits-all solution for your patients. However, based on my clinical experience, I prefer to use multi-axial feet whenever possible.

<H1>Specialty Sock Interfaces for Use with Suction Sockets</H1>
<FONT=+4><B>Advances in specialty sock interfaces are making the benefits of suction interfaces available to an even wider population of amputees.</B></FONT>
<P><I>by Martha Field and Mark Smith, CP</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Since suction interfaces offer greater freedom of movement, increased use of remaining muscles, decreased pistoning, increased comfort resulting from elimination of belts and straps, and better cosmesis, practitioners often turn to these interfaces for their prosthetic-wearing patients. Yet, while suction interfaces may be a dream come true for some, until recently certain circumstances have prevented everyone from taking advantage of these systems. Now, however, advances in specialty sock interfaces are making the benefits of suction interfaces available to a wider population by addressing such concerns as volumetric limb change, ease of donning, controlling rotation, motion restriction, and hygiene. 
<H2>Suction Socket Systems for Trans-Tibial Amputations</H2>
Trans-tibial amputees are just one group benefiting from recent advances and the increased availability in suction socket systems. The ICEROSS (Icelandic Roll-On Suction Socket System), introduced in 1985, for example, can now deliver a functional silicone liner through expanded distribution. The 3-S Suction Socket System, Prefabricated Fillauer Silicone Suspension Liners, and the ALPS Clear Pro have all made substantial contributions to the industry. 
<P>These systems consist of a thin walled, elastically compliant, conically shaped silicone sleeve with a pin projecting from the center of the distal end. The pin engages within a receptacle locking device formed into the distal end of the socket of the prosthesis to suspend the prosthesis on the residuum.
<P>These products are all made of silicone and therefore have a fairly high friction coefficient. Once rolled into the residual limb, their tacky nature resists sliding into the prosthetic socket unless a textile interface is first applied over the silicone liner. Additionally, volumetric changes (usually reductions) in the residual limb typically will occur, necessitating adjustments to the socket fit. These adjustments can be accomplished by adding or subtracting the thickness of a prosthetic sock interface. In some cases, when silicone suspension products are applied to a limb, volumetric reductions have been noted to occur more rapidly than usual. This may be attributed to the elasticity of the silicone sleeve, which can exert compression on the soft tissue of the residuum.
<P>The use of prosthetic socks in combination with suction devices has prompted the need for a hole in the distal end of the sock to accommodate the projecting pin. Cutting a hole in the sock results in premature wear because of the sock's ravelling. Sock manufacturers have devised various methods to secure the hole: the "Hole-In-One," for example, has the hole knitted into the sock; a stitched button-hole is sometimes reinforced and sometimes not; and in some cases, a plastic patch is applied so that a reinforced hole can be stamped out. Socks are available in weights from sheath to 6-ply.
<P>In trans-tibial applications where the silicone suspension sleeve extends proximal to the knee joint, the range of motion of the knee may be restricted to some degree. To minimize ROM obstruction, prosthetic sock interfaces using yarns with Lycra spandex provide stretch in the sock and therefore reduce the binding that can occur with non-elastic socks. The elastic properties found in these socks also can reduce distal migration of the sock in trans-femoral applications since the socks tend to grip the proximal brim of the socket when reflected over.
<H2>Suction Sockets for Trans-Femoral Amputation</H2>
Traditional suction sockets for trans-femoral amputees were first used in the U.S. in the late 1940s. These sockets commonly employ skin-to-socket contact, a "pull-in" approach to donning, and a threaded suction valve to maintain an air seal. Since the suction seal is formed by skin contact with the inner socket wall, socks typically are not used. However, a pull sock is often used to make donning easier.
<P>When full socket suction suspension is employed, some wearers may experience friction or pressure in the proximal socket brim area. Special prosthetic socks--such as an Ischial Containment Thigh Protector or a Suction Socket Sheath--provide cushioning and friction relief to the irritated area. These interfaces, short in length and open-ended, allow positioning around the proximal brim only and do not disrupt the skin-to-sock seal.
<P>Silicone suspension liner products provide an added advantage over the more traditional skin to socket suspension fittings. When donning conventional AK suction socket prostheses, trans-femoral amputees have to use a "pull-in" technique that requires a considerable amount of strength and balance. This is not necessary with silicone suction suspension prostheses, which are relatively easy to put on. Additionally, trans-femoral amputees with significant volumetric gains and reductions are not good candidates for conventional systems, but they can be fit satisfactorily with silicone suction liners.
<H2>Rotation, Ease of Donning, and Skin Protection</H2>
As the use of silicone liners has increased for the trans-femoral amputee, prosthetists have noticed prosthesis rotation problems during ambulation. The DERO--a derotational sock system--was designed to control this rotation by applying friction to areas vertically oriented on the inner and outer surfaces of a socket. When worn between the silicone liner and the plastic socket, the friction areas are designed to grip the surfaces of both liner and socket to prevent rotational and vertical pistoning tendencies. Since friction areas add virtually no thickness to the prosthetic sock and are applied in a standard pattern, different ply thicknesses of DERO socks can be layered over each other to accommodate volumetric changes without creating excess pressure in the socket. Circumferential constrictions also are avoided since the friction areas are vertically oriented with space between each area and because the socks contain Lycra spandex to permit stretching. The distal portion of the DERO sock also incorporates a friction area. The area at this point is circular and serves as a reinforcement for the stud access hole. No special modifications to the socket are required to accommodate the DERO prosthetic sock. This sock also has been used by some trans-tibial amputees. In cases where the residual limb and socket do not have a distinctive shape or identity, the sock has reduced rotational and vertical movement during ambulation.
<P>Another approach to the suction suspension interface--the Hypobaric system--uses prosthetic socks or sheaths to which a 1 and 1/2-inch wide band of silicone rubber has been impregnated around the circumference of the sock at the proximal third of its length. The silicone band forms a suction seal between the skin and the socket. For both trans-femoral and trans-tibial amputees, volumetric changes can be accommodated with the use of four increasingly thick fabrics and seals. Daily washing of the socks makes hygiene easier and more efficient.
<P>After donning the Hypobaric sock directly over the skin of the residuum, the trans-femoral wearer pushes--rather than pulls--the limb into the quadrilateral or ischial containment socket. This easy donning makes the system especially appropriate for sensitive patients, older patients, or those who cannot "pull-in" or tolerate contact with a rigid, plastic socket.
<P>The trans-tibial Hypobaric sock must be used with a Pelite liner that is extensively compressed at the level of the band so that it forms a reliable air seal. Special valves are available for both the trans-femoral and trans-tibial applications.
<P>In some cases, prosthetic interfaces incorporating pressure-relieving gel are worn next to the skin within the silicone suspension socket. Wearers of the Silosheath can experience relief of skin irritations, dermatitis, and pressure-related problems that can occur within silicone suction sockets. Since the viscoelastic gel absorbs shear forces, skin abrasion as a result of vertical movement is reduced. The extra layer of gel distally also may help prevent the possibility of feeling the distal pin in the suspension device.
<P>Many amputees have benefitted greatly from the various suction socket systems currently available. Today, sock interfaces are helping many more amputees overcome the problems that prevented them from taking advantage of these suction socket systems in the past.

<H1>The Biomechanics of Prosthetic Knees</H1>
<FONT=+4><B>Advanced material technology and progressive design techniques within the past decade have produced a wide variety of sophisticated prosthetic knee mechanisms.</B></FONT>
<P><I>by Jerry Vilminot, CP</I> 
</CENTER>
<P>Prosthetic rehabilitation is a therapeutic program designed to manage the consequences of a paramount disability. It stands in sharp contrast to standard medical care, which focuses primarily on the patient's pathology and assumes that function will return spontaneously. Though normal function is not possible for a person with a catastrophic disability, effective performance and reentry into active society may be achieved if all measures influencing the patient's capacity to function are provided. For those who have suffered amputation of an extremity, the spectrum of function can be especially broad and challenging.
<P>Amputations through the shaft of the femur are referred to as transfemoral. It has been widely observed in these cases that the length of the remaining residual limb, the patient's physical condition, psychological adjustment, and socioeconomic factors all have a direct relationship to the success of the individual's functional recovery. Equally important is the choice of componentry used in designing a mechanical replacement--particularly the knee mechanism, which for above-the-knee amputees presents a special challenge.
<P>A tremendous amount of time and attention has been devoted to the development of mechanical components. Especially within the past decade, advanced material technology and progressive design techniques have produced a wide variety of sophisticated prosthetic knee mechanisms.
<P>Knee joints function like hinges and are activated and controlled by the patient's residual limb. They must flex easily, yet still provide stability during weightbearing. All prosthetic knees provide friction or a clamping effect during the swing phase of the step to control excessive heel rise and reduce terminal impact. This is accomplished by creating resistance to swing about a single or multiple axis. This method of resistance can range from the purely mechanical (constant friction) to hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders, to state-of-the-art microprocessor technology.
<H2>Mechanical Knee Prostheses</H2>
Due to the loss of normal knee and ankle function, the above-knee amputee must rely on hip musculature to accelerate and decelerate the movement of the shank portion of the prosthesis. The patient must be taught to sense and apply the most appropriate amount of force required for smooth knee control during swing phase. If too little force is applied, the knee will not flex sufficiently and the toe of the prosthetic foot may not clear the floor. If too much force is used, however, the patient will experience excessive heel rise and significant terminal impact just prior to heel strike. Once the patient is trained to sense these nuances of applied force, a slow, methodical stride cadence is typically produced. Although many patients can achieve a natural-appearing gait, it will be limited to one speed; any alteration of the gait cadence results in a knee mechanism that will not flex or extend at the same rate as the natural knee. This is because while the walking speed increases, the friction at the knee remains constant, causing the shank of the prosthesis to lag behind and producing a vaulting gait. Obviously, this significantly hampers  patients who desire to be moderately active. There is no way to overcome the mechanical limitations imposed by this component, regardless of the amount of physical therapy applied.
<P>For patients not concerned with the restriction in gait cadence associated with constant friction, this limitation is of little consequence. The geriatric patient, for example, may be primarily concerned with knee stability. When rehabilitating elderly patients, the selection of constant friction (mechanical) knees provides a sufficient variety of choices, which are also generally less expensive than more sophisticated designs.
<P>On the other hand, restraint provided by hydraulic or pneumatic resistance provides a much wider range of cadence without introducing awkward or unnatural motions. As cadence-responsive knee mechanisms, these units can facilitate what appears to be a normal gait by providing complete control of terminal impact and infinite control of knee flexion and heel rise, while producing a generally smooth swing motion of the entire prosthesis.
<H2>Pneumatic Knee Prostheses</H2>
Pneumatic knee mechanisms usually consist of a swing-phase control unit only. They use an air cylinder housed in a frame positioned posterior to the knee axis. Knee flexion moves the piston down onto the cylinder which forces air through a series of internal valves, bringing about the extension and flexion resistance. These functions can be controlled independently by adjusting screws, usually at the top of the cylinder, creating an extension assist that further minimizes the energy expenditure of the patient. Some units incorporate polycentric or multiple axis linkage along with the pneumatic benefits.
<H2>Hydraulic Knee Prostheses</H2>
In my experience, the principles of hydraulic control of flexion and extension closely duplicate the forces that are exerted by the muscles of a natural limb. Recent advanced designs have enhanced this effect even further by incorporating polycentric linkage systems. These designs provide additional benefits, including significant stability over all types of terrain, shortening during swing phase, and improved cosmesis while sitting.
<P>Hydraulic knee mechanisms are very similar to pneumatic systems because they also use a piston rod within a cylinder. The medium exerting the force is different, however--fluids are used rather than air. Encapsulated liquid provides resistance to motion by being forced through a series of ports or orifices. Specifically, knee flexion forces the piston downward into the cylinder, forcing fluid through the channels into the space above the piston, closing the fluid cycle. A similar process takes place in extension, thus making possible control of the entire swing-phase cycle. This programmed flow is initiated at the beginning of the swing phase. The more the patient increases the cadence, the more resistance to hydraulic flow within the cylinder is created. The net effect is a shorter stride length that allows the patient to take more steps per minute. Conversely, the slower the cadence, the less the resistance, and the longer the steps.
<P>One of the more advanced hydraulic systems is a dual function unit that provides stance stability in combination with the swing-phase control. Every improvement in stance-phase control allows the patient to perform a broader spectrum of activities. This dual function feature provides high resistance to knee bending (ability to bear weight on a flexed knee) at heel strike and foot flat. The patient can now walk down stairs or down slopes in a step-over-step, weightbearing manner. Further, if a patient stubs a toe during extension, the high degree of controlled flexion resistance frequently allows balance recovery.
<P>Practitioners should remember that although a patient might have the best fitting prosthesis available, if the componentry is not suitable to that individual's needs, it is altogether possible that the entire system will be rejected. In my experience, no component is universally suitable to every patient. In the final analysis, prosthetists must begin to spend at least as much time and energy on the selection of foot and knee componentry as they do on achieving optimum comfort and function in socket design.

<H1>AK Socket Design</H1>
<FONT=+4><B>Prosthetists have learned to ignore preconceived ideas and start from a clean slate using anatomical structures as their guide.</B></FONT>
<P><I>by John Sabolich, CPO, and Kevin Carroll, RP, IRL</I>
</CENTER>

<P>After a decade of working on above-knee and other lower extremity socket designs, it's clear that most successful designs have come about by simply observing nature. Through direct human observation of both deep and surface anatomy, many hours of study in cadaver labs, and computerized gait and balance analysis, prosthetists have learned to ignore preconceived ideas and start from a clean slate using anatomical structures as our guide. 
<P>One of the results of this new approach is a socket that has advanced and evolved over the years. Today's device has matured from a plug-quad and narrow-ML design to a more logical anatomical design with specific channels and reliefs that match bones, tendons, and major muscles above the knee.
<P>These new designs are not just for the young athletic amputee, but older adults as well. A comfortable, anatomically-constructed socket is just as important to a 70- or 80-year-old patient as it is to a teenager. Not only do the contours that actually reflect the underlying anatomy help with proper transmission of forces through the prosthesis to the ground, but they also enhance comfort. 
<H2>Evolution of Comfort</H2> 
Socket design has progressed from a narrow ML oval shape that did not significantly involve the ischial and ramal bony complex to one that is highly contoured about the bone and muscle, allowing for a more aggressive capture of the pelvic bones and major muscle groups. This bone and muscle approach plays a crucial role in the biomechanical properties of the interface between the patient and the prosthesis. In this respect, the Oklahoma City (OKC) anatomically contour designed channels and compartments have proven critical to the overall design of advanced sockets for the AK. 
<P>Counter pressure in the femoral triangle area provides a posteriorly directed force. When the femoral triangle is too shallow, the ischial ramus bony complex tends to slip out of its compartment, causing rotational instability. Ultimately, a lack of sufficient depth leads to lateral instability, causing the socket to slide into hyper adduction relative to the femur. This yields excessive pressure on the soft and tender medial proximal tissues of the thigh as well as the distal lateral femur. If, however, the femoral triangle is too deep, donning and doffing become difficult as the skin adheres to tight areas causing excessive pressure while standing and walking. The femoral triangle further contributes to rotational stability by preventing internal rotation in the anterior medial quadrant, while also providing a counter-force. This, in turn, protects the adductor groups of muscles from excessive pressure. In this respect, the femoral triangle has been greatly changed in dimensions from the original days of quadrilateral designs, and is much longer, extending to within a few inches of the distal end.
<P>The shape of the ischial-ramal compartment is rather complicated because it houses the compound curves of the ischial tuberosity and the ascending ramus of the ischium. This is not a straight bony complex, but rather one with compound curves and twists. As such, time and experience are required to skillfully form this compartment. Occasionally redness or irritation associated with the height of this compartment may occur. If irritation exists, it is usually due to an incorrectly shaped compartment or an inadequate volume associated with soft fatty tissue. Irritation often occurs at the extreme superior border as excessive tissue protrudes over the edge. 
<P>The medial wall also houses a triangle of pressure that produces a counterforce to other channels in the socket. This channel is bordered by the semimembranous and adductor magnas posteriorly, the gracilis medially, and the longitudinal facia bordering the ramus proximally. This area of overlapped muscles is reminiscent of the fossa by the poplitea fossa in transtibial amputations. 
<P>As the triangular area bulges inward toward the femur, pressure provides several biomechanical advantages. First, it helps to narrow the medial lateral dimension below the ischial level in a strategic section of the medial wall, just next to the adductor channel. In this way, the ML can be reduced without impinging on the adductor channel. Secondly, the location of this triangular section is strategically opposite a narrow longitudinal channel just posterior to the femur. These two channels work together to synergistically reduce the ML dimension with anatomical accuracy rather than simply flattening the two opposing walls commonly seen in narrow ML or so-called ischial containment sockets. 
<P>As the lateral wall narrows, it curves rather than flattens, as is the case in narrow ML and quadrilateral designs. The lateral walls consist of the vertical channel, the femoral channel, and the posterior trochanteric fossa (PTF), which provides relief to the trochanter and part of the channel for the vastus lateralis. The lateral femoral channel is set in adduction, which approximates the adduction angle of the femur. The longer the femur, the more the two approximate one another. 
<P>This femoral channel also flows into the complementary vertical channel. By doing so, it completes the wrap-around feature of the lateral wall helping to post the longitudinal posterior aspect of the femur while stabilizing the bone, particularly during active extension of the partial thigh. This is especially true at heel strike. 
<P>Superiorly and posteriorly, the gluteal compartment houses most of the gluteal musculature. This is possible because the section itself is flexible enough to collapse when seated, yet also able to regain its integrity during standing and ambulation. By containing this massive muscle group, the socket's surface area is increased, allowing for additional weightbearing. 
<P>The transverse channel is yet another major component. It runs along the inferior aspect of the gluteal musculature in a similar fashion to one leaning his buttocks along the edge of a desk to increase vertical support under the gluteal muscle mass and the posterior inferior portions of the ischial tuberosity. This channel also helps reduce the anterior posterior dimension, which decreases the often overlooked instability and wide AP dimension that many narrow ML sockets exhibit. The channel works in conjunction with a modified femoral triangle pressure to stabilize the AP dimension. It also acts to aid suspension by locking the biceps femoris muscles posteriorly, allowing the muscle group room to expand. Aside from aiding suspension, this also causes a gripping sensation. 
<P>Rotational control is a major advantage derived form this anatomically-contoured design. By locking the ischium, tendons, and major muscle groups, the socket grips these structures in the transverse plane, greatly increasing rotational stability. This reduces the socket's tendency to rotate about the femur's longitudinal axis during the walking, stance, and swing phases of the gait cycle, reducing the need for a belt. 
<H2>New Approaches</H2> 
This scientific approach has begun to spill over into other levels of amputation surgery such as hip disarticulations. Likewise, the common sense approach of bone, muscle, tendon, and nerve contours makes great sense at any level. As a result of these developments, amputees have become involved in areas of work and play previously unheard of.
<P>For the first time, a prosthetist can actually predetermine the rotational angle of the socket relative to the line of progression. Moments of force can be manipulated by controlling channel depth, creating equilibrium at a desirable rotational transverse angle. This design affords prosthetists much greater control over the entire process. No longer will they have to rely on chance, adapting to whichever muscles are stronger or weaker. Finding viable scientific principles of force vectors and moments of force lend a much needed scientific basis for a logical approach to socket design, one specifically fabricated to match the various bones and muscle groups, yielding greater stability and comfort.

<H1>Returning to Work with Back and Leg Injuries</H1>
<P><I>by by Steven R. Geiringer, MD</I>
</CENTER>

<P>"We're supposed to work with a partner when we move boxes, but I was working on a rush order and nobody was around to help me," explains the patient. "I could have handled it by myself but just as I was pulling the box off the shelf, my foot slipped off the bottom rung of the step ladder. I've already missed two days of work because of the pain. When can I get back to my job?" Ask any practitioner and they'll tell you they've heard that same question time and time again.
<P>Contrary to what may appear to be common sense, full healing is not a necessary condition for resuming work. Here are some guidelines that can be used when overseeing the rehabilitation of patients with occupational related impairments.
<P>Plant physicians, plant nurses, or industrial clinic physicians typically make the initial decision whether any time off work is necessary. Often, particularly with muscular strains, the appropriate first step is to attempt to return to work (RTW) the next day, after ice is applied several times. Beyond that, a combination of objective physical examination signs and subjective complaints is considered. "Do no harm" is the overriding factor. The harm to be avoided is to the patient himself, as well as to co-workers or those of us who might later use the products being made, inspected, or delivered by the injured worker. If any doubt exists about whether an employee can safely return to usual and customary activity, a few days off is the safest plan.
<P>The specific timing of RTW depends largely on the physical demands of the position as well as numerous other "intangible" factors. A detailed job description, usually generated by the employer or a work site evaluator, helps the practitioner make this decision. One issue is whether the treatment--physical therapy visits for example--can logistically occur during working hours. Some plants do not allow any time away from a shift because it may be impossible to find fill-in workers. Liability concerns are another obstacle for employers, causing them to forestall RTW until no restrictions are warranted. Some employers, such as steel mills or railroad yards, simply cannot generate enough light duty positions to accommodate workers recovering from injuries.
<P>The primary responsibility of practitioners treating work related injuries is to do what is in the best interest of the patient. If safe RTW can be accomplished during treatment, it is clearly in the best interest of the patient (and of the company and society) to ensure this occurs. The converse also holds; a premature RTW harms not only the patient but other concerned parties as well.
<P>Employees rarely are allowed to return to a fully unrestricted job while they are still recovering from musculoskeletal injury. Therefore, the clinician must become skilled in the determination of appropriate physical and/or time restrictions consistent with the employment scenario. This is largely a trial and error process, but it does take on some aspect of objectivity with experience and guidance.
<P><B>Lumbar Injuries:</B> The most prevalent musculoskeletal injuries are lumbar strain and lumbar herniated disc (with or without radiculopathy, i.e. pinched nerve). A lumbar strain is essentially a muscle pull in the low back. There is little chance of early RTW leading to further or permanent impairment, so timing is largely related to symptoms and safety. A physical examination may have demonstrated abnormal mechanics of back motion (sometimes referred to as pelvic asymmetry), and full duty should not be allowed until the mechanics have normalized. This process involves any or all of the following: physical therapy, ice, stretching, and anti-inflammatory medications. Typical guidelines include limitations on: 

<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Repeated bending or stooping from the waist, e.g., no more than 6 to 10 times per hour;</UL>
<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Amount of weight lifted or carried while in the bent or stooped positions. Early on this may be as little as zero to 5 lbs., with reduced limitations as time passes and healing occurs;</UL>
<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Amount of weight lifted or carried even if in the proper biomechanical position, that is with the knees bent and the back straight, from 10 to 25 lbs.; and</UL>
<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Walking long distances, at least early in the course of treatment.</UL>
<P>These restrictions typically are in place from several days to a few weeks. If the patient reports little or no improvement from what was thought to be a strain, it may be time to consider other diagnoses and perhaps diagnostic testing. 
<P>The herniated disc is the next most common lumbar injury. This occurs when the material of the nucleus pulposus (disc) squeezes through a tear in the fibers that normally keep it in place (anulus fibrosus). This is more serious than a strain, and the time frames for recovery and RTW are correspondingly longer. As initial treatment is underway, complete rest from work (although not bed rest) is mandatory, lasting from several weeks up to two months. Again, the physical demands of the particular job will determine this interval in the individual case. Return to any work is delayed until the examination confirms very reduced if not absent irritation around the affected lumbar region as well as no reproduction of leg or thigh pain with the straight leg raise maneuver (some back pain with this is acceptable). If light duty is available, the following may need to be restricted:

<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Bending and stooping with the same considerations as with a lumbar strain;</UL>
<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Lifting and carrying. With a disc injury, lifting while in the bent or stooped positions is to be prohibited until examination signs of disc irritation have disappeared; later, the amounts are restricted as above;</UL>
<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Lifting or carrying while upright, with similar guidelines as above;</UL> 
<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Long distance walking. Some large plants issue parking passes, allowing the employee to park near the entrance;</UL>
<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Climbing a flight or two of stairs to get to and from the job site is acceptable, whereas routine climbing in the course of the shift at work is not. Reasons for prohibiting climbing include the medical condition itself and safety in the case of unprotected heights; and</UL>
<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Any other activity that might lead to aggravation of the underlying disc injury, undue pain to the worker even without progression of the injury, or possible harm because of the operation of dangerous machinery. The time course of recovery from a herniated disc is from two to four months.</UL>
<P>About one quarter to one third of those sustaining a lumbar herniated disc also will have a radiculopathy, or pinched nerve. This simply means that among the pain sensitive structures being pressed by the inflammatory mass around the disc injury, one or more nerve roots are included. The fifth lumbar (L5) and first sacral (S1) are most commonly affected.
<P>Neurologic manifestations of a pinched nerve, beyond the problems from the disc herniation itself, include numbness and weakness with possible clumsiness and loss of balance. Therefore, restrictions against climbing, unprotected heights, and operation of heavy or dangerous machinery are more important in these cases than if there is no nerve damage. The use of foot controls also is forbidden during healing. A ruptured disc with radiculopathy will take from three to six months to fully heal. Light duty RTW usually is not feasible until two months of healing and treatment have elapsed and the signs of irritation around the disc and nerve have diminished or disappeared.
<P><B>Knee Injuries:</B> Typical guidelines on limitations include the 
following:

<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Squatting;</UL>
<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Climbing as an integral part of the job, i.e., climbing may not be done throughout the work day;</UL>
<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Heavy lifting--this is one instance when proper biomechanical lifting, that is with the knees bent, is to be avoided, because of the intra-articular load in the knee;</UL>
<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Long distance walking, with similar considerations as climbing; the worker may need a pass to park close to the plant; and</UL>
<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Operating foot controls.</UL>
<P><B>Foot and Ankle:</B> For the foot and ankle, patients might need to be restricted from operating foot controls, climbing, and walking.
<P><B>Time Restrictions:</B> In some cases it may be most successful to combine physical restrictions with limitations on the number of hours per day the employee works. In other cases it may be feasible to allow unrestricted physical RTW, but part-time at first. A representative schedule for graduated RTW is:

<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Four hours daily for the first two weeks;</UL>

<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Six hours daily for the following two weeks;</UL>
<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Eight hours daily for two weeks;</UL>
<UL><IMG SRC="REDBULLE.GIF" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">Unlimited hours, including daily and weekly overtime.</UL> 
<P>Only rarely, for example after protracted time off, will it be necessary to start the patient at two hours daily. Sometimes, particularly in the case of very deconditioned workers, an interval longer than two weeks before each time increase will prove helpful. In all these cases, the clinician should re-examine the employee before the initial RTW and at least once again before unlimited RTW, with interval examinations if required.
<P><B>Permanent Restrictions:</B> Returning the injured worker to the same job he or she previously held is the primary goal. Despite all efforts in this direction, however, there are occasions when it is in the patient's best interest to recommend a permanent job change. The overriding reason is usually the existence of ongoing physical limitations that are not likely to change. For example, after a back operation, very heavy lifting while in the bent position in most cases should be avoided permanently. This is not a decision to be taken lightly. The process of vocational retraining represents a significant disruption in most lives (sometimes more than remaining on "no work" status.) The practitioner should always be guided by what is best for the patient, not what is best for the insurance company or employer. These considerations will then naturally benefit all concerned. The patient who returns to work prematurely or to a job that cannot be physically tolerated undoubtedly will sustain another injury--to the detriment of the employer, insurer, and most importantly to the employee and his or her family. Conversely, continuing to authorize time off work for someone who physically could return clearly benefits none of the interested parties.
<P>A prerequisite for the determination of permanent disability is the medical opinion that unlimited duty likely will lead to further injury or re-injury. A patient may be able to return to work at the prior position, but will he or she be able to sustain the physical demands into the indefinite future with little likelihood of further damage? Job site analyses, functional capacity evaluations, and the clinician's own expertise and experience can contribute to the answer. The vocational counselor has expertise in working with the disabled worker to find suitable subsequent placement, preferably with the same employer. Once the permanent restrictions have been specified, however, the physician remains available to determine whether a specific job falls within those conditions.
<P>A specific, accurate diagnosis is the necessary prerequisite for successful rehabilitation of the injured worker. Often, the period following treatment of the acute injury is the most challenging to the clinician. With the guidelines outlined above--varied as necessary by the circumstances of individual cases--the circle of rehabilitation can be closed with the injured worker's uneventful re-entry into the workplace.

<H1>Pediatric Night Splints</H1>
<P><I>by Ronald L. Valmassy, DPM</I>
</CENTER> 
<P>A host of lower extremity splints, braces and bars are available to assist in the treatment of lower extremity pediatric deformities such as angle-of-gait disturbances and flat-footed conditions. Designed for use following periods of serial plaster immobilization, the devices often can be used in lieu of that form of therapy. Splints and braces also may be used to maintain or enhance the results of corrective surgery of the lower extremity. Night splints are among the most commonly prescribed, but the practicitoner must take into consideration a number of variables to ensure success.
<P><B>Normal versus Abnormal:</B> Before prescribing any night splint or bracing system, the practitioner must have a working knowledge of what is normal in the developing child and what is not so that a decision can be made on whether or not a presenting complaint is indeed abnormal.
<P><B>Type and Level of Deformity:</B> Splinting techniques can be used to correct specific foot conditions that include metatarsus adductus, talipes equino varus, and talipes calcaneaovalgus. However, it is imperative that the practitioner determine the extent and severity of the deformity to ensure that more aggressive treatment isn't initially required. Although mild cases of any of the above conditions may improve via regular stretching, shoe therapy, and splinting techniques, moderate to severe cases unquestionably require more aggressive therapy. When surgical intervention or serial plaster immobilization is required, splinting and bracing become secondary lines of treatment. 
<P>Internal or external tibial position and torsion problems may respond well to splinting and bracing, particularly in mild to moderate cases. In more severe cases, splints and braces may be used subsequent to serial plaster immobilization to maintain the correction. 
<P>Generally speaking, internal and external femoral torsions do not respond well to splinting techniques because it is difficult for appropriate pressure to be placed proximal enough to precipitate any measurable osseous changes. However, all children with either a marked internal or external femoral torsion ultimately will develop some degree of soft-tissue adaptation or contracture. In addition, youngsters with a primary internal femoral position or external femoral position will have increased soft-tissue adaptation due to their sleeping positions. Therefore, congenital soft-tissue contracture may occur primarily in some children or secondary to an osseous deformity as described above. Arguably then, night splints may be used effectively in either condition primarily to alter the sleeping position and thereby secondarily to stretch associated contracted soft-tissue structures.
<P><B>Types of Splint:</B> Over the years, a host of splints and braces have been used to assist in the development of a normal lower extremity. Generally speaking, the type and severity of the deformity determine the type of splint. However, it is common for multiple deformities to present in the same child. For example, a metatarsus adductus foot type may be exacerbated by the presence of an internal femoral torsion or position or possibly an internal tibial torsion or position. In cases of multiple deformities, splints and braces capable of affecting each of the involved areas should be chosen. 
<P>For a device that is affixed to the patient's shoe, selection may be influenced by the materials used in the fabrication of the device, its overall flexibility or rigidity, ease of application, and, finally, the actual cost of the device.
<P><B>Age of the Patient:</B> The "golden age" for treating pediatric rotational and torsional abnormalities is under one year of age, and the most successful treatment results generally are obtained between the ages of three and twelve months. Unfortunately, many of the more common rotational deformities become apparent only after a child has started walking, and most treatment plans are not initiated until that time. Overall, all braces and bars become less efficient as the child develops and as the deformity persists untreated.
<P>Most splinting techniques are well-tolerated by the pediatric patient up to the age of two or three years, at which time the child may become uncomfortable or agitated by the restrictive nature of the splint or brace. Interestingly, some children tolerate the brace effectively up to the age of five or six. 
<P><B>Length of Treatment:</B> Before initiating treatment with splints and braces, the practitioner should provide the parents with an estimate of the time required for the therapy to be successful. In the broadest sense, treatment must continue long enough to clinically alter positional or torsional changes, and the corrected position must be maintained for an additional period of time. Generally speaking, the more severe the deformity, the longer the treatment period. If the initial treatment involves serial plaster immobilization, the splinting or bracing period generally lasts for at least twice as long as the initial casting sequence. In more severe cases in which surgery precedes the period of serial plaster immobilization, the bracing and splinting period might extend to three times the length of the casting sequence. 
<P>Overall, the splinting or bracing system should be used as much as possible throughout the day. A younger child should wear the brace or splint while sleeping at night and during naps. If the brace or splint is flexible or is worn only on one limb, the device should be used for longer periods of time throughout the day.
<P>Regardless of the form of treatment employed, approximately 10 percent of all lower extremity deformities persist into adult life. Therefore, sometimes it is appropriate to terminate treatment when no changes become clinically evident after three to four months.
<P><B>Extent of Correction:</B> Sometimes overcorrection becomes a problem. If a child initially is unable to wear a splint or brace because of excessive correction and subsequent discomfort, the child may become uncooperative, and further efforts--even with the reduction of correction--often are unsuccessful. One way of dealing with the level of correction is initially to set the splint or bar at a minimum degree of correction. This allows the child to become accustomed to the introduction of a new force or pressure on the limb. The practitioner should calculate the available range of motion of the hip, knee, tibia, ankle and foot, and use this information to determine the available range of motion present in the individual child. It is then possible to slowly increase the correction in the bar or splint to a level that is well tolerated by the youngster. 
<P>Care must be taken not to be overly aggressive when implementing treatment for internal problems via splinting or bracing. Excessive external rotation of the limb may lead to an avascular necrosis of the femoral head. In treating an externally-rotated limb, take care not to adduct the hip excessively, as this may precipitate a dislocated hip.  Since a dislocatable hip cannot be accurately diagnosed either clinically or radiographically beyond four months of age, caution must be exercised not to excessively adduct an externally deviated limb.
<P><B>Maintenance of Normal Anatomic Relationships:</B> One of the long-standing concerns regarding splinting and bracing techniques involves the potential for the devices to precipitate subluxatory changes in the developing child's foot. Normal structural and functional alterations of the lower extremity should not be achieved at the expense of midtarsal and subtalar joint stability. 
<P>The majority of splints and braces act initially at the point of least resistance; namely, the foot. To minimize subluxatory changes in the foot, several modifications may be introduced into the more static or stationary devices, such as placing a 15-20 degrees varus bend in the bar portion of specific splints (Ganley, Denis Browne, Fillauer), or placing a triplane or varus wedge in the heel seat of each shoe. The combination of these two anti-pronation measures maintains a subtalar joint in an inverted position, resulting in a locking of the midtarsal joint. Thus, when an external force is directed against the internally rotated limb, the foot moves as a unit, maintaining its structural stability and integrity. If the splint or brace is available in several widths, measure the distance across the child's shoulders or the distance from one anterior-superior iliac spine to the other, and add one inch.
<P><B>Appropriate Shoes:</B> As a rule, a stiff-countered leather-soled shoe is recommended for mounting to any of the splinting or bracing systems requiring a shoe. Although some splints and braces may be used in conjunction with an existing shoe, the practitioner should evaluate the shoe for any evidence that it may have adapted to the child's deformity. For example, a child with a metatarsus adductus deformity may have broken down the existing shoes to the point where the deformity could be exacerbated, in which case the shoe should not be used. 
<P>When possible, open-toed shoes should be used to ensure adequate ventilation and provide room for growth. If a closed-toe shoe is selected, the toebox of the shoe should be cut away. If the shoes will be worn for a prolonged period of time (from six to twelve months), they can be cut along the vamp and into the tongue to allow for expansion of the foot width.
<P>Since a child's foot and leg remain adaptable and plastic during the first eight years of development, every effort should be made to allow the osseous and soft-tissue structures to develop normally, especially when using any of the splints, braces, or bars described.

<H1>EPF Can Be Performed Safely</H1>
<BR>
<FONT=+4><B>EPF must be objectively and carefully compared to open plantar fascial release in terms of pain relief, recovery time, cost, and long-term results.</B></FONT> 
<P><I>by Jason H. Calhoun, MD, and Terry A. Siller, MD</I> 
</CENTER>

<P>Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common foot problems physicians encounter today. Conservative care measures such as anti-inflammatory medications, orthotic devices (heel cushions and cups), stretching exercises, and steroid injections--associated with an 85 to 95 percent success rate--still are the primary modes of treatment. However, approximately 10 percent of all patients will have recalcitrant heel pain that is disabling and unresponsive after nine to 12 months of conservative care. This relatively small group of patients likely will be candidates for surgery. 
<P>Considerable controversy has arisen over the surgical treatment of plantar fasciitis since BioMechanics published an article on the subject authored by Lowell Scott Weil, DPM [<I>Rape of the Plantar Fasciotomy,</I> July/August 1994]. The debate centers on the benefits of open versus endoscopic plantar fascial release (EPF). In our experience, EPF is a good alternative to open plantar fascial release when conservative treatment fails.
<P>EPF release is designed to minimize surgical trauma, decrease postoperative pain, and allow patients to return to work more quickly. While only a limited number of foot and ankle surgeons are currently evaluating this procedure, early clinical results have been quite good. Stephen Barrett, DPM, who is responsible for developing this procedure, has reported a 95 percent success rate with EPF in 65 cases. Long term follow-up results are still unknown, however.
<P>In an in-depth anatomical analysis of endoscopic plantar fascial releases performed on 18 fresh-frozen cadavers, Dr. Jason H. Calhoun, and his colleague Bryan Hawkins, MD, of The University of Texas Medical Branch, demonstrated that the procedure can be performed safely--and consistently--without damaging vital neurovascular structures. The first branch of the lateral plantar nerve, thought to be at highest risk, was not injured in any of the cadavers. While partial release of the plantar fascia was possible, controlling the exact percentage of the fascia release was more difficult. A 75 percent release was attempted with each specimen but the fascial release averaged 82 percent. A greater precision possibly could be gained with further experience. Release of the deep fascia of the abductor hallucis muscle, a structure related to neural entrapment, was not possible with this approach.
<P>The surgical procedure is similar to endoscopic carpal tunnel release. We prefer a simple two portal technique since it allows for visualization of the anatomic structures from both the medial and lateral portals. A small, vertical .5 cm puncture incision is made at a point immediately anterior and inferior to the medial calcaneal tuberosity. The placement of the incision is based on the estimated location of the medial calcaneal tuberosity and the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve. A joker elevator is used to identify the superior and inferior edges of the fascia through indirect palpation, and to clear soft tissue from the inferior surface of the fascia. Once the fascia is cleared, the slotted endoscopic cannula/trocar system is passed plantar to the fascia across the bottom of the foot. The trocar is then palpated laterally through the skin. A vertical incision is placed over the tip of the trocar laterally and the trocar/cannula system is then exited laterally. The cannula should stay in contact with the undersurface of the fascia during the entire procedure. We use the Smith and Nephew-Dyonics ECTRA 2 endoscopy set with a 30 degree arthroscope to visualize the plantar fascia. The endoscopic cannula is oriented so that the open slot points vertically and the endoscope is introduced from the medial side, although some prefer the lateral portal. 
<P>Cotton-tipped swabs are used to clean the undersurface of the fascia until it is seen clearly. While the medial edge of the fascia is easily identifiable, the lateral border of the fascia usually blends with local fatty tissue and is not as evident as the medial border. A probe can be used to delineate the lateral edge of the fascia through indirect palpation. Once the edges are well defined, a disposable endoscopic cutting blade is used to incise the fascia under direct vision at a point approximately three-fourths of the width of the facia from the medial border. A full thickness fascial release is performed, often requiring more than one pass with the cutting blade. No attempt should be made to disturb the underlying muscle, which can be clearly seen when the fascia is completely cut. Marcaine is then injected into the operative site and the portals are closed with single, absorbable stitches followed by steri-strips. A soft dressing, Ace wrap, and a postoperative shoe are then applied. 
<P>Possible complications include nerve injuries, postoperative lateral column pain, and arch collapse, which possibly can be eliminated with continued refinement of the technique and changes in postoperative care
<P>Major advantages of endoscopic plantar fascial release include decreased surgical dissection, shorter operative time, decreased postoperative pain, and a relatively quick return to work. Utilization of day surgery units, local anesthetic techniques, and minor operating rooms also can decrease costs. Disadvantages include increased equipment costs and the inability to release the deep fascia of the abductor hallucos muscle when nerve entrapment is suspected. EPF is not indicated when nerve entrapment is a major component of the patient's pain. Also, the endoscope does not allow for removal of masses on bone spurs. 
<P>As with all new procedures, there is a temptation to overutilize the procedure. While the risk of overuse is a major concern, it is not a judicious reason for complete rejection of this new procedure, as some have argued. 
<P>Clearly, multicenter clinical trials are needed to objectively and carefully compare EPF to open plantar fascial release in terms of pain relief, recovery time, cost, and long term results. In the meantime, we will continue to use and further evaluate EPF at our institution and feel that is a useful technique when conservative treatment of intractable plantar fasciitis fails.

<H1>An Approach to Diabetic Wound Management</H1>
<P><I>by Ian H. Beiser, DPM</I> 
</CENTER>

<P>There are a variety of reasons for the development of ulcers in diabetics. Since not all wounds are the same, each new ulcer must be individually evaluated to determine the causative factors. These factors can then be addressed in a systematic manner to encourage healing.
<P>The history and physical exam will provide much of the information needed to begin a treatment plan. Of particular importance are the patient's vascular status, neurologic status, dermatological status, the foot-type (i.e. rigid cavus foot, rocker-bottom foot), and the presence of bony deformities. Additional information including radiographic studies and lab tests to determine metabolic, nutrition, and wound-healing potential (Hgb/Hct, white count, albumin, HgbAlc etc.) also are important.
<P>If the wound is infected, antibiotics are begun and purulence, if present, is drained. Debridement of necrotic tissue follows. All ulcers are not necessarily infected. With all other clinical signs and symptoms being negative, positive culture swabs and gram stains may represent colonization on the surface of the ulcer and not a true infection.
<P>Although an infection such as cellulitis or an abscess may precede an ulcer, a plantar ulcer often develops due to mechanical causes or ischemic necrosis. Secondary infection may follow. In either case, the infection must be addressed and weightbearing eliminated to prevent the infection from spreading through the tissue planes.
<P>Many patients who present with plantar ulcers have an adequate vascular supply. Those diabetics whose vascular supply is inadequate tend to have an occlusion in the femero-popliteal segments or in the tibial or peroneal arteries. Modern revascularization techniques (e.g., Fem-pop and fem-distal bypasses) are often quite successful at salvaging the ischemic foot.
<P>Patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy are especially susceptible to ulcers, which can be caused by several mechanisms including local ischemic necrosis, mechanical disruption, enzymatic autolysis, and infection. When treating an ulcer, it is inherent that the ulcer is physically off-loaded to allow healing to occur. A majority of chronic, mal perforans ulcers that have been treated unsuccessfully with hyperbaric oxygen, various growth factors and topical solutions will close rather quickly once the inflammation and enzymatic autolysis is halted by reducing the plantar pressure.
<P>Healing sandals can provide a quick, easy, and effective way to initiate a reduction of weightbearing pressure to an ulcer site. A pedorthist or doctor with a small lab in his office can fabricate one in a matter of minutes from an ordinary post-op shoe (such as a Darco or Reese shoe) and a sheet of 1/4-inch-thick pink Plastazote. Trace and cut the Plastazote to fit the shoe, and secure with rubber cement. The Plastazote forms to the patient's foot as he ambulates, distributing weight more evenly over the bottom of the foot and protecting the ulcer site. A molded inlay may be used but is not always necessary. 
<P>Total contact casting can also be used to off-load an ulcer and allow the patient to ambulate. The cast causes a more even distribution of weight on the plantar aspect of the foot, helping the leg to assist in carrying weight, thus reducing weightbearing pressure to the foot. The cast is changed periodically to allow for inspection of the wound, debridement and the prevention of excessive cast loosening as leg edema diminishes.
<P>With an infected wound, an antiseptic ointment or solution may be a beneficial dressing. Many antiseptics, however, such as full strength Betadine (10 percent povidone iodine) have been shown to be detrimental to granulating tissue. Some maintain that certain strengths of diluted antiseptic solutions may be strong enough to serve their primary role while rendering the product non-toxic to new tissue cells. A popular, safe, nontoxic dressing is saline.
<P>While various growth factors have been recently promoted, think of them as an adjunct to treatment, not a panacea. Most ulcers will close if primary etiologic factors are addressed. Certainly combination types of ulcers exist and attention must be given to all problems areas. Also, some patients with a history of neuropathic ulcers and adequate vascular status may develop peripheral vascular disease at a later date.
<P>Once the ulcer is finally closed, maintenance of the closure is accomplished with an accommodative orthosis. A bi/tri-density, molded inlay may be used, and will usually require a deep depth or molded shoe. Often a rocker-bottom sole with a steel shank will help reduce the stress of propulsion. When increased stability or additional weightbearing reduction is needed, braces such as a double-upright or PTB (patellar tendon-bearing) also may be indicated.
<P>Surgical salvage or reconstructive procedures may be required. For example, a patient with an altered metatarsal weightbearing pressure pattern who has had prior resections of one or more metatarsal heads may develop recurrent plantar ulcers in spite of molded shoes and other conservative means of attempted pressure reduction. This patient may benefit from a pan-metatarsal head resection or a reconstructive surgical procedure to provide a better weightbearing pattern. The surgical procedure followed by accommodative orthoses and deep depth or molded shoes may dramatically reduce recurrence.

<H1>Radiological Imaging of the Foot and Ankle</H1>
<P><I>by Thomas Lee, MD; Sheldon Lin, MD; Keith Wapner, MD; and Paul Hecht, MD</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Radiological imaging of the ankle and foot has continued to develop in conjunction with rapid advances of new surgical techniques and increased understanding of lower extremity pathology. Understanding the scientific basis behind each modality is critical in obtaining the proper radiological study.
<H2>Routine Radiographs</H2>
Plain radiographs continue to be the mainstay of ankle and foot imaging. As part of the initial work-up, routine radiographs are required to evaluate the structural anatomy for any possible fractures or osseous lesions. Additional radiographs or supplemental views may be necessary in order to address a questioned area or to clarify the initial findings. 
<H2>Radiographic Evaluation of Ankle</H2>
Routine radiographic series of an ankle includes AP, lateral, and internal oblique (mortise) views. These radiographics foster rapid evaluation of the normal osseous structures. The AP view of the ankle allows evaluation of the tibiotalar joint, distal aspect of the tibia and fibula as well as the regions of the talar dome.
<H2>Weightbearing Views</H2>
Radiographs of the foot and ankle must include views taken during weightbearing. Without this view, effect of weightbearing, ligamentous laxity, or other pathological conditions of the foot and ankle maybe misdiagnosed or missed all together.
<P>AP and lateral weightbearing views of the ankle are useful to evaluate the effect of normal stresses upon the ankle ligaments (deltoid, lateral ligaments) and the tibiotalar joint. Ideally, AP views of both ankles should be obtained simultaneously to evaluate the symmetry of the tibiotalar joint for its width and tibiotalar tilt. Understanding the normal anatomy and the possibility of anatomic variants is necessary to properly interpret the radiographic films in the context of the clinical situation.
<H2>Nuclear Medicine</H2>
Nuclear medicine imaging is based on the development and use of short acting radionucleides. Following the administration of a radiopharmaceutical agent, a gamma camera tracks and records the radiopharmaceutical distribution onto film or computer. Nuclear imaging is unique as it provides a dual evaluation of the anatomic and physiological processes of the osseous structure.
<P>Indications for nuclear medicine imaging include evaluation for primary tumors, metastatic process, metabolic disorders, trauma, avascular necrosis, infections, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and pain of unknown etiology.
<P>Various bone scan indications include screening the skeletal system for metastatic process, evaluating the foot or ankle for pain of unknown etiology, evaluating for occult fractures, and to determine if reflex sympathetic dystrophy is present.
<H2>Ultrasound</H2>
Relying on sound waves, ultrasound produces images and Doppler information without risk of radiation.
<P>Medical imaging ultrasound uses sound waves with frequencies ranging from 3-10 MHz. These waves are pulsed into the area of interest and bounced back for computer processing into an image. Doppler information is obtained by processing the Doppler shift frequency changes to characterize a moving structure.
<P>Indications for the use of ultrasound include musculotensinous injuries, masses, abscess, foreign bodies, and vascular disease. Ultrasound is particularly useful when evaluating the Achilles tendon. 
<H2>Computerized Tomography</H2>
Computerized tomagraphy (CT) has become a major cornerstone in imaging of the foot and ankle. The scientific basis behind CT is a rotatory radiographic beam from a gantry that directs fan shaped patterns of radiographic beams through the imaged part of the body. This beam is attenuated by the anatomic structures, and detected by a ring of fixed radiographic detectors. Absorption of the beam is related to a number of factors including the atomic number of the material and the density of the imaged tissue. 
<P>Computerized Tomography has the ability to image areas often difficult to see or previously undiagnosed by plain radiographs. Also, rapid evaluation of complex foot and ankle osseous structures is easily obtained with the thin section serial imaging. Finally, both the soft tissue and osseous structures may be evaluated simultaneously with little if any interference from the outside dressing or cast.
<P>Indeed, CT has become a widely used imaging technique for evaluation of clinical problems of the foot and ankle. Indications for its use include arthritis, fractures, ostenchondral lesions, neoplasms, infections, foreign bodies, and congenital abnormalities. 
<H2>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</H2>
The MRI has revolutionized the imaging and treatment of ankle and foot pathologies. By virtue of its direct multi-planar imaging capability and superior contrast resolution for cartilage, marrow, and soft tissue pathology, MRI easily supersedes computerized tomography in various applications. 
<P>A typical MRI examination of the foot and ankle consists of T1 and T2 weighted images in the axial, coronal, or sagittal planes. With the MRI, one may determine the direction and extent of tumor involvement or an infection process. With an introsseous tumor, for example, the longitudinal imaging plane may best be utilized to determine the extent and length of the tumor. Since the MRI uses radio frequency electromagnetic waves and a strong magnetic field, one major advantage is the absence of radiation exposure.
<P>This procedure also allows technicians to differentiate between osseous and soft tissue structures. Other indications include pathological involvement of the tendons, as well as acute and chronic tendon tears, including tenosynovitis, pseudocyst formation, and post-surgical changes.

The world is increasingly active and more prone to injury. Body care is more managed. Enter <B>ADJUSTABRACE<FONT SIZE=1><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> 3</B>, an advanced post-op rehabilitative knee brace. Achieve better outcomes through the <B>AB3's</B> many superior design features. For example, our bi-pivotal <B>SWIFTLOK<FONT SIZE=1><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT></B> hinge mechanism uses two adjustors as continuously variable limiters for flexion and extension. Set the hinges for any range of motion, or lock at any desired knee flexion angle. <B>AB3's</B> hinge arms are fitted with flexible nylon thigh and calf shells which can be repositioned and secured in just a few seconds using thumbwheels. Hemi-circumferential straps prevent circumferential migration. Best of all, you'll achieve better compliance with the <B>AB3</B>. It's patient-ready and patient-friendly. The <B>AB3</B> also has an easy-to-understand patient how-to video available on request. Less effort on your part, more compliance by your patient.

<P>

Life is wonderful, but sometimes a tumble. Care is more managed. Enter the <B>FLOAM<FONT SIZE=1><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> ANKLE STIRRUP BRACE</B>, an advanced and cost-effective ankle stirrup. Achieve better outcomes through the <B>AS3's</B> high-tech materials design. For example, our two polypropylene outer shells are lined with unique <B>FLOAM<FONT SIZE=1><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT></B> bladders to provide a more uniform compression and custom fit. <B>FLOAM<FONT SIZE=1><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT></B> is 50 percent lighter than most cushioning materials and has no memory. Nor does <B>FLOAM<FONT SIZE=1><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT></B> react to changes in hot and cold environments. So compression conforms to body shape, yet bony prominences are not pressured.
<P>
Best of all, you'll achieve better compliance with the <B>AS3</B>. It's patient-ready and patient-friendly. The <B>AS3</B> is an easy-to-understand universal brace. Less inventory for you to carry, better compliance for the patient.

Patient compliance and better outcomes is more important than ever. Enter the Johnson &#38; Johnson Orthopaedics <B>MASTERHINGE<FONT SIZE=1><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT></B> Hip Hinge product line.

All versions are supplied with a <B>MASTERHINGE<FONT SIZE=1><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT></B> headplate attached and may be cast-in, using Specialist&#174;, Delta-Lite&#174;, or other casting materials.

<H2>The CONTOUR<FONT SIZE=1><SUP> TM</SUP></FONT> Lower Leg Walker:</H2>
Helps you treat soft and hard tissue ankle injuries whether traumatic or surgicaly induced by temporarily supporting full weight-bearing activity during rehabilitation. We married a rigid shell-like housing for maximum immobilization with a brushed nylon "breathable" sock, to produce a rugged, yet comfortable walker to encourage greater patient compliance. "Rocker-type" gripping bottom constructed of heavy duty rubber offers natural heel strike and toe off under even harsh conditions. Easy on and off with Texacro&#169; hook and loop fasteners.
<P>The <B>NEXTEP<FONT SIZE=1><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> CONTOUR<FONT SIZE=1><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT></B>  is available in small, medium, or large, and is indicated for:

<I>Introducing Theraform Selectives -- By Benefoot</I>
</H2>
<HR>
<I>Theraform Selectives</I><FONT SIZE=-2>(TM)</FONT> <I>have been designed by 
Dr. Sheldon Langer and the Benefoot technical staff to be efficacious, 
comprehensive, customizable and easy to use. The product line covers a 
wide range of patient needs at an affordable "managed care" price.</I><IMG SRC="/mall/benefoot/ort2.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="261" HEIGHT="132">

<P><I><B>Efficacious.</B></I> Creating efficacious, technologically superior biomechanical 
products is nothing new at Benefoot. What's new is Theraform Selectives -- a comprehensive array
of prefabricated foot orthotics. Theraform Selectives is the result of melding our extensive
knowledge of orthotic material with our unparalleled expertise in biomechanics.

<P><IMG SRC="/mall/benefoot/ort3.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="206" HEIGHT="157"><I><B>Comprehensive.</B></I> The Theraform Selectives line
consists of ten advanced laminate shells. These shells possess distinctive functional properties
ranging from protective and accommodative to functional and controlling. The ten different shells
offer practitioners a comprehensive range of orthotic devices to treat all of their orthotic 
patients.

<P><I><B>Customizable.</B></I> Each Theraform Selectives shell can be customized with top covers,
forefoot and rearfoot posts, met pads, etc. These customizable components can either be purchased
separately or added to your orthotics at the laboratory by our trained technicians.

<P><IMG SRC="/mall/benefoot/ort1.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="228" HEIGHT="181"><I><B>Easy To Use.</B></I> We have created the Theraform Selectives Orthotic Guide to assist you 
in the proper selection of orthotics for your patients. The Orthotic Guide provides clinical indications
and a complete description of the material's properties for each device.

<H1>BERGMANN SCANNER/ MODEL 2001</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>Bergmann Lab is proud to announce the latest addition to their optical casting systems. 
Casting your patient has never been quicker, easier or more accurate. Unlike other foot 
scanners that are used just to replace plaster casting, with our new system you get even 
more, much, much more. 

<P>The Model 2001 is the only scanner that images more than just the plantar aspect of the 
foot. It also images the medial, lateral, and posterior aspects of the foot and ankle, 
which is so important when manufacturing all the types and styles of orthotics from leather 
to plastic. 

<P>Our casting system is the only one that gives you comprehensive diagnostic and patient 
presentation softwaret. The diagnostic software has a wide range of uses, from measuring 
the declination angle of the first metatarsal to evaluating changes in ulcer or wound depth 
and size over time. The patient biomechanical presentation software will truly impress and 
inform your patients about their condition in an easily understood manner.  All screen images 
can be printed out on a wide range of printers from black and white to color. 

<P>With our modular open architectural design, your system will not become obsolete. It has 
the capacity to adapt and use new technologies as they are developed. The Model 2001-- a system 
that will truly expand your orthotic practice by raising your orthotic treatment to a whole new 
level of biomechanical sophistication. Come grow with us.......

<P>Have your lab call us about compatibility.

<P>New scanner brochure available.

<IMG SRC="/mall/bergmann/2001.jpg" WIDTH=525 HEIGHT=673>
<BR><I>Casting your patients has never been quicker, easier or more accurate. With our exclusive 
stereo imaging technology, you now have the capability to consistently duplicate the foot contours 
necessary for accurate fabrication of custom orthotic devices.  If you are serious about custom 
orthotic casting, give us a call.</I>

happened, did you hurt your leg?' Since receiving the College Park TruStep Foot, I haven't had one question about
my leg. I now walk limp free. I am so confident, I no longer think twice about walking in front of the crowd, I
just do it. My TruStep Foot has also made it much easier to manuever on unlevel ground. My life is once again as

<FONT SIZE=+1>The <B>"S-I" Support</B> supports the base of the spine, allowing for lumbar mobility while providing pelvic stability. The "S-I" Support utilizes an anatomically compatible padding and tightening system that creates an extension force on the sacrum and a compressive force on the soft tissues and joint surfaces of the sacroiliac region. These combined forces from the back, coupled with the posterior iliac rotation force from the front converge to create SACROILIAC STABILIZATION.</FONT>

</TABLE>

<P>
<I>The first line management in any actue musculoskeletal syndrome is rest or restriction from destructive activity. Protection of injured tissues by minimizing and reducing forces is imperative for the initiation of proper healing. Supporting injured tissues during progressive movement retraining programs (rehabilitation) is essential for successful low back management.</I>

Joint Solutions' Sure Step Brace

<CENTER>
<H1>The One Brace For All Your Ankles</H1>
</CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Take your patients from injury to action in the one brace that does it all: <B>Sure Step</B>. Utilizing patented footplate technology, Sure Step provides superior support through superior control. Sure Step, your <I>one step</I> ankle support system.</FONT>
<BR>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="/mall/jointsolutions/leg.jpg" WIDTH="265" HEIGHT="322" ALT="the SureStep Brace">
</CENTER>
<BR>
<I>When Joint Solutions set out to develop a totally unique new fixed position ankle brace, they looked to a basic philosophy as a guide: if you don't support the foot, you cannot support the ankle. The result is the Sure Step Ankle Support System, a unique combination of form and function.
<P>
Sure Step's patented footplate technology provides the best foundation of any ankle brace available and allows the Sure Step to offer a unique fixed position option, which helps stabilize the ankle in a neutral position and is ideal for immobilization of unstable sprains and simple fractures.
<P>
Also useful for neuro injury patients, the Sure Step fixed ankle position bridges the gap between standard ankle stirrups and an ankle foot orthosis by providing superior medial lateral support and stable foot control in an affordable package. The Sure Step Fixed Position allows limited plantarflexion while helping to correct equinovarus and provides a mild dorsiflex assist. When a standard stirrup brace does not provide the desired level of support and an ankle foot orthosis is prohibitive, Sure Step is the logical choice.
<P>
With the ability to convert from a fixed position to a functional brace using a simple screwdriver, the Sure Step offers unparalleled flexibility in an off the shelf ankle brace. For the best in both form and function, choose Sure Step.</I>

The combination of our patented urethane with a total surface weight- bearing socket design has given amputees around the world new-found freedom.
<P>
<IMG SRC="/mall/tec/leg.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="283" ALIGN="RIGHT">
The properties of urethane allow it to cope with multi-directional forces and compensate for daily volume changes. The total surface weight-bearing socket design creates a more anatomically correct and functionally sound socket.

Our interface systems are custom-made for each individual, so you are guaranteed a fit that was meant just for you.
<P>
Along with interface systems, TEC&#174; also manufactures the UltraLink <FONT SIZE=1> TM</FONT> suspension sleeve, custom orthotics (inlcuding shoe inserts) and has the technology to produce socket designs with a CAD/CAM machine. Let TEC&#174; Interface Systems help simplify your life.

Before wearing <B>The Reliever</B>, tormenting medial osteoarthritis limited his physical activities. Now he golfs pain-free four days a week and carries a three handicap. No wonder he's happy.
<P>
While we brace hundreds of professional and collegiate athletes each year, the majority of the patients we help are normal everyday people who don't want a knee injury or OA pain to compromise their work or play.
<P>
Independent physician studies have consistently rated Townsend's custom instabilities brace as the best available. Our orthotists have incorporated these same performance-proven, patented Townsend features into <B>The Reliever</B>--a revolutionary new OA brace that is enhancing the health and quality of life of patients across the country.
<P>
If you haven't seen or tested <B>The Reliever</B> or <B>Air Townsend</B>, call us for more information. We guarantee our braces will make your patients smile, too.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>RESIDENCY GENESIS PAYS OFF
 FOR SCHOLL CLASS OF 1996</B></FONT>
 
 <P><B>CHICAGO --</B> Scholl College's commitment to residency genesis has paid off 
 for members of this year's graduating class. At a time when there is a 
 shortfall in graduate medical education opportunities, nearly all Scholl 
 College graduates will go into residency training.
 While four members of the Class of 1996 will go on to medical school, 
 96 of the college's 103 graduates have been placed in hospital-based 
 accredited residency programs. Two graduates will enter preceptorships 
 and one graduate was not eligible for placement at this time.
 
<P>"Back in 1988 we recognized the growing disparity between the number 
of students seeking residency programs and the number of available 
positions," said Dr. William Finn, Scholl's director of external 
programs. "Our board of directors took initiative then and introduced 
its Residency Genesis Program to provide grants to support development 
of new hospital-based residencies."
<P>Scholl College has since expended nearly $2.2 million on residency 
genesis. The program has led to the creation of 75 new residency 
positions in 15 states.  This year alone, the college's board of 
directors has authorized almost $600,000 to support the program.
 
<P>"Colleges of podiatric medicine are unique among health care-related 
educational institutions in that they must help fund residency programs 
for their graduates," said Scholl Executive Vice President Terence B. 
Albright, who will assume the presidency of the college next January. He 
adds that this fact coupled with proposed federal funding cuts in 
 graduate medical education has made residency training one of the most 
 controverial issues the profession faces today.  

<P>Scholl alumni have become actively involved in residency genesis.  Not 
 only have they identified potential sites for adding or developing new 
 hospital-based residency positions, they also are now entering the arena 
 of helping to fund the residency genesis effort.
<P>Dr. Lowell Scott Weil, a prominent Chicago-area podiatric surgeon, 
Scholl alum (1964) and member of the college's board of directors, has 
announced that one-half of his major Pathway to Excellence gift to the 
college is to be earmarked for residency development. "Dr. Weil has been a leader in the area of surgical training and 
education and we're extremely pleased that he is taking this action," 
said Dr. Finn. "We hope that other Scholl alums will follow his lead 
and join forces with the college to address this national issue. It is 
an important way to have tremendous impact on the future of our 
profession."

<HR>
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/just.jpg" WIDTH=141 HEIGHT=282 ALIGN=RIGHT>
The main street of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, could be the central road through any hamlet in rural Germany. This small, sleepy, working class town lies a half hour north of the Gettysburg battlefields and a half hour west of Pennsylvania Dutch Amish country. Many of the buildings date back to the early 1800s and have been lovingly maintained to retain their storybook European look. Only the automobile traffic struggling through the narrow road concedes what century this is. Close to the center of town, one quaint shop's shingle reads "Just Clogs." This unassuming sign serves as a beacon to clog lovers everywhere. When shop owner Gerry Joyce opens the store at 10:00 am, there's often a car waiting outside. "We've come from Roanoke, Virginia. We heard you have clogs. They're the only thing I can wear since my surgery."
<P>The stories vary, but always end with the customer's relief that here, finally, they can purchase the clogs they've been searching for.
<P>Gerry Joyce has been here for 17 years, selling clogs to people from all over the country. How they hear about her store, she doesn't know. But they come from Florida, New York, Arizona. They drive down from Maine or up from North Carolina. Maybe they have a sister in nearby Harrisburg who saw an ad in the local paper, or know someone who drove past the shop on the way to the Book-of-the-Month Club warehouse on the outskirts of town. "Someone came in the other day saying he had come all the way from San Antonio, Texas. Of course he'd also come in to see his mother," says Gerry. 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/shelf.jpg" WIDTH=281 HEIGHT=226 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>There is no other place quite like Just Clogs. Its ceiling-to-floor shelves display hundreds of clogs in every imaginable color, material, size, and shape. There are clogs for men, women, and children. There are green clogs for gardening, white clogs for nurses, rubber clogs for chefs that can be thrown in the dishwasher when splattered with tomato sauce (the clogs, not the chef). There are bright red, royal purple, and forest green nubuck clogs. Some clogs feature straps, others sport cut-out, floral designs. There are wooden-soled clogs and high-tech EVA-soled clogs that only look like wood. Brand names include Danish Tradition, Romika, Sven, Clark's, Naot, Stegmann, LaPlume. 
<P>In 1979, when clogs were the rage and her daughters were having trouble finding them, Gerry noticed a small vacant storefront for rent. Almost as a lark, she opened the shop. Since then, Just Clogs has been selling clogs day-in, day-out, regardless of fashion trends. "I've resisted every attempt to rename the store," recounts Gerry. "I don't want to be just any other shoe store. I have a special focus here." There are a few sandals and a few clog-inspired high heeled dress shoes. But 90 percent of the inventory remains traditional, anatomically contoured, craftsman-quality, European-made clogs.
<P>"We did get in one line that we regret," admits Gerry, pointing to a much advertised brand of trendy American clogs occupying a round table near the cash register. "All the kids were asking for these. But when I got them in, they turned out to have flat, shapeless, non-cushioned footbeds. We feel bad about selling them. They're simply not good for the feet." 

<H2>A Clogged Market</H2>
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/blue.jpg" WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=77 ALIGN=RIGHT>
In Old English, "clogge" means a lump of wood. Wooden clogs have been around at least since the 11th or 12th century. They became the universal shoe for European peasants, farmers, and laborers during the Middle Ages (see <A HREF="#history">History of Clogs</A>). Over the centuries, clogs have remained part of European folkdress, periodically resurfacing as the latest fashion. But clogs have always enjoyed a following among the standing professions--surgeons, nurses, chefs, hairdressers, and others whose work requires them to stand on their feet for many hours each day, often on hard surfaces. 
<P>Think clogs and you may first picture Scandinavia, Holland, or the Germanic countries. And indeed, two of the bestselling brands of traditional wooden-soled clogs in Gerry's shop are produced by American immigrants from Sweden and Denmark. Marie and Sven Carlsson, who came from Sweden in 1950 to settle in the similar climate of Chisago, Minnesota, created Sven clogs. The wooden bases are imported from Austria and the shoes are finished in Minnesota. Sven clogs are curiously bendable, flexing slightly at the instep. 
<P>Danish Tradition clogs are manufactured in Draper, Utah. The company, Rocky Mountain Shoes, was started out of a garage 16 years ago by Ingemann and Mary Bendtsen, their son Clint and his wife, Marilyn. The clogs are made to order for about 100 accounts and business is booming. Both Sven and Danish Traditions find a loyal following for their traditional wooden-soled clogs. Why, when so many other manufacturers have switched to lighter- weight, more flexible soles? "Wood absorbs mositure and has a cool feel to the feet--you don't get that burning sensation after standing many hours," explains Sven Carlsson.
<P>Romika, a German clog manufacturer, offers a highly functional clog with flexible, lightweight EVA soles at perhaps the most reasonable prices around. Some styles come with removable insoles; indeed, you can buy two for the same shoe. The "comfort footbed" is recommended for all-day use. Another, called the "wellness footbed," with its nubby design, can be popped in to stimulate circulation and provide a relaxing effect, according to Romika. Romika may be better known for its extensive line of white leather nurses' clogs, which come in a dozen attractive styles--some with perforated uppers to promote air circulation.
<P>Haflinger, another quality German company, also exports boiled wool footwear to America. It offers a line of children's boiled wool slippers that rank high on the "cuteness" scale. The boiled wool process (see <A HREF="/stride/v1n1/market.html">Marketplace</A>, Winter 1995) creates a soft, dense, warm, moisture-wicking fabric upper that molds to the shape of your foot. Wool felt is a natural insulator, keeping feet warm in winter and cool in summer. 

<P>Speaking of wool felt, a phenomenal favorite in the German clog field is the Stegmann wool felt clog, a popular European "house shoe." In America, it has jumped from a favorite among senior citizens to a hot fashion statement by college students and high schoolers. Shoe stores carrying Stegmann's say they can't keep enough of them. "A college professor who stands on her feet for hours each day tells me she owns 13 pair," recounts Robert Lipson, who imports the product to America. The traditional Stegmann clog features an upper made of seamless boiled wool shaped to a shoe last. Stegmann adds a characteristic braid trim. What's great for feet and posture is a molded heel cup, as well as a cork and latex footbed that molds to the sole of your foot. And it's all attached to a shock-absorbing rubber outsole. But beware of imitators. The American market has been flooded with cheap Stegmann look-alikes selling for as little as $12 in discount chains. They are not "boiled wool" but a flimsy felt that falls apart like paper. And they lack the molded cork footbeds.
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/birk.jpg" WIDTH=206 HEIGHT=238 ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="All-polyurethane Birki Clogs in bright colors are especially popular with European gardening enthusiasts because they are easy to slip in and out of and can be hosed off after use.>
<P>Other German-made clogs with the cork-molded footbed include, of course, Birkenstock's backless Boston clog, and the Tokyo, which adds an adjustable backstrap. Birki Clogs, made of flexible waterproof polyurethane, are ideal for lab work, operating rooms, and commercial kitchens. These clogs can be sterilized with heats of up to 140 degrees. They also come in antistatic versions required for certain specialized manufacturing and medical applications. Some versions of the Birki Clog feature removable and/or replaceable contoured footbeds in either cork or polyurethane. Another German Shoe manufacturer, Josef Seibel, has long offered clogs which feature a nubby foot-massaging insole.

<P>Germany and Scandinavia, however, have not completely "clogged" the market. Italy, England, and Israel also have stepped in. An Italian company, Portania, uses soft, stretchy leather for its clog uppers. Portania's fur-lined clogs are favorites in cold-weather climes. LaPlume, 
 another Italian clogmaker, is known for soft suede clogs with lots of hand-stitching detail. Clarks of England's clogs include a steel shank within the polyurethane outsole for added stability. Its popular Joan model fits snug to the instep but retains the roomy toebox necessary for healthy fit. The Israeli comfort shoe company, Naot, offers a "Scandinavian collection" of clogs featuring the same molded cork, suede, and latex insoles and flexible polyurethane outsoles of its better-known sandals. Naot's four clog styles, appropriately named Sweden, Denmark, Copenhagen, and Iceland (with an adjustable strap), all have removable insoles.


<P>Every major American shoe company has jumped on the clogwagon this year. H.H. Brown's Born line, aimed at twenty-something Gen-Xers, offers two clogs with the "attitude" to attract younger buyers to durable comfort shoes. The Amsterdam features a woven upper made of such exceptionally soft leather it begs to be worn barefoot. The bottom is handsewn to the upper. Soft foam in the sole combats foot fatigue. 
<P>Two Easy Spirit clogs will hit retail stores in December. Their comfort features include polyurethane outsoles, molded footbeds, and adjustable backstraps.

<P>NaturalSport entered the market in 1994 with the Roma, designed by an Italian shoe artisan. NaturalSport's clogs feature soft leather uppers whip-stitched to lightweight, flexible soles with contoured footbeds. The company's full line of anatomical walking clogs have just been granted the APMA's Seal of Acceptance. 

<H2>A Physician's Favorite</H2>
<P>For the clog many doctors find most comfortable, check out Dansko, the U.S. distributor for the Danish company AS/Sanita, a longtime leader in the clog business. Lind Hall, DPM, of Goldsboro, North Carolina, wears Dansko and often recommends them to patients. Dr. Hall sees many patients who stand on their feet for long hours at Golbsboro's large turkey processing plants. "The construction of the Dansko clog encourages the foot to function like a rigid lever, enhancing propulsion as it limits overpronation (the foot rolling in during gait)," Hall says.
<P>To walk properly, the foot must pronate slightly. But overpronation, says Dr. Hall, is the source of many foot problems. An overpronating foot will more likely become fatigued after extended standing and walking. Worse, these feet are predisposed to other problems such as bunions, hammertoes, and heel pain, and are more likely to cause knee and spinal problems up the kinetic chain. Appropriate clog design reduces the tendency to overpronate in a number of ways, says Dr. Hall. In addition, the toebox is exceptionally roomy. This makes it a good choice for deformed feet, whether for slight deformities such as bunions or exaggerated deformities.
<P>Dr. Hall also recommends Dansko for those recovering from heel pain because: 1) the open or looseback design does not touch most of the heel, so there is little direct pressure on already tender areas; 2) the elevated heel design reduces tightness of attached ligaments and tendons; 3) the design limits overpronation that can cause or aggravate heel pain. 
<P>But some people find clogs uncomfortable or even dangerous. Tipping over is particularly a problem in the wooden-soled models, which have little give when walking. Whether or not you like clogs also depends on individual foot type. People with flatter feet tend not to feel comfortable in clogs. Some of these people can't tolerate even a few steps in clogs without feeling pain in their knees. Quite simply, clogs are not for everybody. And just because they are in fashion this year doesn't mean you should wear them unless they fit right, feel right, and suit your professional or personal lifestyle. 
<P>"The best elements of the clog are that they are roomy and stable. And the clogs with no back are particularly helpful to some who need to strengthen the foot because people grip with their toes," observes Glenn Pfeffer, MD, of the Orthoses and Footwear Committee of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society. "But," adds Dr. Pfeffer, "I'm concerned about the clogs that have no cushioning and the effect they can have on plantar fasciitis (heel pain), tendinitis, and other problems. On the other hand, if you're comfortable with a clog, run with it--or rather, stand with it."
<P>Even Dr. Hall concedes, "While I'm saying I'm crazy about clogs, they are not for everyone. I have some I can't wear. If you can get a comfortable fit, they are great." 

<H2>Can We Walk?</H2>
Clogs are for extended standing. But more and more shoe manufacturers are offering "walking clogs," a term often indicating that a backstrap has been added to the design. Is it really safe to walk in a clog? A backless shoe of any kind invites ankle twists and instability in a wearer making sharp turns or walking briskly. A clog with a molded heel cup may offer enough stability for modest walking--in and out of rooms, or even a leisurely stroll around the block with one's toddler. But for brisk, sustained walking, clogs are not recommended. A tie-on, well-supporting walking shoe is a must. In short, clogs should not be the only shoe you wear, but they can be a healthy alternative to closed shoes, particularly for the standing professions. 
<P>If we have learned anything from the Comfort Shoe Revolution, it is that fit and function, not fashion, should dictate your footwear purchases. The plethora of styles available from many quality comfort footwear manufacturers means you can find the right shoe for you. If that happens to be a clog, in the year 1997, you are in luck.

<H2><A NAME="history">The History of Clogs</A></H2>
"Wooden footwear is found all over the world," explains Jonathan Wallford, curator of the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto, which holds an unrivaled collection of historical shoes. "Why? Because wood is cheap, plentiful, easy to carve, waterproof, and lasts for a long time," he explains. Testament to that is the high number of surviving clogs from the Middle Ages. Among Bata's oldest clogs are French sabots carved entirely of wood, often in a highly ornamental fashion. The traditional wooden Dutch shoe remains part of Dutch folk dress and folklore. Their soles, contoured to the foot's shape, apparently feel comfortable enough that the Dutch still like to wear them. 
<P>The historical clog that most resembles the modern rendition featured a large leather strap nailed to a wooden sole. It was actually intended as an overshoe, explains Wallford. Both European nobles and peasants wore such overshoes to protect their good shoes from snow and mud. 
<P>The clog's entry into American fashion occurred in the late 1930s when handcrafted clogs by designer Oscar Auested became popular with University of Oregon students and then spread to other college campuses. Clogs became enormously popular in the late 70s with the Baby Boomer generation, and their current resurgence is partly a revival of 70s fashion.

<H1>Pregnancy and
Biomechanics</H1>
<P><I>by by Susan Cooke Anastasi and Elizabeth Black</I>
</CENTER>

<HR>
How does pregnancy affect the lower extremities? Ask any pregnant woman and she'll count the ways. Feet and ankles swell and hurt, shoes don't seem to fit, legs ache. At night, excruciatingly painful "Charlie Horse" cramps rob you of uninterrupted sleep. As for walking ... well at some point, one waddles like a duck. Some days, just getting out of a chair can be daunting. Lower back pain is almost inevitable as your weight and center of gravity change. Towards the end of the pregnancy, every bone in the foot seems to radiate pain with each step. 
<P>And that's a normal pregnancy. 
<P>Biomechanical problems may become extreme during a problem pregnancy. Yet, despite the fact that half the population is so affected at some point in their lives, amazingly little is known about these "normal" symptoms and what causes them. Much of what doctors know comes from anecdotal evidence, and there are contradictory reports. In fact, a new back study seems to indicate that the treatment exercises most often prescribed for back problems during pregnancy may actually weaken the back and contribute to more pain. 
<P>Normally, your obstetrician advises you on how to deal with these symptoms during pregnancy. And part of the advice you are sure to receive is a reminder that all of this is transitory, something to get through--so grin and bear it. But certain lower extremity symptoms suggest something more than "normal," transitory discomfort and your doctor should be consulted. And for those more "normal" aches, pains, and strains, understanding biomechanical principles and following some simple advice can make pregnancy a lot easier on you feet, legs, and back.
<H2>Edema</H2>
About 60 to 70 percent of pregnant women experience some swelling of the ankles and lower legs due to fluid retention. The root cause is hormonal, much like the swelling and slight weight gain many women experience before the onset of their menstrual cycle. It becomes most bothersome in the later months and is usually most noticeable in the evening. The swelling may be gone in the morning after a good night's rest. It's important to understand that this fluid retention bears no relation to the amount of water taken in. Sodium intake, however, can be a factor and you should avoid salt. Most doctors agree that diuretics should not be prescribed since there is evidence that they interfere with placental exchange and may alter the levels of sodium, potassium, and other electrolytes in the maternal blood. Treatment is really some fairly simple old-fashioned advice: Get off your feet. "Swelling is the largest foot complaint I get, and my advice is to mainly keep the feet elevated above the hip," says Dawn Zimmer, MD, Clinical Assistant Professor, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Indiana University. 
<P>Edema should never be dismissed as "normal" without thorough investigation. If edema is more generalized, especially if it's in the face and accompanied by a rise in blood pressure, it may be an early symptom of preeclampsia, a very serious and potentially fatal disorder. If you have these symptoms, report them to your doctor immediately. Once preeclampsia has been ruled out, edema can be treated symptomatically. "Lie down on your side for the better part of two days, and the edema may well disappear altogether," says Michael J. Hughey, MD, Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Northwestern Medical School in Chicago. "After that, periodically resting in a reclining position will help relieve swelling. Prolonged bedrest, however, is not healthy," cautions Dr. Hughey. Instead, he tells his patients to alternate periods of activity with periods of rest, and that rest should not be necessarily lying down in bed. "Once in the morning, perhaps once in the afternoon, settle onto a couch, feet up, and relax for a half hour." 
<H2>Leg Cramps</H2>
Fluid retention and sluggish circulation may precipitate leg cramps, often occurring while you're lying down or sleeping. Experts disagree on the causes. Obstetricians generally cite lactic acid accumulation in the leg muscles, due to inadequate supply or faulty absorption of calcium, or to interference caused by increased amounts of phosphorus. Biomechanical experts often cite mechanical factors. But whether from mechanical, circulatory, dietary-based, or a combination of factors, the pain is acute. From the pregnant woman's point of view, the only relevant question is: how do I stop the cramp? Since cramps may be precipitated when the muscles are shortened, they can often be quickly stopped by pointing the toes sharply upward, thereby lengthening the calf muscles. Some physicians also suggest standing barefoot on a cold hard surface, such as a tiled bathroom floor, gently rubbing and kneading the affected muscle while flexing the foot upward. 
<P>While getting your feet up is the best advice, the whole range of circulatory problems due to fluid retention can also be eased by another old-fashioned remedy, too often overlooked because it is just so simple--support stockings. In fact, according to Dr. Hughey, wearing support stockings can be very helpful. Cheap ones will do just as well as more expensive ones. Dr. Hughey passes along this comfort tip to his patients: "Since the tummy panels can be uncomfortable, just cut out the panel altogether, or better yet, cut vertical slashes through the panel. It relieves pressure over the abdomen, but leaves the support intact where you really need it, in the lower legs. Pregnant women should never wear thigh highs or knee highs because they hamper circulation."

<H2>Joint Laxity</H2>
No other factor of pregnancy has more effect on the lower extremities than joint laxity, a normal phenomenon that is, unfortunately, often misunderstood. The production of certain hormones (progesterone and relaxin) causes cartilage and ligaments to soften. During labor, this is a welcome occurrence because these hormones loosen ligaments in the normally rigid pelvis to help the baby pass through the birth canal. That's the good news. The bad news is that the softening is not confined to the pelvis. These same hormones also indiscriminately affect all joints--ankles, hips, and knees, causing them to become unstable and prone to injury. Now add the extra weight of pregnancy, and the problem intensifies. 
<P>For women who rigorously exercised before pregnancy, joint and tissue laxity can pose serious problems. Let's say you're healthy, love to run, and work out strenuously. You may be encouraged by the popular literature of the '90s to maintain the same level of exercise during pregnancy. Then when you develop injuries to joints, you are mystified. Certain biological realities cannot be messed with. Your temporary joint laxity is unavoidable. You can, however, avoid sustaining injuries--due to a lack of knowledge--that could jeopardize your mobility for the rest of your life.
<P>During pregnancy, avoid activities that stress the joints, especially if you have had any trouble in the past. "If my runner patients won't quit, I urge them to back off in intensity," says Hughey. The best advice, according to Michelle Mottola, PhD, Associate Professor of Anatomy and Kinesiology and Director of the Exercise and Pregnancy Laboratory at the University of Western Ontario, is to switch to swimming, a stationary bicycle, or something else that supports body weight but still provides the benefit of a good aerobic workout.

<H2>Low Back Pain</H2> 
More than half of all pregnant women have back problems. Some obstetricians put that figure at 70 to 80 percent. Pregnancy affects the back in three ways. One, the softening of cartilage during pregnancy makes the spine less stable. Two, added weight puts pressure on a frame that is not used to carrying an additional 20, 30, 40-plus lbs. Three, and most important, your posture changes during pregnancy. As the pregnancy progresses, a woman's center of gravity shifts upward and forward. She begins to lean backward slightly to maintain her balance. This adjustment can become a major cause of low back pain during pregnancy. 
<P>The strength of your back before pregnancy often determines how well you'll weather the added strain to your back. Women in their first pregnancies fare better. Later pregnancies may be more troublesome because the ligaments of the back and pelvis become a little looser with each succeeding pregnancy.
<P>If you're experienceing low back pain, consult your doctor. Nothing should be assumed. For instance, a urinary tract infection may disguise itself as a back problem. "Careful diagnosis is necessary and pregnant women should definitely go through all the tests--blood and urine--to accurately assess the pain," says Mottola. 
<P>When it comes to treating low back pain in pregnant women, Mottola disagrees with some conventional advice. "Some practitioners recommend exercises to straighten out the lordotic curve. This curvature is natural, so perhaps the better thing to do is to emphasize proper posture, which would maintain the normal lordotic curve. What you don't want to do is accentuate that curve or make it worse. Nor do you want to diminish it completely," she says.
<P>Just what are the correct exercises for treating lower back pain in pregnant women? In some cases, the lengthening of the abdominals in the later stages of pregnancy reduces the woman's ability to prevent posterior pelvic tilt. Mottola says that while strengthening of the abdominal and hip extensors are effective in reducing posterior pelvic tilt, this should not be the sole focus of the exercises. "The goal of the exercises should be to improve overall strength, endurance, and control of the muscles attached to the spine and pelvis," she says. 
<P>The issue of excessive weight in pregnancy is a hot potato. For decades doctors handed out "proper" weight gain dicta to patients, but the reality is that for some women, it's normal to gain 20 lbs.; for others a 30- or 40-lb. gain is normal, and quite easily shed later. The more important factor is proper nutrition and overall health during pregnancy. But that weight gain does place greater strain on the lower extremity. The impact of that extra weight on the lower body is roughly 1 1/2 times greater than normal when walking, and up to 3-5 times normal impact when running. This translates into a 450-lb. blow to the lower body each time the foot hits the pavement, or about 1,000,000 lbs. per mile. To avoid the strains associated with weight gain, Luye Lui, President of Luye Aquafit of New York, advises a water exercise program. "When a woman is in chest-high water she weighs roughly 10 percent of her dry-land weight. This is an ideal situation because the water is supporting her skeletal system, allowing her to effectively exercise her muscles in a low-impact environment," says Lui.
<P>While Lui's programs target flexibility, joint range of motion, cardio-respiratory conditioning, and resistance training, many women come to her simply for the relief of everyday strains associated with the weight gain. "The water is so effective that, especially in their last trimester, many women come in saying they can't wait to just get in the water," says Lui.  She adds, "The properties of water naturally give a woman better posture, which can be a relief to pain associated with the lordotic curve."

<H2>Ergonomic Factors</H2>
Since so many pregnant women remain at their jobs until close to delivery date, workplace habits and environment should be considered: the kind of chair you sit in, the floor surfaces you stand on, and the shoes you wear. If your knees are lower than your hips in a sitting position, the pelvis may be forced into posterior tilt, which tends to increase the lordotic curve. Place a telephone book or low stool under your feet while sitting, or place a rolled-up towel under your knees so they are higher in relation to your hips. All of the conventional wisdom--proper bending, flexing at the hips rather than the spine, raised work surfaces, bending at the knees when picking up objects, holding objects close to the midline of the body--applies in triplicate during pregnancy.

<H2>Shoes, Shoes, Shoes</H2>
Maximum shock absorption is the key to selecting shoes for the pregnant woman. A good, shock absorbing orthotic can be extremely helpful during pregnancy. Some women may require a custom orthotic but many probably can benefit from the short-term efficacy of a prefabricated orthotic (see <A HREF="/stride/v1n4/underfoot.html">Underfoot</A>). Robert Stephens, PhD, Professor and Chairman of Anatomy and Director of Sports Medicine at the University of Health Sciences in Kansas City, Missouri, recommends gel-cushioned running shoes. While he urges women to maintain current levels of activity with their physician's permission, he cautions against activities that take a pounding on hard surfaces. "If you run, make sure it's on a soft surface." Many physicians recommend walking over running. 
<P>Almost all experts agree on one environmental factor. High-heeled shoes, which serve to exaggerate the lordotic curve, are downright dangerous. Yet, many pregnant women possess an almost inherent common sense when it comes to wearing comfortable footwear during pregnancy. "They generally don't want to wear heels," says Denise Freeman, DPM, of the College of Podiatric Medicine and Surgery at the University of Osteopathic Medicine in Des Moines, Iowa. "Instead," Freeman continues, "as weight distribution begins to shift, and as swelling sets in, women tend to opt for a lace-up shoe." Dr. Freeman suggests footwear along the lines of today's athletic shoes--plenty of support, cushioning, and a solid heel counter. If a heel is desired, she suggests it not exceed one inch. A wide heel base is also important. Even a low, but tiny, tapered heel can cause a woman's ankles to wobble as she walks. No sense adding wobble to waddle. Remember, your ankles and supporting ligaments are more vulnerable due to joint laxity.
<P>Lots of women insist their feet grow during pregnancy. Even after they have lost weight and are fitting back into their pre-pregnancy clothes, their shoes no longer fit. It's a fact that a woman's rib cage actually grows--she's taking in oxygen for two--and after pregnancy a tape measure will reveal an added inch around the rib cage. So is it also possible that the body accommodates to pregnancy by allowing the feet to grow? Shoe retailers report they see the proof parade in weekly. Their measurement will clearly indicate a length of one-half to one size larger.
<P>Yet the feet don't technically grow. What happens, explains Dr. Stephens, is the stress of extra body weight causes the arches to fall a bit, which has the effect of adding length to the foot. "Now this will happen over time anyway," Stephens says. It's all part of the normal wear and tear on the body as one ages. It's just that in pregnancy, it happens quickly." 
<P>Actually, it's the combination of extra weight, edema, and hormonally-induced tissue laxity that seems to make feet "grow." The effects of tissue laxity on the foot are two-fold: a broadened forefoot and an elongated foot. "Such tissue laxity," says Anthony S. Kidawa, DPM, a specialist in circulatory disorders at the Pennsylvania College of Podiatric Medicine, "particularly between the metatarsal joints, can cause the foot to splay. In the midtarsal area, the arch will often begin to relax or descend, leading to an elongated foot." Dr. Kidawa advocates the use of quality support hose as the first line of defense. "The hose will help contain fluid and prevent tissue expansion." Brad Naylor, DPM, of Stanford University, agrees that support hose will often do the trick. "Sometimes an increased shoe size is also advisable," he adds.
<P>Dr. Stephens advises approaching the whole issue with common sense and a dash of humor. Foot lengthening happens. And it's usually no more than an extra half size. It occurs in men too, just more gradually. Pregnancy can speed the realization that shoe "size" and fit can and does change over time. 
<H2>Fit and Comfortable</H2>
A woman's pre-pregnancy physical fitness level often determines how well she'll weather the added strains and stresses to the lower extremities. Being overweight before pregnancy, a touchy issue to be sure, is likely to greatly exacerbate problems of edema, joint weakness, back pain, or foot pain. If you embark on a program of weight loss, proper posture, and exercise prior to pregnancy, a whole array of biomechanical problems can be avoided or lessened considerably. 
<P>Now is the time for some old-fashioned common sense advice to have a chance to prove itself, be it periodically putting your feet up, wearing support stockings, investing in super shock-absorbing shoes or orthoses, or altering your exercise routine to be kind to your joints and feet. And the added benefit here is that much of what you learn about proper footcare, posture, exercise, and footwear can help you develop healthy habits for a lifetime.

When Brian Smith walked nearly two miles to a convention in searing Las Vegas heat, only his feet remained cool and dry. What's funny is that the same footwear he wore also keeps Sue Truhler's toes toasty at Minnesota ice hockey games. What could be so versatile? Only sheepskin. 
<P>If you surf or live in California, sheepskin footwear may be old news to you. Stars such as Pamela Anderson wear boots made by UGG and Country Leather to the beach. The rest of the country may be more familiar with sheepskin coats or seat covers, but it's just starting to discover sheepskin's remarkable all-year benefits for feet. 
<P>As legend has it, surfers living on a sheep ranch in Western Australia in the '60s first invented socks made of shearling: the hide and fine wool of a lamb. Sewn with the fleece on the inside, they quickly warmed feet after a dunking in the icy waves. The socks wore out fast, though, so surfers began adding makeshift linoleum soles. They called their creations "ugly boots," and then "ughs" for short. Continuing design upgrades soon made the boots <I>de rigeur</I> in the surfing community, and it didn't take long before they spread beyond it. Today nearly one in three Australians own sheepskin footwear, and "ugh" is a generic term found in the dictionary. 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/ushort.jpg" WIDTH=121 HEIGHT=135 ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>In America, UGG is a corporate brand and perhaps the highest profile sheepskin footwear company. But by all accounts, sheepskin has been a harder sell on these shores. "Australians understand the properties of sheepskin," says Brian Smith, an Australian surfer who founded UGG. According to the Australian Council of Wool Exporters, that's probably because sheep well outnumber people in Australia, which also supplies more than one-quarter of the world's wool. "Our culture is built around sheep, whereas America's is built around cattle," Smith continues. "It's been harder for Americans to conceptualize--they generally think sheepskin footwear is too warm and too delicate for outdoor wear." 
<P>To understand sheepskin's benefits, think for a moment about the source: sheep survive and thrive on mountain tops and deserts, in blazing heat or pouring rain. When you put on a sheepskin boot, it protects your feet the same way. Wool keeps your feet warm by trapping your body heat in air pockets between its fibers. The lanolin in wool moisturizes your skin and helps wick away perspiration: wool absorbs up to 30 percent of its weight in water before it feels damp. The breathability of sheepskin also keeps your feet from getting too warm--one maker calls it "nature's Gor-Tex." On top of all that, the soft, springy fleece lining, which shapes naturally to feet, feels luxurious and provides support. 
<P>Wonderful as these characteristics sound, wearers must shed old assumptions and habits to take advantage of them. And that, says Smith, has been the biggest educational challenge. For instance, experts say you shouldn't wear socks with your sheepskin footwear. Adding that extra layer hampers the natural temperature transfer between your skin and the wool. Smith ran into this problem at the 1994 Winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway. "I had to outfit all the athletes, and a lot of them said, 'That's crazy, I'm going to wear socks.'" Retailers say they tend to get the same response from customers. Another common problem has been coaxing people to wear sheepskin when it's <I>not</I> cold. People living in the Midwest or on the East Coast look forward to casting their winter boots aside. But Smith insists sheepskin boots are an all-year-round product. His company and others have promoted this idea by introducing sheepskin walking shoes and clogs. 
<P>While sheepskin slippers are common in the U.S., outdoor sheepskin footwear is such a young industry, one can find barely a handful of companies carrying it. The first to penetrate U.S. markets "surfed" in. Two surfers from Australia and one from California founded UGG, Country Leather, and Aussie Dogs. Each company initially found success with California surfers, slowly branching into other outdoor and sports markets and finally to the edges of the mainstream. All three companies produce their footwear in Australia and New Zealand. Acorn, one of the only major companies to manufacture in the United States, started making sheepskin slippers and even some boots in the early '70s, says Thomas McGraw, sales and marketing director for Acorn's sheepskin footwear division. But when the company's Polartec fleece line took off while the sheepskin didn't, Acorn quit making them until this year. Sheepskin footwear ranges from about $55 to $180. Look for it in outdoor stores, specialty sport shops, department stores, and other national chains.
<P>According to the major producers, sheepskin outerwear-footwear is a tough market to enter. It's expensive and requires knowledgeable makers committed to high quality. Still, they all expect the roughly $35 million industry to undergo tremendous growth, soon. "I definitely see it on the upswing," says Chris Watt, founder of Aussie Dogs. "We're getting too much interest. At the last trade show, I had 12 magazine interviews in two days. A couple of years ago we played cards."
<P>Retailers tend to agree. "I'd say over the last four years I've seen an increase in demand," says Barbara Lies, sales associate at Overland Outfitters in Chicago. Overland Outfitters makes sheepskin coats and socks and carries sheepskin footwear made by Acorn and Tru-Stitch Footwear, a large producer of unbranded high-end shaerling slippers often sold through catalogs such as L. L. Bean. "People have begun to get more knowledgeable and accustomed to having sheepskin around, and it's just getting more popular."
<P>That's certainly the case for hockey mom Sue Truhler of Stillwater, Minnesota, who says she wants another pair of boots.

<B>Country Leather.</B> Country Leather is a leather boot and shoe company that targets the surf market and other so-called "action sports." Founded by Australian surfer and leather-worker George Burcher in 1973 (Burcher still lives in Australia), the company opened its California distribution outlet in 1990. It claims to be the oldest company in the sheepskin-for-surfers market, but prefers to be known for its sports shoes.
<P>"We do sell to some mainstream accounts with sheepskin," said Marketing Manager Joanne Whitehead. "But we don't like to be labeled as a sheepskin company. It has been our aim to stay true to the [surf] industry and other action sports."

<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/uggtall.jpg" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=161 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>UGG.</B> In 1979, Brian Smith began importing UGG boots and selling them through surf shops. He quickly adopted a surefire marketing strategy: make UGGs the must-have product for "cool" kids. "In the early to mid-eighties I started advertising by sponsoring young professional surfers," Smith says. "That created a cool image for that crowd. Wearing UGGs said, 'I surf.'" Soon, of course, non-surfing kids also wanted to be cool. When moms looked for the coveted boots, they couldn't find them in shopping malls. That's when stores like Nordstrom and Kinney began calling Smith. 
<P>UGG has applied the same strategy to other markets, such as hockey. "Once [kids] accept the look, it'll take over because it's such a tremendous product," Smith says. "The moms buy them for the kids and once they realize how practical they are, they buy them for themselves and for Dad." In Minnesota, <CITE>Let's Play Hockey</CITE>, a publication and TV show, gives away a pair of UGGs to its Hockey Moms of the month. Doug Johnson, editor of Let's Play Hockey, says he and the mothers love the boots' fashion appeal and lightness. "In hockey the worst thing you can have is cold feet," Johnson says. "You can have the same warmth with a Sorel, but they weigh about 100 lbs. And who wants to go clogging around--say to a restaurant after the game--in Sorels?" 
<P>At the 1994 Winter Olympics, UGG landed a marketing coup when Champion Sportswear distributed UGG boots to the American athletes. Team doctors said the boots kept their feet warm and sweat-free. And by the end of the Games, Smith also had won his battle with athletes over the socks: "By the closing ceremonies, no one was wearing socks," he says. "They'd all figured it out for themselves." Smith says he expects another boot order in a year's time for the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan.
<P>UGG became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deckers Outdoor Corp. in August, 1995. Deckers Outdoor Corporation, PO Box 5022, Carpinteria, CA 93014-5022, (800) 433-2537.

<P><B>Aussie Dogs.</B> Taking virtually the same route as Smith, his competitor and friend, Chris Watt started importing sheepskin boots to surfers in Mexico as he was exporting surf clothes to Australia and New Zealand. He opened Aussie Dogs' U.S. distribution site in 1989. Watt, a California native, said he concentrated on improving the boot's style. "My strategy was quality and consistency, and dependable service," he says. "I'm the one who [first] put in the reinforced toe and heel. Until two or three years ago I wasn't comfortable with the design, but now it's there." 
<P>Watt's company quickly jumped from the surf and ski markets to mainstream targets. Now Aussie Dogs skips surfing trade shows and concentrates on outdoor and even country-western shows. Also, Aussie Dogs avoids using snow in its ads so it won't be niched as winter wear. Its clogs and walking shoes, he says, are selling well. A story in 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/auslip.jpg" WIDTH=183 HEIGHT=67 ALIGN=LEFT>
<CITE>Seventeen's</CITE> back to school issue spurred 1,500 calls the first day the issue hit. "We get Birkenstock crossover people--the type of people who like to feel good, comfortable, and casual," Watt says. "It leans toward younger women, which is a complete reversal from the surfer boys. Once they feel that pile between their toes, people are sold."
<P>Aussie Dogs, produced in Australia and New Zealand, offers a one-year warranty on its products and same-day or one-day delivery on reorders. Aussie dogs, 207 Calle De Los Molinos, San Clemente, CA 92672, (800) 359-7079.

<P><B>Acorn.</B> Acorn, founded in 1976 by David Quinn maintains factories in Lewiston and Hampden, Maine. The company is known for its Polartec socks and slippers. Polartec is a lightweight polyester material made with recycled plastic that keeps feet warm and dry.
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/acorn.jpg" WIDTH=170 HEIGHT=178 ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>In January, Acorn reintroduced a line of sheepskin boots, slippers, and clogs and hired Tom McGraw from UGG to oversee it. The Australian companies contend that Acorn and other American companies can't compete with them on quality: they say the U.S. can't offer the best quality Merino skins, and that Australian cutters and tanners have 20 years of expertise over their American counterparts. McGraw counters, however, that production in the states in fact ensures higher quality, and that Acorn can provide faster turnaround than its competitors.
<P>"One of our competitive edges is we've been around for 20 years, and we do all of our own cutting and sewing here," says McGraw. "There's a lot of great shearling in the states, that is tanned here or that we tan abroad. Also, we've passed along a lot of savings to consumers in not having to import finished goods." 
<P>Acorn is also examining the possibility of starting a therapeutic line of sheepskin footwear. Post-surgery patients have already gravitated to sheepskin footwear, as have people with diabetes and cold-sensitive feet, according to UGG, Acorn, and Aussie Dogs. 
<P>Acorn received the 1996 Governor's Award for Business Excellence.

<HR>
<P><B>Editors' Note:</B> <CITE>Stride's</CITE> editors tried out UGG, Aussie Dogs, and Acorn boots. Sara Aase walked in a short pair of UGG boots and a tall pair of Acorn Maine Terrain boots. Elizabeth Black trekked about in tall Aussie Dogs. Both went sockless and loved it. Unfortunately, it was too early for "deep-freeze" testing: perhaps we'll do follow-up results in the spring.

<H2>Care and Feeding</H2>

<B>Waterproofing:</B> Use a non-silicone water repellent on sheepskin for extra waterproofing and stain protection. Companies generally sell their own line at stores that carry their products.

<P><B>Washing:</B> The American Wool Council advises hand washing in warm water with a mild soap, rinsing twice, and squeezing water gently out of the boots. Do not "wring," as this will cause "felting." Boots may be put through a machine spin cycle, according to UGG, or in a dryer if it has a non-heat setting, according to the Council. Allow boots to finish air-drying in outdoor shade if possible. Avoid hot dryers and direct sunlight. Boots will shrink slightly but will stretch naturally again with wear.

<P><B>Stain removal:</B> UGG advises rubbing white chalk on a grease stain. Leave for a few minutes, then gently rub. Repeat a few times until the stain disappears. For stubborn stains, sandpaper may be lightly and carefully applied.

<HR>
Fitness has a way of sneaking up on the regular walker. When I first started walking I wasn't very concerned with my heart rate or muscle strength. I was interested in losing weight and feeling good. But little by little, I began to notice I was actually becoming physically fit. For the first 18 months of my walking program, my heart rate didn't increase very much until toward the end of my walk. But as I approached my second year of walking, I began to notice that I felt warm, even sweaty, after just 10 minutes out. I got that glorious sense of "shifting gears" that occurs when your heart rate speeds up and the resultant extra blood circulation gives you a fresh spurt of energy. Once I shift into that higher gear, walking becomes easier, even effortless, and I start looking for hills and staircases to increase the challenge.
<P>I also began to notice that my muscles were getting stronger. It was less of a problem to carry heavy grocery bags. My legs felt less tired, even after standing for hours doing surgery. And perhaps most exciting, when my husband and I went out for the evening, I became an inexhaustible dancer.
<P>For the first time in my life, I felt the wonderful sense of power that comes with feeling physically strong. When summertime rolled around, I found myself looking forward to playing tennis, a game I used to play with great reluctance.
<P>Another sign of how walking changed my life became evident when I took a trip to the Alaska wilderness that included numerous hikes in the Mount McKinley region. Many members of the tour group experienced extreme exhaustion and decided to sit out some of the more strenuous climbs. But to my amazement, I found myself at the head of the hiking group. I could keep up with tour guides who had trekked the same mountains on many occasions. And all from just four or five walking sessions, from 20 to 60 minutes each, a week! 
<P>I don't look like a physically powerful person and my friends were amazed at my stamina and lack of fatigue. I can remember sitting at the top of the mountain enjoying a light snack while other members of the group were still far below, huffing and puffing their way up. What a great feeling for a girl who had always been chosen last for school sports teams!
<P>After you have followed the Walk It Off! program for a length of time, you too will one day arrive at an awareness that you're in much better physical condition than you were when you started. If you are overweight and haven't exercised for years before you begin walking, it could take up to two years of walking to condition your muscles, ligaments, and tendons. But whether it happens quickly or slowly, your muscles will eventually respond to regular walking.
<P>Now that you've arrived at a state of "fitness," should you continue to increase the level of physical challenge? Or should you be content to maintain your gains?
<P>This is a very personal decision. As I mentioned in <A HREF="/stride/v1n2/walkoff.html">Part 1</A>, a minimal walking program of 20 to 60 minutes four or five times a week is probably all you need to maintain your health, weight, and good mental outlook. But once you're feeling your oats and enjoying the sense of physical power it's fun to experiment at least with adding additional challenges.

<H2>Hitting the Hills</H2>
If you live in a hilly area, climbing hills is a convenient way to extend your walking challenge. As your fitness level improves, you'll find that without getting out of breath you can conquer hills that once made you huff and puff. Hill climbing raises your walking heart rate about 10 to 50 beats per minute. It's an excellent heart conditioner and calorie burner.
<P>But whatever goes up must come down, and some people find that downhill walking results in knee pain. When you're going downhill, your heel hits the ground with greater force; and since the leg must be more extended at the knee, absorbing the shock of the heel strike can hurt the knee. (<A HREF="#hill">See Hill-walking Tips</A>) Good walking shoes can help you avoid pain. But if you have good walking shoes and still get knee pain from downhill walks, try adding a different form of exercise to your walking routine.
<H2>Weights and Packs</H2>
Carrying a backpack or hand weights as you walk is a good way to increase the fitness impact and burn more calories. Sports medicine specialists have experimented with increasing the aerobic effect of walking by having walkers add weights to the torso, ankles, wrist, or hands. This does result in an increased energy expenditure. But according to the <CITE>Journal of the American Medical Association</CITE>, there are potential complications. Systolic blood pressure is increased while exercising with extremity weights, and a number of ankle and wrist injuries have occurred.(In fact, you should avoid ankle weights altogether. See <A HREF="#weights">Tips for Using Weights Properly</A>.)
<P>You don't need weights to benefit from the exercise of walking, and you certainly shouldn't walk with weights if doing so makes the activity unpleasant for you. I also strongly advise that people with high blood pressure or cardiac or circulatory problems avoid using weights, which may hike blood pressure even higher. If you have had a back injury or joint problems, weights may exacerbate them by placing extra strains on these places and increasing the likelihood of further injury.
<P>If you have none of these problems, however, and have become an experienced, steady walker, adding weights may add some enjoyment to your program. I use weights at times when I have only 20 or 30 minutes to walk but I long for a strenuous workout. Weights increase the difficulty and therefore the aerobic benefit of walking, allowing you to pack more fitness benefit into shorter workouts.
<H2>Race Walking</H2>
I've seen this walking routine called by dozens of different names, including "striding," "aerobic," "race," "fitness," "power," "pace," "rhythmic," "health," and "exercise" walking. They all boil down to very similar routines with the same goal: to boost the pace of walking so that your heart rate is kept high during the workout, as it is during running or aerobic dance.
<P>Race walking is a competitive sport with a regulation walking style. It's that funny-looking, hip-twisting walking you see done at the Olympics. One of its benefits is that it burns more calories per mile than running at similar speeds, because the upper-body and arm movements expend extra energy. And one of the things I like best about race walking is that short people, like myself, not only can compete successfully, but actually dominate the sport. World-class race walkers cover a mile in less than six minutes and the marathon in less than 2:45.
<P>Women are finding that race walking is a sport they can compete in successfully. Although it has been an Olympic event since 1908, the 1992 summer Olympics was the first ever to feature a women's race walking event.
<P>There are only two official rules for race walking: One foot must be in contact with the ground at all times (otherwise you are running); and your leg must be completely straight as your body passes over it (this occurs naturally.)
<P>But there are different techniques that help you walk more quickly. If you think you might eventually want to enter competitions, take some lessons in technique. The Walker's Club of America and other groups offer courses. There are thousands of race walking competitions around the country and some are for beginners.
<P>The race walking I suggest is an easier version of the Olympic sport. It differs from the brisk walking of the Walk It Off! program in three ways: pace, heart rate (or aerobic effect), and posture.
<P>Race walking is generally done at over three miles an hour, or 12 to 20 minutes per mile. Brisk walking, on the other hand, can be as slow as two miles an hour. Competitive race walkers clock astounding speeds: contestants in a 50-kilometer (31-mile) race average seven minutes per mile. The fastest recorded mile was race-walked in under six minutes.
<P>Race walking is aerobic. It requires a sustained level of breathing and heart rate. Aerobic activities enable your cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) system to supply oxygen to your body's major muscle groups so you can sustain continuous physical activity. Other aerobic activities include running, swimming, skating, aerobic dancing, and bicycling. Stop-and-start activities, such as football, tennis, and weight lifting, are not aerobic.
<P>The major long-term benefit of aerobic exercise is an overall improvement in your cardiovascular system, which lowers the risk of high blood pressure and heart disease. To gain significant benefits from aerobic activity, you must do it regularly, from 20 to 60 minutes per session, three to five sessions a week.
<P>Posture during race walking also differs from brisk walking. Because their hips twist, race walkers look very strange to the uninitiated observer. But the differences from regular brisk walking are actually not as dramatic as they look. It's mostly in the use of the hips and arms. The benefits of race walking include trimming the buttocks and hips and firming the upper torso and arms.
<P>To begin race walking, practice the following techniques.
<P><B><I>Lengthen your stride.</I></B> To walk faster, you take longer strides, so that you take fewer steps per foot and cover the distance in less time. 
<P><B><I>Lead with your arms.</I></B> An exaggerated arm swing helps you walk faster, propelling your body along. It helps develop upper body muscles, and increases the overall body motion and difficulty of your walk, which burns more calories. You can accomplish this in one of two ways: You can swing your arms in very long arcs so that at the top of each arc your arm is almost at shoulder level and parallel to the ground, or you can bend your elbow at a 90-degree angle and move your arms in a "pumping" motion, with your hands held in loose fists. (Don't clench your fists; that increases the tension in your arms and causes you to hunch up your shoulders, adding an unnatural stiffness to your walking style.) The long arm swing is fine at the beginning, but as your pace increases you may find it awkward. Try to switch to the pumping technique, in which arms stay closer to the body.
<P><B><I>Walk the line.</I></B> Your feet should land along an imaginary center line that stretches out in front of you. In regular walking, your feet travel along two parallel lines, at the same distance from each other as the width between your feet when you're standing still. But in fitness walking, you bring each foot down directly in front of you so that it lands on the same line the other foot has just left. Because your legs must "swing" around to put your feet in this single line, your hips will pivot slightly, moving from back to front with the step of each corresponding leg. This exaggerated hip movement helps tone your muscles.
<P><B><I>Plant your feet.</I></B> Race walkers concentrate on "planting" their heels at about a 40 degree angle to the ground. The bottom of the foot and the leg should be at a 90-degree angle to each other. As the edge of your heel strikes, tilt your foot very slightly to the outside. Your shoe will become like a rocker, allowing a smooth, speedy transition from heel to toe.
<P><I><B>Push off.</B></I> To accelerate, you pull forward with one leg, pushing straight back with the other until the toe is off the ground. Then swing the other leg forward. This powerful thrusting motion speeds you forward.
<P><I><B>Swivel your hips.</I></B> The hips should be pushed forward as far as possible with each stride to increase the distance covered. This downward and forward extension gives the race walker that distinctive swivel-hipped gait. You might want to practice this component of race walking by attempting to take longer strides.
<P><I><B>Time your breathing.</B></I> Breathing should be deep, even, and rhythmic, keyed to your pace. For maximum speed, coordinate your breathing with your stride. Many race walkers prefer to inhale for two steps, then exhale for two.
<P>Check with your doctor before race walking, especially if you smoke, are over 45, are overweight, or have a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, or foot problems. If your first attempts at race walking leave you feeling breathless or with pain or pressure in your chest, neck, shoulders, or arms, you should see your doctor. He or she may want to give you a stress test to see how your body reacts to aerobic exercise.
<P>Warm-ups and cool-downs are important with any aerobic activity. Walk briskly first, then switch into race walking mode. And cool down by walking slowly until your heart rate returns to normal. Stopping suddenly will make your heart rate and blood pressure plummet, which is especially dangerous in older walkers.
<P>When you switch to race walking you may experience sore muscles because you're using different ones than you do in brisk walking. This muscle strain will lessen as you develop muscles in both the front and back of the legs and thighs. Remember to stretch before and after race walking to prevent injury and soreness.

<H2><A NAME="hill">Tips for Walking on Hilly Ground</A></H2>

<UL>1. Ease into hills by warming up first. Start by walking on level ground. Slow down as you begin climbing uphill, then gradually increase your pace while maintaining comfortable breathing.
<P>2. When going up, lean forward, into the hill, and swing your arms vigorously for extra power. When going down, lean back slightly and take short, slow steps to reduce the braking impact of each step.
<P>3. Cool down by walking on level ground at the end of your walk. To reduce achiness and muscle tightness, be sure to stretch when you get home.

<H2><A NAME="weights">Tips for Using Weights Properly</A></H2>

<UL>1. Don't weight yourself all over. Instead, choose one of several weight options, such as wrist weight, a weight vest, or a weighted belt. If you use a belt, make sure it rests loosely and comfortably on your hip, not tight around your waist.
<P>2. Do increase the amount of weight you carry very gradually. A general rule is to add no more than one pound per week.
<P>3. Don't allow the weight you carry to exceed 10 percent of your own body weight.
<P>4. Do consider a backpack or a "fanny pack." These not only increase the difficulty of your walk, but give you a convenient way to carry items you may want to take along, such as sunscreen, bug repellent, keys, money, maps, healthy snacks, and so on.
<P>5. Don't carry hand weights limply at your sides. To make them work for you, swing your arms to chest or shoulder level to intensify the impact. A recent study showed that when weights are swung vigorously, heart rate increases on an average of 25 beats per minute.
<P>6. Don't use ankle weights. They can throw off your center of gravity and put too much stress on the knee, causing injuries.

<P>Funny how one little gift can change the whole direction of your life. In Maurice Breton's case, it was a gift he didn't even want. Maurice Breton had been in the shoe business for 20 years, working his way up from stockboy to vice president of a department store, and later moving to an executive position with a major shoe store chain. Maurice had access to the best shoes around. His closet was filled with Gucci, Bally, and Cole Haan. 
<P>Then five years ago, a rep from a Danish shoe company gave him a pair of shoes to try. Maurice was unimpressed. They were not very attractive, and too casual for Maurice Breton's work style. It was a Thursday. But as a lark, he wore them for the rest of the day. Not bad. 
<P>The next day was "Casual Friday," so he wore the shoes to work. Not even aware of it, he kept them on to go out to dinner after work and then caught a late movie with his wife. "I realized I had worn these same shoes from 6 a.m. to midnight without ever kicking them off," recounts Maurice. And then it was the weekend. He wore the shoes Saturday, then Sunday.
<P>"I'd always had lower back problems," said Maurice. "But I didn't feel the need to wear my back brace that whole weekend. I didn't understand why. I understand now. Something called shock absorption. All I knew was I didn't want to take those shoes off my feet. Funny how I could have been in the shoe business all my life and never have known what a shoe is supposed to feel like." 
<P>That was Breton's introduction to European comfort shoes. Hooked, he began investigating the European Comfort brands becoming available to the American market. The company he worked for, however, didn't share his excitement.
<P>So Maurice did something bold--something that could prove either brilliant or foolhardy. Breton quit his job. He sold his house in Virginia Beach and moved his family to the Washington D.C. area, a city picked because it represented just the demographic he was searching for. He rented an enormously expensive sliver of a shop--750 sq. ft.--in Alexandria, Virginia's Old Town on a historic street of trendy boutiques, restaurants, and art galleries, and opened the first Comfort Zone, selling nothing but European comfort shoes.
<P>There was lots of foot traffic on King Street, both tourists and the locals who lived in the 18th century restored townhouses lining Old Town's narrow cobblestone streets. Curious people walked into the shop. Except for Birkenstock, they had never heard of these European shoes--shoes with names like Ecco, Siebel, Mephisto, Haflinger, Dansko, Romika, Rieker, and Arche. Every customer was a difficult sell. "But I knew if I could just get them to take off their shoes and try on a comfort shoe, I'd have 'em." 
<P>That's when Breton knew that the Comfort Zone concept was going to be successful. "I got my first repeat business within a week. The word of mouth was awesome. I sold a pair of shoes to one woman. She said she would send her neighbor in. Three hours later in came her neighbor to buy a pair. Then this neighbor sent in her husband. And on and on." In a couple of day's time, Breton had sold six or seven pairs of shoes to friends of the first woman--he still remembers her name. Just as it had been for him and countless other comfort converts, once customers walked a day in true comfort, they couldn't go back to shoes-as-usual.
<P>Now, five years later, there are six Comfort Zones in the Washington D.C. area and one in Philadelphia, where a lot of his customers were driving in from. Of the six stores in the nation's Capital, two of the most successful are located across the street from each other, on Connecticut Avenue. (More on that later.) That first Old Town Alexandria Comfort Zone is now 3,000 sq. ft., packed with Clarks and Ecco, Naot and Beautifeel, Birkenstock and Arche, Zeeta and Portania, Rott and Romika. There are clogs and sandals, lace-up walking shoes and dress pumps, boots and slippers, socks and leather handbags. But where are the American shoes? 
<P>Breton serves up only European fare. Why? Are American shoes not up to his standards? "The best of them are Buicks," shrugs Maurice. "I'm about selling BMWs, Mercedes Benz, an Infiniti or two--no Ferrari's, mind you-- but maybe a Lexus. But I just don't sell Buicks or Chevrolets."
<P>The problem with American shoes is not quality of materials, per se, but rather the fit, he explains. "American shoe manufacturers fit to the ball of the foot. Europeans fit to the instep. They leave plenty of room for the toes to wiggle. You should be able to play the piano with your toes! An American shoe has a preconceived shape of its own to which the foot is expected to conform. The Europeans start with the unencumbered foot and build a shoe to fit around it."
<P>Maurice endlessly trains his staff on proper fitting technique, the comfort features, shock absorption, arch support, and foot anatomy. A podiatrist is on hand in the Alexandria store three days each week to help customers with special problems. Breton carries shoes with removable insoles so doctor-prescribed orthotics can be easily added.
<P>Comfort Zone staffers learn that a lot of time, effort, and education go into making the first sale to a customer. "But once they've bought one pair you never have to sell them again," emphasizes Breton. "The repeat customer is butter in a frying pan. They'll come in to try another style or experiment with another brand. They know what they want, often buying four or five pair at a time." 
<P>Shoes in the Comfort Zone are expensive. They range from $80 to $300, with the average women's shoe costing $100 to $120, and the men's shoe $140 to $160. And there is no such thing as a sale. While customers may initially be resistant to a $120 price tag on a pair of comfort shoes, they seldom complain or even ask about the price on their next pair of shoes. Once you walk in comfort, you know it's worth every dollar. 
<P>"It's more than style or comfort we're selling. It's health," asserts Breton. In true comfort shoe evangelistic style, he continues, "Do you know that the number one reason for bunions in women is bad shoes?" 
<P>Maurice Breton's wife, Debra, a former buyer for Macy's, is now part of the growing Comfort Zone business. But she wasn't always, he remembers with a smile. "In the beginning she thought I was crazy. She used to shoo me off to work in the morning by saying, 'Why don't you go off and play with your elephant shoes.' She doesn't call them elephant shoes any more." Debra's current favorite comfort brands are Zeeta and Arche.
<H2>Tale of Two Sides</H2>
Now about those two Comfort Zones on the 1600 block of Connecticut Avenue: the customers of each store don't know the other one exists. They serve two distinct, never-the-twain-shall-meet worlds. You have to understand the 1600 block of Connecticut Avenue. Maurice thought about it a long time. And he understands. 
<P>First a little anatomy. Connecticut Avenue at that location divides into two outer street level lanes and two inside fast lanes that dip into an underpass to allow traffic whizzing off to points north to pass under the notorious Dupont Circle, one of those British-inspired traffic circles that confounds motorists from anywhere but London. 
<P>Connecticut Avenue's curious division of lanes creates a street difficult to cross and helps create two very different cultures on either side of the street. On the west side is a store catering to the business person, with lots of comfort dress shoes and all the usual casual styles. There is an elegant, perhaps even "staid" feel to the store. This Zone is roomy and quiet.
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/shoe5.jpg" WIDTH=243 HEIGHT=201 ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>Cross over to the east side, if you can do so without being hit by traffic. Whoa! Zone into this Comfort Zone! Walls are black and white. Very sophisticated, very urban. Very, well ... alternative. Tall, black wood unisex sculputres hold trays of shoes. Not just any shoes. Never mind Volvos or BMWs--these are Humvees: there are Blundstone workboots from Australia and Dr. Martens (Doc's). Yes, they're trendy, but they're also solid, with roomy toe boxes, shock absorption, and traction to spare. A lot of black. A lot of ankle-high boots. A lot of weird buckles. But the shoes are still shaped for real feet and feature sturdy soles. This is a comfort zone for GenerationX, for sophisticated urban dwellers who demand cutting- edge style. You've never heard of these brands. But they're still health food for the feet, no less than the shoes across the street. And many of the styles are, in fact, identical to the ones across the street. But somehow in this setting they assume a different attitude.
<P>"We wondered whether the new funky store would pull customers from across the street," admits Breton. "But in those opening few months, the older store doubled in sales. And the new store attracted locals who had never noticed the Comfort Zone on the other side and still haven't. There are tremendous inventory advantages. Sometimes we're out of a size in one store and the sales clerk says, 'Wait a minute, let me check in the back,' then he dashes across the street and returns in two minutes with the right pair."
<P>Instead of each Comfort Zone looking like a franchise clone, each of Breton's seven Comfort Zones looks entirely different from the next. The logos aren't even the same. Each store reflects the mood and feel of the neighborhood in which it resides. And each store keeps track of its customers, sending personalized letters. "Mrs. Jones, we know how you love your Romikas. We just wanted you to know that the fall line arrives next week. You might be interested in the new clog they're introducing."
<P>Are there more Zones in the future? Undoubtedly. Maurice is always on the lookout for that special neighborhood--one with good foot traffic and plenty of upscale residents who relish quality, whether in healthful, fresh food, reliable cars, or comfortable, well-built shoes. 
<H2>The Coming Boom</H2>
What does Breton see as the future for comfort shoes? A tremendous boom. And not just because the baby boomers are aging and becoming more interested in comfort than style. "You know it's not really the Europeans, but Reebok that's responsible for the comfort casual shoe revolution," says Breton. "See, in America, Reebok and imitators made athletic shoes popular for casual wear. And lots of Americans started spending their leisure hours in shoes with shock-absorbing soles, roomy toeboxes, arch support, and shapes that conformed to their feet. Then they started wanting the same good feel when they went to work. Europeans, on the other hand, never went for the athletic shoe look. They didn't need to. They had comfortable, anatomically-designed, casual footwear from the start."
<P>"And now, think of our children, the next generation," Maurice continues with excitement. "These kids have never walked in uncomfortable shoes. They've worn roomy, cushy athletic shoes to school every day; comfortable, molded sandals to the beach; Doc's to parties; hiking boots to college classes. They've never really had to wear dress shoes. Now when they get out of college and have to show up at their first jobs, do you think they're going to want to squeeze their feet into uncomfortable, toe-constricting dress shoes?"
<P>A whole generation is going to be looking for comfortable shoes, and Maurice Breton and his Comfort Zones are getting ready.

<H1>Surviving
(and Enjoying) the Orlando Shuffle</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Sooner or later you'll be tempted by or scheduled for Orlando. Get ready to cover large distances very, very slowly.</B></FONT>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>

<HR>
<P>In 1996, a record 38 million tourists, businesspeople, and retirees will take a plane, bus, car, or train to Florida's family fun capital. Years ago, the Disney Company moved heaven and swamp in mosquito-infested Kissimminee in central Florida to create Disney World. The labyrinth of fun and adventure that grew up around Disney World has become today's Orlando and has spilled over into Tampa to the west and Cape Canaveral to the east. The area is unrivalled anywhere on the planet for thrills and diversion. The list is longer than a River Country water slide: Universal Studios, Sea World, Busch Gardens, Kennedy Space Center, and literally dozens of other theme and themeless parks, museums, and attractions make it humanly impossible to experience all Orlando has to offer on any a single trip or even several trips. Feeding the whole visitor stream is an elaborate convention and meeting trade that makes Orlando a must business or organizational destination for hundreds of associations, industries, and companies. 
<P>Sooner or later, you'll be tempted by the attractions, dragged by your kids, or scheduled by your association or business into the humid environs of Orlando. We know some business executives who must attend conventions in Orlando as often as twice in a month. Like it or not, you're going to go there. So why not like it? There's a lot to like, especially if you're prepared for and can survive the Orlando Shuffle.
<P>The Orlando Shuffle is an indigenous movement created at the theme parks where there's a line for just about everything. Want to see <CITE>Ghostbusters</CITE> at Universal Studios? Expect 60 to 90 minutes in a crowded and slow-moving snakeline. Want to zip down the water slide at Wet 'n Wild? Expect 20-30 minute stalls on the tower steps. Want to see Shamu jump through hoops? You could be shifting weight in line for an hour. The price of a few thrilling minutes means boredom on your feet for hours, often in the hot, humid Orlando sunshine. By the time you get back to the hotel, you'll be exhausted, a candidate for dehydration and heat stroke. Your feet, legs, and back will ache for hours--and you'll wonder whether it's worth it to have fun this way.
<P>Well, actually it is worth it because if you don't, you'll never know what you missed. But first, if you're going to visit Orlando, do it right. It's easy to stay cheaply in Orlando. Cheaply is not comfortably. There is so much that's tawdry and plastic in Orlando, a hotel refuge can make all the difference. You'll need all the amenities you can find to relax from having a good time in the wilds of Orlando's Attractionland. We recommend The Peabody Orlando, arguably the best hotel in Orlando. Known for its famous ducks parading daily through the lobby, the Peabody is elegant, not really all that expensive, and offers the first class extras you'll need to survive, such as a fully equipped health club, exquisite pool, and wonderful restaurants.
<P>Recently named to <CITE>Fitness Magazine's</CITE> 10 Best Hotels for Fit Business Travelers, the Peabody Athletic Club operates the only Nautilus Certified Training Center in Florida. Its 17 Nautilus stations are augmented by sauna, steam rooms, and jacuzzi. The outdoor pool, right next door, offers nearly Olympic dimensions, with lap lanes, a kid's pool, a king size whirlpool, and snack and drink service. The hotel also offers a map of four walking and jogging routes just outside. Guests are advised to avoid the intense heat by hitting the pavement either at daybreak or at dusk. 
<P>The Peabody also represents a gastronomical oasis in the middle of a fast food and chain food desert. Most major parks maintain one or two snack or deli menus disguised in numberless eatery themes: call it a Western burger, a Martian burger, or a desert burger--it's still a burger. Beyond the park perimeters are endless chains of high calorie, deep fried, Bennigans-style or Texas Pete operations. Avoid them all.
<P>All Peabody dining and snack facilities are first rate. That includes room service, which may be one of your best bets. But for a special experience, we recommend Capriccio, a restaurant we periodically monitor and can honestly call one of the finest restaurants in America. Certainly, it's the finest restaurant in Orlando (see <A HREF="#hotel">Hotels &#38; Restaurants</A>). 
<P>Fortified by food and lodging par excellence, you are ready to hit the great indoors of Orlando. In a word, prioritize. You can't see 12 parks in one or two days, or even three or four. The thrills will become monotonous after a while anyway. So pick your parks carefully and then pick the selected attractions within the park so you have a real agenda. If you are Disneyed-out, we recommend Universal Studios. Universal's movie rides and attractions are pushing the theme park envelope with new exciting, entertainment technologies as up to date as <CITE>Terminator II</CITE> (now open) and <CITE>Jurassic Park</CITE> (coming soon). You'll literally be able to return to Universal year after year because they keep adding megamillion dollar attractions.
<P>A day at Universal should start in the morning when it's cool. Be realistic, especially if you have added a one or two day adjacency to your business trip. You can't do it all. Target four or five rides. Allow a one-hour investment of time per ride. During non-school days, go to the most popular attractions early before the crowd rush and the least popular or the older rides midday and afternoon as the throngs descend. Then return to the most popular rides after 4 p.m. when many of the kids have gone home.
<P>My personal entertainment biases mapped out a one-day outing at Universal that started with <CITE>E.T.--the Extraterrestrial</CITE>. This is a good starting choice if you have a kid with you; another is Nickelodeon (see <A HREF="#nick">Nickelodeon</A>). <CITE>E.T.</CITE> is a joy and has the best designed "pre-show" and snakeline in the park. The ride's enchanted bicycle whisks you away from pursuing authorities, past the full blazing moon, just as it did in the movie, and then finally beyond the movie to the <CITE>ET</CITE> home world.
<P>Then try <CITE>King Kong</CITE>. Its New York subway preshow makes the waiting time pass quickly. Marvel at the endless graffiti on the walls, all of which is total gibberish. The tram through Kong-terrorized Manhattan is hot--the flames come quite close.
<P>In the late afternoon, be sure to seek out the Blues Brothers live show, held daily at an unmarked street location around the corner from Kong. Then scoot over to Earthquake and embark upon a very realistic subway ride on San Francisco's BART. You'll encounter street cave-ins, in-your-face
floods and explosions. For full singe, sit on the outside of the subway car.
<P><CITE>Terminator II</CITE> is the newest attraction. It's an awesome spectacle of video tape, live stage action, and special theater effects that will rock your senses and your seat. This is not a passive show. Nor is it a show for kids younger than teen-age. Expect live violence and terrorism of the sort alternative drama types used to call guerilla theatre. Highly recommended but only as non-family fare.
<P>At night, plan on seeing some of the fireworks displays. About 6:30 pm is a good time to hit <CITE>Back to the Future</CITE>, when the waiting time is only about 20 minutes. It's not highly recommended--for many it's probably too dizzying and jarring. 
<P>Prepare for some disappointments. Not all the kinks have been worked out of the highly computerized and automated rides. A few months ago when we visited, the new <CITE>Terminator II</CITE> supershow was shut down for well over an hour as hundreds of people waited in a crammed snakeline.
<P>And that's the point. Whether it's Universal, or any other major park, expect to be standing on your feet without support for long periods of time--perhaps more than 90 minutes--as you move slowly through a snakeline. This will tax your feet, joints, and back, especially as you stand, shift, and slump in line. To survive, you'll need to dress comfortably, keep liquids on hand, and do small things to maintain good circulation and posture (see <A HREF="#doc">An Orlando Doctor's Advice</A>).
<P>Yes, it is possible to return from Orlando without saying "I need a vacation." You may even say, "Gee, I wanna come back." Then you can do everything you missed the last time. Or at least some of it.

<P><B>The Peabody Orlando</B>
<BR>9801 International Drive,
<BR>Orlando, Florida 32819; (407) 352-4000
<P>The best hotel in Orlando has all the amenities, comforts, and health orientation you need to survive the Orlando Shuffle--and feel good. Light meals or lunches at the Bee Line. Great lobby. Watch for parading ducks--a Peabody ritual. 
<P>
<P><B>Marriott World</B>
<BR>8701 World Center Drive,
<BR>Orlando, Florida 32821; (407) 239-4200
<P>If the Peabody is booked, or if you're a golfer, the Marriott World is your best bet. Spacious rooms, excellent restaurants, dynamic health club, and of course an 18-hole course.

<P><B>Capriccio</B>
<BR>(at The Peabody Hotel)
<BR>9801 International Drive,
<BR>Orlando, Florida 32819; (407) 345-4450
<P>Service, lively surroundings, fiery grill chefs, sumptuous and innovative light cuisine combine with a special Florida joie de vivre to make Capriccio both the best restaurant in Orlando and one of the best in the nation. Favorite appetizers include sauteed mushrooms over asagio polenta and an eggplant dish baked in a wood burning oven. Favorite entrees include a heart-conquering capellini with shrimp, artichokes, and sun-dried tomatoes, as well as mesquite grilled mahi-mahi or salmon. Desserts? Don't ask! Yes, it's okay to eat there twice in one trip.

<P><B>Christini's</B>
<BR>7600 Doctor Phillips Blvd.,
<BR>Orlando, Florida 32819; (407) 345-8770

<P><B>Marrakesh and Akershus</B>
<BR>(at Disney's EPCOT Center)
<P>Two of the most delightful restaurants in Orlando are maintained with the support of the Swedish and Moroccan governments as cultural showcases in EPCOT Center. The food is exquisite at either, and staffed by volunteers from the Moroccan and Swedish governments. Akershus offers a buffet of several dozen Swedish creamed and marinated salads, each one more tantalizing than the other. Marrakesh proffers the full Moroccan treatment, from pillow seating to ritual washing of hands to Arabian delicacies. Expect a long wait for Marrakesh. Access only by purchasing admission to EPCOT.

<P><I>by Robert Palumbo, MD</I>
<P>To survive long, slow moving lines that keep you shuffling for hours at a time, wear the most comfortable clothes you own. And wear comfortable footwear: cross-trainers or superb comfort shoes with a highly-cushioned, shock absorbing insole and built-in support. Never just stand still in line. Simple exercising will combat fatigue and keep up circulation. Such exercises include rocking, doing calf raises, and isometric exercises such as abdominal tightening. Don't be afraid to do regular stretching or even deep knee bends while waiting. Find the most comfortable position for your pelvis while standing to relieve strain on your back. Don't carry too much to the park, especially when you have kids. Use strollers. 
<P>Drink plenty of water regularly, thirsty or not, especially before entering a line. Try to eat light at the restaurants and snack bars. Plan to enter a sit-down restaurant during the noon hour, the hottest part of the day. Take your time. Then plan some leisurely shopping during the early afternoon before you return to the rides, but just scout.  Purchase your gifts at the end to prevent carrying packages around all day.

<H2>Cultural Orlando</H2>
<P>Without a doubt, Orlando is a theme park town. But that's not all there is. Long overshadowed by glitz, Orlando's major arts and culture entities have banded together to form the nation's first-ever "cultural chamber," a combination of private enterprise and public institutions know as OPAAC (Orlando Peabody Alliance for the Arts and Culture).
<P>"While corporate and individual travelers to Orlando love our theme parks, lately more and more of them are asking for new and different activities. Our mission is to reverse the perception of Orlando as a destination only for theme parks, and elevate Orlando's cultural tourism to its rightful place in our city's tourism product mix," observes Alan C. Villaverde, General Manager of The Peabody Orlando, which spearheaded OPAAC. Members of OPAAC include: Civic Theatres, Southern Ballet Theatre, Orlando Opera Company, Orlando Philharmonic, Enzian Theater, Orlando-UCF Shakespeare Festival, Cornell Fine Arts Museum, Orlando Museum of Art, Orlando Science Center, Maitland Art Center, Crealde School of Art, and The Peabody Orlando.
<P>For information on Orlando's ongoing cultural schedule, once you're in Orlando, contact (407) 363-5871.

<H2><A NAME="nick">Nickelodeon</A></H2>
<P><I>by Rachel Black, 12 years old</I>
<P>If you or your kids are Nickelodeon fans, Nickelodeon Studios should be your first stop in Orlando. Nickelodeon is a wacky, wild, colorful, and fun place. There's something for everyone--whether your interests include <I>Gullah Gullah Island</I>, a cheerful program full of morals for kids from the ages of two to six, or <I>Kenan and Kel</I>, a sitcom about two teenage friends and their wacky experiences. Or maybe you have an older kid who enjoys <I>Nick-at-Nite</I>,  programming that plays rerun sitcoms from the 1950s to the 1970s, or <I>Nick-at-Nite's "TV Land,"</I> a whole new spin-off channel that includes sitcoms from <I>Nick-at-Nite</I> as well as dramatic series.
<P>First of all, you and your kids will learn just exactly where and how their favorite Nickelodeon shows are produced--an experience they'll never forget. Although behind glass, you will be exposed to the rooms where videotapes are stored, control rooms,  and even the actual sets themselves--which for me personally was the highlight of the tour. Now every time I watch <I>Kenan and Kel</I>, I think to myself, "I was there, I saw that set--up close." 
<P>Following the tour, everyone is taken into The Game Lab for contests. Some involve the whole audience and others just include selected kids. The hosts are a joy to be with--very energetic and ready to have fun. But to prove Nickelodeon's kid spirit, as a Grand Finale, someone from the audience gets the honor of being totally and completely slimed! Will it be you?

<H1>Your I.Q. is Showing</H1>
<P><I>by Elizabeth Black</I>
</CENTER>

<P>In the last issue, we asked you to dig into your closets and give us your shoe I.Q. (Imelda Quotient). It was a long and detailed survey, as surveys go, asking you to estimate the number of shoes you own and how many you wear regularly, to describe your shoe buying habits and many other details. I decided it was only fair I fill out the questionnaire myself. I'm embarrassed to admit I gave up halfway through, discovering it was easier to write the questions than to answer them.
<P>But our readers responded with amazing detail and perseverance. Hundreds of surveys poured in, keeping our fax machine buzzing. So many readers are hungry and grateful for information about healthy feet and comfortable shoes. Our Minneapolis office is compiling the information and we'll report the results in the next issue [Spring 1997]. But since thousands of  new readers join us with each issue, we are rerunning the survey to allow more recent readers to participate. So if you did not complete the survey last issue, or if you are a new reader seeing <CITE>Stride</CITE> for the first time, please take the time to answer the questions found on page 27. If you include your name, you will be eligible for the drawing of a hanging shoe bag closet organizer.
<P>If you are a new reader, we encourage you to request back issues on your subscription because each of our four issues builds off information in the last, adding to our mutual understanding of how the health of our feet, the fit of our shoes, and the fitness of our lower body contributes to our overall health and well-being. If we are out of a back issue you are requesting, you can access the magazine at the Stride Gateway at www.stridemag.com/stride.
<P>We trust you'll find this issue packed with useful information--comfortable clogs to liven your step; sheepskin to warm (and cool) your toes; socks with technological savvy; tips to make pregnancy easier on feet, legs, and back; footwear guidelines for diabetics; new challenges for advanced walkers; and much more.
<P>On a personal note, my introduction to <A HREF="/stride/v1n4/sheepskin.html">sheepskin</A> is among my fondest memories. While Edwin was on a dangerous undercover operation on an island off the coast of Australia for the Chicago Tribune in 1977, I drove 600 miles alone into the Australian outback to spend two weeks with a family on a remote sheep station. (The drive was a challenge because I had to dodge hundreds of huge kangaroos that ran along beside me or hopped onto the roadway, daring me to hit them.) That was before life on a sheep station was romanticized by the bestselling novel, <CITE>The Thorn Birds</CITE>. The outback station's entire existence depended upon sheep. Every meal was mutton, and the carpeting was all wool produced on the station. My bedroom was covered in sheepskin rugs. Waking up in the morning and sinking my bare feet into those lush rugs was heavenly. So it took little convincing from Brian Smith, the surfer from Australia who brought Ugg sheepskin boots to America, to try on a pair. What a feeling. Sara Aase investigated further to determine why sheepskin is so good for your feet.
<P>As <CITE>Stride</CITE> closes its first year, some thanks are in order. First, we thank the extraordinary group of comfort shoe stores that have joined the <CITE>Stride</CITE> movement, making <CITE>Stride</CITE> available to their customers. Most of their names can be found in <A HREF="/stride/storelist.html"><CITE>Stride's Guide to Comfort Shoes</CITE></A>. The list is by no means complete because new stores join the ranks each day. These stores are making a daily contribution to the biomechanical health of America. One of them, <A HREF="/stride/v1n4/profile.html">The Comfort Zone</A>, is profiled this month. Their story is an inspiration. 
<P><CITE>Stride</CITE> is also distributed in thousands of biomechanics practitioners' offices across the country--orthopedic surgeons, podiatrists, physical therapists, pedorthists, and other members of the biomechanics mainstream. We thank them for reaching out to you, their patients, with this magazine. Many of these same doctors--far more than just those listed on our Board of Editorial Advisors--scrutinize <CITE>Stride</CITE> manuscripts to make sure all medical and technical information is the best, up-to-date, and most accurate available. These expert readers--drawn from our contacts for <CITE>BioMechanics Magazine</CITE>--take precious time from their busy schedules to do so. 
<P>Please write, fax, or email your responses, questions, and suggestions. We exist for you and because of you. Edwin and I extend our wishes for a blessed and healthy holiday season and a Happy New Year.

<H1>Running Start</H1>
</CENTER>

<H2>Prophylactic Bracing for MCL</H2>
An injury to your MCL--the medial collateral ligament--occurs when enough of your knee is twisted in a certain way. These injuries are often passed off as simple knee sprains; for example, when a skier catches her ski tip and the ski veers off to the side, according to Ronald P. Grelsamer, MD, chief of hip and knee reconstruction at J. Maimodes Medical Center in New York. Using a brace very early in the recovery process can significantly shorten the time it takes to return to athletic activity.
<P>But can braces actually prevent injury? Nothing would be better than to boldly venture forth in rigorous activity believing you are protected from an MCL injury. The concept, known as prophylactic bracing, is appealing but controversial. Dr. Grelsamer says study results are mixed. "The most recent study suggests a slightly lower injury rate in football players playing certain positions with prophylactic braces, but a higher injury rate has been reported for players at other positions," he says. He added that a West Point study yielded similar data.

<H2>The Sounds of Running</H2>
It came to him in a dream. James Sundquist, a composer, dreamed some years ago that he was scoring music to the sounds of running feet. People said he was crazy. Indeed, the idea was just crazy enough to pique the interest of Nike Corporation, which in 1985 gave Sundquist enough money and Air Odyssey shoes to begin recording the sounds of running. From there, Sundquist was able to determine the average paces of running at different fitness levels. He and others then composed music that exactly complements those paces. "We were able to record what you'd actually hear during natural biomechanical movement," Sundquist says. "It's a heel follow-through lift-off movement: a triple motion, like '<B>da</B>-da-da, <B>da</B>-da-da, <B>da</B>-da-da.'" he says. "We compared the wave forms (of the sounds) to those of pop music." There was a quite a difference. "Pop music has dramatic changes in amplitude and direction," he explains. "Our music actually followed the soft wave forms of human motion." 
<P>Over the years, Sundquist's company, The Medical &#38; Sports Music Institute of America, adapted its pacing capabilities to walking, race-walking, skiing, cycling and exercise "riding" machines. Music-in-Sync, Volume 1, now spans 64 different tempos and can be used for physical therapy, including aquatic therapy. Customers include the Veterans Administration, NordicTrack, and even NASA. 
<P>To order a tape or complete a health profile that will help determine your fitness level, contact the Medical &#38; Sports Music Institute of America, Inc., PO Box 1177, Bloomfield, NJ 07003-1177. (201) 429-1994. Email: virtfit@ix.netcom.com.

<H2>It's not EASY to find the SPA</H2>
Many women looking for comfortable dress shoes were delighted when Nine West created its SPA line of shoes. But now some of those same women can't find them. That's because Nine West purchased Easy Spirit last year, then decided to merge the Nine West Spa line with Easy Spirit's offerings, creating something called SPA Easy Spirit. As for style, fit, and comfort features, the SPA shoe remain the same as when they were called Nine West Spa. You'll still find separate Nine West and Easy Spirit stores in your local mall. But look for SPA Easy Spirit styles in Easy Spirit stores. Call 1-888-EASY-SPA.

<H2>FDA concerned about Internet</H2>
In a recent two-day conference, the Food and Drug Administration began examining its role in regulating medical information on the Internet. "FDA and the Internet: Advertising and Promotion of Medical Products," gathered medical industry heads, vendors, health professionals, and consumer groups in Silver Spring, Maryland, to discuss the issue.
<P>Current FDA regulations state that drugs can only be promoted for uses that have been demonstrated as safe and effective according to its standards. But the Internet's magical access to almost any information from anywhere has confused consumers and businesses alike. Consumer groups fear fraud or misleading promotions. Companies fear liability for off-label drug use promoted by third parties. Others fear regulation will hamper product and research advancement as well as patient awareness.
<P>Watch for more on this later. The Internet may be traveling at Warp speed, but this proposed regulation is moving in slow motion.

<H2>Do You Resemble Your Dog?</H2>
If you look like your dog, you could win a trip to Australia's Gold Coast. Aussie Dogs (makers of sheepskin boots) is sponsoring a dog/owner look-alike contest. Entry forms can be found at approximately 300 stores across the country carrying Aussie Dogs boots (see <A HREF="/stride/v1n4/sheepskin.html">Sheepskin</A>). Just fill out the form, include a picture of you and your dog and mail by December 31, 1996.

<H2>That's <I>Para-</I>lympic</H2>
We will all remember last summer's Olympic record-breakers. But few know that their disabled counterparts, competing in the Paralympic games in Atlanta a few weeks later, nearly matched some of those amazing times. Tony Volpentest, for example, an amputee running on artificial legs, finished the 100-meter dash at 11.36 seconds, just 1.5 seconds behind the able-bodied Olympic gold-medal winner Donovan Bailey. 
<P>Last summer's Paralympics was only the 10th, but already disabled athletes, with superior training, prosthetics, and committed sponsors, have attained world-class athletic status. Those who attended the Atlanta 96 games said the level of intensity they witnessed forever changed their perceptions of so-called disabled athletes. Unfortunately, the U.S. still promotes the Paralympics like a second-class citizen, and only 700,000 total spectators attended last summer's games--less than half of the audience in Barcelona four years ago, and a mere drop in the bucket compared to the whopping 8.6 million tickets sold for the Olympics. The 2000 Paralympics will be in Sydney, Australia.

<H1>Marketplace</H1>

<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/legs.jpg" WIDTH=251 HEIGHT=89>
</CENTER>
<P>Remember when buying socks was easy? No more. Technology has caught up with the sock industry and the choices out there are mind-boggling. Here are a few good socks for the winter days ahead.

<H2>Outdoor Socks</H2>
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/outdoor.jpg" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=115 ALIGN=LEFT>The problem with traditional outdoor socks is the cylinder knit process, says the Maine-based Acorn company. To make them warmer you have to increase the denier (yarn size), but then the openings between knit stitches get larger, resulting in heat loss. AcornSox2 uses Polartec fabric, which offers 360 strands of yarn versus the 60 of most outdoor cylinder-knit socks. This creates a dense, tight knit sock, fleeced on both sides, which holds in warmth through thousands of tiny air pockets. If this is more than you want to understand about yarn, just try a pair. They're warm and soft beyond belief. AcornSox2 come in various styles and colors. You'll find subdued solids and wild neon patterns with such names as Black firecracker and Alpine zipper. Call 1-800-US-ACORN.

<H2>Mix in Some Silk</H2>
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/silky.jpg" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=117 ALIGN=RIGHT>
Wigwam Mills of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, known for its CoolMax athletic performance socks, has combined its sports emphasis with feminine styling and colors for women's trouser socks this winter. Heather Stripe is a combination of cotton and silk. It looks like cotton, but feels like silk. This style as well as the all-cotton Tye Dye are perfect for sandals, clogs or any other time you want your socks to show. Call 1-800-558-7760.

<H2>Sealed Socks</H2>
NaturalSport has been granted the "Seal of Acceptance" from the American Podiatric Medical Association in recognition of the health benefits of its aerobic and rugged walking socks. "Few people know that 100 percent cotton socks are a leading cause of skin irritation in feet," says Pat Williams, NaturalSport's director of marketing. It's not a matter of how comfortable a sock feels wearing it before you walk. It's how the foot is protected during activity. And during high activity, cotton fibers can be abrasive to the skin. An active sock should keep the foot near normal body temperature and prevent abrasive conditions. NaturalSport's 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/sealed.jpg" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=94 ALIGN=LEFT>
fiber content is designed to do that. It's 70 percent Duraspun, a fiber that wicks moisture three times better than cotton, offers exceptional cushioning and thermal conductivity, and lasts 35 percent longer than cotton, according to the fiber's manufacturer, Monstanto. NaturalSport's blend is rounded out by 10 percent combed cotton, 10 percent stretch nylon, and 10 percent Lycra. This blend keeps feet dry, hugs the arch, provides extra cushioning under the heel and ball of the foot, conforms to the foot's shape without wrinkling or bunching up, and ensures softness next to the skin. Call 1-800-766-6465.

<H2>Going Hot and Cold</H2>
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/bwrap.jpg" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=69 ALIGN=RIGHT>
Tired of keeping track of both your heating pad and ice pack? Try the ThermoCel Hot/Cold Wrap--it provides both hot and cold therapy in one product. Pop it in the freezer and use it to treat sprains and strains; chronic, inflammatory conditions; headaches and muscle aches; toothaches; insect bites and minor burns. Heat it in the microwave and ThermoCel helps soothe sore, stiff muscles and joint and relieves the aches and pains of arthritis, back and neck aches, and muscle and menstrual cramps. The wrap is made of segmented, body-conforming thermo pillows, suspended in a non-toxic gel. The pillows are filled with purified water. ThermoCel is available as a multi-purpose knee/elbow wrap. Call (800) 541-7199.

<H2>More Than Just Galoshes</H2>
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/galoshes.jpg" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=172 ALIGN=LEFT>
Here's a new take on an old idea: the Neos Performance Overshoes are an updated version of those old-fashioned galoshes your mother made you wear in bad weather. Neos Performance Overshoes fit over your regular shoes and keep your feet warm and dry. An adjustable instep strap holds feet securely in place-whether you're wearing dress shoes or comfort sandals-and a draw string fits the overshoes snugly around your leg. A layer of socks, shoes, and Neos Performance Overshoes retains heat, keeping feet toasty warm without bulky boots or liners. The overshoes fold flat into their own nylon stuff sack, which makes them suitable for commuting or travel. Neos Performance Overshoes come in a variety of styles: Villager, Youth, and BackCountry, for those grueling winter climbs. Call (802) 425-4848.

<H2>Kneed-It Now</H2>
The KNEED-IT Kneeguard is a new device designed to ease chronic knee pain due to conditions such as tendinitis or arthritis. Developed by Donald 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n4/kneed.jpg" WIDTH=80 HEIGHT=116 ALIGN=RIGHT>
Fareed, MD, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in sports medicine, The KNEED-IT is a band worn snugly around the leg just below the kneecap. Its advanced compression plate design, based on 15 years of clinical observation, purportedly provides pain relief by absorbing shock adjacent to the kneecap and by exerting compression and warmth across the soft tissues in front of and behind the knee. It is available at sporting goods stores and pharmacies. KNEED-IT can be used in conjunction with taping or wrapping the knee. Consult with your doctor before using. Call (800) 676-1550.

<H1>Prefabricated Orthotics</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>You don't always
need a custom orthotic. Often a less expensive
prefabricated device will do.</B></FONT>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
</CENTER>
<HR>
You have pain in the foot, knee, or back from work, play, or perhaps just from growing older. Maybe you're diabetic or arthritic. Perhaps your body is off-kilter due to a limb length discrepancy or a foot deformity. An orthotic may be all or part of the answer to your problems. So which is better, a prefab orthotic or a custom? That's an impossible question to answer. It depends upon your individual medical needs and the assessment of your doctor or other biomechanics practitioner. You may as well ask which is better for a migraine, Advil or a prescription pain killer? But there are some important insights into prefabs that can help you understand when a prefab is right for you.
<P>First, understand we are speaking of medical grade prefabricated orthotics prescribed and modified by a licensed practitioner to treat a specific diagnosis. We are not referring to commercially available insoles you can buy in the drugstore (although there is a small group of highly molded and engineered drugstore insoles that are so well regarded by the medical community they are also dispensed by prescription: Spenco, Pedifix, and Implus are just a few.) Nor are we referring to comfort devices for the healthy foot. We are talking about medical treatment, which if handled correctly can remedy pain and correct gait--and if handled incorrectly can worsen your situation.
<P>If you need a custom orthotic, your practitioner will start by casting your foot. That is, he will create a three-dimensional impression of your foot, either with plaster, a foam box, or a hi-tech foot scanning device. Plaster yields an outline of your foot that resembles a slipper. The foam box yields a three-dimensional footprint. And a scanner creates a CAD-CAM computer image. Different practitioners have different casting preferences and they will debate forever which is more accurate.
<P>Once created, the impression of your foot will then be marked for modifications, such as wedges, protective layers and pads, heel cushioning, or cutouts, as they are required for your specific problem and body. The thickness will be selected according to your weight and the degree of foot control or protection required. All this detailed prescription information is attached to the cast and sent to an orthotic lab for fabrication (although labs complain that too often some information is missing). In some cases, the device is fabricated right in the office. Within days or sometimes weeks, the device will come back to the practitioner for fitting and perhaps further modification at a second visit. Depending upon the materials used, the complexity of the modifications, and the amount of  time devoted by the practitioner, a custom orthotic costs several hundred dollars. But when you walk out, you should have a device custom measured and adjusted precisely for your foot and ailment.
<P>Remember, every foot is different, every body form is different, and a custom orthotic must address your specific needs. Compare a custom orthotic to prescription eyeglasses. One size doesn't fit all.
<P>All the above said, the reality is that not all orthotic treatment requires a custom device with all the bother and cost that accompanies it. Many prefabs are approaching the efficacy of their custom counterparts. Some prefabricated devices are virtually the same as custom devices except they lack the initial casting step. Indeed, one California lab, KLM, offers a prefab version of all its custom models. Prefabs are unquestionably off-the-shelf and made for the masses. But they can be customized to incorporate all the modifications your practitioner requires. As a result, you usually get your orthotic for much less expense, often the same day your practitioner prescribes one--and without casting. 
<P>Until recent years, "prefabricated" was a dirty word in much of the orthotic community. Some five and 10 years ago, orthotic treatment at any level often involved all the mess, bother, delay, and cost of a full-blown custom. Certainly, years ago there was a thriving market for such pioneers as the Readyform and the Preform, but even doctors who used them often wouldn't admit it.
<P>Today, the field has exploded. Doctors are openly and enthusiastically using dozens of inexpensive medical grade prefabricated devices. They are stocked in a variety of sizes. Most are customizable. Some directly mold to the foot after water injection or a few moments in a toaster oven. Some are marketed by the same labs that also market custom devices. Many are so highly engineered, they blur the lines between prefabs and customs, causing enormous confusion among doctors themselves, not to mention health reimbursers. Indeed, <CITE>BioMechanics Magazine</CITE> is constantly airing the custom vs. prefab debate.
<P>The best candidates for a prefab are those who only require short-term orthotic intervention, such as a pregnant woman in need of extra shock absorption to relieve knee and back pain. Or perhaps your doctor wants to test the efficacy of orthotic therapy. He could start you with an inexpensive prefab before committing you to a more expensive, long-term custom device. You may also be a candidate for a prefab if your orthotic needs are slight. About a third of the doctors responding to a <CITE>BioMechanics Magazine</CITE> mini-survey on prefab use cited a temporary or trial effort as the reason they employ prefabs. 
<P>Your doctor may decide your condition is not severe or complex enough to justify the cost and effort of a custom device. For example, you may need better shock absorption at work or while running. Or perhaps you develop pain only when in dress heels. The point is, five and 10 years ago, for many doctors, even short-term orthotic treatment involved custom casting. Today, medical commerce has made this orthotic treatment simpler and more affordable.
<P>There is a common belief among practitioners that prefabs are mainly so-called accommodative devices; that is, they are soft, cushioning, and protective. That's because the least expensive orthotics to mass produce are in fact the softer ones. But now, manufacturers have introduced functional prefab devices made of various thicknesses of plastic or dense foam that  control and correct foot mechanics. New plastic devices, such as Poly Prefabs, made of flexible polyethylene, are being introduced regularly. As these devices proliferate through the biomechanics mainstream, they will greatly expand the use of prefabs into treatment realms formerly exclusively addressed by custom devices.
<P>Clearly, the use of prefabs is often a money issue. Matching your clinical needs to the economic realities is as much a part of the doctor's decision as the prescription itself. "A custom will certainly fit better more of the time and therefore it's a better device, but it's a question of the patient incurring the expense," explains Eric Lauf, DPM, a trustee of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons who prescribes both customs and prefabs. In the <CITE>BioMechanics Magazine</CITE> mini-survey, more than half of those surveyed identified economics as the main reason they prescribe prefabs. Doctors are under intense pressure to be cost-effective. Therefore, they will use a prefab when the circumstances allow. 
<P>Saving money is good. The problem arises when managed care organizations compel the doctor to use a prefab against his better judgment. Worse, in some cases, the doctor may be under a gag rule prohibiting him from even discussing the matter with a patient. 
<P>Medicare and Medicaid have also fueled the prefab alternative. For thousands of diabetic patients receiving Medicare reimbursement under Diabetic Therapeutic Shoe provisions, reimbursement is so low, an inexpensive prefab is the only "choice." In those states where Medicaid still allows foot orthotics, again, the reimbursement level is so low, a prefab is dictated.
<P>All too often the doctor must triage the possibilities. What is the best he can do for you under the circumstances? He may think a prefab is the ideal choice for your treatment. He may also believe that a custom would be best, but a prefab will do if that's the best he can manage in a  managed care world.
<P>There's no use second guessing your practitioner on whether you need a prefab or a custom. The variables are too complex. Unfortunately, managed care often does second guess the doctor, mandating a prefab whether or not it's the best treatment. The best way to determine whether a prefab is for you is to simply ask your doctor. If that's his choice, you're okay--and that will be the case most of the time. But if he thinks a custom is better, you might want to pay for it yourself, just as many people still do for dental and eye care. Somewhere along the way, you and your doctor must decide which treatment is best for you--not some managed care executive. The buck stops with you.

<h2> I'm a diabetic. Can the shoes I wear really make a difference?</H2>
Yes. People with diabetes face a variety of medical complications from their disease. Of these, foot disease is the most common and accounts for 23 percent of the total number of days diabetic patients spend in the hospital. The most commonly found foot conditions include neuropathy (lack of sensation), structural deformities, calluses, skin and nail changes, foot ulcers, infection, and vascular disease. A program of prevention includes performing regular foot inspections, having your feet examined at doctor visits, following appropriate hygiene and injury prevention procedures, and wearing proper footwear.
<P>Excessive pressure and friction from the wrong kind of shoes or from poorly fitting shoes can lead to blisters, calluses, and ulcers not only in the insensitive foot, but also in feet with no evidence of neuropathy. And while there are no guarantees that proper footwear can prevent future problems, studies have shown that the use of special therapeutic shoes can significantly reduce the occurrence of ulceration and amputation.

<H2>Where can I go to find the right type of shoe?</H2> 
If you recently have been diagnosed with diabetes and have no history of foot problems or any loss of sensation, you can probably go to any shoe store with high quality shoes in a wide range of sizes. However, if you have any loss of sensation, it is highly recommended that you go to a qualified licensed practitioner who can determine your needs and fit your shoes. When left on their own, people with a lack of sensation tend to purchase shoes that are too tight, since the size that "feels" right is often too small due to the diabetic patient's lack of feeling.

<H2>How do I know if my shoes fit properly?</H2>
To get the right fit, consider both shoe shape and size. Try to match the shape of the shoe to the shape of your foot and be sure that your shoes have adequate room in the toe area, over the instep, and across the ball of the foot. There should be 3/8- to 1/2-inch between the end of the shoe and the longest toe. Don't forget that both length and width are important--not everyone fits into the most commonly available "medium" width shoes.

<H2>How does therapeutic footwear prevent foot problems?</H2>
People with diabetes are especially susceptible to the repetitive pressures exerted on their feet during normal walking and standing. One of the most important functions of therapeutic footwear is to relieve areas of excessive pressure on the bottom of your feet, and reduce the overall amount of vertical force (also called "shock") and the horizontal movement of your feet within your shoes (called "shear"). Therapeutic footwear also helps accommodate foot deformities and provide necessary joint support.

<H2>Do all people with diabetes need special therapeutic shoes?</H2>
Your doctor can best answer that question. If you have no history of foot problems or any loss of sensation, a properly fitting shoe made of soft materials with a shock absorbing sole may be all that you need. If you have any evidence of foot problems, your physician may prescribe a variety of special footwear options, including therapeutic shoes, shoe modifications, and orthoses or shoe inserts.

<H2>If I need therapeutic footwear, do I have to wear ugly orthopedic shoes?</H2>
So-called "orthopedic shoes" are a thing of the past. Unless you have a very severe foot problem that requires specially molded or custom-made shoes, today's therapeutic footwear doesn't have to look "orthopedic" at all. Most prescriptions can be filled using ordinary shoes--walking shoes, athletic shoes, work boots, and even dress shoes. Shoe modifications can be made to blend in with the shoes so that you may be the only one who knows you're wearing special shoes.

<H2>Will my insurance cover therapeutic footwear?</H2>
With the recent passage of the Therapeutic Shoe legislation, Medicare now offers coverage for therapeutic shoes, inserts, and shoe modifications for people with diabetes. Complete details on coverage can be obtained from the Department of Health and Human Services or from your doctor or pedorthic facility. Many other insurance companies offer at least partial coverage for special footwear prescribed by a physician.                 

Dennis Janisse, C.Ped, is a certified pedorthist, a licensed and certified practitioner who specializes in therapeutic shoes, among other things. Although he is not a doctor, he contributes to the Doctor's In column as one of the nation's leading pedorthic authorities. He is an honorary member of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society, a past president of the Pedorthic Footwear Association, and a lecturer to podiatric groups.

<HR>
I have a recurring dream in which I walk blissfully free
of the constraints of gravity. Upon each contact with the
ground I am bounced effortlessly into the air, traversing
perhaps 100 feet with each step in a graceful, arching
motion. Each step takes me high above the ground for a
dizzying view of the earth. But I always wake disappointed
that I cannot travel so effortlessly in my waking life.
<P>Last spring I decided it was time to invest in new
walking shoes. So I hit my local shopping mall. After trying
on  many pairs with no expert advice--none of the teeny
bopper sales assistants knew much about the products they
were selling-I tried on a pair that, unlike my snug well-
worn walking shoes, featured a rigid toe.
<P>Assistants knew much about the products they were
selling--I tried on a pair that, unlike my snug well-worn
walking shoes, featured a rigid toe box, which felt strange
because nothing was actually pressing against my toes. These
shoes featured multiple layers of shock-absorbing materials
with names most people would not recognize. The sales clerk
let me try them out on the hard marble mall floor outside
the store entrance. Heels fit snugly, not enough arch
support--but then nothing ever reaches up into my high
arches. Nonetheless, they felt pretty good. So I plunked
down my credit card.
<P>Dreading the process of "breaking them in," I laced them
up for my evening walk around the neighborhood.
<P>Wow! A block away from home I realized I was living my
dream. The drag of gravity felt cut in half. There was
spring in my step. I walked erect and proud, arms swinging.
My daughter, whose stamina usually exceeds mine, could
barely keep up with me. I didn't feel the gravel in the
roadway. At the end of my ritual mile, when I normally drag
myself into the house glad to be back, I insisted on
repeating the mile. I just didn't want to stop.
<P>What was it? Had someone slipped some potent secret
elixir into my egg drop soup at lunch? Or, could a pair of
good walking shoes really make a difference?
<P>The answer, say the experts, is a resounding yes.
Properly constructed, <A HREF="feat1sd1.html">properly fitted</A> shoes affect your
whole body, the way your bones, muscles and joints function
and move, and yes, even the way you feel--pinched feet
translate into pinched faces.
<P>The typical woman of the 1990s must survive a grueling
day on her feet, a day that often begins before dawn and
doesn't end until after 11pm. And,while business dress codes
have relaxed considerably over the last decade, in many
corporate settings women are still likely to wear business
suits and fashion heels. Why is it that we count the grams
of fat on product labels before buying anything in the
grocery store, feed calcium-rich broccoli to our families
and believe in consistent exercise--yet we're willing to wear
ill-fitting, unhealthy shoes? For the same reason Chinese
women, for more than a thousand years, bound their feet, and
Egyptian princesses walked on stilt sandals with nothing but
a knob between their toes to hold the shoes onto their feet:
To look "good"--or more precisely to conform to society's
notion of a "feminine" foot--small, dainty and narrow.
<P>Almost since the dawn of civilization, women have been
shoving their feet into shoes whose shapes bear little
resemblance to the shape of the human foot. Consider the
average dress pump. Squeezing your toes into a sharply
pointed triangular shape is different from Chinese foot
binding only in degree and the time it takes to create
deformity. One Los Angeles shoe retailer says that if a
woman tries on a pair of heels in his store and her toes
don't feel sufficiently squished, she will insist the shoe
is too big and ask for a smaller size.
<P>A 1991 landmark study of 356 women by Los Angeles-area
orthopedic surgeon Carol Frey, MD, of the American
Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society's Council on Women's
Footwear, found that 88 percent of American women wear shoes
that are too small for them.
<P>What's wrong with wearing shoes a half size too small?
Plenty. AOFAS estimates that women account for about 90
percent of surgeries for common foot problems such as
<A HREF="feat1sd2.html">bunions, bunionettes, hammertoes and neuromas</A>. Not
surprisingly, ill-fitting too tight shoes are the reason for
most of this surgery. Glen Pfeffer, MD, who chairs the AOFAS
Committee on Orthoses and Shoewear guesstimates, "There is
probably in excess of $3 billion annually in surgery due to
improper shoes and another 15 million lost work days each
year."
<P>Bad shoes also create unnatural movements, with painful
consequences that can be felt all the way up the body.
Dental technician Donna, now an avid long-distance runner,
reluctantly admits to being addicted to backless platform
heels during the 1970s and 1980s. But the unnatural motion
necessary to keep the shoes on her feet led to six surgeries
for hammertoes that cost her plenty of pain and time off the
job.
<P>Deformities aren't the only risks involved in wearing
fashionable but unhealthy shoes. Jennifer Georgia, an
editorial assistant at a New York-based fashion magazine,
has never once injured herself during the five years she has
practiced her passion of barefoot waterskiing. But last
summer while wearing her favorite pair of shoes--sling back
high-heeled sandals--she broke her tibia in two places while
leaning over to pick up a purse that had fallen to the
floor. The angle of her foot and leg in the heels, together
with her reflex action to right herself as she lost her
balance, snapped her leg like a tree branch under stress.
<P>A good pair of shoes, on the other hand, allows your feet
and lower extremities to move in a biomechanically correct
way. "<A HREF="feat1sd1.html">Proper shoe fit</A> with properly constructed shoes can
save precious healthcare dollars and personal suffering.
It's not a question of vanity, it's a question of health,"
says Dr. Pfeffer.
<P>For many women, it's not really a question of vanity, but
a question of choices--or more precisely, a lack of choices.
For decades the fashion industry has dictated the shape of
shoes just as it has dictated hem lengths. Today, however,
you can find fashionable clothing with hemlines ranging from
ankle to short mid-thigh lengths. Similarly, the shoe
industry is offering an increasingly wider variety of
styles.
<P>So is it possible to have shoes that both look good and
are good for you? Yes! Times have changed. When it comes to
footwear in the year 1996 you can wear beautiful,
fashionable shoes that also happen to be comfortable and
biomechanically correct. It's about time.

<H3><A HREF="feat1sd5.html">A New Trend Afoot</A></H3>

The trend for more comfortable footwear began a decade
ago when women began rebelling against painful shoes.
Remember the early 1980s when city streets across America
were filled with women of all ages in their dress-for-
success suits, walking to work in athletic shoes? Diane, an
adjuster at a New York insurance company recalls, "I carried
a briefcase in one hand and a bag containing my dress shoes
in the other. Then came the elevator shuffle. Provided my
boss was not in the same elevator, I switched out of my
jogging shoes into high heels and got off the elevator ready
to impress."
<P>"I know some women who changed a block from our
building," recalls Diane, "to avoid meeting anyone they knew
while still in cross-training shoes. I personally took the
elevator risk because I wasn't willing to walk even one
block in heels."
<P>In the 1990s, switching shoes on arrival at work has
fallen out of vogue, except for those who truly walk long
distances from home or train stations. Many women are
saying, "I want comfortable shoes, and I want to wear the
same shoe for walking and on the job."
<P>Shoe manufacturers heard the rumblings. Many
manufacturers and their marketing gurus have figured out
that baby boomers--and many of their younger sisters and
daughters--want to be comfortable. And the industry is
responding. Not only because their pocketbooks are
listening, but because science and engineering have
developed some astonishing new materials and shoe design
capabilities.
<P>Perhaps the company listening most closely to women was
Easy Spirit, a division of U.S. Shoe. Easy Spirit had
already broken ground in 1986 by launching the first walking
shoe made especially for women's feet. Incredible but true,
only 10 short years ago, women's walking and athletic shoes
were designed as scaled-down versions of men's shoes. In
1987, Easy Spirit executives marveled at the phenomenon
outside their windows--droves of women walking to work in
athletic shoes--and said, "What if we could build the same
cushioning and comfort features into a dress pump?"
<P>It was risky. Such a shoe, given the materials it would
require, would be pricey. Would women pay $69 for mass
merchandised dress shoes? "Sales-oriented executives went
with their instincts and decided to go for it," recounts
Randy Scott, vice president of marketing for Easy Spirit.
"We had years of experience producing a wide range of sizes
and some comfort features with Red Cross Shoes. So we
designed dress pumps with the same proprietary cushioning as
our
walking shoes, a roomier toebox, heel heights of 1, 1-1/2 and
2 inches, and the rest is history," says Scott.
<P>Ads showing women playing basketball in pumps made their
mark. Women flocked to Easy Spirit. By now, the company has
expanded its line to include greater variety in dress,
casual and walking shoes. Others followed their lead.
<P>Actually, a health-conscious comfort shoe industry has
always existed. Companies such as Drew, Lowell Shoe,
Naturalizer, Rockport and SAS have been making quality
comfort shoes for decades. Some of these traditional comfort
shoe companies catered mostly to problem feet and were
resigned to delivering function above fashion. But now these
companies began offering more fashionable styles.
<P>And soon some shoe manufacturers known for making fashion
statements began offering more comfortable features--Nine
West's SPA line, for instance. In recent years, a host of
European comfort shoes have become available on this side of
the Atlantic--Ecco, Mephisto, Birkenstock, Dansko and Josef
Siebel, to name a few. And, major shoe retailers everywhere
are now devoting larger areas of their floor space to
comfort shoes.
<P>Comfort is here to stay. But you must become a discerning
consumer. Just as the terms "low-fat" and "natural" were
misused on food labels as consumers began demanding
nutritional information, so too may some shoe manufacturers
play fast and loose with the comfort label. At a recent
exposition of shoe manufacturers, Stride editors stopped at
several booths selling shoes with the word "health" in their
name. At most booths, the executives explained why their
products were healthier and/or more comfortable. But for
some, the word "health" was just a come-on. At one booth, we
examined a flimsy but popular product, featuring an
exceptionally thin insole and little support. We asked the
manufacturer what justified the word "health" in the name.
He joked and said, "Nothing. It's cheap. It's healthy on
your pocketbook."

<H3>Comfort Shoe Anatomy</H3>

To become a savvy comfort shoe buyer, you need to
understand what makes a shoe "comfortable" and healthy.
<P>The most important component in the shoe you buy is
something you'll never see. It's the last, a form around
which the shoe is designed and built. Not unlike the dress
form a dressmaker uses to stand in for your body, the last
is the stand-in for your foot. Unfortunately some shoe
manufacturers don't employ enough varieties of lasts because
of the expense, so they make assumptions based upon the
shape of the average foot at various sizes and widths. For
instance, in a process called scaling, some manufacturers
increase the width in direct proportion to the length. But
women's feet don't necessarily follow that mathematical
formula. In fact, women tend to have narrow heels and wider
forefeet so a combination last would be ideal--a AAA heel
width and C forefoot width, for instance. Such combinations
are hard but not impossible, to find.
<P>The outer sole is the  foundation of the shoe. No one
would dream of making a foundation of a house smaller than
the house itself. Stand barefoot on a piece of paper and
have someone trace around your foot. If the outline of the
shoe is not the size and shape of that simple drawing, your
shoe doesn't fit, period.
<P>Your drawing will also tell you the shape your toes
occupy--and it ain't a triangle. "Wedging your foot into an
unrealistic shape will lead to deformities," warns Lowell
Scott Weil, DPM, one of America's leading podiatrists (see
<A HREF="feat1sd3.html">Bunions and Ill-Fitting Shoes</A>). Nor should your toes butt
against the end of the shoe as you walk. You need to leave
some wiggle room for your toes, so you need 3/8, to 1/2-inch
extra length for your longest toe at the end of each shoe.
<P>Like the human feet that walk in them, the soles should
be flexible. After all, your foot cannot move normally if it
is strapped to an unbending block of wood (which is why
platform shoes can lead to falls).
<P>If you've ever landed on your fanny on a slippery marble
floor, you know that traction is important. The soles of
athletic shoes are designed with specific surfaces in mind,
but everyday walking on common surfaces presents just as
many hazards. Take a good look at the bottom of the shoe
with safety in mind. A slippery leather bottom could send
you flying. On the other hand, rubber lugsoles bottoms,
while great for city sidewalks, can provide too much grip
when walking on a carpeted surface, leading to their own
trips and falls.
<P>The insole, the innermost part of the shoe where your
foot rests, needs to follow the curves of the bottom of your
foot, supporting it adequately, whether you're walking or
standing. Some shoes have little more than a thin layer of
padding, sometimes only a flat leather lining. Discount shoe
manufacturers save money by skimping here. A proper insole
offers protection from the shock your foot experiences every
time it meets the surfaces upon which you walk.
<P>The average person exerts 60 tons of force on each foot
for every mile she walks. Considering that, our feet are
miraculously designed. But given the unforgiving surfaces we
walk on, we need all the help we can get. Shock waves
emanating from ground reaction forces affect the entire
body, even the head.
Muscles are the main energy absorbers, but the knee, hip and
lower back also absorb shock. Over the years, the cumulative
effects of shock can produce knee instability and lower back
pain.
<P>Some added protection is now showing up in comfort lines
in the midsole, the material between the sole and the
insole. Athletic shoes have long featured shock absorbing
midsoles. Now look for it in dress and business shoes as
well. Shock absorption--at whatever layer--means more than
mere "cushioning"--a little soft padding in a shoe does not
qualify. Materials such as polyurethane and EVA foams, for
instance, provide good shock absorption and are lightweight.
<P>Shoe manufacturers joining the comfort revolution are
providing high-tech insoles and midsoles, the likes of which
could only be obtained through a doctor's prescription a
decade ago. Lowell Shoes' Soft Spots, for instance, borrow
the inner construction developed for its nurses line,
providing all customers with the same benefits developed for
medical personnel who may be on their feet 10 hours per day.
Some Easy Spirit shoes employ four layers of cushioning with
varying densities for specific areas. Some comfort shoes,
such as Finn Comfort and Rockport, now offer a pick and
choose variety of insoles so you can select the one that
best fits your foot and anticipated activity. By the way,
placing an over-the-counter pad of foam, such as a Dr.
Scholl's insole, into an uncomfortable shoe will not
transform it into a comfortable shoe.
<P>Arch support is an important component--but since the
placement and height of arches is so individual, many women
need to add arch support via an inset.
<P>The upper part of the shoe--known as uppers--should be made
of soft materials that "breathe." Soft, because you don't
want harsh materials rubbing against your toes to cause
discomfort or corns. Breathable, because the average foot
has 250,000 sweat glands that continuously produce moisture.
To allow air circulation, uppers should not fit too tightly
around the foot. Traditionally, leather is considered the
best upper. But some new manmade alternatives, such as a
nylon and polyurethane material used by Deja Shoes, offer
the same characteristics as leather. By the way, insoles
should also absorb and wick away moisture.
<P>What about the heel? A properly fitting heel "counter"
stabilizes your foot. The counter is that slightly stiffer
part of the upper that wraps around the heel. It should fit
snugly enough so that your heel does not slip as you walk.
Underfoot, a stacked, blocky heel provides much more
stability than a tapered heel. Fortunately, block heels are
back in style.
<P>Backless shoes, as one would expect, lack stability,
causing ankles to wobble with each step. Exceptions are
molded bottom sandals and clogs,  la Birkenstock, which
offer a heel bed that cradles the bottom shape of the heel.
Designed like the imprint of your foot in damp sand, the
cork footbed of the popular German Birkenstock or the
Israeli-made Naot sandal literally molds to the shape of
your foot as you wear it. The caveat here: neither clogs nor
sandals are ideal for walking. But for people who do a lot
of standing--such as grocery store clerks, nurses or chefs--
Dansko clogs, with their highly sophisticated shock
absorption features, can feel wonderful.
<P>The big question: heel height. How high can you go? Stand
barefoot on the floor. Raise your heel an inch off the
floor, then gradually higher. Feel the muscles in your
calves. Note the tension and strain as your heel moves
higher and higher. It may feel good for a stretching
exercise, but think of holding that position for eight
hours. Let's face it--you are straining these tendons every
time you wear high heels. You literally can feel which heel
height is the most comfortable. Many women with high long
arches swear their feet feel better when they wear a mid-
heel rather than flats. Besides the strain on calf tendons,
high heels force the toes down into the toe box, placing
extra strain on the forefoot. "Most podiatrists, says Justin
Wernick, DPM, a leading authority on walking problems,
"recommend a heel between one and two inches, and never
higher than two inches."
<P>As for the consequences of high, tapered heels, if you've
ever struggled along in stiletto heels, you know how your
ankles wobble from side to side with each heel strike,
placing you at risk for a painful ankle sprain if the spike
falls into a crack in the pavement.
<P>Even if you're able to gracefully maneuver over hostile
terrain, the instability inherent in stiletto heels
translates into pain in the ankles, legs and particularly
the lower back as your spine is thrown into an exaggerated
lordotic curve--the lordotic curve is the natural curve of
the lower back. Besides  pain, over time the high heel
wearer is likely to develop forefoot deformities or chronic
tendonitis from the cumulative strain on calf muscles.
<P>But let's face it. Even the most savvy, health-conscious
women sometimes can't resist wearing high heels, especially
for special occasions. Dr. Frey offers this realistic
advice: "Yes, go ahead and wear that pair of beautiful dress
heels, but for no more than two or three hours at a time."

<H3>What's Your Shoe Size?</H3>

Of course, all the comfort characteristics in the world
won't do you any good unless the shoe fits properly. Your
first step in finding the right fit is knowing your correct
shoe size. Keep in mind that your shoe size may not be what
you think, or what you've been told in the past. That's
because our feet simply become larger as time goes by. It's
not that our feet actually grow. Rather, our arches "fall,"
and the ligaments connecting the bones in our feet stretch,
causing the foot to become longer and wider over time.
Pregnancy can speed up this natural progression. After
carrying around that extra 30-40 lbs. for a few months, many
women find themselves needing a half- or even full-size
larger shoe and extra width.
<P>Weight gain can have the same effect. Dr. Frey studied 88
women over a five year period and found that of those women
who gained 20 lbs. or more during the study, 93 percent
increased in shoe size, compared to 31 percent of those
women who maintained the same weight.
<P>The bottom line: be sure to have your foot measured at
the shoe store before you try on your next pair of shoes.
(Dr. Frey's study found that most women hadn't had their
feet measured in five years!) If the sales clerk doesn't
offer to measure your foot, take the initiative and insist.
<P>Don't buy a shoe that doesn't fit. Pretty simple,
reasonable advice. But let's be honest--we've all bought
shoes that we knew didn't fit. Never mind the excuses you
(or your sales associate) may manufacture when you find a
shoe that looks good, is perfect for a certain dress, but
doesn't quite feel right. "It'll stretch out," or "It needs
to be broken in." No. If it doesn't feel good now, it will
only feel worse later. The notion that a shoe needs "to be
broken in" is left over from the days when footwear was made
of rougher, less pliable materials. A shoe can and should
feel good the day you buy it, and become even more
comfortable as it molds to your foot over time.

<H3>Finding the Right Fit</H3>

It's one thing to say a shoe must fit. It's quite another
to find a shoe that does indeed fit. For instance, in
Stride's small editorial office, one woman is a size 4 and
two women wear a size 11. Our size 4 colleague often settles
for children's shoes. And our size 11 coworkers end up
either stuffing their feet into size 10 or buying men's
shoes. Yet many comfort shoe manufacturers produce women's
shoes in sizes 4 to 12, in four or five different widths.
The problem is getting them to the marketplace. Many
retailers simply can't afford to stock a wide variety of
sizes. I have not spoken to even one woman, who having found
a shoe she liked but not in her size, was told she could
special order the correct size. Yet many independently-owned
retailers stock shoes in a wide variety of sizes, and
routinely special order for hard-to-fit customers. Some even
publish catalogs. If you know of such a store, reward them
with your business. If you can't find such a source, the
National Shoe Retailers Association (1-800-673-8446) can
help you locate a service-oriented retailer near you. <A HREF="storelist.html">The
Stride Comfort Shoe Store List</A> offers a partial
list.
<P>Two caveats here. One, to special order you will have to
possess the resolve and patience to wait for the shoe to
arrive.  Many women tie shoe shopping to an occasion, a
wedding, a vacation trip. You will need to plan ahead and
allow time to locate the right shoe.
<P>Second, special and hard-to-fit sizes generally cost
more, according to Bill Boettge of the National Shoe
Retailers Association. In fact, that is true of all quality
"comfort" shoes. Shoes should be thought of as an
investment, not an accessory. When it comes to the cost of
shoes, look at it this way: better to pay $100 for a good
pair of shoes now than thousands of dollars for a joint
replacement later. Put another way, since an estimated
400,000 needless bunionectomies are performed each year (at
an estimated cost of more than $3 billion) due to ill-
fitting shoes, next time you go looking for a bargain, count
the expense, the pain and the time off your job for bunion
surgery.

<H3>A Look Ahead</H3>

One day very soon you will walk into the mall and at any
good shoe store or perhaps a tiny kiosk in the hallway, your
foot will be electronically scanned. Every aspect of its
size and shape will be instantly analyzed, creating in
effect a "personal last." Then you'll step on a treadmill
apparatus where you'll walk, run and climb stairs as your
personal gait characteristics are factored in. You may then
answer a dozen questions about your environment--what kind of
surfaces you walk on at home and at work, how many hours you
are on your feet, what are your leisure activities? Then
you'll choose a genre of footwear, be it workboots, sandals,
dress shoes or sport-specific athletic shoes. You'll pick
and choose colors, heel height and a dozen other styling
factors. And a few days later--maybe a few hours later--a shoe
made especially for your foot, your gait patterns and your
environment will be in your hands. Not too different from
prescription lenses in an hour.
<P>Until then, you can make a difference. Your buying
habits, complaints and praise can affect the manufacturing
and retailing of footwear. You can become educated in proper
footcare and footwear in the same way you learned about the
harmful effects of nicotine or the hidden fat in processed
food.
<P>You can find, buy and wear healthy, comfortable,
beautiful shoes. You can even come home at the end of the
day, blissfully unaware of your feet. They will have become
something taken for granted upon which you propel yourself
through life, the objects of beauty and function rather than
embarrassment, resentment, and pain. A dream come true.

<H1>Biomechanics: Secrets of Body Motion</H1>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Understanding lower body biomechanics means unlocking the secrets of how your body moves.</B></FONT>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<I>For a moment, imagine the flickering images of an antique photo display as the human form stroboscopically undertakes that most fundamental and eloquent expression of human motion: the simple act of walking. Watch as the legs, knees, arms and back 
move harmoniously to propel the body forward. Now imagine a tall, sweating basketball player leaping toward the hoop, a bride gracefully walking down the aisle, a couple kicking autumn leaves as they stroll through the park. Imagine a baby struggling to stand erect and take its first step. All of this and more is the beauty and complexity of the body science of biomechanics.</I>
<P>Let's take this one step at a time. Every time you take a single step, a complex concert of anatomy, earth physics and physiology plays out to create the music of human motion. This is biomechanics. Understanding how your foot, knee, hip and back relat
e to lower body biomechanics will help you unlock the secrets of your own motion-one step at a time. And it will help you attain a greater feeling of health, fitness and well-being.
<H4>The Shocking Truth</H4>
In a lifetime, most people walk the equivalent of 3.5 trips around the world. Every step you take launches an extraordinary gravity defying contact with the earth. The average person takes 9,000 such steps every day. Each one of those steps encounters a s
hock wave from so-called ground reaction forces. In other words, when you bump into the earth, your body feels it. The greater the force of your step, the more force comes back at you. For example, when you run, your lower extremities absorb two to five t
imes your body weight in ground reaction forces.
<P>Shock waves emanating from the ground can affect your entire body. They transduce right up through the shoe, through your muscles and foot, ankle and leg bones, on through the hip up the spine, and eventually up to 25 percent of the shock waves even re
ach the head--all within 10 milliseconds. Walking, or as doctors call it, ambulation, involves sustaining constant shocks to the system.
<P>Muscles are the main shock absorbers, say gait experts Joseph Hamill, PhD, and Timothy Derrick, PhD, but the knee, hip and lower back also absorb ground energy. The cumulative effects of shock can promote knee instability and lower back pain, and take 
its toll on your entire kinetic chain--that is, the foot to back body structures that control movement. Indeed the entire spine and its support structures can be compromised, causing back pain, says physiatrist Phillip Harris, MD, an expert on back pain. 
Dr. Harris, like many doctors, believes many forms of back pain can be traced to an individual's lower body biomechanics.
<P>Because shock reaches the skull, dentists believe ground shock may contribute to jaw pain. And the connection to headaches is now being investigated. Even the breathing rate of runners can be reduced by shock absorbing shoes, says physiatrist Steven Ge
iringer, MD, a running expert based in Detroit, Michigan.
<P>A biomechanically correct, shock absorbing shoe is one of the first lines of defense. The more absorbent that entire interface is--that is, the sole, insole and overall construction of the shoe--the less ground reaction force is left to transmit up thr
ough the system. Technically, good shoes provide a combination of shock absorption and shock distribution. 
<P>A second line of defense is adjusting the surface you stand or walk on. Researchers have traced some forms of back pain to prolonged standing in place, especially on the job. One answer: padded floor mats. But it's not that simple. Too much padding can
 misalign your stance and worsen the situation. Just enough padding for the specific job site reduces the strain on your entire body. It varies with every situation and requires more than just shopping for any old floor mat at the hardware store, but test
ing and analysis to select the correct industrial mat.
<H2>Know Your Limitations</H2>
Dealing with shock is just one part of the biomechanics story. While your lower extremities are absorbing jolts, they must also be sturdy and flexible enough to support the entire body. Our tendons, joints and ligaments not only absorb and redistribute sh
ock, but also function as good energy rebound systems. Consider the possibilities: a man steps into a van, a child jumps across a puddle, a high jumper glides over the bar, a ballet dancer pirouettes across the stage. Take none of that for granted. There'
s a reason why there are 26 bones in each foot. The foot is a complex machine of levers and joints that Da Vinci described as a "marvel."
<P>Some hard biomechanical facts you must live with include the whole issue 
of range of motion (ROM). The major joints--hip, knee, ankle, and foot joints--these all have a normal range of motion that allows your body to move harmoniously and without pain. Next time you walk up steps, think about your movement. Your ankles and kne
es are bending at the joints in an off-kilter manner. But if they can't bend as far as they should because of either a deformity you were born with or an injury or strain you've sustained, your whole body will compensate in some way by using muscles or jo
ints off-kilter. That will affect the way you absorb shock, and of course your ability to move normally and pain-free.
<P>ROM problems can be either in the bone or the muscle. If you were born with a short gastrocnemius--a lower leg muscle crucial to walking--you can't lengthen it. But sometimes you can compensate with a heel lift or other treatment to reposition the foot
 and leg with respect to the ground, explains Sheldon Langer, DPM, a noted podiatrist. If your range of motion problem is due to an injury, good physical therapy can gradually restore function. Restoring ROM may require measures ranging from high-tech leg
 stretching devices to low-tech personal rehabilitation exercises you can do at home. In some extreme cases, surgery may be required.
<H2>The Future Next Year</H2>
Researchers are teaming up with market savvy businesspeople to improve your quality of biomechanical life. Foot scanners made by a company named Benefoot are now popping up in doctors' and therapists' offices. Your foot is laser scanned. The image is then
 transmitted to a fabrication device, in some cases across the country, but sometimes no further away than the end of the corridor. Out comes a custom orthotic that the practitioner fits to your shoe to treat a gait problem or to prevent one.
<P>Soon it will be possible to walk into any advanced shoe store and obtain the shoe that's precisely right for your foot. Such shoes will address minor limb length discrepancies, unequal foot sizes and any special characteristics of your foot. 
<P>Gait analysis engineers now rig cameras and sensor plates to computers to dissect every aspect of lower body motion. Orthopedic surgeons report they are now using gait analysis studies to determine if a previously fitted knee brace, back brace, foot or
thotic or even a running shoe is helping or hurting. Using trial and error fitting techniques, a patient's final outcome dramatically improves.
<P>Occupational engineers and therapists are now using motion and gait analysis surveys to determine the varying effects of walking miles every day on the job. From the plush executive carpet to the hard concrete factory floor, workplace surfaces carry th
eir own biomechanical ramifications.
<H2>The Biomechanics Mainstream</H2>
Clearly, we routinely undertake biomechanical activities of enormous consequences every day. Your activities, sports, workstyle and lifestyle, the shoes you wear, the loads you carry--they all affect the way you walk and feel. The right way can minimize y
our pain and maximize your sense of mobility. The wrong way can bring you gradual decline into painful or arthritic motion. If you're really wrong about the way you move you could sustain permanent injury.
<P>People have been abusing their lower extremities for a long time. Their top halves have suffered as well. Improving your biomechanics is 
a stride toward a better lifestyle. Good biomechanics is more than just the motions you make. It's a movement you should join.

<H1>Surfing the Slopes</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>America's fastest growing snow sport is causing an epidemic of winter fun, and a flurry of sports injuries. But understanding the sport can minimize the risks.</B></FONT>

<HR>
Snowboarding has taken the ski slopes like a slow blizzard. In the last 10 years, snowboarding has gone from a rebel's ride for wild teenage boys who jump over "slow skiing" signs to a new route down the mountain for their skiing parents. More than two million snowboarders slide down trails all over the world. Many of them are passionate about their sport, and make repeated visits to the slopes every year. Originally, snowboarding was a guy thing. But now women are becoming a rapidly growing segment of the sport--an estimated 30 percent. 
<P>Before you hit the slopes, you should be aware that snowboarding is not entirely without risk. The most common snowboarding injuries are to the extreme lower wrist. When the snowboarder falls backward or forward, she hyperextends her wrist to break the fall and protect herself. Novice shredders are constantly falling and therefore account for the largest segment of these injuries. No one--novice or expert--should hit the slopes without wrist guards. In-line skating-style guards will do, and they should be rented or purchased right along with the snowboard, and of course right along with the helmet. But every part of your body is vulnerable. Lower extremity injuries from hip to toe are the second most likely. However, doctors treating snowboarders find everything from ruptured spleens to dislocated shoulders to dental injuries.
<P>Despite these injuries, snowboarding is no more dangerous than skiing. Its rate of injury is equivalent to three injuries per 1,000 snowboarding days. Still, skiing injuries for beginners and novices are 12 times more likely than for advanced enthusiasts. A key factor in <A HREF="#mini">minimizing your risk</A> is understanding what the sport is all about.

<H2>Surfing the Dynamics</H2>

"Snowboarding is an intuitive sport, rather than a counter-intuitive sport," says Bob Hernreich, a 51-year-old snowboarding instructor in Vail. "Skiing, you have to coordinate left to right. Snowboarding is more direct. All your body parts are going in the same direction," he continues. "Skiers get hurt because their body parts are going in different directions."
<P>"You use your whole body," says Doug Paladini, whose magazine <I>Snowboarder</I> is another indication that snowboarding is going mainstream. There are three snowboarding magazines now as well as a trade publication. 
<P>To start, the snowboarder clicks into the bindings, firmly attached to the board, before she ventures down the slopes. But make sure those first slopes are the bunny slopes. "The learning curve is frightfully steep, and mercifully short," says Bill Gottlieb, MD, a 40-year-old snowboarder who each winter treats sports injuries at Vail-Summit Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine in Vail, Colorado.
<P>"You get pretty beat up in the beginning," he admits. "You walk around, you're pretty sore, you can't sleep at night. Then you put a couple of turns together and you're over the hump." It helped that Gottlieb is a longtime surfer. "Snowboarding was a natural kind of a progression," he explains. "I'd skied before, but surfing was kind of my lead-in to snowboarding." In fact, his summers are spent in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he can surf the Atlantic's waves and work as an emergency room physician. Wintertime comes and he's off to the slopes of Colorado.
<P>It took Roger Lohr, 40, a good three years and a pair of bruised ribs to get good at snowboarding. Now an enthusiastic snowboarder and director of education and special interests for Ski Industries America, Lohr still remembers the day he tried to conquer the easiest trail on the mountain. He refers to it as "the day of a hundred falls." 
<P>But Hernreich insists that it is 100 times easier to learn to snowboard than it is to learn to ski. "You can learn snowboarding in four days," he says. "It'll take you 10 years to become a decent skier." That is in large part why snowboarding has become such a fast-growing sport. 
It's easy. Or at least it seems easy.
<P>Paladini agrees that learning to snowboard is "simple, and you progress pretty rapidly. You use your whole body, so it's much easier to correct your mistakes."
<P>But if you're going to hit the slopes on a snowboard, accidents and injuries will happen. 

<H2>Snowboarder's Fracture</H2>

Almost as prevalent as wrist injuries is a previously uncommon fracture of the lateral process of the talus--that is, the outside front of the ankle. After seeing scores of these in our practice, we have dubbed it Snowboarder's Talus Fracture. This injury, accounting for 15 percent or more of all snowboarding ankle injuries, often mimics an ankle sprain. Fractures can be mistaken for ligament pain. Indeed, it can be missed by the doctor unless he or she is aware of it. Because the fracture sometimes is not detected on normal x-rays, a CT scan may be required. 
<P>If a Snowboarder's Talus Fracture is missed, it can lead to permanent discomfort and even disability. If the fracture doesn't heal correctly, arthritic conditions can set in within six to 12 months. But if properly treated, either by immobilization for four to six weeks or in some cases surgical repair, you'll probably regain full function and only experience minimal discomfort.
<P>The factor that contributes to the widespread occurrence of Snowboarder's Talus Fracture is the unique position of the feet themselves in a typical surfboarder's stance during the fall. But we still can't say if one stance is safer than another. Nor do we know if harder boots that might protect the foot merely transfer the injury up the leg 
to the knee. We do know this much: because snowboarding began as a boy sport, until recently women were forced to wear men's boots designed and constructed for the male foot. Newer models are designed to fit the female foot shape more securely, especially in the heel.

<H2>A Lexicon of Injuries</H2>

A fractured talus is only one of many types of lower extremity snowboarding injuries you can sustain. In an ongoing survey of 2,700 snowboarding injuries which occurred at 10 Colorado ski resorts from 1988 to 1994, lower extremity injuries accounted for 35 percent of the total for both men and women. Traditionally, most of those lower extremity injuries--77 percent--occur to the foot and leg positioned forward on the board.
<P>Fractures, sprains and strains, contusions, dislocations, ruptures--these are all words you might hear after a snowboarding mishap. Your ankles, toes, heels, shins and knees are all at risk. Among the most vulnerable knee structures are the collateral ligaments. Medial collateral ligaments (MCL) and anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) stabilize the knee--you can't function normally without them. When they suffer the impact and twisting of a snowboarding fall, they can rupture. Yet snowboarders encounter knee injuries far less often than skiers.
<P>The popularity and growth of the sport is itself causing changes in injury patterns. For example, more women are showing up on the injury list. And more enthusiasts are coming directly to snowboarding, bypassing skiing altogether. That means more novice injuries. 
<P>In previous phases of the snowboarding injury survey, the average age for female shredders was 18. Today, the 
average age is 22. "There's nothing inherent about the sport that requires you to be young," says Paladini. One estimate puts the over-25 set at 25 percent of the snowboarding population.
<P>What's more, today there are more ACL injuries than six years ago. Why? Perhaps it's because of more "flat landings." Snowboarders are taking more jumps, and catching air without knowing their landing area. When they land on a flat surface instead of an incline, knee injury can result. The severity of the damage depends upon the fall. But here's a hint about just how severe snowboarding falls can be. Start by acknowledging that "fall" may not be quite the right word to use. You don't just fall when you snowboard. You're sucked to the earth--really slammed down. If you meet the planet with enough force onto your wrists, surgeons could be reconstructing your wrist bones. Those concerned with snowboarding safety are aware of this. Instructors are now trying to convince people to fall onto their balled up fists or elbows. But this is easier said than done because of a combination of biomechanics, sheer instinct and plain old gravity.
<P>So you want to snowboard safely? Have your equipment fitted by experienced shop personnel, take lessons from a qualified instructor, check out your landings before you catch serious hospital air, leave your attitude at home and wear a wrist support.
<P>It may take several lessons, or at least several hours, to get the hang of snowboarding. But judging from the enthusiasm of the snowboarders, including the many doctors and allied health personnel who engage in it, the thrill is worth it and can be experienced safely.
<P>Dr. Gottlieb says, "I'll never ski again."

<H2><A NAME="mini">Minimizing Injuries</A></H2>

<UL>
<LI>Simply listen to your body. If you're beat, especially at the end of the day, turn in. Tired or unresponsive muscles are more prone to falls. Don't take that "one more run."

<P><LI>Avoid icy conditions. The harder and more slippery the surface, the more punishing and uncontrolled the fall can be. 

<P><LI>Wear a wrist guard. Renting or purchasing wrist guards right along with that snowboard and boots is a must. If you want to buy one, the wrist guards used for roller blading will do even though they are hardly ideal. With their big turnbuckles, they are bulky, so they won't fit well under gloves. Two companies are designing a lower profile fit that would be rented along with the other snowboarding equipment. 

<P><LI>To minimize the possibility of a fractured or sprained wrist, try to fall onto balled up fists or elbows. 

<P><LI><P>Beginners should wear helmets and hockey pads.

<P><LI>Make sure your boots fit properly and that your board is the proper length. Some companies now design boards specifically for women and children. 

<P><LI>Don't let friends tempt you to the top of the hill. Start with the bunny slope. Another way to put it is: friends don't let friends start at the top of the hill. Remember Roger Lohr's "day of a hundred falls" occurred on the easiest trail of the mountain. It helps if you start out on powdery snow, which is easier to negotiate than slushy, patchy or icy conditions. But once you gain some proficiency, you can remember that snowboarders ride the "shoulders" of the ski season, when many skiers have given up.

<P><LI>Take lessons from a qualified instructor using only equipment properly fitted by experienced shop personnel. 
<P><LI>Take lessons from someone who knows not only equipment, but techniques for beginners. Many ski resorts now have instructors for snowboarding and special areas designated for boards. Check them out.

<H1>Footloose in Jerusalem</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Walking through Jerusalem is a challenge, an inspiration, a political statement and an unforgettable experience.</B></FONT>
<P><I>by Edwin and Elizabeth Black</I>
</CENTER>

<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n1/i2.jpg" WIDTH=151 HEIGHT=145 ALT="view of the Old City from East Jerusalem" ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>When the new day's sun pushes up beyond the shield of the Judean Hills, morning's sunlight courses tortuously throughout the ancient new city, illuminating roadways, alleyways, parklands and rocky lots, one by one, as if visual doors are being unlocked in sequence by the finger of God. On cue, the motors of the Jerusalem bus system collectively ignite. And the buses begin their growling routes signalling the workday frenzy to begin again.
<P>Soon the majestic gold shimmer of the Dome of the Rock, the gleaming white mass of the Knesset and the centuries old stone ramparts of the Old City come alive.
<P>Jerusalem is electric. The ground itself is charged with the anguish and the aspirations of centuries. Here there will be no spiritual compromise for the many groups that lay claim to its soul. So much here is positive, so much negative, that Jerusalem creates its own emotional battery. As you walk its force fields, you can't help but quiver in its awesome energy and feel the power surging through your body. Step here in Jerusalem and step toward eternity; for here is where it began and here it shall end. 
<P>Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims, tourists, conventioneers and businesspeople who walk through Jerusalem pass through its political upheaval unscathed. But the welcoming inhabitants subtly vie for small victories of passing understanding and solidarity from generally unaware visitors. You see, every inch of Jerusalem is the epicenter of a long terr
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n1/itable.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=154 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="a typical coffee conversation in the Old City">
itorial or internecine dispute. So where you walk becomes of vital if fleeting importance to just about everyone. In Jerusalem, every footfall is a political statement, intended or not. Are you visiting an Islamic shrine or Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Memorial? Are you buying bread from an Arab baker, or an Israeli one--or from an Israeli vendor who is selling Arab--based bread? Are you having lunch in West Jerusalem or East? 
<P>Yet this is a city that cries out for walking, personal exploration, for a crusade of discovery. So you will need a good pair of walking shoes, ankles ready for the oblique angles of Jerusalem's cobblestones and knees ready for the many steps cut into the city's gentle hills.
<P>Of course, you will need a suitable starting place. Really, there can be none better than the <A HREF="jhotels.html"> King David Hotel,</A> arguably Jerusalem's most distinguished hotel, noted for its hosting of foreign dignitaries. During last year's funeral for Yitzhak Rabin, the King David hosted scores of heads of states and official delegations. Aside from being Israel's most stately hotel, the King David is a walker's dream. It is just a 10-minute uphill jaunt from the center of Jerusalem, down the street from the Jerusalem Gardens and Liberty Park, above the architectonic Yemin Moshe artists' quarter, and of course directly across from the Old City. David's Gate can be seen any time from the grand patio. 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n1/israel2.JPG" WIDTH=134 HEIGHT=198 ALT="market in Central Jerusalem" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>And the Old City is indeed an ideal starting point. Early morning is best. You'll traverse ancient, narrow alleys of uneven, timeworn stone. Foot traffic must occasionally yield to heavily-laden donkeys, the merchants' time-tested way of getting merchandise to their shops. At tiny cafes along the narrow alleys, you can sip tea with nana (mint leaves) for a gentle beginning, or a dense aromatic cup of Turkish coffee with cardamom for a robust wake up. Shopkeepers are setting up, opening for 
the business of luring tourists to their cubicle-sized shops with "a great deal just for you." Never, never pay the first price mentioned. Go ahead. Practice the art of bargaining with unabashed zeal. If you're good at it, the second day you wander down David Street you will incur ancient Arabic curses it's better you don't understand. 
<P>If you are seeking the seven stations of the cross on Via Dolorosa, the city of Jesus Christ's time is located several layers under the present Old City. (Some would argue it is actually outside the present city walls.) But there are places in the Old City where you can descend down to those ancient layers and actually touch the very stones of biblical times. David's City is an extraordinary subterranean dig within the Old City. Along the way you can discover exquisite art galleries or walk through a water tunnel from 500 B.C. 
<P>The Wailing Wall is so sacred to Judaism because it's made from the 
actual stones of the only remaining part of the Second Temple. Several routes through the Old City lead there, including one that passes through the Arab shops of David Street, then through 
the beautifully restored Jewish Quarter, through some archeological sites and finally to a magnificent overview of the entire plaza from which you walk down to the Wall.
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n1/i3.jpg" WIDTH=148 HEIGHT=147 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Bedouin woman pausing in a doorway in Jericho">
<P>The Dome of the Rock, with its gleaming golden dome and intricate tile adornments, is a landmark of Jerusalem and one of Islam's holiest sites. Within its sacred walls is the enormous rock from which Mohammed ascended to heaven. Be sure to dress appropriately when visiting the Dome of the Rock or any of the holy sites of all three great religions who count Jerusalem as their spiritual home. 
<P>More than just a center for three great religions, the Old City is a pulse of Mideast life. Its magnificent market sells fruits and nuts, spices, and leather and brass goods. The Old City is politically tense, but is generally not a problem for tourists and pilgrims. Just be aware, be single-minded and don't be afraid to suddenly walk away from a conversation or a "bargain" you don't want. In any event, enjoy the Old City during daylight hours.

<P>Spend your evenings strolling with the locals down the Midrahov, a network of central Jerusalem streets closed to auto traffic and lined with sidewalk cafes, espresso bars and boutiques. The shops may look trendy, but the social ritual of the street is as ancient as time itself. Start your walk at King Solomon Street where the best Oriental (Oriental here is not Chinese take out; it's Arabic, Middle Eastern fare) food can be enjoyed at the falafel and shwarma stands, while people watch themselves and everyone else. You'll quickly notice that many young Israelis favor the most bizarre edge of fashion. You'll see the highest, most dangerous platform heels and outrageous patent leather thigh-high boots that ever walked cobblestone. Foot and leg injuries are epidemic. Israeli podiatrists are a busy bunch. Don't mimic the young natives. You will need very stable shoes with extremely high shock absorption qualities to comfortably and safely walk the stone streets of Jerusalem. High heels are deadly because of the chinks and cracks and purposely-uneven, rough hewn paving stone of the average Jerusalem sidewalk. 
<P>If you want to wander, the meandering is unforgettable at Yemin Moshe, built into the slopes below the King David and across from the Old City. Jerusalem's artists, especially sculptors, dwell here in splendid if small stone abodes. Many of them sell from their studios. The artwork is exquisite. Bring your checkbook.
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n1/i4.jpg" WIDTH=151 HEIGHT=154 ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="sunset on the camel caravan tour">
<P>If you want a breathtaking vista of Jerusalem, hop into a car or take a bus to the Promenade, a long network of walkways carved into the hills south of Jerusalem near the suburb of Talpiot. Don't leave Jerusalem before spending a sunset walking the Promenade.
<P>You could spend an entire month in Jerusalem and it would be no more than a scouting mission. Shrine of the Book, the newly relocated Biblical Zoo, the Israel Museum, Knesset, Yad Vashem, the Garden Tomb. Liberty Park, Jerusalem Gardens. Nearby Bethlehem. You need to plan carefully if your time is limited.
<P>Planning will be your biggest problem. Jetlag is unpredictable, and experiencing Jerusalem is more than just seeing it. We prefer to wander and just soak up the city, all best done on foot. In Jerusalem, the experience is just being there.

<H2>Where to Stay</H2>
</CENTER>
<H2>Jerusalem</H2>  
<B>King David.</B> Arguably the most stately hotel 
in Israel and certainly the hotel with the most character. Loaded with foreign dignitaries 
and veteran visitors to Israel. Coffee or tea on the patio is an event. Centrally located for everything.
<P><B>Hyatt Regency.</B> Located on Mt. Scopus with panoramic views of the city, the Hyatt may have Jerusalem's most inviting pool. Wonderful grounds ideal for moonlight walking. A favorite with tour groups and even Israelis from other cities. Exquisite and expensive art galleries.

<H2>Tel Aviv</H2>
<B>Hilton.</B> Tel Aviv's top hotel, say many. Fantastic beachfront and pool area. Frequented by international businessmen, airline pilots and film stars. Exquisite restaurants. The lobby to be for coffee and pastries.
<H3>Dead Sea</H3> 
<B>Nirvana.</B> The best of the Dead Sea health spas has an elegant sports club, sumptuous buffets, and a wonderful beach on the Dead Sea where everything floats due to the high salt content. Mineral mud baths. Jeep and hiking tours organized. Near Masada.

<H2>Eilat</H2>
<B>Princess.</B> Israel's most lavish hotel is built into the side of a massive rock, with towering glass walls to bring the lobby dining halls into the mountain itself. Great restaurants, lobby music and entertainment. World class spa and sports club. Extraordinary multi-level swimming pool complex. Just a 15-minute walk from the Egyptian border crossing at Taba. 
<H3>Best restaurant</H3>
<B>Mama Mia</B> in Jerusalem. It's so hard to find, having its address is worthless. Just try to find a taxi driver who really knows the location. The pastas and Israeli-style appetizers are mouth watering. The ambience is an unforgettable garden in an old Turkish style mansion. You may find yourself waiting for a long time but it is worth it. Inexpensive.
<P><B>Israeli Fast Food</B> offers the best pizza in the world, especially with green olives. Ditto for falafel and shwarma.

<B>Underfoot</B>
<H1>The Truth About Insoles</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>The difference between the common insole that comes in your shoe and sophisticated custom orthotics dispensed by a doctor can be confusing. Here's a primer.</B></FONT>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I></BR>
</CENTER>
<HR>
The insole and orthotic market has exploded, creating plenty of consumer confusion in the blast. Just what are <I>insoles,</I> what are <I>orthotics,</I> how much should they cost, where do you get them and what can they do for you? The details are often debated by healthcare professionals who work with insoles and orthotics daily. Construction techniques, materials, therapeutic benefits, the effects on walking and running--there are plenty of opinions. Understandably, the consumer easily gets lost in the shuffle.
<P>That's why <I>Stride's</I> Underfoot column will draw on the expertise of our sister publication, <I>BioMechanics,</I> to answer the most important questions consumers face about what they should and should not put in their shoe. Making the right decision can help forestall a future foot or back problem, or help remedy an existing condition. For instance, the right orthotic can relieve heel pain, correct a malaligned gait, promote safe and efficient running and even save the life of a diabetic patient with an insensitive foot. 
<P>Choosing the wrong device can actually create more problems than it solves. Ironically, the more options you have, the more difficult it becomes to choose correctly.

<H2>Insoles vs. Orthotics</H2>

First some definitions. An <I>insole</I> is the flat cushioning interface between the shoe and your foot. Because a common insole is basically a flat pad, and not shaped like your foot, it offers zero support, and frankly, precious little cushioning. Whatever benefits it does offer won't last long because common insoles can wear down quickly. Just how quickly depends upon the person, the shoe and the use. 
<P>An <A HREF="yousay.html"><I>orthotic</I></A> (more properly called an orthosis, yet popularly referred to as an orthotic) is a shoe insert molded to the shape of your foot. It provides support, shock absorption and other benefits. In a word, what separates an insole from an orthotic is simply the degree of sophistication. That's where the confusion begins.
<P>Virtually every shoe comes with a preloaded or factory inserted insole. In years gone by, too often these have been worthless bits of flat latex padding. But in an effort to create better fitting and better performing shoes, manufacturers have substantially upgraded their insoles. Today's leading shoe companies, such as Ecco, Lowell, Mephisto, Nike, Rockport and SAS are preloading souped-up molded insoles that provide metatarsal and heel support, moisture and odor resistance, that dissipate shock and that are indeed a technologic marvel considering the recent history of factory provided devices. The cost to you is ostensibly free because the insoles are included in the shoes. But smart shoppers know that no company adds a high-tech insole without folding the cost into the overall cost of the shoe. But it's worth it.
<P>The next step in the orthotic continuum are over-the-counter (OTC) customizable insoles and even OTC orthotics, such as those sold by Pedifix, Johnson & Johnson and Spenco. These companies have a great deal of medical experience, but they have made everyman versions of their product for the retail market. Cost is anywhere from $5 for a low-end Dr. Scholl's to about $6 for a very usable Pedifix Pump Pal to about $10 for Johnson & Johnson's Specialist and about $20 for a top-of-the-line Spenco device with a heat-moldable plastic shell augmented by a soft top cover.
<P>Once you graduate from the OTC retail marketplace, the devices are referred to as "orthotics" or "orthoses" because a doctor or other practitioner--such as a podiatrist, pedorthist or physical therapist--fits a carefully selected device to your foot and customizes it. It is not just a shoe insert, but part of the treatment or management of your condition, or an attempt to avoid acquiring one as a result of your particular workstyle, lifestyle or play-style. Often, these practitioners are working with a prefabricated or ready-to-use device, adding and subtracting from its shape until it's just right. Cost is anywhere from $10 to $125, depending upon the quality of the prefab, your medical condition, the amount of work your practitioner does and even your area of the country. 
<P>At the far end of the continuum are custom orthotics derived from a three-dimensional impression of your foot rendered in plaster or foam, or possibly via laser scanning or digitizing. Custom orthotics are sophisticated medical products requiring a high degree of biomechanical skill and, again, are specifically designed and modified for your individual condition and use. Cost: generally anywhere from $100 to $500, and like the prefab, the cost is completely dependent upon the medical complications, the type of practitioner, your geographic locale and often what your insurance dictates.
<P>To complicate matters with progress, the same laboratories that make America's most sophisticated and costly doctor-prescribed custom orthotics have responded to the pressures of managed care by marketing simplified, less expensive versions of their devices. This new genre of customizable prefabricated orthotics represents a great deal of medical and manufacturing know-how, married to the economic and demographic realities of the day. They are compromises, but often good compromises.
<P>What results from the simple stuff getting complicated and the complicated stuff getting simple is a set of categories often only the experts can distinguish. Orthotic terms are thrown around like low-calorie labels were until recent FDA regulations. In short, you must understand a lot just to ask the right questions. Here are some answers.

<H2>Rigid vs. Flexible vs. Accommodative</H2>

Doctors often divide orthotics into three categories: <I>rigid, flexible and accommodative.</I> Rigid orthotics are generally made of some form of hard plastic and are designed to control your foot. For example, a rigid device could prevent your step from turning in <I>(pronating)</I>.
<P>Flexible orthotics are as the name implies, made from more flexible material: either a lighter-weight plastic or composite, and sometimes even multiple layers of plastic and cushioning material such as Poron. 
<P>The third category is accommodative, which means soft and cushioning. These devices are often made for people who can't tolerate the harder species and/or who need protection for either diabetic, arthritic or other sensitive conditions.
<P>Although doctors and therapists in the biomechanics mainstream find it handy to pigeon-hole orthotics into one of these three groups, it's actually quite misleading. All orthotics are designed to bend under the weight of the human body. The material is important. But consider this: while a very thin piece of "rigid" plastic under the weight of a 115 lb. woman would indeed be quite stiff, that same device under a 230 lb. man would be quite flexible. Furthermore, there are very dense fabrications of accommodative EVA that are stiff enough to control the foot. 
<P>What's important is not the label, but the problem and the solution.

<H2>Self-Medication vs. Prescriptive</H2>

Many variables come into play when selecting and fitting an orthotic. What is your existing or potential foot problem? How does your step or activity pattern relate to your feet, ankles, knees, hips and back? What type of shoe will you be wearing--cross-trainers, dress shoes, high heels, flats, pumps, rugged walkers, ski boots? What kind of socks will you be wearing--nylons, thick or thin, gym socks, summer or winter wear? Is your shoe designed with extra vertical depth to accommodate an orthotic? When you plop that insert into your shoe, have you allowed for support where you need it? Or have you created a problem by inserting a device that only adds to the pressure on your foot? These questions require expert answers. 
<P>If the orthotic doesn't fit the shoe and sock combination, you may only be compressing your foot and worsening or creating a problem. Or, you may be doing absolutely nothing because the orthotic is not designed for the problem you have. 
<P>That's why choosing a retail insole is self-medication pure and simple. But so is buying aspirin, cough syrup or allergy medicine. It's a matter of degree. Starting out with a store-bought OTC customizable molded insole or orthotic is not a bad idea if you have mild symptoms, or want to experience the first level of beneficial effects of shock absorption, or if you are seeking pain relief. But be forewarned: the same OTC orthotic or insole can be offered to two people and they will each experience different results. One person may feel as if she is walking on clouds; the other may feel cramped and pained. 
<P>Don't be turned off because a simple OTC product didn't work--maybe the orthotic or insole just need fitting, or perhaps you need a different device altogether. For example, you may need an orthometric examination to discover a longer leg on one side, which can significantly affect how an orthotic is prescribed and constructed.
<P>That's why healthcare professionals are so important. The right ones have experience with orthotics. Do you need an orthotic, and if so, which one? Depending on the problem being treated, some of America's most prestigious orthopedic surgeons, podiatrists, pedorthists, physiatrists and physical therapists will work with an inexpensive OTC or prefabricated device. In other cases your doctor may insist on a custom set, giving you the benefit of custom foot therapy.
<P>The important thing is the fitting. Whether an OTC, doctor-provided prefabricated device or custom orthotic, if it isn't fitted to the person, the orthotic may due more harm than good. Can you fit yourself? Many do and quite successfully. But often you must liken the process to getting contact lenses. You can go for the inexpensive Express lenses--but you still need professional fitting. Otherwise, you're the blind leading the blind.
<P>Unquestionably, you will pay more for the practitioner's time and effort than if you go to the drugstore and choose for yourself. But that's the difference between getting self treatment and doctor treatment. Unfortunately, too often the doctor's advice will be colored by economic realities anyway. Can you <I>afford</I> a custom device? Will your insurance pay for it? In many cases, insurance excludes custom orthotics or dictates a price too low for anything but a prefabricated model.
<P>The automobile insurance industry created the chop shop industry by paying unconscionably low prices for body work, and forcing garages to install used car parts. Now the health insurance industry is doing the same to human body work. The trend shows up in everything from prosthetic legs to knee braces to orthotics. Some patients simply stand up for their own dignity and make their own decision. They pay for their own health, if they can, because it's worth it.
<P>In future issues, we'll discuss special orthotics for runners and diabetics. We'll take a look at the different materials that are available and how they might affect your foot. And, we'll address cost issues. 
<P>Sooner or later, you'll be making a decision about insoles or orthotics. When you do, knowledge <I>underfoot</I> will help you hit the ground running.

<P>Looking a bit like a giant shoebox, the <A HREF="http://www.magic.ca/mtarch/bsm.html">Bata Shoe Museum</A> opened recently in Toronto to rave reviews. The four-story building houses over 10,000 shoes from the sublime to the ridiculous, from Eskimo boots to John Lennon's Beatles boots. But the museum is far more than a collection of footwear. It is the story of human nature and ritual. The opening exhibition, "All About Shoes," explores the many facets of footwear--its evolution, its uses, the methods, materials, and tools of its manufacture 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n1/b2.jpg" WIDTH=76 HEIGHT=105 ALIGN="RIGHT">
and its place in our lives and imagination from prehistoric times to the present.
<P>The museum is the love child of Sonja Bata, who since the 1940's has collected shoes from all corners of the globe. Born in Switzerland, she married Thomas Bata, son of a well-known Czech shoe manufacturer who emigrated to Canada after World War II with his family enterprise. As 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n1/b3.jpg" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=99" ALIGN="LEFT">
Sonja's collection outgrew her private storage space, the family established the Bata Shoe Museum Foundation to manage the collection more professionally and create a center of knowledge on the role of footwear in the social and cultural life of mankind. 
<P>Now, in a building specifically designed to house this 
extraordinary collection, there is room to expand the foundation's educational functions. The museum sponsors research, field trips, seminars and workshops. This season expect lectures such as "Safe Steps: A History of Rubbers," and "Queens of Sole: Women and Shoemaking." For children there's a Cinderella puppet show and a hands-on slipper making workshop.
<P>The museum's ever-changing displays range from "One, Two, Buckle My Shoe,"<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n1/b5.jpg" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=91 ALIGN=RIGHT> an exhibition of original artwork 
in children's books about shoes, to "Heels on Wheels" which traces 200 years of roller skates to in-line blades through artifacts and visual materials. 
<P>"Inuit Boots: A Woman's Art" reflects Sonja's fascination with, and the foundation's years of research into, the shoemaking of indigenous Canadian Arctic dwellers. "The Gentle Step" offers detailed 19th century scenes, complete with 
costumes and furniture to explore women's shoe fashion 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n1/b4.jpg" WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=96 ALIGN="LEFT">
from the 19th century into the 20th.
<P>Anyone with a passion for shoes will want to make the pilgrimage to Toronto and perhaps support the efforts of the museum by becoming a member. 
<P><I>The Bata Shoe Museum is located at 327 Bloor St. W., Toronto, Ontario, Canada. For more information, call 416-979-7799. Look for photos of some of Bata's spectacular historical shoes in future issues of Stride.</I>

<H1>Welcome to Stride</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin and Elizabeth Black</I>
</CENTER>
<HR>
Think for a moment about how you abuse your feet during
an average day. Up and running around like crazy sometimes
before 6:00 am. Helping everyone get off to school and work before you yourself hit the rush hour. Spending much of the workday
on your feet in shoes that look a lot better than they feel.
Staying later than you intended at work to finish a project
or avert that crisis. Stopping for groceries on the way
home. Getting stuck in yet another line. So many of us walk
into our doors at the end of the day saying, "My feet are
killing me," or "My back is killing me," that an alien would
assume these were the common evening greetings on this
planet.
<P>Maybe it's time to start paying attention to the messages
your feet, legs and back are sending you.
<P>Get ready for a new movement. It's not a movement of art,
or politics. It's a movement of one. Your own physical
movement  from hip to toe. Welcome to <CITE>Stride Magazine</CITE>, the
first publication devoted to helping you walk, run and enjoy
healthier feet, ankles, legs, knees, hips and lower back.
<P><CITE>Stride</CITE> is unlike any health and fitness magazine you've
ever seen. Why? Because <CITE>Stride</CITE> is brought to you by the
editors of <CITE>BioMechanics Magazine</CITE>, the number one lower body
movement magazine read by orthopedists, podiatrists,
physical therapists, pedorthists, clinical athletic trainers
and a dozen other allied health specialities. As such, we
won't be serving up the fad medicine and illusory quick-fixes you 
may be accustomed to seeing on the newsstand.
Instead, <CITE>Stride</CITE> will deliver the same cutting edge medical
and fitness insights read by America's biomechanics
specialists every month.
<P>We have two goals: promote reader self-awareness and self
management, and help readers detect the right time to seek
health advice from the right professional. Expect <CITE>Stride</CITE> to
tell you the truth about insoles, ankles wraps and knee
braces; to explain when to apply hot and when to apply cold
therapy; how to become fit and stay fit; how to join the comfort shoe
revolution. You'll learn how to ensure that your workstyle, lifestyle and playstyle remain challenging and fulfilling, but safe.
<P>Our articles are authored by noted specialists in their
field, or by health journalists working with experts. For
example, in
this issue you'll see names such
as Carol Frey, MD (orthopedist specializing in women's shoe
issues); Lowell Scott Weil, DPM (podiatrist to the Chicago
Bears and Chicago White Sox); Ronald Grelsamer, MD (knee
expert); Peter C. Janes, MD (snowboarding injury specialist
from Vail, Colorado) and many others. Articles are reviewed
by a panel of experts to ensure medical accuracy.
<P>Advertising in <CITE>Stride</CITE> is also different. We won't
consciously run any advertising that we or our panel of
experts believe is not medically sound. It's
what you should expect from a magazine
primarily dispensed in doctors' offices, comfort shoe stores
as well as on
newsstands across America.
<P>If you're tired of choosing between looking good and
feeling good, if you understand that when your feet and legs
hurt your whole body suffers, if you care about your health--
and your family's--but distrust a lot of the information
floating around the newsstands, then you are indeed ready
for a new movement.
<P>We hope to do all this with a sense of humor, and a dose
of humility. We won't scold you for wearing those special
high heels to your daughter's wedding. But we may help you
figure out how to cope the next day. We won't castigate you
for skipping your 35 minutes of walking for the last three
days. But we will try to help motivate you to take better
care of yourself.
<P>Furthermore, <CITE>Stride</CITE> aims to help you hit your stride with
style and grace. When asked to define "American style,"
Grace Mirabella, the thinking woman's guru of fashion,
surprised her colleagues with this vision. "American style,"
she said, "is a comfortable, active, unencumbered life It's
filled with a spirit of mobility, a spirit of freedom."
<CITE>Stride</CITE> will be there to promote your mobility and freedom.

<H2>Personal Area Networks</H2>
No it's not another story about the Internet, but it does have to do with computers and, if you can believe it, shoes. It seems that a group of engineers from MIT and IBM have redefined the term "mobile computing." What began as Tom Zimmerman's thesis project at MIT is now known as the Personal Area Network (PAN), which is--and we're not making this up--an in-shoe computer that would make Maxwell Smart green with envy. 
<P>The concept is surprisingly simple. Take a $3 microprocessor, a couple of electrodes, throw it in a shoe and you're wired. As you ambulate, you generate energy, powering your onboard computer.
<P>Now let's say you're shmoozing at a cocktail party, and the guy you've just met thinks you'd be perfect for the opening in his firm. Assuming he's wired at the foot just like you, you'd simply shake hands, establishing a low-voltage (we're talking a millionth of an amp) wireless connection from your shoe to his. He'd later upload your vital statistics, anything from your name and number to a digital photo or video clip.
<P>And while it may be some time before this stuff goes mainstream, Zimmerman has no doubt that the technology will have real applications. "I like to think," he says wistfully, "that Dr. Scholl's will be the next PC distributor."

<H2>Just Do It!</H2>
For years now, the American Heart Association and the Centers for Disease Control have advocated an "active lifestyle" as a means to combat coronary heart disease based largely on studies involving only male subjects.
<P>Recently, however, a group of researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle released a study indicating that even modest amounts of physical activity during leisure time can reduce by almost half the risk of heart attack among postmenopausal women. Women who engage in some meaningful form of physical activity, such as walking 30-45 minutes three times a week, derive the maximum benefit. The take home message is: just do it.

<H2>Big Foot</H2>
At 6 ft. 6 inches and 280 lbs., Joey Frazier casts an imposing shadow, especially for a kid who's only in the eleventh grade. Those familiar with him on and off the football field at Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland, think he may just have a future in pro football. But Joey and his mom have a more immediate concern, specifically footwear. Not to be outdone by the rest of his body, Joey's feet are now 13 1/2 inches long and 5 1/4 inches wide, which translates to a size 20EEE shoe.
<P>Primarily due to cost, but also to availability, Frazier has been forced to play football in the same pair of size 19 Reeboks since the middle of his freshman year. And because dress shoes of that size must be special- ordered at approximately $400 a pair, Joey has gone without, and is beginning to wonder what he'll do come prom time.
<P>Following several recent stories in the local press, Joey caught the attention of such companies as Nike and Reebok who tried but, short of spending thousands of dollars on a custom mold, were stumped. Then things began to happen. Orlando Magic star Shaquille O'Neal's personal assistant got wind of Joey's plight, and promised that O'Neal, who wears a size 22 shoe, would donate a pair of his custom-made Reeboks and a pair of Shaq's own dress shoes. Then a local athletic shoe-store owner volunteered to cast Joey's feet, from which inexpensive dress shoes could be made. Next thing you know, Nike announced that two anonymous donors had offered to 
pay for custom football cleats, but 
they'd wait until June to fit Frazier just in case his feet decide they're not finished growing.

<H2>Booming Revolution</H2>
Baby boomers--all 76 million of them--have given us everything from frozen quiche to the Beatles '95. Which boomer accomplishments will stand out as the most enduring of the group born from 1946 to 1964? Some point to the campaign demanding more respect for their feet. Why?
<P> "With the tremendous number of boomers aging," says George Whalin, president of California-based Retail Management Consultants, "their priorities are less fashion oriented. Whereas you'd give up comfort for fashion when you were 25, you don't do that when you are 50." And because their collective purchasing power is what it is, boomers are a principal force driving the marketplace. Indeed, says Whalin, "they <I>are</I> the marketplace." 
<P>Comfort shoes <I>per se</I> aren't necessarily a new breed. What is new, however, is the degree to which footwear manufacturers have begun to incorporate comfort features into their mainstream lines of fashion footwear. National Shoe Retailers Association (NSRA) President Bill Boettge confirms the shift. "Vendors are telling me that if a shoe isn't comfortable, it's hard to sell." 
<P>Even footcare related companies like Schering-Plough, <I>aka</I> Dr. Scholl's, report a surge in demand for its products, which they attribute to aging baby  boomers.
<P>Regardless of who's responsible for this shift, the bottom line is clear. Boomers may have started it, but society overall will reap the benefits. Now if they can just do something about the deficit.


<H2>Paralympics</H2>
So what's the second largest sporting event in the world? You're forgiven if you answer the World Series, Super Bowl or World Cup soccer--huge events to be sure--but relatively small potatoes compared to the Paralympic Games in numbers of participants and events. 
<P>And while you still may not fully grasp its scope, organizers of the 1996 Paralympic Games in Atlanta are spending $100 million to ensure that come August 16, you know exactly what these games are all about.
<P>To say that the Paralympics are merely disabled athletes competing against one another is to miss the point. Indeed the level at which many of these 4,000-plus athletes perform is staggering. Athletes such as Joe Gaetani, a double leg amputee, have set records far beyond their able-bodied counterparts. During the '92 Paralympic Games in Barcelona, Gaetani's time in the men's 100-meter sprint came in just two seconds shy of world record holder Carl Lewis.
<P>But since the games traditionally come two weeks after the able-bodied Olympics, Paralympic publicity tends to get lost in the noise. That's why this year's Paralympic organizers are pulling out all of the stops, not the least of which is an in-your-face ad campaign sure to catch your eye.

<H2>Bathe your feet in Ahava (love)</H2>
<BR>Pamper someone you love with a Foot Spa gift basket from the mineral-rich Dead Sea. Ahava (Hebrew for love) skin care products are manufacturered at Mizpeshalem kibbutz on the banks of the Dead Sea, the lowest point on earth and the site where King Solomon lavished the Queen of Sheba with unspecified "gifts" from these healing waters. The Foot Spa gift basket features Dead Sea salts and aromatic, softening oils to add to hot water for a soothing 20-minute soak; plus a foot cream containing moisture-revitalizing minerals such as potassium, calcium and magnesium. The foot cream also contains camphor for its healing properties and teatree oil, a natural disinfectant, according to Brett Goldberg, president of Ahava, USA. The foot cream is to be massaged into the feet and legs until absorbed and is soothing enough to be used directly after shaving or waxing. Look for Ahava products at Saks, Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom. Or call <B>1-800-25-AHAVA</B> to locate the distributor nearest you.

<H2>Of Mice and more</H2>
The coziest slippers to get you through this winter come from Haflinger of Germany and feature boiled wool uppers. Children's models range from a 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n1/mice.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=128 ALIGN="RIGHT">
mischievous mouse to scary green monsters. The adult clog-style slippers feature more sedate colors with braid trim.
<P>Boiled wool, a material popular for 30 years in Europe, is created by a complex procedure of boiling, heating and cooling, imbuing the wool with a felt-like character that is shrink-proof, machine washable, soft and pliable. It's a breathable, natural insulator perfect for keeping feet toasty on cold mornings. Since the cork insoles mold to your feet, they're also great for walking and standing. Unlike the flimsy slippers you may have schlumped about the house in last winter, Haflinger clog slippers will support your feet as you go about your weekend household chores. For more information, call the USA distributor, Gerda Hoehm at <B>1-800-515-9225.</B>

<H2>Get a grip on yourself</H2>
Nobody likes to lose their footing, especially when walking on winter's icy surfaces. Get-A-Grip may be the only accessory you'll need this winter to promote a safe walk in the snow, sleet, rain, solid ice or whatever else Mother Nature sends your way.
<P>Get-A-Grip is actually a second rubber sole for your shoes that uses six replaceable carbide spikes, like crampons, for traction. Easily pulled on, Get-A-Grip stretches over your shoes or boots like a harness without using straps, buttons or fasteners. For a distributor near you call Sure Foot Corporation at <B>1-800-772-3668.</B>

<H2>Rubz away the pain</H2>
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n1/ball.jpg" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=82 ALIIGN="LEFT">
For centuries, the Chinese have been practicing reflexology, a theory that 
involves stimulating nerve endings in the feet to relieve pain and tension in other parts of the body. Now Foot Rubz brings the theory down to earth. Shaped like a ball, and sold in a variety of colors, Foot Rubz 
features protruding rubber knobs that stimulate acu-points. Roll your foot over the ball and feel the tension release. Contact Sure Foot Corporation at <B>1-800-778-3668</B> for more information.

<H2>Shocking legs</H2>
From Italy, Oroblu hosiery delivers an elegant, high fashion look while reducing the fatigue of tired legs. Their <I>Repos 70</I> line features a system of graded compression from the ankle to the upper thigh, creating a massage effect along the leg muscles. Oroblu's <I>Silhouette 20</I> is also "permanently" hypoallergenic, enabling women who cannot wear hosiery due to allergies or foot fungus problems, to wear fashionable support. But wait, great feel doesn't have to be boring!
<P>Enter <I>Shock Up,</I> a just-released, shockingly sexy hosiery, that's selling like hotcakes in Europe and is due in Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and Saks early this year. "Shock Up," says Tara Thomson, who imports Oroblu products to the U.S., "offers comfortable support for the active woman who follows fashion trends and is now asking for a perfect figure." The secret, according to Thomson, is an improved top of elastic strips, which shapes hips and thighs and lifts the bottom to make the waist slimmer and level the tummy. Shock Up also includes the graded compression support and hypoallergenic features. If you can't find Oroblu hosiery near you, call <B>212-768-7424.</B>

<H2>Stick 'em in the dryer</H2>
Designed by outdoorsman Dennis Crooks to dry out hiking boots and ski boots, Miracle Dry, a sort of hair dryer for shoes, circulates dry air (not heat which can damage shoes) with the help of a set of two plastic tubes and a small three-speed fan. Crooks is working on a battery-operated model for hikers to take on the trail. Each 18-inch tube fits into a shoe. Call New Stuff, Inc., at <B>1-800-679-9179</B> for retailers in your area.

<H2>Swimmer's ear</H2>
Spenco's underwater radio, the Surf Runner is looking to even the playing field. Runners have a slew of portable radios to use while working out and now there's one that swimmers can use underwater.
<P>The bite-size radio uses a clip for attachment and has a hi/lo button for volume and two scan buttons for tuning control. The radio gets good reception and avoids annoying static by jumping to only strong-signaled stations. More importantly, it holds up to the turbulence of swimming.

<H1>Reinventing the Heel</H1>
<I>by Annette Tapert</I> 
</CENTER>

<P>The stiletto is back. The shoe that, in a pinch, can double as 
a weapon has returned with a vengeance. Chalk up another defeat for classical feminism.
<P>I wore these shoes when they were last the rage, more than a decade ago. And I can show you my souvenirs: bunions. Still, when I see today's models in spikes, I grow nostalgic. The shoes look sexy, providing a needed insouciance for today's smart, fitted suits.
<P>Never mind how many heels I've mutilated negotiating subway grates, 
potholes and other obstacles the city presents to a woman walking five inches off the ground. How can I possibly forget the 1979 cobblestoned-street episode in London? There I was, artfully maneuvering across the rocky surface, when I found myself perched on an unusually high stone. As I struggled to keep my 
balance, someone shouted, "Look, she's going to commit suicide by jumping off her stilettos." I broke into laughter, lost my footing and landed on my rear.
<P>I was in London "finding myself" in those days. Each morning, I got myself properly dressed for success in the workplace. That meant clomping around in shoes that offered no more support than pick-up-sticks. It also meant the kind of low, raw aching back pain that made each step feel as if knives-stilettos?-were being drilled into my sacroiliac.
<P>So as I happily hiked home from the latest New York fashion shows in my chic Robert Clergerie walking shoes, I muttered, "Never again!" But in matters of fashion, "never" means "soon." It's a merry-go-round, and if you're seduced by its charms, you will inevitably be snared in the latest cycle.
<P>The pain of stilettos is like the pain of giving birth--how quickly one forgets. I was shopping in Paris recently and spied a delicious cocktail dress. I couldn't get the full drama of the creation in my low pumps, so the saleswoman produced a pair of T-strap satin stilettos. Voila! The dress and I were transformed. "You see Madame, it's just a matter of proportion," I was told. "Will you be buying the shoes?"
<P><I>"Bien sur! Absolument!</I>" I console myself with the thought that fashion now has shorter cycles.

<H2>Should my knee hurt following exercise?</H2>
In a word "No." There are many popular exercise routines and machines which, in some cases, can cause pain. Whether that pain results from, say, aerobic exercise or weight training, is not the point. Regardless of its apparent cause, knee pain should 
be viewed as an indication that something is amiss. Indeed the old adage "no pain, no gain," is just that, old! In many cases, pain is a by-product of inflamed tissue. If  you experience pain following some form of exercise, cease and desist for a day or 
two. If, after you've resumed your workout, the pain persists, don't push it. Listen to the very clear signal your body is sending you and consult a physician. 

<H2>What exactly does the knee cap do?</H2>
When Olympic skater Nancy Kerrigan was struck in the knee cap, people could literally relate to the pain she felt. Many practitioners agree that the knee cap is a common source of pain among young and old. Overall, however, the knee cap performs two major tasks: it protects that intersection known as the knee-where the femur and tibia (thigh and shin bones) meet-from undue trauma; and more significantly, it functions as part of a complex lever as you bend and straighten your leg. Although some 
people can function without a knee cap, others feel weakness in their knee without it. When a knee cap is removed, thigh muscles must compensate. Indeed in light of its role, patellectomies (removal of the knee cap) have become far less popular in recent 
years.

<H2>What effect do the feet have upon the knee?</H2>
The ankle bone is connected to the shin bone in more than one way. When your feet aren't functioning properly, this connection can be thrown out of whack, impacting the entire leg and back. If, for example, you suffer from fallen arches, your feet will tend to pronate, or turn inwards, causing the knee to twist-enough in some cases to cause pain. When this occurs, your first line of defense should be footwear with built-in arch support. Most running shoes fit the bill, as do some casual and dress shoe
s. Seek out a knowledgeable shoe salesperson and don't be shy about asking. If the added support fails to address the problem, custom arch supports or orthotics may be called for.

<H2>Does knee arthritis automatically lead to knee replacement?</H2>
Your knee hurts and perhaps you aren't as young as you used to be. You're shown an x-ray indicating arthritis and your doctor automatically recommends surgery. Are there any alternatives? It's a medical truism that you "treat patients, not x-rays." Arthritic pain can be quite severe, but it tends to wax and wane. And while surgery can provide relief for some, in others it can lead to complications, often negating the benefits of surgery. Knee replacement should be a last resort, pursued only when all 
reasonable forms of  non-operative treatment have failed. With this approach, you will have a better sense of the benefits derived from knee replacement if and when it becomes necessary.

<H2>What does it mean when my knees make cracking or popping noises?</H2>
Most joints have the ability to crack, and the knee is no exception. Partially consisting of tendons and ligaments, the knee often behaves like a biological rubber band of varying tensions. Just as a rubber band will "twang" when stretched and released, so do tendons as they expand and contract. That's just one explanation. It is also believed that small amounts of gas can accumulate in a joint. As the joint bends, tiny gas bubbles burst, producing the popping noise you often hear. Finally there is crepitus, a crunching noise that can be quite loud. Although its exact source is not certain, some attribute crepitus to an inflamed joint lining, while others speculate that it may result from abnormal softening of cartilage within the knee cap.
<P>In all cases, you need not worry about painless noises. A painful noise, however, should be investigated if it continues unabated.

Grelsamer, MD, is chief of Hip and Knee Surgery at Maimonides Medical Center in New York City and staff orthopedic surgeon at Beth Israel North and the Hospital for Joint Diseases in New York.

<H1>Take a Load Off Your Feet</H1>

<P><I>by Diana Tonnessen</I>
</CENTER>
<P>You've heard it before: carrying around extra pounds increases your risk of a host of health problems: heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and certain types of cancer. But did you know that excess weight exacts a heavy toll on your feet and lower extremities as well?
<P>Overweight women are at an increased risk of developing certain foot problems, including heel pain (plantar fasciitis), inflamed arches, tendinitis, foot fractures and sprains. This according to a recent study by Carol Frey, MD, associate clinical professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Southern California School of Medicine in Los Angeles. 
<P>Although formal studies of obesity are scant, the medical literature is filled with evidence that excess weight dramatically interferes with the kinetic chain and general biomechanics. Your low back, hips and knees are vulnerable. For example, overweight people are 18 times more likely to have osteoarthritis of both knees compared to people of normal weight, according to former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, director of the nonprofit national consumer education program, Shape Up America. 
<P>Other studies have documented that being overweight can affect the way you walk, slowing your gait and possibly causing your feet to turn outward (out-toeing), which may further strain the lower extremities. Unless you have diabetes, and your weight has a direct bearing on your diabetes control, none of these problems are life-threatening per se. But they can certainly affect the quality of your life. 
<P>Of course, there are plenty of other compelling reasons to be concerned about your weight. One of the most recent: a September 1995 study published in the prestigious <CITE>New England Journal of Medicine</CITE>, which involved some 115,000 women, found that those with the lowest mortality weighed 15 percent less than the average American woman today. The take-home message: lower weights are associated with better health and a longer life.
<P>And yet, these findings are released at a time when more Americans than ever before are considered "overweight." Some 32 million women and 26 million men--roughly one-third of the U.S. population--are considered overweight by one or more criteria. What's more, according to recent government surveys, Americans' waistlines are expanding measurably: The average body weight of U.S. adults has increased by 7.9 lbs. during the past 15 years. Women are more likely to have weight problems than men. Some ethnic and minority groups are more likely than others to have trouble with their weight both because of genetic and sociological factors. 
<P>Losing weight not only improves overall health and produces a better self image, it leads to  better lower body biomechanics; that is, better walking, running, and general lower body motion. The problem is, too many doctors are willing to treat the biomechanical effects of being overweight--pain and dysfunction in the low back, knees and feet--but are reluctant to offend their overweight but non-obese patients with the truth about that extra 30 lbs. That means patients and consumers must take the initiative to check their personal weight against the national standards and then consider their overall lower body comfort and function. Solicit your doctor's view and discover the impact your weight is having on your particular biomechanical profile. If you're overweight, it's time for a change that will improve the way you move and feel. 
<P>The imperative to lose weight is easy to say, tough to do. But if most weight loss diets don't work, what does work? There's no mystery: eat less, do more. Here are practical steps to improve your odds and add a biomechanical leg up.

<H2>Start with a Healthy Attitude</H2> 
What exactly is a "healthy attitude?" Perhaps the most important component is a willingness to make long term changes in your eating and exercise habits. Successful weight management is not about diligently depriving yourself on a six-week crash diet and then returning to your old eating habits (often with a vengeance), points out Neva Cochran, RD, a registered dietitian in Dallas, Texas and spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. Rather, it's about adopting sensible eating and exercise habits that are easy enough and enjoyable enough to incorporate into your life for the rest of your life.  
<P>Your motivation for losing weight is also part of a healthy attitude that will ultimately help you succeed. Don't try to lose weight because somebody else wants you to. Do it because you want to. Also, try not to think of weight loss as a solution to all your problems. Instead, realize that by losing weight successfully, you'll feel more self-confident and empowered. 
<P>Timing is vital. If you are already under a lot of stress at work or at home, you may want to put off your plans to lose weight until you are better able to cope with the demands of a weight loss regimen.
<P>Finally, take some time to prepare yourself mentally for making the behavioral changes you'll need to lose weight. In the weeks before you start your new eating and exercise plan, it might help to keep a food diary to pinpoint when, what, why and how much you normally eat, and under what circumstances you overeat. Most importantly, separate food and eating from your emotions.  
<P>Weight reduction is a formidable challenge. If you slip up now and then, use the experience as a learning opportunity to develop better strategies for the future rather than viewing it as a sure sign you should give up for good. 

<H2>Set Realistic Goals</H2>
Set realistic and attainable goals. Sometimes, this means rethinking your meaning of "success." Success doesn't necessarily mean reaching a weight that's considerably lower than you can realistically maintain. Or that you must lose weight so rapidly that you become a new person "overnight." Maybe you lose a little weight initially while learning new eating and exercise behaviors, and save the serious weight reduction for later on. (See <A HREF="/stride/v1n2/loadoffsb2.html">How Much Should You Weigh?</A>). A reasonable weight loss, one that can usually be maintained for long periods of time, is 1/2 lb. to 1 lb. per week. Whatever goal you set, it should be reasonable for you. And it probably should be worked out with the help of a professional--either a registered dietitian or a member of the biomechanics mainstream, such as a clinical athletic trainer, sports orthopedist or other clinician (see <A HREF="/stride/v1n2/guide.html">Who Can Help</A>).

<H2>Eat Sensibly</H2>
If the foods you eat to lose weight are so radically different from what you are normally accustomed to eating, you won't be able to maintain either the eating habits or the weight loss over the long haul, says Cochran. This is particularly true of fad diets that exclude entire food groups. Such diets become monotonous and boring. They also shortchange you nutritionally. Moreover, the destructive eating patterns often associated with crash dieting--weeks of food deprivation usually followed by as many or more weeks of binge eating--could evolve into full blown eating disorders. Remember, any eating plan must be flexible enough to allow you to enjoy a variety of foods in diverse settings, such as restaurants and other peoples' homes. 
<P>A good starting place for meal planning is the USDA's Food Pyramid. The Food Pyramid is built on a base of grains, fruits and vegetables, rising up to moderate amounts of lean meat and low-fat dairy products. Fats and sweets (including alcohol), are to be used sparingly because, explains Cochran, "these foods have a concentrated amount of calories with few nutrients."

<HR>
But can a diet based largely on starchy foods, such as potatoes, rice, pasta and breads actually help you to lose weight? Yes, provided you choose items from this food group that are low in fat (a bagel instead of a biscuit, for instance, or a slice of whole wheat bread instead of a croissant), and provided you don't smother them with high-fat toppings such as cream cheese, and provided you eat them in moderation along with other low-fat foods, namely plenty of fruits and vegetables. Complex carbohydrates have a lot going for them. Gram for gram, carbohydrates have far fewer calories than fat. Compare 4 calories per carbohydrate gram vs. 9 calories per fat gram. In fact, some people find that by switching to a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet they can actually eat somewhat more food without changing their overall calorie intake. 
<P>Foods high in carbohydrates have another key nutrient that high-fat foods generally lack: dietary fiber, believed to help reduce the risk of heart disease and certain cancers, and possibly to promote weight loss. In a recent study at the University of Sydney in Australia, foods high in fiber were found to be more filling than high fat foods such as doughnuts, candies and cakes. High-fiber foods also provided more hunger satisfaction, which helps decrease the desire to nibble between meals.
<P>Cutting back on high-calorie, high-fat foods may not be as difficult as you would imagine. Two prime areas to target: whole dairy products and meats. Enjoy a substantial fat savings simply by switching from whole dairy products to low-fat or no-fat dairy products. For instance, one-cup of whole milk contains a hefty 8 grams of fat, compared to 2.6 grams for the same amount of one percent low-fat milk and less than 1/2 gram for skim milk. "There's a low fat or skim milk version of every dairy product on the market," says Cochran. 
<P>As for meats, choose the leanest cuts of meat, such as round or loin of beef, trim all visible fat before cooking and prepare them in ways that don't add a lot of fat: broiling or baking rather than frying. Opt for chicken and fish and of course eliminate all the skin. 
<P>Most importantly, cut back on portions. A three-ounce portion of meat (about the size of a deck of playing cards) is now considered standard. "You can still have your favorite foods," says Cochran, "but just in smaller amounts." Indeed, practicing portion control is vital for all food groups. Eating large amounts of any foods--even so-called "healthy" or low fat foods--will promote weight gain. 
<P>At first, it may be a good idea to measure your food for a week or two to get a better idea of what a half-cup serving of rice or a three-ounce portion of meat really looks like. You'd be amazed how small it is and how large a portion you're generally consuming. Also, avoid serving foods "family style," in which foods are placed in large help-yourself-to-seconds serving dishes right in front of you on the table. Serve the portion you need to eat, no more.
<P>Don't fall into the trap of counting fat grams without also counting calories. "Just because a food is labeled 'fat-free' doesn't mean it is calorie free," says Cochran. In fact, by cutting the portion size so the fat content is just under 1 gram, food makers can label their product as "fat free." But eating four small cookies, each with a half-gram of fat, means 2 real fat grams. That's not fat free. And the pure calories mount up. For instance, one slender "fat-free" fig cookie contains less than 1 gram of fat, but a hefty 100 calories. Remember, regardless of the source, excess unused calories are ultimately stored as fat. 
<P>Sometimes, overeating is a result of eating too fast or on the run. Dr. Art Ulene of NBC's <CITE>Today</CITE> show advises waiting 30 seconds between swallows. This simple diet trick has helped many people lose weight.
<P>Finally, don't forget to drink plenty of water--eight 8 ounce glasses per day--not because water has magical weight-loss properties, but because you need water to stay well-hydrated and prevent constipation. Water will fill you up. It is your number one diet food.

<H2>Exercise Regularly</H2> 
Don't forget to count the calories you burn during exercise. Yes, increasing your activity is a must. No, you do not have to be like Oprah Winfrey and start running marathons to lose weight. But you do have to increase your level of activity on a regular basis, says Susie Kania, MS, exercise physiologist with the Cooper Wellness Program, part of the prestigious Cooper Aerobics Center in Dallas, Texas. Ideally, this means increasing your heart rate to a "working level" for 20 to 30 minutes five to seven days a week. Almost any activity will do--even gardening, yard work and housework can be counted as exercise if performed vigorously. 
<P>You should be aware that there is some controversy about how long your exercise sessions should be to encourage weight loss. Some researchers have suggested that long exercise sessions consisting of low-impact endurance activities, such as walking, are best because the body is forced to use fat stored in adipose tissues to fuel this kind of sustained activity. Others contend that a calorie is a calorie, and it doesn't matter which fuel source the body uses--sugars stored in the muscles, or fat. "If weight loss is a goal, what you want to do is burn calories," says Kania. "And while intensity and time are important, if you don't have 20 to 30 minutes, then just do a few minutes of some activity." Kania and other experts (including current guidelines from the American College of Sports Medicine) say the 20-30 minutes of increased activity does not have to be consecutive; it can be cumulative--a 10-minute burst of activity here, another 10 minutes there. The important thing is to become more active. So don't throw your hands up in despair if you can't find 30 minutes of uninterrupted time in your day to exercise.
<P>One idea: plan a 10-minute daily walk for your first week, then gradually increase the time by five minutes each week until you hit a stride of brisk 30-minute walks. (See <A HREF="/stride/v1n2/walkoff.html">Walk It Off</A>). 
<P>Keep track of your progress in an exercise diary in which you record the date, activity, distance and duration, and your heart rate. Finding an exercise partner to keep you motivated is a great idea, but make sure your partner doesn't slow you down.

<H2>Think Small</H2>
It's not necessary to make major changes in your eating and exercise habits overnight. In fact, it's not even recommended. Trying to make too many lifestyle changes too rapidly could put an early end to an earnest effort. Instead, plan to phase in your new eating and exercise habits over a period of weeks or even months. Remember: Small changes can make a big difference. 
<P>For instance, says Cochran, instead of trying to change your eating habits 180 degrees in one day, try eating one low-fat meal a day, keeping everything else the same. 
<P>The same "think small" strategies hold true for moving toward a more active lifestyle. If you can't exercise in a big way right now, look for little ways to increase your activity: Take the stairs instead of the elevator at work; park your car a few blocks from the office and walk at least part of the way to work; walk or ride your bicycle to the store instead of driving. Even playing with your children counts as physical activity if the activity is strenuous enough to raise your heart rate. And it's fun!
<P>The point is, says Cochran, "change does not have to be dramatic to be successful."

<H2>Enlist the Help and Support of Others</H2>
It's not easy to change your eating and exercise habits. One reason Oprah Winfrey was wildly successful in her latest weight loss effort is that she had plenty of help: a professional chef who cooked all her meals and a personal trainer who motivated her to exercise. You'll need lots of help and support, too, from family, friends, co-workers, even medical professionals. 
<P>Can't afford to hire a chef? Invest in some good cookbooks and use them as a guide for planning your meals. (Don't forget to set aside time in your schedule for meal planning, too. It's a must.) Or try visiting a registered dietitian, who can help design healthy meal plans for you and your family. (For a referral to an RD in your area, call the ADA's toll-free consumer information line: <B>800-366-1655.</B>)
<P>Other good sources of support include reputable group weight loss programs, such as Weight Watchers or Taking Off Pounds Sensibly (TOPS) (check your phone directory for a local affiliate). Beware of pay-as-you-go weight loss clinics, however. Some may be more interested in fattening up their bottom line than trimming your waistline.
<P>Perhaps the most important thing about managing your weight is to accept that it's going to take some time and effort, but you can do it, and you'll feel better for it. So just do it. One step at a time.

<H1>The Stride Guide to Walking Shoes</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+2>We picked dozens of our favorite walking shoes to help you maximize your walking experience, whether it's a pleasure stroll around the neighborhood or a fitness walk for cardiovascular high.</FONT>
<P><I>by Edwin and Elizabeth Black</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Now that good weather has finally arrived, walking is back on the agenda. Walks come in all sizes and shapes. Maybe it's a five minute walk around the block in the morning air before work just to start the day right. Or maybe it's a 10-minute break in the fresh air just when the office starts driving you crazy. Perhaps it's a two-hour weekend exploration along the nature trails or a fast-paced 60-minute walk down the fitness lanes between the joggers and bicyclists. Whether you walk as a distraction, for fitness, to tour and explore, or to woo someone's heart, you'll want to maximize your joy, comfort and benefit--and that's impossible without the right shoes. Wearing the wrong shoes can make the experience punishing and painful. The right pair can make the walk a pleasure, offering great physical, social and emotional rewards. 
<P>That's why Stride created its selective Guide to Walking Shoes, a reflection of a dozen of our personal favorites. First understand what our Guide isn't. It isn't a guide to comfort shoes, hiking shoes, occupational shoes or a myriad of other shoe categories. These shoes are meant for walking. Walking is a very specific form of biomechanics and therefore requires a shoe designed for that purpose. Until recently, walking shoes (as opposed to hiking or athletic shoes) was a sparse class. A few years ago, people mostly walked in athletic shoes. Rockport led the way with well-built shoes specifically designed and marketed for the walking phenomenon. American comfort and European manufacturers began to target the market as well. Now there's an explosion of walking models.
<P>Walking shoes are different. They must be designed for walking's specific heel-to-toe biomechanics. That means more protection and engineering for heel strike and more emphasis on a solid platform of roomy comfort and support. It also means creating a shoe that will serve walkers of all ages: from grandchild to grandparent.
<P>Our selection spans the walking gamut from a light meandering stroll wearing the Ecco Walker to a serious fitness walk wearing the Wilson Technical Walker. Space did not permit us to include all the shoes we like. No attempt at comprehensiveness is made. We wish the list could be three times as long. But this selective guide will give you a starting point in your quest for the right shoe for the right type of walk at the right price. Hopefully, you will acquire a variety of walking shoes that will suit wherever your mood, pace and destination take you.
<P>How we chose our dozen favorites is not that dissimilar to how you should choose them in a store. First, each of the shoes had to exemplify quality shoe design and construction. We looked for engineering, design innovation, a knowledgeable use of materials, removable insoles, multilayered shock absorption and support, roomy last, and of course an understanding of how a shoe must act and react to make it a walking shoe. In addition, every shoe had to be available in multiple lengths and widths, either using the American standard of lengths and widths or the Eurocomfort approach with gradations of size.
<P>But then a very personal process took over during wear testing. That process was dictated by the personal fit of the shoe and the architecture of our feet. Men's shoes were mostly reviewed by Edwin who has a very wide and flat foot. Women's shoes were mostly reviewed by Elizabeth who has a hard to fit high arch. Some shoes Edwin loved were terribly uncomfortable for Elizabeth. For example, Edwin loved the Wilson Technical Walker. Liz hated it, even after trying its special insole enhancer for arch supports. On the other hand, our 11-year-old daughter, who has daddy's wide foot, also loved the Wilson.
<P>In some cases, Elizabeth insisted upon elevating a favorite comfort shoe to light walker status, such as the Soft Spots Supremes. Edwin did the same with the Ecco Walker which he uses fundamentally as a comfort shoe. The most important features we considered were comfort, support and shock management at an affordable price.

<P><B>Easy Spirit Journey</B>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe1.jpg" WIDTH=217 HEIGHT=100>
<P>Good, solid comfort without any bells and whistles. These walking shoes got me up and down Mt. Sinai last summer in searing 115-degree heat. Shock absorption is provided by a dual-density flexible lightweight EVA midsole and a dual-density rubber outsole. The contoured removable insole can be washed, and/or replaced. The toebox is roomy, there's extra width in the ball of the foot, the heel collar is snug, padded and cuddly soft--in short, it's designed for a woman's foot. The array of fitting combinations--with five widths,  and in sizes ranging from 4 to 13--make it a godsend for hard-to-fit feet. 
<P><I>Women's sizes. Widths: AAA, AA, B, D, EE.  Size range: 4-13.</I>   


<P><B>Easy Spirit Inspiration</B> 
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe2.jpg" WIDTH=229 HEIGHT=100>
<P>Inspiration is the new and improved big sister of Journey. Like the Easy Spirit Journey, the Inspiration offers good shock absorption, support and durability. It adds features such as a Dri-Lex moisture-wicking sock lining, an active carbon layer to minimize humidity and odor, a heel cup stabilizer and extra medial forefoot support. Better for the walker whose gait requires more stability and control. 
<P><I>Women's sizes. Widths: AAA, AA, B, D, EE. Size range: 4-13.</I> 


<P><B>NaturalSport Catalyst</B> 
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe3.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="98">
<P>The newest high-tech walker from NaturalSport is the Catalyst, which incorporates the company's C3+ aerobic walker technology. C3+ features a dual-density molded EVA midsole and the Cradle. The Cradle is an EVA outsole cushioning pad augmenting a "self-centering device" rebound pad for proper shock absorption, energy return and stability enhancement. Reflective heel piping anticipates night walking for the serious walker.  
<P><I>Women's Sizes.  Widths: N, M, W. Size range:  4-12.  Men's Sizes. Widths: N, M, W. Size range: 6-15.</I>


<P><B>Soft Spots Supremes</B>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe4.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="129">
<P>If you don't even want to feel the roadway, Soft Spots Supremes, with its multilayered cushioning system, is my favorite. Originally marketed and developed for nurses, Supremes has turned into a superb casual comfort  shoe that doubles as a light walking shoe for any woman. Extraordinary shock absorption in tandem with superior support starts with a cushioning polyurethane outsole that hosts a steel shank for longitudinal stability. PVC foam pads have been inserted at the toe, metatarsals and heel. All that is topped by a medium density PVC midsole. The insole itself is a three-layer moisture-wicking device with memory cradled in an EVA heel cup. That insole is treated with antimicrobial agents. A padded tongue along with D-ring lacing keeps the pressure off. 
<P><I>Women's sizes. Widths: SS, N, M, W, WW. Size range: 5-13. Now also available for men. Widths: M, W, WW. Size range: 7-13.</I>


<P><B>Rockport's Rocsports Women's Interval Walker</B>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe5.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="94">
<P>The Interval Walker is a truly original design from Rockport. It's basically a sock with a walking shoe built around it. Pure genius. You have to put it on to believe it. The Interval Walker sock-shoe includes all the features of a durable walking shoe: removable high density EVA insole, double heel counter, and lightweight EVA midsole, and two-piece rubber outsole. But this shoe, aimed at the fitness walker, is light as a feather. I barely felt it on my feet. 
<P><I>Women's sizes. Widths: N, M, W. Sizes range: 5-12.  Men's sizes. Widths: M, W. Sizes range: 6-15.</I>


<P><B>New Balance WW551</B>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe6.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="99">
<P>The WW551 is a relatively inexpensive shoe new this spring, that reflects a great deal of shoe engineering experience. Designed for fast-paced walkers seeking cardiovascular benefits, the WW551 has deeper flex grooves for more frequent and powerful toe-off. Its larger last, or shoe mold, makes this shoe deeper and therefore ready for orthotics, and more accommodating to the high-instep and narrow-heeled female walker. This is the shoe if you're going after the fast aerobic walk. The WW551 is one in a series of New Balance walkers for women. 
<P><I>Women's sizes. Widths: AA, B, D. Sizes range: 5-13.</I>


<P><B>Reebok RoadWalker DMX</B> 
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe7.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="158">
<P>An impressive bit of technology went into the advanced cushioning system in the RoadWalker DMX. Connected chambers in the midsole allow air to pump back and forth as you move through your gait cycle. In theory, this allows an extra cushion of air to shift to the exact part of the foot making contact with the ground. The stylish but athletic design makes this a shoe you'll choose when both looks and extreme comfort are important. 
<P><I>Women's size range: 5-12.  Men's size range:  6.5-15.</I>

<B>Clarks of England Glider</B> 
<IMG SRC="/graphics/mshoe1.jpg" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="97">
<P>An exquisitely supportive fitness walking shoe that protects the foot even over rough surfaces with a solid platform of support and shock absorption. A rubber outsole meets the road. Two additional layers absorb shock: a compression molded EVA midsole topped by a removable compression molded EVA insole. For support, count on a rigid heel counter and padded collar. A favorite when distance walking is on the program.  
<P><I>Men's Sizes. Widths: N, M, W. Size range: 7-13. Women's Sizes. Widths: N, M, W. Size range: 5-12.</I>


<P><B>Clarks of England Air Mover</B>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/mshoe2.jpg" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="86">
<P>My number one favorite casual walking shoe. The lacing system, a combination of D-rings and regular eyelets anchored from the midfoot area, creates a comfortable unpressured enclosure within a roomy toebox. Soft subtle snuffed oil leather is kind to the touch. What is surely one of the finest casual walking shock absorption systems only begins with a special leather-topped perforated polyurethane insole. The insole's underside is corrugated to fit precisely into a corrugated dual-density midsole featuring a foam filler augmented by an active air chamber. When I go for a long stroll after dinner or on weekend afternoons, I lace up my Air Movers. 
<P><I>Men's Sizes. Widths: M. Size range 7-13.</I> 

<P><B>Ecco World Wide Walker</B>
<P>Somewhere between a comfort shoe and a casual walker is the Ecco Walker. I wear Eccos when I take short strolls or attend seminars. Constructed of soft, lightweight oiled nubuck leather with a thick, rough non-pressuring lace, this Danish-made walker keeps my feet cool and absorbs simple ground reaction forces. The secret is roomy European design plus a three-prong comfort and cooling system. A polyurethane outsole supports a second polyurethane midsole capped by about a half inch of latex foam. Latex is hydrophobic, which means it traps moisture. But then a porous hydrophilic insole wicks that moisture away within about 24 hours. These shoes are fun to walk in. The Walker is also nature friendly: the outsole is freon-free and the insole is made of recycled fibers. 
<P><I>Men's Sizes 40-47 (European). Women's Sizes 35-42 (European).</I>


<P><B>Etonic Trans Am</B>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/mshoe4.jpg" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="116">
<P>One of Etonic's best light walkers is the Trans Am. A single density EVA midsole sits atop rugged solid rubber. The removable insole is an EVA with heel and arch support. An external heel stabilizer, a PVC heel counter and roomy toebox round out the shoe. The women's version is 1.2 ounces lighter than the men's. 
<P><I>Men's Sizes.  Widths: B, D, EE, EEEE. Size range: 6.5-13.  Women's Sizes. Widths: AA, B, D, EE. Size range 5-11.</I>


<P><B>Wilson Tech Walker</B>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe5.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="108">
<P>My number one performance walking shoe choice is the Wilson Technical Walker. The engineering that went into this shoe is a tribute to the public demand for a performance walking shoe. Note the word performance. The Technical Walker is a white walking shoe not to be taken lightly. Lace it up for heavy duty reasonably smooth surface walking, such as five miles down the jogging path, or into town from that country bed and breakfast. You barely feel the ground wearing these Wilsons. I have never felt so buoyant in a performance walker.
<P>The features of this high-tech walker are many. Start at the bottom. A sturdy plastic medial post resists pronation, that is, the natural rolling in of the foot when it contacts the ground. The rugged and gripping rubber outsole is made of Goodyear's Indy 500 Plus Max. The gimmicky looking green polyurethane heel insert really works, offering extra cushioning and energy return during heel strike, the foot's first contact during gait. Deep outsole grooves accommodate the flexing of toe-off. 
<P>Inside, you'll find a unique molded EVA insole topped with a terry-like fabric. I hate the word unique, but this is the first insole to come with a support attachment--two little latex "cookies" that fit into a dome designed to prop up the insole should it bottom out after a while, or should the walker have a higher arch. The cookies come on an attached card. 
<P>A pigskin heel strip helps avoid slippage. A padded tongue cushions the foot from lacing. The shoe could benefit from additional moisture control, so they may run warm. We hope to see that corrected in the next version, but for now, this is the best performance walker we've seen. 
<P><I>Men's Sizes. Widths: D, EE. Size range: 6.5-16. Women's Sizes. Widths AA, B, D. Size range 5-11.</I>

<B>Should You Walk in Running Shoes?</B>
</CENTER>
<P>Until recently many people undertook heavy duty walking in running shoes. Some biomechanics experts feel there is no difference. Others feel that properly engineered walking shoes are better for the gait characteristics of walking, especially since running shoes are designed for far greater flexing. Paul Taylor, DPM, a former president of the American College of Podiatric Sports Medicine and a former consultant to Rockport, believes that those who walk but do not run benefit from a walking shoe over a running shoe. Dr. Taylor also believes that those who have given up running to concentrate on walking will do just as well if they continue wearing their favorite running models.

<H1>Walk It Off!</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+3>Walking to lose weight is as easy as putting one foot in front of the other. Here's how to get started.</FONT>
<P><I>by Suzanne Levine, DPM</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Throughout the late 1970s and the 1980s the news was dominated by exercise images, from the lone runner in the rain to throngs of people panting through marathons and triathlons. The latest exercise machines and rows of bouncing aerobic dancers constantly flashed before our eyes. "No pain, no gain" became the national slogan. A good many people, about a third of the American population, joined the fitness movement and began to exercise vigorously and regularly. But many others gave it a brief try and then said, "That's not for me." This column is for the rest of us--the 66 percent of all Americans who have resisted the fitness craze. 
<P>Although I now actually relish my daily walk, until a few years ago I thought I'd never escape my upbringing. I was a born-and-raised couch potato. Both my parents are heavy-set, sedentary people. As a child, I was encouraged to read, paint and study hard, but never to dance, play ball or ride a bike. I was not only a chubby little girl, I had a foot problem and wore clunky orthopedic shoes that made it impossible to skip, jump or run.
<P>As a teenager, I escaped my upbringing for a while. I threw away the clunky shoes, took up a sport, lost weight and began to attract some welcome male attention. My foot problem inspired me to study podiatry, and by the time I was in my late 20's I had a thriving professional practice, a husband, two children and absolutely no time to myself.
<P>I regressed to my old habits. I no longer did anything more strenuous than walking to the refrigerator, and I steadily and undramatically gained weight. At 29, I weighed a whopping 180 lbs., a heavy load for a 5-foot-4 frame. It was weight I could no longer hide, even with the most clever clothing. Three months after the birth of my second child, people thought I was still pregnant. That's when I knew I had to do something.
<P>Searching for that something was a long journey. My experience reads like a social history of exercise and diet in the 1970s and 80s. I bought every tape Jane Fonda ever made, but her program was such a grinding chore that I couldn't make myself do the exercises. My bedroom decor includes a $3,000 computerized indoor bicycle and an $800 cross-country skiing machine, both very handy to drape clothes on.
<P>I signed up for aerobic dance at a swanky health club, hoping that the large financial investment would increase my motivation. How I cringed from all those mirrors reflecting my heavy body squeezed into a leotard. And I felt like a klutz. I didn't learn the routines easily, and the indifference of the instructors and the thinness and grace of the other students soon made me dread going. A try at ballet class ended the same way. Jogging, roller skating and bike riding also bit the dust. The jogging was torture on my knees, feet and back. After six miserable weeks, I gave up.
<P>After a year of dauntless experimenting with various kinds of exercises, the gods finally took pity on me. It was a lovely day in June and I was in a big hurry to get home from my office. I tried to hail a cab for several frustrating minutes and finally decided that I'd walk--high heels, briefcase, shopping bag and all. Since I had someone waiting at home, I walked at quite a fast pace--less than a minute a block.
<P>As I walked, I noticed that my mind was cleansed of all the minor annoyances of the day. I watched the passing faces on the street with interest, and familiar places took on a new freshness. When I reached my home, I realized, to my surprise, that I felt terrific. My breathing was a bit faster and deeper than normal, but I wasn't uncomfortable. My skin looked bright from the rushing air. Although I'd just worked for nine hours, I felt more refreshed and energetic than when I'd woken up in the morning.
<P>This incident occurred in 1984, when walking was not generally considered a form of exercise. But as a doctor, I knew that the goal of exercise was increased heart rate and muscle use, and that there was no reason these could not be achieved by brisk walking. Then and there I decided to drop all guilt feelings about the expensive clotheshorses in the bedroom and lapsed health-club memberships. I was going to walk every day--and I was going to do it because I liked it, because doing so felt comfortable, because it was "me."
<P>This promise to myself turned out to be surprisingly easy to keep. For the past 12 years, I have, in fact, walked almost every day. Most of the time I walk around the track in New York's Central Park, ignoring the disdain of joggers who try to push me out of the way. But sometimes, if I can't make the park, I take my hour on the city's streets or the roads near our country home.
<P>After six months of walking, I gained so much confidence and control over my life that I was at last ready to tackle my weight problem. By itself, walking took off some of the pounds--but the process was very slow. I had tried even more diets than exercise programs, but this time I had the confidence to create my own diet, based on the foods I like to eat, my schedule and my basic knowledge of good nutrition. In a year and a half, I lost 60 lbs.
<P>Can walking work for you as it did for me? I believe walking is the exercise answer for many types of people:
<UL><LI>the nonathletic
<LI>the over-35 crowd
<LI>those with medical problems
<LI>those who don't like to exercise
<LI>those with very busy, unpredictable schedules</UL>
<P>My program begins with the pleasure principle--the simple premise that it's easier to get yourself to do something you like than something you don't like. Walking is the most "likable" exercise for nonathletic people. It's pleasantly private. Passersby won't even know you're exercising, and you might forget it yourself. And walking can be combined with other enjoyable activities--window shopping, cloud gazing, socializing.
<P>But is walking "real" exercise? Indeed it is, and more and more doctors are finding that it is also the safest, most agreeable and most accessible exercise they can recommend to their patients. (Take the <A HREF="#test">Your Exercise and Health Beliefs Test</A> to see what walking can do for you.)
<P>So let's get started! First, some logistic considerations: For now all you need to decide is where and when your very first few walks will occur, and what you'll wear. To answer these questions, you need to get out of your chair and explore your neighborhood and your closet.
<P>Where will you walk? It might sound like a cop-out, but if you have a car, it's not a bad idea to go for a drive and set the mileage counter to get an idea of the distances of places you'd be likely to walk. How far is it to the bank? The train station? The nearest park with a track? The nearest indoor shopping mall? Make a few notes about any walks that look interesting and convenient. Search out a landmark that's about 20 blocks from your workplace that you could walk to and back during lunchtime. Or consider how you might create a walk to and from work by, say, getting off the train or bus a bit before you usual stop.
<P>The goal of this exercise is to map out at least two different walks of about two miles each that you'd like to take in the next week or so.
<P>What will you wear? Now, dig into your drawers and your closet. Try to find what I like to call "comfort clothes." This might be an old stretched-out pair of shorts and a large T-shirt. Don't forget comfortably fitting underwear.
<P>A decent pair of sneakers or even very comfortable sturdy, flat shoes are sufficient for your walking-readiness exercise. Later you'll need to purchase a pair of suitable walking shoes. (See Stride's Guide to Walking Shoes). Choose your socks carefully, and be sure they're not too thick or too thin for the shoe you've chosen. The goal is to find clothes that make you feel free and let you move.
<P>When will you walk? It's too soon to come up with a "lifetime" answer to this question(e.g., I will always walk 30 minutes before breakfast). Instead, experiment with several times a day to find those that fit most easily into your schedule. If you're a very busy person, the challenge is to find a time to "sneak in" a walk. Dog owners often think of themselves as walkers because they take the dog out a few times a day. But let's face it, the dog is the leader on most of these walks and the owner stops obediently whenever the animal wants to sniff, scratch or talk to another dog. This kind of stop-and-go walking does not substitute for 20 to 60 minutes of brisk, steady fitness walking. The same is true of walking with a toddler in a stroller or a small child--it's stop-and-go and at a pace a lot slower than your maximum. So it's important to schedule your walk at a time you can leave the dog and the children at home. Go over your plans for the next days in your mind and try to find a 20 to 30 minute opening.
<P>Okay. It's time to declare yourself "ready." The rest is a matter of doing it: Get into a comfortable walking outfit and seize the reward you deserve: a brisk, lively, determined, happy half-hour outdoors.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="test">Your Exercise and Health Beliefs</A></H2>
1. T or F <B>A daily brisk walk can improve a person's mood and reduce stress.</B> TRUE. In fact, scientists have found that a daily walk elevates the mood of even severely depressed psychiatric patients. It works for the elderly, school children and stressed-out working people.

<P>2. T or F <B>To stay fit you must constantly increase your exercise level.</B> FALSE. You cannot always become faster, stronger or more flexible. Our bodies have built-in limits that are best respected. In fact, once your body is well conditioned (this takes most people about six months of walking) you may even be able to cut back on the time you spend exercising and still achieve maximum health benefits.

<P>3. T or F  <B>Walking is not real aerobic exercise.</B> FALSE. Walking is, indeed, excellent aerobic exercise that stimulates the heart, lungs and muscles and increases the circulation of the blood so that it benefits every organ of the body. Your heart may not pound the way it does when you're running or dancing at a fast pace. But pink cheeks, tingly skin and a feeling of renewed energy are the gentler signs that your walking is conditioning your heart.

<P>4. T or F <B>Exercise alone can cause weight loss.</B> TRUE. Theoretically, if you increase the amount of energy you expend and eat your usual amount of food, you should lose weight. For people who are hoping to lose, say, 5 lbs. over a year, or to maintain their weight, walking alone is enough. But I don't want to kid you. If you're overweight and want to lose fairly quickly, it will also be necessary to cut back on fattening, unhealthy foods. 
<P>Happily, this becomes a lot easier to do once you've established a walking habit.

<P>5. T or F <B>Weightbearing exercise helps to keep bones strong and prevent osteoporosis.</B> TRUE. During weightbearing exercise, such as walking, the force of gravity becomes an ally. It pulls on the tissue of your bones and stimulates them to take in more calcium and maintain their density and strength. The absence of this stimulation is what causes astronauts to lose bone density in the gravity-free atmosphere of space. Regular walking and a calcium-rich diet are the best-known ways to prevent osteoporosis and the broken hips and arms and spinal distortions that limit the lives of many elderly people.

<P>6. T or F <B>The most noticeable benefits of exercise come after two or three months of regular participation.</B> TRUE. You need to stick to an exercise program for that long before you even have a chance to experience what a boost in fitness feels like. After two or three months you'll feel a new sense of power every time you climb a flight of stairs, lift a bag of groceries or run for a bus.

<P>7. T or F <B>When you feel pain during exercise, the best thing to do is keep going and work through it.</B> FALSE. Please don't fall for this dangerous exercise myth! The fact is that a staggering three to five million sports-related injuries--some of them quite serious and even crippling--turn up every year at doctors' offices, clinics and emergency rooms. And this statistic tells only part of the story, since it doesn't include all of the minor and major aches, pains and pulled muscles that go unreported.
<P>If you feel any pain greater than a slight tug on your leg muscles while you're walking, stop and rest. If you don't feel better in a few minutes, it's time to immediately seek medical attention. Pain in the chest, neck, arms, or jaw during exertion is a sign of heart problems. Even if symptoms quickly disappear, promptly report them to a doctor.

<P>8. T or F <B>People who have dropped exercise programs before are likely to do it again.</B> FALSE. In fact, studies have shown that it often takes several tries to change an ingrained habit, such as smoking cigarettes or avoiding exercise. If you've failed in the past, you've accumulated some knowledge about what does and doesn't work for you. You can use that knowledge to succeed this time around.

<P>9. T or F <B>Walking may be okay as a beginning, but it's not enough to achieve true fitness.</B> FALSE. This is not true for the person with ordinary fitness goals: better health, more energy, improved mood and aerobic conditioning. If, however, you're interested in running marathons or competing in Best Body on the Beach contests, you may want to add other exercises once you've gotten into the walking habit.

<P>10. T or F <B>Moderate exercise can improve a person's chances of having a longer and healthier life.</B> TRUE. This is the most exciting news to come from scientific studies over the past few years. Moderate, painless exercise can give great health benefits. One landmark study that has been following the health of 17,000 Harvard alumni for up to 40 years offers proof of the benefits of moderate exercise. The study found that alumni who burned as little as 500 calories a week in exercise had death rates 15 to 20 percent lower than those who were almost completely sedentary. An hour to 90 minutes of walking a week is about all it takes for a 150-lb. man to burn those 500 calories.

<H1>Building a Better Boot</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+3>Two women equestrians grew tired of uncomfortable riding boots and decided to do something about it.</FONT>
<P><I>by Judy Crawford</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Pam Parker and Beth Cross certainly weren't the first horsewomen to recognize that for all the attention lavished on horses' feet, hardly any was devoted to their own. Women's riding boots, they noted with some disdain, were most often scaled-down versions of men's boots, with no allowance for the structural differences between the male and female foot. As a result, their boots gave them neither the proper traction and ankle support in the stirrup, nor an acceptably comfortable fit on the ground.
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n2/women2.jpg" WIDTH="275" HEIGHT="286" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Pam Parker and Beth Cross">
<P>But these two women weren't content to suffer in silence. They had the background, the contacts and the commitment to do something about it. Five years ago, they resolved that if no one else would make a satisfactory women's riding boot, they'd have to do it themselves. "Being avid equestrians, Pam and I found that we were like most people," Cross explains. "We would wear our sneakers to the barn, change into our riding boots, ride, then change back into our sneakers as quickly as possible because our boots were so uncomfortable."
<P>Parker and Cross, as it happens, were not ordinary equestrians. As consultants with a large international consulting firm in San Francisco, they had worked closely with such clients as Reebok and Avia, two giants in athletic footwear. Having earned their MBAs from Stanford Business School, where they met, they both were well-versed in business principles and practices. And through their association with Reebok, they had worked closely with some of the top designers and marketing minds in the industry.
<P>The result: Ariat International, Inc., an upstart company intent on doing for equestrian footwear what Adidas, Nike and Reebok did for running shoes more than a decade ago.
<P>Started from Parker's home with both women's life savings and a half dozen co-workers, the company now employs more than 30 people working out of a 20,000 square-foot space in San Carlos, California, a suburb 25 miles south of San Francisco. From four basic models of women's boot only three short years ago, Ariat offerings have grown to more than 80 different styles, including a few for men. Annual sales have doubled each year. Once found only in tack shops or boutiques catering to the horsey set, Ariat boots are now available in some 1,500 retail outlets, including many Nordstrom department stores. And while the bulk of Ariat customers are equestrians, some 30 percent of their customers never go near a horse, buying Ariat boots strictly for their distinctive look or comfortable fit.
<P>It seems obvious now, but Parker and Cross say they never would have realized the void in the equestrian footwear market had they not been riders themselves. Cross was raised on a working farm in Pennsylvania, and Parker owns a horse and rides whenever possible. In fact, it was in the course of buying a horse more than six years ago that Parker was struck with the inspirational lightning bolt that became Ariat.
<P>"I was out buying the horse I now own," Parker recalls, "I was trying out a bunch of fancy horses I couldn't afford, and several trainers were standing around. My trainer had just bought a bunch of paddock boots, and he said, "The day they become comfortable is the day they wear out." And I thought, "He's right--there must be a better way to make boots." 
<P>Through their work with Reebok, Parker and Cross had gleaned valuable information about conceptualizing, designing and engineering a shoe to maximize an athlete's performance. But the greatest asset that came from their relationship with Reebok was Angel Martinez, known as the "Father of Aerobics."
<P>One of Reebok's founders, Martinez convinced Cross and Parker that they could bring the same technology to riding boots that he had brought to athletic shoes. Fifteen years earlier, Martinez had seen the potential in the women's footwear market: Rather than forcing women into smaller versions of men's running shoes, he and his team at Reebok designed the first aerobic shoe to meet the special needs of a woman's foot. In many ways, the needs of the 90s female equestrian parallel those of the 80s female aerobics enthusiast, Cross notes. "Women's feet tend to be broader across the ball and more narrow in the heel," she says, "so when they wear men's boots, the ball of the foot is very uncomfortable and the heel slips in the boot."
<P>Before they could even approach the drawing board, Cross and Parker realized that they first needed to talk to riders--lots of them--in order to design a boot to fill that market niche. They found that riders above all wanted a boot that was easy to put on and take off and one that offered ankle support while riding, yet was comfortable. Among the most common complaints about the boots currently available were scarring across the instep and slipping of the heel, sweaty feet, numbness of the toes and durability problems such as detached soles and worn-out leather.
<P>The next step: assembling a design team for the daunting task of creating "the world's best riding boot." The women talked with biotechnical engineers, podiatrists, and other experts they had known through their consulting work. "It was the ultimate networking challenge," recalls Parker. But the networking paid off. Randy Merrell, one of the foremost designers of hiking boots, agreed to help with the project. The company's senior advisor, Merrell turned out to be a horseman himself. Michael Toschi, an athletic footwear designer specializing in cycling shoes, also expressed interest. Toschi grew up on a farm and was familiar with horses; he saw that cycling and riding place similar biomechanical demands on the foot in the pedal and stirrup, respectively. He is now the leader of Ariat's design team. Frank Lin, a chemical engineer with 10 years' experience with Nike, worked with Toschi to develop a special compound for the sole of the boot. The design called for a hand-molded carbon sole that would provide the durability, flexibility, lateral control and traction riders had asked for, and a specially engineered footbed that would make the boot wearable on the ground as well as in the saddle. 
<P>The team studied worn boots to determine how boots wear and break down. They also immersed themselves in the equestrian lifestyles. The team came to realize that riders actually spend more time on the ground than on the horse.
<P>Months of trial and error finally produced Ariat's first prototype. Ariat then enlisted local riders to test the initial boot prototypes. During that early stage, California-based world champion endurance rider Becky Hart inspired at least one design element: the boot's shock-absorbing "float beds," gel-like pads that cushion small bones and nerves in both the toe and the heel to protect against nerve damage and stirrup fatigue.
<P>By 1992, the boots were ready for the public. Priced from $100 to $400 a pair and ranging from paddock boots to competition dress boots, Ariat boots are more expensive than a standard paddock boot, but less expensive than the ornate dress boots on the market. Models in the Lifestyle Collection (boots for non-riders) are priced from $80 to $220.
<P>The company name "Ariat" derives from the Italian word "aria" which means "perfect solo performance." "Performance is what our footwear is all about," says Beth Cross.

<H2>What's Inside</H2>

</CENTER>
<P>It's what you don't see that counts when it comes to stability, support and comfort. Inside is Ariat's ATS technology. Instead of a conventional steel shank, Ariat uses a Y-shaped shank of a lightweight, carbon-fiber composite which is flexible, yet strong, for a broad base of support. This mid-foot shank works together with a stabilizing rear-foot heel cradle to reduce lateral twisting, or torque, which in turn reduces fatigue and stress to ligaments and muscles in the feet and lower legs. An outsole made of a carbon compound similar to that used in Indy 500 car tires offers durability, temperature control and flexibilty. Finally, a gel orthotic-like "footbed" with arch support and rear-foot heel cradle offers important shock absorption.<B>--Elizabeth Black</B>

<H1>Hiking the Big Island</H1>
<P><I>by <A HREF="mailto:bkliewer@ifi-mpls.com">Bradley</A> and <A HREF="mailto:skliewer@ifi-mpls.com">Suzanne Kliewer</A></I>
</CENTER>
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n2/hawaii2.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="404" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="map of the big island">
<P>From the snow-capped Mauna Kea to the unstoppable stream of lava percolating from the Pu'U' O'o vent, Hawai'i has aptly earned the moniker "The Land of Fire and Ice." The youngest of the eight major islands in the Hawaiian chain is a collage of contrasts. Barren landscapes intersperse with dense vegetation. Sandy beaches interrupt rock-covered terrain and sloping mountainsides suddenly dive into dramatic cliffs at the ocean's edge. Giant waves of watery violence continuously crash into cliffs and seawalls that protect strangely calm and serene adjacent bay waters. 
<P>Yes, most people avoid using the island's official name, Hawai'i (without the diacritical mark and extra "ee" at the end) in favor of its endearing nickname, "the Big Island," to avoid confusion with the state's similarly written name, Hawaii. Less popular, less developed and less crowded than the island of Oahu (home of Honolulu and Waikiki), the Big Island's geological and climatic extremes provide an inviting playground for those who wish to hike, walk, jog or even stroll through one of nature's most concentrated efforts. 

<H2>Hilo</H2> 
Hilo is the perfect starting point for Big Island exploration. With the city's sparse selection of evening activities, you can relax and recover from jet lag without feeling you've missed much if you retire early. And since Hilo is on the rainier (and by extension, drearier) side of the island, you can feel comfortable knowing you'll end your trip on a high note with the warm, sunny skies of the other side.
<P>We made our base the Hilo Hawaiian Hotel. Like many of the better hotels on the island, it has a refreshing open-air lobby and a scenic view of the bay. Its location along Banyan Drive, a wide street with light traffic, provides a convenient and scenic morning walk or run. For a better ocean view, cross the bridge onto Coconut Island and take a brisk hike around the park. 
<P>As you plan your excursions to Hilo's neighboring regions over the next few days, prepare for plenty of driving and walking. The perimeter of the island itself is several hundred miles, and even the sites on the Hilo side of the island are too far from town to comfortably walk or bike to. 
<P>Two types of footwear will serve you well: a rugged pair of hiking shoes and wet/dry sandals with thick nonskid soles that feel as comfortable in the water as they do on the alternating rocky and sandy shorelines. Before leaving for Hawaii, we purchased Teva sandals and Rockport XCS boots, both of which were quite comfortable and well-suited to the unpredictable terrain. (We suggest wearing one pair of shoes and keeping the other in the car as you travel.)    

<H2>Dramatic waters</H2>
From Hilo, our first day's explorations took us north along the windward (and therefore "wet") side of the island--the Hamakua coast, where prevailing ocean breezes hurl in, hit the mountains and dump their moisture as rain. These winds then proceed to the other side, drier and warmer. The scenery alternates between lush river gulches, fields of sugar cane, barren land and abandoned mills. Before you leave the city, you might want to pack a lunch--the population and traffic are somewhat sparse. A great picnic spot is Laupahoehoe Point County Park, about 25 miles from Hilo along Highway 19, which hugs the coastline. Watch carefully for the sign to Laupahoehoe. It's easy to miss the unassuming sign that marks the turnoff. <P>The road winds down to a lush green meadow near sea-level. A memorial in the park testifies to the violent power the sea can unleash: on April 1, 1946, a tidal wave swept a schoolhouse at this point with 20 children and four teachers out to sea. Throughout the island you will find stories of people and towns lost to similar disasters--a grim reminder that this island paradise has a powerful underside.
<P>Another beautiful but more crowded picnic spot is at Akaka Falls State Park back toward Hilo. A paved trail winds through the hills overlooking two large falls that drop several hundred feet: Kahuna and the park's namesake Akaka. The trail is only about a half mile long--just right for stretching your legs.
<P>Before heading out of town on our second day, we visited Rainbow Falls in the hills of Hilo, only about three miles from our hotel. If you catch them on a sunny morning, as we did, you may very well see a rainbow generated in the mist of the falling waters. 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n2/falls2.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="187" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Rainbow Falls">
<P>From Rainbow Falls, we headed southeast on Highway 130 for a tour of the Puna region. As one of the areas covered by lava as recently as the 1950s and 1960s, we weren't expecting much in terms of landscape. But to our pleasant surprise, fields of the bubbly a'a lava would abruptly yield to thick forests, orchards and orchid nurseries interspersed with several quaint towns.  
<P>Be sure to visit Lava Tree State Monument. As the lava flows engulfed ohia trees, the cooling effect of the water in the trunks left columns and lumps of hardened lava as the still liquefied flows drained away. The remaining tree molds now surrounded by forest provide an intriguing walk in the midst of an enchanting landscape of oddly shaped rock lumps and logs, deep cracks and fields of grass. Heed the warnings and stay on the trails. You wouldn't want to risk falling into one of the earth cracks scattered throughout this park and other volcanic sites on the island.
<P>Down Highway 130 past the park, about two miles after the pavement ends, you'll come to a metal tower on Cape Kumukahi. The tower is actually a modern lighthouse, minus the living quarters and keeper. Flows of a'a lava came within a few feet of the lighthouse before magically splitting to both sides, sparing the tower. The Kumukahi Lighthouse once stood at the ocean's edge, but the a'a lava that spilled into the sea built up an entirely new coastline extending hundreds of yards from the original one. If you decide to walk over the a'a flows to the coast, wear your hiking boots and watch your step. The jagged edges of a'a lava are much sharper than ordinary rocks, and will almost certainly cut your hands if you fall.

<H2>Hiking the volcano 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n2/lava2.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="184" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Volcanoes National Park"></H2>
On our third day on the island, we packed our bags and headed to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and one of the island's hallmarks, the active volcano Kilauea. Volcanoes National Park has some of the longest and most diverse trails you will find on the island. It also receives the most varied weather, so come prepared for everything from chilling rain to blistering sun. During our stay at the Volcano House, a guesthouse overlooking the crater's rim, the temperature swung from nighttime lows in the lower 40s to highs in the upper 60s. The 11-mile drive around the crater rim covered everything from cloudy, damp rain forest to sunny, parched desert. A drive down Chain of Craters Road brings even drier and hotter weather as you drop down the steep mountainsides to sea level. If you're lucky, you may even see active lava flows and billowing steam where hot lava enters the ocean. Lava has been flowing continuously since 1983, although it is sometimes hidden from view as it flows through covered lava tubes from mountainside to sea. 
<P>The eeriest walk by far was across the bottom of Kilauea Caldera, the crater of the active volcano. We rapidly descended the sides of the crater through beautiful forest that ended suddenly in bleak landscape. The only trace of a path were the piles of stones leading from one point on the trail to the next. As a misty rain fell from an overcast sky, we trod carefully across a desolate, uneven terrain of smooth lava flows. Around us, cracks and holes spewed steam into the already damp air. Kneeling down, we found the hardened lava surface warm to the touch. 
<P>From trails winding along the bottom of the crater to excursions around the rim, you will find miles of walking in hilly and flat terrain. Go ahead and wander by steam vents, sulphur banks and through the old Thurston Lava Tube set in a beautiful rainforest depression.  
<P>The Kona Coast. When you're ready for some consistently warm days and sunny weather, continue on to the Kona Coast--home of world-famous Kona coffee. You'll rediscover civilization and its side-effects (such as traffic jams) as you drive around the twisting roads leading into the region. We spent our time at the luxurious Mauna Kea Resort, which brought a sense of seclusion despite the higher population densities. 
<P>On our first evening, as we dined at the open-sided Pavilion Restaurant, manta rays made an appearance on the shore. The area where these gracious creatures feed on plankton has been lit for guests' viewing pleasure. At dawn, as we looked out over the bay, humpback whales were playing in the waters. The sight inspired us to call the Oceans Sports Desk and reserve a spot on the Mauna Kea's whale-watching boat. Although the whales were less active that afternoon, we saw a baby, mother and her escort from a range of about 100 yards.
<P>When you're not whale watching, you can swim on the beach, snorkel in the bay, work out in the fitness center, walk the trails, play tennis or golf or charter other tours. The fitness center, although small, will adequately serve your vacation workout needs. Several treadmills, exercycles, stair climbing machines and Nautilus machines are available. For a larger selection, check out the Hapuna Beach Prince, the Mauna Kea's newer sister resort just a brief shuttle ride away. Between the two hotels lies a Vita course, which consists of a jogging path between various exercise stations, nestled in the hilly terrain. While the stations were not very busy, many runners used the path for some serious hill training. For another hill workout, run up the winding road from the hotel to the resort entrance at the highway.
<P>Another exhilarating activity, which may be arranged through the Ocean Sports Desk, is a SCUBA dive. (SCUBA, by the way, stands for Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus.) If you're not a certified diver, you should consider taking courses before travelling to Hawaii. (You can learn on the island, but the time involved will distract from your other activities.) On the way to the dive site, we saw another baby and mother humpback that approached within 50 yards of the boat while dolphins jumped and played near the bow. We had to sit and drift awhile because federal regulations prohibit approaching marine mammals or running engines while they are in the vicinity.
<P>Diving in the coral reefs plunges one into a world of beauty that puts saltwater aquariums to shame. Hundreds of brightly colored marine fish greet you at every turn of the head. At times whales could be heard singing in the distance. Neither the colors nor the sensation can be captured properly in print or film--the experience was unforgettable. For a little extra thrill, we were given the option of swimming through submerged lava tubes (those who are not comfortable in tight quarters could swim over or around them). If you're not into SCUBA, try simply snorkeling. Either way, you'll get a good lower-body workout as you kick your way through the water (unlike swimming, you don't use your arms). If you opt for SCUBA, the extra 50+ pounds of equipment will keep you working, too.
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n2/waipio.jpg" WIDTH="375" HEIGHT="275" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Waipio Valley">
<P>While in Kona plan the better part of a day to complete your circuit of the island with a trip to the Waipio Valley. You cannot descend the steep road into the valley without a four-wheel drive vehicle, but viewing it from the overlook at the head of the road is itself a breathtaking experience. The lush vegetation, river and crashing surf stand in stark contrast to the dry Kohala Coast just 30 miles away.
<P>Despite a wonderful natural setting, by far the best Hawaii has to offer is its residents. They are genuinely friendly and knowledgeable about their island home. In fact, they seem amazingly unphased by the many tourists who invade their island paradise, who in turn now think of Hawaii as their home away from home. A common refrain among guests at the Mauna Kea was their year-in and year-out loyalty to the resort's homey atmosphere. To quote a couple of golfers waiting to try their luck at the infamous hole number 3, "We found a place we really loved and decided to keep coming back." And that's the magic of Hawaii--time seems never ending, the sun is warm, and the island calls you back again and again as it does the ocean waves that can't stop returning to its eternal coast.
<P>
<H3>Places to Stay</H3>
<B>Hilo Hawaiian</B>  (808) 935-9361
<P>The rooms in the Hilo Hawaiian have been recently refurbished, offering comfortable quarters. The ocean side rooms offer a beautiful view of Hilo's calm bay waters. Situated along scenic Banyan Drive, the hotel is protected from heavy traffic yet conveniently close to the highway and downtown Hilo.
<P>
<B>Volcano House</B>  (808) 967-7321
<P>Situated inside Volcanoes National Park on the rim of the Kilauea Caldera, the crater view rooms provide one of the most dramatic views you'll find in Hawaii. Chairs are arranged alongside expansive windows that make the most of nature's display. 
<P>
<B>Mauna Kea Hotel</B>  (800) 882-6060
<P>Although it is home to one of the top golf courses in America, the Mauna Kea is not just for golf fanatics. As one of the most luxurious resorts in the islands, the hotel provides accommodations for about any activity you care to indulge in, from lounging on the white sand beach to SCUBA diving to helicopter rides over lava-spewing vents. A great place to get away from it all.<B>--B.K.</B>

<H1>Unmanaged Care</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+2><I>We call for a new alliance of healthcare professionals and patients demanding accountability and responsibility in managed care.</I></FONT>
<P><I>by Edwin and Elizabeth Black</I>
</CENTER>

<P>This country is about to enter a health care crisis that many consumers haven't seen coming. For years, our nation was rightly concerned about out-of-control health care costs. They brought in the controllers: managed care, the alphabetizers of medicine. HMOs, PPOs, IPAs, MCOs. It began as a noble enterprise to rescue and reform American healthcare. But now the controllers are out of control--and are hurting people everywhere. 
<P>A very important transition has occurred in managed care. What began as medicine controlling business has become business controlling medicine. There's a buck to be made--a big buck. That's why the big salaries and some of the most luscious advertising campaigns on TV are in managed care.
<P>Much of the problem lies in forms of <I>capitation</I> or paying by the head. Managed care organizations, in their frenzy to reduce costs, receive from either Medicare or employers a fixed fee for each covered patient. Now get this: the less money managed care spends on your health care, the more money it keeps from the fixed fee. 
<P>There's a term the health care industry uses: <I>overutilization</I>. That's a polysyllabic nicety for unnecessary or excessive treatments. The Congress, the Inspector General of Health and Human Services, health reformers and health policy journalists fought against overutilization for years. And people still remember that fight. But the new fight is against <I>underutilization</I>. That's where the Inspector General feels the major new indictments will be coming, where the big rip-offs are percolating. In a word, if you are entitled to quality health care, you should get what you were promised. 
<P>The doctors can't control managed care policies any more than family farmers can control agribusiness corporations. The managed care organizations, MCOs, now have gatekeepers who specialize in deferring or refusing needed treatment. Or they allocate a per-patient fee that makes it impossible for doctors to properly treat the patients. Or they prohibit needed treatments and in some instances even forbid the doctor to mention them--so-called gag rules--which many states are now making illegal.
<P>Doctors have seen large segments of their patient base disappear into the control of these MCOs during the past few years. Consequently, if doctors don't comply, they run the risk of losing a substantial part of their practices. As these MCOs follow merger and takeover patterns, giant all-powerful healthcare entities are created which can literally exercise the power of life and death over millions of Americans. 
<P>The care providers--the doctors--are increasingly squeezed out of the process. Now it's the pencil pushers who decide. They will never hold a stethoscope to your chest, never feel your ankle, never watch you limp, never touch your body. But they will decide.
<P>How does this affect lower body biomechanics and <CITE>Stride</CITE>? We are committed to Americans enjoying better lower body fitness, enjoyment and health. Yet it does no good for <CITE>Stride</CITE> to separate the truth from the myths about healthy shoes, knee pain and arthritis if your MCO will deny you the benefit. If you need a knee brace, will you get a generic one for general knee problems or the more expensive version specifically designed for athletic patellafemoral pain? If you need to see a doctor for an ankle sprain, will you be sent home with an Ace bandage and a pamphlet? If you are diabetic, will you be permitted to get a therapeutic shoe that can help you avoid amputation? If you need a custom foot orthotic, will you have to settle for a cheap overlay insole? Of course, not everyone needs the more expensive solutions and specialized care. But by the same token, not everyone will be helped by the inexpensive solution. 
<P>Does medicine need to be reformed? You bet. We've exposed our share of rip-offs. But right now the bigger problem is not with organized medicine, it's with the big business tycoons who are calling the shots for patients and doctors alike. 
<P>What can you do? First, understand how the system has changed and how it will affect you. Learn your medical rights. Learn to work with your doctor to stand up to the MCOs. Let your legislators know where you stand. Don't let the term <I>health care reform</I> serve as a front for unprecedented corporate profits at the expense of organized medicine and individual health. We call for a new alliance of health care professionals and patients demanding accountability and responsibility in managed care.
<P>In the weeks and months to come, you can learn more about protecting your rights, and achieving more of what you want right here. This editorial was written not for the medical establishment, or for any advertisers, or even for people like you and us. This was written for our daughter, age 11, and sons and daughters everywhere. In a few years, will they inherit accessible quality health care that is quick, cost-effective and efficient, or will the system be crippled when they need it most? You decide.

<H2>Healing the female heart</H2>
Heart disease is the number one killer of women, accounting for approximately 247,000 of the 520,000 heart attack deaths in the United States each year. Moreover, women are six times more likely to die from heart disease than from breast cancer. Yet the symptoms of women's heart disease are often ignored, misunderstood and misdiagnosed by doctors. Indeed, women themselves may grossly underestimate their own risk for heart problems. A new book focuses on what a woman can do to prevent heart disease and on how to resume one's life in the aftermath of a heart attack. <CITE>Healing the Female Heart: A Holistic Approach to Prevention and Recovery from Heart Disease</CITE>, coauthored by Washington D. C. cardiologist Elizabeth Ross, MD, and Judith Sachs, is published by Pocket Books, a division of Simon &#38; Schuster.
<P>"I have cared for hundreds of women in various stages of heart disease and have therefore a unique view of this illness--from the inside out," said Dr. Ross. "I felt that I had a mission to write this book... because I needed to tell more women about the dangers of ignoring their hearts, and the positive results of adopting a preventive lifestyle."
<P>The book outlines ways for women to begin taking care of their hearts at an earlier age, including guidelines for exercise and nutrition, tips for stress reduction, the pros and cons of hormone replacement therapy, and establishing a strong relationship with a physician.

<H2>Grelsamer on <CITE>Today</CITE></H2>
Ronald Grelsamer MD, premiere issue guest columnist for <CITE>Stride's</CITE> The Doctor's In column, appeared on NBC's Today Show a few weeks ago to talk about osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis, or degenerative joint disease, is a kind of arthritis caused by the wearing down of cartilage in the joints and affects from 16 to 30 million Americans. In fact, many experts believe the disease affects almost everyone over the age of 60 to some degree. In answer to Katie Couric's questioning, Dr. Grelsamer exploded the myth that arthritis in the joints precludes exercise. "On the contrary," said Grelsamer, "exercise keeps these joints from becoming stiffer, and of course the cardiovascular benefits and the feeling of well-being exercise brings should not be overlooked." However, the person with osteoarthritis may need to switch to forms of exercise that are kinder to joints, such as swimming or walking rather than jogging, he explained. Dr. Grelsamer's book, <CITE>The Columbia Presbyterian Osteoarthritis Handbook</CITE>, has just hit book stores, and contains a wealth of information for anyone with cranky joints.

<H2>Hush my Puppies!</H2>
An American icon from the 1950s is back, and has been showing up on Paris runways, in fashion magazine spreads and on a lot of celebrity feet. Hush Puppies, the classic suede shoes with thick crepe soles, were relaunched last year in an array of colors from basic black to bubblegum pink and lemon butter. In fact, they're so hot, Hush Puppies were just given the Fashion Accessory Award of the year by the prestigious Council of Fashion Designers of America. "They're the hippest, coolest shoe of the moment," said Fern Mallis, Executive Director of the Council. 
<P>Fashion designer John Barlett, who features Hush Puppies in his runway presentations, refers to them as quintessential American shoes. "They have great retro kitsch about them that appeals to me as this century comes to a close."
<P>Hush Puppies, introduced in 1958 by Wolverine World Wide Shoes, were perhaps the first true American casual shoes. Their comeback in the 90s is more than nostalgia--it's an acknowledgement that comfortable is cool and healthy is hip. This fall's line will sport a lot of two-toned oxfords. And get a load of these colors: gunsmoke, dawn white, hot pepper, wild violet, meadow mist, dark evergreen and of course, scarlet (the bright red shoe of 1958 was called scarlet feather).

<H2>Transform your heels</H2>
Pump Pals are extraordinarily comfortable insoles for women's shoes that work equally well in heels or flats. They're designed to absorb shock in the heel and ball of the foot, properly redistribute foot pressure, cushion delicate areas, and give extra arch support, making dress and business shoes comfortable all day long. (They helped get the editor of this magazine through 15 hours per day on her feet in dress shoes at the Las Vegas Shoe Show.) Though the design is sleek, we recommend buying shoes an extra half size larger to accommodate the insole. In fact, take the insole shopping with you, slip it into the shoe in question (without removing the covering over the self-adhesive backing) to guide you in choosing the correct shoe size. Pump Pals is one of a line of foot comfort products by Pedifix. Also check out their gel insoles and heel cushions. To order Pump Pals or to receive a free catalog and footcare booklet, call <B>1-800-PEDIFIX</B>.

<H2>Give slipping the slip</H2>
Amazingly, many dress shoes have pristine smooth leather outsoles. While you may not notice their slippery potential while trying them on in the shoestore, the first time you wear them,  you may be in for a nasty fall. Yes, eventually, a little sidewalk time will scuff up those polished soles and provide some traction, but why tempt fate? Many shoe stores carry a nifty $2 product called Sure Treds, self-adhesive ovals to apply directly to the forefoot sole of dress shoes, giving them instant traction that will not mar floors. Sure Treds are best applied to shoes before they are worn. Available in Sears, Macy's, Hess Shoes Stores and many other places where shoes are sold. 

<H2>Now for the back of your shoes
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n2/protect.jpg" WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="124" ALIGN="LEFT"></H2>
<P>Okay, your dress shoes are comfortable inside. You won't slip on a marble floor. Now you get in your car. And presto. By the time you get out, the heel and back of your expensive new shoes are scuffed, scratched and marred. Now they're just like all your other shoes--bearing those tell-tale cuts and scuffs that let everyone know you do a lot of driving. Enter a new little invention, a why-didn't-I-think-of-that kind of thing: Fralex Shoe Protectors. These clear, tough, acrylic gizmos slip onto any shoe providing a protective barrier between your shoes and the nasty floorboard of your car. They're the invention of Ron De Silva, who made the first pair for his wife and then was deluged by requests from her friends. Keep them in the accompanying carrying pouch in your car and slip them on when you slide into the driver's seat. They're clear, so you won't be too embarrassed if you forget to slip them off before dashing into a late appointment. Available in selected shoe stores and some Nordstrom shoe departments, or call <B>1-800-823-1430</B>.

<H2>Designer surgical shoes
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n2/best.jpg" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="162"></H2>

You can put your best foot forward at any formal function, even when that best foot has just come out of hammertoe surgery and is in a post-surgical shoe. How about a surgical shoe in black velvet trimmed with rhinestones, or an elegant beige linen post-op sandal? Or maybe your own custom design? Suzanne Levine, DPM, a Manhattan podiatrist, found that patients sometimes put off surgery because they dread the three or four months of clumping around in ugly post-surgical shoes. So for one skittish patient, a fashion editor with a busy social schedule, Levine created a special black velvet shoe. Levine's phone started ringing off the hook, and <B>Best Foot Forward, Inc.</B> was born. Its designer surgical shoes come in sandal and boot styles in various day and evening versions for about $250, with custom designs for $300. Beyond their surgical applications, the shoes are great for pregnancy, cardiac patients or diabetics with swollen feet, or even just hard-to-fit feet. Call Best Foot Forward at <B>1-800-624-3847</B>.


<H2>Show off your bones
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n2/sock2.jpg" WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="449" ALIGN="RIGHT"></H2>

Stretch on some warm, knee length socks and become an instant anatomy lesson. We're not talking about "the ankle bone's connected to the shin bone" here. We're talking tibia and fibula, not to mention your talus, lateral malleolus, calcaneus, and the 1st through 5th metatarsals. Brought to you by Anatomical Chart Co., a previously staid company that used to be responsible for nothing more than those colorful and precise anatomical charts on your doctor's wall. But now, heaven help us, they're offering everything from gigantic molar coffee mugs only a dentist could love to jello molds that deliver a quivering pile of anatomically correct brains to delight your fifth grade son. All that and more can be found in their catalog, <CITE>Brainstorms</CITE>, or at their very popular stores called Bare Bones located in the Mall of the America in Minneapolis, Woodfield Mall in Chicago, Paradise Valley in Phoenix and the World Trade Center Osaka, Japan. Call <B>1-800-231-6000</B> to receive a <CITE>Brainstorms</CITE> catalog. The bone socks come in white or black, and are being discontinued soon, so call now.


<H2>Keeping pace</H2>
A new series of fitness music tapes and CDs feature 30 to 40 minute programs of instrumental songs to fit your pace: moderate, brisk or fast. <CITE>"The Great Pace"</CITE> series is suitable for fitness walking, treadmill, stairclimbers, stationary bike or ski machine workouts. The series creator, Deb Feinberg, describes the tapes as "album-quality music from top musicians that is entertaining, motivating, with a strong, steady beat to get you going and keep you going from warm-up to cool-down." The three products accommodate different levels of aerobic conditioning: Country Rock for fast-paced workouts (144 beats per minute, 14-minute mile), Rhythm &#38; Blues for brisk-paced workouts (132 beats per minute, 16-minute mile) and Latin Jazz for moderate-paced workouts (120 beats per minute, 18-minute mile). Really useful is a slower-paced 5-minute warm-up at the beginning and a 5-minute cool-down segment at the end. To order or for more information, call <B>1-800-299-5792</B>.

<FONT SIZE=+3>Both hot and cold therapy can relieve pain and speed healing--when used in the right way at the right time.</FONT>
<P><I>by Diana Tonnessen</I>
</CENTER>
<P>You twisted your ankle while spiking your spouse during a volleyball game at a family reunion. You're down and it hurts. What should you do first: apply hot or cold compresses to the injury? 
<P>Three days later, the swelling has gone down but your ankle is still sore. What's the best therapy then: hot or cold?
<P>When used in the right way and at the right time, both hot and cold therapy can relieve pain and speed healing. The key is knowing when to use fire and when to use ice. The following guidelines should help. 

<H2>When to Use Cold Therapy</H2>
Cold therapy is recommended <I>during the first one to three days after an injury</I> (depending on its severity), in what's known as the "acute" phase of the injury. During this time, the blood vessels around the injured tissues open up, rushing blood, nutrients and fluids to the area to help the tissues heal, explains Karen Davis, a physical therapist and certified athletic trainer with Atlanta-based Physiotherapy Associates. The problem is that the increased blood flow often causes the healthy tissues surrounding the injury to swell and become inflamed. If swelling and inflammation aren't stopped or slowed, more extensive tissue damage may occur and the injury may take longer to heal. To add insult to injury, the additional fluids in the swollen tissues may press on nerves around the injury site, increasing pain. 
<P>Cold therapy reduces swelling and inflammation in a number of ways: it lowers the skin temperature, which helps to constrict (narrow) the blood vessels; it slows the metabolic rate of the injured tissues; and it slows the body's release of chemicals that dilate the blood vessels, further helping to reduce blood flow to the area. Cold therapy also numbs the injured tissues and reduces muscle spasms, both of which help to relieve pain. 
<P>You should be aware that cold therapy can't reverse any swelling that occurs before an injury is treated. But promptly treating an injury with cold therapy can help to reduce further swelling and inflammation of the surrounding tissues. Using heat during the acute phase of an injury is not recommended because it increases blood flow, which could aggravate swelling. 

<H2>Cold Therapy: What to Use</H2>
Cold therapy comes in many forms, including the following:
<P><B>Cold packs:</B> These are most practical for localized  strains and sprains because they can be easily contoured (molded) to the injured area of the body (such as around a knee or ankle) and are appropriate when it is also necessary to apply compression and to elevate the injury, both of which further reduce swelling. There are several different kinds of cold packs. The most basic: ice cubes or crushed ice in a sturdy plastic, rubber or moisture-proof fabric bag, such as an ice cap. Or use a bag of frozen peas or corn, which contours well to the injury.
<P>If you make your own ice pack with a plastic bag, use a sturdy gallon-size bag (a smaller bag will do for injuries to the fingers or toes), fill it about two-thirds full with ice (crushing the ice allows for better contouring), squeeze most of the air out of the bag, seal it shut, and place the bag directly on the injury. Elastic wraps or pillows can be used to secure the ice pack in place.
<P>Commercially manufactured cold gel packs work well, too, and have the advantage of being less messy than homemade ice packs. These cold packs are not the same as blue ice or other reusable ice packs designed for use in a picnic cooler. Rather, they are designed specifically for use on sports injuries and contain water, a gelatin or shredded paper to give the pack substance, and an antifreeze to keep the cold pack flexible, which allows for better contouring. The bags are reusable and many can be used for heat therapy, too. 
<P>Cold packs must be chilled in a freezer for several hours before being applied to an injury. But be forewarned: Because cold gel packs may reach temperatures far below freezing, they carry a much greater risk of frostbite than an ice pack, says Kenneth L. Knight, PhD, professor of athletic training at Indiana State University in Bloomington and author of <CITE>Cryotherapy in Sport Injury Management</CITE> (Human Kinetics, 1995). For this reason, cold gel packs should never be used for more than 30 minutes at a time, and most should not be placed directly on the skin. To reduce the risk of frostbite, place a damp towel or cloth between the pack and the skin, and limit the use of cold gel packs to five to 10 minutes at a time. <B>Never use picnic-cooler type cold packs on a sports injury: the risk of frostbite with blue ice is even greater than with cold gel packs.</B>
<P>Chemical cold bags are another option. These remain at room temperature until the bag is squeezed, which sets off a chemical reaction inside the bag that produces instant cold. The biggest drawback is that the degree of cold is not as intense as an ice pack and therefore the bags are not as effective as an ice pack in reducing swelling and relieving pain. Nor are chemical cold bags reusable. Another drawback: sometimes the bags break and the chemicals spill out, causing a chemical burn to the skin. Still, chemical cold bags are a good stand-in on a backpacking trip or whenever you don't have ready access to ice. They are often used by team coaches in the field, even during hot summer play. Because they do not reach extreme cold temperatures, the bags can be placed directly on the skin and may be used for up to 30 minutes at a time.
<P><B>Ice massage:</B> For superficial and/or small injuries close to the skin surface, such as tendons, bursae and myofascial trigger points, ice can be rubbed on the skin with a circular motion for a few minutes at a time (no more than five minutes). Ice cubes or small paper or Styrofoam cups filled with water and frozen may be used for ice massage. When using ice cups, peel away the top of the cup to expose the ice and apply holding the cup from the bottom. 
<P><B>Cold whirlpool or immersion bath:</B> A cold whirlpool or immersion bath, consisting of a slushy mixture of cold water and ice, may be recommended for large injuries or injuries located in deeper tissues of the body, according to Davis. A sprained ankle, for instance, may be placed in a slush bucket of ice water or a foot whirlpool. The only problem, points out Knight,  is that immersion of more than a single extremity at a time is too painful for most people to endure.

<H2>How Long to Apply Cold Therapy</H2>
A single cold treatment can last anywhere from five to 30 minutes at a time, depending on the depth of the injured tissue, the size of the injury and its location, says Davis. Deep tissues take longer to cool than surface tissues. So, for example, apply cold for a longer period of time to a hamstring strain than an ankle sprain. In addition, says Davis, "Because muscles have a high water content and are good heat conductors, and body fat has a low water content and is a bad heat conductor, a heavier person with more body fat will require a longer cold treatment than a thin person with the same injury." Another consideration: your own ability to tolerate the cold and your general comfort level. Since too much cold can lead to frostbite and possibly nerve damage, discontinue the treatment when your skin turns numb and don't reapply cold until after your skin has returned to a normal temperature. 
<P>Cold treatments should be repeated at regular intervals several hours apart during your waking hours for the first 24 to 72 hours after sustaining an injury, or until the swelling goes down.  

<H2>When to Use Heat Therapy</H2>
Heat therapy may be used on an injury after the swelling and inflammation subside--which is generally only after the first 72 hours, according to Lyle Micheli, MD, an orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine specialist at Children's Hospital in Boston. Heat therapy is also beneficial for soothing general aches and pains brought on by overexertion, adds Knight.
<P>Applying heat increases the skin temperature, causing blood vessels to dilate and increasing blood flow to the area. The increased blood flow and nutrients help to nourish injured tissues on the mend. Heat also can relieve muscle spasms and pain triggered by loss of blood flow to the area. Finally, heat treatments increase the elasticity of the connective tissue collagen, helping to decrease joint stiffness. Heat therapy is especially helpful in the treatment of torn muscles and tendons, but again, only after the inflammation and swelling have gone down.

<H2>How to Use Heat Therapy</H2>
Heat can be applied to an injury in a number of ways:
<P><B>Hot packs and heating pads:</B> Moist heat is better than dry heat for sports injuries because it penetrates deeper, says Dr. Micheli.  Commercially available moist heat packs are most effective. First, immerse the non-electric heat pack in extremely hot water (160 to 176 F). To avoid skin burns, wrap a towel around the heat pack before applying it to the injury. A single treatment can last for as long as 20 to 30 minutes. But as with cold therapy, you should let your comfort level be your guide as to how long the treatment lasts. 
<P>Under the direction of a doctor or physical therapist, you can make your own homemade moist hot packs by briefly heating wet towels in a microwave oven (for a minute at most), says Dr. Micheli. The biggest drawback to these homemade hot packs is that they quickly lose their heat and must be replaced every five to 10 minutes.
<P>Electric heating pads are another option. Although these produce "dry" heat, they can still effectively heat the injured area and increase blood flow.
<P><B>Whirlpools and immersion baths:</B> Water heated to 100-105F is helpful for stimulating circulation, soothing general aches and pains and promoting healing after an injury, either in a whirlpool or an immersion bath. A treatment can last from 20 to 30 minutes, depending on your comfort level.

<H2>Hot and Cold Caveats</H2>
You should be aware that hot and cold therapies are not for everyone. They should not be used in the very young and the very old. And if you have impaired blood circulation, hot or cold hypersensitivity, hypertension, and/or diminished or absent sensation, you should avoid hot and cold therapies.
<P>Generally speaking, use cold therapy to reduce swelling immediately after sustaining an injury. (To further reduce swelling and encourage healing during the first 24 to 72 hours, remember RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation.) Use heat therapy only after the swelling has subsided. And always seek the advice of a qualified medical professional before using either hot or cold therapy.

<H1>New Names in Replacement Insoles</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+3>Put new comfort in your older shoes--and even new shoes--with high-tech replacement insoles.</FONT>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Original insoles in many shoes are flat, lifeless and unsupportive. Lately, leading shoe manufacturers such as Ecco, Clarks and Soft Spots are pushing the edges of footwear technology to develop sophisticated insoles that will distribute weight, dissipate shock, support your body and promote good biomechanics. But even the best original insole will eventually bottom out or come apart. Now you can purchase high-tech replacement insoles to stand in for unacceptable original insoles, or for good insoles that have simply worn out.
<P>Replacement insoles run the price gamut from a few bucks for a Dr. Scholl's to $20 or better for a top of the line Sorbothane Ultra Sole. You can purchase replacement insoles at most drug stores, shoes retailers and sporting good shops, and they are dispensed by many biomechanics healthcare practitioners, such as orthopedists, physical therapists and podiatrists. Remember, with notable exceptions, these devices are essentially non-therapeutic. But they can make a real difference in your comfort level and in defending against the elements that help create foot pathology.
<P>Replacement insoles are nothing new. Dr. Scholl's has earned millions by making insoles inexpensive and abundantly available on retail racks everywhere. They made a real pioneering contribution to the public by leading the way toward better individual biomechanics. But today there are replacement insole offerings far beyond the simplistic devices produced by Dr. Scholl's. Companies such as Pedifix, Sorbothane, Implus, Kiwi, Spenco and many more have created highly engineered products that, while much less available and less visible in the marketplace, are certainly more desirable, in my personal view, than anything in the Scholl line. 
<P>Matching the correct insole to the correct shoe is not easy. Replacement insoles are mass-produced to hit the averages in human foot architecture and shoe construction. But every foot is different and so is every shoe. Original insoles are generally--with many notable exceptions--designed to be exceptionally thin. Not a few replacement insoles which deliver superior shock absorption are bulky, or at least thicker than the original. While a replacement insole may work well in an additional depth shoe, it may crowd your foot in a shallow depth shoe. The type and thickness of the sock or stocking is vital. Are you wearing hosiery with a Pump Pal, or sweat socks with a Superfeet? And of course, what activity is involved: work, running, walking, office routine, dress-up?
<P>The endless list of variables means that purchasing different insoles for different shoe and sock combinations and activities is imperative. Careful here. You can easily increase your discomfort by making the wrong match. Compression of the foot due to crowding from the wrong shoe-sock-replacement insole combination could actually lead to a serious foot problem. Fit is everything. Trimming the insole's tips to fit your shoe is a built-in expectation by many of the manufacturers. And don't laugh, but a lot of people actually think replacement insoles go on top of the old ones. So-called overlays do lay on top, but replacement insoles do not. So please, remember to remove or rip out the old insole before laying in the new one.
<P>If you're a diabetic, the rules change. You'll have to be extra careful about foot compression or injury due to an insole not fitting your shoe quite right. Make sure your doctor approves any insole.
<P>And, of course, a final caveat before reading my recommendations: the perfect comfort replacement insole for me may cause you pain--and vice versa. My preferences are based on my knowledge of the materials and construction, and my wear-testing. Your experience is guaranteed to vary.  Hence, my favorites are just that: my personal favorites for my personal foot under my specific shoe wearing conditions. That said: here is a selective guide to some of just a few of my favorites among the lesser known brands. 

<H2>Implus SofSole Athletes Plus</H2> 
These are wonderful on the feet and strangely enough, sweet to the nose. Implus is the high-tech company that accepted a crusading TV host's challenge to drop eggs onto its PVC-type insole material from 10 feet up. The eggs remained intact and Implus has been cashing in on the stunt ever since. 
<P>Implus material, an open cell breathable foam, absorbs up to 40 percent of ground forces transduced through a shoe, claims the company. Athletes Plus, its top of the line product comes with a full-length polyurethane layer, plus heel and metatarsal drops for added protection. Its perforated design allows for airflow. An impregnated biocide and sweet scent counteract foot odor. When I say "counteract foot odor," I mean these devices are so pleasantly scented that people can actually discern the fragrance as you walk by. I recommend Athletes Plus for any athletic activity, especially running or performance walking. Trim to size. <I>About $16.00.</I>

<H2>Kiwi AirPro</H2>
Kiwi uses a polyester foam on the bottom joined to an open-cell foam in the middle in a superior design to keep your foot cool under pressured circumstances, such as running or long sessions on your feet. An antimicrobial agent and hydrophilic moisture-wicking polyester fabric topcover combats foot odor. With thicknesses of just .34 inch at the heel, and .19 inch at the toe, AirPros are slightly thinner than similar products. A recessed "heel pump" converts heel strike into air flow that theoretically squirts through a system of channels and perforations to keep your foot cool and dry. I wore them around the office for eight hours, and my feet felt as cool and comfy by day's end as the moment I slipped into them. <I>About $12.95</I>

<H2>Pedifix SoftStride</H2>
My favorite all-around comfort insole is a product that has long been used successfully within the medical community and known simply as the Replacement Shoe Insole. 
<P>Pedifix is now adding this same medical quality replacement insole, renamed SoftStride, to its extensive line of retail foot care products. The SoftStride's exceptionally thin, molded full-length design will not crowd your toes. Two layers, urethane and polyethylene, are laminated beneath a soft polyester topcover, augmented by a small Poron heel insert for heel strike protection. The product may seem flimsy, but its durability depends upon use. Pedifix reports on and off use of a single pair for as long as two years. At the modest price, you can afford to replace SoftStrides annually. Check for Pedifix displays or call <B>800-424-5561</B> to locate SoftStride. If I have to pick one and only one, it's SoftStride. <I>About $14.95.</I>

<H2>SecondWind Cushioned Insole</H2>
If you want to experiment with a low-end, inexpensive molded polyurethane insole, SecondWind's basic Cushioned Insole is a good bet. I like it because it's so thin, it really mimics the footprint--excuse the expression--of the original insole. Its thickness is only 8.7 mm at the heel tapering to 4.5 mm under the ball of the foot and then 3mm at the forefoot. The SecondWind is extremely lightweight. Call it a disposable insole because the material will weaken within about 4-6 months. But then again you can buy one for the price of a movie ticket. SecondWind has an entire line of replacement insoles available at many retail outlets. <I>About $7-$8.</I>

<H2>Sorbothane II</H2> 
I like two Sorbothane II models. The Ultra Sole may be the best shock absorbing replacement on the market. The dense viscoelastic polymer controls, dissipates and isolates shock better than virtually any other product in its class. Added protection to the forefoot and heel has been designed in. Under lab conditions, this material can absorb up to 94.7 percent of impact, the company claims. It's my number one choice for shock absorption and shock attenuation. Skid pads on the bottom provide better in-shoe stability. Additional cushioning is afforded by a topcover of breathable Poron, the same material used to protect many sensitive diabetic feet. 
<P>The Ultra Graphite Arch or 3/4-length Graphite Arch is made of graphite, a plastic impregnated with carbon fibers, which is the same shock absorbing and foot supporting material many practitioners utilize in custom orthotics. A Dri-Lex moisture wicking layer tops off the device. 
<P>To avoid foot compression, Ultra Sole and Ultra Graphite Arch--both full-length--must be worn in shoes with fairly good depth, such as athletic shoes. Three-quarter length versions, with and without graphite, are available for dress and fashion shoes from IEM Medical Technologies, <B>800 992-6594.</B> <I>$15.95 to $30.00 depending upon the model and outlet.</I>

<H2>Spenco Orthotic Arch Support</H2> 
Occupies the high-end of the removable insole spectrum with a device that crosses the line from "high-end insole" to "low-end prefab orthotic." Why? Because the Orthotic Arch Support is a sturdy closed cell neoprene layer atop its own plastic-like Zytel arch support. The arch support is even heat moldable in two minutes with boiling water, so you can customize it to the shape of your foot. 
<P>Many healthcare practitioners, especially physical therapists and orthopedists, dispense this very product as a prefabricated orthotic, or recommend it to their patients as a temporary or low-end solution, or even a test orthotic prior to moving up to an actual prescription device. Not a few podiatrists use Spenco overlays as a cushioning topcover for hard plastic custom orthotics prescribed from a lab or fabricated in their office. 
<P>These devices are recommended when your feet really hurt, but if and when a practitioner advises. Remember, if you don't need a hard orthotic underfoot, hard Orthotic Arch Supports could cause a problem you didn't have before. And Orthotic Arch Supports are not a replacement for a therapeutic prefab or custom orthotic. Self-customizing without professional advice can create an adverse foot condition. 
<P>Spenco also makes a highly recommended line of lesser replacement insoles without plastic orthotic components. By the way, getting used to Orthotic Arch Supports will take some time. And you may sound like a duck until the plastic arch support is broken in. Some say a little baby powder can fix that. <I>About $22-$25.</I>

<H2>Spirakut Footfit</H2>
Talk about a neat product you never heard of. A little known Idaho company  named Spirakut has developed a wonderful Italian-produced insole called Footfit. Footfit is premolded heel to forefoot polyethylene melded to a full-length EVA layer, topped by either leather or hydrophilic (water absorbing) Cambrelle. A foam rubber heel pad is simply glued on and hopefully will not dislodge during rigorous use. 
<P>The secret of this product is its exquisite premolded heel cradling shape which provides comfort and support. I can wear it for hours unaware that it is in the shoe. Ironically, to make its product a success, this tiny company spent three years designing a snazzy retail box. And the package makes a real difference. While most retail insoles are sealed in a secure container (even those with an open "touch me" portal), the Footfit sits completely accessible in an open-face Velcro-fastened cardboard box. Spirakut urges customers to open the package and try a pair on to see how they fit. 
<P>Unfortunately, this product will not be available until fall, and only then in limited distribution at sports shops and maybe some drug stores. The company promotes them for in-line skating, skiing and other heavy-duty athletic uses. Spirakut will also sell them one pair at a time if you call <B>800-621-1657.</B> <I>About $15-$22 depending upon the model.</I>

<H2>Superfeet</H2>
Among the finest sports insoles is Superfeet, commonly available in general sports and ski shops. Like the Spenco orthotic device, Superfeet also offers a hard plastic support. Superfeet, however, utilizes a foam--rather than neoprene--for its full-length top layer. Wearing may take some getting used to. Even the company suggests spending a few weeks breaking them in, starting with four hours the first day, six hours the second day and so on. <P>Superfeet come in various versions targeted at running, skiing and in-line skating. Tough heel stabilizers help seat the device within the shoe. This is a support product, and one that is clearly targeted at the heavy-duty sports enthusiast. Choose the correct Superfeet and consult a practitioner, not just a store clerk. <I>About $20.</I>
<P>Replacement insoles help extend the life and comfort level of any shoe, and can help a reasonably healthy foot stay that way.

<H1>Some "Pointed" Remarks on Shoes</H1>

<P><I>by Mark W. DePaolis, MD</I>
</CENTER>
<P>Now that more women are going into medicine, it is just a matter of time before they deal with one of the most serious threats to female health and well-being: women's shoes.
<P>With medicine making exciting breakthroughs in DNA sequencing and visualizing actual brain activity, some people wonder why doctors would spend time worrying about shoes. The answer is simple: Everyone has feet. Women's shoes have been torturing and abusing their wearers for years. In a recent survey of healthy women, more than 80 percent complained of toe pain and deformity caused by their shoes. More than half of them had "bunions," causing the big toe to line up sideways like a teenager trying to parallel park.
<P>This is because women's shoes are purchased too small. They are much too  narrow, and they end in pointed triangles, which is not the original shape of anyone's feet. It is impossible to put five toes from a healthy, full-sized woman into a space the size of a Doritos-brand snack chip.
<P>Despite the pain, women continue to wear pointed-toe shoes for one reason: fashion. (Men do other stupid things to cause themselves pain, for instance having a hair transplant.) For some reason, it is fashionable for women to try to make their feet seem smaller. This is evidently some sort of turn-on for men, judging by the hundreds of "personals" ads desperately searching for SWF (small withered feet).
<P>Most people don't realize that their feet get bigger as they get older. They never use those metal slide-rule foot gauges found in shoe stores, probably because they look like some sort of live-hold traps. Instead, they just keep buying the same size shoes they wore in high school, which fit about as well as other clothing from that period.
<P>To illustrate my point, try this simple experiment: take five Lil' Smokies brand mini-sausages and push them into the toe of an average pointy, high-heeled women's shoe. (Normally I would recommend Lil' Smokies Lite, which contain less fat, but for this experiment any small, uncooked sausage product will do.) With all five Smokies in place, begin to exert downward pressure into the toe of the shoe using a kitchen mallet or other blunt object. One fact will be immediately clear: No one will ever want to wear this shoe again, and this is for the best.
<P>High heels make the problem even worse. They tip the foot forward, forcing women to walk on their toenails and further compressing the poor toes, shoving them even deeper into the Bermuda Triangle of pointy footwear. Wearing high heels is like balancing your entire body weight on a couple of pencils--a very unstable situation.
<P>As a doctor, I  have treated ankle fractures in women who fell off their shoes. These senseless, fashion-related injuries are one of the leading causes of ankle trauma, if you don't count stairways, all sports and teenagers who leave their enormous shoes untied with the laces trailing several yards behind them.
<P>To avoid these problems, women would be much better off wearing shoes of the proper size that are flat, roomy and supportive--basically, ugly shoes. The problem is where to find them. Shoe stores never display them in the front window, next to the snakeskin heels. They keep them in the back somewhere--I would not know where to look because, like many men, I never buy shoes. I already own a pair, which I will wear until they fall apart or I die, at which point someone will buy me new ones for the funeral.
<P>Fortunately, women know where to look. They are constantly shopping for shoes. They have hundreds of pairs, even though they have the same number of feet as men. They will sometimes--and I know this is true--buy new shoes while the last ones are still unworn in the box. The oldest, cast-off shoes are then moved to that ancient shoe burial ground, the back of the closet which may only be discovered years later by the next owner of the house.
<P>Luckily, they will probably never try to wear them, especially when they look inside and notice five small, disgusting lumps that might once have been mini-sausages. Like I said, it's for the best.

<H2>What causes heel pain?</H2>
Many different factors, including infection, arthritis, systemic disorders or nerve entrapment, can be involved. But the most common is sudden increased activity--running, walking or any athletic activity that strains the plantar fascia. We often see this during the spring and summer months when individuals start working in their yards or begin playing golf. Another factor is weight. Heel pain can occur in individuals of normal weight; it most often occurs in men over 200 lbs. and women over 170 lbs.

<H2>What is plantar fasciitis, more commonly called heel pain?</H2>
The plantar fascia is a thick, strong ligament in the bottom of the foot running from the heel bone towards the front part of the foot and then dividing into five branches, each attaching to the base of a toe. The plantar fascia supports the arch and helps elevate it during normal weightbearing. When the attachment of the ligament to the heel becomes irritated or inflamed through 
chronic strain, arthritis or overuse problems, then a condition known as plantar fasciitis, commonly known as heel pain, may occur. 


<H2>What can I do for relief?</H2> 
Since the most common cause of heel pain is mechanical in nature, first visit a good running shoe store and purchase an inexpensive pair of over-the-counter supports to place into a well-supported running or walking shoe (see <A HREF="/stride/v1n2/underfoot.html">Replacement Insoles</A>). Second, begin stretching exercises of the calf muscle. Third, try over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as Aleve, Advil, Motrin or even aspirin to help relieve pain. Fourth, wear a shoe that has a slightly higher heel. Flat shoes tend to aggravate heel pain. 
<P>If symptoms are not relieved within seven to 10 days, you should seek out a licensed practitioner who treats heel pain as a specialty.

<H2>What treatment should I expect?</H2>
If the patient has never been treated before or has a new problem, simple methods such as shoe modifications, stretching exercises and recommended over-the-counter supports may be all that is necessary. For those with a chronic problem, more aggressive treatments may be necessary. These could include cortisone injections, further modifications of shoes, custom orthotics, physical therapy and reduced activity.

<H2>What if initial treatment doesn't work?</H2?
Be patient. Heel pain can often take up to six to eight months to completely resolve. There is no quick cure and no magic spray. The most important factor is to reverse the conditions that caused the heel pain in the first place. If you are overweight, get on a weight reduction program. If you are presently on an exercise program such as running, switch to swimming or bicycling while your heel is on the mend. If your shoe needs modification, get it done. Follow instructions carefully and your chances for relief will be greatly enhanced without surgery. Our experience has shown that more than 85 percent of patients with heel pain resolve their symptoms within six months. Only about 10 percent have persistent pain and may be candidates for surgical treatment.

<H2>What kind of surgery might be necessary?</H2> 
Release of a portion of the plantar fascia is the most effective surgical treatment, whether performed through a small puncture incision or as an open surgical procedure. Success of plantar fasciotomy appears to be somewhere between 80 and 90 percent for those people who have failed to respond to non-surgical methods. Complications can occur, however, and the procedure is not to be taken lightly, nor performed prematurely before allowing a sufficient amount of conservative care and time.
 
<H2>How can I avoid developing heel pain in the first place?</H2>
First, make sure you are in the correct weight range for your height (see <A HREF="/stride/v1n2/loadoffsb2.html">How Much Should I Weigh?</A>). Second, when beginning an exercise program or increased activity, make sure you start out slowly rather than jumping right in. For instance, before it's time to begin mowing your lawn this summer, start walking on the grass for about 20 minutes per day to allow your ligaments and muscles to accommodate to this type of movement. 
<P>Stretching the calf muscle is very important, especially if you are over age 40. It should be as routine as brushing your teeth every day. In fact, that's probably a good time to stretch your calf muscle, while brushing your teeth. Just place one foot behind you and lean forward with your knee stiff and you will feel tightness at the back of the calf. Hold that position for 15 to 20 seconds and then repeat on each leg three times.
<P>Third, make sure you don't wear improper shoes two days in a row. I have personally experienced heel pain after standing all day seeing patients while wearing a particualr pair of Italian loafers (I know they are bad for my feet, but I can't throw them away because they cost so much). I make sure to wear a slightly higher heeled and better supported shoe the next day.

<H2>Could my heel pain be something more serious?</H2>
Heel pain is a common and often temporary problem. But if heel pain persists longer than seven to 10 days, evaluation by a foot and ankle specialist is important. Heel pain could be the first sign of another medical condition, such as arthritis or an infection. Only a qualified medical specialist can evaluate chronic heel pain and determine the origin, diagnosis and treatment program necessary to relieve your discomfort.

<H1>EuroComfort:
<BR>How European-style shoes changed the way Americans view comfort</H1>
<P><I>by Elizabeth Black</I>
</CENTER>

<P>The word "EuroComfort" entered the shoe lexicon in the mid-80s, and it meant, quite frankly, those clunky but supremely comfortable shoes certain Europeans wear--usually sandals with molded footbeds. In earlier decades these shoes were often referred to as orthopedic and admitting you wore them was akin to announcing you wore dentures.
<P>But EuroComfort took on an air of stylish snobbery as the shoe industry moved into the 90s. By now, EuroComfort is more than a trend, it's a movement. And it's hot. Some of the trendiest shoe boutiques carry nothing but European comfort shoes. 
<P>Shoes of the EuroComfort Movement are comfortable, handcrafted, expensive, and above all, they have Attitude. Major nameplates include Birkenstock, Mephisto, Dansko, Josef Seibel, Clarks, Naot, and a host of lesser knowns such as Rieker, Wolky, Loint's, Theresia, Rott, and Baer. 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n3/wolky.jpg" WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="114" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Wolky's New Roman sandals">
<P>Of course the baby boomer generation was the first to stumble across European-style comfort. In the 60s, a hitchhiking pilgrimage through Europe was synonymous with "finding oneself." Hoofing it across Europe was good for the soul, but it was punishing on soles. Those with extra cash found relief in fashionably unfashionable European comfort shoes. (Some of us cash poor folk such as my husband and I, who spent a memorable six-month honeymoon backpacking through the continent, relied on our crepe-soled, well-worn, very American Hush Puppies). 
<P>My friend Carol Kimmel discovered EuroComfort in 1968. Carol was a Chicago actress, a good one, who could become whatever part she played--coquettish to commanding. But when Carol was being Carol, she was either barefoot or wearing Birkenstocks. Carol picked up her first pair of Birkenstock sandals during her travels in Europe. Unwilling to give them up when winter hit Chicago, she wore her Birkenstocks with thick wool socks. The day Carol discovered that a certain health food store in Chicago sold Birkenstocks, she ascended to seventh heaven. 

<H2>Thank You, Margot</H2>
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n3/margot2.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=258 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Margot Fraser">
Carol and loyal Birkenstockers have Margot Fraser to thank for bringing EuroComfort to America. A Californian of German descent, in 1966 Margot was vacationing in a health spa in Germany and complained of aching feet. 
Someone suggested Birkenstocks. She tried them, and she and her Birkenstocks became inseparable. The chronic foot pain she had lived with for years vanished within a couple of months, and Margot enthusiastically recommended the shoes to her friends. Soon she found herself placing orders for shoes from Germany. One thing led to another and she decided to import the shoes to America. She now heads a California-based organization of 145 enthusiastic employees who oversee Birkenstock distribution in more than 2,000 retail outlets in the U.S., selling more than two million pairs of shoes annually. 
<P>Birkenstock USA, the organization Margot founded, turned 30 this July. "Looking back at 1966, I realize what tremendous odds we faced," says Fraser. "The concept of health and fitness was not as widely accepted as it is today. Birkenstocks were truly a revolutionary product."
<P>The Birkenstock family had been crafting shoes for many generations. Church archives in a small German village list Johann Adam Birkenstock as a shoemaker. His grandson Konrad Birkenstock designed the first shoe last with a contoured insole in 1897, and the first flexible arch support as an insert for factory-made shoes in 1902. When Karl Birkenstock joined the family business in 1954, he was not content merely to supply other shoe manufacturers with "footbeds"--a term the family registered in 1933--but threw himself into designing a shoe that would incorporate the flexible footbed and contoured arch support notions of his grandfather. By 1965, the classic Birkenstock sandal had become a reality.

<H2>BirkenPhilosophy</H2>
The Birkenstock shoe design philosophy simply put is: form follows function. Birkenstocks are contoured to match the shape of the foot, and designed to allow feet to stand and walk as if on soft, yielding earth. So the footbed recreates the shape of a footprint in soft, damp sand, cradling the foot. As you wear them, the shoes adapt to the shape of your feet, with the insole literally becoming your footprint. That's because the insole or "footbed" is made of natural cork sandwiched between layers of a soft suede top cover and jute, which wicks away moisture. The molded heel cup cradles and provides extra padding directly under the heel bone. When you walk barefoot on a beach, your toes grip the sand for balance and support. So the characteristic Birkenstock toe bar is shaped to encourage your toes to grip as you walk, improving circulation and exercising feet and legs. And of course the shape of the shoe is broad, giving toes all the room they need to function in maintaining balance and motion. The footbed also includes a well-defined arch, and unlike shoes with elevated heels, the Birkenstock heel is "neutral," enabling all the bones in the feet to bear weight as nature intended.  
<P>Birkenstock's best-known model is the Arizona, the familiar sandal with two adjustable straps, followed by the Milano model, which adds a back strap. The popular Florida features three straps. The line has expanded to 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n3/birk.jpg" WIDTH="118" HEIGHT="66" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Birkenstock's Florida model">
include a much wider variety of sandal styles, clogs, and closed-toe shoes as well. Polyurethane BirkiClogs with removable contoured footbeds are the rage for casual wear and gardening. Kids' sandals in bright, crayon colors are delightful. Some adult and children's styles feature Birko-Flo uppers, a synthetic with the durability and breathability of leather. But the Arizona, Milano, and Florida still outsell all other models.

<H2>Footprints in the Sand, Israeli-Style</H2>
Birkenstock's relatively recent focus on fashion is, some say, playing catchup to an Israeli shoe manufacturing company which has pushed the cork molded footbed concept well beyond Europe's wildest dreams. Israelis live in sandals year-round. Even the soldiers of the Six-Day War marched into battle in crude leather sandals. Whether on the sand dunes of the Negev desert or the beaches of Tel Aviv, until 15 years ago Israeli footwear seemed to have changed little from the days of the Roman sandal. The average Sabra wore a tire-tread-soled contraption with a flat, shapeless leather footbed held to the foot by dark, coarse brown leather straps, usually dry, cracking, dust-covered, and looking for all the world like an antique surviving from the first millennium. That is until a Galilee kibbutz, Naot Mordachai, took the Birkenstock-style footbed, narrowed it slightly, added latex "memory foam" for a softer, more flexible feel, and began creating the Middle East's most comfortable and stylish sandals. Although it had been manufacturing shoes since 1942, its sandals didn't really catch on with the Israeli public until the late 70s when Naot added colors and ventured into a more fashionable look.
<P>As usual, it was an American on a self-discovery sojourn in another country who decided there was a market for these shoes in America. New Yorkers Steve and Susan Lax had met, married, and begun a family in Israel, living on Kibbutz Gezer, where they were introduced to easy sandal living. After they moved back to Long Island, they founded Yaleet, an importing company in 1990. Naot's "nature sandals" were a perfect starting point. But how to convince the American public of the joys of the footprint in the sand? Steve chose to stay away from traditional shoe stores, instead targeting specialty shops and boutiques, health food stores, leather stores, country stores, even bicycle shops--places where people with a strong interest in health, fitness, and comfort might congregate. It worked. 
<P>Naot, ironically, has enjoyed a thriving distribution in Europe for many years, essentially importing the footbeds built to their specifications from Europe, then giving them back with colors and upper styling pizazz which until recently was lacking in the European comfort market. In an attempt to stay current, Naot recently has adopted a compromise view that most European comfort manufacturers have been unwilling to do. Many Israelis are highly influenced by the latest European shoe fashion trends. "Naot tries to redefine fashion. Our designers will look at a popular shoe," explains Lax, "and say, now that's unhealthy. How can I make that particular style healthier?" Then working like an illusionist, Naot creates a relatively healthy version of say, a clunky heeled sandal, finding a way to make it less high and more comfortable. But uncompromising comfort sandals are still Naot's mainstay. 
<P>For the first time, this year the company sold more Naots in America than in Israel. The Tahoe thong-style sandal is one of Naot's best sellers in America, and Tahoe wearers are totally hooked on both look and feel. I won't take mine off in fall until my toes freeze.

<H2>Just Add Hand Stitching and a Little Air</H2>
The Josef Seibel family has been continuously crafting footwear in Germany for more than 110 years. Still family-owned and operated, Josef Seibel designs and manufactures sandals, boots, and shoes with careful attention to detail and handcraftmanship. A Seibel shoe starts with an anatomically-aware sculpted footbed characteristic of all the EuroComfort companies, but adds its comfort signature--a patented Air Massage system, which consists of a lightweight, durable one-piece unit designed to address comfort in two ways. A system of channels and ducts circulate air to ventilate the foot, while so-called "nubbles" massage the foot during gait. 
<P>Seibel's soles may be New World, but their soul is Old World. The uppers are attached to the outsole using classic European needle and thread handsewing methods. "Each pair requires 30 to 40 minutes or more to hand stitch," assures John Swenson, whose company exclusively distributes Seibel shoes in the U.S. and Canada. Why do they go to such trouble? "It adds strength, flexibility and a distinctive look," he explains.
<P>Seibel shoes are well suited for stand-and-work occupations, such as tellers, clerks, or chefs. And because they're lightweight, Seibels are great for travelling. The "nubbly" massage therapy feels good when you first change into them, but the textured footbed may drive you crazy if you try to wear these shoes for long periods of time. I find them a welcome relief when I come home from work, but I'm ready to kick them off after an hour.
  
<H2>Dancing in Denmark</H2>
Dansko and Ecco are Denmark's leading contributors to the EuroComfort circle. Dansko has long manufactured comfort clogs with wonderful arch support and shock absorption that are particularly popular with nurses and 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n3/rott.jpg" WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="104" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Rott sandals, distributed by Dansko, give EuroComfort a dressier look">
chefs. But Dansko also exclusively distributes German-made Rott sandals which bring dressier, softer, strappier designs to the traditional cork bottom contoured EuroSandal. The Rott sandal features interchangeable insoles and therefore can accommodate a prescribed orthotic. Rott has also refined the traditional sandal innersole, offering narrow and medium widths. But buyers of Rott need to make sure they aren't compressing their feet unnaturally in order to acquire that "narrower" look. The whole point of the wider EuroComfort footbed is to allow feet to move and spread out naturally as you walk. 
<P>Ecco, also of Denmark, offers plenty of feel-good philosophy with their comfort shoes. The company's best cork-insole sandal, the Cosmo, features Velcro-fastening, adjustable straps, and a rugged but lightweight outsole.
  
<H2>The Mephisto Waltz</H2>
Only 30 years old, but dedicated to comfort from its inception, Mephisto of France quickly became a moving force in the comfort shoe movement. Mephisto specializes in walking and hiking shoes but offers sandals as well. Its proactive environmental approach shuns synthetics whenever possible, uses only vegetable-dyed leathers (to avoid harmful chemicals) and pure latex and rubber for soles because those are renewable resources.
<P>As with other EuroComfort companies, Mephisto designs offer plenty of foot room. "Toes must have a great degree of freedom, not locked in against each other," explains Allan Ronc, director of Mephisto USA. "The same thing applies at the heel end of the foot. There is absolutely no need for the heel to fit tight. The point is, your foot should be cradled, not bound," he adds. To that end, Mephisto features midsole embedded anti-shock and air circulation systems. 
<P>But Mephisto likes to emphasize durability, claiming many customers still wear models purchased 15 to 20 years ago. When American-purchased Mephistos require resoling, the company provides new soles, laces, and lining for a small fee. 
<P>Mephisto's greatest markets are France and Germany. From its start-up in 1965, it began exporting to Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Four years later it entered the British and Scandinavian markets. Mephisto reached America in 1987 at the beginning of the EuroComfort invasion, and quickly found its niche here.
  
<H2>English, Dutch and Even Americans</H2>
Across the English Channel, two Puritan brothers, Cyrus and James Clark, began making shoes in 1825 in the small town of Street in Somerset, England. As one would expect from Puritans, the shoes were practical, well-made, durable, and...well, maybe not so comfortable. But today, Clarks of England creates the most comfortable shoes in Great Britain. And they're 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n3/clarks.jpg" WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="113" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Clarks of England's Sunbeat sandals in the popular shade of blueberry">
taking America by storm. "Clarks' blue three-strap sandal (Springer's Sunbeat) practically walks out the door," says Alan Singer of Singer Shoes in Chicago which specializes in EuroComfort brands. Marketing director of Clarks' American company, Annie Adams, confirms that the Sunbeat is its best selling comfort sandal in America. "It now comes in 14 colors, ranging from blueberry to tan patent crocodile." Clarks' sandals feature an accordian style heel with spring to it, and insoles that are more flexible than many of the traditional European sandals. In Great Britain, Clarks has long distinguished itself by shodding certain streetwise professions such as policemen and firemen. But now its industrial-strength shock absorption, durability, and comfort fit have been translated into its general consumer lines as well.
<P>Today, the EuroComfort Movement is so diverse, no one country dominates the category. Rieker, Baer, FinnComfort, and Theresia are all from Germany. Loint's and Wolky both hail from the Netherlands. There isn't enough space to list them all. Each brand offers its own special comfort contribution, sprinkled with generous amounts of foot health philosophy. And they all share a common commitment to quality, craftsmanship, and anatomical integrity. But be advised: EuroComfort comes with a price tag that reflects the quality. Prices range from $90 to $400 per pair. In fact, if EuroComfort is offered for under $90, the consumer should be suspicious.
<P>In many ways, the EuroComfort movement spawned the AmeriComfort movement of the 90s after the first waves of EuroComfort reached our shores in the previous decade. American manufacturers are more than copycats; they are trying to supply the one ingredient missing from most EuroComfort lines: sizes and widths. It's sometimes said that many European comfort shoes come in three widths: wide, wide, and wide. In fact, length is accommodated by scaled up size increases. This one-width-sorta-fits-all notion seems all wrong for the melting pot feet of America.
<P>The St. Louis-based NaturalSport company is a good example of European influence meeting American ingenuity. It recently introduced the EuroWalker, so named because it is "European influenced, but only when it comes to styling," explains NaturalSport's Director of Marketing, Pat Williams. EuroWalkers come in sizes four to 12 in narrow, medium, and wide widths. "With these EuroWalkers, NaturalSport is giving half-sizes and widths for a more precise fit, something consumers have never been able to get before," says Danny Wasserman, owner of Tip Top Shoes in New York City. 
<P>Soft Spots Supremes, a brandname of the very American H.H. Brown Company, has introduced a European-style sandal (in four widths and seven sizes) which adds yet another step to the comfort level. The sandal, called Transpose, comes with two removable and interchangeable footbeds. One is higher density for walking and high activity, the other is softer for relaxing and less activity. The footbeds are washable. A clog-style shoe offers the same features.
<P>Why did the comfort movement first bloom in Europe? You won't see EuroComfort parading down the runways of Paris or Milan. And you'll find just as many, perhaps more, women in Rome or Frankfurt teetering dangerously across cobblestone streets in fashion shoes. But there is also an outspoken minority of practical, fashion-be-damned women in European countries who rely on their feet for basic transportation and are self assured enough to insist on comfort. Furthermore, Europeans tend to buy quality, not quantity. They'll pay for expensive shoes because they know they'll last. What else would you expect from people who live in and carefully maintain residences that can date back 300 years? None of this impulsive, throw-it-away when tired of it mindset that has characterized the post-50s American consumer. 
<P>My generation had to smuggle EuroComfort back in their suitcases. Our children purchase EuroComfort in the trendy shops of Georgetown, SoHo, or Chicago's Magnificent Mile. At the turn of the 21st century, on both sides of the Atlantic, it's finally okay to say, "I'll wear what pleases my feet."

<H2>The BirkenScans</H2>
Now you can have custom Birkenstock sandals, perfect for those with hard-to-fit feet or those who need to wear foot orthotics. A high-tech orthotic company called Benefoot has created technology allowing patients, whose footwear choices would otherwise be restricted to closed shoes, to enjoy the comfort of sandals. Initially, the Benefoot/Birkenstock line will include three of the most popular styles: Arizona, Milano, and Florida. Your doctor can order sandals by sending a plaster or foam impression of your foot to Benefoot. Some doctors have a Benefoot foot scanner that 
captures laser impressions of the foot which can be modemed to create the sandals. In fact, Benefoot is using the same technology to create custom shoes for the Custom Foot retail chain. This new development brings EuroComfort full circle. Ironically, high tech advances have made it possible to do what the cobblers of the Middle Ages once did--make custom shoes for individual feet.

<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n3/yel.jpg" WIDTH=110 HEIGHT=210 ALIGN="LEFT">Lyle Harris, a Dallas beverage delivery driver, limped into Dr. Walter's office complaining that his knees buckled when he carried an air conditioner to his bedroom window. Dr. Walter's examination found knee instability. He prescribed a knee brace, some heat therapy, a prescription for Naprosyn, and then advised Lyle to "take it easy" on weekends.
<P>  Joanne Haines, a Chicago retail clerk who recently took up running on weekends, made a lunchtime appointment to see Dr. Rawlings. Her complaint: heel pain after running. Dr. Rawlings asked Haines numerous questions about her running style and track, and even examined her shoes. He offered some suggestions on warming up, pacing herself, and then prescribed a foot orthosis.
<P>  Both patients walked out satisfied. But the fact is both patients are candidates for a return visit with similar complaints. Why? Because more than likely, their workplace experience is the central cause of their lower extremity problem. Yet neither doctor asked about their workplace experience. 
<P>Indeed the workplace is all too often overlooked as a dominant factor not only in foot and leg problems, but also in lower back problems. Many would also add head-to-toe injuries resulting from slips and imbalance because the kinetic chain of human movement does not magically stop at the hip. Lower back problems affect gait. Knee instability or imbalance causing a slip and fall results in head, wrist, and shoulder injuries. Being on the beat in America's diverse workplace means understanding that the lower extremity is the foundation of normal activity. Mess with it and you're asking for trouble all along the system.
<P>  The federal government counted 2.3 million workplace injuries and illnesses in a limited 1992 Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of key industries. Nearly 19 percent were caused by slips, trips, and falls. Accidents, fatigue, repetitive stress, and other factors accounted for 446,000 lower extremity injuries, of which more than 148,000 occurred to the knees, 69,000 to the feet, and 33,000 to the toes. Strains and sprains were the leading injury.
<P>  But these numbers are vastly understated. First, the survey was confined to certain blue collar workplaces, such as manufacturing and trucking. The pink and white collar professions weren't included. Second, the government doesn't even start counting injuries and illnesses until the employee takes time off from work. This means the working wounded of every collar are excluded. 
<P>  Moreover, the numbers overlook slip and recover incidents, such as Joe Worker, who, while carrying a box, loses his footing and then recovers his balance, or never actually hits the ground. Or maybe he does hit the ground but then dusts off his ego and keeps on truckin'. His back and legs have been strained. His muscles and skeleton have been weakened. Maybe a little, maybe a lot. Legitimate automotive whiplash cases typically manifest days--even weeks--after the accident. But the same approach to symptoms and rehabilitation is not applied to the numerous whiplash-like incidents that befall American workers day in and day out.
  
<H2>Risky Business</H2>
Are cumulative injuries and weakenings being overlooked in what seems to be a non-work-related problem? On the weekend, Joe Worker lifts the lawnmower into position and his legs or back give out. Was it the lawnmower, or was it the cumulative result of a back and legs weakened at work? "Most healthcare providers who see people with lower extremity pain not specifically injured at work per se tend to not ask a lot of questions about work," confirms Stuart Weinstein, MD, a Seattle physiatrist specializing in rehabilitation. "Doctors are busy and don't want to complicate the issue," he adds. "If a person presents with a running injury, we don't ask questions about the workplace. The reality is, very little is known about the lower extremity in the workplace."
<P>  Workplace vulnerability appears to begin with an inherited predisposition to react to surfaces and other environmental risks. In other words, everyone brings strengths and weaknesses to the workplace before they even work their first day. This concept is hardly new for the upper extremity. Orthopedic surgeons treating carpal tunnel explain that the extent of any possible damage depends upon the individual. For some wrists, the person can go years and never experience the syndrome. For others, a few months will bring it on.
<P>  "A person can be born with a minor leg abnormality, but if you're standing on it for eight hours every day, it can become a major problem," explains Kenneth Holt, PT, a workplace specialist at Boston University's Physical Therapy Department. 
<P>  Three workplace risk factors can affect the lower extremities of all individuals: trauma, exposure, and stress. Inherited characteristics and lifestyle predispose individuals to react to these risk factors differently.
<P>  Too often, employers do not consider risk factors affecting the lower extremity as they do those concerning the upper extremity. For example, the boss asks the big guy, not the skinny fellow, to carry the 100-lb. bag of cement. But no employer thinks twice about asking the slender woman with weak ankles to stand all day behind a jewelry counter, or a waitress to walk 20 or 30 miles in a shift. But if they did, they would discover five work modalities that can make a difference: surface, environment, seating, foot and leg gear, and task. 
  
<H2>Scratching the Surface</H2>
Floor and surface ergonomics is still a relatively unknown science. Common sense dictates that it is easier to stand on a soft surface than a hard one. Architects have long understood this anecdotally. But now, engineers, such as Mark Redfern, PhD, are attempting to quantify flooring properties and correlate them to biomechanics. Dr. Redfern identifies three distinct central issues: slip and fall, balance, and fatigue or stress. 
<P>  Slipping and falling begins as a lower extremity incident, but by the time a worker hits an object, there can be full body trauma. Construction and manufacturing have the highest slip and fall rates because of their surface conditions. Construction sites offer profoundly unstable, uneven surfaces. Manufacturing plants feature spills and dust on concrete floors, as well as flooring transitions with different slip characteristics, such as entrances to offices or bathrooms.
<P>  "But no occupation--including office work--is immune," asserts Dr. Redfern. "There are a number of cases where coffee and water cooler spills are the predominant cause of ankle sprains. But marbled and ceramic-tiled entrance ways of office buildings are also dangerous after snow or rain, especially to women in high heels."
<P>  Industries are now designing flooring to reduce slips and falls. More than that, biomechanists such as Dr. Redfern are measuring the shoe-floor coefficient of friction for various surfaces and relating them to various biomechanical tasks. "Yet the coefficient of friction in their workplace is something few doctors will ask a patient about," confirms Dr. Weinstein. 
<P>  By way of information, "Normal gait generally requires a minimum coefficient of friction of .25 or .3," says Dr. Redfern, "but many consider .5 to include a margin of safety." Engineers measure the coefficient by dragging shoe material across various surfaces. Hard and fast conclusions are unwise, warns Dr. Redfern. Leather is more slippery than crepe, but crepe soles can be more slippery on oily surfaces.
  
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n3/grn.jpg" WIDTH=106 HEIGHT=210 ALIGN="LEFT">
<H2>Not Too Hard, Not Too Soft</H2>
Fatigue or stress is a second major concern, especially for those, such as factory workers or quality control inspectors, who must work on their feet within a confined space. Often this space is a tough surface, such as concrete or industrial-grade tile. But a cushioned mat underfoot can make a major difference, as every checkout cashier knows.
<P>  In 1989, Dr. Redfern studied 14 similar workers confined to a 20 sq. ft. work zone. The workers were given cushioned mats of various materials and thicknesses, and then recorded their anecdotal sense of fatigue. The workers declared they could indeed tell the difference, and that the mats helped. However, there is a happy medium for optimal cushiness. Too much plushness can create discomfort. Studies using carpeting of different pilings reinforce this notion. Low, firm piled carpeting gives better EMG results than plush carpeting.
<P>  Plush carpeting carries more than just a greater fatigue risk. Studies show that when elderly people walk on very plush carpeting, they suffer balance problems that interfere with their normal gait and maneuverability, says Dr. Redfern. Many elderly people work in older offices, and indeed live in homes with older plush carpeting. Their risk is more than simply being off balance, says Dr. Redfern. If they fall, they can easily sustain serious cuts and fractures.
 
<H2>Take a Seat</H2>
Another critical modality is seating. Slouched, unsupported, or too low a seating arrangement can have the expected effects on the spinal column. But the way the thighs meet the seat cushion edge is also of concern to ergonomic engineers. Long distance bus drivers and pilots, as well as telephone operators and editors, are among those who must sit for long periods of time. If that seat is too high, it can compress the bottom of the thigh and reduce the flow of blood to the lower extremities.
<P>  "Chronic compression from long-term improper seating can certainly affect the bundle of vascular structures and nerves in the thigh," explains Richard Matterson, MD, a physiatrist and senior vice president and medical director of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington, D.C. "For the average person, that may be no problem. But if you have arterial sclerosis, it can push you over the edge." He adds, "The greater the surface of contact, the less force per inch the thigh sustains."
<P>  Sudden activity levels for those who are seated during work can also have an impact because the body is simply not as prepared. This is a major worry for long distance bus drivers who must drive for hours, then suddenly descend steps and begin moving baggage around.
<P>  Proper seating is de rigueur for all who make a living on their backsides. "Lower back problems and circulation problems lead to the patient who can't walk as far, stand as straight, lift as much, or in general keep as fit," asserts Dr. Matterson. "Yet studies show that if a person keeps fit and works fit, he/she can last a 'work lifetime' and keep up."
  
<H2>The Right Shoe</H2> 
Protective and accommodative shoe gear is another mediator of trauma, exposure, and stress. 
<P>  The U.S. Postal Service is one of the few industries that requires shoes to be tested for work use. Prescribed shoe gear specs are in every postal employee's pocket safety pamphlet and every supervisor's manual. The rules are enforced. But most other industries or organizations simply pay lip service to shoe selection. A Montgomery County, Maryland, policeman says proper shoe gear to sustain pavement shock was stressed when he was in the academy; but when he joined the force, he made his own shoe decisions. An Albany, New York, grocery store delivery driver says work shoes were supposedly required by the company, but on weekends he wore sneakers for comfort because "nobody checked."
<P>  The benefits of proper shoe gear are proven day in and day out throughout the American workplace. A recent study of high-risk workers showed that 66 percent of injured workers were wearing protective shoe gear. But 85 percent of those injuries occurred at the unprotected portion of the shoe. 
<P>  Over time, an entire industry of protective and supportive shoe wear has developed. Protective shoes, such as those made by Red Wing, are well known. Less well known are supportive work clogs, made by such companies as Dansko and Hamill, for nurses and others who work on their feet. Dansko has even added a fashionable touch to make its product more appealing and less clinical. 
<P>  Once the foot has become injured or deformed, the patient may become a customer of Acor Orthopedic, which manufactures prescription custom protective non-skid shoes. They can accommodate orthoses and meet the Class 75 standards of the American National Standards Institute. More than 2,000 pairs were sold last year to orthopedic surgeons, podiatrists, and physical therapists.
<P>  Unfortunately, few companies are even assessing the shoe requirements for women in office environments. Few beyond airline attendants are insisting they wear intelligent footwear. Yet, 80 percent of the bunionectomies performed are on women who suffer from ill-fitting shoes primarily worn in the workplace. The unwillingness of corporate America to butt heads with fashion is a collective gripe of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society. AOFAS has championed the cause of safe shoes and has even advocated that fashion shoes be labeled with AOFAS warnings akin to cigarette warnings.
 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n3/purp.jpg" WIDTH="104" HEIGHT="210" ALIGN="LEFT">
<H2>Tasking the Body</H2>
Of course, the dominant factor influencing the lower extremity in the workplace is the task. How workers stand, sit, lift, carry, squat, stoop, walk, and run determine which seating and shoes are needed to match the physical predisposition of the foot. Very few companies make the effort to tell their employees how to lift or carry. The U.S. Post Office and UPS do. But certainly, no law firm advises legal assistants on how to lug heavy records boxes from the file room floor to the conference room. No executive office instructs employees on how to lift heavy reams of fax and copy paper. Yet these tasks are exactly what causes lumbar, knee, and ankle instability. Just who can undertake what job tasks and under what conditions and with what protective devices is a question that suggests mass screening in the workplace, so long as that screening is non-exclusionary. But industry simply is not yet willing to invest in lower extremity ergonomics as it has in upper extremity movement. Why? Because the lawsuits have not yet started. 
  
<H2>What You Can Do</H2>
If your workplace is hard on your lower extremities, what can you do to make it biomechanically safe and friendly? 
<P>  Don't wait for corporate America to come to grips with occupational health from the ground up. You can improve your own lot by becoming more aware of the loads you carry and the surfaces you traverse. Are you asking for a fall by lugging filing boxes over marble floors while wearing heels? Do you bend at the knees properly when lifting? Are you wearing shoes with ample cushioning and shock absorption on cement floors? Do you use the hand rail while climbing stairs? Much is common sense. Put a cushioning mat on the spot where you do prolonged standing. Don't lock your knees when standing--keep them slightly bent. Use your head when choosing footwear for work. But most important, check with doctors and other biomechanical experts on ways to make work kinder on your feet, legs, knees, hips, and back. Describe your workplace situation and habits to a professional who can help you assess ways to either change or cope with your work environment. Occupational physical therapists and physiatrists, for instance, can offer advice and training on how to prevent injuries as well as rehabilitation after an injury. Most of all, encouarge ergonomic awareness in your company and coworkers.
<P>  Until lower extremity biomechanical health is addressed, America's workforce will continue to spend its days on the job becoming patients. And this will continue to affect profits as well as lives. Being on the beat shouldn't mean sacrificing one's biomechanical health. As of today, it often does, but you can help change that.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Walk it Off!</FONT> PART TWO</B>
<H1>Designing Your Walking Program</H1>

<I>by Suzanne Levine, DPM</I>
</CENTER>

<P>  In the last issue of <CITE>Stride</CITE>, I told you how, in 1984, I discovered the benefits of a regular walking program and how it literally changed my life. Walking improved my mood and reduced stress; it gave me energy and made me a healthier person. Walking stimulates the heart, lungs, and muscles and increases the circulation of the blood so that it benefits every organ of the body. Furthermore, it helped me lose 60 lbs., something no other form of exercise had done for me. 
<P>  Can walking work for you as it did for me? I believe walking is the exercise answer for many types of people: the nonathletic; the over-35 crowd; those with medical problems; those who don't like to exercise; and those with very busy, unpredictable schedules. But is walking "real" exercise? Indeed it is, and more and more doctors are finding that it is also the safest, most agreeable, and most accessible exercise they can recommend to their patients. 
<P>  In part one of this series, I asked you to get out of your chair and explore your neighborhood--take some sample walks to discover when and where you would like to walk, and to choose comfortable walking clothes and shoes. Now it's time to declare yourself "ready" to launch a regular, consistent walking program. This consists of the following steps:
<UL><LI>Make a commitment to walk at least four times a week and decide when during the day it's easiest for you to do it.
<LI> Choose a walking level (beginner, intermediate, or advanced) and follow the <A HREF="#table2">table</A> to gradually increase your time and distance.
<LI>Learn the seven simple <A HREF="/stride/v1n3/stretchsb.html">stretching</A> exercises and use them as a three-minute warmup prior to your daily walk.</UL> 
  
<H2>Before the Walk: The 3-Minute Stretch</H2>
Why stretch? For one thing, if you do it right (gently, slowly, kindly, to music if you like) it feels good! Anyone who has ever watched a cat waking from a nap has observed the kind of sensual pleasure that stretching can bring.
<P>  Stretching helps make walking a pleasant, pain-free experience. When we walk we're working our muscles against the force of gravity. Muscles work by tightening, contracting, getting shorter. Stretching lengthens and loosens the muscles and gets them ready to work. Stretching is especially important if you haven't exercised in quite a while, because it can save you aches and pains later on. And it's also important for energetic, advanced walkers to help avoid pain, shin splints, ligament injuries, and arthritis.
<P>  But like anything else, stretching can be overdone. Remember: always stretch with a slow, smooth, relaxed movement. Jerking, bouncing, bobbing, or pulling on your muscles can do more harm than good. And don't hold your breath. Slow, steady breathing will help your muscles relax.
 
<H2>Your Walking Level</H2>
Should you start out at the beginner, intermediate, or advanced walking level? If you're over 45, have done little or no exercise for more than a year, get out of breath from climbing two flights of stairs, or have a serious health problem, you should start out at the beginner's level. If it feels a little too easy, that's fine. If it's so easy it's boring, then go up to the intermediate level.
<P>  Those who are in fairly good shape, have an active lifestyle, or have been exercising on and off for the last year will probably prefer the intermediate level. If you're a very active person in excellent health, you may want to start directly at the advanced level.
<P>  Warning to the impatient and ambitious: There are no extra points in this program for skipping steps and starting out at an unrealistically advanced level. The goal is to stick to the program for the rest of your life. So it doesn't matter where you start; what matters is where you're going.
  
<H2>How to Walk</H2>
<P>  I know you've been doing it since you were a baby. But the first few times you go out for an exercise walk, you may feel like a rank beginner. What do you do with your hands? How do you increase your walking speed without tripping over your own feet? 
<P>  Start your walk at a brisk but comfortable pace to warm up your muscles. After about five minutes, increase your speed and shift from strolling to striding. Doing so involves both increasing the length of each step and increasing the number of steps you take per minute. If you're tall or have long legs, put most of your effort into increasing the length of your stride, covering more distance with each step. Shorter folks with short legs (like me) find it easier to take more steps per minute than to take longer ones. Don't fight your physiology! Instead, work with it and increase your walking speed with the method most comfortable for you. One trick I've discovered is to concentrate on your arms and your breathing, not your legs. If you hold your hands down straight as you walk, the blood will pool in them and they'll feel uncomfortably swollen. So keep your arms bent almost at a right angle. Keep your shoulders down and relaxed (we tend to hunch up when we walk). And hold your head high to make room for your diaphragm to expand. Imagine a crown on your head and you must stretch your neck to hold it up. Squeeze your stomach muscles in and flatten the gut. Breathe in and out to make sure you're not holding your breath.
<P>  Start by strolling easily and letting your arms swing forward from the shoulder blades. Your arms will naturally swing to counterbalance your feet. As your right foot swings forward, your left arm swings with it.
<P>  As you warm up, concentrate on swinging your arms more actively. If you bend your arms at the elbow, you can pump them faster. You'll find that your legs will naturally move faster and more vigorously to keep pace with your arms. You can increase the aerobic benefits of brisk walking by swinging your arms so that your hands reach shoulder level. The use of hand weights will be discussed in my next column. It's important to wait until you've completed the advanced-level program to add weights.
<P>  As you shift from strolling to striding, your stride lengthens and narrows. With each step, the leading leg pulls you forward as your trailing leg pushes off the ground. This alternatively stretches and relaxes the muscles in both the front and back of your legs. This leads to a firmer gait and stronger, more flexible legs.
<P>  Striding also loosens your hips, which become more flexible, and tightens the lower abdominal muscles, making for a stronger, flatter stomach. As you swing your arms, you'll reach farther with your hips. The more you stretch your hips, the more you'll improve your shape.
  
<H2>How Fast?</H2>
Brisk walking feels good. In fact, it's less tiring than strolling or slow walking. The continuous forward momentum of a brisk walk takes some of the weight of gravity off your feet. You get on a roll. 
<P>  A simple way to find out how fast you're walking is to count how many steps you take per minute. Then you can use this simple conversion table to calculate your speed per hour, which is based on an average stride length of 30 inches.

</TABLE>

<P>  Although it's certainly not necessary to count your steps each time you go out for a walk, I recommend you check your pace every few weeks to gauge your improvement. Using a stopwatch, you can measure your pace by counting how many steps you take per minute; 120 steps per minute, for example, is a good, brisk pace.
<P>  Another way to set a good pace as you walk is to sing and/or listen to music tapes. I sing to myself if there are other people around and out loud if I'm alone. Get yourself walking at a good, comfortable, but slightly strenuous pace and then find a favorite song that has the same rhythm.
 
<H2>How Often?</H2>
The ideal way to build a walking habit is to do it every Monday through Friday, especially at the beginning. This will make it a part of your daily routine and give you exposure to various types of weather. And its very regularity will help you remember to do it.
<P>  If you succeed in walking five days during the week, you can then take Saturday and Sunday off without feeling guilty! If, on the other hand, you've skipped a day or two during the week, you can make them up on the weekend.
<P>  In the Walk it Off! program, which aims to build strength and endurance as well as regularity, Week 4 is purposely designed as an "easy" week. You're asked to walk only three days, and for the pace and distance of Week 1. This offers you a kind of reward for sticking to the program, and also lets your body relax after being pushed hard for three weeks.
<P>  The following six-week plan is designed to get you started in a regular walking program. Remember, it takes a minimum of 90 days to firm up a walking habit. After you've completed six weeks at one level, simply repeat the sixth week until you feel ready to increase the challenge. Then begin the six-week plan at the next level. Don't worry if it takes you months of walking to be able to move up; not everyone will be physically able to reach the advanced level.

<H2>After the Walk</H2>
Often the first thing I want to do when I come home after my walk is to drink a glass of water. Thirst is a positive sign of exertion, so greet it as a signal that you've done a good job. Sip the water slowly. If you gulp large amounts, your stomach will feel bloated and uncomfortable.
<P>  It's a good idea to do the three-minute stretch again after your walk, especially if you notice any soreness or tiredness in your muscles. Stretch slowly, paying attention to how tingly your skin feels and how pleasant it is to be physically tired. It's a good idea to create a Walker's Log to record the date, time, and length of your walk.
<P>  If you've perspired a lot, you'll probably want to head for the shower next. Don't rush through it. See if you can't spare some moments to soak, or smooth on some skin cream. You've just done something wonderful for yourself. You deserve at least a small reward!

<P><I>by Sara Aase</I>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>You've spotted Mark Thatcher's acclaimed Teva amphibious sport sandals on feet all around you, even if you didn't know it. Their black rubber soles and nylon straps patterned after Native American jewelry or snakeskin give them away every time. Everyone's wearing them. They are part of American culture, on and off the water. Actually they've become a kind of world sandal. Little children in remote Third World villages even run around in cheap knockoffs. 
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n3/mark.jpg" WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="150" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Mark Thatcher"> 
<P>The story behind Teva Sport Sandals, Inc., the man who invented them, and how he did it is the story of a river. It's a story of whitewater boatmen standing against raging water and rocky cliffs, and the inevitable imaginative musings that fill the mind while lying awake in a canyon watching the migrating moon illuminate one golden corner after another.
<P>  As a Colorado River whitewater rafting guide during college, Thatcher and his fellow "boatmen" (and women) operated in primitive flip-flops, held on only by a toe-strap and the strength of clenched toes. Anyone who has seen a shaggy-haired river boatman leap across the pontoons of a J-rig wearing flip flops knows what a slip-defying act it is. 
<P>  None of them lasted long--the flip flops, that is, since they often disappeared in the effervescent tongues of big drop rapids. Their passengers had it even worse, suffering from waterlog or trapped pebbles in tennies or boots. A solution was needed. An idea for better footwear, Thatcher said, was "in the air."
<P>  After graduating from Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Thatcher's degree in geology landed him a job at an oil company in Houston--at a time when the Texas oil industry was heading toward a bust. Facing a layoff in 1982, Thatcher, with his river days still fresh in his mind, took his severance check and set out to make and sell river runner sandals--an impossibly simple idea he'd only dreamed about. 
<P>  His first successful model--still dubbed the "Original"--was a beach thong purchased in Flagstaff and modified with some nylon straps and Velcro. "I was inspired by the Velcro watches that came out at that time." A friend helped him sew the straps. He admits he didn't even have a name for his first batch of sandals. Nor did he have any idea what lay ahead.
<P>  At first, he struck out with the sandals stuffed in his car, peddling them to river town stores. They routinely turned him and his weird sandals away. Thatcher learned one of his first business lessons: retailers are resistant to change. The only way to grow was by word of mouth--selling directly to boatmen, he said. In the world of marketing it's called opinion leader marketing. "I'd sell them for half-price, and I told them, 'hey, if you don't like them, cut the back strap off;' and a lot of them did. But it got the ball rolling,"  remembers Thatcher.
<P>  In the beginning, Thatcher never expected to see his sandals anywhere but on the river. But soon tourists emulated the boatmen, asking for Tevas in the river town stores. Thatcher says that by the second or third year, those stores carried his sandals. Meanwhile, Thatcher applied for a patent in 1983, determining in the process that he would need a licensee. He lacked the resources to manufacture his sandals on his own. But after about a year, that manufacturer decided to keep making the sandals and cut Thatcher loose--his worse nightmare. "I had this vision of my sandals making it, but not me," he says. Did he ever think of giving up? "There were lots of occasions I thought I was going to lose everything, whether I gave up or not," he said. "What kept me going is I'm relentless." 
<P>  In 1985, Thatcher found another licensee, a California-based sandal company, to make his sandals according to his specifications. He then successfully sued to retain his original rights to the name Teva (pronounced Teh-va), which means "nature" in Hebrew.
<P>     Despite a bumpy beginning, Thatcher quickly realized he had tapped a market much larger than anticipated. After his first year of sales, he said, he saw Tevas in a place he hadn't expected--the street. "When I first saw people I didn't know wearing them, that got exciting," he said. "And then I saw people who weren't boatmen. And then I saw older and younger people wearing them." 
<P>     Other people were seeing the sense behind Thatcher's ideas about footwear and nature. Certainly, the practicality of shoes that stay firmly on your feet and even lend support both in and out of the water is undeniable. A quick look at a Teva explains its appeal: your feet are mostly bare so perspiration dries faster and they stay comfy. There are no surfaces crowding your toes. The straps are padded and adjustable, the footbed and sole are cushioned and shock-absorbing. And, Thatcher claims, the Tevas with toe pieces provide more athletic control than a traditional "athletic" shoe. 
<P>  But for Thatcher, the philosophy behind Teva sandals goes deeper than pure practicality--it's about redefining your relationship with nature. Thatcher thinks peoples' intuition about nature, health, and their feet is starting to kick in. "Your health and well-being, in an analytical sense, has to do in a magical way with your connection to the earth through your feet," he says. "Consumers perceive footwear very differently than they do clothing; that's a magical connection your clothes don't have. So if people don't like their shoes, there's more of a reaction there than, say, for a shirt they don't like." He adds, "Instead of asking how we got people wearing sandals, I say why would you want to design (footwear) any other way? More and more, people are putting fashion third, and putting health and comfort first."
<P>  Today Teva Sport Sandals, Inc. and the market it spawned are big business. Teva's sales went from $200,000 in 1986 to $56 million last year. The company went public in 1993, and in subsequent years Thatcher has been featured in <CITE>Entrepreneur Magazine</CITE> and in a <CITE>Forbes</CITE> feature on new billionaires. His sandals graced the toes of Meryl Streep in the movie River Wild, and the feet of the U.S. Canoe and Kayak Team in the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics.  
<P>  When sales hit one million, Thatcher says, other companies began to notice--and imitate. Companies such as Nike and Reebok have since made their own way in the athletic sandal market. Thatcher says Teva also has successfully sued some 20 leading shoe companies for patent infringement.   
<P>  Teva itself has expanded from river niche to mainstream chic. Besides the myriad of styles available in its sport/utility sandal line, Teva Sport Sandals now also includes rich leather models for dress or casual wear, children's and infants' sandals. There's even an amphibious shoe, the Wet Climber and river runner clothing. 
<P>  Thatcher wants to keep expanding Teva's footwear possibilities. "We're working to sandalize the world," he says. "I'm working on things that are likely to sell less, but they're for the opinion leaders--to keep the brand going." He'd like to modify athletic shoes with an internal toe-piece sandal for greater control and stability. He's also working on a "snow sandal." As a man interested in the lore of footwear, Thatcher also would like to create a sandal museum. "I'd like to learn what materials and strapping configurations were used [in ancient times]." He says a bit enviously, "Everyone on the planet was a cobbler in ancient times."

<H1>A New Wind in Chicago!</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+2><I>The rule against having fun has been lifted. Suddenly Chicago is one of America's great summer destinations.</I></FONT>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>Okay, I admit it. Chicago has changed, and changed mightily. Since Little Richie Daley became mayor, the nation's second city has used its muscle, its energy, and its clout to be not only the city that works, but the city that plays too.
<P>Let me explain. I grew up in Chicago as a streetwise journalist. For years, I pushed the envelope on having a good time in Chicago. You could always count on plenty of jazz, good restaurants, Grant Park's outdoor concerts, and Lake Michigan's beach. But there were always many fun things you just couldn't do in Chicago that you could do everywhere else. Take outdoor caf&eacute;s--they were actually illegal in Chicago. Bringing beach balls into the water went against lifeguard rules. Going downtown was a life-threatening hassle. Having fun could be an uptight experience. In fact, to liven the night, while driving on lower Wacker Drive below Michigan Avenue I used to race my car up the Chicago Sun Times' narrow and curving down ramp for newspaper delivery trucks, emerging unscathed onto Wabash Avenue in an explosion of bravado. It was my version of chicken. (I still do that when I visit Chicago, despite the posted warning signs.)
<P>After awhile, many Chicagoans learned to travel elsewhere for real pleasure. My wife and I did, and we saw the world. But having seen the world, we tried Chicago again this summer--10 years after moving away. The change is unbelievable.
<P>It seems that the rule against having a good time in Chicago has been lifted. In fact, summer in Chicago is awesome--the place to be. Chicago has become one of America's must-visit destination cities, taking its place alongside New York, San Francisco, and New Orleans. And if you're into walking, Chicago may stand out as this nation's premiere urban walking environment.
<P>First, let's get our ground rules straight. Visitors to Chicago can take any number of focus vacations: the pro sports fan trip, the museum and culture circuit, the gourmet restaurant experience, the ethnic tour, the blues thing, the see-the-sights shtick. Each one of those will yield a very different Chicago, and I love them all. But today we shall talk of the newest Chicago, the Chicago that has just now blossomed. Put on your walking shoes and let's discover Chicago's continuing tradition of architecture, its revitalized Lakefront, and that area east of the Michigan Ave. realm known as Streeterville, Navy Pier, and lots of points along the way.

<H2>Getting Situated</H2>
First locate yourself in the heart of Streeterville. We recommend the new Sheraton on the Chicago River because its rooms offer majestic, unobstructed views of Chicago. A south view yields a beautiful panorama of the Chicago River meeting Lake Michigan, Grant Park, south Lake Shore Drive, Buckingham Fountain, and the Field Museum. The Sheraton integrates perfectly with the Chicago River walk, inside and out. From there, it's a short stroll from everything--from Oak Street Beach on the north to Printer's Row on the south. If the Sheraton is unavailable, try Swissotel, a triangular-shaped edifice which also offers unobstructed views from the south bank of the Chicago River. 
  
<H2>Timing is Everything</H2>
Let's be honest. Chicago is not a hot destination during the winter months when frigid winds whip. But from Memorial Day to Labor Day, Chicago becomes a smokin' place. To celebrate the good weather, the city has inaugurated a series of outdoor festivals, food fairs, and other flamboyant phenomena. The campaign peaks on the July 4th weekend with a series of epic extravaganzas. 
<P>  The Taste of Chicago is known everywhere as the nation's largest foodfest, where 250,000 people per day sample the best of Chicago's culinary prowess, from Polish kielbasa and downhome ribs to nouvelle cuisine preparations of duck and beef, and everything in between. Set in magnificent Grant Park, nestled between the wondrous Lake Michigan shore and downtown's exquisite skyline, Taste of Chicago offers more food and picnicking during several days than any single human can experience--although many claim to. 
<P>On July 3, the Grant Park Symphony performs in its outdoor music shell to hundreds of thousands of people. At the climax of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, a spectacular 20-minute fireworks display explodes overhead. Every year these fireworks become more inventive and impressive. This year, Chicago's pyromeisters actually timed their ignitions to the live music. Super nova, warp accelerations, smiley faces, and hand-drawn stars splashed across the sky as volley after volley celebrated the birth of our nation and the irrepressible determination of this second city to prove itself number one in everything. 

<H2>Navy Pier</H2>
The big celebration occurs on July 3. On the fourth proper, come to Navy Pier, a 10-minute stride from the Sheraton. And get ready to meet the new Chicago. You'll feel the difference before you even get there. On the way, stop at North Pier Terminal, a warehouse turned mall along a narrow lakeside basin called the Ogden Slip. Moored in the slip are several just-for-fun burger barges popular with speed boats diners. That's right. Chicago, the place that kicked kids out of  the water for playing with inflatable rafts, the town that became famous for Lake Shore Drive speed traps, has now become a haven for macho speedboats. They like to park next to floating North Pier Terminal restaurants to cool their engines with a cold one locally brewed. We personally prefer the dockside Tavern on the Pier because while the barges cart their food in and warm it up, Tavern prepares its food fresh in the kitchen.
<P>  After you're totally relaxed you can go upstairs in the Terminal to play laser tag or battle aliens in a state-of-the-art virtual game house. Or buy a used parking meter or stop light at the City of Chicago store. An excellent comfort shoe store, Singer's, carries the latest in walking shoes.
<P>  Approaching Navy Pier, you'll pass a public fountain. We mean just that. It's okay to climb into this fountain to relieve the heat.  Its unpredictable jets will either sprinkle or drench you, depending on your daring. Gee, kids used to be arrested for dipping into plaza fountains.
<P>  Navy Pier is divided into three linear lines. The north face is mainly service and convention stuff, and as yet undeveloped. But the center halls and aisles are filled with restaurants, kiosks, shops, and attractions. The south face is packed with boat rides, music, attractions, and food stands. 
<P>  Three of the best sit-down center aisle eateries are Widow Newton, Charlie's Ale House, and Riva. Then be blown away by a towering 3-D IMAX movie screen, a crystal palace encasing a tropical garden, a giant stories-high outdoor Ferris wheel, an artisan-crafted carousel, and much more. The south face is lined with half-hour and longer tablecloth dinner cruises, water shuttles, and our splash favorite, The Sea Dog, a new breed of passenger speed boat. If you do nothing else on the Pier, take the Sea Dog, with its arfing pilots and blasting surf music. The Sea Dog dashes along the harbors and shorelines at 50 knots. Expect to get seriously drenched if you sit along the outside. Further down on the south face, relax in the Beer Garden and maybe you'll catch a wedding reception.
<P>  On summer weekends, at 10:30 p.m., sit in awe as the Pier explodes thrilling laser and fireworks not far away in the lake, but up close and personal, just overhead. Sitting anywhere on the steps or standing along the walkways, stare skyward and you can almost touch the pyrotechnic palm trees, star bursts, and other fire paint dazzling across the heavens. Damn it, where was this Navy Pier 20 years ago?
<P>  Navy Pier is a place to be, a place to hang and wonder, a place to admire the skyline and walk in peace along pierside sculptures, and past home grown music groups; where you can buy some corn or a necklace, all while sipping fresh lemonade or a local microbrew even as you feel lake breezes before they dance with the flags and banners above. Here you can fall in love, or perhaps discover it hidden within.

<H2>Architectural Heaven</H2>
I'll say it and fight the objectors. Chicago possesses the best architecture in the nation, and Chicago is the best city for viewing its architecture. It's more than just pretty buildings. Chicago's architectural splendor is organically tied to its history and development. After the Chicago Fire in 1871, most wooden structures downtown and in the near north burned. Architects from across America and Europe saw the chance to rebuild using scorched Chicago as a lab for architectural style and experimentation. The movement known as the Chicago School of Architecture flowered. The greatest urban growth in history and the need for fireproof materials set the stage for the first skyscrapers, one of which, the Monadnock Building, still stands. 
<P>"Form follows function" became the battle cry as neoclassic decorativeness was replaced with glass and steel boxes under the leadership of worshipped architect guru Mies van der Rohe. Walk outside the Sheraton or look through its windows. You'll see the auburn and bronze Time-Life Building, the dark geometry of the IBM Building and nearby Lake Shore Drive apartment towers, the monumental ectoskeletal Hancock Center, the rust Civic Center, a complex of Federal Buildings, the sloping State of Illinois Building, the green curving splendor of the 333 Wacker Building, and even the tawdry red CNA Financial Center. Many of them were Mies-designed; others were designed by his followers. All of them in their own way whisper and sometimes giggle the Miesian mantra: "less is more."
<P>  There was room for intelligent dissent as Harry Weese and others sought brave new self-contained mini-metropolises in self-containing geometrics, such as the circular pedals of Marina City and River City. A new wave of architects insisted on Art Deco whimsy typified by the NBC Building. And the cityscape even tolerates that cacophony of unnecessary height, the Sears Tower. All of it stands out against the old aristocracy of the Tribune Tower, Wrigley Building, City Hall, and the Field Museum, creating the contrasts of a great city.
<P>  Because the Chicago River and inviolable Grant Park create natural spaces, and because zoning historically has required set-back from the sidewalk, the magnificent structures of Chicago are eminently viewable, not as domineering and tightly-packed Manhattanesque heights of office space, but as art pieces carefully dropped into a garden setting. A relaxing way to learn about Chicago's architectural heritage is to take the two-hour architectural cruise down the Chicago River. Board at North Pier Terminal. 
<P>  A better way is to amble through the architecture, through its sunken and surrounding plazas, connecting thoroughfares and walk routes. One of our favorite meandering routes starts at Pioneer Court on Michigan Avenue at the Chicago River; stroll through a decorous urban gazebo to an elevated circle betwixt the University of Chicago's Blecher Center and the NBC Tower. Descend the steps to the Chicago River walk, designed by the grandson of Mies van der Rohe, then walk past the Sheraton's stretch of the River to Centennial Fountain, probably Chicago's least visited and under-appreciated public art. Created to commemorate the city's massive water reclamation projects, the fountain effervescently cascades water to a pool surrounded by stairstep seating that abuts a great water canon. For 10 minutes per hour the canon shoots a monstrous water arch across nearly the entire channel of the Chicago River. 
<P>  From Centennial, walk up to Fairbanks Street to the bronzed Time-Life Building, and from there back across the Chicago River to the mega white towering Amoco Oil Building and its surrounding plazas. At the east gateway you have a commanding view of Grant Park. Walk through its gardens, sculpture displays, and statuary to the Art Institute. If you stop, be prepared to spend a few hours hyperdazzled by famous Rembrandts, Cezannes, Lautrecs, Dalis, El Grecos, and Picassos. 
<P>  Try Chicago once and you may decide to make it an annual summer pilgrimage. The walker's mecca, Streeterville, the Chicago River, and the new Chicago spirit are just one blessing of this hajj. In succeeding trips, discover and rediscover the other joys and dreams of America's great, sprawling, towering urban accomplishment. 
<P>Damn! What took them so long?

</CENTER>

<H3>Hotels</H3>
<B>Sheraton Chicago</B>
<BR>301 East North Water Street
<BR><B>(312) 464-1000</B>
<P>Your best bet for a Streeterville walking adventure is the Sheraton Chicago, which sits astride the Chicago River. Insist on a south view, as far east, and on as high a floor as possible. Room window views are spectacular.

<P><B>Swissotel Chicago</B>
<BR>323 E. Wacker Drive
<BR><B>(312) 565-0565</B>
<P>A new triangular-shaped hotel on the Chicago River's south bank. Ask for a southeast view overlooking Grant Park or a northeast view overlooking Navy Pier.
<HR>
<H3>Restaurants</H3>
<I>Chicago offers scores of wonderful restaurants exemplifying every style from ethnic to gourmet. We have dozens of favorites. Here are a few must-visit recommendations.</I>

<P><B>Hat Dance</B>
<BR>325 W. Huron Street
<BR><B>(312) 649-0961</B>
<P>If you can choose only one restaurant, choose Hat Dance with its unique interpretation of Mexican cuisine and trendy surroundings. Try to bring a group so everyone can order up a storm and share. Our favorites include mushroom flautas, cilantro-lime chicken, and grilled tiger prawns. Casual dress, moderate price.

<P><B>Signature Room at the 95th</B>
<BR>John Hancock Center
<BR><B>(312) 787-9596</B>
<P>Very reluctantly we recommend this latest incarnation of the once elegant 95th Restaurant, atop the John Hancock Center--but only if you can secure a south view, and a reservation about an hour before sunset. You will experience the single most magnificent view of Chicago's lakefront and architecture, both during daylight and at night. If you ignore the food and service, you'll have a great time. Also available for lunch at a significant discount. Casual to dressy, very expensive.

<P><B>Petros Dianna's</B>
<BR>1633 N. Halstead Street
<BR><B>(312)-642-8484</B>
<P>A wonderful and joyous Greek restaurant frequented by Chicago insiders and Greek aficionadoes alike. Affable host Petros loves to pour on the schmaltz--or in this case, the flaming saganaki. Expect to eat to excess. Casual to dressy, moderately priced.

<P><B>The Old Carolina Crab House</B>
<BR>North Pier Terminal
<BR><B>(312) 321-8400</B> 
<P>A campy seafood and burger place with exquisite views of the Chicago River and architecture along its north bank. Casual, moderately priced.
<HR>
<H3>Cruises</H3>
<B>Seadog</B>
<BR>Navy Pier
<BR><B>(312) 822-7200</B>
<P>The group speedboat with a splashy attitude. Dress for drenching. Price is $8.

<P><B>Chicago From the Lake</B>
<BR>North Pier Terminal
<BR><B>(312) 527-2002</B>
<P>The two-hour "architectural cruise" departs several times daily from North Pier Terminal. It's wonderful. Price is $18.

<H1>Waves and Streams of Comfort</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin and Elizabeth Black</I>
</CENTER>
  
<P>Water courses through this issue as a recurring direct and indirect theme as we explore the realms of lower extremity comfort and fun. Our main story tells the recent history of <A HREF="/stride/v1n3/euro.html">EuroComfort</A>, which first crossed the Atlantic in the suitcases and backpacks of Baby Boomers who discovered the shoes while walking across Europe. Today, EuroComfort is a trendy buzzword everyone is trying to latch onto. But just what is EuroComfort, and why should it be part of your lifestyle? Our main story details how EuroComfort can help your feet--and then hints who in America is trying to catch up.
<P>Then, don your water sandals and meet Mark Thatcher</A>, the Colorado River boatman turned shoe inventor who wants to <A HREF="/stride/v1n3/teva.html">sandalize the world</A>--one river at a time. Thatcher's story is one of perseverance and innovation, and not a small amount of litigation, as he sought to bring river running footwear to the world at large. 
<P>Now switch rivers, from the Colorado to the Chicago. Come with us as we rediscover the <A HREF="/stride/v1n3/chicago.html">City of Chicago</A>, its magnificent lakefront, revitalized Chicago River, and America's newest pleasure zone, Navy Pier. Indeed, Chicago has become a summer mecca for walkers, river cruisers, and lake lovers. It's an exciting package of fireworks, concerts, food fests, and sweeping architecture up close and personal. 
<P>Then get serious about muscle and bone in three articles. First, is your workplace an accident waiting to happen? Do you recognize the hidden hazards and unnoticed injuries that can take a mighty toll on your back, legs, and feet? Are you carrying big loads on high heels or walking executive mile after mile? Read <A HREF="/stride/v1n3/beat.html"<CITE>On the Beat</CITE></A> and see where you stand--literally.
<P>Second, discover why staying away from dairy products is bad to the bone--your bone. Calcium is still necessary to avoid osteoporosis. Yet most Americans have dramatically reduced their intake, in large part because of avoidance of dairy products. <A HREF="/stride/v1n3/calcium.html"><CITE>Boning Up on Calcium</CITE></A> shows you just how much calcium you need and how to get it. 
<P>Third, consider your tough but vulnerable Achilles tendon. If you have ever felt that whack on the back of the leg, and then hobbled in pain for weeks, you know how important it is to avoid Achilles tendon injuries. Turn to <A HREF="/stride/v1n3/doctor.html"><CITE>The Doctor's In</CITE></A>, as Mark Myerson, MD, noted orthopedic surgeon and specialist on the Achilles tendon, answers your questions on how to recognize and avoid Achilles tendon injuries. 
<P>Now a follow-up to last issue's Editors' Memo, in which we challenged America to reform the reformers and do something to stop the downward spiral of managed care. We have an idea that might work if enough people get behind it. Complaining to your doctor is useless; he has no power. Complaining to your managed care organization is useless; they couldn't care less--they're in the complaint business. Complaining to your Congressmen is useless; how many of them are in some lobbyist's hip pocket?
<P>But someone is starting to listen: your employer or union. Employers and unions are among the largest private sector factors driving managed care. They are nodding yes to ruthless dollar cuts. Now, the pendulum is just barely beginning to swing the other way. So much quality has been taken out of managed care, Americans everywhere are openly unhappy. Since health benefits can make or break an employee relationship, many employers and unions are beginning to demand more from managed care. Companies are tiring of dissatisfied employees. Market conscious managed care organizations are responding with better packages and more coverage to retain their competitive edge. You can encourage the trend by expressing yourself. Forget the White House. Tell your boss. 
<P>Now a few words about the rapid growth of <CITE>Stride Magazine</CITE>. With this issue, we have added some 10,000 additional doctors' offices and scores of additional shoe stores, and health and fashion centers. Our readers are telling us that <CITE>Stride</CITE> is making a difference. We'd love to hear your <A HREF="mailto:strideletters@ifi-rock.com">comments</A>.

<H1>Running Start</H1>
</CENTER>

<H2>Health superstores</H2>
Health conscious America was ready for it. Entrepreneurial America sensed it. And medical America is slowly accepting the idea of high quality retail health. Enter the American health superstore. Soon, names such as MedMax and the American Health Superstore will begin to sprout up in malls and shopping centers as often as the Sports Authority and Home Depot. 
<P>  Far more than an overgrown drug store or a fancified medical supply shop, health superstores will tap into the latest in medical products, including many previously available only through a doctor's prescription. For example, Aircast ankle stirrup braces, Johnson &#38; Johnson neoprene knee supports, and medical grade prefabricated foot orthotics, all previously dispensed only through a physician will be available. Doctors would be able to prescribe or recommend such products for dispensing just as they would any drug. If these operations do not bypass traditional doctor involvement, but rather relieve providers of their warehousing and inventory duties, the country's health-care system may benefit.
<P>  The American Health Superstore in Rockville, MD--opened by an orthopedic surgeon--is around the corner from the FDA and offers a range of health services. The store is divided into subsections. A resource center offers health and medical books, publications, and tapes. Other sections are devoted to women's health, wheelchairs and scooters, assisted living, bathroom safety, nutrition, home safety, personal care, diabetes, the back, personal training, first aid, and lower extremity health. That's a lot, covering more than 20,000 products.
<P>  If such stores work, expect to see an explosion of them next year. MedMax, now open in Westland, Michigan, plans eight more in the next 14 months. The quality of such stores must be constantly reviewed and self-medication and sham therapies must be avoided. If marketeers convert health superstores into medical K-Marts where anything goes, no one will be served. If they make health and health devices more accessible and affordable, they will change one face of American healthcare for the better.

<H2>  Osteoporosis on the road</H2>
An initiative to combat osteoporosis has hit the road. Osteoporosis is the crippling and often life-threatening bone disease that affects some 25 million Americans, mostly older women. But it can be treated if detected early. 
<P>  Some 1.5 million fractures attributable to osteoporosis occur each year in America. Yet there are only 1,000 bone densitometry machines in the nation. So the BoneMatters Tour has crammed state-of-the-art bone density testing equipment into a 35-ft.-long Winnebago which travels from place to place offering free screening. Academy Award winner Olympia Dukakis helped launch the program admitting: "I watched my mother shrink. I watched her stoop over. I don't think that is going to happen to me. I discovered early that I had osteoporosis."
<P>  Sandoz Pharmaceuticals and Lunar are backing the project. Sandoz makes Miacalcin nasal spray and Lunar makes high-tech x-ray equipment used in bone testing. The BoneMatters Tour hits Chicago, Madison, Seattle, and other cities in September, and then winds its way throughout California. Information about osteoporosis, undoubtedly encased in promotional material for Sandoz, as well as screening tour route stops can be had by calling <B>800-606-BONE</B>.

<H2>  Gas chamber for addicts</H2>
An inventor is marketing what could be called a gas chamber for addicted smokers. The windowless booth, about the size of an airline restroom, is designed for smoke-free environments, especially offices and restaurants. Nicotine-addicted employees who customarily hang out in parking lots and garages to inhale could instead dash into the booth to quickly grab a fix. The nondescript booth is devoid of comfort, offering merely a hard phone booth-style seat. The booth is  not designed to be a pleasant break, but a genuine "fix chamber" that would quickly return an employee to work. As such, the booth is actually being touted to employers as a "productivity boost." No one has yet mentioned the liability any employer would face for consciously catering to, or worsening, the medical damage of an acknowledged addiction.

<H2>  Get Kooped up</H2>
Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, MD, is leading a crusade to shape up adult physiques by asking parents to be more active with their children. A recent survey shows parents of all socioeconomic brackets cite childcare responsibilities as a major obstacle to getting more physical activity. So Dr. Koop has helped launch Shape Up America! It sounds prosaic: "the family that exercises together stays together." But the program is actually less goody two-shoes than that. Dr. Koop proposes that normal chores such as walking the pet or shopping can be a joint endeavor with the kids. 
<P>It starts with turning off the TV and making outings a little more exciting. Are you going on a "dumb old walk" or are you going to explore a new park or street? Buy toys that promote physical activity rather than sedentary pursuits such as video games. Play active backyard games with your children. They love it. And you both get your physical exercise. Get involved at your children's school. Let your local school board know that physical education should be a priority.
<P>  The National Association of Sport and Physical Education is leading a network of some 40 athletic groups supporting Dr. Koop's initiative. A free brochure, 99 Tips for Family Fitness, is available from MET/Rx Foundation for Health Enhancement, 2112 Business Center Drive, Irvine CA 92715.

<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n3/hanger.jpg" WIDTH="62" HEIGHT="350" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="closet shoe hanger">
<H2>Hang up your shoes</H2> 
Late summer is a great time to clean out your closet in anticipation of organizing your fall duds. That include shoes. First idea: stop closet floor shoe clutter with a hanging shoe bag that holds 10 pairs but takes only five inches of closet space--about the equivalent of two hanging dresses. Plus the hanging bag makes it easy to find the pair you want in a hurry. Available at The Container Store and other locations for under $20. 

<H2>...Or toss them over the door</H2>
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n3/door2.jpg" WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="207" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="shoe hanger--back of door">
Over-the-door shoe racks have always been popular. This shoe rack from Lynx, a company that also makes a variety of stackable shoe storage units, holds up to 24 pairs, but also holds shoe boxes for those who like to keep seldom-worn shoes inside their boxes. Under $20 from Bed, Bath &#38; Beyond, The Container Store, and Linens &#38; Things.

<H2>...But don't use shoes for doorstops</H2>
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n3/entry.jpg" WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="142" ALIGN="LEFT"ALT="combo entry-way storage chest/shoe rack">
Does your family kick off their shoes the moment they walk in the door, creating 
a sea of dirty sneakers to trip over in the entranceway? Don't fight it, control it. 
A shoe storage chest with drawers that swing out holds up to 30 pairs of shoes in an accordian-styled shelving system. Plus, it doubles as a handy 
piece of entry hall furniture. You can decorate the chest and turn it into a conversation piece. Available at Bloomingdale stores or by mail order. Call <B>1-800-555-SHOP</B>. Now all you have to worry about is the clutter that will inevitably accumulate on top of the chest!

<P>
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n3/fmat.jpg" WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="148" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="footprint-shaped surface mats">
<H2>Footprint cushion mat</H2>
The surfaces on which you stand can be important to your safety and 
comfort. (See <A HREF="/stride/v1n3/beat.html">On the Beat</A>.) The "Anywhere" comfort mat, made in Germany, gives your feet some extra cushioning on spots where you frequently stand, or it can be used to prevent slipping in high traffic wet places. The funky footprint shape announces its purpose, and is available in several sizes and colors. Perfect for beside the sink, beside or inside the shower stall, poolside, or on decks. The mat is available at Bed Bath &#38; Beyond and other housewares retailers. For more industrial-style, heavy-duty cushioning mats, check your local Office Depot, Staples, or other office supply retailer.

<H2>Don't go sockless, but if you must...</H2>
You know you're not supposed to, but we all do it, especially in summer. But ordinary shoe insoles and linings aren't designed for bare feet. Your feet put out a pint of sweat a day, and that can add up to sticky, clammy, smelly shoes and feet. SockLess Insoles from Pedifix make wearing shoes without socks comfortable and more hygienic. The insoles are made from soft terrycloth with thick foam bottoms to add cushioning. Baking soda embedded in the insoles fights odor. What's more, you can throw SockLess Insoles into the washing machine. If you like to go sockless, buy several pair--they're inexpensive enough to be treated as disposables. The insoles come in men's and women's sizes and can be trimmed to fit. Available at drugstores everywhere, or call <B>1-800-PEDIFIX</B> for information or to order.

<H2>Stay cool</H2>
The average temperature inside your shoes is 110 degrees! So blast your tired, hot, sweaty feet with Foot Cooler, a refreshing spray from Pedifix. The spray deodorizes and dries on contact. Best sprayed on barefeet, but also works through socks and hosiery. Available at drugstores everywhere, or call <B>1-800-PEDIFIX</B>.

<H2>Wear your shoes on your chest</H2>
Footwear Industries of America has tapped the talent of distinguished watercolor artist Marian Steen to create t-shirt designs sure to delight shoe lovers. Your choice of four designs is silk screened on the shirts, and they are available in a variety of sizes. These are custom order and carry a substantial price break for more than 12. For ordering information, call <B>202-789-1420</B>.

<H1>Custom Orthotics: Do You Need Them?</H1>

<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Sarah is a nurse in a Chicago hospital. In a typical day, she walks the equivalent of seven miles per day. Although she wears roomy white nurses' shoes, she still soaks her swollen feet at night. They hurt and lately her knees have been aching as well. She saw the staff podiatrist, who, after an examination, encased her feet in plaster to create a slipper-like mold. That mold was then sent to an orthotic lab where the contours were analyzed and adjustments to the foot outline were added. The corrected cast was then used to create a shoe insert made of a shock absorbing material. Sarah replaced the original beaten down insole in her shoe with the new insert. She noticed the difference immediately. Within a week, the pain in her knees was gone, and soon she stopped soaking her feet altogether. 
<P>  Roger is a Cleveland attorney. When he walked, his feet rolled in and they pronated. By the time he turned 35, pain in his ankles, knees, and lower back was a fact of daily life. His HMO sent him to an orthopedic surgeon who placed his feet in a foam box, which recorded an impression of Roger's feet. The foam box was sent to a lab which used the impression to create a hard plastic shoe insert that would control his foot motion. Within a month, Roger's pain receded.
<P>  Sarah and Roger spent hundreds of dollars for these inserts. They're called custom orthotics. But they could have walked into any drugstore and purchased a Spenco or Pedifix insole for a fraction of the cost. 
<P>  What are custom orthotics, when are they needed, and are they worth it? Much has been written about custom orthotics--mostly by people who don't know much about them or have an ax to grind either for or against the treatment. The facts cannot be neatly shrink-wrapped and dispensed. The truth about custom orthotics is different for every person and for every application. In other words, custom orthotics are real honest to gosh medical treatment that should not be taken lightly. Nor are they the solution for every pair of feet.
<P>  Start by understanding that the term custom orthotic is medical slang for custom foot orthosis. In <CITE>Stride</CITE>, we use the term orthotic because it is common parlance both by practitioners and the public. In our doctor-only magazine, <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>, we use the correct term custom foot orthosis. Orthosis means brace, or a body support. The same term, orthosis, is used to identify the massive body supporting braces cerebral palsy patients wear and those little inserts in your shoe. The point is, a custom foot orthosis is real medical therapy. It doesn't come cheap, and it's only called for when a doctor or other health care practitioner prescribes it.
<P>  So while insoles are everyday self-management, when you have a real problem, you may need a real foot orthotic. It's really not that different from buying drug store cold medicine for flu-like symptoms compared to seeing a doctor to be treated with antibiotics. 
<P>  When is a custom device called for? Sometimes a practitioner may actually recommend an inexpensive drugstore insole because the problem is indeed temporary or minor, and the functional control of a real orthotic is not necessary. More frequently, a practitioner may treat a serious foot, leg, or back problem with a prefabricated orthotic. A prefab is an inexpensive orthotic that comes premolded for average foot sizes and conditions. Most doctors may modify or customize that prefabricated device for specific foot and leg problems. That works much of the time, and is often the most cost-effective treatment for a specific person's problem and economic situation.
<P>  Yet there are many instances when wearing an orthotic designed for everyone else is not good enough for your particular foot and ailment. Your doctor may determine you can best be served by a custom device molded exactly to your foot, and modified for your exact bodyweight and stature to address your specific medical problem. If so, he'll order a custom orthotic. 
<P>  Not every patient who walks in the doctor's door is a candidate for a custom. Prefabs can do the trick for many. By the same token, in some cases, prefabs can provide only a short-term remedy and are the wrong treatment for some people.
<P>  Which do you need? Self-diagnosis is silly, so in large measure you must depend on the skill and approach of your practitioner for treatment that is either as simple as an insole or prefab, or as complicated as a custom. In today's managed care world, that medical judgment unfortunately will also be influenced by insurance company and HMO rules. But in the final analysis, the value of one's health is a deeply personal economic decision. You will decide how much you pay for an orthotic and whether you pay for it yourself, just as many people do now for dental and eye care.
<P>  A range of doctors and practitioners within the biomechanics mainstream can treat you with custom orthotics. Exactly how will be determined by their scope of practice and or clinical emphasis. A sports practitioner, whether orthopedist, podiatrist, physical therapist, or chiropractor, may focus on problems relating to running, such as ankle or knee pain. He may prescribe a shock absorbing device. A provider focused on diabetic care, whether orthopedist, podiatrist, or pedorthist, will want to prescribe a soft cushioning and protective orthotic, perhaps in conjunction with a special shoe. The treatment list is extensive and includes: heel pain, bunions, metatarsalgia, shin splints, knee pain, low back pain, osteoarthritis of the hip and spine, tendinitis of the knee and hip, and a gamut of diabetic problems. Literally, every condition affected by the way your foot meets the ground can be addressed by orthotic therapy. 
<P>  Ironically, not every doctor is experienced in foot orthotics. Various foot and leg specialists, diabetologists, sports medicine practitioners, and those who treat the elderly know orthotics well. But many family practice doctors, practitioners specializing in the upper extremity, and others may not know their value. Hence, an obstetrician might tell a pregnant woman to endure her knee and back pain. But an orthopedist might quickly recommend a shock absorbing orthotic.
<P>  Doctors divide orthotics into two sometimes arbitrary categories: functional and accommodative. Functional devices are hard, take some getting used to, and are designed to control or modify the way your foot meets the ground, thereby affecting the entire kinetic chain from your heel to your back. To accomplish that, stiffness is required. Accommodative devices are softer and more resilient, designed to protect or cushion your foot in its existing position. Naturally, there are many flavors in between, such as semirigid and semi-accommodative, depending upon the parlance of your practitioner. All of these devices generally include custom features that only a skilled practitioner can add, such as elevated wedges, cut-outs, or special pads.
<P>  The materials used to fabricate orthotics are key. It is a common misconception among doctors that rigid devices require hard plastic materials and accommodatives require soft cushy ones. That is true only to a point. In reality, the thickness of the orthotic and the weight of the patient determines whether a device is rigid and controlling, or flexible and accommodative. Ultrathin hard plastic topped by a cushy cover for a 250 lb. man will bend and accommodate. Very dense foam can control the pronation of a 110 lb. woman. Moreover, many devices are fabricated of multiple layers of materials.
<P>  It's also important to know what constitutes a custom orthotic because technology and marketing have blurred the lines. But as it stands today, a custom orthotic requires a licensed practitioner to take a three-dimensional impression of your foot and have the final device corrected and fitted. That impression can be captured with varying degrees of accuracy by plaster cast, a foam box, sand pillows, and now even high-tech laser scanners, such as the ScanCast 3D and contact digitizers, such as the Amfit Footfax. Often the effectiveness of the orthotic depends upon the decision to cast you in a sitting, standing, or reclining position. A poorly cast orthotic may not help at all. There's considerable medical expertise involved every step along the way, and the cost reflects it.
<P>  Do not confuse custom with customizable, which are prefabricated devices customized to your foot. They are much less expensive and are often the therapy you need. But they are not the same--just as a custom suit and an altered off-the-shelf suit are not the same.
<P>  Anyone who knows anything about orthotics knows that whole books can be written about just the basics. We've only scratched the surface in this column. But that surface is the one you're standing on.

<H2>What is the Achilles tendon?</H2>
The two leading leg muscles attach to the ankle in a unit called the Achilles Tendon, named after the mythological warrior, Achilles. His most vulnerable spot was at his heel. And well named it is, since it is an area of the body frequently injured by athletes and indeed potentially anyone who is active.

<H2>Why is my Achilles tendon an 
important structure?</H2>
The Achilles is essential for all walking and indeed all lower body motion. It provides you with push-off strength for springing, jumping, running, and stability for such actions as squatting or standing on tiptoe. Without a viable and working Achilles, you quite simply lack the ability to translate energy into cohesive leg motion.

<H2>What causes problems with the 
Achilles tendon?</H2>
Your Achilles tendon needs to stay strong. But any number of routine as well as athletic factors can undermine it. Among the most common problems are overuse, poor training techniques, and pronation--that is, the rolling in of the foot during regular walking. A common problem is simply failing to stretch and warm up adequately, especially among the newly or suddenly active, or really anyone beyond--shall we say--their 30s. In the elderly, the Achilles inevitably undergoes inflammation and deterioration.

<H2>How do I know if I have a problem 
with my Achilles tendon?</H2>
If your Achilles' normal strength and elasticity is disrupted, you'll feel it. Your problem might be as simple as a temporary episode of inflammation. But that may lead to chronic tendinitis. In serious cases, you could experience a partial or full tear or rupture of the tendon. If you do have rupture, you'll feel a telltale whack in the back of the leg, as though someone hit you with a baseball bat. And you won't be able to walk without weakness or pain.

<H2>What kinds of treatment are available?</H2>
If walking is painful following acute injury, get to a doctor or emergency room immediately. Nonsurgical methods are the first line of treatment unless the tendon is completely torn. Some cases will require a cast or other form of immobilization. Other cases may require a simple and inexpensive quarter-inch heel lift in the shoe. Orthotic supports can help. And of course, physical therapy to restore strength is essential. 


<H2>Can surgery be performed to 
alleviate chronic pain?</H2>
Surgery is available when other methods of treating chronic tendinitis have been exhausted. In my practice, I encourage walking immediately following surgery, and usually I do not use a postsurgical cast. The idea is to return quickly to activity and strength, which is not possible if a cast is used. 

<H2>How can I prevent problems with my Achilles tendon in the future?</H2>
Analyze what activity caused your Achilles problem and modify this accordingly or your healing will be only temporary. That may mean a strict regimen of regular stretching and strengthening. Warming up before athletic activity is a must and correct training techniques are essential. You may require an arch support or orthotic. Most of all you will need to understand--as did the mythological warrior--that your Achilles tendon is not invulnerable.

<H1>Obesity</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Do weight gains lead to lower extremity pains?</B></FONT>
<P><I>by Carol Frey, MD, Carrie Chan, and Nelly Carrasco, MD</I>
</CENTER>
<P>Nine months had passed since 37-year-old Gerty Henderson last donned her pink apron and took orders from the lunch crowd at Joe's Diner. But now, having recuperated from the low back pain that kept her sidelined, she was back on her waitressing beat. A mere two weeks after returning to work, however, she was sidelined again. This time, her feet were hurting. Her doctor traced the foot pain back to the 27 lbs. she had gained during her sedentary nine-month recuperation period.
<P>It is difficult to say how many other Americans at any given time are out of commission due to lower extremity problems related to weight gain. For while the effects of being overweight have been well documented in terms of cardiovascular risk, kidney function, endocrine function, arthritis, and longevity, little attention has focused on obesity and the lower extremities.
<P>Still, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that the additional mechanical stress of carrying excess weight takes its toll. Most practitioners have treated their share of lower extremity problems that they suspect are complicated by, if not caused by, weight problems. The medical literature is dotted with references to foot problems in overweight patients, such as plantar fasciitis, arthritis, and bursitis, not to mention biomechanical problems such as gait changes. And what practitioner hasn't heard his or her overweight patients complain about difficulty finding shoes that fit properly?
<P>Obesity is a growing problem in this country. Already, some 32 million women and 26 million men--roughly one-third of the U.S. population--are considered overweight, weighing at least 20 percent more than desirable levels. And, according to recent government surveys, during the past 15 years the mean body weight of U.S. adults has increased by 7.9 lbs (3.6 kg). As Americans' waistlines continue to expand, related lower extremity problems can be expected to increase as well.
<P>Just what impact does obesity have on the lower extremities? To begin to address the problem, we undertook a two-part study that focused on how obesity affects foot size and pathology in women. In Part I of the study, we surveyed 580 female patients of an orthopedic foot and ankle practice to determine the percentage of "obese" patients presenting with foot complaints as compared to a group of "non-obese" patients in the same practice. In Part II of the study, 88 female patients were followed for five years to determine weight changes and the resultant changes in foot and shoe size.

<H2>Foot Problems Related to Weight Problems</H2>

At their initial visit, the height and weight of the 580 study participants was compared with the 1983 Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's Height and Weight Tables. Each patient was placed in one of several classifications: normal weight, between 10-19 percent over ideal body weight, 20-30 percent over ideal body weight, and 30 percent or more above ideal body weight. "Overweight" was defined as 20 percent or more above desirable levels as outlined in the Metropolitan Life Insurance Tables; "obese" was defined as 30 percent above the weights shown in the tables. All patients were evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon, who noted any foot deformities.
<P>Among the 580 women surveyed, the proportion of overweight and obese women mirrored that reported in government surveys: 13 percent were considered overweight and 25 percent were considered obese. 
<P>Compared to patients in the normal weight range, the overweight and obese group reflected a higher incidence of plantar fasciitis, tendinitis, fractures, and sprains. When the data were evaluated by diagnosis, of the 65 patients diagnosed with plantar fasciitis, 65 percent were overweight or obese. Fifty-five percent of the patients with tendinitis and osteoarthritis were overweight. Interestingly, only 19 percent of the patients with hallux valgus, 20 percent of the patients with nerve entrapment, and 24 percent of the patients with hammertoes were overweight or obese.
<P>

<TD>Osteoarthritis <TD>6 <TD>3
</TABLE>


<P>These data show that weight problems are associated with a higher incidence of certain foot problems, notably overuse problems such as plantar fasciitis, tendinitis, fractures, and sprains. Clearly, the added stress of excess weight does take a toll on the feet. A related question is: How does weight gain affect foot size and shoe size?

<H2>Expanding Waistline Tied to Expanding Shoe Size</H2>
To answer the question about foot size, we evaluated 88 women between the ages of 20 and 60, with a mean age of 51. This part of the study was restricted to women with no history of diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, previous foot trauma, or foot surgery. The patients' body weights and weightbearing foot tracings were obtained in 1990 and again in 1995. For the foot tracing, forefoot width was measured as the widest line that could be drawn perpendicular to a line drawn from the center of the second toe to the center of the heel, across the ball of the foot. Heel width was measured as the widest line that could be drawn perpendicular to the second toe-to-heel-line, across the heel. The following information was also collected: shoe size in 1990 and in 1995, pregnancy between 1990 and 1995, shoe comfort, shoe preference, and when the patients last had their feet measured.
<P>At the start of the study, 55 percent of the women weighed more than the desirable body weight as defined in the 1983 Metropolitan Height and Weight Tables. Fifteen percent of the women were between 20-30 percent overweight, and 15 percent were more than 30 percent overweight. The average shoe size was slightly larger than 7 1/2. 
<P>During the course of the study, 70 percent of the women experienced a weight gain--9 lbs. on average--and the average shoe size of the group as a whole increased by almost a full size. Moreover, 64 percent of the women who gained weight experienced an increase in shoe size, compared to only 31 percent of the subjects who remained the same weight, and 28 percent of the subjects who had lost weight. For women with more than a 20-lb. weight gain, 93 percent reported an increase in shoe size. And more than half of the women who became pregnant during the course of the test period experienced an increase in shoe size, although few had a significant permanent weight gain (an average of 4 lbs.). 

<P>
<B>TABLE 2
<BR>Average Foot Size of Patients, 1990 and 1995</B>

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TD COLSPAN=2><TH ALIGN="RIGHT>1990 <TH ALIGN="RIGHT">1995
<TR>
<TD COLSPAN=2><B>Overall Forefoot Width</B> <TD>8.81cm <TD>9.06cm
<TR>
<TD COLSPAN=2><B>Overall Heel Width</B> <TD>5.85cm <TD>5.88cm
</TABLE> 


<P>Our data reveal that weight gains among women often are accompanied by increases in foot size. Moreover, women who gained weight not only had an increase in foot length, but also in foot width.
<P>Interestingly, while women who reported a weight gain generally purchased a longer shoe, it was rare for women in the study to report purchasing a wider shoe. This may be explained in part because of the lack of availability of width sizing in most shoes. If a person who gains weight cannot accommodate her increased foot size with a longer shoe, she will have a difficult time with shoe fit and she will suffer the consequences of ill-fitting shoes, such as calluses, corns, bunions, hammertoes, ingrown toenails, and neuromas.
<P>In fact, most of the women in this study (69 percent) did report having a difficult time finding fashion shoes that fit their feet. Thirty-one percent reported having trouble finding athletic shoes that fit their feet. Of the women considered more than 20 percent overweight, 72 percent reported having difficulty finding fashion shoes that fit and 29 percent had problems finding athletic shoes that fit.

<H2>Weight Changes Gait</H2>
Other authors also have attributed gait changes to obesity. During gait cycles, obese individuals have been reported to take significantly shorter steps and walk more slowly. They also have increased step widths, exhibit greater ankle dorsiflexion and less ankle plantar flexion through the gait cycle, increased Q angles, increased hip abduction angles, significantly more abducted foot angles, increased out-toeing, more flat-footed weight acceptance period in early stance, greater touchdown angles, more eversion of the foot, and a faster maximum eversion velocity. Some of these differences, such as increased step width, slower stride, and a more abducted foot position may be secondary to an effort by the obese individual to increase stability. 
<P>Many of the gait changes, including a more abducted foot position, out-toeing, increased Q angles, and increased step widths, also may be attributed to thick thighs. Often, the obese person must rotate one thigh around the other to move forward. Some authors have attributed an increased incidence of overuse injuries to obese individuals during exercise and daily living as a result of these reported differences in gait. 

<H2>Advice for the Practitioner and Patient</H2>
One way overweight patients can avoid lower extremity and foot problems is to maintain good flexibility of the tendons and plantar fascia. 
<P>Moreover, proper shoe fit is essential for preventing secondary foot problems stemming from ill-fitting shoes. Patients should be encouraged to have their feet measured regularly, particularly if there has been a significant weight gain. Individuals should shop for shoes at the end of the day when their feet are at their largest, fit standing to the largest foot, and have 1/2 inch from the end of the longest toe to the end of the toe box. Most importantly, the shoes should be comfortable the moment they are put on.
<P>Should you recommend that your patients lose weight? Although some obesity-related foot changes, such as increased foot size, may be permanent, other lower extremity problems may clear up with weight loss. Gait changes, in particular, could be expected to improve as the patient loses weight. Moreover, it is not necessary for the patient to achieve the so-called "desirable" weight listed in standardized weight tables. Often, shedding some of the excess weight--even 10 percent--can be enormously helpful, not only for your patient's feet and lower extremities, but also for her overall health and well-being. If you don't feel comfortable advising your patients about weight loss, consider referring them to a family physician, general practitioner, internist, hospital-based weight loss program, registered dietitian, or reputable commercial weight loss program for guidance and support.
<P>Further research is needed to determine the full effects of weight gain on lower extremity problems. But health care practitioners dealing with the lower extremities clearly are not exempted from the impact of obesity on their patients' health. With the refractory nature of obesity, together with an $80 billion "weight-loss" industry targeting a seemingly endless variety of fad diets and quick weight loss schemes at overweight Americans, obesity promises to be a weighty problem--one that deserves your attention, and, from your patient's perspective, your support.

<H1>Normal Weight or Overweight?</H1>
<P><I>by Diana Tonnessen</I>
</CENTER>
<P>At what point is a patient considered "overweight" or "obese"? These terms are somewhat controversial, even among those specializing in the treatment of obesity. Practitioners traditionally have relied on standardized height and weight tables since 1959, when the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company issued the first such tables. The weights in those tables were considered "desirable" because they reflected the weights at which mortality was lowest in population studies. In 1983, the tables were revised after a new study found that adults could weigh a little more and still expect good health. Although the 1983 tables initially met with some resistance because of the higher weights, they were quickly embraced by health care professionals and their patients.
<P>Then in 1990, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued new weight tables, entitled <CITE>Suggested Weights for Adults</CITE>. The tables, released amid a flurry of criticism, were even more permissive than previous tables, suggesting that the average American could weigh even more than before without compromising on health or longevity. The USDA tables also raised eyebrows because they included an allowance for a moderate weight gain in the middle years.
<P>However, a number of major studies published in the past few years now suggest that the increased weights mentioned in the USDA tables are not associated with increased longevity, but rather with an increased risk of mortality from heart disease, cancer, and other causes--particularly for women. Moreover, these studies consistently have found that pounds put on in adulthood are particularly dangerous in terms of increased health risks. The most recent of these studies, published in the September 14, 1995 issue of the <CITE>New England Journal of Medicine</CITE>, found that mortality was lowest for women who weighed 15 percent less than the average American woman today. The USDA has revised its weight tables to reflect these new findings. The weights in the new tables, due out the first of the year, have been revised downward overall. Perhaps the most important change is that the new weight tables do not permit Americans to acquire a spare tire around the middle in mid-life. 
<P>"We concur with the new USDA tables," says JoAnn Manson, MD, Co-Director of Women's Health at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, author of two of the recent studies to demonstrate increased health risks to overweight women. But rather than forcing patients to conform to the (sometimes unattainable) norms in weight tables to reduce their cardiovascular risk, Manson prefers to advocate healthy eating and exercise habits. It is probably no coincidence that the very health-promoting habits that have been proven to reduce patients' cardiovascular risk--a low-fat, low cholesterol diet and regular moderate exercise--also are the safest, surest prescription for weight loss.

<H1>The Clinical Consideration of the Ankle Syndesmosis</H1>
<P><I>by Robert S. Adelaar, MD</I>
</CENTER>
<P>Every day the ankle takes a beating. A relatively small structure--considering the body weight that sometimes towers over it--the ankle's peak load can climb to four times body weight with the tibial plafond taking 80 to 90 percent of the burden. The fibula itself accounts for approximately 15 percent of the total load. It's no wonder that ankle fractures with diastasis are the most common complex foot and ankle traumas that practitioners encounter. 
<P>Lateral ankle structures play a critical role in the normal dynamics of ankle motion and stability. With its cartilaginous surfaces, the ankle provides a stable base for considerable load. Even in the loaded position, its range of motion is 32 to 45 degrees. In the unloaded position, range shifts from 12 to 56 degrees, with increases made possible through coupled motions such as the deep deltoid contribution to internal rotation of the talus. This can be from 4 to 8 degrees and occurs during plantar flexion. The fibula also moves during ankle motion. When loaded it rotates externally a few degrees and moves posteriorly and laterally.
<P>The ankle syndesmosis is composed of four structures: the interosseous ligament, the anterior tibio-fibular ligament, the posterior tibio-fibular ligament, and the transverse tibio-fibular ligament. In hydraulic cadaver testing, the percentage resistance to a few millimeters of diastasis was distributed in the following manner: anterior tib-fib ligament was 35 percent, the interosseous ligament was 22 percent, and the posterior tibio-fibular ligament was 43 percent.
<P>The syndesmotic ligament clearly has a dynamic role in ankle biomechanics. J.R. Close, MD has stated that the syndesmosis permits ankle mortise flexibility because of the elasticity of the ligaments--an elasticity that allows intermalleolar distance to change and facilitates tibial and fibular rotation. Slobodan D. Vucicevic, MD, theorizes that the interosseous membrane of this structure is important because it balances the loading of the foot through the fibula. The syndesmosis widens normally with weightbearing and when the foot goes from full plantar flexion to dorsiflexion. The interosseous membrane can accommodate these changes and reach up to 120 percent of its length before failure. As such, the objective in treating ruptures of this complex mechanism is to restore the anatomy of the lateral syndesmosis and allow protective stress during the healing.
<P>The deltoid ligament provides stability to the syndesmosis. The normal deltoid ligament is composed of a superficial component consisting of the tibio-navicular and tibio-calcaneal portions. The deep deltoid is a short broad ligament from the tibia to talus near the deltoid artery, with its important contribution to circulation of the body or the talus.
<P>The deep deltoid is important for resisting the forces that would externally rotate the talus. Our cadaver studies have indicated that the superficial tibio-calcaneal portion of the deltoid ligament is the critical component to providing physiologic contact stresses in the ankle. When the tibio-calcaneal was sectioned, the contact area significantly decreased, elevating the peak pressures and shifting the centroid in a lateral direction on the talus. This alters the theory that the deep deltoid is the important stabilizer of the medial side of the ankle and reconstruction of it would be critical to the maintenance of medial stability. The superficial ligament complex originates from the anterior colliculus of the tibia and the deep deltoid from the posterior colliculus.
<P>Classification terminology in ankle fractures is important. Two major classifications are used: the Danis-Weber-AO and the Lauge-Hansen. The Danis-Weber classifies fractures based upon the location of the fibula and the components of the ankle that have been injured. Ankle fractures that are unstable with diastasis usually are classified as Danis-Weber C injuries.
<P>The Lauge-Hansen classification was developed to describe cadaver fracture patterns. The first part of the terminology refers to the foot position when the forces start; the second refers to the major force that is transmitted to the foot. In the supination external injury, the foot is held in supination and is subjected to external rotation forces. This is the most common type of unstable ankle injury (60 percent). It involves injury first to the lateral structure, starting with the anterior tib/fib ligament, then affecting the remainder of the syndesmosis, fibula, posterior malleolus, and finally the medial bone structures or deltoid. 
<P>The pronation external rotation injury (15 percent) is another common mechanism where the pronated foot is subjected to external rotation forces. The mechanics of the injury are forces that start on the medial side, causing a deltoid avulsion or medial malleolar fracture, and then proceed to the anterior tib/fib ligament and syndesmosis, the fibula, and finally to the posterior malleolar area. 
<P>The pattern of fibular fracture is distinctive. In the supination injury there usually is a long spiral with some comminution. In the pronation injury, the fibula has a short oblique fracture above the mortise.
<P>Due to a variation in rotation and the anatomy of peroneal groove and tibial tubercle, syndesmotic diastasis may be difficult to determine by radiographic criteria. Some authors have reported an intraobserver variability of one millimeter in the radiographic measurement of syndesmotic widening. In our laboratory, the direct strain transducer measurements of tibial-fibular diastasis demonstrated that radiographic analysis is a rather crude measure of the spread of the syndesmosis. Therefore, results that depend on x-ray criteria alone should be suspect. 
<P>Available x-ray criteria consist of the clear space at a point one centimeter proximal to the ankle, consisting of the distance between the lateral posterior tibia and the medial posterior fibula. A space of less than six millimeters is thought to be appropriate. A cartilage clear space of less than two millimeters in the loaded ankle and up to four millimeters in the unloaded ankle is appropriate, and the symmetry between the medial and lateral area is important. The tibio-talar angle is about 83 degrees plus or minus 4 degrees; therefore a greater than 5 degree change in this angle or change in the length of the fibula would be important parameters of x-ray evidence of instability. The posterior tibio-fibular clear space appears to be the most accurate x-ray indicator. In our experience, this space seems to increase with a lateral shift of the fibula and internal rotation of the fibula, and decreases when the fibula externally rotates.
<P>Current syndesmotic biomechanical and clinical data make it difficult to decide how and when to treat the unstable syndesmosis. Stability of the ankle, provided by bone architecture, certainly increases with weightbearing because of the cartilage. In our cadaver evaluations, without injuring the deltoid ligament and doing a complete syndesmotic ligament resectioning, 2.4 millimeters was the average widening. With additional sectioning of the deltoid, this space doubled.
<P>The significance of a lateral talar shift has been thought to increase the peak pressures and decrease the contact areas. In Ramsey and Hamilton's classic work, the tibio-talar contact area was reduced by 42 percent with one millimeter of lateral talar displacement despite the fact that the fibula was rigidly fixed. Michelson showed that normal cadavers with axial load had lateral displacement of up to two millimeters.
<P>In our biomechanical laboratory, we used a transducer to measure the spread or diastasis of the syndesmosis and found that with complete rupture of the syndesmotic ligament there was an average distal tib/fib diastasis of .24 millimeters. Statistical change in the tibio-talar contact area or peak pressure with the deltoid intact also was not found. With sectioning of the deltoid, in addition to complete syndesmotic disruption, the distal tib/fib interval widened to an average of .73 millimeters. This was associated with a 39 percent decrease in the tibio-talar contact area and an average 42 percent increase in peak pressures.
<P>Our study also showed that with complete syndesmotic rupture, the normal deltoid ligament strain increased by 10 percent from baseline. This suggests that the stable articular configuration is held in place by the deltoid ligament and may indicate that the deltoid should be protected from increased stress until the syndesmosis and interosseous membrane heal. Our study also demonstrated that with minimal radiographic changes, significant alterations in tibio-talar joint dynamics can occur.
<P>In our opinion, the clinical implications of the literature data, as well as our cadaver studies, indicate that the syndesmotic complex does not need to be stabilized if there is good lateral and medial fixation of fractures. However, if the deltoid ligament is torn or if there is very poor medial fixation stability, appropriate stabilization of the syndesmosis is then warranted. It is also noted that a completely torn syndesmosis increases stress on the deltoid; as such, one would not want to encourage deltoid stretching during the healing phase with an unstable syndesmosis. Therefore, early mobilization without protection or syndesmotic stabilization is not indicated.
<P>Our indication for syndesmotic fixation is somewhat different than Boden's, who said that syndesmotic stabilization would not be indicated unless the proximal extent of the Type C Danis-Weber fracture was greater that 4.5 centimeters. In our opinion, this is rather arbitrary and does not protect the intact deltoid ligament from abnormal stresses. A stress test should be done under fluoroscopy after initial fixation to determine syndesmotic stability in Danis-Weber B and C injuries. Unfortunately, it takes a long period of time for degenerative changes to occur with inappropriate syndesmotic fixation and current outcome studies usually are short term in nature.
<P>From our additional laboratory work, we agree that using a single 4.5 millimeter fully threaded screw with no lag technique and three cortex fixation is appropriate. The fixation is secure if it is anywhere between two and four centimeters from the ankle joint. To allow the widened part of the talus to be in the mortise, stabilization should be done with the ankle in dorsiflexion. 
<P>In our opinion, the syndesmotic screw should be removed between three and four months after its insertion. We agree with Needleman that syndesmotic fixation prevents normal external rotation of the fibula. However, we also assert that one single screw does not completely immobilize the syndesmosis and still allows some forces to be passed through the ligamentous structures that aid in strengthening the collagen bonding.

<P>Welcome to the <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> Web site. For some of you, the address listed above and thousands more like it are a significant pointer when you access the World Wide Web. But for most of you, the Web is something you have only heard about and addresses like the one above are gibberish. That will change. Soon.
<P>The Internet and the World Wide Web are about to become important facets of any productive practice. The Web will be a way for you to dial into a datastream of 10 million people that's growing every day. It is in fact nothing less than a combination billboard, data exchange, and electronic telephone that links your computer to people across the nation and around the world. Right now, it's an untested jumble of false starts, boring locations, and inactive sites all commingled with extraordinarily valuable information. Getting at that valuable information and being seen by others is the challenge for those on the Web. 
<P>Once you are up and running you will be able to communicate with patients, hospitals, and suppliers. You will be able to access and download medical literature, and do everything else that used to require a phone and a fleet of communication assistants.
<P>Let's get more specific. You'll be able to upload practice information for access by the community--everything from the type of treatment you offer, directions to your office, even a personal color photograph. Patients will be able to ask questions, ask for appointments, and download routine instructions. 
<P>For instance, you'll be able to access suppliers, such as Johnson &#38; Johnson, which is now constructing a Web site for its AB3, MB3, and AS3 braces, so that you will be able to locate suppliers or product literature. Or you could access Allied-OSI and learn about its new Footlight device. 
<P>You'll be able to search FDA announcements, association meeting plans, articles in magazines such as <CITE>Medical Economics</CITE> and <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>, and even news of the day from CNN.
<P>Using an Internet-based E-mail system, your E-mail will appear directly on your desktop. You'll be able to communicate with staffers, colleagues, and patients across the building or across the world as if  they were right outside your office. Complicated spreadsheets, x-rays, letters, and proposals will be exchanged by attaching them to E-mail. 
<P>These are not technologic advances you can expect to see next year. You can have them now. Indeed, <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> uses this technology to unite its three offices in Maryland, Minnesota, and New York. We send messages back and forth, and remember--this is not dialing into America Online for E-mail; messages appear as little envelopes on our computer screens. 
<P>Navigating through all the possibilities can be confusing. If you don't know what you're looking for on the Web, you can waste a lot of time. That's why BioMechanics is now constructing a gateway for our readers: http://www.biomech.com/. From there you'll be able to read what's coming in <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>, and access past issues. You'll even be able to access the listings in our February issue, the <CITE>BioMechanics Desk Reference</CITE>. 
<P>From the <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> Gateway you'll also visit our Mall, where you can access information and catalogues suppliers as well as information about meetings and your own associations. There will be links to government offices, MCOs, news organizations, biomechanical research facilities, and  other publications. And you'll be linked to the consumer-oriented Gateway of <CITE>Stride</CITE>, which will have its own links to practitioner associations and perhaps even to individual practices. 
<P>It's all under construction now and will take some time to build and plenty of effort to update. So be sure to visit and leave us a message.

<H1>Bracing Muscular Dystrophy</H1>
<P><I>by Wally Motloch, CO</I>
</CENTER>
<P>Unlike the strong and heavy paraplegic braces that are subject to extreme use by robust people with powerful arms, muscular dystrophy patients use their bodies carefully and timidly. These patients seldom require heavy duty braces. Instead, muscular dystrophy patients need precisely designed, lightweight devices that work in concert with their weak-muscled bodies.
<P>Muscular dystrophy patients generally start their lives able bodied. They live a normal life for several years as their muscles progressively deteriorate. Eventually, their muscles stop functioning altogether. Although some muscular dystrophy patients have good bones, joints, and nerves, it is their power-supplying muscles that progressively fail them. 
<P>The Muscular Dystrophy Association publishes a list of approximately 40 neuromuscular diseases. Of these 40 diseases only a few categories can benefit from orthotic intervention. These typically are patients with Duchenne, limb girdle, spinal muscular atrophy, and perineal muscular atrophy, which is better known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth.
<P>Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy can be effectively treated with orthoses. At the beginning of the disease process, patients require very little orthotic help--perhaps only AFOs. As their muscles weaken, KAFOs come into play. As the pelvic girdle weakens and the spine starts to deform, HKAFOs with a body jacket become necessary. Eventually, the patient becomes non-ambulatory and the wheelchair becomes the primary mode of transportation.
<P>When bracing muscular dystrophy patients, orthotists can (within limits) enhance their lives by controlling their deformities, maintaining their upright posture control, and prolonging the patient's ambulatory time and distance.
<H2>Deformities Control</H2> 
Controlling joint deformities allows for the best possible pulling levers to maximize the power and efficiency of the weakening muscles. The practitioner should also maintain the straightness of the patient's limbs through the use of orthoses. Follow that by limiting spinal deformities and prolonging pulmonary function. Finally, supporting the torso for comfort and function while sitting is necessary.
<H2>Upright Posture Control</H2>
The ankles, knees, and hips can be braced so that the patient requires very little muscle exertion to stand. This allows patients to remain upright and engage in play and other activities for longer periods of time than otherwise possible. Patients also receive the added benefits of upright posture; improved bone strength due to weightbearing; physical, circulatory, and pulmonary exercise; and increased psychological and emotional well-being by being able to participate in activities that normally require standing.
<H2>Ambulation</H2>
The ability to stand with very little or no muscle power fights fatigue by providing periods of rest and, thereby, prolonging the patient's ambulatory time and distance. Ordinarily, weak patients can't walk very far because walking requires so much energy. With frequent rest stops, patients with muscular dystrophy are able to cover the distances of their everyday lives--from home to school, to work, and around their neighborhoods. This is why it is so vitally important for ambulatory braces to be extremely lightweight with the least possible joint friction <A HREF="#fig 1">(Fig 1).</A> The braces must be well-fitting to minimize binding and aligned to provide hands-free standing <A HREF="#fig 1">(Fig 2).</A> This hands-free standing capability allows walking patients the freedom to periodically rest their arms and shoulders. Not only is walking from point A to point B enhanced, but when patients reach their final destination they can set aside their crutches and use their arms for bi-handed activities.
<P>To extend the period of independence, the locking mechanism of knee and hip joints must require minimum force and dexterity to activate. Avoid using drop locks or complicated knobs; instead, consider an easy operating system such as the "Preselected" hip lock with finger loop <A HREF="#fig 3">(Fig 3).</A>
<P>In transition periods when patients need a walking brace some of the time, and a spinal brace all the time, practitioners should consider a detachable body jacket <A HREF="#fig 3">(Fig 4).</A> This arrangement helps patients to walk as a simple RGO. When they are not walking, however, the body jacket can be disconnected and worn continually to support the patient's collapsing spine.
<P>Occasionally, I see spinal muscular atrophy patients who ambulate in an "IRGO-Lite," but who are reaching the point where their shoulder and arm muscles tire quickly. Walking without supervision then becomes unsafe. To maintain maximum muscle condition and strength, supervised walking can be supplemented with safe exercise by simply building a stand for the ambulatory brace. This can be accomplished at a minimal cost. The stand receives the patient in the brace <A HREF="#fig 5">(Fig 5)</A>, and converts the IRGO to a safe exercising device. The patient benefits in two ways. First, weightbearing strengthens bones. Secondly, exercise strengthens the hip muscles and the pulmonary and circulatory systems. All of this can be accomplished while the patient is watching TV, doing homework, or just mimicking someone else exercising.
<P>In patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth, the orthotist has to control the collapsing/deforming ankle joint complex. The continual struggle with AFOs and conventional ankle joints is that they permanently set the calcaneal angle. As a result, any additional changes require either a lot of work or a new brace. If an orthotist uses the variable angle foot plate with the "COD self-aligning" ankle joints <A HREF="#fig 5">(Fig 6)</A> and attaches the side bars with screws rather than rivets, it is then possible to change the length of the side bar by rotating it and exposing more or less thread, thereby changing the calcaneal alignment angle.
<P>When caring for muscular dystrophy patients, practitioners must remember that generalized muscle weakness affects the whole body. These patients fatigue quickly and recover very slowly. They are very gentle on their devices. Consequently, we can underdesign their devices when compared to accepted standards. Power is at a premium here and the devices must use up as little of it as possible.

<H1>Adaptations for the Amputee Skier</H1>
<P><I>by Michael Joyce, CP</I>
</CENTER>
<P>The loss of a limb doesn't have to be a deterrent when it comes to an active lifestyle. Indeed when I was first introduced to disabled skiing I wondered why many skiers chose to ski without their prosthesis.
<P>A quick education and some common sense told me that skiers with transtibial amputations face two problems: a lack of knee stability and the obvious conflict between walking alignment and skiing alignment with regard to the knee and ankle. Skiers with transfemoral amputations face the same scenario with the added risk of injury to the hip because of rotation between the residual limb and the prosthetic socket when attempting to control the ski over uneven terrain and during turns. Control of the prosthetic knee and its rate and range of flexion present an added difficulty.
<P>A thigh corset and joints can provide knee stability and protection against knee hyperextension during a fall for skiers with a transtibial amputation. But this method is inadequate when attempted on a short residual limb since it offers little control over loss of translation between the limb and the prosthesis and, subsequently, between the prosthesis and the ski. An off-the-shelf knee orthosis with rigid uprights and the ability to control rotation of the thigh within the thigh cuff can be attached with screws to the socket retainer section of the prosthesis. This allows for a quick adaptation to a walking prosthesis and can be donned at the mountain along with other equipment.
<P>Regarding alignment of any ski prosthesis, normal skiing alignment is the goal. That is, weight forward on the ball of the foot to load the front of the ski. The mistake most commonly made is to place heel lifts under the prosthetic heel to wedge the knee into flexion. While this can effectively place the knee in the correct position and cause the weight line to move forward over the toe, it also increases the height of the prosthesis. Now, the affected side knee is forward of the sound side knee and the hip is asymmetrically raised an amount equal to the thickness of the heel lift. Unfortunately, if this point is missed, it produces a myriad of undesirable consequences when trying to control the ski; compensatory wedges placed under the binding only exacerbate this problem.
<P>A better way is to dorsiflex the foot of the prosthesis, changing a walking alignment to a skiing alignment. When the knee is brought forward to the proper angle, which of course will vary with the individual according to size, ability, and style of skiing, careful attention must be paid to overall height to ensure a level pelvis while in the functional position. If working with an endoskeletal prosthesis, as a last resort place lifts under both heels to attain knee flexion while maintaining a level pelvis.
<P>For skiers with a transfemoral amputation who want to ski on two skis, the simplest problem to solve is the tendency of the socket to rotate on the limb because of torque from the ground forces applied to the ski. Successful control of rotation depends mainly on three things:
<UL>
<P><LI>A properly fit, ischial-containing socket that locks onto bony prominences and is therefore significantly more effective at preventing rotation than other socket designs, which rely on soft tissue bearing for stability. Certainly movement is inherent in soft tissue loading vs. bone loading;
<P><LI>A full suction fit that allows the normally occurring friction between the material of the socket and the skin to act as a further rotational control;
<P><LI>A removable "ski belt" attached with a Velcro strap on a "D" ring located at, or slightly above and posterior to, the greater trochanter, circling the pelvis and attaching to a second "D" ring from the same location with another Velcro strap. The wearer can now easily control rotation by tightening the posterior strap to apply an external rotational force or by tightening the anterior strap to apply an internal rotationtional force.
</UL>
<P>With the above considerations in place, the same situation exists at the knee for both the transfemoral and transtibial skier, with one major difference: in the correct knee flexion angle, with the pelvis level, what stops the prosthetic knee from continuing to flex? Before answering that question, it is important to note that a skier must be applying weight continually to one leg while simultaneously unweighting the other. First one leg, then the other; then the first leg again at an increasing rate of speed while at the same time absorbing considerable force.
<P>There are one or two prosthetic knees capable of locking under weightbearing and unlocking when weight is shifted from the prosthesis. Some knees are also capable of resistance to flexion during stance phase at a rate equal to the force applied, although this type of knee does not lock and can only sustain this resistance momentarily. Both types can be used, as can a variety of other, less sophisticated prosthetic knees. Cost and durability must be strongly considered.
<P>The safest, most reliable, and simplest way to prevent unwanted knee flexion using any knee component, however, is to attach a fixed length, flexion limiting strap above and below the knee's center to allow weightbearing at a predetermined knee flexion angle. Once again, this should be determined on an individual basis, according to level of ability, type of skiing, and terrain. High quality parachute cord can be used in multiple layers; Kevlar strand cord or any other high strength material also will work. The strap should be easily adjustable as experimentation and finetuning on the slopes will determine the optimum length.
<P>Once all the prosthetic changes have been made, the skier is ready to hit the slopes. As with non-disabled skiers, however, no one should start skiing without getting into shape first. Plus, everyone benefits from taking instruction from a certified ski instructor.

<H1>Tips on Adaptation</H1>
<P><I>by Jim Willis and Mark Ashford, CP</I>
</CENTER>
<P>Amputee skiing is a sport of adaptations, with each skier facing his or her own personal challenges. Helping skiing patients to meet these challenges requires you to use your creativity on a case by case basis. New ideas and techniques are constantly being field tested on snow covered mountainsides around the world, so you have to keep your eyes and ears open. 
<P>Novice transtibial amputee skiers, for example, can suffer from knee instability and an inability to control the ski on the affected side. If the amputee wears a prosthesis while skiing, then a stability bra--a device to keep the skiis in proper alignment--can be placed on the skis to help control them. To apply the bra, simply drill a hole in the tip of each ski and run an elastic cord through a six-inch metal tube, attaching each end of the cord to the ski tips with a knot. This keeps the tips from crossing and prevents loss of control of the ski on the amputated side. The bra can be removed later once the amputee has developed the necessary control, allowing the skier to progress to higher levels.
<P>With the addition of a waist belt, skiers can achieve more stability and efficiency. Through elastic and webbing wrapped around the waist and attached to the prosthesis, the waist belt lightens the load placed on the leg muscles by the ski and boot. Waist belts increase suspension of the prosthesis and reduce socket pistoning. Not only does this allow better control of the prosthesis and improved skiing, but it makes riding the ski lift less of a challenge. 
<P>Since it is easier for transfemoral amputees to use one ski and outriggers (short skis on the ends of forearm crutches), many do not wear their prostheses while skiing. The outriggers add balance and can be used as crutches when not skiing. However, if the amputee chooses to ski while wearing the prosthesis, the use of a peg prosthesis can be helpful. This limb is duplicated from the skier's usual socket and a detachable pylon is added. This allows amputees to walk on the peg prosthesis when not skiing and to detach the pylon once they hit the slopes. 
<P>Certainly there are many more adaptations that amputees and their prosthetists have developed to meet the challenges of amputee skiing. By listening to the needs of your patients and using a bit of creativity, practitioners can help amputees get the most out of the sport.

<H1>Ski Boot Custom Orthoses</H1>
<P><I>by Murray J. Politz, DPM</I>
</CENTER>
<P>Sailing down the mountain's white face, skiers are flooded with waves of sensory input. Different snow conditions, the terrain, and the skier's level of experience all elicit unique responses from the skier's body. An understanding of the way the body responds to these variables is critical to practitioners considering ski boot orthotic treatment. 
<P>Based on the simplified <A HREF="#levels">skier models</A> listed below, what is considered an appropriate orthosis may depend on the proficiency level of the skier. To fine-tune a custom orthosis for a beginner may not be wise. The foot must pronate to create an edge on the ski at any level, and insufficient or excess pronation must be dealt with. 
<P>Many beginners sit back on their skis and overwork muscles and tendons. Their complaints cannot be handled with orthoses. As in any new sport, balance is paramount. The body has to be in a position of comfort where a blend of skeletal and muscle contraction leads to balance. In skiing, the balance is changing constantly. Overuse of muscles and tendons causes fatigue and strain leading to pain. It is important not to confuse faulty technique--which can't be corrected by orthoses--with biomechanical faults, which can be addressed with appropriate orthoses.

<CENTER>
<H2>The Ski Boot</H2></CENTER>
Ski boots are made of a hard outer plastic shell with a removable padded liner. They come with a foot bed orthosis referred to by ski shops and manufacturers as an insole. The shell comes in full sizes only and the size of the foot bed varies for half sizes. Most experts agree ski boots come in three different types.
<P><B>Rear Entry.</B> This ski boot opens from the rear and allows the foot to slip in. The rear or posterior of the boot can then be closed and buckled from the rear. This boot is the most comfortable, although it usually does not allow enough forward ankle flexion. It is used mostly for beginners and is the type ski shops rent out. Since this boot does not allow forward ankle flexion, many beginners are pushed back on their skis and are unable to balance themselves properly and efficiently.
<P><B>Mid Entry.</B> This boot opens from the front and the rear. A mixture of the front and rear entry boot, it is more comfortable than the front entry boot and easier to get on and off. This boot is used by intermediate skiers who want comfort and some performance.
<P><B>Front Entry.</B> This form-fitting boot buckles up in the front only. It allows for more front ankle flexion and is therefore more suitable for the higher intermediate or advanced skier. This boot allows more dynamic weight shifting for improved balance in changing terrain and snow conditions.

<CENTER>
<H2>Requirements for Orthoses</H2></CENTER>
Foot orthoses are used in ski boots to improve the fit of the boot, to alleviate biomechanical symptoms and faults, or to improve biomechanics and skiing technique. Theoretically, they should do all three, but the type of orthosis may vary depending on which function is most important to the skier.
<P><B>Improve the fit of the ski boot.</B> An orthosis that supports the arch and prevents excess pronation many times improves the fit of the boot. Pressure from the hard outer shell or the boot's inner lining is common. Pain on the bunion joint or 1st metatarsal phalangeal, medial ankle, tailor's bunion, the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, posterior of calcaneous, and medial navicular bone may be eliminated by the addition of an orthosis. The foot position is changed in the boot by the orthosis and pressure is thus eliminated.
<P><B>Alleviate biomechanical symptoms and faults.</B> Biomechanical symptoms relating to overuse should be eliminated with orthoses and appropriate adjunctive treatment and physical therapy. 
<P>A foot maximally pronated from its neutral position cannot produce additional pronation and therefore cannot produce more of an edge to the ski. The ski edge has to be produced by more internal knee and leg rotation and inclination of the total body. These types of maneuvers increase strain to the body and skiing performance suffers. Biomechanical symptoms may include plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, shin splints, and Morton's neuroma symptoms. Structural deformities can be accommodated with softer orthoses and padding in the ski boot. The hard plastic outer shell of the boot can be heat molded or ground to additionally conform around the deformity.
<P><B>Improve biomechanics and technique.</B> Advanced skiers use orthoses for these purposes because they know technique and can feel the skis' edges. This skier has usually modified many foot beds and orthoses for improved performance and has his or her own thoughts on modifications. Practitioners dealing with skiers of this level should listen to them and seriously consider their suggestions before prescribing orthoses.
<CENTER>
<H2>Ski Boot Orthoses</H2></CENTER>
There are five basic different ski boot orthoses. When deciding upon a particular orthosis, proper diagnosis is important and depends upon appropriate history and physical examination. Symptomalogy during and after skiing aids in the diagnosis. When practical, serial or gradual modifications to the orthoses in follow-up visits can prevent too much change, too quickly. Additional skiing information should include the number of days of season skied, the skier's level of experience, the type of ski boot used, and the terrain skied.
<UL>1. The foot bed orthosis that comes from the manufacturer in the ski boot is made of a soft material with a full neutral shell and minimal, if any, arch support. It is basically a filler with minimal support.</UL>
<UL>2. The store-bought orthosis may be of a soft or thick rubber consistency. Its full lining provides minimal support, but still offers more than the manufactured filler.</UL>
<UL>3. The custom orthosis made at the ski boot store may be a cork or foam soft-type orthosis. It is generally full length, but may be ground thin at the forefoot. It is generally a neutral shell with arch support that is heat molded to the foot in semi-weightbearing stance.</UL>
<UL>4. The professional prefabricated orthosis may be full- or 3/4-length. It is generally soft to firm and has a varus tilt to address pronation.</UL>
<UL>5. The professional custom orthosis may be rigid, semirigid, firm, or soft. It may be full- or 3/4-length. It addresses the neutral position of the foot with appropriate varus or valgus posting, either intrinsic or extrinsic.</UL>
<P>Most custom orthoses are fabricated by the ski boot shop. They often improve fit and offer symptom reduction and improved function for minor problems. Most people spend a week or two skiing during each season. For patients who wear orthoses on a regular basis and want a pair for their ski boots, ski shop orthoses or the professionally prefabricated type should suffice.
<P>A custom orthosis is required for the advanced skier who skis several weeks or more during a season and who uses a custom orthosis daily. They may be full- or 3/4-length. In my experience 3/4-length with the filler removed allows room for the toes in the boot. However, a full-length kept thin at the toes may work. The orthoses must fit into the ski boots comfortably and the inner shell must be removed to make certain the orthoses are not too wide or bulky. The orthoses have to allow enough pronation for efficient edge control of the ski. There may be a problem if the rigid orthosis posted allows no pronation.
<P>In my experience, a nonrigid orthosis with intrinsic posting and a slight heel lift is preferred. The slight heel lift alone may limit several degrees of pronation, decrease strain on the tendo-achilles, and place the body somewhat forward in stance. The degree of varus tilt added can be slightly less than originally necessary.
<P>The type of orthosis you recommend to your patient certainly is a matter of individual philosophy. For my part, I have seen beginner skiers who ski five days per year in rear entry boots with expensive custom ski boot orthoses that are too wide to fit their boot comfortably. I also have seen expert skiers who ski 100-plus days a season with extreme pronation wearing prefabricated orthoses and experiencing biomechanical symptoms. These are both examples of poor judgement. With a proper understanding of the biomechanics of skiing, you can avoid these scenarios. 
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3><A NAME="levels">Levels of Experience</A></H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>I. Beginner (levels 1-4).</B>
<BR>The beginner skier starts with a wedge (ski tips in/heels out), turns with a wedge, and matches the skis parallel after the turn. The novice uses both feet as a platform and has almost even weight distribution on both feet. Both feet pronate to create edges with internal rotation of both legs. Turning forces are mainly generated by steering both feet and legs.
<P>
<B>II. Intermediate (levels 5-7).</B>
<BR>The intermediate skier starts with a smaller wedge and matches the skis to parallel earlier in the turn. Weight is distributed with more weight on the outside or downhill ski, and balance can still be a problem. The outside or downhill foot pronates with the leg internally rotated and the knee flexed. The inside or uphill foot supinates with the leg externally rotated and the knee flexed. Turning forces vary but are mainly rotational.
<P>
<B>III. Advanced (levels 8-10).</B>
<BR>The advanced skier starts with paralles skis and is dynamic in nature. Weight distribution is almost 100 percent on the outside or downhill ski with weight borne at medial forefoot at the start of the turn and shifting to the heel as the turn is completed. Flexion is noted at the ankle, knee, hip, and spine. The outside foot pronates with the leg internally rotated. The turning force is extension of the body (center of mass) towards the new turn with weight distribution to the outside foot. The weight distribution goes first to the medial forefoot, then to the inside arch, and finally to the heel. The pressure against the ski bends it, propelling the skier into the new turn.

<H1>Open Architecture</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin Black with Jim Willis</I>
</CENTER>
<P>Last September, in a San Antonio restaurant just a short walk from the site of the national convention of American Orthotics and Prosthetics Association, two men sat down to coffee and appetizers, and within about an hour reached an understanding regarding office scanners that will inevitably rewrite the automated orthotic field. The two men were Jason Kraus of Benefoot and Jeff Bloch of Bloch Orthotic Lab. 
<P>Benefoot, a leading custom foot orthotic laboratory, is now marketing the ScanCast office scanner as a low-cost, high tech alternative to plaster. Bloch Labs is arguably the most automated lab in the nation, possessing numerous scanning and fabrication systems. By using automated technology to keep costs down, Bloch has built his lab's reputation as the Wal-Mart of custom labs. The agreement was simple: Benefoot agreed to open its scanner configuration to be compatible not only with its own milling device, but with Bloch's. For the first time, an office-based foot scanner would expand access, allowing the practitioner to reach more than one lab. It was Kraus' vision to create open-architecture scanning that any cooperating lab, including all competitors, could access.
<P>Scanner development has been spearheaded by various custom foot orthosis labs in a fashion to assure that when this new technology was adopted, their lab received the exclusive benefit. In a sense, scanners would be like telephones that could only dial one location. That in itself limited the viability of scanners. Reaping the considerable benefits of foot scanning automation required practitioners to make a long term commitment to a given lab and its specific orthotic palette. That made little clinical sense to many because every caring provider wants to select his lab and the device based on clinical need, not technologic fiat. Understandably, scanner adoption has been painfully slow and economically unrewarding.
<P>But what if each foot scan could be sent to the lab the practitioner felt was best suited for the indicated device? Then scanners could make the typical practice more productive. Patients could receive their devices more quickly and with less mess. 
<P>The idea is hardly indigenous to Benefoot. Open architecture, networking, or other names for scanner compatibility have been around for years. John Bergmann, DPM, has been advocating the notion for years as he marketed his Bergmann Optical Scanner. Michael Grumbine has long favored it and actually created the greatest opportunity for its success when his ADT set up a network of more than a half dozen labs, including Piedmont, Rocky Mountain, Bloch, Creative, Plus, Gatorthotic, and others. 
<P>But because of competition issues, no one actually brought it this close to reality until now. The two who broke that stalemate were Kraus and Bloch. In essence, Benefoot agrees to become a switchboard for scanner data transmitted by the ScanCast. The ScanCast will have electronic buttons allowing a practitioner to send data to any of several labs. Benefoot will begin with a half dozen or so. The first two will be Benefoot and Bloch. <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> has learned that Kraus is also speaking to Allied-OSI, Burns, KLM, ProLab and Shuster and Richard. At least several of those, including Allied-OSI and ProLab, tell <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> they are willing to commit. Kraus predicts Benefoot's open architecture will come on line before Q2. 
<P>"The idea of having one scanner that can serve the whole industry is a great idea," says Ethyl Ewing, general manager of Allied-OSI. "I had hoped, however, that the scanner would come from an outsider (such as Cyberware) rather than a lab with a vested interest such as Benefoot. Networking on a scanner owned by a competitor is an issue. But we are willing to go ahead. This agreement will be significant."
<P>Overcoming the competition issues means the labs must allow Benefoot access to a portion of their doctor bases, while Benefoot must create a technologic infrastructure to service the other labs. Economics drives it all. Each lab will pay a small fee to use Benefoot's switchboarding. Benefoot gets to sell scanners with widespread appeal regardless of specific lab loyalties. Benefoot in essence rewrites the rules on scanners. Henceforth, it will be folly to market a scanner that does not employ open architecture. 
<P>The net winner in this giant step forward is the practitioner, who can finally use foot scanning technology as a clinical tool rather than a marketing gimmick. As such, that meeting in San Antonio between Kraus and Bloch was a turning point. 
<P>Bergmann's spokesperson says he is currently working on agreements with seven other labs. And if ADT's years-delayed scanner does actually release by this summer, it will not be able to compete unless it too adopts open architecture.
<P>Eventually every scanner will have to be compatible with a multiplicity of labs in order to compete. By the same token, every leading lab will need to distinguish itself by compatibility to scanners in order to survive.

<H1>The Foam Zone</H1>
<P><I>by Lauren S. Jones, DPM, and Mark Caselli, DPM</I>
</CENTER>
<P>During locomotion--as body weight transfers from one foot to another--pressure equal to 60 percent body weight is thrust upon the plantar tissues of the foot in 0.02 seconds. 
<P>Foam materials have been used to minimize the magnitude of the compression and shear to the foot as it comes in contact with the ground or floor during locomotion. These materials have been incorporated as an interface between the plantar surface of the foot and the shoe sole. They provide shock attenuation, friction reduction, and weight dispersion to protect the normal--and especially the denervated--foot from these harmful forces, thus relieving pain and preventing potentially serious medical problems. 
<P>Foams are manufactured by injection of air or augmenting a given material with chemical additives. They may be either natural (i.e., natural rubber), or synthetic (i.e., synthetic rubber or plastic).
<P>It is important to distinguish between open cell and closed cell foams. Open cell foams have air chambers that communicate with each other as well as the material's surface. As such, fluids such as perspiration can flow through to permit evaporation and heat dissipation. In a closed cell foam, each air chamber is a separate, sealed sphere--cut off from each other and the material's surface. Since closed cell foams do not absorb or retain moisture, they often are employed as insulation. 
<P><B><I>Rubber Foams.</I></B> The term <I>rubber</I> refers to a group of compounds (both natural and synthetic) with elastic properties. The chemical industry classifies this group as <I>elastomers</I>. Natural rubber is obtained from the sap of the rubber tree and is referred to as natural latex; it is chemically known as 1,3 cis-butadiene.
<P>In 1839, American inventor Charles Goodyear accidentally discovered the process of vulcanization, whereby rubber is strengthened and hardened by adding heat and sulphur. Vulcanization also makes the rubber more elastic and resistant to oil. Manufacture of synthetic rubber, however, did not begin in earnest in the United States until a century later, during WWII. 
<P>In the mid-1930s, Dupont invented neoprene, a polychloroprene. Once a Dupont trademark, neoprene is now used extensively industry-wide in the manufacture of foot orthoses, usually on the undersurface of a rigid or semirigid plastic shell. It is used as a balancing or posting material and is also used for providing some degree of cushioning and shock absorption to the orthosis. Due to its excellent resistance to wear, oxidation, and heat, as well as good resistance to oil and gasoline, neoprene is often also used as a shoe soling material.
<P>Since it is resilient and highly shock absorbent, rubber is capable of fulfilling a variety of functions in foot orthoses. So many varieties of rubber can be produced by compounding that it is often possible to produce a specific, single-application material.
<P>In biomechanics, latex foams are the most commonly used of the natural rubber foams. Latex foams are used both as insoles in footwear and as cast padding. It is an open cell rubber that is washable, odorless, and can be cemented to other materials for use as insoles, foot cushions, and soft linings. It is available in 1/8-, 1/4-, and 1/2-inch sheets, often with a fabric topcover.
<P><B><I>Neoprene.</I></B> Until 1967, insoles in athletic shoes were fabricated from open cell latex foams, open cell polyurethane foams, leather, or woven fabrics. In an attempt to produce an insole that would better absorb lateral and oblique forces and decrease the problem of blisters, Wayman Spence, MD, and Marlin Shields, PT, approached several new technologies in the rubber industry. Studies indicated that a closed cell rubber foam would be best suited for their purpose since this material was used commercially to make gaskets when lateral motion had to be absorbed to insure a continuous seal. The gliding motion of the individual cell chambers accounted for their ability to move both laterally and vertically.
<P>To avoid rupture of the cells in the closed cell foam insole, its developers realized that during the foaming process growth needed to be limited to a certain size. This was accomplished by exposing uncured neoprene to nitrogen gas at a pressure of 5,000 Psi, which yielded a foam that could absorb 1cm of lateral movement without rupturing.
<P>Due to the difficulty encountered in sliding the foot over the surface of a rubber insole, a topcover of multi-stretch nylon was laminated to the neoprene foam and a standard thickness of 1/8 inch was chosen. The resulting product was named Spenco. Initially, these insoles were tested with a group of 200 athletes and were found to be effective in preventing blisters.
<P>Spenco insoles--currently available in 1/8-, 1/4-, and 3/32-inch thicknesses--absorb vertical forces, torque, and fore, aft, and lateral sheer, preventing blisters in athletes. Spenco insoles also are useful in preventing neuropathic and rheumatoid ulcerations by reducing the increased plantar foot pressure responsible for skin breakdown.
<P>Then there's, Lynco, an open cell neoprene foam insole with a nylon topcover (available in 1/8-inch thickness), which better dissipates heat. However, due to its open cell structure, some feel that Lynco is not as good a shock attenuator as Spenco.
<P><B><I>Silicone Polymer.</I></B> Silicone polymer is a unique type of foam which, when mixed with cellulose and a blowing agent, produces a material that simultaneously expands and cures. According to <CITE>Orthotics, Etc.</CITE>, by John Redford, MD, and Sidney Licht, MD, it was initially used by the ski industry to assure optimal fit of ski boots before also being adopted to line prosthetic device sockets.
<P><B><I>Polyurethane Foam.</I></B> Polyurethane foam is a thermoset material, generally non-heat moldable, that is often manufactured as an open or closed cell foam. The open cell application is more commonly used. 
<P><B><I>Poron.</I></B> Poron, an open cell polyurethane foam made from a combination of polyether and polyester resins, was developed by the Rogers Company utilizing a patented process. Until fairly recently it was marketed by Langer Biomechanics Group under the name of PPT. Today, however, PPT is no longer made of Poron, although Poron is still distributed by such vendors as JMS, Benefoot, ACOR, and AliMed. Medical-grade Poron is used wherever the reduction of pressure from static and dynamic forces are to be achieved, as in the production of foot orthoses, prostheses, or shoe inlays. These polyurethane foams are stable in form; they are elastic, shock-absorbing, odorless, and washable. 
<P>As an open cell foam, medical-grade Poron dissipates heat well and, by allowing water vapor transmission, enables perspiration to be transmitted away from the foot. This open cell nature also allows the air to circulate according to the weight lying on the material. Thus, this foam retains its form stability and always returns to its original position, even after permanent load. When used as a shock attenuating, soft tissue supplement for the plantar foot it is available in thicknesses ranging from 1/16 - 1/2 inch in a single durometer. The material is manufactured both perforated and non-perforated with a variety of surfaces and topcovers including smooth, abraded, felt, and multi-stretch nylon.
<P><B><I>Rigid polyurethane.</I></B> Rigid polyurethane is used in a two-component system of resin and hardener that after mixing will set in five to ten minutes, requiring 30 minutes to reach full strength. Applications include the fabrication of temporary casts and splints, as well as shaped covers for orthoses and prostheses.

<H2>Plastic Foams</H2>
<B><I>Polyethylene Foam.</I></B> Polyethylene (PE) foam is a synthetic material classified as a polyolefin, which is a thermoplastic. These foams are closed cell foams that are nontoxic, resistant to chemicals and fluids, light in weight, and, when heated to suitable temperatures, are moldable. They are readily washable and discourage bacteria growth. Orthotic shells may be fabricated using one type of PE foam or by laminating different PE foams together. A variety of PE foams are available in assorted durometers or hardnesses. 
<P>Polyethylene foams are manufactured under different trade names, with each company implementing its own system to name the material's various durometers. Some of the more commonly encountered trade names of PE foams are Plastazote, Pelite, Evazote, AliPlast, and SOS (Surgical Orthopedic Splinting--a brand name given to Plastazote by a distributor).
<P>Plastazote originally received fairly extensive clinical use in the 1960's by Paul Brand, MD, for the treatment of the insensate foot of leprosy patients, according to the article, <CITE>The Use of Plastazote to Accomodate Deformities in Hansen's Disease</CITE>, published in Leprosy Review in 1969. The PE foam was used as a shoe insert or more frequently constructed into a shoe or sandal. It offered protection by eliminating high pressure points to feet which have lost all sensation, as well as to feet which have actually undergone ulcerations.
<P>Others also soon discovered Plastazote's qualities and began using it around the same time. Plastazote foams are known for their memory or ability to retain moldable shape, as well as for their smooth, dry feel. They are generally categorized according to durometer and stiffness: soft, medium, firm, rigid, and hard. Applications include the relief of pain associated with burns, plantar facial strain, synovitis, hyperesthesia, and high pressure points of the deformed foot. They are also used in the treatment of skin breakdown as seen in diabetic foot ulcers and, when combined with fillers, produce durable insoles for transmetatarsal amputations.
<P>Available as perforated and non-perforated, in thicknesses ranging from 1/16 - 1 inch and in three densities, the successful use of Plastazote in the treatment of a wide variety of foot problems depends on the correct prescription and skilled construction of the shoe inlay.
<P>AliPlast is a polyethylene foam, comparable to Plastazote, manufactured in four densities and available in a non-perforated form only. Evazote, available in one density, is extremely self-accommodating and lightweight. Pelite, commonly used as a liner for prosthetics, is available in four durometers. Surgical Orthopedic Splinting, available in thicknesses from 1/4-inch to 1-inch, is used primarily as a splinting material to prevent skin contracture in the treating of deep dermal burns.

<H2>Polyvinyl Chlorides (PC)</H2>
Dynafoam is a polyvinyl chloride foam compound. The material is closed cell, thermosetting, odorless, and water resistant. It is self-accommodating and quickly forms an impression of the foot or other high pressure area, and is therefore useful in covering braces and orthoses.
<P>Other polyvinyl chloride foams such as Benefoam, Biofoam, Castofoam, and Foamart can be used to capture semi-or full-weight-bearing impressions of the foot by placing a three-inch slab of the foam on the floor and pressing the foot into it.
<P>The wide variety of foams available today can be traced to a limited number of natural and synthetic materials. They can be used to achieve a variety of goals, and when combined can fulfill a variety of functions in orthotics.
<P>Obviously, there is no ideal foam. Each type has both advantages and disadvantages. However, each material should be evaluated on the basis of defined chemical and mechanical properties such as durability, elastic memory, weight, temperature dependent behavior, bulk, grindability, and workability. With this understanding, the practitioner may subsequently balance the positive and negative features of each material and choose the foam or combination of foams best suited to the patient's situation.

<H1>Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome or Diabetic Neuropathy</H1>
<P><I>by David M. Davidson, DPM; Jeffrey M. Carrel, DPM; and Kenneth T. Goldstein, DPM</I>
</CENTER>
<P>Differentiating between early diabetic neuropathy and tarsal tunnel syndrome may not always be easy. The term entrapment neuropathy has been described as a region of localized injury and inflammation of a nerve caused by mechanical irritation at a point where a nerve either courses through a fibrous tunnel or changes course over a fibrous or muscular band. Trauma--either exogenous or endogenous--that occurs in an area (in this case, under the lacinate ligament) can maintain an inflammatory response. Depending upon the duration of the irritation and the body's reaction, this response can range from localized swelling of the nerve to fibrosis.
<P>A case in point found an Insulin-dependent diabetic patient presenting with constant numbness to the plantar surfaces of both feet. Taken together, the combination of diabetes and bilateral numbness is a classic indicator of neuropathy. Oddly enough, further testing revealed a positive Tinel's sign as well as bilateral Vallieux phenomenon at the tarsal tunnel level. Ultimately the positive Tinel's sign would prove to be a so-called "false-positive" indicator, although at the time it seemed to point toward the tarsal tunnel.
<P>In the end, results from a nerve conduction test confirmed the original diagnosis of neuropathy and the patient was referred to her primary physician. Had the attending physician gone with his initial suspicion, an accurate--albeit premature--diagnosis would have been made. If, however, a decision was made based on the positive Tinel's sign, an initial misdiagnosis would follow, resulting in a delay of proper treatment.
<P>An accurate diagnosis resulted only because informed steps were taken. In today's managed care environment, however, multiple testing is under close scrutiny. The burden, then, is on us to sharpen our diagnostic skills. Only then will we be able to justify the costs associated with subsequent, more conclusive testing. 
<P>Long-standing cases of tarsal tunnel syndrome present with secondary signs that make the diagnosis rather obvious. These signs may include atrophy of the muscles supplied by the motor portion of the nerve and sensory changes in the skin supplied by the sensory portion. 
<P>Objective symptoms of nerve compression and irritation usually are present and include parenthesas and dysesthesias--most commonly burning, tingling, and numbness. Correlating the sensory involvement with the presence and location of the Tinel's sign permits localization of the entrapment. Locating the entrapment point may be aided by using a tuning fork that is activated and placed over the course of the nerve. The tuning fork is moved progressively along the course of the nerve; as the entrapment point is reached the tuning fork will elicit the patient's symptoms (similar to that elicited in a Tinel's sign). Patellar and knee reflexes usually are abnormally depressed or absent in distal symmetrical polyneuropathy and are usually unaffected in tarsal tunnel syndrome.
<P>A typical entrapment neuropathy of the tibial nerve may cause burning that involves the toes and plantar surface of the foot, or a portion thereof. If the calcaneal nerve is predominately involved, the focus of pain will be at the heel. There also may be referral of pain proximally. History may reveal a traumatic background. In other cases the traumatic basis may be more vague.
<P>Fracture or dislocation involving the malleoli, talus, or calcaneus are among the more common causes of posterior tibial nerve entrapment. Ankle sprain with or without ligamentous rupture is also a common cause. Tendon injury causing a space-occupying lesion within the tarsal tunnel may also produce pressure on the nerve. We have seen many cases of varicosities causing similar symptoms. 
<P>In earlier studies we proposed that abnormal pronation traumatizes the nerve as it creates tension of the lacinate ligament and pressure on the nerve at the superior border of the tarsal canal. This occurs because abnormal pronation causes a torque or twist to occur in the lacinate ligament, which crosses both the ankle and the subtalar joints.
<P>When the patient presents evidence of diabetes, however, the practitioner must be careful to distinguish between the symptomatology and decide whether those symptoms are attributable to nerve entrapment at a specific point or to generalized neuropathy. 
<P>The first description of the manifestations of diabetic neuropathy were made in 1864. To this day researchers are still hard at work attempting to answer questions of etiology. Aldose reductase inhibitors have not proven to be of as much value as was originally hoped. Sorbital pathway metabolism interference hasn't seemed to change clinical neuropathy symptoms. It appears that the development of diabetic neuropathy results from a combination of hyperglycemia, insulin insufficiency, vascular insufficiency, and metabolic abnormalities of the nerve, possibly related to abnormal sorbital accumulation.
<P>Sural nerve biopsy usually shows axonal loss and a decrease in fiber density. These findings usually accompany the start of neuropathy in the person with diabetes. As fiber loss progresses, neuropathy worsens. When severe fiber loss occurs the foot is subject to neuropathic ulcerations.
<P>Many neuropathies can occur in a diabetic patient; distal symmetrical polyneuropathy is the most common. In these cases, practitioners may see a range of clinical features including--but not limited to--paresthesias, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, radicular pain, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and loss of vibratory and position perception. The onset of this neuropathy is usually insidious and involves a demyelinating course rather than frank entrapment.
<P>Obviously, when nerve entrapment with diabetes mellitus occurs it is often quite difficult to arrive at a distinct diagnosis. Nerve conduction studies are the most sensitive and reliable measurement of both diabetic neuropathy and nerve entrapment. Early abnormalities observed in patients with diabetic neuropathy include a decrease in conduction time, diminished amplitude, and increased dispersion of sensory action potentials. At times, motor conduction velocity may be diminished.
<P>It is important to test more than one nerve to minimize any false positive findings. In an entrapment, the right posterior tibial nerve, for example, may show abnormal conduction velocity whereas the left posterior tibial nerve, and other nerves on the right foot, may be normal. In dealing with diabetic neuropathy more than one nerve of the same foot will be involved; therefore, practitioners will see multiple abnormal conduction times. In addition, sural nerve latencies are usually slow, as are those of the median nerve at the wrist. These two nerves often are the first to show electrical evidence in peripheral neuropathy.
<P>When tarsal tunnel syndrome occurs unilaterally there is little confusion with diabetic neuropathy. Neurologic findings above the mid-leg are almost always normal. In diabetic polyneuropathy, objective findings usually are bilateral, although the clinical complaint may initially be unilateral. To help practitioners stay abreast of these distinctions, objective testing using nerve conduction studies, electromyography and nerve biopsy are briefly reviewed.

<H1>Treating Patients with Rheumatic Disease</H1>
<P><I>by Roxane L. McNeal, PT</I>
</CENTER>
<P>Few things are as soothing to the human body as immersion in water. This is especially true for patients suffering from the often severe aches, pains, and stiffness of rheumatic disease. 
<P>Patients with various rheumatic diseases may present with similar complaints of symptoms involving the musculoskeletal system. Many patients also experience side effects from treatment (medications or immobilization for example), as well as complications of the disease. The signs and symptoms of musculoskeletal dysfunctions addressed by aquatic physical therapy can be in any combination of the following:

<UL><LI>variable levels of pain and stiffness
<LI>impaired cardiovascular endurance
<LI>early fatigue
<LI>musculoskeletal weakness
<LI>joint complications of laxity, contractures, and altered biomechanics
<LI>postural compensations and dysfunctions
<LI>frequent relapse</UL>

<P>These symptoms and patterns of recurrence demand that the practitioner pay critical attention to an appropriate balance of rest and activity. Rest is needed to recover from physical demands and to reduce inflammatory conditions. Exercise is necessary to reduce joint stiffness, prevent muscle atrophy, and improve muscle strength and endurance. Treatment may need to be modified frequently as the individual symptoms can fluctuate from day to day. A focus on long-term treatment goals is necessary but should not override the specific daily needs of the patient.

<H2>Goals</H2>
Aquatic therapy can be used as an adjunct to land-based physical therapy or as a substitution. The goals may be specific to one symptom or complaint and used on a short term basis (increasing muscle strength one grade, increasing shoulder ROM 25 degrees, achieving normal gait without assistive device, and so on). On the other hand, aquatic therapy may be used for general conditioning, instruction of proper body mechanics and exercise technique, and to progressively modify current exercise routines so that independent programs can be maintained after appropriate discharge from therapy. 
<P>Aquatic therapy also may be used during transitional times in rehabilitation such as:

<UL><LI>during limited weightbearing status 
<LI>during remission for conditioning
<LI>during exacerbation for pain relief and ROM
<LI>when other forms of therapy are not tolerated on land 
<LI>when weakness or pain results in unstable posture, poor proximal stabilization of surrounding joints, failure to move against gravity, and intolerance of manual contact
<LI>in preparation for surgical procedures</UL>

<P>Reevaluations in the office should be scheduled to determine objective outcomes and provide guidance on a continued treatment plan. The reevaluation also will determine if and when land based therapy is indicated in the overall treatment of the patient. 

<H2>Special Considerations</H2>
Patients should be monitored carefully during aquatic therapy for signs of overexertion, fatigue, cardiovascular distress, and resultant postural compensations and deterioration of technique. The physical requirements of traveling to the facility, changing clothes, showering, walking to the parking lot, etc., must be considered in the daily level of muscular and cardiovascular exertion. Limited participation also may occur secondary to unrelated medical complications such as open wounds from injury to fragile skin, slow healing, or infection. Patients who have deconditioned due to
necessary bed rest and those with multiple illnesses possibly due to a depressed immune system also require special attention.
<P>Adjustments in treatment may be required if changes in vision have been noted with vascular disease or as a result of side effects of medication. Entering and exiting the pool may require contact guarding. Patients may have difficulty maneuvering steps, assessing the height of the step, or gauging the depth of the water. Balance in the water also may be difficult without focusing on a fixed object and constant movement of the water may maximize changes in visual perception.

<H2>Exercise Techniques</H2>
A diverse selection of exercises may encourage patient compliance and assist in meeting goals in a timely manner. The wide variety of techniques available helps to achieve multiple goals. Ideally, the exercises simulate normal movement patterns with the appropriate joint stabilization. Combined exercise techniques adapted to the individual patient should be incorporated in each treatment plan.
<P>Passive range of motion may be tolerated when active movements are painful. The relaxation that water causes and the assistance of the therapist may result in greater increases in motion. Preservation of full movement will prepare the patient for active exercises when appropriate. Assisted, active, and resistive exercises can be altered by changing the lever arm, increasing the turbulence of the water, changing the speed of the movement, changing the direction of the movement, and adding resistive devices (mitts, paddles, or dumbbells).
<P>Isometric contractions strengthen the muscle with little joint involvement and provide postural stabilization. This stabilization is emphasized immediately in the pool and is required prior to advancement of exercise speed and difficulty. Isometrics are easily incorporated into the treatment with stabilization of the upper extremity (holding onto the pool side) and the lower extremity (standing on one leg).
<P>Eccentric and concentric exercises are necessary to provide functional carryover to movements on land. Patients need to learn to control their bodyweight and maintain their posture against gravity. Specific exercises can be performed in varying depths of water to simulate functional movement patterns. These include steps, ladder, transition from sit to stand, reaching, bending to dress, and lifting.
<P>Closed and open kinetic chain exercises are easily adapted to the pool. Closed kinetic chain exercises provide good stabilization around lax joints with contraction of surrounding muscle groups. Open kinetic chain exercises are frequently used for range of motion, strengthening, proximal stabilization with distal movement, and when weightbearing is not tolerated through the extremity.
<P>Cardiovascular and muscular endurance activities are performed more easily in the water than on land. Lap work can be modified with a variety of methods and changes in stroke mechanics can accommodate any joint limitations or weaknesses. The addition of assistive devices can make the difference between success and failure: use belts and pull buoys for body position; flippers and paddles for propulsion; and snorkels and masks for easier breathing.
<P>Deep water exercises are very enjoyable and can be modified for all levels of endurance. Deep water keeps the body in a vertical position, neutral positioning is easily maintained and the head and face are kept out of the water. Pacing the cardiovascular intensity is controlled by the speed and intensity of the movement. Various movements such as running, flutterkick, knee flexion and extension without hip movement, and straddle kicks can all be used for variety. The upper extremities can be used for balance and to control trunk rotation if held out to the sides with dumbbells. The upper extremities can be moved in different patterns to increase the intensity of the exercise. To aid in upper extremity strengthening, trunk rotation, arm circles, running motion, sculling, push and pull movements, and figure eights are useful.

<H2>Guidelines for Treatment</H2>
Initiating and rendering appropriate aquatic therapy treatment requires constant reassessment. Modifications of exercises may be required since some patients may be unable to tolerate even the most conservative exercise. A variety of exercises are necessary to challenge the patient, stimulate interest, and progress toward goals.
<P>Trunk stability is emphasized early to strengthen the abdominal and back muscles and provide the base for distal extremity movement. This training also aids in reinforcing postural alignment and relieving some joint weightbearing surfaces and the strain on soft tissue.
<P>For patients with rheumatic disease, gait training in the water is clearly beneficial. With the lessened effect of gravity, gait patterns may be less painful and less physically demanding. Therefore, proper heel to toe patterns, equal weight shift, trunk rotation, and arm swing can be encouraged and performed repeatedly without compensation.
<P>Diaphragmatic breathing should be taught and incorporated into every session to reinforce efficient inhalation and exhalation. It also aids in the recruitment of the abdominal muscles and discourages breath holding. Respiratory distress needs to be monitored if the pressure against the chest with submersion or the increased demands of exercise lead to breathing difficulties.
<P>Patients with rheumatic disease may feel great in the water and then experience extreme fatigue and general malaise after a treatment session in the pool. Movements in the water are deceptively easy compared to exercise on land. Energy conservation is critical for those patients who commonly overexert themselves through inefficient postures and poor biomechanics. The key to progression is to balance the appropriate level of exercise with rest or modified activity and ADL.
<P>Aquatic exercises can be done three to four times per week with sessions lasting anywhere from 15 minutes to one hour depending on the current ability of the patient. Muscle fatigue is desirable to a certain degree, and so is muscle stretching. No exercise should be done if it reproduces any sensation of pain or current symptoms. All aquatic therapy exercises can be modified to accommodate the individual patient; as such, it is ideal for patients suffering from the aches, pains, and stiffness that can accompany rheumatic diseases.

<H1>A New Trend for Insoles</H1>
<P><I>by Cynthia Emmel Mullaly</I>
</CENTER>
<P>Picture this. You're at a shoe store in a mall, and you overhear the following exchange between two shoppers. "I can't decide," says one, "between this pair of shoes with an EVA heel cup, and that one with dual density foam in the toebox." Five years ago, such a scenario would have been laughable. And while shoe insoles are nothing new, the fact is that until rather recently, the vast majority of factory provided insoles were worthless bits of inexpensive material.
<P>Historically, a shoe's insole served a functional purpose. Because lasting tacks were used during the construction process, rough perforations remained on the inner part of the sole, irritating the foot. Since these tacks were crucial to the manufacturing process, thin leather interfaces were added, protecting the foot from the jagged edge left once the tacks were removed.
<P>Innovation soon allowed manufacturers to construct a shoe without the aid of these tacks. By then, however, the interface was firmly entrenched as a standard component, albeit one of little therapeutic benefit. That's not to say, though, that today's factory-installed insole, or sock liner as they are known in the trade, is without value. 
<P>More and more shoe manufacturers have started to pay as much attention to the insides of their products as they do to the outsides. Flimsy pieces of latex have given way to biomechanically correct inserts with complicated designs. Factors such as shock absorption and long-lasting construction no longer receive short shrift from shoe companies. Features such as contoured design, metatarsal support, heel cradles, arch support, and the use of moisture wicking and antibacterial materials have become selling points. Manufacturers such as Easy Spirit, Mephisto, Rockport, and Lowell include detailed illustrations in their advertising extolling the virtues of their insole design. 
<P>With the availability of comfort footwear at an all-time high, the astute practitioner should have at least some knowledge of what's inside his or her patients' shoes. Remember, this interface will be affecting your patients before they ever come to you, or just after they have left your office.
<P>The most desirable arrangement allows for a removable insole. "Removable insoles found in traditional or therapeutically-inclined footwear definitely add to the shoes, making them more comfortable and providing more cushioning and arch support to the foot," says Kathy Conway, C.Ped, of Colaizzi Pedorthic Center in Pennsylvania. "They are a big plus when you need to remove them to provide your client with a custom-made orthosis. Also, when the factory-installed insert compresses, it can be removed and replaced." 
<P>Ryka Inc.'s John Tranfaglia, vice president of International Sales, says that a full 90 percent of his company's inserts are removable. Mephisto offers hand-finished shoes and sandals that include two removable inserts made from latex, leather or cork and finished with a leather covering; thus an orthopedic insert can be swapped for a "reflex" insert, which can be worn for 20 minutes or so, providing extra stimulation to the feet. The company acknowledges that sales of replacement inserts, which range from $14 to $24, are very profitable. Finn-Comfort advertises two sets of insoles for its leading models as a major consumer drawing card. Danish footwear manufacturer Ecco produces men's and women's shoe styles with removable inserts made from a combination of foam and leather.  More companies plan to make removable inserts part of their shoe selling game plan in the near future. 

<H2>Materials</H2>
Materials used to fabricate these inserts tend to vary according to the shoe category and, of course, the maker. Therapeutic shoes, for example, have always valued a clinically-appropriate insole, and generally aim for a higher degree of compression set resistance. Compression set resistance affects the overall time an insert or insole takes to return to its original shape. In other words, the material is able to resist bottoming out--becoming thin and stiff--due to repeated stress from body weight. Bottoming out tends to occur at pressure points such as the ball of the foot, the toe and heel.
<P>Plastazote has a high compression threshold and is able  to take a direct impression of the foot quite well. Poron, on the other hand, does not bottom out, nor does it take an impression. It bears weight, always returning to the same thickness. Thus, when combined, the two materials provide an over-the-counter insert ideal for customizing. Drew Shoe Company, well known for its line of therapeutic footwear, makes a dual-density, heat moldable Plastazote insert covered with Poron that allows for simple modifications. 
<P>The comfort shoe revolution is also creating biomechanical windfalls for consumers and patients. Lowell Shoes, for example, has taken the layered approach to a new level with its Supreme Cushion Foot Bed, an insert that seems to have more separate parts than a pocket watch. Utilizing several densities of foam throughout, Lowell also features a built-in steel shank just beneath the insert to ensure lateral stability. Ecco, meanwhile, offers a broad range of environmentally friendly inserts made from recycled material--anything from Freon free polyurethane to a separate heel stabilizer.
<P>Insert materials commonly used for what might be called traditional "street shoes" include leather, latex, cork, non-memory foams, polyurethane, and EVA. Polyurethane offers acceptable resiliency, cushioning, support, and shock absorbency, which--compared to other materials--means less bottoming out. EVA, on the other hand, tends to compress over time, breaking down faster than polyurethane, according to Mark Caselli, DPM. EVA is, however, useful in the manufacture of thin inserts.
<P>"Ultimately, the type of insole provided in a pair of shoes really becomes a marketing decision on the part of the footwear company," says Marc Cotnoir of Rogers Corporation, which produces Poron. "Most shoe companies do not make their own insoles," he says, "so contract fabricators will produce whatever the companies want. Better companies select materials to maintain their good reputation, looking at long term performance as a criteria." 

<H2>Benefits</H2>
So what are the benefits derived from these increasingly well-constructed, albeit nonfunctional devices? Should they be immediately replaced with a more substantive device? "If you don't need the added benefits of an orthosis," answers Justin Wernick, DPM, an expert on orthotic devices, "and if the insole is a good one, your patient can stay with the insole that came in the shoe."
<P>Many professionals assert that preloaded insoles and inserts can actually help with minor problems and are fine for normal foot function and range. Being able to swap one insert for another greatly enhances a shoe's overall value.
<P>What inserts won't do, however, is alter foot function and gait. "Pathologic conditions such as flat foot deformity, a cavus foot type, or metatarsalgia need to be controlled with an orthosis or with surgery," says David Caldarella, DPM, of the Florida Center for Foot and Ankle Disorders in Sarasota. "However, regarding cushioning and support, these insoles can be more helpful than not having them at all." 
<P>There has been some talk about producing inserts with built-in pronation and supination devices. Practitioners know this would be self-medication. Many in the shoe industry know it as well. "Unless well-informed and knowledgeable about their feet, clients could easily choose the wrong insole," acknowledges Rockport International Biomechanist Becky Snow, ATC, who adds, "this would be a clear case of self-diagnosing and wouldn't be good." 
<P>Moreover, although many insoles will help avoid a deteriorating condition because they do absorb shock, caution must be used on a case by case basis. Patients with sensitive feet, for example, may derive an added degree of relief from one factory-installed insert, while the same device might aggravate another's condition. If an insert's arch is too high and the patient has flat feet, pressure build-up in that area will cause pain. Depending on the materials used, patients can experience a reaction that may present in the form of a rash or burning sensation. 

<H2>Longevity</H2>
The life of a removable insert varies from person to person. Shoe industry research groups and manufacturers generally perform a variety of tests to determine how long an insert will last. But it's all guess work and approximations. Wear and tear--as well as the overall life expectancy of the device--all depend on what it is made of, not to mention the use of the shoe and how frequently it is worn. But the single most important factor is the type of foot in the shoe. A person with a medial foot, for example, tends to wear down an insert faster than someone with a high arch. And this much, says Cotnoir, is also true: "The insole will never be better or worse than the materials used."
<P>When it's all said and done, the rationale behind removable inserts is to supplement comfort and support. If an insert can be removed, whether for accommodative reasons or to simply expedite drying, it provides all involved--practitioner and patient alike--with more options from which to choose.

<H2>Dialing for demographics</H2>
American demographics continue their ethnic shift. By 2010, according to Census Bureau data, Hispanics will constitute the nation's largest minority group, followed closely by Asian Americans. 
<P>What's being done to bridge the language barriers, varying cultural expectations and immigrant medical beliefs?
<P>From Miami's Little Havana to San Francisco's Chinatown, HMOs, insurers, and practitioners have begun to adapt. And professional associations are spurring the movement. At the American Physical Therapy Association, the Department of Minority and International Affairs has focused on ethnic awareness and education for the last seven years with a spectrum of programs from awareness videos to minority scholarships. The American Podiatric Medical Association has organized COMMIT (Conference On Multicultural Membership Issues and Talent) to foster what one spokesman described as "multicultural discussions."
<P>In a sense, that's really what much of the health care industry will have to be about--discussions that are clearly understood. Bilingual telephone access has become the norm. Within tomorrow's healthcare landscape, there will be little tolerance for miscommunication.
<P>True to the demographic buck, some managed care analysts now suspect that treating foreign-born citizens may yield a capitated dividend. Hispanic immigrants, for example, tend to be younger than the American-born population as a whole and studies show they appear to have substantially lower rates of death from expensive illnesses such as heart disease and cancer. And while they do have higher rates of certain types of diabetes, there is hope for improvement in areas like education and preventative care.

<H2>Guinea worm eradicated</H2>
Guinea Worm Disease, the dreaded parasitic condition affecting so many villagers in Ghana, finally appears to have been eradicated. Those infected by the painful disease Dracunculiasis literally serve as hosts during the Guinea Worm's reproductive cycle--during which time the female Guinea worm can grow to three feet in length. At full maturity, these worms make their way to the skin's surface, primarily in the lower limbs, where they then pierce the skin in an attempt to depart the host.
<P>A friend of <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> who has since left the Peace Corps recalled her recent work in Ghana, where all waking hours were spent purifying drinking water. As a result of a collective international effort to defeat the horrific malady, health officials from around the world say that the remaining 100,000 cases will be the last. This footnote: this is the second time in recent memory health officials felt confident enough to say that the Guinea Worm had been destroyed.

<H2>Comfort update</H2>
The line between fashion and comfort continues to blur. Indeed, the Fashion Footwear Association of New York (FFANY) indicates a trend toward more comfort-oriented shoes. Says one FFANY analyst, "We're still the Fashion Footwear Association, but... we have more new members categorized as comfort vendors."

<H2>Talk more, test less</H2>
Talk, talk, talk. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in mid-December called on doctors and nurses to spend more time chatting with their patients and less time conducting diagnostic tests. The independent panel, convened under the auspices of the U.S. Public Health Service, issued a revision to its 1989 guidelines governing disease prevention and health promotion questioning the benefits of nearly 200 screening tests, vaccines, and medical devices used to prevent or monitor disease. 
<P>Among its findings, the panel rejected the now common emphasis on standardized annual physical exams. Instead, the group urged practitioners to tailor routine check ups to individual patients based on such factors as age, health risks, and patient preference.
<P>Calling many of the practices costly, ineffective and, in some cases, "dangerous," Task force Chairman Harold C. Sox, Jr., MD, Chairman of Medicine at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, declared, "All too often, the evidence was too weak for us to make a strong recommendation."

<H2>Kris Kringle's chiropractor</H2>
The Maryland State Lottery ran a television ad featuring, of all people, Santa Claus's chiropractor. Encouraging Marylanders to take it easy on Santa, the lottery urged holiday shoppers to give a lightweight gift such as--you guessed it--scratch-off game cards. The portrayed chiropractor was one Wayne Federman, D.C. Wayne, are you out there, or just a figment of Santa's imagination?

<H2>The scoop on scanners</H2>
Despite a lot of vaporous talk during the past eight years, there are currently only two laser or optical foot scanners available: Benefoot's ScanCast and the Bergmann Optical Scanner. Others, such as ADT, which cautiously suggests its scanner will hit the market by next summer, are years overdue. Engineer Alex Shang, PhD, who now supports several labs, is said to be readying a low-end SharpShape foot scanner, although some fear he lacks the marketing resources this type of technology needs to fuel proliferation and success.
<P>As it stands today, Bergmann's high-end scanner based on Cyberware hardware and Bergmann's own software is the oldest and most battle tested laser scanning device in use. Some 28 Bergman scanners are up and running in an array of sites ranging from private school offices to an Air Force clinic. However, Benefoot's ScanCast is the fastest selling scanner. By late January, after less than a year in the marketplace, ScanCast installations will probably equal Bergmann's. Bergmann's scanner sells for roughly $12,000, while Benefoot's lists for about half that price. Not to be outdone, Bergmann promises to launch a new and smaller $7,800 model in early 1996. 

<H2>Errata</H2>
<UL><LI>The SATRA Footwear Technology Center--cited in the November/ December 1995 Comfort Shoes article--is actually located in Kettering, Northamptonshire, England, and not outside of London as indicated.</UL> 
<UL><LI>Due to a typo, an article on desktop millers in the November-December issue cited miller accuracy rates of within .500 of an inch. The actual rate of accuracy is approximately .005 of an inch.</UL>
<UL><LI>An October article on winter/vacation medical seminars "outside North America" that might trigger a tax audit included references to Bermuda based upon information provided by the IRS. Following publication of the article, <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> found a tax code citation, L-1744 in Federal Tax Coordinator 2nd, that specifically includes Bermuda as part of North America by virtue of a treaty, and therefore not subject to IRS automatic audit guidelines. Moreover, shortly after the article appeared, the IRS announced it was discontinuing the majority of its automatic and random audits. Hence, practitioner seminars in Bermuda will not trigger automatic audits.

<H1>Your Practice and the Web</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
Few people seem to really understand the so-called Information Superhighway, the Internet, and the World Wide Web that everyone is so fascinated with. 
<P>But then again, many people do not understand the elaborate connections that make up the worldwide telephone system or America's broadcast and cable television system. Yet both of these well-established communications networks are now taken for granted. Both have unmistakably shaken and shaped our nation and your practice. It will be the same for the Internet and the World Wide Web. Soon, the computer revolution will pull virtually everyone from the Automation Age into the Information Age. Whether you come kicking and screaming, or rush to get there before the next guy, will depend in large part on your sense of fear, fascination, and most importantly, your sense of the future.

<H2><IMG SRC="/graphics/www4.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32">The Internet and World Wide Web Made Real Real Simple</H2>
What follows is an explanation of the Internet and the World Wide Web that is so simple even I could understand it before I became the editor of a computer magazine. 
<P>No one source owns or controls the Internet. It is a tangled network of massive and minuscule global interconnections anyone can access. Compare your computer to the automobile in your garage and the Internet to a road system. You have your own driveway that leads to a local street, that connects to a county road, that connects to a state highway that accesses regional and interstate expressways. Your automobile can take you to any destination in the United States by any combination of highways or streets, public or private, direct or circuitous. You can even take shortcuts by driving off the road. Starting at the same private driveway, you can drive across U.S. borders to the furthest reaches of North or South America. If you are so inclined, you can ship your car across the Atlantic and drive through Europe and Asia. That's the Internet--a jumble of interconnecting information thoroughfares. 
<P>The only difference between the car you drive and the E-mail you send is that when you drive your automobile from Syracuse to San Diego, for example, you carefully select the route. Your E-mail, on the other hand, speeds along a serpentine route so circuitous--some of it involving switching satellites in outer space--it can't be predicted and, in many cases, can't even be traced. Those tapping into Internet discussion groups and information sites are taking an equally tortuous route that only a computer can calculate. Hence, the term cyberspace. Because this global network is generally accessed with a mere local phone call, it seems magical for a user in Des Moines to spend an hour surfing European Net sites. All you need is a computer, a modem, the right software, and an online service such as America Online, Prodigy, or CompuServe. Tapping into that Information Superhighway can instantly take you virtually anywhere, no matter where you start.
<P>The World Wide Web is the most graphical and interactive portion of the Internet. It also gives you access to the non-graphical and sometimes arcane sites including newsgroups. Accessing these sites is, again, as simple as a local phone call. But Web access requires a very fast modem (28.8Kbps recommended), and special Web browsing software, such as OS/2's Web Explorer or Netscape's Navigator configured for Windows, UNIX, or the Macintosh. When you access a Website it's like standing before a computerized  information and entertainment kiosk. By clicking on certain buttons and navigating up and down the pages, you see lots of pretty pictures, and work through menus yielding varying layers of options, information, and entertainment.
<P>Even more fascinating is the extraordinary and magical interconnectivity of all Websites. Links on every Website can be clicked to immediately transport you to any other linked Website. For example, when you're at the <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> Website, you can click a button or two and be immediately transported to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons' home page, the O &#38; P Network Connection, CNN's home page, the Internal Revenue Service, or the home page of Bloch Orthotics Lab. Remember, these home pages belong to other entities and are remotely and independently controlled by their own computers. But <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> has chosen to make automatic links available-virtual off-ramps, if you will. These other Websites are also linked with many others, creating a constellation of linked Websites. Many sites show the Webmaster's personality by linking to special unrelated interests. For example, Stephen Pribut, DPM, Washington, D.C., podiatrist, who operates what is probably the snazziest Biomechanics Website in the nation [www.clark.net/pub/pribut/sppages. html], has numerous links to chess pages because--I guess--he likes chess. 
<P>Dr. Pribut's home page, the O &#38; P Network Connection, and scores of other sites also link directly to the <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> Website. That brings up a fascinating fact. Millions of people are now cruising the Web. Every week, millions more join. Everyone and their uncle is creating a home page with the speed of people buying VCRs. Home page growth is so fast and so frenetic that right now the World Wide Web is a confusing jungle. Website addresses often are impossible to remember. Not everyone has a snappy address such as www.toyota.com or www.aaos.org. The <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> address is not so easy to remember either: http://www.ifi-mpls.com/biomech. The "www" stands for World Wide Web. The "ifi" stands for International Features Inc. and the "mpls" is for Minneapolis. We're in the process now of acquiring shorter names for all our pages, such as www.biomech.com and www.stridemag.com. But the World Wide Web is mushrooming so fast that the cooperative naming committees which assign Web addresses sometimes take months to answer inquiries. And, if their answer is "unavailable" you must start the whole process all over again.
<H2><IMG SRC="/graphics/onramp2.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32">Gateways, Pitfalls, and Time Outs</H2>
You can get around long, impossible to remember addresses by starting at a convenient gateway, or simply adding a favorite Website to your Web browser's memorized links. That's part of what makes Web gateways such as the <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> Website and CyberPark [http://www.cyberpark-mall.com] so important. They are easy "starting places" with loads of links. From a gateway, you can launch anywhere. That's because a good gateway also links to Web search engines such as Yahoo, WebCrawler, and Lycos. By clicking onto these search and indexing services, you can literally type in a word and find all the mentions everywhere and anywhere in the Web, subject to constant updating. Hence, you could type in the word "arthritis" or "plantar fasciitis" and see a list of documents containing those words. Click on one of those listings, and you're transported to that page. 
<P>There are some pitfalls here, all relating to time and productivity. First, the references you find in your search can be so numerous that you need screening mechanisms, such as a friendly gateway. If you enter the word "horse," you would find thousands of references. But if you start at an equestrian gateway, someone has already provided a fixed set of links that are of interest to a horse lover. It's the same with biomechanical matters. Otherwise, you can end up wasting a lot of time weeding out the choices.
<P>Second, although many sites are listed, many are abandoned, too weak to support real traffic, never completed, or under very preliminary construction. It's common for a medical student at a college or university to create a health industry Website, but then walk away. Or, the Website may not be supported by industrial strength computers capable of handling numerous accessing users. A good site operated by a weak computer will quickly crash if too many people access it at the same time. Unguided exploration again means time wasted waiting for broken, crashed, or nonexistent sites to appear on the screen.
<P>Third, many sites are simply too pretty. That means they're too slow. One of the great paradoxes of the Web is that it has to be graphical and pretty. But the prettier and more graphical it is, the slower and less useful it becomes. Podnet, a very useful British podiatry Website [http://www.ucl.uk/%7Ezcgbasr/podnet.htm] is so loaded down with graphics, it can take several minutes to download a single page, let alone successfully surf through its layered menus. Many computers, especially those with slower modems, will simply time out and abort the effort after the time limit established by your computer has expired. Again, that's wasted time. The most successful Websites are those that convey graphic quality using minimal graphics. 
<P>Reliable gateways can help you narrow your sights, access only working and useful home pages, and create a community of interlinked sites. But no gateway can make a slow site speed up. Hence, even if you access the <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> gateway, if you link to Podnet, it will take time. Fortunately, if you need the information the slower site offers, it's worth it.
<P>Now that you have an idea of how the Web works its magic, let's see how that wizardry can and should change your practice. There are scores of ways, but it all boils down to shades of personal and professional productivity. Remember, all that we describe below is going to happen or is already happening.

<H2><IMG SRC="/graphics/doc03.gif" WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="32">Research and Information</H2>
When you need instant access to an article or a topic, chances are you'll be able to find it on the Web. Many clinical journals now post their contents on the Web, and some are even scrambling to post back issues. Moreover, you will now have instant access to obscure or little circulated but nonetheless important journals and medical resources published by universities, hospitals, research organizations, associations, and governments. For example, I just typed in "diabetes" via the WebCrawler search engine and within a few seconds found nearly 900 clinical and consumer resources from a gamut of sources from the American Diabetes Association's Oregon Affiliate to the Glenwood Regional Hospital in Northern Louisiana. Several comprehensive bibliographies of printed materials also appeared. I clicked on the Glenwood Hospital option and saw a consumer oriented page chock-filled with statistics. I hit one key and a moment later the page rolled off my laser printer. Within a few moments I had completed a research task that in the past might have consumed hours of phone and library work. 
<P>Other search engines can help tailor your choices. For example, Lycos finds more than 4,000 documents with "diabetes" or its near derivatives, but narrows the selection to 28 by scoring how well a page matches your request. Thus, a page that mentions diabetes early in the document (such as the title) would receive a higher score than a document with a reference toward the end of the article. If I type "diabetic foot," Lycos matches more than 37,000 documents, including those that match only one term, but listing documents that match both terms. Thus Lycos gives you a better feel for the contents than WebCrawler (which lists only the document title).
<H2>Rules and Regulations</H2>
Access state and government regulations any time you please by clicking on the home pages of various federal entities from OSHA to the EPA. Fedworld [http://www.fedworld.gov/] makes it easy. Or use a search word. <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> links right to HHS, which maintains home pages for most of its agencies--from the FDA to HCFA. (Warning: HHS home pages are loaded with graphics and can take a little longer to appear.) Once at HCFA you can study proposed regulations, final regulations, and even download zipped documents in WordPerfect.

<H2><IMG SRC="/graphics/talker.gif" WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="32">Communicate with Colleagues and the World</H2>
Direct Internet access allows you to enjoy desktop E-mail. By using the right software and an Internet connection, your mail can pop right up on your screen. You can be connected to anyone anywhere instantaneously and reply instantaneously. No more wasting several minutes hanging on the phone, wading through secretaries and medical assistants to deliver a short epigrammatic message. Just send a short note: "I'll be late for the meeting. Is 4:30 OK?"
<P>Since you can create aliases (multiple addresses that go different places), you can maintain several addresses within your network server. For example, Dr. Jones can maintain askjones@doctor.com for patients which is routed to the physician's assistant. The local medical society and close friends and colleagues can contact Dr. Jones directly at his desktop--at drjones@doctor.com.

<H2>Expand Association Activity</H2>
You can become more active in your own local, state, or national associations by accessing their Web pages, joining discussions, posting messages, and encouraging others to communicate with you. Learn about upcoming meetings, send a message to the executive director, click onto benefit descriptions. And of course, tap into other associations' Web pages to see how they do things. The <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> Website will link to as many major and minor professional associations as possible as they come on line. Not all professional Websites should be public, however. A group of physical therapists, for example, may choose to organize a job exchange. Perhaps all the orthopedists in a town decide to customize a Website for their closed collective use. The point is, the Web allows people to come together.

<H2>Multi-Office Management</H2>
If you have several offices, sharing information resources on the Internet could deliver a major productivity boost. A shared scheduler accessible on the Internet, desktop E-mail, Wide Area Network databases, shared office information and patient charts--all this and more is possible when your networks are linked on the Internet. You can also make private Websites accessible only to your offices by routing them through the office servers you control. For example, all patient information and special news and medical journal links could be a click away if your offices create and maintain their own closed Website. Indeed, using low cost closed-circuit TV, you can even monitor procedures and waiting rooms at your other locations via your private Website.
<P>The risk here is security, and it's not a small risk. The Internet is like a house with locks and burglar alarms on all the doors and windows, but gaping holes in the roof and walls. That's why serious encryption must be part of any secure Website where data and messages are exchanged, especially data as sensitive as patient information. <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> links its offices in Minnesota, Washington D.C., and New York via closed Internet vehicles, but all our exchanges are encrypted. 

<H2>Electronic Commerce</H2>
Your practice must shop like any other business. And in addition your practice often mixes its commercial needs with medical exploration. You can now access competitive price and medical efficacy information by clicking on vendor sites, either directly or though various gateways. <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> currently operates the most extensive network of on-site information and off-site links for the biomechanics mainstream. The <CITE>BioMechanics Desk Reference</CITE> has been placed on the Web and can be accessed as easily as the book itself. Our Mall has information and links for scores of vendors. When you click onto Benefoot's listing, for example, you will ultimately be able to peruse the company's entire catalog, delve deep into spec sheets, and even study online tutorials for Benefoot's ScanCast office-based foot scanner. You could spend just a few minutes on line and determine which lab offers a discount women's dress shoe device made of Poron and send messages to those labs requesting samples. New products, from electrotherapy to hip braces, can be reviewed at your leisure without the pressure of a detail man standing over you. It's all continuously under construction--a term you see on the Web. Eventually, the Web may replace hardcopy publications as your first search option when shopping.

<H2><IMG SRC="/graphics/sound02.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="29">Advertise Your Practice</H2>
Most practitioners realize the benefits of advertising their practice, through the Yellow Pages, community newspapers, patient newsletters, descriptive brochures, health tips, and more. All that exposure is possible at a fraction of the cost with your own home page. Yet, the process of creating a home page can be daunting. While the tools for creating the pages have become simpler (such as using your word processor to create Web pages), you must still manage the Web server and links. If you plan to do it yourself, start simple with text and just a few pictures. If you haven't the time or inclination, consider hiring a service bureau to create and manage the pages for you.
<P>Once you've decided to create a home page, you have to think about what information to include. Let's create an imaginary New Jersey Central Foot and Ankle Specialists, a multidisciplinary practice specializing in sports medicine and diabetes. Put it together like you would a color brochure. Start with photos of the practitioners, their professional backgrounds, areas of expertise, their office addresses and hours. Then go for it: reimbursement plans, directions from anywhere in the city, a special taxi service for those unable to drive, your emergency phone numbers, awards and commendations, reprints of any articles about the practitioners. Don't stop there. Offer tips on therapeutic shoe reimbursement, skiing injuries, women's health.
<P>There is no limit to how diverse and valuable a resource your home page can be, as Dr. Pribut has proved. His home page offers scores of health backgrounders on everything from walking to sports injuries. His site links to dozens of running club home pages, the local weather, numerous publications from Stride and <CITE>BioMechanics Magazines</CITE> to the <CITE>British Medical Journal</CITE> and the <CITE>Peak Performance Newsletter</CITE>.

<H2><IMG SRC="/graphics/docbag1.gif" WIDTH="38" HEIGHT="32">Virtual Practice</H2>
The most revolutionary aspect of getting your practice on the Web is virtual practice. No, I'm not talking about treating people on the Web. Not exactly--but I am talking about simplifying many aspects of practice and even treatment. For example, prospective patients could fill out their medical history on a Web site that feeds straight into your databases. Why not post a public scheduler that allows people to ask for an open date and then get one subject to confirmation: give me the first lunch appointment next week, or any Tuesday at 8 am? Airlines are experimenting with this now. Many companies already maintain such schedules and a prototype was jointly demonstrated by IBM and <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> at the Midwest Podiatry Conference last year.
<P>Yes, you treat people in the office, but why not undertake simple follow-up via the Web? Patients could answer questions about their pain wherever and whenever: it's gone, it's still there, now the knee is inflamed. Answer at your leisure. Rewrite the rules on use of your time.
<P>Web medicine could solve geographic problems that were previously tackled with travelling circuits, satellite offices, and even bush pilots. If you're practicing in spread out areas, such as Wyoming or Utah, or underserved regions such as the South Side of Chicago, Web contact could make all the difference. Indeed, why not create telemedical sites complete with two-way video when special outreach is needed. Some candidates are nursing homes, Indian reservations, poverty stricken locales, or even the basement of major innovative healthcare employers such as Xerox and Kodak that can't afford for employees to take a half day off to see a doctor for a routine question that might take only 10 minutes. The prospects are mind boggling. This is a bold new operating room and the legal and ethical ramifications will have to be sorted out. It won't be easy. 
<P>Of course, practitioners will have to rewrite compensation procedures as well, so that they can engage in a 10-minute video segment or even a five-minute Internet exchange and receive proper fees. In the not so distant future, more of that fee will support real healthcare delivery, and less will go to infrastructure. Yes, the technology to run such a system will also cost money, and must be maintained, but it's nothing compared to the cost of an office infrastructure.
<P>Sooner or later, your practice will be on the Web. That's because your patients are already there, new computer savvy practitioners are there, and business is migrating there as fast as, and even faster than is prudently possible. Trust me. It's coming. It's here. Step lively, and you're a step ahead. But step carefully. The Information Superhighway is populated with profitable destinations and fascinating byways. However, en route, you will encounter potholes, washed out lanes, and even a few highwaymen. Progress has its price. But I believe the Web, if approached cautiously, can yield a terrific bargain.

<P>Nearly all practitioners have computer systems in their office. But many do not operate the computers themselves. There are all sorts of surrogates: office managers, secretaries, assistants, the business partner. But this has to end if you are to join the 21st Century, which is sneaking up quickly. If you haven't learned to be comfortable with your computer, this may be a good time to start. 
<P>Exploiting your computer means more than just practice management and patient billing. There's a galaxy of personal and professional opportunities you can tap into with the use of your computer, once you understand how it works and how it can extend your reach. Connecting to the World Wide Web is just one example, but a very powerful one. By now you have heard everyone from your nephew to the evening newscaster extolling the virtues of the Web. Our cover story helps you understand and exploit the Information Superhighway in ways that will put your practice on the cutting edge.
<P>To help you in your travels, we have constructed the BioMechanics Gateway, a friendly starting place that can take you just about anywhere you need to go. Our address is www.ifi-mpls.com/biomech. Save it to your software dialer or address book. 
<P>Elsewhere in this issue, James Taillon, CO and Diane Taillon, OTR, CO, add another perspective to the ongoing debate on pediatric foot bracing in their article <CITE>Keys to Lower Extremity Pediatric Bracing</CITE>. This controversial subject has been one of the most difficult for <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> to address. Readers will note that in past issues we have run articles by a podiatrist and an orthopedic surgeon, finding no common ground on the basics of treatment. To get a third opinion, we sought out two leading orthotists--practitioners who actually fabricate and customize pediatric braces for the lower extremity. The article appears on page 21.
<P>Continuing to delve into controversy, we point you to an article sure to provoke lots of disagreement. On page 41, Donald Baxter, MD, and his colleagues define what is for them the "ideal running orthosis." This one can be argued forever. So enjoy the essay.
<P><CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> prides itself on having the gumption to air the debates of the day, whether it's EPF, pediatric bracing, or how your computer will shape your practice. That's what we're all about. We encourage your letters and run as many as possible from as diverse a group as we can. If you are planning to pick up a paper and pen, see my comments in the Contact section about a few letters this magazine unfortunately ran in January. 
<P>For those of you who are still pouring over our <CITE>BioMechanics Desk Reference</CITE>, an Errata section will run in the April issue. Later this year, <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> is planning six special circulation editions to create in-depth reports on such subjects as the Paralympics, managed care, and practice in the next century. 
<P>As for <CITE>Stride Magazine</CITE>, it's going great guns. Some 300,000 subscription cards have been stuffed into shoeboxes, insole packets, and orthotic kits by several dozen companies--from Soft Spots to Spenco. Patients and consumers across America are talking to us about their new appreciation for lower extremity biomechanics. <CITE>Stride's</CITE> second issue will be out this spring, and we're adding a special edition for shoe manufacturers this fall to address the subject of comfort shoes. 
<P>See you at the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons' annual meeting in New Orleans, and the American Academy of Orthotics and Prosthetics convention in Orlando. We'll be there. <B>--Edwin Black</B>

<H1>Keys to Lower Extremity Pediatric Bracing</H1>
<P><I>by James Taillon, CO, and Diane Taillon, OTR, CO</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
Patient size isn't the only difference between adults and children undergoing orthotic treatment. A child's age and rapid growth often make it difficult to assess the severity of a perceived problem and are important factors in determining whether a problem should in fact be corrected with orthoses and when treatment should begin. 
<P>When providing effective treatment for children, keep in mind the three A's: accurate fit, age appropriate design, and biomechanical alignment. Ignoring any of these will limit the efficacy of pediatric bracing or cause it to fail completely. Brace design is based on clinical presentation and clinical assessment. As such, medically differing diagnoses can be treated with similar braces if the biomechanical assessment reveals similar alignment needs.
<H2>Accuracy</H2>
Accuracy of fit is required to provide effective, tolerable pressures. Active growth in the pediatric patient requires frequent follow-up visits for adjustments and possible replacement. When molded plastic devices are used, re-contouring the plastic will accommodate growth changes. Linear growth is normally the principle factor for determining when replacement is necessary. Since accuracy of fit demands intimate contact, braces that are poorly molded, stuffed with soft pads, or made too large to accommodate growth will not work. 
<P>The internal contours of the orthosis must be capable of providing corrective pressures at the appropriate sites without harming soft tissue. When orthoses are evaluated, squared heels (inside the brace) and navicular callusing are indicative of insufficient calcaneal control. The most significant design challenge in AFOs, SMOs, UCBs, and FOs is calcaneal control, followed by forefoot control. If these two parameters are accounted for and if adequate range of motion is available, the brace likely will fit and function well. For example, forefoot abductus secondary to calcaneal eversion requires lateral pressure at the metatarsal head or toe sulcus in addition to calcaneal containment and alignment.
<P>When multiple joints are covered (e.g., KAFOs), the brace is designed to accommodate growth. In most cases this is done via linear adjustment mechanisms such as overlapping uprights, pre-drilled in equal increments. Also in complex systems such as KAFOs or HKAFOs, components can be replaced individually (e.g., a new thigh band or AFO section) in addition to accommodating length changes. As a result, custom bracing is often the most cost effective treatment in complex cases.

<H2>Age Appropriate Design</H2>
Age appropriate treatment deals with the type of orthosis chosen and the alignment required. Part of the decision process related to age is determining whether treatment really is necessary. Often, parents are assured that their child will "grow out of" an abnormality, yet it becomes very difficult for parents when their child becomes the exception rather than the rule. If a child does not spontaneously correct, the practitioner has missed part of a very narrow treatment window.
<P>In cases where there is no question concerning the need for treatment, a practitioner still faces the challenge of deciding when to start. Experience indicates that earlier is better. Maintaining foot and lower extremity alignment in the neurologically impaired child prior to weightbearing allows the child to initiate a pull to standing with his/her feet, knees, and hips in good biomechanical position. As weightbearing progresses and stance stability is acquired, the child progresses to ambulation with a minimum of alignment-induced problems.
<P>A formula designed by Ronald Valmassy, DPM, provides for the determination of calcaneal alignment based on the child's age. His rule of subtracting the child's age from seven creates a guideline for proper hindfoot position, appropriate to the age at start of treatment. Briefly stated, an infant's foot starts with eight degrees of calcaneal eversion, which decreases by one degree per year to zero at age eight. Measuring the calcaneal eversion angle allows the practitioner to determine the effectiveness of his or her treatment over time, or whether treatment is indicated. A six-month-old child with ten degrees of calcaneal eversion looks significantly flatfooted, but is probably not a candidate for orthotic treatment unless other factors are present. A six-year-old with ten degrees of calcaneal eversion and a complaint of pain probably is a good candidate.
<P>The Great Toe Extension Test of G.K. Rose, MD, serves as an additional indicator. If passive extension of the great toe (with the child weightbearing) results in an elevation of the arch and external rotation of the tibia, orthotic treatment is probably not indicated. If neither sign is present and the calcaneal angle indicates, orthotic care is indicated.
<P>The selection of orthoses is age dependent as well. In general, the younger the child, the more stability is required. Solid ankle AFOs used for foot alignment and pulling to stance may require replacement with articulated AFOs or even less restrictive designs such as SMOs or UCBs as the child acquires stability and progresses to ambulation. Often the solid ankle AFO may be modified into an SMO or UCB if the original orthosis was well designed and continues to fit properly. This is a departure from common wisdom of the past when children were left untreated until they had progressed to stance and gait. For neurologically involved patients, this delay in orthotic treatment often meant foot growth was completed and braces were reduced to maintaining a deformed foot.  
<H2>Biomechanical Alignment</H2>
Biomechanical alignment considers the chronological and physiologic age of the child. The lower extremity--particularly the foot--constantly changes in both size and in structure. At age one the foot is one-half its adult length; by age eight inherent foot alignment is 95 to 98 percent complete. Alignment has to consider both internal structure and positional requirements of the entire lower extremity. What may be corrective forces in adult treatment may very well be deforming forces in a child.
<P>While off-the-shelf (OTS) bracing is available from a large number of manufacturers and suppliers, only a few companies specialize in pediatrics. As we interviewed physicians, orthotists, and therapists for this article it became clear that, as far as children's orthoses are concerned, custom bracing is far more dominant than OTS bracing.
<P>However, there definitely is a place for OTS devices. Pavlic harnesses and other positional orthoses for CDH have proven effective. Likewise, the Wheaton Brace is an effective treatment for metatarsus adductus. OTS orthoses are a cost effective alternative when they provide proper alignment, fit, and function. As science advances and as finances dictate, more prefabricated orthoses will become available. It is up to practitioners to utilize the effective orthoses and provide feedback to the manufactures when designs are inappropriate. If they listen, treatment will improve and costs will decrease.

<H1>Current Transtibial Prosthetic Principles</H1>
<P><I>by Kevin Carroll, RP, IRL and John Sabolich, CPO</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
Transtibial surgery is the most common level of major amputation surgery. Persons who use a transtibial prosthesis generally resume their activities of daily living with little difficulty. Among the most common causes of amputation for this group are diabetes and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The majority of this group consists of the older adult population. Among the complaints prosthetic practitioners hear from this group is the prosthesis is too heavy, or the socket is not fitting correctly and is uncomfortable. But better materials, new technology, and a more logical and scientific approach to fitting the socket itself are helping prosthetists to overcome these problems, and helping to move the practice of prosthetics away from the realm of art and into the realm of science.
<P>The issue of weight can be addressed by using lightweight materials, such as composite plastics and newer lightweight componentry now available from companies such as Otto Bock, USMC, Foresee, Hosmer, M+IND, Ohio Willow Wood, and Flex-Foot, to name just a few. 
<P>The question of socket fit is another issue. Fortunately, we are moving into the era of computer aided socket design (CAD), which will provide the prosthetist with a good foundation to start building the prosthesis. Several CAD-CAM systems are available from companies such as Vorum, Biosculptor, M+IND, Clynch Technologies, IPOS, and many more, along with others that are still under development. 
<P>Even diagnosing the socket fit is moving toward a more scientific approach, in that computer analysis can also be achieved by using such systems as the Rincoe diagnostic system (electronic pressure analysis). And yet, with all this new advanced diagnostic equipment, it is still going to take a skillful and experienced prosthetist to ensure an intimate fitting socket, whether it be for upper or lower extremity prosthetics. 

<H2>The Socket Interface</H2>
When dealing with socket fit for persons with transtibial amputations, it is of utmost importance to keep in mind the socket interface. This is the all-important place where "the rubber meets the road," so to speak. An amputee can have the latest advanced materials and components, but if the all-important interface does not conform to the underlying anatomy, then all will be for naught. In a patient who is experiencing all sorts of problems with socket fit, it is not uncommon after a thorough evaluation to discover that the socket fits perfectly and the problem instead stems from the interface materials. 
<P>A good example is Pelite. This material has gained both national and international acceptance in the prosthetic community, and yet it has one of the highest coefficients of friction of any material we now use, compared with polyethylene from American Plastics, Mark Sampson, Daytona Plastics, etc., and bioelastic from USMC, which have low coefficient of friction qualities. If you hold a piece of Pelite at a 45 degree angle and drop a wool sock on the Pelite, the sock will stick to the Pelite. If this simple experiment is tried on polyethylene or bioelastic, the sock would slide right off. Leather is another material with a very low coefficient of friction, which makes it a preferred material for shoes. The friction of Pelite-lined shoes would cause great discomfort. With this in mind, low-friction sockets should be used whenever possible.
<P>How do low-friction interfaces affect the use of suction liners such as the Iceross, Alps, Fillauer, and the TEC-Interface systems? These liners are form-fitting sleeves that are actually rolled up on the residual limb. The liners provide great protection, especially for older adults, who have fragile tissue to begin with. Diabetic patients, who need maximal protection, also benefit from these low-friction interfaces. Moreover, due to the cold flow characteristics of the materials used in these liners, the residual limb is protected from shear forces, thus reducing tissue breakdown. With most of these systems, it is best to apply a prosthetic sock or sheath on the outside of the liner, which reduces friction between the liner and the socket and provides for easy donning of the prosthesis. If the interface of the prosthesis has low friction characteristics, the patient's residual limb will be protected from abrasions.
<H2>Suspension</H2>
Suspension is another important factor for persons with transtibial amputations. Poor suspension gives the patient the illusion of having a heavy prosthesis, and this leads to premature fatigue. Also, inadequate suspension leads to frictional rubbing at the patient-socket interface. The beauty of most of the suction liners is the utilization of a pin that protrudes through the end of the liner, which in turn fits into a shuttle-lock built into the prosthesis. This allows the patient to have a great deal of control over the prosthesis. There are also several different suspension sleeves made by companies such as Alps and MICA, along with many others that often give the patient a feeling of having a suction socket on the residual limb, and again allows the user greater positive control over the prosthesis. There are numerous other ways of suspending the transtibial prosthesis, including the use of straps and harnesses, supracondylar, and thigh corsets. These usually are not desirable, but sometimes are necessary, especially on extremely short or unstable residual limbs.
<H2>Component Selection</H2>
Component selection is very important when designing a transtibial prosthesis, especially when dealing with the older adult population. It usually is desirable to use an alignable system, which allows for adjustment to the alignment after completion--such as in reducing a flexion contracture or changing the overall length as the amputee becomes more experienced.
<H2>Foot Selection</H2>
The selection of a foot is an important process, too. Never before has there been such an array of prosthetic feet from which to choose. Briefly, one must first decide what function a foot can provide the patient. Does the patient require an energy-storing foot, or a foot that dissipates energy? Or, since the time on the heel during the normal gait is reduced in these patients, is it necessary to fit a single axis foot that allows for accelerated plantar flexion at heel strike, providing almost instantaneous medial-lateral stability? The single axis foot has lost popularity over the years due to weight and extra maintenance. However, with the development of lighter weight ankle joints, its popularity is beginning to rise again.
<H2>Cosmetic Considerations</H2>
Cosmesis can be a great help when encouraging patients to accept the prosthesis. A close resemblance to their own limb helps them with self-esteem issues and allows them to feel better about themselves. Several cosmeses can be applied, such as hard laminated materials or soft skin-like textures. Many practitioners prefer applying skin materials such as "New Skin" to the outer soft cosmetic covering. However, this is not a routine laboratory procedure. It is difficult to apply and requires skill and artistic ability to obtain the desired result. When we think about Michelangelo, we realize that it was the artist's special ability that created the beautiful paintings in the Sistine Chapel, not the actual paint used on the ceiling. Paint was just the medium.
<P>Persons with transtibial amputations fortunately can take advantage of a new era of technology. With bone-and-muscle-contoured, total surface bearing, and flexible socket interfaces, patients cannot tell where the interface of soft material ends and the rigidity of the exterior socket frame begins. 
<P>In striving to help make life a little better for our patients we must work as a multidisciplinary team in choosing socket interfaces and componentry, and in setting appropriate goals for the patients. The ultimate beneficiary, of course, is the patient.

<H1>The Ideal Running Orthosis</H1> 
<BR><H2><I>A Philosophy of Design</I></H2>
<P><I>by Donald E. Baxter, MD; David A. Porter, MD, PhD; Paul Flahavan, C.Ped; and Charles May</I>
</CENTER>
<HR>
The Ideal Orthosis. Now there's a mouthful. Is there  such a thing as an "Ideal Foot Orthosis" for runners? Can one orthosis meet all the foot needs of all people? Of course not. Is there an orthosis that is so ideal that one should wear it to prevent foot problems? Of course not. Is there one orthosis that meets all the needs of both the rigid and flexible foot? Of course not. However, is there an Ideal Orthosis for each individual with a pathologic foot disorder requiring orthotic management? We say yes.
<P>The Ideal Orthosis should be adaptable with a custom fit for comfort and a semirigid or flexible construct. It should be lightweight and inexpensive with a covering to decrease shear but give control to both the forefoot and hindfoot. The Ideal Orthosis should be durable and transferable to most shoes. It should have the ability to maintain memory in its shape and be adjustable for later modifications.
<P>Currently, there are two broad categories of orthosis design within orthotic management: corrective and accommodative orthosis. A corrective orthosis attempts to place the foot in a corrected position so that over time the abnormal anatomy of the foot will "mold" to the corrected position. A rigid orthosis is required for this type of correction. An accommodative orthosis attempts to change the stress pattern of the foot by relieving areas of high stress or by positioning the foot to allow it to absorb stress in a more physiologic manner. This kind of correction generally requires a softer orthosis. But we use accommodative orthoses almost exclusively in a semirigid construct according to the following principles.

<P><B>Adaptability.</B> Although we construct our orthoses from custom molds, the orthosis often needs to be modified to meet additional requirements. Particularly when a pronated foot undergoes corrective surgery, the Ideal Orthosis should allow easy alteration from the pre-operative to post-operative fit. A semirigid design easily lends itself to such modifications and adaptations.

<P><B>Custom Fit and Comfort.</B> In many instances we use off-the-shelf shoe inserts such as metatarsal pads for intractable plantar keratosis (IPK) or non-operative treatment of interdigital neuromas. However, for the Ideal Orthosis, maximal comfort and control are obtained by fabricating the orthosis from a cast of the foot in the weightbearing position using primarily impression foam as the casting medium. Bony prominence relief, metatarsal lifts, and posting can then be built into this custom fit.

<P><B>Semirigid or Flexible Construction.</B> As mentioned, we favor and prescribe semirigid orthoses almost exclusively. This allows accommodation of the running or playing surface to the pathologic foot for maximal comfort while controlling the rate of maximal velocity of pronation (Cavanaugh, 1988) or giving relief to over-stressed areas of the foot (metatarsal heads, sesamoids, etc.). Some believe strongly in the use of rigid orthoses (typically hard plastic) constructed from a cast with the hindfoot in a neutral subtalar position. We believe the "neutral" or "corrected" subtalar position is ill-defined and not physiologically reproducible. Futhermore, the subtalar joint ranges through nearly 40 degrees of motion during running and we can't determine which of these 40 degrees is the "correct" position for each athlete. Placing the foot in the functional weightbearing position as the starting point for constructing your Ideal Orthosis seems to make physiologic sense and customizes the subtalar position for each athlete. During construction of the orthosis, attention is also paid to the position of the forefoot. Posting is added for forefoot varus or valgus. 
<P>Forefoot posting aids in hindfoot control such as in the Cavus foot with forefoot valgus and compensatory hindfoot varus. Lateral forefoot posting in this instance helps control the hindfoot varus. Small amounts of hindfoot and forefoot correction position the subtalar joint at its own neutral position at heel strike to allow as much inversion or eversion as possible in the individual athlete.

<P><B>Lightweight.</B> The need for the Ideal Orthosis to be lightweight seems obvious, but depending on the material used, the orthosis can weigh between 35 and 200 grams. Studies have found that the energy cost of running can be increased by as much as 1.7 percent to 1.9 percent with the addition of 200 grams of shoe mass. For the elite athlete we often recommend using an orthosis during training to reduce the risk of injury and stress reaction, but to compete without the orthosis because of the increased energy demand. For the noncompetitive athlete, the small increase in energy demand may be far outweighed by the comfort of the orthosis.

<P><B>Inexpensive.</B> The least expensive orthotic management involves off-the-shelf inserts which are often all that is required for the minimally pathologic foot such as mild IPKs or mild overpronation. However, for the Ideal Orthosis, customizing the insert adds expense. This expense need not, however, be excessive. Our average orthotic cost in the last year was $275. Orthoses in the $400-500 range seem exorbitant in most instances.

<P><B>Shear Control.</B> Shear control and prevention has often been a neglected area in orthotic management. We believe reducing shear is an important component of the Ideal Orthosis, especially when treating sesamoiditis, hyperkeratosis, or athletes with restricted hip or ankle rotation. We accomplish this by applying a soft stretch nylon covered polyurethane foam or microshell rubber over the semirigid construct.

<P><B>Forefoot and Hindfoot Control.</B> A great deal of attention has centered on whether an orthosis can control motion of the foot. Kinematic studies have centered on the hindfoot. Cavanaugh (1978) and Smith (1986) both have demonstrated a small reduction in maximal pronation (10 percent or less) with a 20-70 percent reduction in maximal velocity of pronation. This reduction in the maximal velocity of pronation may be the key biomechanical alteration that orthotic management gives to result in a 60-70 percent satisfaction rate from patients who wear them.

<P><B>Transferability.</B> Anyone dealing with athletes knows that each performer has numerous pairs of shoes depending on the surface and type of competition. To minimize expense and maximize continuity of the orthotic management, the insert must be transferable from competitive shoe to training shoe to walking shoe.

<P><B>Durability and Resiliency.</B> Not only must the Ideal Orthosis be inexpensive, lightweight and be able to control the forefoot and hindfoot, it also must maintain its shape after repeated use (resiliency) and stand up to repeated high compression and shear loads under elite athletic use (durability). Our experience with semirigid orthoses is that they provide good shock absorption and foot control for 1-2 years and then may need to be replaced. Although rigid orthoses have higher durability and resiliency, they cause too much discomfort for many patients who can't seem to tolerate them because of pressure under the bony prominence. Indeed, rigid orthoses can lead to increased stress reaction in the foot and lower extremity because of poor shock absorbency.

<P><B>Characteristics to Avoid.</B> We have elaborated on several characteristics we have found to be essential in the Ideal Orthosis. We would be remiss if we did not also advise <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> readers to avoid a few factors. An orthosis can be too rigid and this must be avoided. Regardless of the position in which the orthosis places the foot ("correct" or not), if the orthosis is uncomfortable it will not be worn. Here, compliance is a dominant issue. Also, one should avoid trying to overcorrect the foot. For instance, overcorrecting the pronated foot can result in stress fractures of the 5th metatarsal or sinus tarsi syndrome. Another common problem is leaving the orthosis at the forefoot level with a sharp edge that can dig into metatarsal heads. If the orthosis doesn't reach the end of the shoe, one should place a comfortable liner over the orthosis that extends to the tips of the toes. 
<P>Another question that often arises is, should the athlete wear an orthosis to prevent a foot or ankle problem from arising? That is, should a runner wear a prophylactic insert? Our recommendation for these athletes is to wear a well constructed athletic shoe with a good arch support.
<P>Following the above guidelines, we have had excellent success with orthotic management in numerous elite and recreational athletes. Our experience with patient satisfaction has been from 64 to an astonishing 96 percent, which is on the higher side of that quoted from patient surveys in the literature. 
<P>So listen closely to your patients, establish their needs, understand their biomechanics, and see for yourself if our Ideal Orthosis can be a wonderful therapeutic intervention for your athletes.

<H1>Global Orthoses</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
</CENTER>
<P>The market for custom foot orthoses has gone global thanks to automated CAD-CAM fabrication, scanning techniques that can convert images of casts and feet into digital messages, and modems and computers that can link the planet. It is now possible for American orthotic labs to place scanners and digitizers anywhere on Earth, instantly transmit the information back to America, and quickly ship a fabricated orthosis. The reach of American foot orthosis technology now spans the oceans. 
<P>ADT's network of custom labs (many of which were microlabs before they automated), includes one in Northern Ireland. Benefoot is placing scanners in Korea and England. Amfit has contact digitizers all over Israel and the Orient. America's scanners on foreign soil means foreign practitioners with modems are as close as around the corner. It also means that American notions of custom foot orthoses are creating a world standard and an economic reality in what is increasingly a global medical marketplace. 
<P>But America is not the only contender. It's a two-way street. Just as Japanese cars are competing in the US market, just as European phone companies are offering long distance service in North America, so are labs from Australia, Germany, and other nations setting up shop to tap the American market.
<P>An Israeli company, Compusole, sells computer-generated insoles in Israel, South Africa, Belgium, and now here in the United States. The device is created from a mere two-dimensional image captured from a flat measuring platform, and the company is good enough to not call its product an orthosis, stressing the term "comfort insole." They avoid the word corrective. The foot's image is captured on a pressure mat, then modemed back to an Israeli lab for fabrication.
<P>At the recent Pedorthic Footwear Association annual meeting in Boston, Compusole Vice President of Marketing Michael Dror assured that the company knows the different between orthoses and insoles and makes no medical claims for its product. "It's just for comfort," he said. Although occasionally, when the product is used by a licensed practitioner, Compusole will use the term "compensating insole." Compusole's output is currently about 5,000 pairs per month worldwide as they proliferate their units in doctor's offices, shoes stores, and anywhere you'll find feet. Indeed, demand has so substantially exceeded supply, Compusole is opening a third lab in New Jersey, not so much to service the American market but to meet global demand. When they do, it will be no different than Honda opening a factory in Ohio or Ford operating a plant in Latin America. It will be multinational business.
<P>Dror sees the global market as very receptive to technology. Just two years ago, Compusole operated solely in Israel, manufacturing orthoses and lower back and knee braces for the Israeli army. The twist--and perhaps key to Compusole's success in the global market--is that in an effort to expand its market, Compusole began looking toward the healthy population as consumers for custom orthoses. "I see people getting better educated," says Dror. "As more people become aware of their feet, the market expands and the products offered get better. This translates into preventative care." 
<P>Amfit's president Tony Tadin adds that American foot health practitioners are still practicing plaster craft and are resisting the adoption of scanning technology. "It's cheap," he says, "so why should they bother to make the transition to scanning technology? It costs money and there's a learning curve involved." But overseas, new technology, such as foot and cast scanning, excites the market. 
<P>One key factor in any foreign market, says Tadin, is the national knowledge of foot health. Tadin says that the European community is much more aware of foot health than the American population. "Some of the best shoe designs come from Europe, with companies such as Birkenstock and Mephisto. Augmenting every national consumer market is a military and industrial market that is increasingly aware that a substantial number of military disabilities and occupational problems can be addressed by orthoses.
<P>While Amfit is already deeply involved in the global orthotic marketplace, Tadin warns, "Nobody's going to get rich from this. The domestic marketplace is tough enough, and going overseas makes it even tougher when you factor in distributors and other problems."
<P>What will revolutionize the concept and economics of global orthoses is the proliferation of office scanners, such as Benefoot's ScanCast and the Bergmann Optical Scanner. There are now plans to place those scanners in practitioners' offices around the planet. That will expand the market for orthoses, but again fragment it. Remember, it's a two-way street. Foreign designed and controlled scanners from France and Belgium are already in the wings. 
<P>That means U.S. practitioners will have to confront not only American technology but global technology. In that vein, innovators such as Bergmann, Benefoot, ADT, Amfit, and others will have to contend not only with their well-entrenched marketplace--the American biomechanics mainstream--but the global village as well. What will drive developments? Standards from America, or standards from other continents? 
<P>It's just another sign that the speed and ease of technology always brings with it a whole new complex set of problems.

<H1>Composite Materials for Orthoses and Prosthetics</H1>
<P><I>by Douglas A. Taylor, CP</I>
</CENTER>
<P>A composite is a combination of two or more structural materials whose mechanical properties are markedly different from its individual constituents. As such, composites have many advantages over other available materials for prosthetic and orthotic applications: they can be designed with higher stiffness and strength and with lower weight. 
<P>Selecting the proper combination of fiber or fiber blends and polymer or polymer blends for a specific orthotic or prosthetic device is a great engineering problem. Factors affecting composite performance include the type of fiber, the fiber volume fraction, fiber geometry, the matrix type, and void content. The interface between the reinforcement and matrix also plays an important role in the bond between the two. These factors are not independent of each other, making it difficult to analyze the effect of each individual factor. For example, processing variables can greatly affect fiber volume fraction, fiber geometry, and void content, which in turn affect composite strength and durability. 
<P>Fiber and matrix type also can dictate the strength, stiffness, toughness, and fatigue resistance of composite parts. Moreover, the service conditions of the structure to be designed must be taken into account. Fatigue resistance, impact toughness, strength, stiffness, and weight must be evaluated. And almost any increase in toughness of a structure will result in a reduction in strength. With so many variables to consider, a basic understanding of composite materials is essential.

<H2>The Basics: Fibers and Matrix</H2> 
The constituents of composite materials consist of a reinforcement (usually fibers or particles) and a matrix or binder (usually a polymer). The principle load-bearing components in a composite material are the fibers. (In a reinforced plastic, the resin is load-bearing.) Fibers are grouped into bundles called yarns or tows. Unlike single fibers such as carbon and fiberglass, which tend to be brittle, fiber bundles do not fail catastrophically. Commonly used fiber materials are fiberglasses, carbon fibers, nylons, Kevlars, and Spectra, with a great diversity of grades and types.
<P>The matrix binds the fibers together, maintaining their alignment and enabling the composite to withstand compression, flexural, shear, and tensile loads. It also protects the fibers from mechanical damage (abrasion) and environmental attack. In addition, the matrix transfers load to the fibers through shear forces and provides all interlaminar shear strength. 
<P>The matrix should be plastic and adhesive so as to transfer stress into and out of the fibers and to stop cracks that originate in fibers. If very few fibers are added to a matrix, the material actually is weakened.
<P>There are two types of polymer matrix materials: thermoplastics and thermosets. Thermoplastic are characterized by their reformability with heat and pressure. Thermosets are generally characterized by a spatial three dimensional network of molecules that is permanent after crosslinking. Thermosets will break down if heat and pressure are applied to make a change in structure. 
<P>Nylons, polyolefins (polyethylene, polypropylene, etc.), acrylics, and polycarbonates are common thermoplastics used for orthopedic devices. Epoxies, polyesters, acrylics, vinyl esters, and acrylic modified epoxys are common thermosets for prosthetics.
<H2>Classification of Composite Materials</H2>
Composites differ in the amount of fiber contained in the structure (volume fraction), the fiber orientation, the type of fiber and resin, void content, and the process used to manufacture the structure. The volume fraction and length of the fibers are primary factors in classifying a material as a reinforced plastic, a composite, or an advanced composite. A fiber reinforced plastic (FRP or RP) will have a small amount of randomly oriented short fibers (more than 10 percent) in the resin, which will be tough but not strong. A composite material, which can also be an RP, will consist of oriented, long bundles of fiber materials (at least 7cm long) with a volume fraction of up to 50 percent fiber. An advanced composite material has a fiber volume greater than 50 percent and a modulus of elasticity greater than 200,000 MPa. Advanced composite structures are extremely light, stiff, and strong, and have a low thermal expansion. Advanced composites also have superior fatigue resistance, which is exhibited by many performance-oriented artificial feet. The proposed ISO test standard for prosthetic devices involves three million fatigue cycles. 
<P>High performance advanced composites usually are fabricated layer-by-layer from preimpregnated (prepeg) unidirectional tapes into or on the mold. Prepegs are fiber materials with the resin (thermoset or thermoplastic) applied to them before the fabricator uses them. Heat and pressure are used to consolidate (debulk or compact) and cure the material. These processes are very labor intensive and involve expensive machinery.
<P>Woven broad goods are an intermediate form and provide a convenient format for hand processes. We have been using woven broad goods in O&#34;P for many years. Unfortunately we have not optimized properties because knitted materials, although they are easy to apply, suffer from poor fiber orientation, high fiber crimp, and low volume fraction. Flat broad goods, which have also been used, make more sense as primary structural materials.
<P>Polymer resins generally are considered weak in comparison to other materials, but their properties increase with the addition of reinforcements.

<H2>Selecting Materials for Composites</H2>
The main factors affecting the choice of composite materials are performance, production rate, and cost. Here's a closer look at the advantages and disadvantages of a number of fibers.
<P><B>Fiberglass.</B> Fiberglass, a ceramic fiber made of inexpensive raw materials (sand, coke, coal), is still widely used in many industries because of competitive pricing, availability, ease of processing, and high strength. However, polymer resins have a poor bond or adhesion to fiberglass. Fiberglass has a tendency to debond, pull out, and delaminate from the matrix resin. This decreases strength but improves toughness by accumulating damage and dissipating fracture energy. Fiberglass subjected to static fatigue load will decrease its load carrying capability with time under stress. 
<P>Fiberglass is produced in many types (A, C, D, E, M, S). E-glass is the most common and widely used for reinforced plastics. S-glass is a high- strength glass fiber which has a different chemical makeup and a 40 percent higher tensile strength than E-glass. Fiberglass composites will not corrode, rust, dry rot, or water log. They have design flexibility and low cost tooling.
<P><B>Carbon.</B> Carbon is one of the best examples of a two-dimensionally covalently bonded material. As of 1985, there were 17 manufacturers with 74 grades of carbon fiber. Carbon fiber/epoxy advanced composites have been the choice of the aerospace industry when strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios were used to increase performance. 
<P>Although carbon fibers and graphite fibers have been used interchangeably, they are two different materials. Both are produced from polyacrylonitrile (PAN), rayon, or extruded pitch that is heat treated and stretched to produce high carbon content fibers. PAN based carbon fibers are heat treated at 2300 degrees F with a carbon content of 99.7 percent. Graphite fibers are heat treated at 3000 degrees F, which improves their tensile modules. Carbon fibers are chemically inert, creep-resistant, display a linear stress-strain behavior, and have a negative coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). With an elongation of 2 percent, they are elastic to failure. Moreover, their bond to resins--especially epoxy--is superior. On the downside, carbon fibers have low impact strength and very low shear modulus. What's more, they are brittle and expensive.
<P><B>Kevlar.</B> Kevlar is the most familiar trade name for the family of aromatic polyamide thermoplastic polymer fibers called aramids. Aramids are very strong in tension and are widely used as ballistic protection in non-laminated dry forms. Aramids come in low and high modulus types. Kevlar has low density, high specific strength, good toughness, and is damage tolerant. Delamination is the mechanism for absorbing energy. Kevlar absorbs moisture (up to 3 percent), has poor adhesion to polymers and low compressive strength (which makes it poor for beams and tubes).
<P><B>Spectra.</B> This ultra high molecular weight polyethylene fiber (UHUMP) is very high in tensile strength and low in weight. Polyethylene fibers usually do not adhere well to resins. UHMPE must be plasma-treated to improve mechanical bond to resins.
<H2>The Importance of Adhesion</H2>
Good composite performance often depends on the degree of adhesion between fibers and matrix which, in turn, depends on the state of the fiber surface. Most fibers are treated chemically or mechanically to improve adhesion to the resin matrix and to protect the fiber during processing steps. Surface treatments greatly enhance shear strength by removing the weak boundary layer at the fiber surface. Interface treatments also decrease impact and fracture toughness by reducing fiber slip in the matrix.
<H2>Other Considerations</H2>
Thermoplastic composites have good strength and stiffness. The ductility of the resin also makes them tough. However, thermoplastic composite materials cannot be economically fabricated from raw materials in the average O &#38; P or pedorthic lab because the resin must be melted, not mixed like thermosets. 
<P>Thermoplastic prepegs, in sheet form, can be heated and draped over simple, gently curbed molds such as foot orthoses. But complex molds such as prosthetic sockets and AFOs cause fiber buckling on the inside of the bend, which is cosmetically undesirable and structurally inferior. This is caused by the inability of the layers to slide over each other during draping. The matrix cannot be completely melted without running out of the fiber. These problems will have to be solved before thermoplastic prepegs can be useful for complex orthopedic devices.
<P>In our practice we use combinations of 3K plain weave cloths and unidirectional tapes of carbon fiber which are laid up by hand, bagged, and the resin run. We use only cosmesis for primary structures because felt and sockinet greatly increase weight. In a standard prosthetic socket we only use 40 to 60 grams of resin, 3 to 6 layers of plain weave carbon fiber, and 6 to 8 unitape. Below knee sockets usually weigh about 100 grams trimmed.
<P>With a basic understanding of fibers and matrix, along with careful consideration of all the variables involved, it is possible to develop a composite material for orthotic and prosthetic applications that is far superior to its individual components.

<H1>The Diabetic Athlete
<BR>Part One</H1>

<P><I>by Martin W. Sandala, DPM</I>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<B>For the purpose of this article, the term <A HREF="#IDDM">IDDM</A>, "insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus" will replace the terms "Type I Diabetes" or "Juvenile Diabetes."  <A HREF="#NIDDM">NIDDM</A> or "non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus" will replace the terms "Type II" or "Adult Onset Diabetes," indicating those patients who are non-insulin-dependent but who may require insulin in addition to oral medication to control blood glucose.</B>
<HR>
Diabetes treatment can be viewed as triangular in shape with diet, insulin, and exercise at each apex. Epidemiologically-speaking, exercise is often the missing link. From the patient's point of view, it is obviously simpler and more convenient to eat a good meal and take medication than it is to embark on a rigorous course of regular exercise. Without exercise, however, treatment of diabetes is somewhat inadequate. Today, it is common knowledge that exercise not only lowers blood sugar, but also assists in the maintenance of healthy blood lipid levels. 
<P>Diabetes is not simply a problem of carbohydrate metabolism, as is commonly understood; it is also a significant problem of lipid metabolism. By burning calories, exercise greatly aids non-insulin dependent diabetics (90 percent of whom are statistically overweight) in reducing their blood glucose. 
<P>Diabetics run a higher risk of heart disease and should seek medical consultation with their physician to determine if a treadmill-type electrocardiograph is necessary before engaging in any type of training activity. This is particularly important if the patient is age 35 or older.
<P>If peripheral nerve or microvascular problems are an issue, patients should avoid activities that might injure blood vessels in the eyes or feet. Weight lifting positions, in particular, may present a problem. If the level of the head is positioned below the heart and patients are not extremely careful with their breathing technique, they may build up their intrathoracic pressure, raise their peripheral blood pressure, and induce hemorrhaging in the retinas. Jumping rope or performing martial arts may present similar problems. On the other hand, cycling, walking, and swimming are ideal types of exercise for most diabetic patients and frequently help reduce or alleviate the effects of neuropathy.
<P>After each exercise session, diabetics with neuropathy must be cautioned to examine their feet for blisters, corns, calluses, and other evidence of traumatic injury. If any of these developments occur, immediate medical attention is required.
<P>Consistent exercise programs build muscular and cardiovascular strength and have been shown to decrease or eliminate the need for insulin completely in non-insulin dependent diabetics. Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes often can reduce their insulin intake by up to 30-40 percent. By lowering blood sugar and preventing the need for high doses of insulin, exercise can reduce the increased risk diabetics have of incurring heart disease and hypertension. NIDDM diabetics often are able to sharply decrease or eliminate the need for medication altogether, especially if weight loss has occurred.
<P>The average diabetic patient's foot and leg are particularly susceptible to complications typified by the by-products of diabetes--vascular disease and neuropathy. Taken together, these conditions--in addition to hyperglycemia in general--produce a considerable combination of pedal conditions that may include features as simple as disorders of the toenails or callus formation, or as complicated as those involving muscles, nerves, and bone tissue. Even the most minute trauma can speedily develop into a far more complicated process involving infection, ulceration, gangrene, and ultimately amputation. Although diabetes mellitus is the cause of both vascular and neurological conditions, the exact mechanism for which this occurs is not clearly defined. Since the outcome of the Diabetes Complications and Control Trial (DCCT), a clear relationship between tight blood glucose control and a considerable decrease in the acceleration of diabetic complications has been demonstrated.
<P>Blood glucose in nondiabetic individuals is regulated within a very narrow range, virtually 24 hours per day. On average, this range varies from 60 to 110 mg/dl.
<P>Insulin, the major hormonal regulator of blood glucose, has two distinct actions: It is essential for cellular uptake of glucose from the circulation and it blocks the process of lipolysis, the breakdown of triglycerides into free fatty acids.

<H2>Blood Sugar Regulation and its Response to Exercise</H2>
It clearly has been shown that exercise rapidly causes an increased tissue demand for energy in the form of glucose and oxygen. The latter is met by increases in the rate and depth of respiration, whereas energy demands are met by a sequence of metabolic requirements. To prevent blood glucose levels from falling below normal, the immediate energy demands of exercising muscle are met by the breakdown of muscle glycogen (similar to glycogen release) and fat into glucose and free fatty acids, respectively. The amount of muscle glycogen is small and thus this response is considerably short-lived. Following the exhaustion of the muscle glycogen supply (which is converted to glucose), additional glucose is supplied to exercising muscle by the following mechanisms:
<P><B>1. Glycogenolysis:</B> Hepatic glucose output rises drastically due to the breakdown of stored glycogen. The uptake of glucose by exercising muscle increases considerably over that observed in the resting muscle state. Serum glucose levels are maintained at original levels or lower, through the combined effect of glycogenolysis and increased glucose uptake by exercising muscles. This process is referred to as the "insulin sparing" effect of exercise. The increased uptake of glucose by muscle, along with the increased hepatic glycogenolysis levels, are tightly coordinated so that there is a significant increase in muscle glucose utilization in the absence of major changes in blood glucose concentration.
<P><B>2.Gluconeogenesis:</B> Additional energy requirements for exercising muscle are met by the increased rate of lipolysis which, as explained previously, results in the formation of glucose and ketones. Uncontrolled lipolysis and ketone formation can produce a potentially lethal condition known as ketoacidosis. 
<P>Although many diabetic patients, particularly those that are insulin-dependent, avoid exercise because of their fear of hypoglycemic episodes, this need not be the case. By taking a new approach to regulating their diabetes, potentially dangerous hypoglycemic episodes can be avoided.
<P>Next month, in the second part of this article, a blueprint for accomplishing this goal will be presented. 
<P>
<HR>
<CENTER>
<H3>Diabetes mellitus, in most reduced terms, is a disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to the inadequate action of insulin on peripheral tissues.</H3>
</CENTER
<P>
<B><A NAME="IDDM">IDDM</A> (Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus):</B> Approximately 10 percent of patients suffer from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In these individuals, there is a failure of pancreatic beta cells to produce and secrete insulin. IDDM develops rapidly and the onset is usually severe. It consistently presents in underweight patients, usually below the age of 30. If insulin is not replaced in these individuals, they will shortly die from ketoacidosis. Their blood glucose levels typically fluctuate greatly throughout the day and they can develop life-threatening ketoacidosis after relatively short periods of inadequate glucose control. With proper treatment, this dark prognosis can be avoided.
<P><B><A NAME="NIDDM">NIDDM</A> (Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus):</B> Approximately 90 percent of diabetics suffer from non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The primary defect of this disorder is a poorly understood resistance of peripheral tissues to the action of circulating insulin. The pancreas compensates by secreting larger and larger doses of insulin, but, over time, the insulin levels begin to decline. This phenomenon represents pancreatic exhaustion. These individuals are generally obese (approximately 85 percent) and are usually over the age of 30. Glucose levels are usually elevated; they do remain fairly stable throughout the day. The appearance of ketoacidosis rarely occurs due to the persistent presence of elevated insulin levels which are able to effectively block uncontrolled lipolysis. As seen with individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, patients with NIDDM are at increased risk of death from heart disease and stroke.

<H1>Working With Stroke Patients</H1>
<P><I>by David M. Morris, PT</I>
</CENTER>

<P>While the therapeutic pool has been advocated for the treatment of many types of physical disorders, special adaptations in equipment and techniques are often required to meet the needs of particular patient populations. Stroke patients are no exception. For these patients, abnormal muscle tone, sensory loss, and perceptual difficulties can challenge the effectiveness of an aquatic therapy treatment program. However, a few simple adaptations in these programs can help stroke patients overcome most of the adverse effects.

<H2>Muscle Tone Disorders</H2>
Both high and low muscle tone disorders can pose a challenge to treatment in the pool. Extremities with low muscle tone are dramatically influenced by buoyancy. Many hemiplegic patients experience difficulty keeping their more affected leg on the floor of the pool because it floats so well. Some aquatic therapists have advocated adding ankle weights to the hypotonic leg during standing activities. This adaptation, however, only temporarily solves the problem and limits the number and types of activities the client can perform. Instead, the physical therapist can emphasize having the patient shift his or her weight to the buoyant leg. If necessary, the physical therapist can assist by placing his or her knee and hands over the patient's affected hip and knee to keep them from buckling. 
<P>Hypertonicity also may lead to difficulties controlling weightbearing on the client's ankles during gait activities. Increased muscle tone often leads to ankle plantarflexion and inversion during the stance phase of gait, placing potentially harmful stress on the patient's entire lower extremity. A plastic ankle foot orthosis (AFO) can be used to stabilize the ankle. Generally, off the shelf or stock AFOs are adequate. The AFO, however, must be secured to the patient's ankle by a shoe. Inexpensive canvas deck shoes (less that $10) work well for this purpose because they do not absorb large amounts of water that could lead to added weight during the client's swing phase.

<H2>Sensory Loss</H2>
Some authors have suggested that patients with sensation loss, particularly proprioceptive impairment, may not be appropriate candidates for aquatic therapy. They believe that the decreased weightbearing experienced in the pool further diminishes needed input from the patient's joint receptors. These notions can be challenged, however, as proprioceptive sensation involves many input sources (such as muscle, cutaneous, and vestibular receptors), many of which are heightened during pool activities. For example, a limb in the water receives constant and increased input to touch and pressure receptors. These input signals are further increased with movement through the water. Therefore, aquatic activities such as arm circles and leg kicks may improve the client's ability to receive and process sensory input. This heightened sensory input may positively influence the practice of functional skills in the water (i.e., transfers, walking).
<P>A loss of sensation impairs function and can lead to injury, such as scraping the toes on the pool floor. This problem may be compounded by other medical disorders, including diabetes. To protect patients against cuts and scrapes of the toes and feet, athletic socks are an inexpensive and effective option.

<H2>Perceptual Problems</H2>
Individuals often experience perceptual difficulties following a stroke. Midline orientation, depth perception, and figure ground problems are examples of some of the manifestations of these deficits. The therapeutic pool may compound these problems because of glare, moving water, and refractory effects. Activities performed in supine positions, such as the Bad Ragaz Ring Method, can worsen these problems. For this reason, vertical activities, such as sitting and standing, should be the focus of treatment for patients with perceptual difficulties. Additionally, the pool surrounding can be adapted to provide an orienting frame of reference. For example, vertical lines can be painted on the pool building wall and used to promote midline orientation. Since poor vision will only compound perceptual problems, prescription eyeglasses should always be worn during aquatic therapy activities.
<H2>Summary</H2>
The therapeutic pool can be an effective environment for stroke rehabilitation. However, the aquatic therapist must be aware of the special problems encountered by stroke patients, some of which potentially can be worsened during therapeutic pool activities. Most of these problems can be alleviated if the aquatic therapist considers a few basic adaptations to his or her typical aquatic therapy regime.

<H2><IMG SRC="/graphics/bullets/cyansq.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="9"> AOFAS Seal of Approval</H2>
The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society has finally announced its Healthy Shoe Seal of Approval. The news immediately made headlines on Good Morning America and in the Wall Street Journal, which interviewed Glen Pfeffer, MD, who has championed the Seal as his pet project for five years. The story was first reported last November in <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>. 
<P>The AOFAS Healthy Shoe Seal program will test submitted shoes for 14 components, <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> has learned exclusively. Of those, AOFAS views the most critical five as heel design, toebox dimensions, fit characteristics, slip resistance, and what is described as "overall comfort," AOFAS sources said. Other criteria include whole shoe cushioning, shock absorption of the heel, breathability of the upper, and counter lining friction. Comfort itself will be measured by standardized tests for eight parameters.
<P>The new standards were created by the Orthoses and Shoewear Committee of AOFAS after consultation with a number of experts and several organizations. Based on scales, as yet undisclosed, each shoe will either pass or fail the Seal test. It will take about two months for any evaluation using outside testing agencies, according to AOFAS sources. AOFAS will ask submitting manufacturers for sizes 6, 6 1/2, 7, and 7 1/2, as well as an application fee sufficient to cover the testing, now thought to be several thousand dollars. Dr. Pfeffer states that the fee will be budget neutral to AOFAS, which will not retain any of the money.
<P>How the AOFAS Seal is greeted by the industry and consumers is yet to be seen. The first shoe to be awarded the AOFAS Seal is Rockport's Sumedale model. At least one manufacturer has offered to create or modify a shoe to meet AOFAS criteria, according to sources. Dick Jacobson, president of the Fashion Footwear Association of New York, was quoted in <CITE>Footwear News</CITE>, citing the AOFAS seal as a move to compete with the American Podiatric Medical Association's Seal of Acceptance.
<P>Most observers contacted by <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> felt that to be useful, the APMA and AOFAS seals should function independently and not compete.

We're not sure if it was before or after he was fitted with a new leg by RGP Prosthetic Research Center that Disabled Sports USA Executive Director Kirk Bauer made his decision. But all involved were happy with the outcome as RGP became DS/USA's first Official Service Provider for the 1996 Paralympics and Bauer was fitted with his first new prosthesis in 20 years.
<P>DS/USA is a member of the U.S. Olympic Committee and is responsible for training top amputee athletes for this year's Paralympics in Atlanta, Georgia. RGP's commitment to Disabled Sports USA involves cutting edge technology, on-site repair service, and financial support.

<H2><IMG SRC="/graphics/bullets/greensq.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="9"> NYSPMA wows 'em for less</H2>
Exhibitors and not a few editors were surprised at the New York State Podiatric Medical Association's Clinical Conference when lunch was served on Saturday. Not only was there a bountiful array of hotdogs, pizzas, and other noshables, but it was free. That's right, free. After establishing a reputation among exhibitors as medicine's most expensive place to buy a muffin and Coke (yes, $3 for the smallest Coke bottle in Manhattan), NYSPMA detected that more than a few vendors were fed up--or at least not fed well. Indeed, this year's exhibitor attendance was noticeably down, with many key vendors either absent or displaying in smaller than usual space. Although those decisions are tied to the market factors, vendors never miss the opportunity to gripe about the exorbitant eats at the show. NYSPMA got the message, providing free noshes, a serenading jazz trio, and even threw in beer on the house. They were also quick to offer 20 percent discounts to vendors committing on the spot to the 1997 show. Among the early takers was Soft Spots Shoes, which is reaching out to the biomechanics mainstream.

<H2><IMG SRC="/graphics/bullets/redsq.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="9"> <CITE>Stride Magazine</CITE> in the box</H2> 
A host of biomechanics and footwear vendors are joining "the Stride Movement." Some 300,000 <CITE>Stride Magazine</CITE> subscription cards are being placed in packages of comfort and athletic shoes, insoles, orthosis boxes, and even walking music tapes. The long stuffer list includes the shoeboxes of Soft Spots, Nursemates, Carolina Shoes, Clarke, Roundtree, Rohde, Mephisto, Dansko, Southern Comfort, Sequoia, and many others. Easy Spirit will be giving them out in shoebags in their stores. At least three insole manufacturers have joined the effort: Spenco, Johnson & Johnson Specialist, and Superfeet. A number of foot orthotic labs, including Benefoot, Allied-OSI, PAL, and Bloch, are inserting cards into the bags patients receive. Universal Footcare is also stuffing the cards in its practitioner kits, and Sports Music is stuffing them in its walking music audio tapes. "Joining the <CITE>Stride</CITE> subscription campaign shows consumers and practitioners alike that vendors are serious about healthy biomechanics," said Stride Editor-In-Chief Edwin Black.
<P>Last year, International Features, publishers of <CITE>Stride</CITE> and <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>, received a Folio award for innovating a similar subscription concept for its computer magazine <CITE>OS/2 Professional</CITE>, when IBM stuffed more than 450,000 cards in boxes of IBM software.

In an article on foams and Poron by Mark Caselli, DPM, (The Foam Zone, January) and Lauren S. Jones, DPM, the authors mentioned that PPT was no longer made of Poron. By way of expansion, PPT is still a widely sold soft tissue supplement but made of a different foam material.

<BR><FONT SIZE=+2><B>How Lower Extremity Biomechanics Affects Upper Body Pitching</B></FONT SIZE>
<P>
<P><I>by Kevin R. Cappel, PT, ATC</I>
</CENTER>
<P>The mechanics of pitching a baseball have been studied and debated for quite some time. Until recently, however, valid and accurate scientific data relating to proper mechanics that could improve performance and decrease injury have not been available for clinical use. Now, numerous studies underline the importance for the clinician to translate this data into functional understanding and apply the principles to their pitching patients.
<P>By and large, the vast majority of injuries sustained by pitchers occur to the dominant shoulder and/or elbow. Typically these injuries involve either some degree of instability to the anterior-inferior glenohumeral ligament complex (AIGHLC), an eccentric overload syndrome to the posterior contractile tissues of the shoulder, or a medial elbow valgus overload (Little League elbow). It has been found that when an injured pitcher's mechanics can be videographed and analyzed frame by frame, a significant number of these injuries could be secondary to less than ideal mechanics, and a large percentage of the observed mechanical errors originate with the lower extremities. These errors initially may appear small in magnitude, but they become significantly magnified as force generation and sequential movement are translated superiorly.
<P>Most researchers divide the biomechanics of pitching into five phases: the wind-up, early and late cocking phases, acceleration, and follow-through. The wind-up is important for helping the pitcher develop a rhythm, a rhythm  that can cause a sense of deception or distraction for the hitter. The early cocking phase is the focus of lower extremity involvement and we will discuss it here in great detail. Late cocking involves the movement that occurs after the placement of the lead foot and up to the point of maximal external rotation of the throwing shoulder. Acceleration is defined as the point of maximal external rotation of the shoulder until the moment of ball release. Acceleration is the shortest phase of the overall motion, accounting for only approximately two percent of the entire pitch. The follow-through, then, encompasses the cessation of motion after ball release.
<P>Early cocking, by definition, begins at the point where the pitcher's lead knee reaches its peak height, and concludes when the lead foot has become planted. From start to finish during this phase, the pitcher's non-throwing shoulder and hip should be directed at the target. To do justice to the study of the early cocking phase, it must be divided into upper and lower halves, splitting the body at the waist.
<P>In discussing the upper half, the key focus is achieving a good "cocked" position of the throwing arm at approximately 90 degrees of shoulder abduction, 45-90 degrees of shoulder external rotation, and approximately 90 degrees of elbow flexion. To reach this position as efficiently as possible, the ball must be removed from the glove at relatively the same time the lead leg begins its forward and downward movement. The arc of movement of the arm should be likened to that of a pendulum, swinging down--out--and--up in the frontal plane. An excess amount of shoulder extension and/or horizontal abduction tends to cause excessive and unnecessary stress to the AIGHLC. The non-throwing arm should abduct toward the target and act as the pitcher's gun sight, if you will.
<P>The lower half of the early cocking phase serves as the base and a major focus for the entire pitch. Balance is critical. As the pitcher transitions from the wind-up to early cocking, the ability to maintain balance will ultimately control consistency from pitch to pitch. If balance is not attained at this transition, compensations will have to be made elsewhere in the body to regain balance, which could lead to unnecessary and unusual stresses and/or poor pitch location.
<P>As the lead foot and leg begin movement toward the target, the hips must remain closed (that is, the lateral hip should be pointed directly at the target) at foot contact. For this to occur, three observations should be made: the stride offset, the stride angle, and the arc (quality) of the stride.

<H2>Stride Offset</H2>
Stride offset refers to the placement of the lead foot relative to a line drawn between the midfoot of the foot in contact with the rubber, and home plate. Ideal placement would have the lead foot landing within three inches of either side of the line. If a right handed pitcher lands with the lead foot more than three inches left of the line, it is an "open stride offset." As this occurs, the hips "open up," or rotate toward the target prematurely. Consequently, all other rotation toward the target follows the hips prematurely and the throwing shoulder is left in a position of relative horizontal abduction. This potentially adds a great deal of stress to the AIGHLC, and could be a major contributing cause to the subtle instabilities often seen in pitchers. If the same pitcher lands with the lead foot to the right of the line, it is said to be a "closed stride offset." This foot placement may make it difficult to achieve complete hip rotation to the target and may inhibit full utilization of the trunk. It also may increase the stress to the posterior soft tissues attempting to decelerate the forces during the follow-through. 

<H2>Stride Angle</H2>
Stride angle refers to the position in which the lead foot has been placed. In simplest terms, this is a measure of the direction in which the foot is pointed. Ideal placement would have the toes angled slightly (15-30 degrees) to the third base side of home plate (for a right handed pitcher). The position to avoid is, once again, an open stride angle, with the toes directed toward the first base side of home plate. To land with an open stride angle, the lead hip would have to externally rotate, and thus prematurely rotate the hips toward the target. This places the body into the same scenario as previously described with the open stride offset. Imagine the result when an open stride offset occurs simultaneously with an open stride angle.
<H2>Stride Arc</H2>
More times than not, one or both of these pathomechanical errors can be corrected by changing the arc of the lead leg's motion. In my experience, the most common error has been for the lead leg to move toward the target like a "swinging gate". In other words, the leg, more or less, circumducts externally. This circumduction tends to cause the resultant premature hip rotation.  It also becomes easier to "overshoot" the ideal stride offset, especially as fatigue plays a greater role. Rather than "swinging gate," the pitcher should simply stride directly toward the target. If the pitcher now lands with a slightly closed stride angle, it is very difficult for the hips to rotate open prematurely.
<H2>Stride Length</H2>
The final point pertaining to foot placement that must be considered is stride length. Studies carried out on highly successful, upper-level pitchers indicate that the recommended stride length should be approximately 90 percent of body height. Stride lengths in excess of this would indicate that the pitcher may be thrusting off the rubber too aggressively. There are two negative side effects to this habit. First, since the base of support is so wide, the center of gravity drops. If the center of gravity drops during the delivery, the ball will too, and control may be a problem. It is also considered an advantage to be throwing downhill to the hitter. By allowing the center of gravity to descend, the pitcher forfeits some of the benefit of throwing from an elevated mound. Of greater clinical relevance, however, is the potential that the center of gravity will be farther from its base of support (the lead foot) when the back foot leaves the rubber. This may inhibit utilization of the entire body during the follow-through and again cause overload to the posterior shoulder.
<P>As clinicians working with patients who are pitchers, we must consider the entire kinetic chain when assessing for mechanical faults. With the extreme forces generated and the repetitive nature of the activity, subtle errors in the early cocking phase left uncorrected may prevent that pitcher from returning to the mound.

<P>Just about two years ago, a handful of journalists assembled in Chicago at the Midwest Podiatry Conference and premiered <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>, the first cross-speciality feature publication for lower extremity biomechanics. They said it couldn't be done. We did it. Here's a report card.
<P>Today we have some 50,000 readers, including virtually all American orthopaedic surgeons, podiatrists, orthotists, prosthetists, clinical athletic trainers, pedorthists, and most physical therapists, physiatrists, and chiropractors concentrated in lower extremity biomechanics. 
<P>To pursue our mission of increasing the patient base, we have now launched <CITE>Stride</CITE> as a patient and comfort shoe store publication that reaches many thousands spreading the message about healthy biomechanics and the practitioners who can help.
<P>Earlier this year we launched the BioMechanics Gateway at www.biomech.com/biomech, which places a world of biomechanics and other information at the fingertips of practitioners and links them to others around the corner and around the planet. From our Website, practitioners can access professional organizations from the American Medical Association to the American Podiatric Medical Association. You can connect to publications as diverse as the <CITE>Journal of American Medical Association</CITE> to <CITE>Physical Therapy</CITE> to <CITE>Stride</CITE>. You can tap into constantly updating news sources such as CNN, or the weather anywhere. All government Websites are at your disposal with fast links to health industry sites such as the FDA, CDC, and HCFA. The entire <A HREF="/biomech/bdr96/><CITE>BioMechanics Desk Reference</CITE></A> is on our site. What's more, private and public Websites globally are directly linked to us. It's all happening so fast, additional construction occurs daily. We literally multiply our services daily. 
<P>Every day more vendors are establishing direct e-mail connections and links to their home pages on the BioMechanics Gateway. Moreover, orthotic labs such as Riecken's are posting their entire catalog up on our Website. Others, such as Benefoot, plan to post foot scanner tutorials. The idea is not just to create a silly and short-lived diversion, but a useful tool for practitioner productivity that will contain valuable and constantly updated news, views, and information. 
<P>At press time, we're the only major healthcare site audited by the Internet Audit Bureau. Unlike some counters which can count one person as 10 visitors if the page contains 10 elements, our audit service counts individual Internet addresses.
<P>To continue our mission of bringing the biomechanics mainstream to the Web, a few weeks ago we launched 14 new Websites, each tailored to a specific profession or biomechanical area of interest. Each offers a wealth of focused information and as time goes on, we hope, each will represent the most connected offerings of their kind. The self-explanatory sites are:

<P>In addition, <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> has formed a new division, <B>WebWise</B>, headed by Bradley Kliewer, our vice president of technology. WebWise will create extremely low-cost generic home pages for practitioners, associations, and small vendors. People are getting soaked in this field, paying exorbitant fees with many hidden charges to get up on the Web. We hope WebWise can help practitioners reach their patients, associations reach their members, and vendors reach the biomechanics mainstream in ways that might otherwise be unavailable because of cost or lack of opportunity. To contact WebWise, hit any of our Websites and send a note to the Webmaster, e-mail me at <A HREF="mailto:eblack@bix.com">eblack@bix.com</A> or fax a note to (301) 770-7062.
<P>We now embark upon our third year. Shortly, we shall unveil six special editions of <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> for a variety of practitioner groups, covering topics from the Paralympics to managed care. You have to walk before you can run. And we're just hitting our stride. <BR><B>--Edwin Black</B>

<H1>Hip Bracing for Neurological Pathologies and Other Considerations</H1>
<P><I>by Wally Motloch, CO</I>
</CENTER>

<P>The hip is a "ball and socket" joint with very little inherent support. Its multi-axial motion allows hip flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and internal and external rotation. Dynamic stability is provided by the coordinated actions of the muscles surrounding the hip, known as the pelvic cuff, which is a group of muscles that stabilizes the joint. When various pathological conditions of the muscle, bones, and nerves interfere with proper hip joint function and stability, orthotic intervention is prescribed.
<P>Unlike the anatomical hip, mechanical hip joints most often are single axis (flex/extend) and sometimes dual axis (flex/extend and abduct/adduct). The mechanical joints either allow some range of motion or lock it out, as with drop locks. When motion is allowed, it can be limited to a certain number of degrees or dynamically controlled, as in a Reciprocating Gait Orthosis (RGO). In rare cases, orthotic hip joints, such as the Multi-Axial Sub Perineal (MASP), allow a multi-axial, limited range of motion.
<P>With the various combinations of joint designs, stop arrangements and locking/guiding mechanisms available, orthotists can provide patients with the necessary function. The following guidelines provide orthotic solutions to a number of hip pathologies.
<P><B><I>Cerebral Palsy (CP) and other Leg Rotation Problems.</I></B> Cerebral palsy is a loss or deficiency of muscle control due to permanent, nonprogressive brain damage occurring before or at the time of birth. Difficulty walking, poor coordination, and lack of balance are some characteristics of the disorder.
<P>Bracing of cerebral palsy patients is not as common as it once was. Patients with leg braces often require hip joints to help guide the path of their legs. However, the spastic muscles of cerebral palsy patients can cause the legs to internally rotate and adduct. As a result, the legs may collide with each other or rub at the knees (scissor). Leg braces and hip braces connected by a pelvic band may be necessary to control excessive adduction and knee flexion. In this case, the hip joint must allow easy flexion/extension but be exceedingly strong (pelvic bend and hip joints are welded for strength and rigidity) to resist the massive adduction force.
<P>The same braces used to treat cerebral palsy patients also can be used to treat other leg rotation problems, such as excessive in-toeing. 
<P><B><I>Muscular Dystrophies and other Myopathies.</I></B> Muscular dystrophies are non-inflammatory inherited disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness. There are several types of muscular dystrophy, classified by their inheritance pattern, but the most common to orthotists is the Duchenne's. This is a sex-linked recessive abnormality of young males that initially results in clumsy walking, decreased motor skills, lumbar lordosis, and gluteus maximus and quadricep weakness [see <I><A HREF="/biomech/jan96/braces.html">Bracing for Muscular Dystrophy,</I></A> January]. Proper physical exercise enhances pulmonary status and muscle strength. Bracing focuses on substituting for weak muscles and enhancing ambulation before pulmonary status deteriorates. 
<P>At the beginning of the disease process, patients need very little orthotic help--perhaps as little as AFOs. Then, as the muscles weaken, KAFOs come into play. As the pelvic girdle weakens and the spine starts to deform, HKAFOs with a body jacket are needed. To prolong the period of independence, the locking mechanism of the hip joint should be activated with minimum force and dexterity. Avoid using drop locks or complicated knobs. Consider an easy to operate system, such as the "preselected" hip lock with finger loop, which is a unique way to lock and unlock hip joints that requires very little hand and finger strength.
<P><B><I>Developmental Dysplasia of Hip (DDH).</I></B> This disorder, previously known as Congenital Dysplasia of Hip (CDH), is characterized by abnormal development of the acetabulum and/or dislocations of the head of the femur secondary to capsular laxity and mechanical factors. Included in the spectrum of problems are complete dislocation, subluxation, instability, and hip dysplasia.
<P>Orthoses are intended to hold the patient's legs abducted, with the hip joints normally locked at 180 degrees. Only when the patient is allowed to sit is the drop lock disengaged to let the hips flex to 90 degrees. The Pavlik harness is used for younger patients--usually infants before the ages of 12-15 months and before upright standing and ambulation. When the condition is serious enough, and the child is ambulatory, braces then can be used. 
<P><B><I>Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease.</I></B> This condition, also known as Legg-Perthes Disease, or Perthes, is marked by avascular necrosis of the head of the femur, and usually develops in boys 4-8 years of age. Bony necrosis is followed by revascularization, resorption, and eventual remodeling of the head. Braces are used to hold the affected leg in abduction and internal rotation in order to contain the head of the femur in the acetabulum. This unique application requires no external hip joints because the frame of the brace holds the legs (hips) in abduction and internal rotation. The ball joints on the Toronto Legg Perthes brace are for the benefit of the knee and ankle joints.
<P><B><I>Proximal Femoral Focal Deficiency (PFFD).</I></B> Proximal femoral focal deficiency is a developmental defect in which the middle of the femur or thigh bone is missing. It is characterized by a short bulky thigh that is flexed, abducted, and externally rotated. Individualized orthotic or prosthetic treatment is based on leg length discrepancy, adequacy of proximal musculature, femoral rotation, and proximal joint stability. It may be necessary to construct an orthosis, prosthesis, or orthoprosthesis to treat this difficult condition. The hip joint essentially suspends the orthopedic device, helps guide the leg, and limits the Trendenburg gait. If the shortening is small (4 to 7 inches) then a brace is used. If the shortening is more, a prosthetic appliance can be used.
<P><B><I>Arthrogryposis.</I></B> Arthrogryposis is a very rare nonprogressive disorder of multiple etiologies associated with loss of anterior horn cells and other neural elements in the spinal cord. The condition causes rigidity of most of the joints, along with lack of muscle development and growth.
<P>If the condition is severe enough, a pelvic band is needed with free motion or RGO type hip joints to allow flex/extend and to control abduction/adduction and leg rotation. This is necessary to help guide the legs.
<P><B><I>Anterior Horn Cell Disorders.</I></B> These disorders include poliomyelitis (polio), a viral destruction of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and brain stem, and spinal muscle atrophy, also known as Werding Hoffmann Disease, an autosomal recessive condition characterized by a loss of anterior horn cells from the spinal cord.
<P>The hallmark of polio is muscle weakness with no loss of normal sensation. Polio patients are great candidates for bracing because they know where their legs are in space and can feel excessive pressures. They use this biofeedback and proprioception to improve ambulation. While most polio patients do not require braces that cross the hips, in some severe cases RGO joints are used. The needs of these patients are similar to those with spina bifida.
<P>Patients with Werding Hoffman Disease have symmetric paresis with involvement of the lower extremity and proximal muscles. Lightweight hip braces similar to those used for Duchenne muscular dystrophy are recommended.
<P><B><I>Spina Bifida.</I></B> Spina bifida (myelodysplasia) is a congenital birth defect in which the neural tube that forms the spinal cord doesn't develop and/or close properly in utero, leading to a number of lower extremity problems, including muscle paralysis, hip dislocations, knee hyperextension, and clubfeet. A tethered cord, hydrocephalus, and hyromyella (increased fluid in the central canal of the cord) can cause sudden changes in function, including a rapid increase of scoliotic curvature, spasticity, and new neurological deficit. Fractures are common because of osteoporosis or weak bones due to no weightbearing or muscle compression on the bone.
<P>Some spina bifida patients will never walk, but with a thorough knowledge of bracing technology, medical professionals can offer some children with spina bifida the ability to walk. The muscle deficit and therefore the amount of bracing that will be required for treating spinal bifida patients depends on the size of the opening of the neural tube, its location along the spinal column, and the degree of nerve involvement. Many patients with mild involvement require no orthosis at all, while those with severe involvement cannot be helped at all by orthoses. Most patients fall into the middle group, and these need to be dynamically braced around the hip, since they are missing the use of the large, powerful and essential hip extensors--the very muscles that enable us to stand erect and ambulate. 
<P>The best candidates for braces are patients whose lumbar 4th segment (L4) nerves are working and who are "moderately involved." Frequently prescribed devices include Standing Braces, Parapodium, Three Degrees of Freedom Orthosis (TDFC), and Reciprocating Gait Orthosis (RGOs), but especially the ISOCENTRIC RGO because its reciprocator is free of friction and allows patients to walk farther with their limited muscles. 
<P>The TDFC orthosis includes a pair of KAFOs (Long Leg Braces) and a special Multi-Axial Sub Perineal (MASP) hip joint. The MASP joint is designed to control excessive external/internal rotation and excessive leg abduction. It is similar to an Australian "Up and About" but the TDFC has been around longer and is more economically priced.
<P>In the RGO application, the movements of the legs must be controlled in such a way as to allow flexion/extension while still supporting the torso in the upright position. This three-way relationship of the torso and legs is what all RGOs try to achieve. Some European designs have introduced leg rotation, increasing this to a five-way relationship. In my opinion, increasing the complexity of the hip mechanism is worth the trouble only if it can translate into increased level of performance, lower energy cost of ambulation, smoother steps, or increased speed of walking. 
<P>Many children in RGOs with conventional hip joints are apprehensive about unlocking the joints and find it difficult to do so. This is because at the moment of unlocking, only one hand is free to stabilize the torso. When the joints are unlocked, the torso has a tendency to pitch forward and often patients become afraid of losing their balance and falling. The "preselected" hip joint eliminates this fear and improves safety.
<P>Another option is the "abduction-hinge" joint, which allows the hip joint to abduct while the patient is sitting; this facilitates bladder care without brace removal. The ability to abduct both legs allows the child to assume a more natural position for playing with toys while sitting, and to straddle a toy like a rocking horse. 
<H2>Post-Operative Protection</H2>
Following implantation of an artificial hip, acetabular alteration due to arthritis, congenital conditions or trauma to the hip, braces can help to maintain the head of the femur in the acetabulum. Hip orthoses with varying degrees of rigidity and control exist. The mechanical hip joint sets the leg into abduction and limits the flex/extend range generally between 90 and 180 degrees. To provide true femur-acetublar containment, however, leg rotation must also be controlled. Since thigh cuffs cannot adequately control this rotation, the lower leg and foot must be included in the system. An example of such a device is the Hip Integrity Protection Orthosis (HIPO).
<H2>Prosthetic Applications</H2>
With the advent of Isocentric Reciprocating Gait Orthoses, the pelvic frame with its reciprocal mechanism and strong hip joints can be used for the bilateral hip disarticulation amputee. Conventional prosthetic set ups were associated with the chronic problem of slow walking speed. There was no easy way for the patient to speed up the pendulum motion of the legs. This new combination of prosthesis with RGO mechanism provides the hip amputee with a method of walking faster. By extending the torso, energy is added to the system, speeding up the swinging of the leg.

<H1>Cross Cultural Issues in Prosthetics in Developing Countries</H1>
<P><I>by Timothy Staats, CPO</I>
</CENTER>
<P>The Can Tho Center, like many others of its kind, is in an isolated region of Vietnam--one many have forgotten about since the conclusion of America's involvement here. But make no mistake, the hundreds of civilians lined up outside this humbled building still consider America a major influence in their lives. Consider the two boys huddled next to each other like brothers, one with his legs blown off, the other with a bandage covering a scar on his chest. Swing around outside and witness a small boy pulling his father in a makeshift dolly, both legs removed to a mere stump. 
<P>Over the course of numerous violent conflicts through the years, many third world countries have been left in ruins. Vietnam, Laos, Ethiopia, Bosnia--the list grows longer every year. The problems arise after the fighting is over, when the supposed freedom (or dictatorship) is staring a new horizon in the face. The devices that won them the victory--mines, cluster bombs, napalm--still remain behind. And, unfortunately, these weapons don't know a civilian from a soldier.
<P>A mosaic of cross-cultural issues complicate the selection of prosthetics in the developing world. The measures of appropriateness are unique not only to culture, climate and terrain, but also to issues of transportation, standards, and durability.
<P>The primary cause of amputation in the modern world is vascular disease followed by trauma, tumors, and congenital limb deficiency. In comparison, limb amputation in the developing world is caused primarily by trauma from vehicular and work accidents, combined with a lack of emergency medical care. In many war zone developing countries, amputation is often the treatment of necessity when evacuation from the battlefield is delayed or impossible. In the modern world amputation occurs in about 2 per 1,000 people. In post-war zones, such as Cambodia, estimates as high as one amputee per 85 people have been reported.
<P>Staggering numbers of amputees also have been caused by landmines and unexploded ordnance from conflicts in Southeast Asia, Asia Minor, Africa, and Bosnia-Herzogovnia. Many government officials in war zone countries have very little knowledge of prosthetics technology and logically accept offers of external assistance. Humanitarian relief organizations that offer prosthetics assistance often recommend the use of existing prosthetics technology. Yet, the host country may not realize that a particular prosthetics program might be ineffective for its amputees because the technology was designed for a dramatically different set of demands. 

<H2>Transportation Issues</H2>
For many amputees in developing countries, travel is often  difficult--if not impossible. Access to remote areas is limited and in many places, it is unusual for villagers to ever travel more than 50 miles from home.
<P>In Laos central highlands, amputees and their families are sometimes grouped into villages so that it is easier for government agencies to bring them food and supplies. In bad weather, horrible roads become impassable. When combined with no public transportation options, it is difficult, if not impossible, for Lao highland people--and especially the amputee--to travel. Attempts have been made to create prosthetics outreach projects to bring better quality prosthetics limbs from central rehabilitation centers to the provinces. Surprisingly, this approach appears to be more feasible than maintaining numerous provincial workshops and poorly trained personnel. The cost of maintaining provincial centers is equivalent to bringing the higher quality services to the amputees from main centers.
<P>Transportation problems also are evident in the Gaza Strip and West Bank regions in the occupied territories of Israel. Surprisingly, the major cause of amputation in the occupied territories is not war injuries, but untreated vascular disease in older amputees, which is related as much to a lack of transportation as it is to the limited access to medical services. Tensions between Palestinians and Israeli authorities often result in closure of roads or access to and from refugee camps, making travel impossible. An amputee could spend an entire day trying to reach a prosthetics workshop and then not be able to return home for days or weeks because of curfews or travel restrictions.

<H2>Prosthetics Technology Standards</H2> 
Prosthetics technology is the combination of manufacturing techniques and the assembly of component parts of the prostheses. Prosthetics assistance in third world countries is addressed by a range of prosthetics technology choices and standards, including California Standard, German Bock Standard, International Red Cross Standard, Handicap International Standard and so forth, along with indigenous hand crafted prosthetic limbs. Cross standard technologies occur when elements from these standards are borrowed from organizations or by personnel with each other, or from upgrading to different technologies. Indigenous prosthetic designs are those made by amputees from materials they find or are adapted from prostheses they were given but have since worn out. Documenting indigenous prostheses is a good way to understand what happens to a prosthesis after the amputee uses it in normal working and living conditions.
<P><B>Prosthetics Socketology.</B> The fit and comfort of the prosthetic relates to how well the socket receptacle portion of the prosthesis matches the shape and volume of the residual limb. If measures of fit, alignment, and fabrication technique are not evident, it is apparent that the prosthetist-technician is not skilled, did not learn, did not understand, or did not care about these critical elements of prosthetics.
<P>It is possible to use absolutely the highest prosthetics technology and alignment with the poorest socketology technique and end up with terrible results. It is also possible to use the most primitive technology with excellent "socketology" and alignment to achieve good results, ignoring for the moment the durability of the prosthesis.
<P><B>Selection of Prosthetics Technology.</B> Selection is not quite the word to describe the prosthetic standard used in developing countries. More often, the choice of a prosthetics standard is based on a decision by organizations to use the prosthetic design and manufacturing technology for a large number of amputees. Since prosthetic limbs often are provided at little or no cost, the amputee typically has little say in this decision. The resulting prosthetic technology is based on the organization's previous experience, not the new situation. Moreover, funding agencies rarely ask or look for amputee outcomes in living environments in the developing world. Instead, they ask for total cost of program activities or the number of amputees fitted with artificial limbs. Whether or not the prosthetic technology provided is meeting the durability and comfort needs of the amputee is typically not addressed. If amputees were questioned about their living and working conditions it could be determined that some prosthetics standards do not meet their needs.
<P>Many prosthetics programs in war zones have a life span limited to the duration of hostilities and the international interest in that location. When the hostilities wind down the funding dries up and many prosthetics programs cease to exist or they move to the next war zone.

<H2>Durability Issues</H2>
The true success of the prosthesis in developing countries is measured by comfortable fit and durability over a period of many years (if not decades) and exposure to the elements in rugged outdoor situations, doing rigorous agriculture work. Unless the prosthetist is able to evaluate the amputee's working situations, these requirements cannot be understood. Piles of discarded limbs indicate that prosthesis longevity and durability are serious problems that many prosthetics projects do not address.
<P>The key factor of durability of the prosthesis is rarely identified in field research. If a so-called low or appropriate technology approach to prosthetics is coupled with personnel not formally trained in prosthetics, the results are marginal to poor. The philosophy of "something is better than nothing" is commonly heard. These prostheses can be built using local material and local talent, but in reality the outcome for the amputee is poor. A prosthesis that can last 10 years probably would be the measure of success in many developing countries. This seemingly simple durability requirement is remarkably difficult to manufacture. The typical modern world amputee wants a strong, lightweight, versatile, cosmetic artificial limb fitted with comfortable accuracy. In contrast, amputees in the developing world wrap a rag or strip of cloth around the stump before donning the prosthesis. Stump socks and even regular socks worn with shoes are not used if shoes are not worn.
<P>Many common skills also have appropriate technology requirements. In rice farming, it is common to wade knee deep in water to rice farm, making a waterproof and dirt tolerant prosthesis a necessity. When hunting or gathering in a forest it is common to ford a stream or climb over rocks and downed trees. When building a wood or bamboo house, heavy lifting is a certain requirement. When driving cattle or cleaning their stalls a prosthesis design that can have mud easily rinsed away is important. What modern world prosthetist would know that a Lao villager derives his living from these simple but harsh criteria?
<P>Terrain and climate in developing countries must be considered hostile environments for the prostheses, especially for modern world prosthetic standards. More durable prosthetic components could be developed if the design criteria for developing world applications were better understood. Local conditions vary greatly within countries and change dramatically during the seasons of the year. Prosthetists need to visit amputees in villages to see living and working conditions.

<H2>Appropriate Technology Materials</H2
The selection of materials used to fabricate prosthetic feet plays a role in determining appropriate technology. Polyurethane elastomeric plastics are used to manufacture many modern world prosthetic feet, but the exposure of feet to sunlight and moisture quickly causes deterioration of the prosthetic foot. Since most modern world feet are used with shoes and socks, exposure to ultraviolet sunlight is not a problem and feet are not expected to last more than three to five years (the life span of the average modern prosthesis). If the bottom surface of most modern prosthetic feet is exposed to the ground without a shoe, it will be damaged and will fall apart. If the amputee needs to squat, this position puts the average modern prosthetic foot in more flexion than the foot was designed to provide. Ankle motion is usually not important or available in many modern foot designs; this contributes to modern feet breaking in developing world situations. 
<P>Leather, which is available in most parts of the world, often is selected for the socket portion of the prosthesis. In some cases, crude leather prosthetic sockets are mounted with steel side bars with wood shank ankle and foot. This style of prostheses can be made without electricity using locally available materials by local craftsmen so it would appear to be an ideal material.
<P>But the myth of this philosophy is multi-fold: leather, while moldable, becomes shapeless when water soaked. In a desert climate it may have merit, but in tropical climates, where rainy seasons and rice-farming and agriculture are the most common forms of work, leather quickly rots, smells, and becomes quite disagreeable. Leather fails as an "appropriate technology" material where the "volume imperative" is an important issue. High volume means workshop production must be rapid flowing in all procedures. Leather is molded and formed wet and requires time to dry, slowing down any production line operation. High quality durable leather requires a somewhat sophisticated tanning process generally not available in the typical rural third world setting. If good leather is imported, by definition, it is no longer "appropriate technology." Leather also presents a cultural issue, such as in the Hindu society, where the use of materials of living things to be worn or used as clothing is frowned upon.
<P>Once the limitations of leather were understood, plastic prostheses became more commonly used in the developing world. Curiously, misappropriate technology material selections are repeated with wood, metal, rubber, and even plastics. In many ways, prosthetics technology confronts the many rules of appropriate technology. Complaints that plastics must be imported, that they are expensive, and that they fail with heavy use are reported. In reality, some plastics are imported to many modern countries, including the United States. When properly manufactured into prostheses, these plastics can be extraordinarily durable and climate proof. International organizations have accepted thermoplastics for their unlimited half life and thermosetting plastic materials for their durability. While electricity and gas ovens are required to process these materials, it is possible to manufacture prostheses much more quickly and with better accuracy using plastics than with metal, wood, or leather variations.

<H2>Lessons Learned</H2>
Developing world amputees are very understanding about the limitation or failure of prosthetics limbs. When the limb fails, they must fix it themselves or simply throw it aside. Amputees use prostheses in ways you cannot imagine. In a village, one man may have a prosthetic limb while other amputees in the village have none. It is quite possible that the prosthesis will become the "village leg" and will be worn by more than one person. Shoes, if owned or worn, are not worn into the rice paddies because they are valuable possessions and would be ruined. While many people wear flip-flop sandals, the amputee cannot, because the sandals cannot be held on the prosthetic foot. A Lao amputee was asked "whether a foot with a split in the toe for sandals would be better than walking barefoot." He responded that "what he really needed was a sturdy pair of hiking lug-soled shoes like the fellow was wearing." These simple examples changed my perceptions on the selection of prosthetics design criteria based on barefoot designs. It wasn't that the amputee wanted to walk barefoot--he could not afford or could not obtain good shoes. Likewise, other protective footwear that might protect his prosthesis from the elements were unknown or unavailable. Listening to amputees is important because they often have the solution to the problem.
<P>In most war zones, prosthetics technology usually is selected for the amputee. Amputees have little opportunity or feasibility to select or refine the design of the prostheses to meet their individual needs. There is little reason for the amputee to complain that the prosthetic design is inappropriate since nothing else is available. The appropriateness of most prosthetics technology is more a matter of how well a prosthetics standard withstands or holds up to the local conditions, not whether any thought has been given to providing or designing an appropriate technology prosthesis. This is not to say that the technology selected in a particular situation is wrong, but to call it "appropriate technology" is too great a compliment in most cases. Additional thought must be given to the end use of the prosthesis rather than counting prostheses like beans in a bowl. Appropriate technology prosthetics is what is available to the amputee.
<P>Maybe too much emphasis is placed on making limbs to meet the "volume imperative" or to keep the cost of the prosthesis as low as possible. It could be that prosthetic technology breaks these rules of "appropriate technology." What if the best materials will always make the most durable prosthesis? Do locally available materials make the most suitable prosthesis and are they really locally available? Could it be argued that a country can never truly be self-sufficient in prosthetics limb production? Could it be argued that money spent to build in-country manufacturing facilities would be better spent buying better quality prosthetic components? This certainly would address the amputee's need for prosthesis durability and also address the volume imperative since more money would be spent on prostheses than on equipment and buildings. Many amputees will get only one prosthesis and never receive another. Therefore, the appropriateness criteria should concentrate on durability.  
<P>Most amputees in developing countries can hardly afford to eat let alone afford a prosthesis. Prosthetics care will continue to be largely a humanitarian effort provided in most cases at little or no cost to the amputee. Governments and agency officials confuse the production of artificial limbs with helping amputees. A prosthetics foot or knee mechanism are only component parts of the prosthesis. If the amputee is uncomfortable and cannot use the prosthesis, the limb is no more than a collection of parts and pieces.
<P>To the amputee in the developing world, comfort and durability of the prosthesis are more important and are the honest measures of successful prosthetics programs. Until the issues of durability and appropriate technology are addressed, prosthetics will remain a humanitarian effort for the amputee in the developing world.

<H1>Orthotic Management of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease</H1>
<P><I>by Melanie Sanders, MD</I>
</CENTER>

<P>The typical changes in the foot from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are the patient's primary complaint, and an alert practitioner often is the first person to mention the possibility of this disease to the patient. Despite the heritable nature of the disease, the patient may be unaware of any family members with symptoms, particularly in the milder forms of the disease.
<P>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease involves not only the peripheral nerves, but also the motor nerve roots and frequently the spinal cord. There currently is no known metabolic cause for the nerve damage. Inheritance can occur as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or as sex-linked recessive. The mode of inheritance determines the severity of the disease and the time of onset of symptoms. 
<P>The most severe form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease occurs with autosomal recessive inheritance, where signs of peroneal atrophy begin before the age of eight. The physical changes progress relentlessly and patients may become wheelchair bound by the age of 20. The atrophy in the hands or forearms is much more prominent in patients in this category. 
<P>In patients with the sex-linked recessive form of the disease, all patients are male, receiving the defective gene carried by the mother. Signs of the disorder typically become apparent in adolescence and progress steadily. The mildest form occurs with autosomal dominant inheritance, a heterozygous condition. The pattern of clinical signs and symptoms begins after the age of 25, with gradual changes. 
<P>The hallmark of this disorder in the foot is pes cavus, associated with clawing of the toes and atrophy of the calf muscles (hence the alternative descriptor-Peroneal Muscular Atrophy). This diagnosis should be considered when evaluating any patient who presents with pes cavus, with or without other associated deformities. Questions about family history should be asked and a neurologic work up should be considered. Establishment of the diagnosis also aids in genetic counseling and may uncover additional cases of the disease within the index family.
<P>In the milder form of the disease, patients often present with fatigue symptoms due to calf and foot weakness. Since the nerve involvement often produces a degree of sensory loss, complaints of metatarsalgia may not be commensurate with the degree of deformity present. Typically, the intrinsic muscles of the foot and the short toe flexors are affected first. This initiates the elevation of the arch, and later the clawing of the toes. As the disorder progresses, the muscles of the calf become involved. Loss of function of the anterior tibial tendon results in drop foot. Although the peroneal muscles are severely affected, the relative imbalance in the pull of the peroneus longus and the anterior tibial tendon is responsible for the plantarflexion of the first ray. With severe disease, the calves develop an extremely thin cylindrical appearance. Further progression of the disease may occur into the hands and forearms, with wrist drop and loss of intrinsic strength in the hand.
<P>When the cavus posture first develops, it's flexible. Flexibility may be tested by the Coleman block test, which is performed by placing a block of wood under the lateral four metatarsals and the lateral one-half of the heel. If the hindfoot remains flexible, the heel position will correct the neutral or valgus. This  allows the first metatarsal to "drop down" below the adjacent metatarsal heads and correct the forefoot valgus. 
<P>The patient retaining flexibility in the hindfoot responds extremely well to conservative management with the correct foot orthosis. All of the principles used to protect the cavus foot in other conditions should be employed. The addition of cushion below the foot is of prime importance, and rigid materials should not be used. It is important to recognize the underlying forefoot valgus and treat this deformity with a prescribed device. Lateral posting should be provided, not only under the heel, but extending under the forefoot as well. In patients with a very prominent first metatarsal head, pressure relief in this area may be appropriate; however, attempts to cushion or relieve pressure under the metatarsal head without addressing the biomechanical disorder of the forefoot are not successful in the long term. 
<P>It is not uncommon to see patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease who have been placed in typical devices prescribed for the more common forefoot varus. However, the medial posting provided inappropriately under the foot of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth patient is not only unhelpful, but can actually worsen the deformity and contribute to ankle instability. The ideal combination, in my view, is a soft device worn in an athletic shoe--a combination readily accepted by an adolescent with the disorder. Prescription and fabrication of the correct device usually decreases the amount of wear and breakdown of the shoe, which at times is the presenting complaint. Patients may require a high-top design in their shoe wear to better control the foot inside the shoe.
<P>Conservative treatment becomes difficult when the deformities progress to a stage of extreme rigidity, and surgery becomes the only alternative. Unfortunately, these patients often migrate into the arena of the worst of all possible worlds with the development of sensory neuropathy overlying their rigid cavus. Surgical reconstruction of these patients can be fraught with complications, and the outcome of the procedures are difficult to assess. In patients who develop the disease early, the importance of appropriate shoes and orthotic devices cannot be overemphasized since the patients improve their function and level of comfort dramatically. Counseling concerning career choices appropriate to anticipated functional level should be undertaken as well. The alert practitioner can dramatically reduce the symptoms of these patients by providing appropriate shoes, foot orthoses, and braces. More importantly, conservative care of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth patient may postpone the need for surgery and prevent injury.

<H1>Contact Digitizing</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
</CENTER>
<P>By the next century, plaster casting may be a relic. But will the world adopt laser scanning as its successor, or some other form of automated foot measurement? Today, laser scanners are viewed as the wave of the future. No doubt, images of patients beaming up to meet their orthosis are invoked when the snazzy notion of laser scanning is mentioned. But laser scanners are used by fewer than three dozen practitioners in America. In fact, the most widely adopted form of orthotic automation is not waiting in the future. It is already present. Contact digitizing has been around for almost 10 years. Its dominant purveyor is a company called Amfit Medical which is almost universally considered the pioneer in foot orthosis automation by virtue of its FootFax digitizer. Indeed, Amfit owns the contact digitizing field. 
<P>FootFax operates in hundreds of offices across a variety of professions from pedorthics to podiatry to physical therapy to orthopedics. Because Amfit markets aggressively to all members of the biomechanics mainstream and even to qualified commercial establishments (such as shoe stores associated with pedorthic clinics), the company enjoys hundreds of installations. That means an experience base of thousands of patient prescriptions. Compare that to podiatry-based laser systems which are just now breaking into other fields.
<P>Moreover,  the Amfit network of facilities extends globally. The company's installed base overseas is busy expanding mini networks abroad which are headquartered on one continent with branches on another. The concept of global orthoses (<A HREF="/biomech/mar96/auto.html"><I>Global Orthoses,</I></A> March) is a present day reality for Amfit. One day earlier this year, in Las Vegas, I personally witnessed some of Amfit's rapid international expansion as the operator of an extensive network in Israel talked about expanding into Italy. Indeed, because of its head start, not only is  the FootFax the leading automated system today, it may also be the world leader in automated orthoses years into the next century. 
<P>Contact digitizing operates on a simple concept. The patient steps or places his foot upon a measuring surface in a weightbearing or semi-weightbearing position either while standing or seated. Generally, the patient has one weighted foot on the floor, and the other on the platform. Controlled air pressure pushes up 576 piston posts against the plantar surface, much as those novelties that duplicate a three-dimensional object by surrounding it with pins. FootFax posts--tiny, dull posts 4mm in width--form the three-dimensional intermediary impression prerequisite to any custom device. 
<P>The benefits of the process allow for some shortcuts that plaster and optical scanners can't offer. According to Amfit's Tony Tadin, when the impression is taken in a weightbearing or semi-weightbearing position, the practitioner can make immediate adjustments, such as a wedge for the medial heel, and place the foot back on the device. Not only can the patient "feel" the plastic pins and give feedback about comfort, says Tadin, but the practitioner can see firsthand if the alignment is correct. Despite this contention by Amfit, plastic pins feel nothing like an orthosis, and it is doubtful that any patient input during measurement would reflect the true comfort of the finished orthosis.
<P>The practitioner can view the entire two-dimensional image on a computer monitor and make the corrections to a 3D image of the device on the screen, using the system's Windows-based software. The process becomes truly interactive as the provider modifies the device from the keyboard according to both patient comments and the provider's therapeutic experience. Once final, the information is transmitted back to Amfit for fabrication or to an on-site miller.
<P>When using counterparts such as optical scanners or plaster, the impression is taken in a non-weightbearing position, and the arch is high, says Tadin. Scanner makers, however, argue that by using glass surfaces against the foot, they can create a weightbearing impression. Tadin rejects the notion that glass will create an authentic weightbearing impression. Tadin also says that the practitioner cannot make automatic adjustments in real time, but only on the screen preparatory to fabrication.
<P>The device fabricated by Amfit is an EVA-based product. Many will argue that these devices are not functional, but rather accommodative. Amfit and many of its users disagree. They staunchly maintain that their device can be both accommodative and functional. And in truth, to call Amfit's appliance accommodative is an oversimplification that does a disservice to any professional's understanding of orthotic materials. Yes, it is made of EVA-based product, easily carved by Amfit's proprietary miller. Yes, it is often prescribed for diabetics, arthritic patients and others who need accommodation. But the judge of whether any device is accommodative or functional is not in the materials selected, but rather in the practitioner's prescription and the device's density. A FootFax device is dense enough to control, depending on the foot, the prescription, the thickness, and the weight of the patient. (By the way, Amfit devices are among the ones I wear regularly.)
<P>A major point of contention for <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> is Amfit's claim that its system is, in fact, a scanning device. FootFax is a reliable state-of-the-art system, but it is not a scanner because scanning implies electronic measurement in the absence of contact, according to the parlance of the electronic scanning community. However, it is important to note that Amfit's system only produces the specified EVA-based Amfit orthosis. Laser scanners break through that limitation. Their images can yield a device in any material, including cork and leather, as John Bergmann, DPM, is so fond of saying, especially if an intermediary wax step is used. Amfit counters that while its central fabrication plant offers only the EVA-based product, users who do their own milling do create a positive mold for vacuum forming any material. 
<P>Amfit is an important automation system for any office. Indeed, what the future does hold in store for lasers vs. contact digitizers is not an either/or situation, but both operating side by side in the same setting.

<H1>Orthotic Applications for Carbon Fiber</H1>
<P><I>by Donald T. Weldon, C.Ped</I>
</CENTER>
<P>Consider the virtues of carbon fiber: A sheet only 1 to 3 mm thick has the strength of a 3/16-inch thick piece of polypropylene. Moreover, it can be manufactured into almost any thickness or shape. Carbon fiber is available in pre-laminated sheets of different thicknesses, or in the form of fabrics suitable for custom lamination. A sheet of carbon fiber can be heated to specifications, then vaccuformed over a positive mold. Once cooled, it can be trimmed, sanded, and buffed like plastic. Flexible carbon-fiber fabric can be layered over a positive mold with fiberglass or a regular stockinette and a PVA bag, then laminated under vacuum with an acrylic resin. Once set, it too can be sanded and buffed to the desired design. These versatile characteristics of carbon fiber make it especially well suited for a number of orthotic applications.
<P>Remember, though, that since carbon is a known carcinogen, a respirator and safety glasses should be worn at all times when finishing carbon fiber. Each supplier should have a material safety data sheet that discusses the do's and don'ts of using carbon fiber and any additional precautions that should be taken when handling this material.

<H2>Forefoot Joint Diseases</H2> 
Hallux rigidus, hallux limitus, and "turf toe" are all disorders of the first metatarsal-phalangeal joint. Whether a hyperextension injury or a joint deformity, these disorders all present with similar symptoms, especially pain at the dorsal joint when dorsiflexing the big toe. Managing these disorders involves restricting the amount of joint dorsiflexion without affecting normal gait. 
<P>Rigid plastic orthoses with a great toe extension, extended steel shanks, stiff-soled shoes, and rigid rocker-bottom shoes are effective therapeutic measures and are still widely used. Most, however, require a shoe size change or extensive shoe modification. 
<P>If carbon fiber is used, all of the above  mentioned techniques can be applied without increasing shoe size or making extensive shoe modifications. The orthosis design also can be customized to the patient's foot to address other possible foot pathologies. 
<P>The orthosis, manufactured in various thicknesses depending on the patient's requirements, restricts first metatarsal-phalangeal joint motion with a distal great toe extension. This great toe extension projects from the first metatarsal-phalangeal joint distally to the end of the toe, and is dorsiflexed between 9 and 18 degrees for normal gait. The lateral trim of the carbon fiber is just proximal to the lesser metatarsals. The orthosis is trimmed to the insole size of the patient's accommodative footwear. 
<P>Using the same type of trimlines, a custom laminated carbon-fiber orthosis can be manufactured with any necessary modifications, such as a metatarsal raise or a longitudinal arch support. 

<H2>Midfoot Joint Disease</H2>
Midfoot degenerative joint disease elicits pain on excessive rotation, the collapse of the tarsal-metatarsal region, or both. The goal of orthotic management is to support the foot and to remove the painful forces. To do this, a cast is made of the foot in its optimal position.  Maintaining as close to a normal structure as possible, a positive mold is then made from the cast.  A custom, total-contact foot orthosis is fabricated with the material of choice. Before the posting material is added, a thin carbon fiber layer is vaccuum-formed from just proximal to the metatarsal heads back to the heel. The carbon-fiber layer stabilizes the heel as well as the longitudinal arch and mid-foot. This design and material combination also help to reduce excessive rotation and collapse.

<H2>Jones Fracture</H2>
Jones fracture is managed by stopping the lateral deviation and plantar flexion of the fifth metatarsal. I have found that a custom-laminated Jones fracture carbon-fiber orthosis works well in this dual role. A UCBL-type cast provides all the foot structure needed to fabricate this orthosis. The trimlines are just proximal to the fifth metatarsal head, over the dorsum of the fifth metatarsal, along the heel medially and laterally (cupping it), and along the center portion of the plantar surface of the foot.
<P>Fabrication is easiest in a lamination jig. Start with a PVA bag over the positive mold. Then add layers of the following: a cotton stockinette, carbon-fiber fabric (concentrated in an area slightly larger than the trimlines), a fiberglass stockinette, carbon fiber fabric, a fiberglass stockinette, carbon fiber fabric, a cotton stockinette, and a second PVA bag. Combine an acrylic resin and hardener and, under vacuum, pour the resin into the second PVA bag to saturate the carbon fiber and stockinette layers. The resin can be worked by hand or by a stringing technique to ensure uniform saturation. This process yields a 3 mm thick orthosis.  Depending on the patient's activity level and size, you may need to make the orthosis thicker. If so, add another layer of carbon-fiber fabric and a stockinette before applying the second PVA bag. After the resin has hardened, the orthosis can be cut to the trimlines with a cast saw and finished by sanding and buffing.

<H2>Disorders of the Posterior Tibial Tendon</H2>
Depending on the severity of the problem, posterior tibial tendon maladies may require surgery, an ankle foot orthosis, or shoe modifications. If posterior tibial tendon management requires a UCBL orthosis, a fabricated custom carbon-fiber orthosis can be a good alternative to the standard plastic one. The advantage is that the orthosis is mechanically stable yet, instead of 3/16-inch thick, it is only 3 mm thick, allowing the orthosis to be worn in more of the patient's shoes, such as athletic, golf, oxfords, and some loafer designs. 
<P>Processes of casting, modifying, and fabricating carbon-fiber UCBL orthoses are identical to those of plastic ones. A prefabricated carbon-fiber laminated sheet is used for vacuum forming, which can be accomplished easily on a vacuum platter. After the necessary modifications are made, the positive mold is placed on the vacuum platter with the plantar surface of the foot facing up. Before cutting the pre-laminated sheet of carbon fiber, check the manufacturer's cutting and heating specifications. 
<P>Cut a piece of material large enough to cover normal UCBL trimlines. Heat the material to the desired temperature and moldability. Place it over the mold and stretch the vacuum platter to seal and to allow carbon to form around the positive mold shape. Allow the sheet to cool completely to retain its contours, then cut, trim, and finish it as you would a plastic UCBL orthosis. 
<P>One disadvantage of this fabrication process is adjustability. If, while trying to heat-flare the carbon fiber, it becomes too hot, the carbon-fiber layers can delaminate, causing it to lose strength and possibly to fracture.
<P>Carbon-fiber also can be incorporated into a rigid rocker sole or an extended steel-shank shoe modification. The shoe is modified the same way as if using a standard steel shank, except that the steel shank is replaced by carbon fiber strips. This modification is lighter and just as effective as a steel shank.
<P>Orthotic technicians also use prefabricated carbon sheets when attaching a caliper plate to a combination last shoe. A small plate inside the shoe is used as a riveting surface when the shoe does not have an adequate shank.
<P>There are many uses for carbon fiber in the design and manufacture of orthoses. When purchasing carbon fiber, whether it be prefabricated sheets or fabric, keep in mind that each supplier's material may vary slightly, and may have specific fabrication and heating requirements. Be sure to ask for these requirements when ordering your material.

<H1>The Diabetic Athlete
<BR>Part Two</H1>
<P><I>by Martin W. Sandala, DPM</I>
</CENTER>
<P>The hypoglycemic effects of exercise can be highly therapeutic for patients with either non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) or insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM). Precisely because of its hypoglycemic effects, however, exercise can increase the risk of a frightening phenomenon known as post-exercise hypoglycemia, delayed onset, or PEHDO in people with IDDM. These "delayed" hypoglycemic reactions occur after the exercise period is over--sometimes from five to 15 hours later. PEHDO episodes most frequently are nocturnal, severe (possibly resulting in the loss of consciousness and/or seizures), and commonly occur after a single episode of exercise in individuals who do not regularly exercise. Athletes attempting to increase their level of conditioning also are at a greater risk. 
<P>The possibility of PEHDO often is enough to discourage patients with diabetes from becoming involved in a regular exercise program. Fortunately, PEHDO can be prevented. One key to prevention is fostering in the patient a solid understanding of how and under what circumstances PEHDO is likely to occur. Another is helping the patient to make the appropriate adjustments to his or her diabetes care regimen, be it through dietary interventions, adjusting the athlete's level of activity or insulin dosage, or a combination of these.
<P>The causes of hypoglycemic episodes are multifactoral and may include the following: 
<P><B><I>Depletion of Liver and Muscle Glycogen.</I></B> In diabetic individuals, the utilization of stored glycogen and free fatty acids by working muscles is similar to that of non-diabetic individuals: During the first few moments of exercise, muscle glycogen is the primary source of energy for muscle contraction, followed by glucose circulating in the blood. Then, the liver releases its stores of glycogen. But because of the impaired ability of diabetics to produce and/or use insulin effectively, the major influence of even brief exercise sessions (40 minutes) for individuals with diabetes, in terms of how much glycogen is used up, has been compared with that of prolonged exercise (4 hours) in non-diabetic individuals.
<P>The replacement of liver and muscle glycogen stores after exercise is completed by a continuation of increased blood glucose uptake by muscles and the liver, which contributes to delayed onset hypoglycemia. The replenishment of muscle glycogen stores may take as long as 12-24 hours after exercise. Liver glycogen stores may take 24-48 hours to be replenished. 
<P><B><I>Increased Insulin Sensitivity.</I></B> Exercise increases the body's sensitivity to insulin in both non-diabetic and diabetic individuals. So in certain individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, their common dose of insulin would have a greater blood glucose lowering effect under the influence of exercise. In one study involving teenagers with IDDM, exercising for a period of 12 weeks, three times per week, caused a 23 percent increase in the body's sensitivity to insulin.  
<P><B><I>Abnormal Counter-Regulation.</I></B> The body's biochemical response to hypoglycemia is termed <I>counter-regulation</I>, and includes an increase in the secretion of glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol, the hormones responsible for increasing hepatic glucose production. Glucagon is the key hormone responsible for recovery from hypoglycemia. Epinephrine becomes important when glucagon is deficient, but normally is not as critical a factor as the other two. Seventy-five percent of the diabetic individuals in one study had a decreased response of several counter-regulatory hormones, compared to non-diabetic controls. This point reinforces the fact that the body's natural recovery mechanism from hypoglycemia is deficient in diabetics. 
<P><B><I>Individual Diabetes Management Program.</I></B> An individual's diabetes management program also may contribute to the PEHDO phenomenon. The amount and type of insulin used, the scheduling of exercise and insulin compared with the timing and the composition of meals and snacks, have been shown to be quite significant.
<P>The first step to preventing PEHDO reactions is to recognize that the possibility exists. Healthcare professionals must properly inform patients about this possibility before encouraging them to exercise. Other considerations include: 

<UL><B>Blood glucose monitoring.</B> Frequent monitoring is essential, particularly in the evening, and even during the night following unusually stressful exercise or competitive events.</UL>
<UL><B>Exercise.</B> Patients must learn to recognize their own intensity of effort and duration of the physical activity in which they participate. Patients should be advised to exercise at about the same time every day and at roughly the same intensity. Any changes should be made gradually and potentially be offset by changes in food intake (either before or after the exercise session) and/or insulin dosage. Moreover, patients should be instructed to more closely monitor their blood sugar levels during these periods of transition to determine the effect of exercise duration and intensity on blood sugar.</UL>
<UL><B>Meals and Snacks.</B> Ingestion of a pre-exercise snack, as well as moderate amounts of glucose during exercise activity, appear to have a sparing effect on stored liver and muscle glycogen. The contents of the snack are important too. In one study, whole milk was found to produce a delayed rise in increased blood glucose concentrations without an increased blood glucose value during exercise, while orange juice and skim milk were more rapidly absorbed and caused increased blood glucose during exercise. Whole milk, therefore, was a more effective pre-exercise snack than orange juice in preventing post-exercise hypoglycemia. Comparatively, orange juice and skim milk may be more advantageous when used as a postexercise snack. Carbohydrate composition adjustments are particularly important when considering spontaneous activity, where insulin already has been given and therefore cannot be adjusted.</UL>
<UL><B>Insulin Dosage and Injection Site.</B> When strenuous activity or exercise is planned for, insulin levels may need to be adjusted to decrease the risk of hypoglycemic episodes. It may be necessary to further decrease or eliminate insulin in the evening to guard against middle-of-the-night PEHDO.
<P>The insulin injection site is also important. If the insulin is injected into a particularly active area, such as a thigh or buttocks, increased blood flow to that region during exercise will cause excess insulin to be "washed out" and distributed throughout the body. It would be far wiser, prior to an exercise event, to choose an injection site such as the fatty pad around the abdomen, an inactive area where release would be absorbed more slowly into the blood stream.</UL>
<P>To prevent postexercise hypoglycemia, patients and treating professionals must make short and long range commitments to understanding the diabetic condition and be willing make the necessary lifestyle adjustments required for tight glucose control. An understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes and the effects of diet and exercise on blood glucose regulation is absolutely essential for diabetic athletes.

<A HREF="/biomech/apr96/"><IMG SRC="/biomech/biomech.gif" WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=48 ALT="BioMechanics logo"></A>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Aquatic Therapy</B></FONT SIZE>
<H1>Treatment for Patients with Lower Extremity Total Joint Replacement</H1>
<P><I>by Ann L. Charness, PT</I>
</CENTER>
<P>Each year thousands of Americans undergo total joint replacements at the hip or knee. Typically, these patients have degenerative joint disease (DJD), usually arthritis, with chronic and often disabling pain that limits their activities. 
<P>The main problems following total hip or total knee joint replacement (THR/TKR) include wound healing, limited range of motion, weakness, pain, edema, decreased joint proprioception, limited functional mobility, limited ability to participate in self-care and daily living activities, and physical deconditioning. Inactivity produces deleterious effects on muscle strength and endurance, bone density, coordination and reflex responses, connective tissue extensibility, and cardiovascular fitness.

<H2>Total Hip Joint Replacement</H2>
Before using the aquatic environment for exercise following a THR, first and foremost patients should be evaluated to determine if they have any contraindications to exercise in water. These contraindications include open wounds which cannot be covered with a bio-occlusive dressing, skin infection, incontinence of bowel and/or bladder, systemic infectious disease with fever or 100 degrees Fahrenheit, cardiac failure, respiratory disease with severe compromise of vital capacity, uncontrolled blood pressure both hypotension and hypertension, uncontrolled seizures, and presence of intravenous lines (heplocks, hickman lines) and masogastric tubes. Patients with any of the relative contraindications such as angina, repeated syncope, feeding tubes, tracheostomies, and absent cough reflex should be considered on an individual basis.
<P>Secondly, the issue of bio-occulsive dressing must be addressed. When considering which dressing to use the therapist should check the type of disinfection system used in the therapy pool. Some dressings that work well with a chlorine disinfection system do not maintain a tight seal when a bromine disinfection system is used. 
<P>The therapist must decide when to begin the aquatic therapy program. While some facilities begin pool therapy as soon as the patient is medically stable and out of bed--even with sutures or staples in place--other facilities wait until the staples are removed and the wound has closed superficially. The decision rests with the physician and with the resources for wound management available in the pool therapy department.
<P>Since they influence transfer into the pool and the exercise that can be done within, hip precautions are another consideration. Typically, patients with hip precautions have restrictions on hip flexion adduction and rotation range. If the patient is not permitted to flex the hip beyond 60 to 70 degrees, transfer into the pool in a seated position may not be possible and a stretcher lift may be indicated. Similarly, the patient may need to exercise on a stretcher hooked on to the side of the pool to maintain joint alignment, especially in the early post-operative stages. If hip flexion is limited to less than 90 degrees, the patient can't perform some of the basic safety skills such as supine or prone float and recovery and turning from supine to prone and vice versa. Hip abduction can be maintained by placing a wedge float between the legs. The therapist should know if the hip prosthesis has been cemented in place or if a porous system with holes to accommodate bone growth with healing was used. The therapist should always check with the physician for the percentage of body weight that the client is allowed to place through the prosthetic joint. This influences the depth of water necessary for upright exercise or ambulation. Similarly, the therapist should know which approach was used to perform the hip replacement and whether or not the trochanter was removed.
<P>The goals of treatment for a patient with a THR include posture correction, restoration of range of motion--especially hip extension--strengthening the musculature critical for functional mobility and ambulation, specifically the hip extensors and abductors as well as the quadriceps, edema reduction, pain management, and functional training including transfers and ambulations, and physical conditioning.
<P>Postural correction activities include but are not limited to stretches to restore hip and knee extension range, abdominal strengthening, training in lumbopelvic cervicothoracic and scapular stabilization, and strengthening to the back extensors. Activities that can be used include pelvic bracing in supine and prone, supported bridging, abdominal crunches, isometric trunk exercises in lying using Bad Ragaz trunk patterns, suspended trunk stabilization both statically and with upper and/or lower extremity movement, assisted thoracic extension and stabilization while doing arm activities sitting in chin deep water, arm pull downs sitting in chin deep water maintaining a neutral spine, lower extremity exercises standing poolside maintaining a neutral pelvis, and walking maintaining a neutral pelvis. Breathing exercises would be incorporated with any of the above.
<P>Hip and knee range and strength can be restored using any one or combination of the following activities that fall within the patient's hip precautions and weightbearing restrictions. Suspended cycling (watching height of knees), marching in place (watching height of knees), and gentle swing throughs are all appropriate hip mobility and strengthening exercises for the patient who is non-weightbearing. The Bad Ragaz lower extremity patterns can be done either isometrically or isotonically for both hip range and lumbopelvifemoral stabilization. Buoyancy supported hip abduction and adduction to neutral can be done in supported supine as can the Bad Ragaz pattern of hip extension-abduction with the body moving away from the limb fixed by the therapist. Terminal knee extension can be performed in supported supine with a float under the knee. Flutter kicking can be practiced initially with the patient in supported prone, progressing to standing with upper extremity support poolside with the hips flexed to 90 degrees once hip precautions have been removed. Standing poolside with a neutral spine, the patient can do hip abduction and extension.
<P>Transfers from sit to stand and vice versa can be started early with the patient seated in chin deep water. The buoyancy lift with the patient in the vertical position facilitates this transfer. Placing the arms on a kick board in front of the patient can promote forward inclination of the trunk, an essential component of assuming the upright position.
<P>A progressive ambulation program can begin with the patient walking slowly in water up to the sternal notch in as streamlined a posture as possible. Initially, the therapist may have to hold the patient's hands. Resistance to forward motion is increased by making the body less streamlined (e.g., walking holding a kick board, walking with fins on the feet, etc.) and/or by accelerating the walking speed. Side stepping leading with the operated leg strengthens the hip abductors. Side stepping leading with the uninvolved leg may promote too much hip adduction for the patient with hip precautions. Walking backwards is useful for strengthening the hip extensors as long as the patient maintains a neutral spine. Advanced ambulation exercises include braiding, and walking in circles or around a figure of eight. Walking and changing directions is more challenging due to the turbulence it produces and the resistance to movement.
<P>Independent swimming should not be attempted until hip precautions are discontinued because the recovery from both supine or prone requires hip flexion to a minimum of 90 degrees. Prone strokes where the hips are extended (e.g., front crawl) are preferable to those that require significant hip and knee flexion (e.g., breast, elementary back, or side strokes), since hip and knee flexion contractures are more prevalent than extension ones. As an alternative the patient can be instructed to use a flutter kick while doing arm movements of the breast or elementary back strokes. Swimming should be considered as a follow-up to the rehabilitation program as a component of a lifelong commitment to physical fitness and cardio-respiratory conditioning.
<H2>Total Knee Replacement</H2>
Many of the issues already discussed are relevant for the patient who has undergone a TKR. The therapist is urged to consider contraindications to aquatic therapy when referring a patient with TKR for exercise in the pool. Similarly, the therapist should determine if the bio-occlusive dressing used in the facility will hold a seal in the pool's chemical disinfection system.
<P>Patients who have undergone a TKR usually are referred to the aquatic therapy program earlier than patients who have had a THR. Unlike the THR patient who has hip precautions and mobility restrictions, the patient with a TKR has no mobility restrictions other than rotation of the tibia on the femur. In fact, it is imperative to restore a minimum of 90 degrees of active knee flexion and full active knee extension within the first month following the knee replacement. In addition, the patient who has had a TKR is usually cleared for weightbearing to tolerance immediately postoperatively, and patients who have had the knee prosthesis cemented into place are often cleared to ambulate without crutches or a walker 3-4 weeks postoperatively. The therapist should determine if the patient's prosthesis has been cemented into place, since the patient with a cemented prosthesis can be pushed a little harder and faster in therapy.
<P>The goals of therapy for the patient following a TKR include posture correction, restoration of range of motion--especially knee flexion and extension--strengthening the quadriceps (and to a lesser degree the hip extensors and abductors essential for functional mobility and ambulation), reduction of edema, pain management, functional mobility training, and physical conditioning. 
<P>The following activities can be performed suspended with flotation devices in deep water: bicycling, marching in place, high knee marching in place, lower extremity swing throughs, jogging, and treading water. The supported supine position can be used for terminal knee extension with a float under the involved knee, bridging, buoyancy supported hip abduction and adduction, and for many of the lower extremity Bad Ragaz patterns, especially those emphasizing flexing the knee under the body. The patient can work on pushing the body away from the side of the pool while in the recumbent position, thus encouraging knee flexion mobility and close-chain hip and knee extension strengthening. The patient can stand at the side of the pool and perform single or two joint hamstring stretches, the former with hip flexion with a flotation device under the knee, and the latter with the hip flexed and a float attached to the foot. This stretch position also can be used as the starting position for buoyancy-resisted hip extension exercises with the knee extended. The patient can also perform hip abduction-adduction and hip flexion-extension activities standing at poolside.
<P>Wall slides at the side of the pool can strengthen the quadriceps mechanism closed chain in preparation for transfers from sit to stand and vice versa. The "cube position" is also useful for training closed chain control of the quadriceps. In this position, the patient sits on the therapist's knee with a neutral spine and balanced pelvis while the therapist assumes the half kneel position behind. (The therapist's back leg is braced and the knee does not contact the ground). Activities that can be done in the cube position include, but are not limited to, arm pull downs, shoulder horizontal abduction and adduction with scapular retraction and protraction respectively, and lower extremity weight shifts with static hold progressing to weight shifts with dynamic activity of the unloaded limb.
<P>Assuming and maintaining the half kneel position midpool is used in preparation for training transfers from floor (half kneel) to standing and vice versa. In the half kneel position, the patient's back leg is braced and the knee is not in contact with the ground. Patients can be trained to perform progressive resistive lifting while maintaining a neutral spine midpool.
<P>While the ambulation program for patients with a TKR is essentially the same as for patients following THR, high stepping and toe/heel walking can be added. Weight shift and lumbopelvic stabilization are emphasized throughout the gait training program. The transition to gait training in shallower water can be started earlier than for patients following THR. Woolfenden (1994) suggests that a progression for ambulation in shallow water includes walking holding onto the side of the pool, progressing to walking holding onto the therapist's hands, to walking with the arms supported on a kickboard on either side to increase trunk stability, and finally to walking freely. Balance exercises should be incorporated into the aquatic therapy program once the patient is ambulating in waist deep water. A common sequence is to take three steps forward and then balance on one leg, and to take three steps forward and change directions. Training on stairs is easier in the pool because of the buoyancy weight relief. The elevation training program should begin in deep water and progress to more shallow water as the strength of the hip and knee extensors increases.

<H1>Treating Flatfoot</H1>
<P><I>by Eric Lauf, DPM</I>
</CENTER>

<P>The anatomical architecture of the foot is similar to building blocks: When assembled properly, the blocks are uniquely capable of supporting extreme loads for extended periods of time. People with high arched feet (pes cavus) can carry great loads due to the inherent stability of the architecture of that foot type. People with flat feet (pes planus), on the other hand, may develop arch pain and/or pain to the inner aspects of their ankles due to a collapse of their feet and an inability of their foot type to support their weight. This causes an overuse syndrome to the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and plantar fascial bands which support the arch, resulting in plantar fasciitis, posterior tibial tendinitis, and a host of other problems.
<P>Orthotic foot supports provide excellent accommodation for the flatfooted patient, limiting pronation and extrinsically supporting the arch against the demands placed on it. A well-chosen prefabricated orthosis often can provide the needed arch support at a much lower cost than custom orthoses, for both children and adults. 
<P>Pes planus may be congenital with instability present from birth. Acquired flat foot deformities usually are due to trauma in which the posterior tibial tendon is ruptured or otherwise becomes dysfunctional, resulting in a sudden flattening of the arch and weakness of the foot with subsequent pain. Acquired flat foot deformities are often very disabling and in my view, often require surgical intervention combined with orthoses.
<P>While shoes are not necessary until weightbearing is initiated during early childhood, the formative years, ages 18 months through age 14, present a significant need for external support during the development of the internal architecture of the arch. It is my view that, contrary to the belief of some, the musculotendinous, ligamentous, and bony architecture of the foot are ill defined and soft. These soft structures, combined with hard weightbearing surfaces, such as concrete, serve as a deforming force that will adversely affect the development of the arch.
<P>From ages 7 through 14, children experience the same difficulties with their feet as adults, with one other notable variant: The immature nature of the growing foot combined with the softer more easily damaged growth plates potentiates an increased propensity toward bruising of the foot (predominantly the heel and forefoot) during increased running, jumping, and athletic endeavors such as soccer. 
<P>Adult foot deformities usually are a mixed bag, varying with age, weight, and the physical demands placed on the foot. Occupations that necessitate prolonged standing and walking potentiate fatigue and discomfort to the foot. Combining long work hours with the additional demands of aerobic exercise further adds to foot stress. Prefabricated orthoses will resist these adverse factors when combined with a well-constructed, cushioned, and supportive shoe.
<P>The goal of an orthosis is to provide arch support and limit excessive pronation, thereby decreasing stress. Devices that are effective in limiting excessive pronation also reduce excessive internal rotation of the leg, thigh, and hip and decrease stress to the knee, hip joint, and lower back, often enhancing comfort to the entire lower extremity. In the child, orthoses are effective in limiting the excessive pronation that occurs with flat-footed deformities, thereby compensating for the lack of structural integrity of the foot. With increased arch support, these children usually experience less fatigue, which enables them to engage in functional and athletic activities with greater endurance and fewer complaints in general. In the adult, orthotic support compensates for a flat-footed deformity by providing additional support for the arch. This decreases stress to the plantar fascia and minimizes the frequency and magnitude of plantar fasciitis and heel spur syndrome. Stress is also decreased to the forefoot, reducing metatarsalgia, sesamoiditis, and other similar maladies. 
<P> Although a soft orthosis may appear to be desirable to soothe a sore foot, often a more rigid device with some inherent flexibility provides the most benefit. A more rigid arch support will inherently be better able to support the foot, a person's body weight and the demands of work or exercise that are placed on it. A soft device, which provides little arch support, will not decrease stress and strain to the plantar fascia or muscular tendinous structures that traverse the arch. 
<P>While prefabricated arch supports, including a variety of heel pads and overlay cushions for the arch (such as Spencos) traditionally have provided cushion, many of today's prefabricated supports provide increased rigidity and even graphite for extra support. Devices that are thin yet supportive under moderate weight usually are the most effective. The carbon composite Graphite, when incorporated into an orthosis, is a strong yet thin and lightweight material that is very supportive. Currently it is the standard by which all other materials should be measured, in my view. The traditional Dr. Scholl's insert is of little value in that it is a piece of flat, synthetic material designed to simulate leather in an arch support, which easily compresses under minimal weight.
<P>Prefabricated orthoses usually vary in price from $10 to $50, compared to $250 to almost $500 for a custom orthosis. One major drawback to prefabs: as all feet are structurally different, obtaining an accurate fit is sometimes more difficult with prefab supports. 
<P>When considering a prefabricated device for your patients with pes planus, select one of good quality and advise your patient to purchase one that is fit well to his or her foot. Recommend that your patient try it on while in the store, if possible, to ensure that the mold of the support conforms to the overall architecture of the foot. Remind your patient that it may take some time to get used to the orthosis.
<P>In summary, prefabricated orthoses often are beneficial to assess the ability of an arch support to decrease the discomfort to the foot on a temporary cost-effective basis. Devices that are firmly supportive yet light and thin will be better tolerated and more effective than devices that are not. If significant relief from discomfort occurs, often no further treatment will be necessary. If additional support is desired, the decision for a custom-made device is more easily made due to the initial positive experience found with a pre-made device.

<H1>Clinical Gait Laboratories: How Are We Doing?</H1>
<P><I>by Christopher Vaughan, PhD; Diane Damiano, PhD, PT; and Mark Abel, MD</I>
</CENTER>
<P>The past decade has seen a rapid expansion in the number of clinical gait laboratories in the U.S. But like all medical services in the age of healthcare reform, those provided by gait laboratories are subject to close scrutiny. In this vein, we discuss the current and projected status of clinical gait laboratories in today's rapidly evolving healthcare environment. We have chosen as the starting point for our article a letter written by Brand and Crowninshield in the <CITE>Journal of Biomechanics</CITE> (1981). They argued that any patient evaluation tool would be useful if, and only if, the technique met six criteria. Fifteen years later, we will address these six criteria in light of the current status of gait labs and add four requirements of our own. 
<P><B><I>1. The measured parameter must correlate well with the patient's functional capacity.</I></B> Literally hundreds of parameters, such as ground reaction forces, muscle, and joint motions could be used in a gait report. The key issue, though, is which, if any, of these parameters says anything meaningful about the patient's musculoskeletal function. Another legitimate concern is the degree to which a gait study, which traditionally focuses just on level walking, correlates with the patient's other activities of daily living. At the University of Virginia we have addressed this issue by incorporating the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM)--a validated and repeatable method to assess a variety of functional tasks--as a part of our standard evaluation of patients with cerebral palsy. The strong linear relationship seen between GMFM scores and gait kinematic parameters adds considerable support to the assumption that gait function is indicative of performance on other motor tasks. Furthermore, we have found that gait parameters correlate with the level of motor impairment in cerebral palsy.
<P><B><I>2. The measurements must not be directly observable or semi-quantifiable by the physician or therapist.</I></B> It has been argued by some that gait laboratories are superfluous, and that surgical decisions can be made on the basis of an experienced clinician's visual observations. The inference is that gait labs are geared towards research and have a limited role to play in the practice of "real" medicine. We would argue that there are a host of important parameters that even the experienced physician cannot see. Take, for example, the electromyographic activity in the calf muscles in a child with spastic hemiplegia: Is it the tibialis anterior or posterior causing the equinovarus deformity of the foot? Only fine-wire electromyographic information can clarify the answer. Although a video recording of a person's gait still exerts a powerful effect on the clinician, interpretation based on this alone may be insufficient since the clinician can focus on only a single plane or even a single joint within that plane at any given time. Additionally, when gait variables are quantifiable, treatment interventions can be judged against objective measures rather than observational or subjective methods. This closer scrutiny of outcome will better define indications for interventions and is mandated by our current environment of healthcare cost containment.
<P><B><I>3. The measured parameters must clearly distinguish between normal and abnormal.</I></B> Although differences from normal can be demonstrated with gait parameters, it is difficult to identify precisely where the primary abnormality lies. One example is the velocity-dependence of all kinematic and kinetic parameters. Fourier transformation, a mathematical technique that has the ability to perform a spectral analysis of cyclic data, has a certain appeal when studying gait. Some researchers showed that this approach could be applied to the ground reaction force and used to distinguish patients with knee arthritis from normals. However, we conducted a similar study and demonstrated that normal subjects walking slowly had coefficients identical to those of patients with arthritis. One of the great difficulties when starting a new gait laboratory is to find a database of normal parameters that can be used for comparison with patients. Recognizing that many of the parameters are lab-and equipment-specific, we recently completed a study of more than 80 normal children that we intend to publish on CD-ROM.
<P><B><I>4. The measurement  technique must not significantly alter the performance of the evaluated activity.</I></B> This, of course, is the biomechanical equivalent of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in experimental physics, which states that a phenomenon is altered even by the process of studying it. It might reasonably be argued that the mere fact a patient is in the artificial environment of a lab will lead to a distorted "clinic gait." We have found, however, that most patients will settle down very well after a short period of acclimatization. Of more concern, however, are those studies in which the patient is festooned with cables and electrodes and tied to the base computer by an umbilical cord of trailing cables. Small, passive markers and telemeterized EMG systems have tended to minimize this problem. The degree of patient encumbrance is far less a problem than it was a decade ago.
<P><B><I>5. The measurements must be accurate and reproducible.</I></B> Many would concede that this criterion goes without saying. Surprisingly, however, few studies have examined the issues of accuracy and reproducibility in a systematic and rigorous manner. While some work has shown that temporal-distance factors and vertical ground reaction forces are reproducible and accurate in normal and handicapped subjects, few published studies have looked at kinematics (e.g., joint moments) and even fewer have concentrated on kinetics (e.g., joint movements). What is the reason for this lack of self-scrutiny? Perhaps it is because such studies are thought to be "boring" and unlikely to be considered favorably by funding agencies. Alternatively, it may be that gait lab personnel are afraid they will discover just how inaccurate and variable their data are. Despite these concerns, it behooves us all as serious scientists to address this important issue in the future and to publish the results in the peer-reviewed archival literature.
<P><B><I>6. The results must be communicated in a form which is readily identifiable in a physical or physiological analogue.</I></B> One of the exciting aspects about biomechanics, particularly in the context of the gait laboratory, is that it brings together the fields of engineering and medicine. Engineers have developed many of the instruments and algorithms that generate the gait parameters. However, physicians and therapists must use these data to make clinical decisions. Companies responsive to the needs of clinicians have been most successful in developing equipment and methods of data presentation to enhance the decision-making process. A good example is the implementation of computer animation techniques to show ground reaction forces, muscle activity, and skeletal kinematics.
<P><B><I>7. The measured parameters must be available in a reasonable time period.</I></B> Since the gait laboratory must compete with other clinical services for attention and funding, it is imperative that the issue of efficiency be addressed. When computer-aided tomographic (CAT) scanners and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) first emerged,  it didn't take three weeks to produce a printout. Yet until quite recently, this is how long it took for gait labs to generate a report. Modern systems have reduced the tedium of tracking markers and it is now possible to produce a full printout within an hour or two of the patient's lab visit. In the future we can look forward to 3D kinematics systems with the ability to track markers in real time. We could have used such a system a few years ago when a patient traveled five hours in a snowstorm for a gait study, only for us to discover the next day that the pelvic marker was missing and the study had to be repeated.
<P><B><I>8. The cost of the gait study should reflect the benefit provided by the information.</I></B> Gait analysis does not yet have its own CPT (Current Procedure Terminology) codes approved by the American Medical Association. However, many laboratories, including our own, have collaborated successfully with insurance companies to cover the costs of clinical studies. Since these costs are comparable to a CAT scan or MRI, we need to make quite certain that the information provided is worth the investment. The utility of the measure depends on the experience of the person doing the interpretation. Our challenge, therefore, is to make quite certain that clinicians who use gait lab facilities are properly educated and informed. The future success of these labs will be assured if mainstream clinicians and the health insurance industry recognize the crucial role they play in evaluating treatment outcome.
<P><B><I>9. The cost of the equipment should be within the reach of small clinics.</I></B> It is not unusual to budget at least $250,000 for a new gait laboratory. Thus, the price of the equipment has limited labs to large hospitals and medical centers. While much of the cost so far has been related to the significant development effort invested by companies, it is also true that prices are determined by what the market will bear. Hopefully the impact of technology in the consumer market--particularly in telemetry and video cameras--will lead to a significant reduction in the price of gait lab equipment. This will enable smaller clinics and outpatient centers to afford gait laboratories, thus ensuring their growth and acceptance in the future. 
<P><B><I>10. Referring clinicians should understand what the clinical gait laboratory can and cannot do.</I></B> The general population is easily impressed with computer technology, and therefore misconceptions exist about the role of gait laboratories in clinical evaluation and treatment. 
<P>Medical tests can be diagnostic, discriminatory, or evaluative. Information derived from gait analyses is not diagnostic--one cannot determine what type of disease a person has solely by the way he or she walks. Gait analysis can discriminate levels of motor involvement within diagnostic categories. So, by and large, the major role of gait labs is evaluative. We usually are more interested in how people change over time or as a result of a specified intervention. 
<P>In summary, the field of gait analysis has had some success in satisfying each of the 10 criteria. However, there is no room for complacency. If gait analysis is to thrive in the new healthcare environment, then lab personnel--clinicians, scientists, and engineers-- have to continue to improve the quality and versatility of their clinical service.

<H2>ACFAS wow's 'em</H2>
The American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons Annual Meeting last month in New Orleans included several leading orthopedic surgeons on its faculty. Lowell Lutter, MD, and James Sammarco, MD, were among the orthopedists who lectured at the podiatric meeting. Among the many topics explored was a manged care approach to "Are there too many foot surgeons?"
<P>One of the best attended events was a panel on "Dance" chaired by Dr. Sammarco, a nationally recognized dance medicine expert. Sammarco urged all to realize the special physical demands dance devotees impose upon themselves, and how difficult it is to diagnose and treat peroneus longus injuries. To make his point, Dr. Sammarco jokingly recalled the physician who remarked, "Well, <I>there's</I> an injury I've never seen before. He was answered, "But it has seen you...many times."
<P>The ACFAS meeting is increasingly becoming a first class event. Unfortunately, it has been improving so rapidly, it is now experiencing a crisis of excellence. Chaos and mismanagement are a feature of the convention's operation, a problem the dedicated ACFAS leadership is determined to overcome.

<H2>Gillis Long survey</H2>
The Gillis Long Hansen's Disease Center is conducting a broad cross-specialty survey of orthotic materials use under the direction of Jim Foto, CPed. Questionnaires recently arrived in the mailboxes of some 3,500 podiatrists, pedorthitists, orthotists, and other members of the biomechanics mainstream. The Gillis Long Center has arranged for return postage and statistical analysis. Results will be published first in a forthcoming issue of <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>.

<H2>More <CITE>Stride</CITE> in the box, the store, and on the plane</H2>
The latest to join the <CITE>Stride</CITE> movement include an airline, an orthotic materials supplier, and one of America's largest shoe retailers. <CITE>Stride Magazine</CITE>, the patient magazine devoted to biomechanics, is now being distributed by Western Pacific Airlines to its passengers, scores of Athlete's Foot outlets to their customers, and JMS Plastics is inserting subscription cards in its shipments. <CITE>Stride</CITE> is now also reopening acceptance of doctors to distribute magazines free of charge to their patients. Inquiries should be faxed to (301)-770-7062. 

<H2>ACFAS Learning Center</H2>
The American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons has opened the Skills Learning Center, a cutting edge facility designed to improve the skills of the association's members, in Park Ridge, Illinois. The center will offer a variety of courses on the foot and ankle, including plastic and arthroscopic surgery, internal fixation, and forefoot and rearfoot surgery. The arthroscopy, endoscopy and fixation courses will be offered quarterly.
<P>Coroprate-sponsored courses will also be scheduled. For now, the association plans to offer 15-20 courses a year with a 36-seat limit for the arthroscopy and endoscopy courses and a 50-seat limit for the plastic surgery classes.
<P>The Skills Learning Center is seeking the approval of the Council on Podiatric Medical Education for CME credits.

<H2>Hydrotherapy gets a soaking</H2>
Hydrotherapy is being misused by a large number of practitioners, according to a recent report by HHS' Office of the Inspector General. A recent audit of office-based physical therapy by the OIG concluded that several hundred examples of lower extremity whirlpool therapy submitted for reimbursement were for essentially unnecessary, palliative and non-therapeutic purposes. <P>The OIG's investigation cut across all specialties from orthopedics to podiatry to physical therapy. Some $47 million in waste was uncovered by the random audit of 300 beneficiaries. The OIG concluded that 78 percent of the patient claims were unqualified for reimbursement, prompting its recommendation that HCFA suspend all such payments and thereby save some $235 million. HCFA has thus far declined to adopt the recommendation. Although the audit covered a number of specialties, it cited podiatry as "the least likely to provide acceptable physical therapy services." 
<P>The OIG is urging HCFA to apply the same outpatient reimbursement standards observed by physical therapists applied to the spectrum of providers, from osteopaths to physiatrists.

<H1>Points of Contention</H1>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1><I><B>Hundreds of physicians each year add acupuncture to their practice to treat lower extremity pain. Why?</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>


<H2>J.P. is still in pain.</H2> 
On April 19, 1989, J.P. Reali was installing audio equipment at a construction site. Suddenly, he saw the accident coming and jumped back. But he couldn't dodge the falling material. In an instant, 3,000 pounds of sheet rock fell on his leg, crushing his left foot. A painful Lis Franc fracture resulted. The 25-year-old musician was rushed to a hospital, beginning a long course of treatment involving a variety of specialists. An orthopedic surgeon treated the fractures. After four months on crutches, Reali's muscles had atrophied, so the orthopedist sent him to a podiatrist to determine the need for foot orthoses. The podiatrist saw Reali several times and later directed a staff pedorthist to fit him with hard cork orthoses. 
<P>"I wore them out in a year," Reali recalls. "Then they gave me steel reinforced leather. I wore those out too." Eventually, Reali was able to manage his biomechanical problem, but the pain just never went away. "I developed arthritis in the joints that I broke," he explains. "Another orthopedist tried five or six prescription arthritis pain medications. They didn't really relieve the pain, they just made me feel strange. So I stopped those of my own free will. I decided to live with pain. The only alternative was fusion of the joints, which would give me a stiffer but pain-free foot. But I didn't want to do that." So Reali endured the pain--until he had endured enough. 
<P>"I heard acupuncture could relieve pain. My doctor laughed at me and would not prescribe it. I was open to anything. But the doctor wasn't. I was disappointed that he was so close-minded." Eventually, Reali picked up a Yellow Pages and found an acupuncturist. "I went twice and both times got immediate relief, lasting from a week to 10 days," he says. Treatments involved a group of long needles inserted and gently twirled at various points on his foot. Sometimes a small electric charge was added. No herbs were burned by this therapist, but this technique, called moxibustion, is widespread among many acupuncturists. "It was $80 per treatment and I paid it out of my own pocket," says Reali. "I'd still be going if I could afford it." 
<P>Reali is a textbook example of why some people lose confidence in mainstream medicine and seek out unconventional therapy. "Hey, acupuncture works," he says. "Absolutely. It's not a cure but it is a treatment. If a doctor won't consider acupuncture, then that isn't benefiting the patient. Doctors should be more open-minded. I tell them, 'You're entitled to your opinion--but I know what works for me.'" 
<P>America's healthcare system has for some time been undergoing a revolution that reaches far beyond managed care. Patients are now embracing unconventional therapies that a few years ago would have been met by amused chuckles in polite company. What was unorthodox is fast becoming mainstream. Ironically, managed care is going along with the idea and often reimburses these procedures. And where patients and reimbursement go, physicians will follow. 
<P>The alternative medicine market is booming, growing at a rate greater, in some respects, than the mainstream healthcare industry, suggests an oft-cited 1993 study by  David M. Eisenberg, MD, and colleagues at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital. About one-third of respondents in the national survey reported using unconventional therapy--often without informing their primary care provider.
<P>Extrapolating that data to the entire U.S. population, the authors produced startling statistics: Americans annually spend nearly as much money on unconventional therapy ($10.3 billion) as paid out-of-pocket for all U.S. hospitalization ($12.8 billion). The number of visits to practitioners of alternative therapies each year is greater than visits to primary care physicians.
<P>Many of the people who choose acupuncture enthusiastically claim relief of pain symptoms. Whether that relief comes as a result of genuine therapeutic action, placebo, the power of suggestion, or something mystic and unexplainable is anyone's guess. But if a patient in pain reports that the pain goes away under a certain modality, that modality merits investigation. Even agents as ambiguous as a mother's touch or the power of positive thinking are undeniably successful ways of addressing pain for many individuals. 
<P>Acupuncture has captured the fascination of millions of Americans who have spent billion of dollars this decade alone for this as yet unproven modality. Yet believers include some of America's clearest and most cynical thinkers. Indeed, when <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> began looking into the subject, looking no further than our immediate contacts, we discovered one seasoned health editor, a highly educated musician, an investor, and several physicians who swear by the procedure. When even conservative insurance companies reimburse acupuncture, the question must be asked: Is acupuncture indeed nothing more than quackery, or is it nothing less than a treatment that merits serious consideration and debate?
<P>Even though the AMA still considers acupuncture "an unproven remedy," a 1993 review by the Food and Drug Administration estimates there are up to 12 million visits to acupuncturists annually, representing an annual $500 million in healthcare spending. And earlier this year, the FDA removed the last barrier to widespread insurance coverage by grandfathering acupuncture needles as medical devices--even as the agency was silent on efficacy. <P>Interest in acupuncture by patients and providers is "exploding," says James Dowden, executive director of the American Medical Acupuncture Association, a group with about 750 physician members that has quadrupled in size in four years. The group's ranks are comprised mainly of MDs, with DOs constituting the second largest specialty.
<P>"There is evidence of growing interest among people with chronic conditions to seek methods other than traditional medicine, and an increasing willingness by physicians to reach out to alternative medicine in all forms," says Dowden. "There has been recognition... that there may be a place for acupuncture. There is also increasing awareness among those who don't provide acupuncture that patients are looking for alternatives."
<P>Bart Edwards, DPM, of Richmond, California, is one of a growing number of providers adding acupuncture to their practices. He began using acupuncture a year ago after learning the technique from a pediatrician friend in the Bay area. Dr. Edwards employs acupuncture on four or five patients per week, often for neuritic pain and other chronic conditions of the foot. Acupuncture is "primarily for those patients who've failed normal, traditional sorts of treatment," says Dr. Edwards. "A lot of patients I see have exhausted every other resource and have resigned themselves to living with pain."
<P>Acupuncture is becoming a popular remedy among athletes to relieve pain and speed recovery from a variety of acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries, says John Steinke, president of the 200-member National Sports Acupuncture Association. "We see a lot of ankle sprains and strains, tennis elbow, tendonitis, and fractures," says Steinke. "Athletes are always looking for the quickest way to get back to normal, and we find that what we do generally accelerates that process." Why are so many mainstream providers learning acupuncture? Because their patients want it, says Dowden. 
<P>Enter Joseph Helms MD, a Berkeley, California family practice doctor who may be America's leading source of physician training in acupuncture. Dr. Helms conducts a 200 CME course through the UCLA Medical School Office of Continuing Medical Education. This year, Dr. Helms will conduct five clinical units with two courses. The courses include 150 hours of home video study. Cost is $4,000 per course, which reflects the value physicians attach to it. Approximately 350 physicians per year (up from about 70 a few years ago) will participate this year, including anesthesiologists, pain medicine physicians, sports physicians, family practice doctors, orthopedic surgeons, physiatrists, osteopaths, and a few podiatrists. Physicians come from all over America to take the course. 
<P>Dr. Helms, who received his training in France, stresses that he is not graduating accredited primary acupuncture providers. Nor is UCLA providing any degree of competency. Completing the course yields a course completion certificate and no more. "Our course trains doctors in a special modality among other modalities; it does not qualify them to become primary providers of acupuncture," says Dr. Helms.
<P>The Kaiser Foundation Rehabilitation Center in Vallejo, California, opened an Alternative Medicine Clinic last October where 400 patients a month receive acupuncture treatments. Acupuncture is "something that our members want, and it's important that we be responsive," says the clinic's founder, Ward Gypson, MD. "For some things, such as chronic pain management, there are unfortunately not a lot of things mainstream medicine has to offer. People are looking for alternatives, and are finding that some of these techniques are useful."
<P>Even the prestigious National Institutes of Health is taking a serious look at acupuncture. Since being nudged by Congress to establish the much discussed Office of Alternative Medicine in 1991, NIH funding for research in unconventional remedies has increased to $13.6 million a year. Among the 73 alternative medicine research awards made by the NIH in 1994--including studies of "prayer intervention" on substance abuse treatment and the effect of "therapeutic touch" on the immune system--are four clinical trials of acupuncture.
<P>Acupuncture is gaining acceptance among a growing number of HMOs and insurers. Although practices vary across the nation, payers will often cover acupuncture treatments if performed by a physician, podiatrist, or other licensed professionals with recognized credentials. "Physicians have wide latitude over the type of treatments they give in an office visit," says Don White, spokesman for the Group Health Association of American, an HMO trade group. "We are not in a position to judge scientific merit. It all depends on the local standards of care."
<P>Insurers, HMOs, and other payers often include acupuncture as a benefit because it is a  relatively inexpensive intervention that appeals to a growing number of patients. "Compare the cost of acupuncture for the treatment of back pain--perhaps 10 office visits for $500--versus the cost of surgery," says Brian Berman, MD, of the Office of Complementary Medicine at the University of Maryland. "If it works." Critics of managed care point to acupuncture as just more proof that managed care is ruining the quality of care in America by encouraging the cheapest form of treatment--whether it works or not. 
<P>What acupuncture lacks is some good old fashioned scientific proof. Unfortunately, point  out its defenders, such scientific proof is woefully missing from much of modern medicine as well. There are precious few studies beyond anecdotal reports authenticating the value of foot orthoses, enhanced bone union via electrical stimulation, and many therapies commonly prescribed by the biomechanics mainstream.
<P>The traditional, Oriental explanation of acupuncture is that the needles redirect an energy called qi or ch'i (pronounced "chee") that flows along "meridians" on the surface of the body--a view few practitioners take seriously today. While dismissing the meridian theory, many wonder whether stimulating the nervous system or other points may cause a genuine effect that is not yet understood or mastered. What even the harshest critics cannot deny is that many patients in pain claim acupuncture works wonders for them.
<P>Among the most hardened of the harsh critics is the National Council Against Health Fraud's acupuncture task force. The task force advances four leading theories to explain the analgesic effects of acupuncture:
<UL><LI><B>Psychological effect.</B> The easiest explanation for acupuncture is the placebo effect. Practitioners of alternative medicine tend to spend more time with patients, which may have as much to do with a sense of well-being as the acupuncture treatment itself. The needles also create a diversion that may distract patients from their discomfort. "Misdirection is a favorite tool of magicians," says Wallace Sampson, MD, of Stanford University, who chaired the National Council Against Health Fraud's acupuncture task force.
<P><LI><B>The "gate theory" of pain.</B> Acupuncture needles may stimulate nerves that block the perception of pain from organs and other internal structures. While early "gate theory" ideas gained interest, research has not lead to an accepted anatomical or physiological scientific basis, Dr. Sampson says.
<P><LI><B>Counterirritation.</B> Acupuncture needles may produce a minor irritation that masks the pain of injury, similar to the use of OTC topical so-called pain remedies commonly in use today. Ben-Gay is a good example.
<P><LI><B>Endorphins.</B> Narcotic-like endorphins are released in the brain after patients are given acupuncture treatments, which some studies indicate has an analgesic effect. "Any time you stick a sharp object in somebody, you'll release endorphins," says William Jarvis, PhD, president of the National Council Against Health Fraud. "If you're trying to trigger endorphins, there are easier and safer ways of doing it."</UL>
<P>Aside from the absence of a scientific basis, the most serious complaint against acupuncture is the lack of reproducible methodology. There is wide variation in the practice of acupuncture, and the number of acupuncture points represented on training charts range from 365 to more than 2,000, according to Dr. Sampson. Skimming the acupuncture publication <CITE>Meridians</CITE> makes clear to any observer that numerous schools, styles, and techniques exist within the acupuncture community. Well-controlled blinded clinical studies of acupuncture are difficult to design because of operator effects and the need for a sham procedure to use as a control. Investigators could not designate any part of the body a control area since virtually all parts are identifiable points by some school of acupuncture thought.
<P>Clinical studies of acupuncture show inconsistent results. A "meta-analysis" of 91 clinical trials of acupuncture by a team of Dutch researchers found that the differences between acupuncture and control groups diminish as the study designs become more rigorous. "The best-designed studies show the least effect above a sham procedure," says Dr. Sampson. According to a <CITE>Pain Magazine</CITE> review of literature, methodologies relied upon postal questionnaires or telephone interviews for outcome data, asking such questions as "Did you benefit from the treatment? Answer Y/N." In many instances, needling was found to be random. "Any rational person who takes a look at the literature will see that it's nothing more than placebo," says Sampson. Dr. Helms angrily disputes Dr. Sampson, saying that the medical benefits of acupuncture have already been proven. 
<P>Clearly, it's easy for critics to accentuate the negative, and for defenders to accentuate the positive. 
<P>Acupuncture would be easy to dismiss were it not for nagging evidence that it may have a therapeutic role in contemporary medicine. A pilot study at the University of Maryland--one of the first tests of the analgesic effects of acupuncture funded by the Office of Alternative Medicine--found that two acupuncture treatments a week were better than anti-inflammatory drugs alone in reducing pain and increasing mobility for eight out of 12 elderly patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Another study, also at Maryland, suggests that acupuncture may be useful in controlling the postoperative pain of tooth extraction.
<P>"I have seen results in our clinic that seem to be more than just the placebo effect," says Dr. Berman, principal investigator of the osteoarthritis trial. Even if acupuncture were simply a placebo, "you could probably say that most medicine is just the placebo effect. How much of physical therapy has been put through randomized clinical trials?" Given the large number of acupuncture treatments performed each year, reports of serious complications are rare, even in the hands of modestly trained therapists. 
<P>Of course a leading concern is that acupuncture may be the first step on the slippery slope toward quackery. A person may begin with acupuncture, but then be drawn further into unconventional remedies. Some acupuncturists burn herbal sticks (moxibustion), or allow low-voltage current to be delivered through the needles. It isn't uncommon for acupuncturists to inject clients with substances or prescribe herbs that might be poisonous. While acupuncture most closely identifies as a remedy for pain control and addictions, some claims for the technique appear outlandish--especially those which claim musculoskeletal repair. A 1992 article in the <CITE>American Journal of Acupuncture</CITE> implies that needling was able to reduce the degree of bunion deformity. <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> asked one of the nation's leading physician advocates of acupuncture whether he thought the treatment could affect the structures of the body. He reluctantly answered, "No," but only on condition of anonymity because the subject is apparently a highly charged one within the acupuncture community. 
<P>The fear that quackery won't be recognized "doesn't give patients much credit," contends Dr. Berman, "Just because [patients] are trying acupuncture doesn't mean they've lost their reason. They're just looking for relief."
<P>Even proponents of acupuncture admit that inconsistency and the lack of a scientific body of knowledge are hindering its wider acceptance. Acupuncture and other alternative medicine practices are "a huge area in need of research," says Dr. Gypson. "What concerns me is that there are practitioners who are not regulated. If we were to study a modality such as herbal medicine, we would do it under research protocols. We can control things, in terms of making sure it is safe and also to measure effectiveness. Other practitioners may not." This too is a political hot potato within the acupuncture community. When <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> asked one leading doctor practicing acupuncture whether non-physicians should be allowed to treat patients, again a condition of anonymity was requested as he answered, "No." 
<P>Acupuncture is permitted in all 50 states with varying degrees of regulation. In some states, acupuncture may be performed only by a physician. Twenty-two states accept accreditation by the National Commission for the Certification of Acupuncturists, which requires two years of college-level training or four years of apprenticeship before attempting a written and practical examination. California maintains one of the strictest standards for acupuncturists, requiring four academic years of education with at least 1,548 hours of theory and 800 hours of clinical training. In some states, acupuncture is unregulated.
<P>Proponents hope that continued clinical research by the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine and other mainstream organizations will help establish a scientific basis for acupuncture, while improved accreditation will enhance the delivery of alternative care to patients. Until well-controlled clinical trials demonstrate safety and efficacy, hardliners contend acupuncture has no role in modern medicine. "It is not ethical to treat a person with a delusion," says Dr. Sampson.
<P>But as long as millions of patients are eager to relate success stories, acupuncture cries out for pointed debate and research.

<P>In a few years, will our children inherit quality accessible healthcare, or will the system be crippled when they need it most?
<P>Our cover story this month looks at the controversial subject of acupuncture. Whether acupuncture is mere quackery or in fact holds some role in treatment, especially lower extremity pain, is a debate that will rage on. But this much we do know. Millions of Americans are turning to acupuncture, third party payers are spending millions annually to reimburse the procedures, the FDA has just grandfathered acupuncture needles as medical devices, and thousands of physicians have either added acupuncture skills to their practice or are referring cases to acupuncture therapists. <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> is inviting debate within the biomechanics mainstream with our special report, <A HREF="/biomech/may96/cover.html"><I>Points of Contention</I></A>. Please send your experiences and comments to <A HREF="mailto:bioletters@ifi-rock.com">Contact Point</A>.
<P>Every custom orthosis requires a three-dimensional intermediary impression. Many modalities are in use: from impression pillows to plaster casting to laser scanning. But in a highly opinionated article, Paul Scherer, DPM, argues that one commonly used modality, the foam box, is an inadequate means of taking foot impressions. In a subsequent article, we will present the view that foam boxes represent a cost-effective and clinically sufficient means of obtaining an intermediary impression. In the meantime, we again welcome your comments to <A HREF="mailto:bioletters@ifi-rock.com">Contact Point</A>.
<P>A brief report on the Web. We finally received our requested new addresses. The main BioMechanics Gateway is now at www.biomech.com/biomech.  We completely redesigned its look and continue adding features. Our News Section now connects to a gamut of publications, from <CITE>Sports Illustrated</CITE> to the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE>. We now link to a long list of organizations from the burgeoning sites of the American Medical Association to the newly online American Academy of Orthotists and Prosthetists. We have also added Breaking News and Announcements sections. 
<P>Our Mall will be filled with detailed information on vendor products and services: everything from specifications to dealer information, from pricing to order forms, from email connections to online tutorials. And remember, it is all completely interactive with the <CITE>BioMechanics Desk Reference</CITE>. Far beyond just advertisements, our Mall is becoming the commercial drive-through for the biomechanics mainstream along the Information Superhighway.
<P>Now a word about <CITE>Stride</CITE>, our quarterly patient magazine. It is no secret that I have had it up to here with the crippling effects of managed care. The second issue of <CITE>Stride</CITE>, now circulating in doctors' offices, shoe stores, and fitness salons everywhere, features a powerful Editors' letter titled <I>Unmanaged Care</I>. In it, <CITE>Stride</CITE> calls for a new alliance of physicians and patients to save American healthcare from the ravages of managed care. Clearly, the controllers are out of control. The medical establishment has been portrayed as opposing managed care out of self-interest. You can't do it alone. Unless we motivate and unite with patients, America will be powerless to reform the reformers. Reach out to your patients with the <A HREF="/stride/v1n2/pubmemo.html"><CITE>Stride</CITE> Editors' letter</A>, which we are providing to leading professional practitioner organizations for unlimited distribution. I'd like to close this publisher's memo with the final words of that <CITE>Stride</CITE> letter:
<P>"This editorial was written not for the medical establishment, or for any advertisers, or even for people like you and us. This was written for our daughter, age 11, and sons and daughters everywhere. In a few years, will they inherit quality accessible healthcare that is quick, cost-effective and efficient, or will the system be crippled when they need it most? You decide."

<H1>1996 Knee Brace Source List</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>The biomechanics mainstream incessantly develops new understandings of clinical efficacy in knee biomechanics, and with equal determination searches for innovation in knee bracing. That innovation must manifest technologic advance and cost-effectiveness. Designers and manufacturers have responded with a spectrum of devices that are either better designed, better built, better priced, or even all of the above. 
<P>The number of variables and options a practitioner must consider when prescribing knee braces is constantly growing. To help, <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> has assembled its annual Knee Brace Source List. The 1996 list is almost 50 percent larger than last year's, both because more models are available and because we broadened our scope. At the same time, we deleted a few companies or did not list them if they did not provide answers to our questions.
<P>As before, our compilation was drawn from manufacturer descriptions of the technical features of their products and were required to be devoid of superlatives or commercial content. These description were then edited by our staff and submitted to our reviewers. Manufacturers were limited to three models, and all suppliers--large and small--were treated equally.

<H1>O&#38;P://on/the/Web</H1>

<P><I>by Sara Aase</I>
</CENTER>

<P>As the lights dimmed at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthotists and Prosthetists, Alvin Pike, CP cried at the sight flashed on a giant screen before his eyes: the brand new Academy home page, larger than life. In that moment, a longtime dream was realized. O&#38;P, as of the first week of March, 1996, was officially on-line.
<P>"These last few weeks I've been pretty damn happy," said Pike, a past Academy president and director of professional relations for Otto Bock Orthopedic Industry, which also has a brand new home page. Looked to as "ahead of his time" by some of his colleagues, Pike is largely responsible for pushing a segment of his profession into the '90s, organizing a grass-roots campaign for computer databases, e-mail, and finally the World Wide Web. He also will be "evangelizing" wherever he's asked to speak, trying to persuade everyone in his profession to take advantage of the Internet. He calls the Web an essential tool--providing unprecedented, cost-effective ways for information sharing for now and beyond. "A Web page is not just for us today but for the student of tomorrow," he said. "It's for the six-year-old who's going to become a prosthetist. We have to be there for him. The Web is an investment in the future."

<H2>O&#38;P Explosion</H2>
Go on-line and you'll quickly see Pike is not alone in his vision. Indeed the burgeoning presence of orthotic, prosthetic, and related sites on the World Wide Web is something amazing to behold. Within the past six months this niche has exploded. "Veterans" with sites at least one calendar year old are in the minority. Most date anywhere from last summer to yesterday. 
<P>"Old-timers" are excited to see O&#38;P Web outposts spreading like new prairie towns. A common refrain is, "there was no such information when I got here." Now, they say, information and resources are downright plentiful. Newbies, like the "settlers" they are, are in turn excited about the opportunities before them: establishing a new and unique presence, linking to the community, getting feedback from customers and colleagues, and generating sales.  

<H2>Everyone's Doing It, Should You?</H2>
Even with all the recent hype, the Web, of course, has not yet reached the technological status of the telephone or TV. In an age where there isn't even a fax machine in every O&#38;P office, the concept of the Internet and all its possibilities can be overwhelming. Some companies, such as Bauerfeind, simply aren't yet ready to take the plunge to the Web, said Sylvia Paffrath, vice president of marketing for Bauerfeind. 
<P>Any local practice, association, or supplier might wonder what the Web could possibly offer. Would it be worth the startup and maintenance costs? Would it actually generate any new business? The typical questions you'd ask yourself are further compounded by the "unknowns" of the Web: Who's regulating this thing? What will access be like in the future? Will anybody actually make any money? Should they? And how?
<P>"It's like TV in the '50s, where people didn't really know what it was going to be," said Diane Vollum, marketing specialist at Otto Bock and co-coordinator of Otto Bock's new Web site. "Right now it's just for passing information around, but in the future I expect it to be in every part of our lives. The good thing in getting in on the first wave is we'll learn along the way, but the downside is we'll probably make every mistake."
<P>Doubts aside, most think the Web's benefits will outweigh its risks. O&#38;P professionals already see it as a better brochure, fax machine, advertisement, and research tool. 

<H2>The Ultimate Business and Research Tool</H2>
Researchers find instant access to global data, whether it's a study on "Modeling the Biomechanics of Human Joints and Prosthetic Implants" at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory site or "Modification of the Local Effective Stiffness of Seating Foams" at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Everything the viewer can see can be downloaded and printed. Within minutes, you can determine if others are studying your problem--and you can exchange views by accessing the e-mail found at virtually all sites. "Research can go right out on the Web and be analyzed, commented on, and added to almost immediately," said John Bergmann, president of Bergmann Orthotic Laboratory. "I see research advancing very rapidly with this whole system."
<P>For local practitioners, exploiting the Web means plugging into community and specialized Web networks. "Plugging in" means advertising and linking. Linking is generally free, and allows any user to go from a local or regional site to yours with a mere mouse click. To establish a link, you must get the cooperation of the Webmaster and interest that person in your site. If you have something that will enhance said site, you can be linked in minutes. For instance, a Seattle practitioner with a home page could find a local Seattle community gateway and be listed and linked under healthcare practitioners. That practitioner could also take a small ad that when clicked would transport the viewer to his home page or a larger multi-page advertisement or brochure.
<P>Vollum said the Web will help Otto Bock become more sophisticated about what customers want from them. "As they ask questions (through the Web), such as for research or products or jobs, we'll be able to keep a log so we can figure out the best ways to address general questions," she said.
<P>Bergmann says the Web provides a global presence far more quickly and easily than figuring out in which magazines to advertise. Likewise, he says, the Web is friendlier to Bergmann's 3-D images than print. 
<P>As an added bonus, advertising on the Web generally costs peanuts compared to traditional methods. Some websites charge just a few dollars per month for sponsorship. That's one reason Michael Kaczkowski, director of Aesthetic Concerns Prosthetics, decided to get on the Web. "In my business people have to see the product before they buy," he said. "It can cost $10,000 for a really good color brochure, and then there's postage. With the Web you can make continual updates at a minimum cost."
<P>A common fear is that not enough people are viewing the Web to justify the investment. But playing that numbers game, most argue, is failing to understand the power of the Web--and advertising relativity. When Flex-Foot, for example, advertises on national TV, it reaches millions and finds that valuable. When it advertises in an O&#38;P journal, which Flex-Foot also finds valuable, it reaches just a few thousand. When at an O&#38;P convention, Flex-Foot may reach only one hundred. But those one hundred contacts are extremely valuable, face-to-face, quality contacts. And all three modes reinforce each other. In its current incarnation, Web advertising means achieving an intense quality contact with a user or patient who is staring at your information. Indeed, the encounter is not unlike a personal sales call--but it's done at the user's convenience, with no pressure from on-looking sales people. And it has the added appeal of being on the Web.
<P>In the same vein, Reicken Orthotic Laboratory prints up expensive, four-color brochures, expecting to reach just hundreds. But when Reicken faxes color material to a customer, the transmission ruins the images. With the Web, however, Carl Riecken can just ask a customer to check the lab's electronic catalog on the BioMechanics Gateway or BioMechanics' Prosthetics Home Page to see what the products really look like. Within moments, the customer can click through his product offerings, download or print the information.
<P>Any practice that has considered print, radio, or TV advertising is a candidate for Web advertising. And don't limit yourself to just specialty-specific sites. Link and advertise on networks run by various amputee, religious, and social groups--for example, the Amputee Home Page, or a local Vietnam vets page.
<P>Pike points out that many offices already have some Web essentials: a computer and modem for electronic billing. "You already have the hardware," he said. "How are you going to use it? How can you make it do more for you?"

<H2>Beyond Business</H2>
Just as the Internet changes your business, it also can affect your personal and professional relations in ways you never imagined. Internet e-mail and the Web combine to lend a whole new realm to consulting. With these tools, Pike and colleagues quickly found help for a 21-year-old Bosnian woman who had lost both arms in the war. Likewise, Internet posts and Web pages allow them to rally members to respond to pending legislation.
<P>Web presence can be pure promotion. Kaczkowski said although most of his patient business still comes from traditional communication methods, his Web page has sparked interest from many students and research companies. A museum has even set up an interactive display using products from Aesthetic Concern Prosthetics. "It's not just a business," he said. "There's all sorts of things you'd never have gotten otherwise." 
<P>His peers agree. Paul Prusakowski, a CO at Shands Hospital at the University of Florida who also runs the Web service O&#38;P Digital Technologies, says, "You gain contacts around the world that are both fun and helpful. You meet people you would have just walked by at a convention."
<P>In fact, looking at a page purely in terms of profit misses the point, says Sean Henahan, webmaster of the Flex-Foot home page, which grew out of a newsletter. "The Web is really underestimated as a communication tool--it's emphasized for marketing. But (Flex-Foot) is really looking at it as a customer service, for patients and prosthetists--for the whole community of O&#38;P. With it, you have a way of hearing back from readers that you don't get in print or radio and TV. We do get a lot of e-mail, and the company's pretty happy about being able to reach patients like that." 
<P>It's easy to overspend creating your website. One company spent so much on creating its Website--$40,000--that it couldn't afford $25 monthly to link it to a gateway. Brad Kliewer, who heads up Web Wise, <CITE>BioMechanics'</CITE> discount Web developer, says, "If people are going to go broke getting on the Web, they won't be able to enjoy its benefits. That's why we recommend people start conservatively and work up from there. It should only cost a thousand or two to get a basic site up and running."
<P>Many of the folks already on-line in O&#38;P have experience with or background knowledge of computers--ranging from simply "playing" to programming knowledge. But experience is not necessary. All "Webmasters" are in fact really learning as they go, because so many variables affect the performance of a page. For instance, every browser--Web exploring software--handles the basic Web hypertext markup language, HTML, differently. Some "forgive" errors in code and display a page correctly anyway. Some don't. For this reason it's a good idea to invest in as many browsers as you can. If we at <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> forget a quote at the end of a command or type in the wrong image size, for example, IBM WebExplorer accommodates the error and displays the page correctly. The same page in some versions of Netscape Navigator, however, is a disaster. Some browsers support the latest developments in HTML, such as tables; some don't. In fact some browsers support only text versions of Web pages. There are different ways to manipulate images that will make pages load faster or slower. And of course, the page's server and user's modem drastically affect page performance. To further complicate things, programming capabilities and browser support of those capabilities are advancing so quickly that it's tough to keep up. In short, the "rules" are fluid, and what's "right" is continually up for discussion. <CITE>Byte Magazine</CITE>, for example--a source you'd think would be "expert" at the process--keeps a running "Web project" on its site to discuss what they've learned and continue to learn.
<P>Setting up your own page can be relatively easy if you pick up the skills yourself or secure the right help. The hard part--and key to your site's success--is maintaining, improving, and expanding your site. Of course, many programs, services, and people now exist to do this kind of worrying for you: simple on-line HTML-correcting utilities; software programs like CompuServe's Page Wizard that allow you to plug content into a pre-formatted Web page; Web page design services; freelancers; books; publications or businesses with in-house computer staff; or your next-door neighbor. Prices and quality for Web services vary wildly, so shop around.
<P>No matter how you view--or don't view--the World Wide Web now, count on it staying around. It's anyone's guess how it will evolve, but for the O&#38;P community, it has already opened a whole new world.

<H2>Tips://for/getting/webbed</H2>
Whether you set up your own site or simply affiliate with another, the O&#38;P community has plenty of tips:  
<P>1. Link yourself and others as much as you can. People will find you more easily as part of an interconnected community than as an island.  
<P>2. Submit (and re-submit) entries to all the search engines. It will take awhile--maybe months--before you'll be indexed. You'll be anxious, but you can't make indexers go any faster.  
<P>3. Invest in good browsers, and more than one kind. Even though Netscape dominates, not everyone uses it. If you alienate a potential user because of browser incompatibility, they won't come back.  
<P>4. Work at updating your page. People want new information. That's why they come back. Or at least link up with a well-travelled Web site, such as the <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> gateway, <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> Prosthetic Home Page, <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> O&#38;P Home Page, O&#38;P Network Connection, O&#38;P OnLine, or Biomechanics World Wide.  
<P>5. Time your pages' download times, on more than one browser and from more than one location. If it takes a minute or more to load, people will be reluctant to come back. And their computers may time-out anyway.  
<P>6. Don't use unnecessary graphics or links that don't really go anywhere. They just frustrate users.  
<P>7. Provide a point of contact on most pages. Some viewers also appreciate "constructed" and "last updated" dates.  
<P>8. Link unto others as you would have them link unto you.  
<P>9. Learn to target your site. Are you talking to professionals or patients?  
<P>10. Your site, as it grows, will become more complex. Although easy to set up initially, true sophistication will require programming knowledge. The site likely also will require more than one person's full-time attention.

<FONT SIZE=+1>Custom Orthoses</FONT>
<H1>I don't want to leave you with a <BR>BAD IMPRESSION</H1>
<P><I>by Paul R. Scherer, DPM</I>


<H2><I>One man's argument against using foam boxes is sure to provoke heated debate.</I></H2>
</CENTER>

<HR>
<P>Practitioners who use foam boxes for impressions to make functional orthoses are only fooling themselves. They are looking for a short-cut to plaster or scanning and they are willing to compromise the effectiveness of the functional device.
<P>Just because impression foam is good for making custom insoles doesn't mean it is good for making functional custom orthoses. Just because other people use foam impressions doesn't make it a good technique. Probably the less people understand foot biomechanics the more they use impression foam.
<P>It is the shape of the orthosis that controls the foot, not the material you use. Therefore, it is the cast you take that makes a good orthosis because the cast is what determines the shape of the orthosis. But of course, if you can't take a good cast or hold the foot in a neutral position with the midtarsal joint locked, then it doesn't matter what material you use. You lose.
<P>To better understand the importance of taking a good negative impression, some simple logic may help. The foot can't work well unless the midtarsal joint is stable. We know this because feet with unstable midtarsal joints frequently have pathology or overuse symptoms. If you cast the midtarsal joint in its unstable position, the resulting orthosis will maintain the unstable position. Capturing the shape of the foot when the midtarsal joint is stable allows the orthosis to maintain a locked position.
<P>Remember that the foot can be either a rigid lever or a mobile adapter. Following heel strike, the heel everts, pronating the subtalar joint which subsequently unlocks the midtarsal joint. Some have speculated that this increased mobility is intended to allow the foot to adapt to irregular surfaces.
<P>External rotation of the support limb during mid-stance supinates the subtalar joint, subsequently locking the midtarsal joint and producing a rigid lever to propel the body forward. Unfortunately some feet, because of abnormal pronation, remain as mobile adapters when they should be rigid levers. The forces of locomotion are then distributed to the soft tissue rather than the osseous structures, producing symptoms and pathology.
<P>The idea with orthoses is to capture the shape of the foot while it is a rigid lever--when the subtalar joint is neutral and the midtarsal joint is rigid. An orthosis made from such an impression will hold the foot in this position for at least part of the gait cycle.
<P>Conventional negative casting or scanning allows the practitioner to push "up" on the lateral column of the foot pronating the midtarsal joint. Once immersed in foam, however, it is difficult, at best, to hold the subtalar joint in neutral. Because the foam is so soft, it is almost impossible to push "up" on the lateral column as the foot pushes down. 
<P>You don't have to understand all the theories of foot biomechanics to take a perfect negative impression. Learning to take a better cast is easy. The key is in knowing how to hold the foot in a proper position for casting or scanning. Any orthotic lab worth its stuff will help train you. There are only three steps to holding the foot in a more stable position: make sure the subtalar joint is in the neutral position; pronate the midtarsal joint to the end of its range of motion; and check to make sure the first ray is not dorsiflexed.
<P>After the cast is removed from the foot or the scan is complete and the image is on the screen, it is imperative to evaluate the image. Did you capture the heel contour? Is the first metatarsal head impression symmetrical? These are simple observations, like constellations on a star chart.
<P>The focus should not be on how quickly something is done in medicine--ask any surgeon.  Nor should the focus be on how cheaply something can be done.  The difference in cost is just a few dollars. The focus should be: Are you doing everything necessary to give your patient the best chance of getting better and giving your lab the best chance of making an orthosis that works?
<P>Quality labs don't like bad casts and they will do the best job they can with what they have to work with.  At the same time, most labs don't like to preach to their clients. So you have to make your own decision. A little effort for change can have a big effect on the outcome.

<H1>Computerized Cast Storage</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
<H2><I>More than just measuring devices, scanners are now in use to assemble orthotic data banks.</I></H2>
</CENTER>

<P>A few years ago, Allied-OSI struggled to organize more than 15,000 foot orthosis casts in a crammed warehouse. The warehouse was filled floor to ceiling with pallets and each pallet was numbered by floor and row. The location of each positive cast was scrupulously maintained by a complex computer program. Forklifts were at the ready to haul up a pallet when a cast was needed for a second prescription or an adjustment. Just retrieving a single positive was a major and costly production. 
<P>In the old days, Allied-OSI stored positives for three to five months. The positives are created by pouring plaster into the original negative cast, which is then discarded. Many labs store positives for six months to a year. But all that's over for Allied-OSI and many others who have converted to CAD-CAM orthoses and digital cast storage. Now when a cast comes in at Allied, it is scanned. The plaster negative is discarded after fabrication. Allied-OSI then stores negative images in a hard drive for two years and may decide to keep them for as long as practitioners require. Digital storage has helped Allied-OSI keep costs down. Indeed, its current price list is not much higher than its 1988 price list, according to a lab source.
<P>Dave McAnich, proprietor at Piedmont Labs, which uses the ADT OrthoCam fabrication system, says scanning negative casts has helped his lab and his clients. Piedmont moves scanned data onto floppy diskettes for long-term storage. Each floppy holds data on approximately 100 patients. The lab's library currently exceeds more than 600 such diskettes. "Once we have the file on diskette, we can refer to it easily. If a practitioner wants a second orthosis, say a dress device, we can do that without taking additional casts or scans. We just let the computer do it. The doctor simply submits a new request form. It saves time, money, and imaging for everyone." 
<P>McAnich says the old practice of manual cast storage for six months or even a year was not doing the job. "It isn't unusual for people to want a second pair often two years down the road. By that time, the original manual cast is usually forgotten. With computerized storage, we don't have that problem now or two years from now," explains McAnich.
<P>Benefoot uses an industrial version of its ScanCast 3D system, which captures both feet in a thirtieth of a second, and then stores the data on readable and writable optical drives. They can retrieve a cast with the press of some keystrokes. They can even produce a positive if a practitioner requests one; the lab simply calls up the data and carves a positive out of a durable material that itself forms the basis for another orthosis. Benefoot has been storing casts on optical disks since 1992 and already has hundreds of thousands of them on file.
<P>Digital storage is the chosen way for automated labs--but not all labs have chosen to automate. Most notable is PAL, arguably the largest and most used lab in the nation. All its devices are manually made and its storage is manual as well. That means more than 50,000 casts line the rows and walls of a warehouse in central Illinois where PAL is located. The company says it knows computerized cast storage is in its future, but that moment won't arrive until sometime next year. For now, PAL's warehouse may constitute the largest repository of plaster foot orthotic negatives in the world.
<P>All this negative information--pardon the use of the term--should contribute toward some positive research. Between Allied-OSI, Benefoot, and the ADT network, as well as many other automated labs, an extraordinary amount of pathometric foot data is available. Questions should be formulated. Do the datacasts reflect casting procedures, good or bad, that might have a treatment implication? What types of pathology are reflected in the datacasts that are not being treated? Can we identify any findings on efficacy given certain materials or conditions? 
<P>Once questions are formulated, software will have to be developed to analyze the data. The search for data granulations among far flung databases is sometimes called data mining. It's not an easy process, but new data mining software is coming online every day. With this much raw data readily at the disposal of the biomechanics mainstream, someone should think about using this information to remedy the age-old complaint about the absence of hard data in the foot orthosis field.

<H1>Moisture Wicking Fabrics</H1>
<P><I>by Scott Kantro, DPM</I>
</CENTER>

<P>The inside climate of the shoe is one of the most critical comfort factors for footwear. The average temperature inside a shoe in use ranges from 100-105 degrees Fahrenheit on a warm day, to up to 115 degrees Fahrenheit with exercise. The average pair of feet produces one half pint of perspiration in a single day. If the shoes are breathable, about 67 percent of that moisture will evaporate through the upper, but the remainder will be retained by the shoes themselves. If the rate of evaporation is restricted, more perspiration is generated, producing a hot, sticky, and "clammy" sensation, and increasing friction forces that can compromise foot health. 
<P>Shoe comfort is determined in part by the shoe's ability to absorb moisture and move it away from the skin so that the fabric in contact with the skin remains relatively dry--a process called wicking. That's where moisture wicking or hydrophilic materials come into play. Don't confuse wicking, which involves the transport of moisture, with waterproofing or water-resistance, which keeps water out or away. Understanding wicking materials is essential in helping to keep the foot dry in any orthotic or shoe treatment. 
<P><B>Fabrics.</B> Fabrics used for linings and topcovers in footwear are basically knit, woven, and nonwoven. Some fabrics are also heat embossed to help fuse the fibers together for dimensional stability. Most fabric linings and topcovers are warpknit synthetic fibers such as polyester, polypropylene, and orlon. One exception is Cambrelle, whose principal characteristic is its nonwoven construction and its resistance to abrasion, providing for increased wearability. 
<P>To varying degrees, all of these materials are basically hydrophobic, possessing an inability to absorb moisture. But for purposes of moisture control, we differentiate between hydrophobic and hydrophilic. Some fabrics, such as Aquator and Drilex, are "two-zone" types, combining both hydrophobic fibers with hydrophilic fibers. As such, they are engineered to create a "dry zone" against the skin, and a "reservoir zone" to transport moisture away from the skin. Moisture is then evaporated from both zones.
<P>Another way to increase moisture wicking is to maximize the surface area of a fabric's individual fibers, which increases the volume of moisture the fabric is able to transport away from the skin. For example, CoolMax is a hydrophobic polyester extruded into fibers with a non-circular design that increases the surface area around each fiber. Thus the same number of fibers in a CoolMax fabric possess a greater ability to pull moisture away from the skin's surface than a similar fabric without this design. For the same reason, ThermoStat and several other similar fabrics use hollow core fibers to increase the wicking per denier of fiber. 
<P>Microfiber yarns increase wicking capacity in their own special way. Two leaders in the microfiber field, Wellman and Hoechst-Celanese, have perfected the art of extruding fibers that are one-quarter the thickness of conventional fibers. Therefore, each spun fiber contains more filaments per denier, providing a far greater surface area for wicking. As a result, microfiber fabrics, such as AquaPore, Savoir Suede, and Magic not only wick well, but also possess a luxurious soft hand and excellent drape, much like silk. 
<P>Polypropylene has been used as a fiber for knitting because of its excellent hydrophobic properties, but problems with pilling and odor retention have significantly reduced its use and application in the manufacture of footwear.
<P><B>Top Treatments.</B> The top surface of many fabrics are treated after knitting to enhance their wicking quality. The idea is to create a fabric in which moisture spreads rapidly across the surface of the fabric so that is can be dissipated and eventually evaporate. In other words, moisture is literally transported away. MicroDry, for example, is made in part of polyester fibers, which are by nature hydrophobic but are treated to make only the outer skin of each fiber hydrophilic. After treatment, the core of each fiber refuses to accept and absorb moisture. The problem with this concept is that the micro-environment created by an enclosed shoe does not allow for the spreading moisture to evaporate until the shoe or boot is removed and exposed to air, thus eventually creating a broader surface area of wetness within the shoe.
<P><B>Foams.</B> Foams of the closed cell variety (polyethylene, vinyl acetate, latex, or skin sealed polyurethane) are neither breathable nor moisture permeable. All too often a performance fabric is laminated to one of these foams, causing a significant reduction in its wickability. Indeed, moisture is prevented from wicking through the fabric by the foam itself, which acts as a barrier. 
<P>A few of the foams in the polyurethane family are open-celled types, which allow for breathability and moisture permeability. Unless these foams are used in multiple layers, however, in my professional view they are too soft to provide for adequate cushioning underfoot. As a result, they collapse under impact pressure, forcing the absorbed moisture to be in continuous contact with the skin surface of the foot.
<P>A key to foot/shoe comfort is the mechanical ability of its materials to remove moisture from the vicinity of the foot/sock interface. Are we there? Not yet, but with advances in materials science, the future may be closer than you think.

<H1>Bivalve AFO for Charcot Osteoarthropathy</H1>
<P><I>by Roger Marzano, CP, C.PED</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Conservative management of an acute Charcot episode--with or without an ulcer--can be a time-consuming, labor-intensive task for the managing physician. While non-weightbearing total contact casting has been considered the gold standard of care, it may not be adequately reimbursed in some areas and can be hazardous for some patients because of their neuropathic or vascular status. An alternative to total contact casting is the custom fabricated bivalve ankle foot orthosis (AFO), which totally encloses and protects the foot and ankle while facilitating healing of the ulcer. In my experience, it has been used with limb-saving results and a high rate of patient compliance for Charcot episodes.
<P>The bivalve AFO has been used successfully on both acute and chronic phases of Charcot arthropathy. It also has been used for the management of diabetic ulcers associated with high pressure over bony prominences. Treatment protocol has been to apply a total contact cast on the extremity for edema management and bony stabilization. After one week or longer, a plaster impression is made of the patient's leg between cast changes for the fabrication of the AFO. This method ensures that the foot and ankle are not too edematous, thereby maximizing the intimate fit of the orthosis. Progressing from the total contact cast to the bivalved orthosis allows the foot and ankle to move from the unstable phase to the consolidation phase without interruption in support.
<P>Early use of the AFO decreases physician office time required for treatment of this pathology. For patients with ulcerations, the orthosis is easily removed for wound inspection, dressing changes, and debridement. In some cases, the severity of the deformity requires the patient to remain in the orthosis indefinitely, while others eventually wean themselves from the orthosis once bony consolidation and stabilization have been achieved. Even then, patients may elect to use the orthosis during periods of high activity or when navigating difficult terrain.
<P>Individuals who successfully wean themselves continue to use some sort of total contact foot orthosis and appropriate shoewear modified based upon their specific needs. This progression from cast, to bivalve, and subsequently to inserts and shoes, has been successful in managing this patient population.
<P>The AFO is designed to stabilize and partially unweight the foot and ankle to speed the healing process. This is achieved through proper impression and fabrication techniques. The device can be fit on patients with significant bony deformation of the foot and ankle, although these deformities rarely are reducible during the impression process and require accommodation rather than correction. As such, a partial weightbearing impression technique is recommended. To capture the often irregular plantar surface anatomy, a six-inch block of medium density cellular foam is placed under the foot, which has been wrapped in plaster or fiberglass.
<P>If open wounds are involved, a small sterile dressing is applied just over the perimeter of the wound and the entire area is enclosed in clear cellophane wrap to protect the wound from contamination. The presence of excessive edema in the extremity being casted also must be considered. If the foot and ankle are excessively swollen, an extremity pump can be used prior to the impression to reduce the excessive fluids.
<P>Stockinette is applied to the extremity in the usual manner, enclosing the toes up to the proximal border of the patella. All bony prominences and landmarks are labeled distal to the patella for patellar weightbearing modifications. A circumferential wrap (plaster or fiberglass) is applied with a cut-off strip running anteriorly. The patient's foot is placed upon the foam block and the patient is instructed to stand with the use of a walker for stability and weight reduction. The goal is to get the talocrural joint to 90 degrees, if possible, although in some cases this may be unobtainable. Once set, remove, seal, and fill the impression in the normal fashion.
<P>Modification of the positive model is similar to that of a PTB design AFO except a toe box must be applied to the cast with adequate room distally and dorsally to safely enclose the toes without impingement. A multidensity foot orthosis is first molded to the positive model with a rocker effect sanded into the bottom of the orthosis. Then, 1/4-inch soft foam liners are molded over the orthosis and cast both anteriorly and posteriorly with the seams running midline. Copolymer is then molded over the liners with the anterior molded over the posterior shell with approximately one-inch overlap. Four circumferential straps are then applied, with a rocker sole sanded into the crepe soling added to the bottom of the orthosis.
<P>When the patient is removed from the total contact cast and the bivalve AFO is applied, it is recommended that polypropylene ski socks be worn under the orthosis due to their superior wicking action and extra long length. If poor vascular status or hypersensitivity make this too restrictive, athletic cotton tube socks can be worn as long as the length is sufficient.
<P>Once the patient has donned the device, the rocker action of the orthosis should facilitate fairly normal ambulation. It is extremely important at this time to recognize and correct any leg length discrepancies. These discrepancies normally require a small elevation to the uninvolved side. Physical therapy consultation may be advisable if the patient shows signs of instability. Some patients elect to use a cane for added stability, but most are quite stable without any type of walking aid.
<P>The patient must wear the orthosis continually, only removing it for bathing, sleeping, and wound care or inspection. In some cases of extreme instability, physicians have ordered the device also to be worn during sleeping. The neuropathic status of the patients wearing the orthosis demands frequent removal (every two hours for the first few days) to inspect the leg for any pressure-related problems.
<P>Most patients find the device comfortable and easy to manage. A follow-up study performed to determine the efficacy of this treatment protocol for the management of Charcot osteoarthropathy reported a high rate of patient compliance and comfort, with a large number of wounds healed simultaneously. The results were presented last year at the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society summer meeting in Vail, Colorado. 
<P>Use of the bivalve ankle foot orthosis not only reduced the need for surgery and subsequent hospitalization, but also saved several compromised limbs. This has reduced the overall cost of managing this difficult pathology, which is definitely in line with today's healthcare climate.

<H1>Hydrotherapy for Lower Extremity Wounds</H1>
<P><I>by Joseph McCulloch, PT, PhD</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Reestablishing appropriate biomechanical function in the lower extremity can be profoundly complicated by a chronic lower extremity ulceration. Wound cleansing and healing often demand primary attention and over the years, physical therapists and others have utilized hydrotherapy--typically in the form of a whirlpool--for cleansing and debriding wounds.
<P>Full body immersion is often an effective way to cleanse multiple wound sites such as those encountered with burns. Patients with multiple pressure ulcers of the trochanters and sacrum often can also be rapidly treated with this method. 
<P>Once the whirlpool demonstrated effectiveness in managing multiple and extensive wounds of the trunk, it rapidly became a technique of choice in the treatment of wounds of the lower extremities. However, when an extremity treatment is performed, a major new variable enters the equation: the patient typically has to place the extremity into a dependent position to receive the treatment. The edema that potentially results can cause significant healing problems.
<P>The whirlpool is reported to have four commonly accepted effects: tissue hydration, cleansing, improved circulation, and the ability to debride loosely attached devitalized tissue. Seldom, though, is it desirous to have all four effects in a single treatment. In some situations, there may be no loosely attached tissue to remove. Instead, a dense eschar that is present may require aggressive sharp debridement. Or, at other times tissues may be overly moist and additional hydration may not be advantageous. Before a patient is placed in the whirlpool, the overall clinical objective must be established.
<P>The most common chronic lower extremity ulceration seen in clinical practice is caused by venous insufficiency. High ambulatory venous hypertension, secondary to an insufficient calf muscle pump and valvular dysfunction, produces the typical venous ulcer that occurs in the gaiter region of the ankle (just proximal to the medial malleolus). Most often, the venous insufficiency ulcer (previously termed venous stasis ulcer) presents as a moist, granulating wound with a densely attached layer of fibrinous slough. 
<P>Several theories exist to explain the pathogenesis of venous ulcerations. Most recently it has been suggested that the ulcer results from an ischemia/reperfusion phenomenon where free radicals are present in large numbers and cause significant tissue destruction. The ischemia in venous disease is frequently brought about by edema secondary to the dependent position. Therefore, it would not be prudent to place such an extremity into a warm whirlpool bath. The dependent position and warm water would only serve to encourage the accumulation of fluid in the venous system, thereby increasing venous hypertension and leakage of fluid into the interstitial space. Since venous ulcers are moist and often have densely adherent necrotic tissue, often all that is desired from hydrotherapy is a gentle cleansing of surface contaminants. As such, the venous ulcer could be treated more appropriately with gentle irrigation from a syringe or with one of the newer pulsed lavage devices that permit high and low pressure irrigation. Some are quite sophisticated and provide a full range of pressures graded in pounds per square inch. Other systems have the advantage of high portability through the use of self-contained batteries.

<P>The ischemic ulceration occurs often in the lower extremities. These ulcers occur as a result of poor arterial profusion of the tissues and attempts to improve circulation can promote wound healing. While a warm whirlpool can encourage vasodilation, the practitioner should be cautious in setting the agitation level. Forceful agitation could damage fragile granulation tissue and cause the patient some discomfort. Care also should be taken in setting the whirlpool temperature since the compromised vascular system cannot effectively handle an increased thermal load.
<P>Patients with diabetes frequently experience plantar ulcerations secondary to pressure and insensitivity. Whirlpools can be of some benefit in cleansing plantar ulcers but the length of time the extremity remains in the water should be monitored. Excessive hydration of the foot can lead to maceration of the hyperkeratotic periwound tissue. This tissue is then at risk for harboring bacteria which could in turn lead to wound infection. Often all that is necessary is to soak the diabetic foot for a few moments in a basin of warm water and cleanse the area with a mild soap.
<P>The mixed etiology ulcer can also be treated with hydrotherapy. It is not uncommon for patients to present with ulcerations that may appear on clinical observation to be secondary to venous insufficiency, but later are found actually to possess an arterial component. Since treatment for these two conditions is diametrically opposed, the clinician must determine which factor requires more attention. Perhaps a simple modification to treatment time may be all that is necessary. A warm bath could be used to influence arterial supply while a short treatment session could minimize the effects of dependent edema.
<P>While other forms of hydrotherapy offer benefits--including irrigation pressure control, ease of use, and portability--the traditional whirlpool still has a role to play in the management of open wounds. Yet, like all treatment options, the objective of the treatment first must be determined and the treatment variables then adjusted to accomplish these objectives.

<H1>Replacement Insoles</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
<H2><I>Put new comfort in your patient's older shoes--and even new shoes--with high-tech replacement insoles.</I></H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Original insoles in many shoes are flat, lifeless, and unsupportive. Lately, leading shoe manufacturers such as Ecco, Clarks, and Soft Spots are pushing the edges of footwear technology to develop sophisticated insoles that will distribute weight, dissipate shock, support the body, and promote good biomechanics. But even the best original insole will eventually bottom out or come apart. Patients can now purchase high-tech replacement insoles from retail outlets to stand in for unacceptable original insoles, or good insoles that have simply worn out. Some practitioners may even choose to dispense them. In some cases, the retail versions are identical to ones already in use by practitioners as a low-end enhancement or test device. Remember, with notable exceptions, these devices are essentially non-therapeutic. But they can make a real difference in your patient's comfort level and in defending against the elements that help create foot pathology.
<P>Replacement insoles are nothing new. Dr. Scholl's has earned millions by making its insoles inexpensive and abundantly available at retail racks everywhere. It made a real pioneering contribution to the public by leading the way toward better individual biomechanics. But today there are replacement insole offerings far beyond the simplistic devices produced by Dr. Scholl's. Companies such as Pedifix, IEM, Implus, Kiwi, Spenco, and many more have created highly engineered products that are much less available and less visible in the marketplace but certainly more desirable in my view. These brand names are much less known, but I prefer their devices to anything in the Scholl's line. 
<P>Matching the correct insole to the correct shoe is not easy. Replacement insoles are mass produced to hit the averages in human foot architecture and shoe construction. But every foot is different and so is every shoe. Original insoles are generally--with many notable exceptions--designed to be exceptionally thin. Not a few replacement insoles which deliver superior shock absorption are bulky, or at least thicker than the original. Moreover, an excellent replacement insole in an additional depth shoe may crowd a patient's foot in a shallow depth shoe. The type and thickness of the sock or stocking is vital. Is the patient wearing hosiery or sweat socks? And of course, what activity is involved: work, running, walking, office routine, dress-up? 
<P>The endless list of variables means that recommending different insoles for different shoe and sock combinations and activities is imperative. The patient's discomfort can easily be increased by making the wrong match. Fit is everything. And don't laugh, but many patients actually think replacement insoles go on top of the old ones like overlays. Hey, I said don't laugh. It's true. 
<P>A final caveat before reading my recommendations: the perfect comfort replacement insole for me may cause your patient pain--and vice versa. My preferences are based on my knowledge of the materials and construction, and my wear-testing. Your patient's experience is guaranteed to vary. Hence, my favorites are just that: my personal favorites for my personal foot under my specific shoe wearing conditions. That said: here is a selective guide to some of just a few of my personal favorites among the lesser known brands. 

<H3>Implus SofSole Athletes Plus</H3> 
These are wonderful on the feet and strangely enough, sweet to the nose. Implus is the high-tech company that accepted a crusading TV host's challenge to drop eggs onto its PVC-type material from 10 ft. up. The eggs remained intact, and Implus has been cashing in on the stunt ever since. Implus material absorbs up to 40 percent of ground forces transduced through a shoe, claims the company. 
<P>Athletes Plus, its top of the line product, comes with a full-length polyurethane layer, plus heel and metatarsal drops for added protection. Its perforated design allows for airflow. And impregnated biocide and sweet scent counteract foot order. When I say "counteract foot odor," I mean these devices are so pleasantly scented that people can actually discern the fragrance as you walk by. I recommend Athletes Plus for any athletic activity, especially running or performance walking. Trim to size. About $16.00.

<H3>Kiwi AirPro</H3> 
Kiwi uses a polyester foam bottom joined to an open-cell foam in a superior design to keep the foot cool under pressured circumstances, such as running or long sessions standings. An antimicrobial agent and hydrophilic moisture wicking polyester fabric topcover combats foot odor. With thicknesses of  just .34 inch at the heel, and .19 inch at the toe, AirPros are slightly thinner than similar polyurethane products. A recessed "heel pump" converts heel strike into air flow that theoretically squirts through a system of channels and perforations to keep the foot cool and dry. I wore them around the office for eight hours, and my feet felt as cool and comfy by day's end as the moment I slipped into them. About $12.95

<H3>Pedifix SoftStride</H3>
My favorite all-around comfort insole is a product that has long been used successfully within the biomechanics mainstream and known simply as the Replacement Shoe Insole. Pedifix is now adding this same medical quality replacement insole, renamed SoftStride, to its extensive line of retail foot care products. The SoftStride's exceptionally thin, molded full-length design will not crowd the toes. Two layers, urethane and polyethylene, are laminated beneath a soft polyester topcover, augmented by a small Poron heel insert for heel strike protection. The product may seem flimsy, but its durability of course depends upon use. Pedifix reports on and off use of a single pair for as long as two years. At its modest price, patients can afford to replace SoftStrides annually. If I have to pick one and only one, it's SoftStride. About $14.95.

<H3>SecondWind Cushioned Insole</H3>
If you want to experiment with a low-end, inexpensive molded polyurethane insole, SecondWind's basic Cushioned Insole is a good bet. I like it because it's so thin, it really mimics the footprint--excuse the expression--of the original insole. Its thickness is only 8.7 mm at the heel tapering to 4.5 mm under the ball of the foot and then 3mm at the forefoot. The SecondWind is extremely lightweight. Call it a disposable insole because the material will weaken after six months. But then again you can buy one for the price of a movie ticket. $7-$8.

<H3>Sorbothane II</H3>
I like two Sorbothane II models, made by a company called IEM. The Ultra Sole may be the best shock absorbing replacement on the market. The heavy and dense viscoelastic polymer controls, dissipates and isolates shock better than virtually any other product in its class. Added protection to the forefoot and heel has been designed in. Under lab conditions, this foam can absorb up to 94.7 percent of impact, the company claims. It's my number one choice for shock absorption and shock attenuation. Skid pads on the bottom provide better in-shoe stability. Additional cushioning is afforded by a topcover of breathable Poron. The 3/4-length Graphite Arch is made of graphite, a plastic impregnated with carbon fibers, under a topcover of Dri-Lex. To avoid foot compression, Ultra Sole and the Graphite Arch must be worn in shoes with fairly good depth, such as athletic shoes. $15.95 to $30.00 depending upon the model.

<H3>Spenco Orthotic Arch Support</H3> 
This product occupies the high-end of the removable insole spectrum with a device that crosses the line from "high-end insole" to "low-end prefab orthosis." Why? Because the Orthotic Arch Support is a sturdy closed cell neoprene layer atop its own plastic-like Zytel arch support. The arch support is even heat moldable in two minutes with boiling water, so you can customize it to the shape of the foot. Many healthcare practitioners, especially physical therapists and orthopedists, dispense this very product as a prefabricated orthosis, or recommend it to their patients as a temporary or low-end solution, or even a test orthosis prior to moving up to an actual prescription device. Not a few podiatrists use Spenco overlays as a cushioning topcover for rigid or semirigid custom orthoses. Patients should be discouraged from self-customizing without professional advice. $22-$25.

<H3>Spirakut Footfit</H3>
Talk about a neat product you never heard of, a little known Idaho company  named Spirakut has developed a wonderful Italian produced insole called Footfit. Footfit is premolded heel-to-forefoot polyethylene melded to a full-length EVA layer, topped by either leather or hydrophilic Cambrelle. A foam rubber heel pad is simply glued on and hopefully will not dislodge during rigorous use. This product features a premolded heel cradling shape that provides comfort and support. I can wear it for hours unaware that it is in the shoe. To make its product a success, this tiny company spent three years designing a snazzy retail box. And the package makes a real difference. While most retail insoles are sealed in a secure container (even those with an open "touch me" portal), the Footfit sits completely accessible in an open-face Velcro fastened cardboard box. Spirakut urges customers and patients to open the package and try a pair on to see how they fit. Unfortunately, this product will not be available until fall, and only then in limited distribution at sports shops and maybe some drug stores. The company promotes them for in-line skating, skiing, and other heavy duty athletic uses. Spirakut will also sell them to practitioners one pair at a time if you call 800-621-1657. $15-$22 depending upon the model.

<H3>Superfeet</H3>
Among the finest sports insoles is Superfeet, commonly available in general sports and ski shops, but also in many pedorthic facilities. Like the Spenco orthotic device, Superfeet also offers a hard plastic arch support. Superfeet however utilizes a foam, rather than neoprene, for its full-length top layer. Superfeet come in various versions targeted at running, skiing, and in-line skating. Tough heel stabilizers help seat the device within the shoe. This is a support product, and one that is clearly targeted at the heavy-duty sports enthusiast. Make sure your patient consults a practitioner, not just a store clerk, about selecting the correct Superfeet. About $20.

<P>Replacement insoles help extend the life and comfort level of any shoe, and can help a reasonably healthy foot stay that way. Knowing more about the original insole your patient is walking on now, and recommending the right replacement, is a great way to become more involved in the everyday biomechanical facts of your patient's life.

<H2>AOFAS holds high performance course</H2>
World class athlete Carl Lewis, world record holder Leroy Burrell, and Olympic coach Tom Tellez will be among 100 special guests participating in the Olympic-time seminar, "Foot and Ankle Injuries in the High Performance Athlete." The course, sponsored by the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society, will be held in Atlanta June 13-15, during the Olympic Trials. <P>"Many disabling problems of the foot and ankle, though very subtle in presentation, may be easily corrected through surgery or conservative means," explains Don Baxter, MD, co-chair of the event. "So it is important to recognize the early manifestation of serious problems."
<P>Topics to be presented include principles of rehabilitation for the athlete, athletic shoes and non-contact injuries, ankle sprains, ankle impingement, arthroscopic procedures, special considerations of the female athlete, and the use and abuse of orthoses. 
<P>Other leading orthopedists on the faculty include Carol Frey, MD, and G. James Sammarco, MD, both members of the <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> Board of Advisors.

<H2>PFOLA takes intelligent step</H2>
The Prescription Foot Orthotic Laboratory Association recently took an intelligent step toward gaining recognition by practitioners. PFOLA took a booth at the Midwest Podiatry Conference last month, and featured inexpensive but colorful logos of all its members. The collages represented several dozen labs, from the largest such as PAL, to some that few had ever heard of before. The organization is slowly feeling its way toward cross-specialty credibility.

<H2>Scholl College treating uninsured</H2>
Scholl College of Podiatric Medicine is making a critical difference to uninsured Chicagoans. Twice weekly, its Footcare for the Uninsured project offers no-cost care--everything from routine screening to surgery. Nearly 1.5 million Illinois residents lack basic insurance coverage. In some cases, the podiatrists rendering care are the only doctors these patients have seen for years. 
<P>The program, though, is hardly limited to indigent people. Many middle class working people also are seeking help under the program. For example, Tony Silansky, 56, an autopsy technician, had already lost a toe to a diabetes infection when he was referred to Scholl. Now for the first time, he enjoys weekly monitoring.
<P>The program enforces no means test. Indeed, Hollie Whitcup is a personal trainer who lives in Chicago's exclusive Gold Coast area. She sought help when she encountered a painful Morton's Neuroma as a result of ill-fitting, high-heeled, narrow-width shoes. Whitcup received cortisone shots, a pair of orthoses, and this fall will receive corrective surgery. 
<P>The program accepts community or professional referrals. However, only a limited number of Medicaid recipients are seen, undoubtedly because Illinois Medicaid recently eliminated most podiatric care.

<H2>Exerstriding</H2>
You may have seen those ads in walking or fitness magazines for the Exerstrider, which requires fitness walkers to push off on ski poles. As a result, asserts the company, you can burn "more than 23 percent more calories with no significant change in perceived rate of exertion." The Exerstrider, says inventor Tom Rutlin, nonetheless magnifies the cardiovascular benefits of walking by elevating heart rate by 11 bpm, causing a 12 percent increase in oxygen consumption, and boosting the walker's respiratory exchange ratio by 5 percent. A study citing as much appears in the April issue of <CITE>Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise</CITE>. 
<P>At the same time, says Rutlin, ground reaction forces are decreased by 10 percent at heel strike and 30 percent at toe-off. This data emerges from trials conducted at Michigan State University. 
<P>Despite all the benefits, Rutlin swears his bizarre looking Exerstriders do not constitute "a killer exercise." Exerstriding is "a powerful, but subtle exercise," he insists.

<H2>Errata</H2>
An article in the <CITE>BioMechanics Desk Reference</CITE> cited the price of XeroSox as about $20. The correct price range is $10.95 to $18.95.

<P>An article in the <CITE>BioMechanics Desk Reference</CITE> referred to RCH500 as commonly known as subortholen. By way of expansion, RTC, which imports subortholen from Germany, asserts that its product is different from RCH500. 

<P>The author identification of James Taillon, CO, who wrote the article <I>Lower Extremity Pediatric Bracing</I>, which appeared in the March issue, should read: James Taillon, CO, is a certified orthotist from Green Bay, Wisconsin, whose background includes study at New York University.

<H1>Walking Shoe Surey</H1>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1><I><B>Your patients will be making buying decisions about their foot health long before they ever arrive in your office. But you can help.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>

<P>Now that good weather has finally arrived, walking is back on the agenda. Walking as an activity can mean anything from a simple stroll to a fitness walk. It can be around the block or through the woods. Chances are your patients will walk in existing shoes that are not designed for walking, or will go out and buy a pair of walking shoes. In either case, will they make the right choice? 
<P>If the biomechanics mainstream is to become proactively involved in America's biomechanical health, they must be aware of the shoes patients buy. And practitioners must be versed in the special uses of shoes. Thus far, many in our field are sadly underinformed. Even athletic shoes follow trends and seasonal fashion fads, and it's often impossible to distinguish truly useful features from marketing hype. For many, it's easier just to default to a few well-known names: Rockport, SAS, and a few other favorites. But a company that makes excellent comfort shoes may make bad running shoes, or its women's models may be cheaply constructed even though the men's line is excellent. Or a company may design only for a narrow, high-arched foot. Some of the best walking shoes are made by companies whose names are unknown to many, such as Clarks of England which never advertises, or Ecco which hasn't returned our last 10 phone calls and didn't even send us a product photo, or Wilson which is only now venturing into the walking arena.
<P>That's why <CITE>Stride Magazine</CITE> in association with <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> created its selective Walking Shoe Survey, a reflection of a dozen of our personal favorites. First understand what our Survey isn't. It isn't a guide to comfort shoes, hiking shoes, occupational shoes, or a myriad of other shoe categories. These shoes are meant for walking. Walking is a very specific form of biomechanics, and therefore requires a shoe designed for that purpose. Until recently, walking shoes (as opposed to hiking or athletic shoes) was a sparse class. A few years ago, people mostly walked in athletic shoes. Rockport led the way with well-built shoes specifically designed and marketed for the walking phenomenon. American comfort and European manufacturers began to target the market as well. Now there's an explosion of walking models.
<P>Walking shoes are different. They must be designed for walking's specific heel-to-toe biomechanics. That means more protection and engineering for heel strike and more emphasis on a solid platform of roomy comfort and support. It also means creating a shoe that will serve walkers of all ages: from grandchild to grandparent.
<P>Our selection spans the walking gamut from a light meandering stroll wearing the Ecco Walker to a serious fitness walk wearing the Wilson Technical Walker. Space did not permit us to include all the shoes we like. No attempt at comprehensiveness was made. We wish the list could be three times longer. But this selective guide will give your patients a starting point in their shopping quest for the right shoe for the right type of walk at the right price. Hopefully, patients will acquire a variety of walking shoes that will suit wherever their mood, pace, and destination take them.
<P>How we chose our dozen favorites is not that dissimilar from how your patient would select them in a store. First, each of the shoes had to exemplify quality shoe design and construction. We looked for engineering, design innovation, a knowledgeable use of materials, removable insoles, multilayered shock absorption and support, roomy last, and of course an understanding of how a shoe must act and react to make it a walking shoe. In addition, every shoe had to be available in multiple lengths and widths, either using the American standard of lengths and widths or the Eurocomfort approach with gradations of size.
<P>But then a very personal process took over during wear testing. That process was dictated by the personal fit of the shoe and the architecture of our feet. Men's shoes were mostly reviewed by Edwin, who has a very wide and flat foot. Women's shoes were mostly reviewed by Elizabeth, who has a hard-to-fit high arch. Some shoes Edwin loved were terribly uncomfortable for Elizabeth. For example, Edwin loved the Wilson Technical Walker. Elizabeth hated it, even after trying its special insole enhancer for arch supports. On the other hand, our 11-year-old daughter, who has daddy's wide foot, also loved the Wilson.
<P>In some cases, Elizabeth insisted upon elevating a favorite comfort shoe to light walker status, such as with Soft Spots Supremes. Edwin did the same with the Ecco Walker which he uses fundamentally as a comfort shoe. The most important features we considered were comfort, support, and shock management at a price your patients can afford.

<P><B>Easy Spirit Journey</B>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe1.jpg" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="217">
<P>Good, solid comfort without any bells and whistles. These walking shoes got me up and down Mt. Sinai last summer in searing 115-degree heat. Shock absorption is provided by a dual-density flexible lightweight EVA midsole and a dual-density rubber outsole. The contoured removable insole can be washed, and/or replaced. The toebox is roomy, there's extra width in the ball of the foot, the heel collar is snug, padded and cuddly soft--in short, it's designed for a woman's foot. The array of fitting combinations--with five widths,  and in sizes ranging from 4 to 13--make it a godsend for hard-to-fit feet. 
<P><I>Women's sizes. Widths: AAA, AA, B, D, EE.  Size range: 4-13.</I>   


<P><B>Easy Spirit Inspiration</B> 
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe2.jpg" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="229">
<P>Inspiration is the new and improved big sister of Journey. Like the Easy Spirit Journey, the Inspiration offers good shock absorption, support and durability. It adds features such as a Dri-Lex moisture-wicking sock lining, an active carbon layer to minimize humidity and odor, a heel cup stabilizer and extra medial forefoot support. Better for the walker whose gait requires more stability and control. 
<P><I>Women's sizes. Widths: AAA, AA, B, D, EE. Size range: 4-13.</I> 


<P><B>NaturalSport Catalyst</B> 
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe3.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="98">
<P>The newest high-tech walker from NaturalSport is the Catalyst, which incorporates the company's C3+ aerobic walker technology. C3+ features a dual-density molded EVA midsole and the Cradle. The Cradle is an EVA outsole cushioning pad augmenting a "self-centering device" rebound pad for proper shock absorption, energy return and stability enhancement. Reflective heel piping anticipates night walking for the serious walker.  
<P><I>Women's Sizes.  Widths: N, M, W. Size range:  4-12.  Men's Sizes. Widths: N, M, W. Size range: 6-15.</I>


<P><B>Soft Spots Supremes</B>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe4.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="129">
<P>If you don't even want to feel the roadway, Soft Spots Supremes, with its multilayered cushioning system, is my favorite. Originally marketed and developed for nurses, Supremes has turned into a superb casual comfort  shoe that doubles as a light walking shoe for any woman. Extraordinary shock absorption in tandem with superior support starts with a cushioning polyurethane outsole that hosts a steel shank for longitudinal stability. PVC foam pads have been inserted at the toe, metatarsals and heel. All that is topped by a medium density PVC midsole. The insole itself is a three-layer moisture-wicking device with memory cradled in an EVA heel cup. That insole is treated with antimicrobial agents. A padded tongue along with D-ring lacing keeps the pressure off. 
<P><I>Women's sizes. Widths: SS, N, M, W, WW. Size range: 5-13. Now also available for men. Widths: M, W, WW. Size range: 7-13.</I>


<P><B>Rockport's Rocsports Women's Interval Walker</B>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe5.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="94">
<P>The Interval Walker is a truly original design from Rockport. It's basically a sock with a walking shoe built around it. Pure genius. You have to put it on to believe it. The Interval Walker sock-shoe includes all the features of a durable walking shoe: removable high density EVA insole, double heel counter, and lightweight EVA midsole, and two-piece rubber outsole. But this shoe, aimed at the fitness walker, is light as a feather. I barely felt it on my feet. 
<P><I>Women's sizes. Widths: N, M, W. Sizes range: 5-12.  Men's sizes. Widths: M, W. Sizes range: 6-15.</I>


<P><B>New Balance WW551</B>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe6.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="99">
<P>The WW551 is a relatively inexpensive shoe new this spring, that reflects a great deal of shoe engineering experience. Designed for fast-paced walkers seeking cardiovascular benefits, the WW551 has deeper flex grooves for more frequent and powerful toe-off. Its larger last, or shoe mold, makes this shoe deeper and therefore ready for orthotics, and more accommodating to the high-instep and narrow-heeled female walker. This is the shoe if you're going after the fast aerobic walk. The WW551 is one in a series of New Balance walkers for women. 
<P><I>Women's sizes. Widths: AA, B, D. Sizes range: 5-13.</I>


<P><B>Reebok RoadWalker DMX</B> 
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe7.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="158">
<P>An impressive bit of technology went into the advanced cushioning system in the RoadWalker DMX. Connected chambers in the midsole allow air to pump back and forth as you move through your gait cycle. In theory, this allows an extra cushion of air to shift to the exact part of the foot making contact with the ground. The stylish but athletic design makes this a shoe you'll choose when both looks and extreme comfort are important. 
<P><I>Women's size range: 5-12.  Men's size range:  6.5-15.</I>

<B>Clarks of England Glider</B> 
<IMG SRC="/graphics/mshoe1.jpg" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="97">
<P>An exquisitely supportive fitness walking shoe that protects the foot even over rough surfaces with a solid platform of support and shock absorption. A rubber outsole meets the road. Two additional layers absorb shock: a compression molded EVA midsole topped by a removable compression molded EVA insole. For support, count on a rigid heel counter and padded collar. A favorite when distance walking is on the program.  
<P><I>Men's Sizes. Widths: N, M, W. Size range: 7-13. Women's Sizes. Widths: N, M, W. Size range: 5-12.</I>


<P><B>Clarks of England Air Mover</B>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/mshoe2.jpg" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="86">
<P>My number one favorite casual walking shoe. The lacing system, a combination of D-rings and regular eyelets anchored from the midfoot area, creates a comfortable unpressured enclosure within a roomy toebox. Soft subtle snuffed oil leather is kind to the touch. What is surely one of the finest casual walking shock absorption systems only begins with a special leather-topped perforated polyurethane insole. The insole's underside is corrugated to fit precisely into a corrugated dual-density midsole featuring a foam filler augmented by an active air chamber. When I go for a long stroll after dinner or on weekend afternoons, I lace up my Air Movers. 
<P><I>Men's Sizes. Widths: M. Size range 7-13.</I> 

<P><B>Ecco World Wide Walker</B>
<P>Somewhere between a comfort shoe and a casual walker is the Ecco Walker. I wear Eccos when I take short strolls or attend seminars. Constructed of soft, lightweight oiled nubuck leather with a thick, rough non-pressuring lace, this Danish-made walker keeps my feet cool and absorbs simple ground reaction forces. The secret is roomy European design plus a three-prong comfort and cooling system. A polyurethane outsole supports a second polyurethane midsole capped by about a half inch of latex foam. Latex is hydrophobic, which means it traps moisture. But then a porous hydrophilic insole wicks that moisture away within about 24 hours. These shoes are fun to walk in. The Walker is also nature friendly: the outsole is freon-free and the insole is made of recycled fibers. 
<P><I>Men's Sizes 40-47 (European). Women's Sizes 35-42 (European).</I>


<P><B>Etonic Trans Am</B>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/mshoe4.jpg" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="116">
<P>One of Etonic's best light walkers is the Trans Am. A single density EVA midsole sits atop rugged solid rubber. The removable insole is an EVA with heel and arch support. An external heel stabilizer, a PVC heel counter and roomy toebox round out the shoe. The women's version is 1.2 ounces lighter than the men's. 
<P><I>Men's Sizes.  Widths: B, D, EE, EEEE. Size range: 6.5-13.  Women's Sizes. Widths: AA, B, D, EE. Size range 5-11.</I>


<P><B>Wilson Tech Walker</B>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/wshoe5.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="108">
<P>My number one performance walking shoe choice is the Wilson Technical Walker. The engineering that went into this shoe is a tribute to the public demand for a performance walking shoe. Note the word performance. The Technical Walker is a white walking shoe not to be taken lightly. Lace it up for heavy duty reasonably smooth surface walking, such as five miles down the jogging path, or into town from that country bed and breakfast. You barely feel the ground wearing these Wilsons. I have never felt so buoyant in a performance walker.
<P>The features of this high-tech walker are many. Start at the bottom. A sturdy plastic medial post resists pronation, that is, the natural rolling in of the foot when it contacts the ground. The rugged and gripping rubber outsole is made of Goodyear's Indy 500 Plus Max. The gimmicky looking green polyurethane heel insert really works, offering extra cushioning and energy return during heel strike, the foot's first contact during gait. Deep outsole grooves accommodate the flexing of toe-off. 
<P>Inside, you'll find a unique molded EVA insole topped with a terry-like fabric. I hate the word unique, but this is the first insole to come with a support attachment--two little latex "cookies" that fit into a dome designed to prop up the insole should it bottom out after a while, or should the walker have a higher arch. The cookies come on an attached card. 
<P>A pigskin heel strip helps avoid slippage. A padded tongue cushions the foot from lacing. The shoe could benefit from additional moisture control, so they may run warm. We hope to see that corrected in the next version, but for now, this is the best performance walker we've seen. 
<P><I>Men's Sizes. Widths: D, EE. Size range: 6.5-16. Women's Sizes. Widths AA, B, D. Size range 5-11.</I>

<B>Should You Walk in Running Shoes?</B>
</CENTER>
<P>Until recently many people undertook heavy duty walking in running shoes. Some biomechanics experts feel there is no difference. Others feel that properly engineered walking shoes are better for the gait characteristics of walking, especially since running shoes are designed for far greater flexing. Paul Taylor, DPM, a former president of the American College of Podiatric Sports Medicine and a former consultant to Rockport, believes that those who walk but do not run benefit from a walking shoe over a running shoe. Dr. Taylor also believes that those who have given up running to concentrate on walking will do just as well if they continue wearing their favorite running models.

</CENTER>
<P>A potential partnership is looming. It's by no means real at this point, but if both sides keep at it, a genuine alliance may occur with extraordinary dividends for America's lower extremity health. I am referring to a possible partnership between the biomechanics mainstream and sensible segments of the shoe industry. 
<P>Millions of Americans are suffering the ill effects of unhealthy shoe design and purchase. But if the biomechanics mainstream could become involved before damage is done, the public would reap enormous benefits. Imagine advising the shoe industry to improve footwear design, working with retailers to carry biomechanically correct shoes, and counseling patients to shop intelligently. 
<P>The precedents are everywhere. The healthcare establishment long ago took a proactive stance on issues such as smoking, seat belts, fitness, weight loss, and nutrition, demanding change from corporate America, lobbying the government, giving green lights to the good guys, and motivating the patient base to act smart. The same opportunities exist for footwear.
<P>The clich&eacute; "consult your doctor" that accompanies so many fitness, weight loss, and nutritional transactions could easily apply to all types of shoes: athletic, work, comfort and walking shoes, and even dress and fashion shoes. The need goes well beyond the obvious therapeutic cases, such as diabetic, arthritic, and post-trauma or postsurgical patients. It extends to healthy pre-pathology patients. The healthcare establishment now counsels good nutrition, fitness, dental care, and eyecare before a problem develops. Why not do the same for the nation's hip to toe welfare? 
<P>But unlike the generalizations that serve the nutrition and fitness realms, shoe biomechanics require individual assessment and a personal match to a specific shoe model. Which shoes are right for which foot type, to accommodate which foot, knee, and low back problems, to protect against which environments, and to be useful under what circumstances varies from person to person. Every foot is different. Every shoe decision will be different. Eventually, all professional society-recommended shoes may receive recognizable classifications, and knowing patients would receive pre-shopping counsel. 
<P>This partnership-to-be would be lucky if it solidifies before the next century. But certainly, the foundation is there. The American Podiatric Medical Association's well-established Seal of Acceptance has been sought after because shoe companies understand the value the public attaches to such recognition. But the APMA Seal is one of general acceptance, not testing. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society has ramped up a much-publicized test-oriented Seal of Endorsement that many in the athletic and comfort shoe industry are flocking to, while many in fashion footwear are energetically resisting. Both these programs have a long way to go, but should only be a pre-qualifier to a genuinely individualized patient assessment. Unless the shoe fits, the practitioner should not recommend it, seal or no seal. 
<P>The shoe industry is seeking professional endorsement out of self-interest. Fine, that's a good motivator in corporate America, but one which practitioners should understand as they demand better biomechanics, better consumer education, and more involvement from design to retail.

<HR>
<P>For centuries, immobilization has been used to treat a variety of musculoskeletal disorders. However, despite immobilization's well known benefits, limitations prohibit its use in some situations. Prolonged immobilization (lasting more than two months), combined with non-weightbearing, results in significant stiffness and severe disuse osteopenia. A removable device--the half-cast--can be used instead to functionally brace the foot and ankle.
<P>Half-cast immobilization involves placing a standard short leg fiberglass walking cast and removing the anterior half of the shell. This allows the cast to be removed by the patient for gentle range-of-motion exercise. The half-cast is kept in place with an ace bandage and is padded with two stockinettes.
<P>Half-casting is economical, lightweight, comfortable, and custom fit to each patient. While off-the-shelf functional braces have become a popular approach to fracture care and post-operative immobilization, half-casting offers the same advantages of functional bracing, yet is less expensive and provides a more customized fit. We certainly still use off-the-shelf functional braces, but we prefer to use the half-cast earlier in the recovery period, which seems to work better as a transition from casting to functional bracing.
<P>We have treated more than 300 patients with the half-cast and they have been pleased with its comfortable, lightweight fit. The half-cast has been used in both the non-operative and post-operative treatment of numerous sports and orthopedic conditions, including open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) ankle fractures (post-op); ORIF foot (e.g., lisfranc); 5th metatarsal fractures (post-op); plantar fasciitis (non-op); Achilles tendon repair (post-op); repair or reconstruction of ligaments and tendons in the foot (post-op); management of diabetic foot ulcers (non-op and post-op); and stress fractures of the foot (non-op and post-op).
<P>Patients are more certain of the half-cast's stability than they are with functional bracing, yet they still have a removable device. Inspection and care for any existing wounds also are facilitated. The half-cast is suggested for claustrophobic patients who simply can't tolerate a conventional cast. Patients are also able to maintain proper hygiene. Patient compliance is high because the device is easy to apply, lightweight, and comfortable. Additionally, the cast is not circumferential and the risk of soft tissue problems that may arise from a too-tight cast decreases. That is, the half-cast can accommodate post-operative and post-injury swelling.
<P>Alternative applications for the half-cast include retaining both the anterior shell and the posterior half with ace bandages in cases where more stability is required. This approach has been successful in treating diabetic foot ulcer patients and is also used in some immediate post-operative patients to provide excellent stability while still allowing for an expected amount of post-operative swelling.
<P>Patient selection is required for half-cast application. However, half-casting has been used in many clinical settings and most socioeconomic situations. If the patient is too unreliable for a removable device, half-casting would be inappropriate. 
<P>Over the years, we have used traditional full casting in many clinical situations with considerable success. However, in our experience, 75 percent of these past treatments were conditions for the half-cast. A full cast in the initial post-operative course is still used when external pins are used to augment fixation or when the foot and ankle will not be put through ROM exercise because of concerns with the skin. External pins may be irritated by removing and replacing the half-cast. This is particularly true after cases of midfoot and hindfoot fusions.
<P>Our primary purpose in using half-casts is to reduce the long and short term disability resulting from continuous immobilization in a non-removable full cast. In our experience, rehabilitation is quicker after half-cast intermittent immobilization when compared to full casting.

<H1>Articulated Feet for Active Teens</H1>
<P><I>by Todd F. Anderson, CP
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Articulation and dynamic response are the essential ingredients when fitting teenagers with limb deficiencies.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>The teenage years are hard enough with peer pressure, academic demands, the search for an identity, and social acceptance. Add a limb deficiency to this equation and a teen's life can become even more complicated. Teens with limb deficiencies want to fit in just like any other kid, without regard to their handicap. Prosthetists must create a prosthesis that will give them that opportunity.
<P>There are four key factors to consider when selecting a prosthesis for an active teen:
<P><B>Aesthetics.</B> 
<UL>How important is it to the teenager that the prosthesis look like a real limb? Does this choice change the prosthetic options in any way? For some teens with limb deficiencies, cosmesis is very important and can be critical to developing self-esteem and confidence. For others, cosmesis may be less of a concern and the individual may prefer the unfinished "high tech" look.</UL>
<P><B>Function.</B> 
<UL>What does the patient do 90 percent of the time, and will the components selected be appropriate for the other 10 percent as well? Do we have components that will meet all the patient's needs? Ideally, we would like to provide a prosthesis that meets the patient's needs 100 percent of the time; realistically, we know that's not possible.</UL>
<P><B>Durability.</B> 
<UL>Will the selected components be durable enough for this patient? What types of failure can be expected? What is the repair turnaround time? At times, it appears that teenagers with limb deficiencies exist to test the limits and breaking points of their components. The question really is not how can we prevent damage and breakage, but how fast can we repair it?</UL>
<P><B>Comfort.</B> 
<UL>How can we provide comfort without skin or tissue breakdown? An uncomfortable socket will not stop a teen from being active, but it will cause breakdown. This can result in frustrating downtime for the patient, a situation that can be devastating for a teenager who may have to break a date or come out of an important game because the prosthesis is uncomfortable.</UL>

<H2>Articulated Feet</H2>
When all the elements are considered, the prosthesis selected should have as minimal influence as possible on the teenager's lifestyle. Our prosthetic team theorized that a limb deficient person could most closely simulate "normal" biomechanical gait by using prosthetic componentry designed to function like the anatomical foot. As such, we set out to answer the question: Will the active limb deficient teenager benefit from the use of an adjustable, ankle-jointed, dynamic response foot?
<P>We determined that College Park's TruStep foot appeared to provide the main characteristics we had identified for optimal function: shock absorption at initial contact and loading response; dynamic stability during mid-stance and terminal stance; and propulsion during pre-swing. That these characteristics could be fine-tuned for each patient also was appealing.
<P>The TruStep foot consists of three bones--the heel, ankle, and forefoot--connected by two pins. The motion of the foot is controlled by a series of bumpers and bushings strategically placed between the bones. The final component is a cosmetic foot shell applied over the endoskeleton. This modular foot allows for components to be exchanged to accommodate growth or weight change--an advantageous feature when working with rapidly growing teens.
<P>Nineteen below knee patients who previously wore a dynamic response foot were randomly fit with a College Park TruStep foot to evaluate it for function and practicality on young active patients. After approximately six months, a survey was sent to each patient for subjective feedback. Patients also were given the opportunity to return to their previous foot if they so desired. In addition, the prosthetists involved with the patients were questioned about their impressions of the foot.
<P>Our patients were 13 males (ranging in age from nine to 18) and six females (ranging in age from 14 to 18). All were unilateral below knee amputees, and included patients with congenital fibular deficiencies who had been converted to Symes or Boyd amputations. Foot sizes ranged from 23 to 28 cm. Fourteen patients previously wore a Seattle Light Foot and two were switched from a Flex Foot. Twelve patients were rated at a very high activity level, two in a high activity level, and two in a moderate activity level.
<P>Eleven males and five females returned surveys, resulting in an 84 percent overall return rate. Here are the results, along with some comments from the respondents:
<P><B>1. How does the new foot compare to the foot you had before?</B> Seven patients responded "better," nine responded "much better." Comments received included: "much better when it wasn't broken...," "...much more functional," "...feels more natural." The kids liked the change, but we still needed to know why.
<P><B>2. How is walking with your new foot compared to your old foot?</B> Ten patients responded "better," six said "much better." Comments included: "easier time walking," "...a lot easier walking up hills," "every step is smoother."
<P><B>3. How do you like running (easier, faster, smoother) with your new foot compared to your old foot?</B> Two patients answered "same," four answered "better," and nine answered "much better." One patient did not answer because she had not tried running. Comments included: "smoother," "...feels more like a real foot," "...not as jerky," and" ...easier on my stump."
<P><B>4. How has your activity level changed since you first got the new foot?</B> The results were 10 responses for "same," four at "higher," and two at "much higher." Comments included: "...always been active." "...fewer problems with sores and breakdown," and "...I can't be more active." After reviewing these responses, we concluded these teenagers would be active no matter which components were selected. The key is to select components that allow them to be even more active without being limited by the prosthesis.
<P><B>5. How important is it to you that your artificial foot look like a real foot?</B> The responses were three "very unimportant," one "unimportant," four "neutral," three "important," and five "very important." Clearly, this individualized preference can add or detract from the patient's overall functional assessment.
<P><B>6. Rate the way the new foot looks.</B> Very ugly: zero; ugly: one; OK.: five; good: eight; and great: two; were the responses. Comments included: "skin color too light," "toes too straight across," "from summer camping ... fall hunting ... it has been worn down," "...I like the looks of my old foot better," "...looks very real."
<P><B>7. Overall, how much do you like your new foot compared to old feet you have had?</B> The results were one at "same," eight "better," and seven "much better." Comments included: "better, but it needs to be repaired a lot ... old foot didn't," "I've only had two, and they pretty much function the same way." "It's a lot less noticeable," "...great for activities that require more foot movements" and "easier to be active." 
<P><B>8. What do you like most about the new foot?</B> Answers included: "...flexibility in different directions...," "I can run faster (two)," "...moves all around," "...the way it moves when not on a flat floor," "...how natural and realistic it feels," "...it doesn't seem so stiff," "...the ankle (two)," "...freedom it gives you when you run or walk," "it really makes moving around smoother," "...moves better, " "...natural flex," "looks real," "...provides more spring." "...easier to run," "...I can tell it's like a spring action," I have more of a bounce," "...I can jump better." The responses indicate that the patients appreciated the articulating qualities of this foot.
<P><B>9. What do you dislike about the new foot?</B> Most responses had to do with the maintenance problems and noise from the foot. Three patients said they did not dislike anything about the new foot.
<P><B>10. Would you like to continue with this foot or go back to your previous foot?</B> All patients requested to continue with this foot. However, several patients qualified their responses with comments such as "...if you can eliminate the maintenance problems" or "...as long as it doesn't click/squeak." One patient later did go back to a Seattle LightFoot because of the noise. Another patient decided to return to the Flex Foot because it was more dynamic for specific athletic applications.
<P><B>11. Compared to your old foot, how many broken or failed parts have you had with the new foot?</B> Many more: one; more: two; same: five; less: five; and much less: three; were the responses. Crushed bumpers and worn out foot shells were the main complaints cited. 
<P>In our experience, there is not a foot manufactured that an active teen cannot break. The key factor is that the failures should not be catastrophic and this foot had no more of these failures than any other foot we use.
<P><B>12. Rate the overall function of your new foot.</B> The results were: very bad: zero; bad: zero; OK.: one; good: four; and very good: 11. Comments included: ..."very comfortable," "...good foot," "...most functional foot, best working foot I've had," "...needs to be made tougher or won't hold up," and "...if it didn't click it would be very good."
<P>From the prosthetists we discovered that the TruStep foot requires more maintenance than other feet we use. The most common repair--changing bumpers and foot shells--is straightforward and not difficult. The multiple number of components and combinations of this foot give the initial impression that it would be difficult to work with. However, we found it easy to maintain. Even the most complex repair only takes 10-15 minutes if parts are on hand. Additionally, College Park recently created a tool that allows most maintenance to be performed without even doffing the prosthesis. 
<P>Limitations of the foot include the relatively short life of the bumpers and the inability of many patients to perform their own maintenance. Recently the manufacturer introduced a more durable bumper material it hopes will reduce noise and maintenance. However, six month follow-up appointments are still recommended.
<P>In our experience, the College Park also is very adaptive. Prosthetists may fine-tune the foot during dynamic alignment to suit patient needs. The practitioner can change the feel of the foot without changing the critical relationship between the socket and the foot with regard to socket angles and the patient's weightbearing line. This is accomplished by changing the combination of bumpers, which come in a variety of durometers. Patients especially appreciate the dynamic stability they feel during mid-stance.
<P>Since the subjective feedback is generally positive, the prosthetist feedback is positive, and we have no more catastrophic failures with this foot than with any other foot, we will continue to offer this foot as an option to our active teenage (and almost teenage) patients. Articulation and dynamic response are essential ingredients necessary to provide the three main clinical characteristics previously described. By optimizing these functions, in our professional opinion, teenagers can choose the avocation they desire without regard to their limb deficiency.

<H1>To Control or Not to Control:
<BR>That is the Question</H1>
<P><I>by Sheldon Langer, DPM</I>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Controlling abnormal function does not, in and of itself, lie in the rigidity or flexibility of an orthosis.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>In the early 1960's, Dr. Merton Root introduced his concept of biomechanics--an organized, rational approach to normal and abnormal function of the feet and the effect of lower extremity pathomechanics on the superstructure. At that time, the only acceptable thermoformable material used to create an orthotic device was Rohadur. It was a frame-casted methylmothracylate compound produced in sheets of thicknesses ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 mm. The material was exceptionally strong and fracture resistant, yet fully moldable when heated to a rubbery consistency. Although it is no longer manufactured, Rohadur is still a leading standard against which all other foot orthotic materials are measured.
<P>Dr. Root's concept of orthotic control was to create an orthotic device that would allow the foot to move unrestricted through normal ranges of motion while preventing it from compensating abnormally for intrinsic structural foot abnormalities and intrinsic or extrinsic functional abnormalities or malalignments. Used in this context, compensation is defined as a change of structure, position, or function of one part of the body in an attempt to adjust for a deviation of structure, position, or function of another part of the body. Compensation occurring in the foot can be normal or abnormal.
<P>Normal compensation is foot motion that adjusts for irregularities of the supporting terrain or for deviations in the position of any part of the trunk or lower extremities. Normal compensation by the foot is necessary to maintain postural equilibrium. It is generally momentary and non-persistent and produces no abnormality or deformity. In contrast, abnormal compensation is movement and alignment the foot employs to adjust for abnormal structure or function of the lower extremity or superstructure. Structural or positional abnormalities create a recurrent to persistent demand for compensation that may result in pathology.
<P>Normal and abnormal compensation of the foot are accomplished by pronation or supination of the subtalar and/or the midtarsal joint. However, the subtalar joint is the primary joint responsible for compensation. The triplane compensatory motion that occurs in both the subtalar and midtarsal joints is frequently the cause of abnormal function and pathology. Consequently, we seek to control abnormal function with foot orthoses.
<P>Unfortunately, most practitioners who specialize in treating biomechanical problems of the feet equate the ability of orthoses to control abnormal foot compensation with their rigidity. To compound the problem, a variety of so-called Rohadur substitutes have emerged, consisting of a variety of graphite compounds and laminates, layup fiberglass, nylon impregnated matrices, and hi-impact acrylics. These all imply the same amount of rigidity as Rohadur but with less bulk. An appropriate response might be: "So what?"
<P>Some patients experience relief of their symptoms when they use supposedly non-controlling, flexible, or accommodative orthoses, thereby attesting to some unexpected level of adequate control. Yet other patients treated with so-called "rigid orthoses" have not experienced relief of their biomechanically-caused symptoms and have been unable to tolerate even the most fastidiously fabricated custom made orthoses. This is frustrating for both patient and practitioner. Clearly, controlling abnormal foot function does not, in and of itself, lie in the rigidity or flexibility of an orthotic shell.
<P>A number of key factors must be considered when deciding whether to control or not. First, practitioners should ask: "Is my patient's abnormal foot function, in fact, controllable?" It is wrong to assume that an orthosis will be a panacea or that a patient even will be capable of accepting orthotic control.
<P>Obviously, the first step is to perform a biomechanical evaluation. This means not only looking for obvious structural deformities and malalignments, but also for the more obscure factors such as equinus influences or factors extrinsic to the foot. Equinus influences that cause compensation are generally irresistible; that is, they are so severe they defy orthotic therapy--unless they are recognized and addressed appropriately. Patients with a structural gastrocnemius equinus influence tend to tolerate orthoses poorly. They may slide off of the devices or flatten them prematurely if the orthoses are made from a semirigid material, thereby compromising any value they may have had. If the orthoses are made from a rigid material, gastrocnemius equinus patients often fracture them. Worse yet, if they don't fracture the orthoses and somehow continue to wear them, knee and leg problems such as infrapatellar tendonitis and genu recurvatum may ensue. In these cases, control of foot pathomechanics depends not only on the orthotic shell, but also on the recognition that these patients require either an appropriate amount of heel raise on the device or possibly surgical intervention. Clearly, other equinus influences--including osseous equinus and forefoot equinus--also must be considered. Again, appropriate measures should be taken to address the likelihood of achieving satisfactory orthotic control, if at all.
<P>In evaluating whether orthotic control is attainable, practitioners must also consider the paradox of apparent but overlooked extrinsic factors. The most common of these is a wide base of gait due to obesity, postural disequilibrium, genu valgum, abducted gait, or torsional abnormalities. Essentially, the wider than normal base of gait created by these conditions causes the center of gravity to fall more medial to the center of the subtalar joint. This, in turn, creates a significant pronatory lever arm that causes the subtalar joint to pronate more rapidly and severely since there is no resisting counterforce. For example, consider the case of a patient who presents with significant genu valgum and acute heel spur syndrome/plantar fasciitis. As part of a treatment program, many practitioners often place controlling (low-Dye) adhesive strappings on their patients, and the patients often experience significant relief of their pain. Can a practitioner now assume that "controlling" orthoses will be effective for this patient after ruling out any abnormalities that might include equinus influences, abnormal range of motion, neuroma, and leg length discrepancy? If the strapping was capable of controlling the foot pathomechanics that caused the plantar fasciitis, why wouldn't "controlling" orthotic devices accomplish the same thing?
<P>The practitioner cannot make this assumption. Clearly, adhesive tape strapping provides the most aggressive, positive control of foot function. In short, the foot cannot slide out of the adhesive tape strapping. The foot can and does, however, slide out of or off of the foot orthotic system when extrinsic leg factors come into play. In these instances, something more is required. "Something more" often lies outside of or extrinsic to the orthosis itself. Thus, to resist the abnormal compensatory subtalar joint pronation and ultimately midtarsal joint compensation, the orthosis would have to possess rearfoot posts that extend medially by at least 1/4 to 1/2 inch simply to provide a resisting force to the medially displaced center of gravity. Unfortunately, the shape and space limitations of the heel seat of a shoe preclude the placement of such a posted appliance into the shoe. And, increasing the number of degrees of the rearfoot post would do little if anything to address this problem. Instead, the answer lies extrinsic to the orthosis, meaning that the shoe in which a standard orthotic device is placed should have medial flare or extension added to the sole material in the area of the heal seat. This shoe modification, sometimes referred to as a medial buttress, is extremely effective in providing the pronation--resisting counterforce that the orthosis cannot provide, regardless of the rigidity or flexibility of the orthotic shell.
<P>Many practitioners have adopted a sliding scale for orthotic control with a range of classifications such as:
<UL>1. fully controlling
<BR>2. semi-controlling 
<BR>3. accommodative 
<BR>4. shock absorbing 
<BR>5. combinations of the above</UL> 
<BR>In a recent article, John Pagliano, DPM, pointed out that a lightweight 120-lb. cross country runner with a hypermobile foot and forefoot and rearfoot varus deformity may require fully controlling orthoses. On the other hand, a 350-lb. tackle with a rigid cavus foot may require nothing more than accommodative or shock absorbing orthoses. The point is clear: shy away from giving larger athletes heavier (by inference, more controlling) orthoses and lighter-weight athletes lighter-weight (by inference, less controlling) orthoses. A system of biomechanically correct orthoses suited to the individual--not preordained--must be followed.
<P>Also key to determining whether to control or not is the activity the patient engages in that is most likely to be the cause of the immediate complaint. The practitioner should ask: "Can an orthotic device 'control' under certain circumstances. If so, how?" For example, dress orthoses in high heel shoes probably do not function to control subtalar joint pronation since the contact phase is shortened from 27 percent to about 9 percent or less of the stance phase of gait. So, why do dress orthoses made of semi-flexible materials often provide significant relief of symptoms? The answer is because they might tend to reduce the amount of midtarsal joint collapse by providing a level of support to the medial longitudinal arch, thereby reducing forces in the forefoot. Similarly, sprinters with virtually no heel contact in running may do better in soft, shock absorbing, flexible orthoses than they would in rigid rearfoot posted devices.
<P>Finally, if the practitioner decides control is necessary for a particular patient, be positive. Use extrinsic rearfoot posts whenever possible. Do not use intrinsic forefoot posts on semirigid materials. It is a well established fact that even so called rigid materials flex under stress. Therefore, it should be obvious that intrinsic forefoot posts built into semirigid devices will flex out and compromise the control of forefoot deformities. Use extrinsic forefoot posts instead. Other shell modifications that provide additional positive control are deep heel seats, medial and lateral flanges, decelerator posts, and inverted cast techniques. It is important to know when and how to use them when the question is: "To control or not to control."

<H1>The Bergmann Scanner: 2001 and Beyond</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin Black

</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>When the automated orthosis field talks about foot scanners, they deal with a standard established not by a loud, flashy company eager to sell systems, but by a quiet, reserved commercial effort executed with little fanfare by Bergmann Orthotic Laboratories and more precisely under the personal micro-management of John Bergmann, DPM. Yet, because Dr. Bergmann is a subdued marketer, people often fail to recognize that no office-based optical foot scanning system has more experience under its laser than Dr. Bergmann's.
<P>The Bergmann Scanner does everything but make iced coffee. It hooks up to any standard PC. First, the device scans the patient's foot in four seconds either in true weightbearing mode using a floor device, non-weightbearing in the classic stick-your-foot-up-here pose, or semi-weightbearing from a chair. The computer monitor then yields a three-dimensional foot mapped image. That image can be manipulated by the practitioner to add all postings and other modifications. You can even function remotely in Bergmann's suburban Chicago facility by tapping in via modem, adjusting your device on-screen, and then sending it off to the fabrication queue. Or the same adjustments can be done from your own office prior to modeming. Some use the scanner just to make positives and then fabricate the final device in their own office. 
<P>"All information is archived," explains Dr. Bergmann. "We can overlay scans from one year to the next to see if there has been a change in the foot for a new orthosis. This is more than just a foot scanner. It's a diagnostic and imaging tool for wounds and ulceration. You can use it to measure depth and width of any foot structure, or even create therapeutic or comfort shoes." Indeed, Dr. Bergmann says discussions on using his scanner to create custom shoes will come to fruition by year's end.
<P>Bergmann's scanner compatibility is currently limited to his laboratory. In other words, when you buy into the scanner, you basically buy into Bergmann Orthotic Laboratory, where the devices are fabricated using industrial level CAD-CAM technology. Unlike many other automated labs, Bergmann Orthotic Laboratory does not limit itself to polypropylene cutouts. The lab boasts that the system can fabricate with any material, from polypro to leather, from functional to accommodative. Dr. Bergmann says he is prepared to open his software's architecture to make his scanner compatible with other automated labs, such as Bloch and Piedmont. 
<P>The prior generation Bergmann 2000 was originally built using the Cyberware 3-D Scanner, which is the same device that created all those wild special movie effects in Terminator II and The Abyss. Cyberware's abilities go far beyond the foot. Indeed the Bergmann 2000 scanner is being used for diagnostics at a VA Hospital and elsewhere for custom shoe evaluation. It could easily scan your face and create a mask. But remember, it's only hardware. It's Bergmann's deftly coded software based on years of experience both as a practitioner and custom lab operator that make this a valuable package. 
<P>Dr. Bergmann is driven by two things: an obsession with biomechanical excellence and a determination to do things his way or no way. Although his high-end scanner has been available for about seven years and was the first and only contender until this year, Dr. Bergmann failed to gain significant market entry. Only 24 of those original scanners sold. Installations include Brigham Young University for non-foot imaging, Niles Air Force Base, a private hospital in Texas, a VA Hospital, two podiatry colleges, and the rest are in podiatry practices.
<P>Why a user base of only 24 in seven years? Five reasons: 1) because of its high-end technology, at about $10,000 the scanner was priced too high and perhaps entered too early for the market; 2) the market was unfairly distracted year after year by an incessant campaign by ADT (under its former management) claiming a less expensive scanner linked to all the various ADT orthotic laboratories would become available any minute. It never did; 3) Dr. Bergmann wanted to go slow to get enough orthotic experience to make sure his system was working reliably. 4) Dr. Bergmann limited his scope to podiatry, initially refusing to market to other healthcare segments; and 5) Dr. Bergmann's marketing was so subdued that many opportunities passed him by. 
<P>But all that may be over now as Dr. Bergmann readies a new, trimmer, less expensive scanner, the 2001, to replace his original 2000. The new 2001 scanner, the fourth generation, will offer most of the features of its big brother and sell for just $8,250. That directly competes with Benefoot's ScanCast and the Amfit contact digitizer. The first 20 Bergmann 2001 units are being machined now and should be available in July. Many of those first 20 are already pre-sold. Dr. Bergmann doesn't expect the remainder to last long and hopes to resume manufacturing soon. 
<P>Cyberware no longer provides the hardware; a member of the Bergmann enterprise builds the scanners. Hence costs will be kept down and market demand can be satisfied more easily. A member of the Bergmann development team told BioMechanics, "We're over the hump of availability and pricing. I think it will sell much better than it has. Pricing is quite a bit less. Our numbers will double within a year."
<P>Whether Dr. Bergmann is willing to come out of his marketing shell will prove as important as the technology itself. To be successful, technology requires a broad user base--a lot more than a few dozen souls. The next six months will tell the story.

<H1>Orthotic Materials Dealer List</H1>

<P><I>Compiled by Tracy Goodman</I>
</CENTER>

<P>There are so many orthotic materials available, practitioners need help keeping track of which dealer offers which material in which format: sheets, rolls or premolds. The information is complicated by trade names that are virtually the same as the generic but privately labelled for better discounts. To assemble this list, we asked materials dealers to provide a list of top products--not necessarily their best sellers, but perhaps their most important ones. We used the names provided, including established private labels. Our list is imperfect because many dealers have their special variations.

<H1>Surgical Reconstruction: An Alternative to BK Amputation</H1>
<P><I>by Stephen F. Conti, MD &#38; G. James Sammarco, MD  

</CENTER>

<P>Care of diabetic foot problems has changed dramatically during the last 10 years. New information has provided a clearer understanding of the pathophysiology of neuropathic diseases and allowed better recognition of the foot at risk for ulceration, neuroarthropathy, and vascular insufficiency. Unfortunately, patients and primary healthcare providers still have not been completely and properly educated, and we continue to see patients presenting with significant late foot deformity. Surgical treatment is now emerging as a viable option to salvage many of these feet, and early results are encouraging. Careful patient selection and experienced surgical management have resulted in functional outcomes for many patients whose only previous option would have been below knee amputation.
<P>Surgical reconstruction of severe neuropathic foot deformity is considered in patients with recurrent ulceration not amenable to exostectomy, in those with instability and, lastly, in patients with severe deformity that markedly impairs ambulation. This last indication may be the most important and the least understood. The physician--in consultation with the patient--must weigh the benefits of tissue conservation against the immediate functional gains from prosthetic use. The operative stress of reconstruction, including anesthesia time and blood loss, is approximately the same as amputation. The main difference exists in the short postoperative recovery period following amputation (three weeks to ambulation) compared to reconstruction (six months to ambulation). At the same time, the short term gains of amputation and prosthetic fitting may not translate into long term stable results considering that each year the contralateral limb is at high risk for ulcerations, infection, and Charcot neuroarthropathy. While most diabetic patients do well with a unilateral below knee amputation, the energy expenditure following a bilateral below knee amputation is great and many patients are unable to ambulate more than a few feet at a time. Admittedly, the number of diabetic bilateral amputees is small in relation to all diabetic patients; however, these patients are candidates for surgical reconstruction.
<P>Patient selection criteria are critical. All potential patients must have the cognitive ability to understand and comply with the postoperative course of care, which can run six to 12 months. The overall condition of the dorsal foot skin must be good. Occasionally, patients may be taking steroids or other medications that make the skin atrophic. Excessively dry and fissured skin should be dealt with prior to surgery. All open ulcerations must first be closed either with total contact casting or exostectomy. There should be no evidence of osteomyelitis. If there were previous ulcers, or if there is a question of osteomyelitis, laboratory and radiological testing should be performed. The medical condition of the patient must be optimized with good control of sugars and adequate nutritional status. Vascular assessment must be complete. Although the ankle/brachial index can indicate significant disease if it is reduced, it is often falsely elevated and therefore relatively unreliable in this group of patients. ABIs should be greater than 0.6. Toe pressures and waveforms will help assess distal circulation. Pressures greater than 40 mm Hg with phasic waveforms indicate adequate circulation. While these tests assess blood flow to the foot, TcPO2 measurements assess tissue oxygenation, which is a product of the oxygen carrying capacity of blood and rate of tissue diffusion. In our experience, a TcPO2 greater than 30 is adequate for most wound healing. 
<P>Finally, arrangements for adequate support systems must be made. Frequent office visits and prolonged immobilization make the road to recovery difficult. Anxiety and depression may occur during recovery and weightbearing ambulation may not be allowed for four to six months after surgery.  
<P>The goal of reconstruction surgery is to create a stable, plantigrade foot. This rarely involves in situ fusions but the surgeon is infrequently able to completely correct all deformity. The forefoot must be corrected to the hindfoot and the hindfoot must be made stable with relation to the leg. The foot must come to five degrees of dorsiflexion and weightbearing should be on the heel and ball of the foot. Since tissues are relatively inelastic due to nonenzymatic glycosylation of collagen, reductions of dislocated bones may not be possible and excision of bone fragments with shortening may be appropriate. Large quantities of proximal tibial or iliac crest bone graft is often necessary. Postoperatively, patients are placed in total contact casts until all swelling is reduced and radiographs show complete healing. Patients are then weaned to a special walker boot or a double upright calf-lacing brace and shoe for several months before ambulating in a shoe only. Lifelong bracing may be necessary in certain circumstances.
<P>Formal rehabilitation is often required when the patient begins to ambulate. This should include upper and lower extremity strengthening exercises and cardiac conditioning. Active range of motion exercises are encouraged. Caution is recommended with passive motion exercises since the foot is stiff and osteopenic and forceful manipulation can cause damage. 
<P>In our results of surgical reconstruction in more than 35 patients followed for an average of four years, the rate of fusion was high and the structural integrity of the foot remained stable with time. The complication rate was no higher than in similar surgeries performed in non-neuropathic patients. Interestingly, the level of pain diminished significantly after surgery, confirming the clinical observation that deep pain sensation may be intact, causing a lower but definite amount of discomfort.
<P>Surgical reconstruction is becoming a better defined procedure for the management of severe Charcot foot deformity. Limited surgical exostectomy is useful for the treatment of non-healing or recurrent plantar ulcerations in feet with stable deformity and an isolated bony prominence. Formal reconstruction is used in cases of severe deformity with recurrent ulceration, or midfoot or hindfoot instability where bracing is ineffective or contraindicated.
<P>Experienced surgical decision-making is necessary to assure consistently good results. The right decision for the right candidate can avert or defer a BK amputation.

<H1>Foot and Ankle Injuries in Competitive Senior Divers</H1>
<P><I>by Mark S. Mizel, MD; John V. Marymount, MD; J. Elliot Decker, MD; 
<BR>Elly Trepman, MD; &#38; Benjamin D. Rubin, MD</I> 
</CENTER>

<P>A specific sequence of movements is required to perform a dive in which normal function of the foot and ankle is crucial. Injury to either can render the diver unable to perform a specific part of the dive, limiting both dive selection and performance.
<P>Although the prevalence of foot and ankle injuries has been described in many sports, it has not been described for competitive diving. A review of the literature identifies only one case of a foot or ankle injury in a competitive diver. As such, we decided to survey senior registered competitive divers to evaluate the types of foot and ankle injuries, the manner in which they occur, and the time loss from the injury.
<P>Five hundred seventeen questionnaires were sent to senior competitive divers registered with the United States Diving Association. The diving regimen for this group consists of eight months of training per year with approximately 10 competitive events within a six-month period.
<P>The questionnaire requested information regarding the diver's injury, age, sex, dive type associated with injury, mechanism of injury, and outcome. Divers who reported injuries were contacted by telephone to obtain a more detailed description of the injury. When available, medical records and radiographs pertaining to the injury were reviewed.
<P>Dives are performed from a platform or springboard and can be grouped into forward, backward, reverse, inward, and twist dives. The starting position on the board is either facing front or back and the body rotates through the air in a forward or backward direction.
<P>While on the board, the diver goes through a series of movements called the take-off phase. This phase starts with the beginning of the springing motion and ends when the feet leave the take-off area. These movements vary depending upon the type of dive, but consist of the hurdle, press, and take-off. The hurdle is a jump from a one to a two foot take-off at the end of the board. The press is the depression of the springboard or, on the platform, the loading of the body weight onto the lower extremities prior to take-off. Take-off is the leaving of the diver's feet from the end of the board and before the diver begins the flight phase.
<P>The flight phase spans the time when the diver's body passes through the air. The body position during the flight phase can be identified as straight, pike, or tuck. The straight position is with the hips in neutral, knees in extension, and arms outstretched overhead. The pike position is with the hips flexed, knees extended, and arms outstretched or grasping the back of the knees. Tuck position is with the hips and knees fully flexed with the arms grasping across the front of the legs. The dive is completed when the diver enters the water.
<P>Of the 517 questionnaires sent to senior registered divers, 114 (22 percent) responded. Although the response rate may appear low, the experiences of these 114 divers still represent a broad collective of data that can be applied to the diving population at large. Of the 114 divers, 55 reported foot and ankle injuries. The average age of the 41 divers was 20.4 years (13 to 31 years of age) with an average diving career of 7.6 years (6 months to 21 years). Sixteen of the injured divers were men, 25 were women. Lateral ankle sprain and fractures were the most common injuries; of the fractures, metatarsal fractures were the most common.
<P>The injuries occurred in a variety of locations. Twenty-six occurred during springboard diving. Seven injuries occurred during dry land training and five occurred when the diver tested (checked) the board. Two injuries occurred on the platform. Fifteen injuries took place during actions not associated with a specific dive phase. These actions include overuse; double board bouncing; striking the pool deck, pool bottom, or pool gutter, and turning around on the board.
<P>Of the 26 springboard injuries, 17 occurred during the take-off phase, with the most during the press portion. The nine injuries during the flight phase were the result of accidental contact with the board. Of the five dive types, the reverse dive was most commonly associated with injury. The average time loss was 4.3 weeks (anywhere from 0 to 5 months) with the greatest time loss attributed to fractures. There was no long-term disability.
<P>The results of our survey indicate that the occurrence of foot and ankle injuries in competitive divers is greater than previously recognized, and lateral ankle sprains and fractures are the most common injuries. Although injuries appear more frequently with springboard diving, they also occur with platform diving. Most injuries occur during the press portion of the take-off phase, but injuries do occur in the flight phase when the diver's feet accidently hit the board. The reverse dive is most commonly associated with injury. Finally, the injuries sustained usually result in the loss of training time, but long-term disability is uncommon.

<H1>Prefab vs. Custom: The Longevity Issue</H1>
<P><I>by Douglas H. Richie, Jr., DPM 

</CENTER>


<P>In the debate over the value of prefabricated orthoses versus custom fabricated orthoses, the issue of longevity is commonly used as a differentiating factor. Orthotic laboratories and prescribing practitioners commonly state that one leading reason custom orthoses are worth more than prefabs is because they last longer. In fact, for this reason many custom orthotic labs position their prefab lines as "temporary" or "interim" devices.
<P>But is it true? Are custom orthoses really more durable and do they last longer than prefab devices? The answer, in my view, is an unequivocal "No." From a materials standpoint, there is no significant difference in the expected life span of an orthosis that is prefabricated versus one that is custom fabricated. 
<P>When comparing the value of custom orthoses to prefabricated orthoses, the prescribing practitioner should not raise durability as an issue, especially to patients. Instead, the difference, and presumably the value of custom vs. prefabricated orthotic devices, should be placed upon the correction and the processes of achieving such correction that is embodied in the custom device. 
<P>The accuracy and efficacy of custom device correction begins with the skill of the prescribing practitioner in the evaluation of the patient as well as the reliability of the three dimensional intermediary impression, whether taken by traditional casting or scanning procedure. Correction is implemented via prescription by the technician in the laboratory performing balancing and cast modification techniques. Technical advances in scanning and milling also aid in the accuracy of the correction. 
<P>Historically, the first prefabs were expanded foams that indeed compressed over time. They didn't last long, and hence earned their original reputation.
<P>But today, a survey of the prefab orthotic marketplace reveals an astonishingly wide array of devices differing in shape, dimension, and material composition. They are intended for all manner of treatments: functional, accommodative, or comfort. The applications intended cover everything from diabetic protection to dress. The point is, prefab orthoses--whether functional or accommodative--utilize the same materials seen in custom devices. Indeed, orthotic labs, such as KLM, will manufacture any prefab orthosis utilizing any of the materials available in its custom line, including TL-2100, polypropylene, subortholen, and Polydor. Accommodative custom orthoses commonly employ laminants of Plastazote, Poron, and cork, all available in prefabricated orthoses through various manufacturers. 
<P>So if practitioners today can implement custom or prefabricated orthotic therapy using their material of choice--whether for prefab or custom devices--why does the marketing of custom orthoses lead one to believe that customs are more durable? The classic example is the custom orthotic lab that offers a Lifetime Guarantee for the durability of its orthotic devices. Admittedly, that refers to structural integrity, such as shell breakage, not suitability. Nonetheless, the message practitioner and patient receive is that this device will continue to function and provide therapeutic benefit over the patient's entire lifetime. 
<P>A lifetime guarantee indeed. How can a device prescribed to a 20-year-old aerobic dancer be appropriate for activity, lifestyle, and shoe type when she is 65 years old? Will a device fitted to a patient with tibialis posterior dysfunction with an acquired flatfoot deformity still conform to the foot of the patient five years later? Should patients be assured that their prescription will be appropriate indefinitely and treatment will not have to be updated periodically? 
<P>What about "lifetime performance" of materials? Polyolefin plastics such as polypropylene and polyethylene can be expected to undergo plastic deformation under loads normally applied to the human foot during gait. Thus, these devices can be expected to lose shape conformity to the foot. Orthoses composed of foam materials or containing foam top covers and extensions will predictably deteriorate over time with compression set (i.e., Plastazote) or abrasion-induced erosion (i.e., Poron). Likewise, composite orthoses can undergo creep deformation or can develop cracks leading to complete breakage. Does using an intermediary three dimensional impression, which makes them custom, somehow make these materials more durable following fabrication and modification?
<P>Custom orthotic devices reflect time, skill, and technology not seen in the prefabricated devices. That has an economic value. But whether fit, comfort, and therapeutic efficacy are enhanced by these processes is open to debate. What should not be debated is whether custom orthoses are more durable than prefabs. Both devices have a limited life span that mandates ongoing monitoring of orthotic patients with replacement and/or upgrading of orthoses on a regular basis.

<H1>Pediatric Gait: An Overview</H1>
<P><I>by Russell G. Volpe, DPM
</CENTER>

<P>The typical practitioner is more comfortable observing the gait of adults than that of children. After all, a reference model for "normal" gait exists for the adult, enabling easy comparison of any patient to that standard. Practitioner discomfort associated with watching children walk and trying to make meaningful assessments stems from difficulties identifying what is normal and at what age. The development of mature, adult-like gait in a growing child is an ongoing process tied closely to maturation of the nervous system and growth of the lower extremity. The practitioner needs to be familiar with the intricacies of this ongoing process to identify the child with variations in gait that, at particular ages, may be associated with pathology. Furthermore, the child is not a "mini-adult" and it is important to know the many differences in normal gait between these two groups.
<P>Pediatric patients with lower extremity concerns may be classified into two groups. The infant, under one year of age, does not bear weight. Consequently, most of the problems seen are congenital in nature. The toddler, beginning at one year of age, has started to walk. The family is now concerned about how the child walks. Anxieties run high about "normal" gait as the journey to mature, adult ambulation begins. Parents see a wide-base, significant bow, and noticeable out-toe. They are often concerned that these are abnormalities that may impair the child's growth, development, and normal function. These anxieties are found more frequently in first-time parents because they have never observed a child go through the gait maturation process.
<P>The average age of onset for walking is within three months of a child's first birthday. At this age children have a high stance to swing ratio. This minimizes the amount of time spent in the less stable condition of single limb stance. With central nervous system maturation just beginning, a child would have difficulty with a single limb stance duration as long as that found in a mature adult. The maturation of the central nervous system proceeds in a head-to-toe direction. Thus, children have greater control and stability in the proximal portion of the lower extremity before that of the distal extremity, including the foot. 
<P>A child's gait develops over the first few years of walking to a mature, adult-like model by about age seven. Practitioners evaluating the walking of children should be familiar with this maturation process and the ages when changes may be expected to occur. The early walker has a wide-base of gait, helpful in assisting the child with balance and stability as he or she takes the first tentative steps. There is absence of reciprocal arm swing with the arm held abducted and flexed, also to aid in early balance and stability. The stride length of an early walker is short--a consequence of the child's height and immaturity of the neuromuscular control mechanisms useful in increasing step length. The one-year old walks at a low velocity with a high cadence to help adjust for the reduced stride length, dictated by short leg length.
<P>The shortened swing phase, or off weightbearing period, is accompanied by increased flexion of the hip and knee to help the child with ground clearance of the plantarflexed foot as it passes by the other limb. This plantarflexed position of the ankle in late swing is responsible for the absence of a heel-strike, with a foot-flat contact typical of this age group as the stance phase begins. The hip is externally rotated in swing, contributing to the out-toed, waddling appearance of the typical early walker.
<P>In stance phase, the knee and hip remain more flexed than in the older child and they lack the full extension associated with a more mature gait.
<P>As the child grows, we see that a narrowing of the base of gait has fallen from 70 percent of pelvic width at one year to 45 percent of pelvic width by age three and a half. Reciprocal arm swing has emerged by age two to three with a reduction in the narrowing of the base of gait that occurs as the child's neuromuscular system matures, leading to greater balance and stability.
<P>With greater height, the stride length increases. There is a dramatic increase in stride length through age four--a period of rapid growth. Stride length continues to increase until age seven, albeit at a slower rate, at which time it resembles adult averages.
<P>Speed of walking, or velocity, increases in toddlers through age seven. Simultaneously, there is a decrease in the cadence--a consequence of longer stride length and decreasing velocity.
<P>The swing/stance ratio shifts towards an adult ratio of 40/60 by age four. The child develops a heel strike by age two, enabling the adult contact position of a neutral ankle able to rapidly planterflex after contact. At the age of two the child demonstrates increased knee flexion after contact to facilitate the ongoing need for shock absorption in gait.
<P>In swing, the hyperflexion of the hip and knee found to aid in ground clearance in the presence of a more plantarflexed ankle decreases. The knee approaches full extension in stance as the child ages, reaching adult levels by age seven. The angle of gait reduces, with decreased external hip rotation, leading to a mature angle of gait of approximately 10 degrees abducted.
<P>Armed with an understanding of the developmental process leading from a toddler's first tentative steps through the adult-like gait of the mature child, the practitioner is ready to employ gait analysis in pediatric diagnostics. A firm foundation in the normal gait characteristics of children at various ages enables practitioners to identify a deviation from the norm. Recognition of those deviations, coupled with a sound musculoskeletal and neurologic assessment, will improve a practitioner's diagnostic acumen.

<H2>Sammarco succeeds Baxter</H2>
James Sammarco, MD, succeeds Donald Baxter, MD, as president of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society at the society's annual meeting to be held June 29 at Hilton Head, South Carolina. Dr. Sammarco is one of America's leading experts on diabetes and the lower extremity, as well as dance medicine. Dr. Baxter is an authority on sports medicine and is a trainer with the Olympic Games being held this year in Atlanta. Both men are extremely popular not only within orthopedics, but throughout the various disciplines of the biomechanics mainstream. 
<P>The entertainment highlight of the AOFAS meeting will be an Olympic Beach Bonanza sponsored by <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> in association with Johnson &#38; Johnson and other key vendors. Both Drs. Sammarco and Baxter are members of the <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> Board of Advisors and both have articles in this issue. 

<H2>Gallagher a hit</H2>
Sean Gallagher, PT, has made it to Broadway in more ways than one. Dr. Gallagher has for years been one of Broadway's most experienced dance therapists behind the scenes, after he stopped dancing himself. But last month Dr. Gallagher grabbed center stage, and a lot of laughs. In a modern dance piece called "Pass the Oil Please," performed as part of the Parsons Dance Company production at New York's Joyce Theater, Dr. Gallagher and Gina Giammanco pummeled their way into audience's hearts. 
<P>The act, said Dr. Gallagher, is simply an exaggeration of what physical therapists normally do, set to music. Choreographer David Parsons came up with the idea as Gallagher worked him over on a table. "He said, 'You know, I think an audience could feel this,'" Dr. Gallagher recalls. "And that's how it all got started." 
<P>Dr. Gallagher, a member of the <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> Board of Advisors, said he wasn't sure if what they were doing would be funny or not. "We stretched them (two Parsons dancers), yanked them, cranked them, flipped them, and flopped them," he said--with a little break for a tango in between. "The audience was usually in hysterics," said Gallagher, who was a dancer for 10 years. "It was a lot of fun." Don't look for Gallagher to go back to a dancing career. Said Dr. Gallagher, "It's not like it's my comeback or anything." But there is a chance "Pass the Oil" could go on the road. 

<H2>Good gait</H2>
Novel is sponsoring its 5th emed Scientific Meeting at the Center for Locomotion Studies at Pennsylvania State University August 18-20. It is the second time the high-tech German plantar pressure measurement company has held its event in the United States. Workshops, presentations, and discussion groups are planned. Novel solicits papers on plantar pressure and will bestow the Novel Award on the winning paper. The award includes a $10,000 prize, up from 10,000 DM, in honor of the event being held in America.

<H2>APMA News reaches out</H2>
The <CITE>APMA News</CITE>, published by the American Podiatric Medical Association, successfully changed format to a slicker standard magazine size earlier this year, but it hasn't forgotten its mandate to reach out to as many in the podiatric community as possible. That reach includes thousands of retirees and podiatric students. In doing so, the <CITE>APMA News</CITE> has shown considerable communal commitment since most commercial advertisers will not advertise in a publication that devotes a substantial amount of its circulation to non-practicing readers. Most independent professional publications delete readers after retirement. Nonetheless, the APMA has been able to defray costs by selling advertisements for podiatric meetings and through institutional advertising from Dr. Scholls and insurance companies. The APMA recently conducted a survey and discovered that it is rated number one among retirees no longer in practice.

<H1>Managing Achilles Tendon Disorders in the Athlete: <BR>from Stretching to Surgery</H1>
<P><I>by Steven L. Haddad, MD &#38; <A HREF="mailto:mark4feet@aol.com">Mark S. Myerson, MD</A></I> 
</CENTER>

<P>Eli, a medical journalist, had nudged past 40 and hadn't played basketball for several years when he accepted a challenge from a much younger colleague. Without warming up, Eli hit the court running. Fifteen minutes into the ballgame, Eli went down, grabbing the back of his leg in pain and yelling, "Who hit me?" Eli hobbled off the court, insisting someone had smacked his leg with a club. The next day, a doctor told him the unhappy truth. The hammering sensation was typical for an Achilles injury. 
<P>Eli's partial tear was treated with casting, and for weeks after cast removal he moved around on crutches. Scarring set in. Today, the healed ankle constantly causes him pain. Massage and heat therapy provide only temporary relief. Years after the incident, Eli regrets not managing his Achilles injury better. But Eli, who had access to some of the best doctors in his area, is typical of "sometimes" athletes who refuse to face the facts about their age, their need to warm up, and the ramifications of an Achilles injury.
<P>Understanding the crucial role the Achilles plays in sports injuries is essential if practitioners are to counsel patients such as Eli. In the athlete, the Achilles tendon is subject to tremendous forces, ranging from two to three times body weight in walking to four to six times body weight in running and jumping. It is responsible for the quick start of a sprinter, the leap of a basketball center, and the releve of a ballet dancer. Unlike other tendons, there is no true synovial tendon sheath, only a peritenon or fibrous tissue. In addition, there is a relative area of avascularity from approximately 2 to 6 cm proximal to the insertion on the calcaneus. This avascularity, coupled with the tremendous force, makes this region of the tendon most susceptible to pathologic conditions.
<P>Many diseases affect the Achilles tendon in athletes. Most may be attributed to "overuse," or accumulative repetitive use of the tendon. The bony alignment of the foot (particularly increased pronation) or the type of footwear worn also may increase stresses across the tendon and cause injury. In runners, damage to the tendon has ranged from 2.7 through 20.3 percent of the running population; dancers have about a 4 percent incidence of Achilles disorders; in football a low 0.8 percent incidence of Achilles problems is reported. The vast majority of severe injury to the tendon, particularly rupture, occurs in older athletes with poor exercise habits.
<P>The various tendon and tendon-related disorders that affect athletes, with current management strategies, are listed below.

<H2>Insertional Achilles Bursitis and Tendinitis</H2>
Insertional bursitis or tendinitis implies that the pathology is near the insertion of the Achilles into the calcaneus. Athletes with pain in this region often have an associated Haglund's deformity--a prominence of the posterior calcaneal tuberosity proximal to the Achilles insertion. This prominence irritates the bursa located in the retrocalcaneal space anterior to the tendon. Following repetitive irritation during running, a painful inflammatory bursitis occurs. Poor shoe selection with a tight heel counter may cause increased compression within this region, accentuating the inflammation (giving rise to the term "pump-bump"). This inflammation may spread to the adjacent Achilles tendon, creating insertional tendinitis. The insertion is distal to the bony prominence, causing significant posterior heel pain with more advanced inflammation.
<P>Patients with bursitis present with tenderness in the retrocalcaneal space, anterior to the Achilles tendon. Pain from the Haglund's deformity is located more posterolaterally over the bone itself. If the condition has spread to include tendinitis, the tendon may become tender and crepitance may be noted with dorsiflexion and plantarflexion.
<P>Management is initially conservative. Stretching exercises are performed by placing outstretched hands against a wall, extending the affected leg, and leaning forward until the tendon becomes taught. The foot and leg must be in a neutral position or slightly internally rotated to ensure that the Achilles tendon is isolated. This position is then held for 10 seconds. Bouncing should be avoided. Three sets of 10 stretches should be performed twice daily. Intermittent icing of the tendon and anti-inflammatory medicine help quell inflammation. Shoe modification with appropriate heel wedges may be helpful. A 1/4-inch heel lift can alleviate stress on the tendon--especially in an individual with a cavus foot--since this shifts the bone prominence away from the tendon. A u-shaped pad can be placed surrounding the bump to alleviate pressure. Since the risk of tendon rupture with local steroid use is well documented, steroid injections definitely should be avoided. Occasionally, a short leg cast may be required to rest the bursa and tendon and allow inflammation to subside. However, prolonged casting is discouraged since it may encourage weakness of the tendon and calf atrophy.
<P>Surgical management may become necessary for refractory cases (after four to six months of conservative care). We prefer a lateral longitudinal approach over the calcaneus anterior to the tendon. If the bone prominence is large, a medial and lateral incision will provide sufficient and improved visualization of the bone deformity. This prominence is then removed with a chisel, and radiographs are taken to confirm that sufficient bone has been removed. The insertion of the tendon is distal to the prominence and therefore is not compromised with this approach. 
<P>If calcifications are present within the Achilles tendon, they may be removed easily by shelling them out. If a portion of the insertion is removed in the course of this debridement, the tendon may be secured to bone with suture-anchors. Post-operatively, the foot and ankle should be immobilized from two to eight weeks according to swelling and any potential compromise to the tendon. The patient can remove the boot in a recumbent position and work on range-of-motion exercises. Strengthening and stretching exercises should begin around the six week mark. Patients generally return to normal activities within three to six months, but those who require debridement of the tendon insertion for calcific tendinitis may take considerably longer to recover.

<H2>Achilles Peritendinitis and Tendinitis</H2>
Non-insertional tendinitis and peritendinitis occurs in the region 2 to 6 cm proximal to the Achilles insertion. This corresponds to the relatively avascular region confirmed by microvascular studies. Peritendinitis is defined as inflammation of the peritendon. The pain remains more localized in peritendinitis and is often associated with decreased range of motion. In certain cases, a nodular appearance to the distal tendon is apparent. These nodules are seen in more chronic cases, where mucoid degeneration occurs with fissuring of the tendon.
<P>Patients with peritendinitis are generally younger, more active, and have sustained a classic overuse injury. The condition can be seen in an ice skater who performs too many jumps before appropriate leg strength conditioning has taken place. Peritendinitis is the most common Achilles pathology in runners and is seen in athletes who push too many miles for their conditioning level. Poor shoewear and improper foot mechanics can accentuate or even create the condition.
<P>Conservative management is similar to that prescribed for insertional tendinitis: rest, but not necessarily immobilization. Rather, a decrease in the duration, intensity, and frequency of training is generally sufficient. Ice-water whirlpool baths and ultrasound also are helpful, and modification of shoewear to correct structural gait problems is encouraged. Appropriate stretching prior to workouts and in the morning and evening is mandatory. If all else fails, immobilization in a walker-boot provides true rest for the tendon and allows physical therapy and stretching exercises to be performed. Cast immobilization--while resting the tendon--prevents concurrent physical therapy. Generally, most patients with peritendinitis do well with conservative measures.

<H2>Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture</H2>
Acute Achilles tendon ruptures are found in a generally older population than those individuals who sustain tendinitis. Generally, ruptures are found in patients with degenerative disease already present in the tendon. Unlike patients with tendinitis, however, these degenerative changes usually are asymptomatic. Patients are the proverbial "weekend warriors."  Basketball or jumping sports are common offenders, with patients landing on a rigidly plantarflexed foot and feeling like an opponent kicked them in the back of the heel or leg. At 8 percent strain, the tendon fails and breaks the collagen cross-links.
<P>Pain is not the initial symptom. The individual first complains of being unable to run. Although the diagnosis may appear to be obvious, one study revealed that 20 to 25 percent of ruptures are initially missed. Careful palpation may reveal the defect in the relative avascular zone 2 to 6 cm proximal to the insertion. The patient also should be examined prone and the Thompson Squeeze Test should be performed on the calf. Passive plantarflexion of the foot is noted if the tendon is intact.
<P>Nonoperative management--which has its proponents--consists of cast immobilization in equinus from 8 to 12 weeks. This provides an environment for tendon healing through hematoma to collagen proliferation and maturation. The cast is changed every month with progressive dorsiflexion at each cast change. After removing the cast, the patient uses a heel lift for an additional four to eight weeks while the tendon continues to heel. During this time period, a hinged ankle-foot orthosis blocked at neutral may be used as a supplement.
<P>Many studies, however, have conclusively shown that functional differences are present between operative and non-operative patients. In recent years, some practitioners have begun to mobilize their rupture patients soon after surgery. In our professional experience, we have found that patients treated by casting alone show a significant decrease in strength, power, and endurance versus those we have treated surgically. In our view, longterm usage has its drawbacks, including muscle atrophy, articular cartilage weakening and degeneration, skin necrosis, deep vein thrombosis, and joint stiffness. Other studies have demonstrated a higher incidence of tendon rerupture following closed Achilles tendon treatment. Therefore, in our opinion, closed treatment should be reserved for individuals not interested in functional performance and high levels of activity. Athletes deserve open surgical repair of their acute tendon rupture.
<P>Our results of operative treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures in athletes were excellent. A majority of our patients were treated under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis. We emphasized a functional rehabilitation with early range of motion and early weightbearing to maximize early return to athletic activity. Between 48 and 72 hours after surgery, the patient is placed in a removable posterior splint and an early range of motion program is initiated. The patient is instructed to move the ankle passively four to five times each day as comfort allows through 10 to 20 degrees of both plantarflexion and dorsiflexion. The splint is worn when passive exercises are not being performed. At 10 to 14 days after surgery, the sutures are removed and early weightbearing begins. Patients are fitted for a walking boot that permits full plantarflexion but allows dorsiflexion to 10 degrees. Four weeks after surgery, half the patients moved to a boot with an elevated heel. Physical therapy is an essential part of the rehabilitative process.
<P>Ninety-three percent of patients had a full return to their sport by six months. From a functional standpoint, 90 percent had a full range of motion six weeks after surgery, and 87 percent were able to perform a single-limb toe raise within three months of surgery. By six months, the functional deficit as tested by a Cybex dynamometer demonstrated a 2.3 percent deficit in the involved leg versus the normal extremity.
<P>With any type of treatment for Achilles tendon rupture--whether it be operative or nonoperative modalities--cast immobilization never allows full rehabilitation of the extremity. A 10 to 30 percent deficit in power, endurance, or strength will occur sometime after cast removal regardless of the protocol used. Several studies have since demonstrated that mobilization is optimal for connective tissue healing; therefore, our goal was to develop a stable suture technique for tendon repair that would not need cast supplementation. In our experience, for the athlete whose return to pre-injury functional status is mandatory, our repair technique--coupled with a post-operative protocol of early mobilization and strengthening--best achieves this goal.

<H2>Chronic Achilles Tendon Rupture</H2>
Unfortunately, many acute Achilles tendon ruptures are missed at initial presentation because some patients initially do not believe they have sustained a severe injury. They have enough pushoff power from their remaining flexors to believe they have merely incurred a severe strain. Later, a physical examination will demonstrate significant calf atrophy and an inability to perform a single heel rise test on the affected extremity. If the patient is able to rise on the affected extremity, they will fatigue earlier than on the normal leg.
<P>Generally, the tendon heals or scars into an elongated or lengthened position, decreasing strength and compromising motion. This is a significant problem in the athlete, where equivalent functional status in each extremity is tantamount to optimal performance. Thus, reconstructive procedures should be considered in the individual searching for this level of performance. Such procedures are difficult to perform and should only be attempted by individuals with an in-depth understanding of the biomechanics of the lower extremity. Alternative reconstruction efforts are directed at augmenting the dysfunctional Achilles tendon, if necessary, with an adjacent muscle tendon unit such as the peroneous longus, flexor hallucis or flexor digitorum longus tendons. Unfortunately, no other tendon can match the strength of the Achilles. Thus, reconstructive procedures must restore the continuity of the Achilles tendon at its nascent length in addition to augmentation. Accurate tensioning of this reconstruction is critical. 
<P>Rehabilitation following such surgery obviously is more complex than that after acute tendon rupture. The ankle generally is kept in some equinus for up to one month, with range-of-motion exercises beginning after that time period. By two months post-op, the patient is weightbearing in a walker boot with the ankle in neutral. A strengthening program is also started at two months. If healing appears to be appropriate, the patient may resume activities by four months, but running is generally not permitted for six months. 
<P>Achilles tendon injuries in the athlete are challenging problems for physicians to manage. Whether it be insertional tendinitis, peritindinitis, tendinitis, or acute or chronic rupture of the tendon, diagnostic skills and attention to detail are mandatory for optimal outcome. Returning the athlete to pre-injury status should be the primary goal in all instances. Although 70 to 90 percent of athletes have such successful comebacks after surgery, three to five percent of the athletes must abandon their sport due to their debilitation. The biomechanics mainstream must educate athletes  on how to comply with the strategies described in this article, even though it may involve refraining from the sport for a period of time.

<H2>Going for the Gold--and the Silver</H2>
</CENTER>
As the world thinks Olympic and as summer athletes of all stripes think they are infallible, every practitioner will be confronting sports and recreation-related biomechanical issues. Our cover story by orthopedic surgeons Mark Myerson, MD, and Steven L. Haddad, MD, address management of the Achilles tendon in the athlete, from stretching to surgery. Their approach recommends earlier mobilization and is sure to provoke comment. Then Jeffrey P. Broker, PhD, with the U.S. Olympic Committee delves into cycling overuse injuries. Dr. Broker's article is a must-read for anyone treating the cycling population. Plus, noted dance physical therapist Sean Gallagher, PT, offers his personal assessment of ankle stirrup braces, from the old line Aircast to newcomers such as the Johnson &#38; Johnson AS3.
<P>Then we offer two surveys. First, a formal one on foot orthosis material preferences by two investigators from the U.S. Public Health's Gillis Long Hansen's Disease Center. Jim Foto, C.Ped and Jim Birke, PhD, mailed more than 3,700 surveys to a spectrum of practitioners to determine which materials they preferred. <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> is publishing the results of their survey first. Then, we conducted our own informal mini-survey on the use of prefabricated orthosis. The first 50 responses received were tabulated and combined with our own knowledge of the field to provide interesting insights into who's using what. Guess which material was voted number one in both surveys?
<P>Now some updates on our cross-specialty work. It has been a very active summer. First, we completed initial construction of the Physical Therapy Home Page, which was unveiled in mid-June at the American Physical Therapy Association annual meeting in Minneapolis. Physical therapists who sign onto <A HREF="http://www.biomech.com/PhysicalTherapy">www.biomech.com/PhysicalTherapy</A> will find a customized version of the BioMechanics Gateway, which offers abundant links to the world of PT research and APTA websites. The Physical Therapy Home Page is the prototype of our dozen or so specialty home pages. Simultaneously, we briefed athletic trainers at the National Athletic Trainers Association annual convention in Orlando on the coming Athletic Trainers Home Page. 
<P>Also in June, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society honored <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> for its article, <CITE>The Comfort Revolution</CITE>. The AOFAS annual meeting was held at Hilton Head. Its Olympic Bonanza Beach Party was cosponsored by BioMechanics, Johnson &#38; Johnson, Soft Spots, and others. 
<P>Just before this issue mailed, we mailed the first of six specialty-specific reports. The first was on orthoses and biomechanics and circulated to the chiropractic community. The report was a collection of articles previously published in <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>, authored by noted orthopedists, podiatrists, physiatrists, and physical therapists. 
<P>Two special reports also will be published for podiatry (on managed and also future practice), two for O&#38;P (on the paralympics and future practice), and one for physiatry (on bracing). These five additional publications will mail at various points in the summer and fall.
<P>At the same time, the third issue of <CITE>Stride</CITE> is just about ready to release. We are proud of Stride and the hundreds of thousands of consumers we are reaching with our message of biomechanical health through doctor's offices, shoe stores, and health and fashion centers everywhere.
<P>As you can see it's a summer of going for the gold for our small staff. But now a personal note about going for the silver. As I write this, it's 3:00 pm June 28. In a few minutes I'll be fitted for a tux and will dash from the office to celebrate my 25th wedding anniversary with Elizabeth, art director of this magazine, coeditor of <CITE>Stride</CITE>, and partner for life. I share this moment with you because so many of you have been part of our lives for the past nine years. You have made an impact on our lives. We hope we have done the same for you.

<H1>Knee Pain in Cycling: A New Twist on an Old Injury</H1>
<P><I>by Jeffrey P. Broker, PhD</I> 
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>A biomechanical look at knee injury patterns in cycling holds answers to treating knee pain.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>

<HR>
<P>"It's my knee, Doc! I can't push the big gear or do the long ride anymore." These sad words from a disheartened bicycle racer should sound familiar to any clinician who regularly treats cyclists. Worse yet, cycling knee injuries seem to be on the rise. What is it about pedaling action that puts excessive stress on the knee joint? A closer look at knee injury patterns in cycling and potential pathomechanicals of pedaling is warranted.
<P>The lower extremity in cycling is smoothly guided during each pedal stroke through a limited and well defined range of motion. Forces generated within the skeleton during pedaling also fluctuate in a steady, predictable, and nonviolent manner. Consequently, it is no wonder cyclists generally enjoy a freedom from such injuries as ligament sprains (caused by excessive joint motions), cartilage tears (resulting from excessive skeletal loading in conjunction with specific motions), and fatigue fractures (a repetitive impact phenomenon). Instead, the bane of the cyclist is more often the non-traumatic overuse injury--that affliction caused by repetitive and excessive loading of specific tissues.
<P>The knee tops the list as the site where the greatest number of cycling-related overuse injuries occur. Higher intensity training methods, changes in bicycle/rider setup geometry (notably steeper seat tube angles), and the widespread use of clipless pedals are factors believed to be associated with an increase in the number and frequency of overuse knee injuries in recent years. A closer look at the knee injury picture indicates anterior knee injuries are most common among cyclists (patellar pain and patellar tendinitis leading the pack), followed by medial injuries (medial plica, retinacular thickening), and then lateral injuries (iliotibial band syndrome in particular).
<P>Which cyclists sustain overuse knee injuries? Cyclists of every ability level are at risk. High-level competitive cyclists (category I and II, for example) train intensely to remain at their competitive best. A large percentage of knee injuries in this population result from training errors such as too many miles, too many hills, and use of too-large gears (or too-low a pedaling rate) early in the season.
<P>Another causative factor among competitive cyclists suffering with knee pain are errors in bicycle adjustments. In my opinion, these adjustment errors, including maladjusted cleats and/or improperly placed saddles, generate misalignments in the lower extremity during the pedal stroke. Misalignments, although often subtle and difficult to see by visual inspection, can generate abnormally high cyclical loads in specific tissues. These loads become pathological at the intensity levels and training volumes at which these cyclists operate.
<P>Touring cyclists, whose participation in the sport often involves occasional rides of significant length each year, often develop a knee overuse injury assignable to one specific ride. Patellar pain is the most frequent clinical finding in these cyclists, followed by iliotibial band syndrome. These sporadic high mileage riders sometimes can be classified as poor trainers, because they often do not train adequately for their touring rides. Bicycle maladjustments also are frequent in this group.
<P>Recreational riders and individuals using bicycles and stationary trainers for aerobic exercise seek out orthopaedic treatment less frequently for their cycling-specific overuse knee injuries, so data concerning the nature and cause of these injuries are limited. It can be assumed, however, that knee injuries develop in these cyclists as mileage levels and/or training intensities rise, particularly if maladjustments in bicycle setup are present. 
<P>The cycling overuse knee injury phenomenon has not gone unnoticed by biomechanists. Early motion studies revealed that many cyclists reporting to clinics with knee problems exhibited nonlinear knee trajectories during pedaling. Imagine the trajectory the knee cap or tibial tuberosity follows in space as viewed from the front of the bicycle. In problematic cyclists, the trajectories of these knee landmarks often deviate significantly toward the top tube, or centerline of the bicycle during the downstroke. Some cyclists even brush their knees against the bicycle top tube during pedalling. As a result of these observations, a general relationship between internal rotation of the tibia (counterclockwise rotation of the right leg when viewed from above), knee valgus (a knocked kneed position), and knee injuries was proposed. Several clinicians and researchers began experimenting with orthoses and pedal cant in an attempt to elicit more linear knee motion in problematic cyclists. These efforts have been successful in managing knee pain in some cyclists.
<P>In search of a more complete understanding of how some knee pain develops, biomechanists turned to the instrumented bicycle pedal for answers. One concept that surfaced was a potential relationship between knee pain and pedal torsion. The ramifications regarding bicycle setup and shoe/pedal system selection are potentially significant.
<P>Torsional forces are present at the shoe/pedal interface during pedaling. The torsional force (or torque) arises as the foot in the shoe attempts to rotate or "twist" about an axis perpendicular to the pedal surface. Pedal torsion typically peaks midway through the power phase of the pedal cycle (downstroke), and is described to be internally directed. In other words, the foot attempts to rotate inward relative to the pedal (heel attempts to move out). During recovery (upstroke), torsion is externally directed, but lower in magnitude than the internally directed torsion seen during the power stroke.
<P>The effect of this torque acting at the shoe/pedal interface on knee loading may be critical. The torque applied by the lower extremity to the pedal about an axis perpendicular to the pedal surface is, in a sense, transmitted to the knee joint. Since this torque at the shoe/pedal interface is known to be affected (and probably reduced) by the allowance for "float" within the pedal system, it is reasonable to suggest that the introduction of float into the pedal system may reduce the magnitude of the torque at the knee, and perhaps the frequency of overuse injuries.
<P>In a study conducted at UCLA in the early 1990s, pedal interface type was found to affect the magnitude of pedal torsion. Specifically, floating clipless pedals reduced the power phase (downstroke) torsion relative to fixed clipless and toe-clip designs. The attenuation decreased both the internal and external peak torque.
<P>Perhaps even more dramatic, experienced cyclists clinically diagnosed with overuse knee injuries in the UCLA study exhibited distinctly different pedal torsion patterns. Specifically, chronic anterior knee pain subjects demonstrated exaggerated internally directed peak torques during the power phase, increased rates of torsional load generation, and a longer duration of the applied internal torque. These results strongly suggest a link between pedal torsion and knee pain in cyclists. These results also offer support to the numerous subjective claims from cyclists that switching from fixed to floating pedals is an effective cure for pedaling knee pain.
<P>Finally, revisiting the proposal that tibial rotation plays a role in knee pathology, a recent study conducted with U.S. National Team cyclists at the Olympic Training Center revealed that tibial rotation in elite cyclists appears to have a very weak correlation with torsion measured at the pedal. It appears that pronation and supination at the subtalar joint, which couple rotations of the tibia to motion within the foot, may be complicating our interpretation of lower limb action and pedal torsional loading. A detailed investigation of skeletal motion in the lower limb in conjunction with pedal force and torque measurements will be required to more fully understand this phenomenon.
<P>The overuse knee injury problem in cycling will certainly not go away. Biomechanical research concerning the mechanics and pathomechanics of pedaling will continue to enhance our ability to treat and manage cyclists presenting with knee pain. It remains the challenge of the experienced clinician with a specialized knowledge of cycling to weigh the various factors including training history, musculoskeletal symmetry, alignment, functional status, rider/bicycle configuration, and pedaling technique in an attempt to keep riders riding longer, faster, and pain free.

<H1>Which Ankle Brace is Right for Your Patient?</H1>
<P><I>by Sean P. Gallagher, PT</I> 
</CENTER>

<P>Ankle braces come in many shapes and configurations depending on the specific type of support and movement restrictions they are designed to provide. The most common support is lateral ankle stability followed by medial ankle stability (inversion and eversion respectively) and lastly subtalar support (heel lock). When selecting a brace for a patient, practitioners must go beyond simply fitting the patient according to type and severity. The patient's needs must be considered as well. Compliance is the key to any bracing therapy. Is the brace comfortable? Will it fit easily into the patient's shoes? How does the patient put it on and remove it? 
<P>Most ankle braces are either stirrup or full ankle support with stirrup variations. Stirrup braces are used primarily for inversion or eversion injuries while full ankle support braces are used for talocrural and subtalar injuries or both. Since many ankle injuries include both types of injuries, hybrid variations are often used. Stirrup braces are the easiest to put on while full ankle brace hybrids require more time. 
<P>Most stirrup braces are made of a hard plastic stirrup with cushioning material on the inside surface and are secured on the outside with straps and/or Velcro. Plastic stirrup supports are not all the same. Some have hinges at the ankle joint; others do not. The real difference between these braces is the type of cushioning material found on the inside of the stirrup. Some employ a gel that can be frozen, thus providing molded cold compression and facilitated vascular pumping with ankle support. Other materials rely upon neoprene or air cushioning to provide compression and pumping support. Full ankle support braces that lace up take the most time to apply and remove, which is a major consideration. 
<P>I personally evaluated a limited number of ankle braces for their orthopedic and physical therapy value. The braces tested were comfortable and could be worn inside my sneaker with little trouble. Your results may vary.
<CENTER>
<H2>STIRRUP BRACES</H2>
</CENTER>
<B>Darco DarcoGel.</B> DarcoGel provided good medial and lateral support while applying pressure and cold to the ankle area with its unique gel pack inserts. This model also could be used for prophylactic and chronic problems since even after the gel warmed up it still provided added support and compression. My brace often slipped in the shoe because of the small piece of fabric used as a heel support. Regular adjustments are bearable, however, since during the acute stage of an injury the patient will be icing often. As the patient becomes more active, this constant adjustment becomes a nuisance. Straps used for holding the stirrups are made of Velcro and tended to irritate the skin.

<P><B>Active Ankle.</B> The Active was designed by an athletic trainer to incorporate special features focussing on comfort. The stirrups have a hinge at the malleoli level with the lateral side lower than the medial to more closely resemble functional anatomy. The inside padding comes in two types: one made of neoprene that is used for " Training," and the "Bubble Flex Cushioning System," which provides enhanced compression for acute injuries. These inserts are interchangeable and can be adjusted to fit almost any anatomical variation. The brace's heel footplate support is made of plastic and is part of the stirrup mechanism. The Active Ankle brace avoids much of the slipping found in other braces. The straps used to hold the stirrups are made of a wide soft fabric with Velcro attached only to their ends, thus avoiding skin discomfort. These were the best straps of all the braces evaluated. The brace's hinged design also provided excellent inversion and eversion support while allowing plantarflexion and dorsiflexion. The Active Ankle brace is best suited for prophylactic use, but is still an excellent brace for acute inversion and eversion sprains. It also was the most comfortable brace tried. The Active is ordered by shoe size.

<P><B>Joint Solutions Sure Step.</B> The Sure Step stirrup brace is similar in many ways to the Active. The Sure Step has hinges, but they are not offset to adapt to the anatomical configuration of the ankle. The hinges can be locked to provide more stability than casting in grade three sprains. The manufacturer states, "The unique modified orthotic footplate helps maintain arch support and the subtalar joint in a neutral position." This may be true for many patients, but putting a rigid orthosis into a shoe for an ankle sprain for all types of feet may also cause other foot problems. This brace should only be used after a biomechanical evaluation of the foot is done to ensure that the orthotic support of the brace is beneficial to the patient's particular anatomical configuration of the foot. The padding is also neoprene and can be adjusted for anatomical variations. The straps used to secure the stirrups are made of narrow Velcro material which can irritate to the skin.

<P><B>Aircast Air-Stirrup.</B> Aircast's stirrups are, of course, the original item. Its models have molded sides to approximate the ankle as long as they are fitted properly. The inner stirrup support system is an adjustable air-cell mechanism with two compartments that allow for graduated compression from inferior to superior and prevent slipping of the air cushion from around the malleoli. Both air cells are also lined with a compressible foam. The adjustable heel pad is similar to the Darco brace. It has the potential for slipping and may require adjustment on a regular basis. Since there is no hinge at the ankle joint the plantar and dorsiflexion capabilities of this brace are more restricted than others. The straps used to secure the stirrup are wide and comfortable. Aircast Air-Stirrups come in three models and there is a wide overlap among the models recommended for indication and patient size.

<P><B>OMNI Scientific Multi-Phase.</B> The Multi-Phase ankle orthosis can function either as a fixed brace for acute injuries or allow plantar and dorsiflexion for post acute or prevention considerations. However, its full range of capabilities do not follow the anatomical orientation as well as other braces reviewed. This brace may be helpful for certain foot and ankle conditions but, as with the Sure Step, it does not fully address the variations of foot structure found in many patients. The straps on this brace are a little more complicated than most stirrup braces and include an extra strap on the midfoot to hold the foot orthosis in place. The company states that its focal compression plate pad is designed to "facilitate translocation of edema up its drainage channel to the soft tissues of the leg." This brace is fitted by size and width of the foot and comes in men's and women's sizes.
<P><B>Johnson &#38; Johnson AS3.</B> The newest entrant to the stirrup brace field is Johnson &#38; Johnson's AS3 with Floam, which is similar to the other stirrup braces in providing medial and lateral ankle support. The AS3's Velcro straps may be uncomfortable if not fitted properly and the heel platform is a thin nylon material that allows shifting of the brace. The special Floam inserts are a combination neoprene with a foam type of resilience that is comfortable and supportive. It's also simple to put on and fits easily into most shoes.
<CENTER>
<H2>FULL ANKLE SUPPORT BRACES</H2>
</CENTER>
<B>Medical Specialties ASO.</B> The Ankle Stabilizing Orthosis is made of a thin but strong ballistic lightweight nylon with a neoprene inner sleeve for comfort. This brace is laced up in the front of the foot and can be tightened enough to avoid slipping. It provides the most support for the subtalar joint as well as inversion and eversion through the use of nylon straps that mirror the taping techniques of athletic taping. These straps incorporate stirrup and heel locking to provide the desired support and come with optional plastic stays for added lateral and medial stability. The straps are easy to use and can be adjusted without removing the shoe. This ambidextrous brace fits easily into most athletic shoes. Size the ASO by taking a circumferential measurement around the malleoli from the heel to the dorsal crease of the ankle while wearing an athletic sock.

<P><B>Smith &#38; Nephew DonJoy RocketSoc.</B> The RocketSoc ankle brace comes in two versions: nylon and neoprene. The nylon version laces up the front. The brace has plastic stays along the medial and lateral sides as well as a half moon foam support on the superior medial and lateral sides above the malleoli. Included with the brace is an extra half moon foam support for the inferior aspect of the malleoli for acute inflammation. The Nylon RocketSoc offers three straps: two provide lateral stirrup support that also help lock the heel and the third strap anchors the first two. The straps are lettered (A,B,C) for easy identification and order of use. The neoprene ankle brace is similar to the nylon-lace up version but deploys five straps instead of three. Instead of lacing, the neoprene uses Velcro closures to allow a firm and comfortable fit of the sleeve. The five-strap mechanism is similar to the lace up version because it uses two lateral straps as stirrups and heel locks at the same time. The other three are used mainly to secure the stirrup straps. All the straps are lettered (A,B,C,D,E) for ease of application and order of use. The plastic stays and half moon inserts also are provided with this brace. These two versions are much bulkier and take more time to put on than other braces.

<P><B>Swede-O Ankelok.</B> The Swede-O ankle brace has a patented "Ankle Lok" offset flap and close spaced eyelet system that the manufacturer says will hold the ankle more securely than other lace-up ankle braces. When fitted correctly this Ankle Lok system does a good job securing the talocrural and subtalar joints. The Swede-O comes with built-in metal u-shaped stays to provide lateral support and has optional stabilizers that can be added for additional support. The supports do not work as well as some of the other braces evaluated with stirrup straps used for inversion and eversion support. This brace has an elastic back that is supposed to ensure unrestricted blood flow to the Achilles tendon and help avoid blistering. 
<P>None of the many different braces available on the market today has everything you would require for all patients, types of injuries or lifestyles. So until the ideal brace is developed, evaluate each patient's individual needs and injury and fit them with a brace that matches their specifics.

<HR>
<P>Proximal femoral focal deficiency (PFFD) is a congenital defect of the proximal femur generally seen in children's hospitals or in prosthetic facilities that see a high percentage of pediatric amputees. For most Americans, PFFD is treated early in life. As such, when an adult PFFD patient comes into your office, you may experience difficulty in defining prescription criteria, fitting a prosthesis, and even in some phase of the fabrication process.
<P>Aitken coined the term "proximal femoral focal deficiency" and stressed four points inherent to PFFD: inequality of leg length, malrotation, inadequacy of proximal musculature, and instability of proximal joints. Each factor has its own special dynamic when the patient is an adult.

<P><B>Leg Length Discrepancy.</B> Of the four points, leg length discrepancy provides the greatest challenge. The actual length of the proximal femur and whether the epiphiseal growth plate has been arrested, and at what age, determine which type of prosthetic componentry can be used. If the adult PFFD has an amputation level that is at the knee or above, then there are few limitations on the choices of knee-shin-foot systems. Contractures, malrotations, and weak musculature, however, can affect prescription criteria at this level.
<P>Amputations below the level of the anatomical knee center complicate fabrication and fitting techniques. If the patient's foot has been removed, the two most common choices for a prosthesis are outside joints and an exoskeletal wood knee-shin. The exoskeletal choice has a much lower knee center than the sound side, but the outside joints that are placed at or just below the anatomical knee center may have a tendency to restrict knee flexion through clothing. The distal socket section extends beyond the joint center and does not allow free flexion of the knee due to limited space within the clothing. A compromise is usually indicated when using outside joints. To prevent noise and reduce wear on the joints, a check strap to stop the joints from hitting the stops also must be added. 
<P>The choices among feet and ankles are numerous. First obtain feedback on the patient's activities and evaluate remaining skeletal structures and muscle strength. Knee stability through knee joint alignment and type of foot are important to PFFD patients at this amputation level. Those with stable proximal anatomical joints (i.e., hip and knee) and adequate hip musculature can ambulate with almost any prosthetic foot and not experience difficulty. Patients with proximal deficiency may require a single axis or multi-axis foot to help obtain knee stability.
<P>Adult PFFDs who still have the foot remaining, and that level is below the other anatomical knee center, do not present much of a problem with component selection. Most are fit without a knee joint if, as stated, the affected side of the foot is below the anatomical knee center on the sound side. The exception to this are patients with a Van Ness rotation-plasty. The prosthesis is constructed with a solid build-up from the top of the prosthetic foot to the plantar surface of the anatomical foot. Slight shortening of the prosthesis to allow for clearance during swing may be required and some sort of movable prosthetic ankle joint may aid in mobility during stance phase.
<P><B>Malrotation.</B> Expect malrotation to be a serious concern. If as a child rotation deformities and contractures were not corrected, the gait of the adult PFFD patient will be poorer and less efficient than those who have had corrections. The selection of knee and foot systems may be limited to those that can provide maximum prosthetic knee stability, because the anatomical weightbearing line is less than desirable. Pronounced trunk lean, compensatory lumbar lordosis, less mobility, and cosmetic considerations (which may compromise ideal alignment) are disadvantages that accompany malrotation. The patient may also increase torque and stress on other anatomical joints.
<P>The Van Ness rotation plasty is a surgical procedure that turns the foot around backwards so the ankle joint can function as a knee joint and the heel and longitudinal arch are used as a weightbearing area. Although this procedure is performed less frequently today due to advancements in surgical techniques, practitioners still treat patients who have undergone Van Ness rotation plasty. The PFFD effectively is fit as a transtibial amputee. To provide adequate M-L stability, outside joints with thigh corset are almost always indicated in these cases. The type of prosthetic foot used is based on the individual needs of the patient, who will do well as long as the foot does not start to derotate. If it does, another surgical procedure may be indicated.

<P><B>Inadequate Proximal Musculature.</B> Instability of proximal joints is usually a result of PFFD directly. A malformation of the proximal femur and acetabulum causes a proximal sublaxation of the femur upon weightbearing. This is compounded by the inadequate ligaments and muscular structure. Inherent in all PFFDs is absent or severely compromised proximal hip musculature--the most common being the hip abductors--which cause exaggerated lateral trunk bending and an inefficient gait pattern. The weakness may require additional support about the hip and waist that can include a silesian belt, neoprene belt, or hip joint and pelvic band. These additions may reduce the patient's gait deviations. Since many of these patients ambulated in previous years without the belts, patient acceptance is an important consideration. Listen to the patient and carefully explain the advantages and disadvantages of specific componentry. 

<P><B>Instability of Proximal Joints.</B> As children, many PFFDs have their hip and/or knee fused to correct instability. Without this arthrodesis, they may experience gait deviations, inefficiency, and a generally uncosmetic walking pattern. Most important in reducing instability is a properly fitted socket and, as previously mentioned, belts can help stabilize the proximal joints and reduce rotation around the long axis of the residual limb.
<P>In some cases (patients with foot remaining, for example), locking up proximal joints will reduce flexibility enough to limit the individual's ability to perform activities below the waist such as tying shoes. Again, careful evaluation, preferably by a clinical team, is necessary to determine the correct prescription for these patients.

<P><B>Suspension.</B> Suspensions vary widely. If the foot has been amputated, a Symes-type of residual limb remains. Fabrication can be accomplished by making a medial, posterior, or lateral opening to allow for the bulbous distal end to be donned through the narrower proximal portion. The bulbous distal end creates the suspension.
<P>Another suspension method is to create a liner or sleeve donned over the residual limb. It is cylinder-shaped to allow passage into the prosthetic socket and is more structurally sound than one with an opening.
<P>If the patient still has his foot, a socket fabricated with an anterior opening just large enough to allow the foot to pass through is indicated. An anterior shell is added to prevent edema, add weightbearing area, and to allow better control with the prosthesis. Some patients may prefer no anterior shell because they can adequately suspend the prosthesis with the bulbous anterior proximal portion of their limb (inherent in most PFFDs) and foot. This design is also much cooler.
<P>In some specialized cases, the adult PFFD may have a deformity with a partial foot that will allow the patient to hold the prosthesis with their toes. A bar or shelf can be fabricated to allow patients to curl their toes around and thereby suspend the prosthesis.
<P>Finally, when fitting an adult PFFD patient who has undergone a Van Ness procedure, joints and corset are indicated. Due to the complexity of this procedure, these patients are unstable in the medial lateral plane and therefore the joints and thigh corset are necessary.

<P><B>Socket Fit.</B> Socket fit is the most important factor when dealing with an adult PFFD patient. An improperly shaped proximal contour will increase instability, reduce gait efficiency, decrease socket comfort, and reduce prosthetic wear.
<P>A number of PFFD clients have similarly shaped proximal residual limbs, which are bulbous anteriorly and rounded and then taper distally. This is due to the shortened proximal femur, joint structures, and malformed musculature. The socket should completely encompass this to the inguinal fold to provide rotational control and anterior-posterior stability. In conjunction, solid ischial support is important. If the foot has been amputated and the patient can bear weight distally, less ischial support is required. Even if distal weightbearing is tolerated, the socket trimlines should remain high to prevent instabilities and increase weightbearing areas. Designs can vary from patient to patient according to limb shape, but take care not to place undue stress on the malformed limb.
<P>Proximal femoral focal deficiencies are not common to most prosthetic practices. This does not mean, however, that they have to be difficult to treat. Evaluation by the entire clinical team is essential. Clearly, understanding the instabilities and malformations inherent in these patients is a must as is listening carefully to the adult you are treating. With proper evaluation from all members of the clinic team and invaluable input from the patient, most problems can be avoided.

<H1>Inshoe Plantar Pressure Measurement and Diabetic Inlays:
<BR>A Series of Questions and a Few Answers</H1>

<P><I>by Stephen F. Conti, MD</I> 
</CENTER>

<P>Foot and ankle related problems are the principle reasons diabetics are admitted to the hospital. Most common among these problems is insensitivity to pain due to peripheral neuropathy--a chronic complication of diabetes that affects the feet of approximately 20 percent of patients after 15 years of disease. 
<P>Today, the standard of care for patients with diabetic feet at risk for ulceration is to be treated with total contact inlays and depth footwear with rocker soles. Conceptually, such footwear is designed to redistribute plantar forces away from areas of high pressure to lessen the risk of developing a plantar ulcer. But we must first confront an array of difficult questions. How does footwear interact with the sole? Can we precisely define a total contact inlay? How often have we felt reassured after we have identified a patient at risk for ulceration and had him fit for total contact inlays and special shoes? When that same patient returns five months later with a plantar ulcer, how should he be treated? If the patient heals and reulcerates despite appropriate footwear, what should the physician think? Does this really represent a foot deformity that cannot be accommodated in footwear? Or does it represent a failure of the shoe? Or is it the insole? Do we understand how the shoe interacts with the foot qualitatively or quantitatively? With all these questions, plus an increased variety of materials available for the manufacture of orthoses and an increasingly sophisticated pedorthic community, it is unfortunate that physicians' approaches to prescribing therapeutic footwear for diabetic patients has remained unchanged during the last 20 years.
<P>Clearly, the two most important factors are neuropathy and pressure under the foot. Other factors include, in my view, the duration the force is applied, the rate of tissue loading, shear forces, and the local vascular environment of the tissue.
<P>Diabetic footwear is said to alter the distribution of forces under the foot and control shear. Although many manufacturers of insole materials claim their product reduces shear, it is a measurement that is very difficult to perform and, to my knowledge, has not been reported adequately, if at all. While there may be theoretical reasons to suspect that a material may reduce shear forces, there is no objective evidence to corroborate this. 
<P>Classic gait analysis literature describes the forces under a bare foot. These measurements are taken with instruments as technically simple as a Harris-Beath ink mat to devices as sophisticated as a computerized pedobarograph. Accompanied by gait analysis data, this has resulted in our current understanding of foot and ankle biomechanics and floor contact forces. This type of information can now be reproduced for the interaction between the foot and the shoe. The use of inshoe plantar pressure measuring devices attached to computer retrieval systems has enabled researchers to begin describing the forces the foot is subject to while in a shoe. This has enormous implications for the diabetic patient, since plantar pressure distribution is so important in the formation of plantar ulcers and is the only measurable parameter the clinician can alter.
<P>The question becomes: Is there a role for inshoe plantar pressure measurements in patients with diabetes mellitus who have been prescribed therapeutic footwear? The unanswered questions include:
<UL><LI>Are the initial total contact inlay and shoe doing an appropriate job of evenly distributing force over the sole? 
<P><LI>Can we compare the different types of total contact inlay materials and fabrication processes so that we can choose the best footwear for a given patient?
<P><LI>After some experience with inshoe plantar pressure measurements, can we suggest modifications that can be made during the initial fabrication process to avoid costly and time consuming adjustments in the future?
<P><LI>If a recurrent ulceration occurs, can we test the footwear to see if it has retained its pressure relieving properties rather than assuming that the patient has failed nonoperative treatment and must now have surgery?
<P><LI>Can we assess the durability properties of the inlays by following patients over time with sequential inshoe plantar pressure tests to see when the inlays lose their effectiveness and require revision? Would this allow us to suggest scheduled maintenance programs which would prevent patients from walking on footwear that had lost its effectiveness?
<P><LI>Can we use any of the information we gain by using inshoe plantar pressure measuring systems to aid in the design or manufacture of orthoses that will lessen the risk of plantar ulcerations in diabetic patients?</UL>

<P>Determining whether the total contact inlay is acceptable requires information on what is appropriate plantar pressure distribution. We also must have a reliable means to quantitatively make this measurement. Ideally, the diabetic shoe reduces the pressure at all areas to below a level that could cause tissue breakdown. Can we define an absolute force or pressure value above which the patient is likely to ulcerate and then work to manufacture orthoses that meet this criteria? Would this threshold value be better expressed as a percentage of bodyweight, i.e., 25 percent bodyweight? Equally important, is there a clinically useful measuring system that is affordable, accurate, reproducible, reliable, and can be used in a busy office practice? To date, there are no defined limits on the absolute or relative pressure threshold for ulceration of the foot. Therefore, we strive to reduce pressure at locations of the foot which seem at risk or where there has been previous breakdown. Since force is only one of the many factors that goes into producing an ulcer it is unlikely this number will ever be determined absolutely. 
<P>We began using an FScan inshoe plantar pressure measuring device at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center several years ago to record the plantar pressure distribution occurring under all diabetic feet that had been prescribed a new pair of total contact inlays and shoes. The inclusion criteria were all diabetic patients with clinically significant neuropathy determined by their inability to consistently feel the 5.07 Semmes Weinstein monofilament and a decreased vibratory perception threshold. 
<P>The total contact inlays and shoes were manufactured and fit by a certified pedorthist with more than 20 years of experience working in an accredited pedorthic facility. The orthoses were vacuum molded over a positive plaster mold of the patient's foot. The manufacturing process consisted of a tri-lamination of two polyethylene closed cell materials with 1/8-inch open cell urethane between the polyethylene material.
<P>Footwear was considered acceptable if during three consecutive steps the pressure anywhere on the plantar aspect of the foot did not exceed 25 percent bodyweight. Our intent was to make sure that no sensing element exceeded the 25 percent threshold. Naturally, this is a completely arbitrary number. We know we need a better one. However, with no prior data we chose this number because it seemed reasonable based on our previous study of feet in total contact casts and it was the lowest pressure we could consistently achieve through pedorthic manipulations. Two-thirds of the orthoses required modifications to achieve these goals when we first began using the plantar pressure measurements. 
<P>In some cases, multiple adjustments were necessary to bring the orthoses to specifications. Presently, our technique for manufacturing total contact inlays involves using the trilamination described above with Poron open cell urethane positioned under areas of clinically obvious bony prominences. With this simple alteration, we have to modify approximately only one-third of the new orthoses to meet our goals. We currently are assessing whether this protocol will reduce the incidence of plantar ulcerations in this population. 
<P>Based on our experience, we determined that optimizing the plantar pressure distribution should decrease the incidence of ulceration. However, since vertical force on the foot is only one factor responsible for plantar ulceration it is unclear how significant this will be in clinical practice. Preliminary observations suggest that a difference can be made by analyzing prescription footwear using an inshoe plantar pressure measuring device. In our experience, well-made orthoses can be improved with the input gained from inshoe plantar pressure data. The pedorthist gains enormous feedback from the visual display accompanying the computer printout. Normal and deformed feet respond differently to the same orthosis and simply adding better padding to an area with a bony prominence does not always continue to lower pressure in that area. In fact, adding more  padding beneath a plantar lesion could increase pressure at this location. When force is removed from one location, it must be placed somewhere else.
<P>Inshoe plantar pressure data can be a valuable resource to a multidisciplinary diabetic foot clinic. Whether this will prove to be a cost effective resource in a managed care environment remains to be seen.

<H1>ScanCast 3D: The Coming Standard</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Bet on ScanCast 3D
to be the industry standard within a year.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>The winner in the office-based optical foot scanning sweepstakes will be ScanCast 3D by Benefoot. Bergmann has an exquisitely capable scanner and ADT is hinting that after years of delay it may actually bring out a foot scanner, but no one is going to touch Benefoot as it proliferates its technology throughout the biomechanics mainstream. The ScanCast 3D will eventually become the industry standard.
<P>Today, ScanCast 3D's installed base is 50 systems. Thirty more have been ordered and are in production. By the end of the year, installed base and/or orders may exceed 100. By the end of next year that number may skyrocket to 500. Here's why. 
<P>ScanCast 3D is clearly not the most capable or powerful scanner. Bergmann's sophisticated 2000 and new 2001, which connect to a freestanding computer, employ an industrial-strength scanner from the Hollywood special effects world, and include well-coded foot scanning software that easily could function in a research setting. But ScanCast 3D is the most usable, sensible, portable, easy-to-use, and intelligent foot scanner available. It is ideally suited to the managed care practice in need of a real productivity boost.
<P>"We didn't want ScanCast 3D landlocked so it could only be used where the office computer is," explains Jason Kraus of Benefoot, "We went with a self-contained design." The totally portable ScanCast 3D houses the computer, modem, display, and power source. It even uses wireless technology to activate a remote printer via radio signals. Therefore, the ScanCast 3D can be wheeled easily into any treatment room. "We bring the technology to where the patients are, not the patients to the technology," adds Kraus. 
<P>The compact small touchscreen LCD dispenses with a keyboard. The foot is simply positioned, a few screen buttons are touched, and the image is captured.
<P>At the end of the day, the scanner is wheeled to the designated phone plug. There, the practitioner just touchscreens to tag patient files for transmission, and then goes home for dinner. The scanner is left unattended. Overnight, Benefoot's central computers dial up all the scanner labs and poll them for patient files marked for transmission. If they are tagged, file transmissions are initiated. The next morning, the remote printer provides a printed confirmation. 
<P>Next, Benefoot labs undertake the cast modifications required. A CAD-CAM positive is created, which becomes the basis for a conventional custom orthosis of any type or material. The end product is no different than one originating from a plaster or foam cast--just faster and less messy. Although Benefoot's system does not provide the practitioner with all the fabrication design capabilities that the Bergmann system does, Kraus argues--persuasively--that the scanner is designed to save the doctor time, not to add to it by turning him into an orthotech.
<P>ScanCast 3D captures a semi-weightbearing image which, Benefoot maintains, includes 3-D imaging up and around the heel. To accomplish this, the optics are arranged on a slight angle, not directly underfoot. As a result, some 3-D information is actually lost at the toes, which is rendered in 3-D. Benefoot maintains this is sufficient for its functional devices, which are three-quarter length. For accommodative, Benefoot can compensate for the 3-D toe area.
<P>More than anything else, ScanCast 3D's much discussed open architecture plan underscores Benefoot's commitment to making the ScanCast 3D an industry standard, not just a prescription fetcher for one lab. In January, we wrote about an aggressive plan for the ScanCast 3D to be connected to Bloch Orthotic Lab, and then six others. Benefoot originally planned to complete the software interface within weeks. Surprise, it didn't happen. Software development is much slower than software conceptualization. Kraus, however, confirms that the Bloch interface will be up by the time this issue reaches readers. He expects six more labs to go online by January 1, 1997. 
<P>In addition, Benefoot has taken a major leap forward in private labelling of the ScanCast 3D for various specialty groups. For example, in chiropractic, the Somathotics custom lab is selling the SomaScan. A project is now underway to address the special needs of orthotists and prosthetists. Within two years, each profession within the biomechanics mainstream could have access to a ScanCast 3D built to meet the individual needs of their specialty.
<P>Benefoot is doing more than just selling practitioners on office-based datacasting. A variation of the ScanCast 3D is being deployed across America to create custom shoes. The much-publicized Custom Foot stores have purchased two scanners per store. ScanCast 3Ds also may be used in a hoped-for practitioner-driven retail operation. Such projects are now abuzz overseas as well. A Korean quasi-retail group has already purchased a ScanCast 3D. At press time, Benefoot scanners either are planned or already installed in offices in Canada, England, and Israel. But this is just the beginning.
<P>ScanCast 3D will become the industry standard because it is the right product for the right market at the right time. And the people behind it understand the biomechanics, economics, and technology of the orthotic field, as well as the marketing fervor required to make the device a universal standard. That is why we are willing to declare them the winner even before the horserace begins in earnest. So will you if you just take a look around the corner.

<H1>Who's Using What: 
An Orthotic Materials Survey</H1>
<P><I>by James Foto, C.Ped &#38; James A. Birke, PhD, PT, C.Ped</I> 
</CENTER>

<P>Sensory loss and abnormal stresses are the primary cause of plantar foot problems in diabetes, leprosy, spina bifida, and other neuropathic conditions. Accommodative footwear, orthoses, and other total contact appliances have proven to be effective in reducing plantar foot stresses. Studies have shown that an accommodative appliance made of a soft, moldable material such as Plastazote foam best reduces damaging stresses. However, evidence of permanent breakdown--referred to as bottoming out--is apparent with this material at a less than desirable rate when used as single density orthoses. Empirical data suggests that combining materials of different densities and molecular structure will not only reduce the rate of material breakdown, but will actually synergistically enhance the properties of each material.
<P>The staff of the Gillis W. Long Hansen's Disease Center in Carville, Louisiana undertook a <A HREF="#survey">survey</A> to determine the most commonly used single and multi-density materials in the fabrication of accommodative orthoses. We hope that our planned research will be meaningful to current clinical practice. 
<P>Surveys were mailed to 92 members of the Foot and Ankle Special Interest Group of the American Physical Therapy Association, 1,171 members of the Prescription Footwear Association, 1,200 members of the American Podiatric Medical Association, and 1,239 members of the American Orthotics and Prosthetics Association. 
<P>Prior to mailing, the survey was reviewed for content validity by experts in the field. For the purpose of this study, materials judged to be of similar composition and/or performance were grouped together on the survey form. The use of trade names was not an endorsement for their use.
<P>The overall response rate was 14.3 percent (531 out of 3,702). Individually, the special interest group of physical therapists yielded the best response of 22 percent (20 out of 92), followed by pedorthists with 18 percent (212 out of 1,171), podiatrists with 12 percent (145 out of 1,200), and orthotists and prosthetists with 8.5 percent (104 out of 1,239). Fifty additional respondents were considered only in the overall outcome and not in the groupings since the professional title on their surveys was incomplete. The list of materials was compiled based on consultations within the industry on leading materials commonly used. They were then printed in the mailed survey. The top five single density and multi-density materials selected by respondents overall are marked with an X.
<P>Let's understand the results: overall, within specialties and among individuals. There were differences in the preferences various specialities identified--with one exception: Plastazote #1 was the unanimous first choice for single density material among all professions. The remaining four single density choices X'ed were all chosen by the professional groups but with a different ranking order within each professional group.
<P>For multi-density materials, the unanimous first and second choices were Plastazote #1 + Poron/PPT followed by Plastazote #1 + Plastazote #2. The remaining three multi-density choices were the overall statistical outcomes, but not necessarily the ones selected by each professional group. For example, Spenco + Plastazote #2 was one of the top five selections in the podiatry group, yet it was not ranked in the top five overall. 
<P>Most interesting was the category "other," which in all groups except the physical therapists most often constituted an individual's number one choice. A total of 118 respondents wrote in their own choice for multi-density materials. In 36 instances, the write-in was identified as the number one choice. Those 36 follow:

<P>Bocklite + ProXPII or 
<UL>    Microcel Puff or Cork</UL>
<BR>EVA + NBS or Neolon
<BR>Felt + Plastazote #1
<BR>Leather + Cork

<BR>Plastazote #1 + Plastazote #3

<BR>Plastazote #1 + UCOlite
<BR>Plastazote #1 + UCOlite + Poron
<BR>Plastazote #1 + UCOlite + Poron
<BR>Plastazote #2 + Aliplast 10
<BR>Plastazote #2 + Plastazote #3
<BR>Plastazote #2 + Poron
<BR>Plastazote #2 + Poron + Orthocork
<BR>Plastazote #2 + Poron + Orthocork
<BR>Plastazote #2 + Thermocork
<BR>Plastazote #2 + XPE
<BR>Plastoform + Spenco + UCOlite
<BR>Poron + Various Modulus Poron
<BR>Poron + Viscoelastic Polymer
<BR>PPT + Aliplast 10 + UCOlite
<BR>Spenco + Microcel Puff + Thermocork
<BR>Spenco + Nickelplast + Plastazote #3
<BR>Spenco + PPT
<BR>Spenco + ProXPII
<BR>Spenco + XPE
<BR>Spenco or PPT + Cork
<BR>Tepe 7 + PPT
<BR>UCOlite + PPT + EVA
<BR>UCOlite + PQ
<BR>Volara4E + Volara10E

<P>The survey does not identify which layer of the multi-density combinations is used against the foot, but we assume the foot interface layer is the first material listed in any multi-density arrangement. Results indicate respondents favor the use of soft materials such as Plastazote, Poron, or Spenco as an interface with the foot for single or multi-density orthoses, while firm materials are commonly used for the base layer of multi-density orthoses. A soft interface with the foot is not only effective in reducing plantar pressures, it is thought to be an effective way to reduce shear stresses on patients who are at a high risk of foot injuries. Results indicate respondents favor the use of dual density versus triple density materials. Dual density may be considered more cost effective or a third intermediate density material may seem unnecessary.
<P>Practitioners should not conclude that the more popular materials or material combinations are the most effective in reducing stresses on the foot. Further investigation is necessary to decide whether these multi-density material combinations effectively reduce damaging stresses such as pressure and shear while remaining durable for long term use.

<H1>Using Appropriate Footwear with Transmetatarsal Amputations</H1>
<P><I>by Michael J. Mueller, PhD, PT</I> 

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>A custom-made shoe with a molded accommodative insert and a rigid rocker bottom is a successful prescription for TMA patients.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>

<HR>
<P>About 10,000 transmetatarsal amputations (TMA) are performed each year in the United States. Provided the patient meets the necessary surgical criteria, a TMA is generally considered preferable to a transtibial amputation because it saves the ankle and a portion of the foot, and allows a weightbearing residuum. Most TMAs are performed on patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and foot disease. Most have peripheral neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease--medical complications that place the TMA patient at high risk for subsequent skin breakdown or higher amputation. Various studies indicate TMA failure rates from 17 to 76 percent with an average failure rate of 30 percent.
<P>Given the potential for wound failure and skin breakdown, selecting the appropriate footwear for TMA patients is important. Sensory neuropathy, equinus deformity, and a loss of the toes and metatarsal phalangeal joints complicate the process.

<H2>Postoperative Footwear</H2>
The greatest percentage of wound failures in patients with TMA occurs within the first three months of surgery. Postoperative management and protection of the residuum is critical and should be considered carefully. Most patients appear unable to comply with orders to remain strictly non-weightbearing after surgery. Peripheral neuropathy can eliminate the painful, but precautionary, warning signs of trauma to the acute wound. Despite best efforts to instruct patients to use walkers or crutches, patients often appear unaware that they actually are walking on a freshly amputated foot. 
<P>Theoretically, a total-contact cast provides maximum immobilization and protection to the residuum as the patient recovers from surgery and resumes walking. The total-contact cast has proven highly successful for healing neuropathic plantar wounds. Most surgeons, however, are reluctant to have the wound inaccessible between cast changes. Compromises to a total-contact cast include a resting splint or some type of clamshell orthosis, which can protect the foot from trauma during walking, but are removable and allow easy access for wound care. A rigid, protective clamshell boot also may help position the foot and prevent equinus deformities. Care should be taken that the splint or orthosis does not traumatize the susceptible contralateral extremity during functional activities.
<P>At an absolute minimum, patients should be provided a postoperative boot with an accommodative insert. A rocker-bottom sole on the postoperative boot helps to reduce pressures at the distal residuum, which seems particularly susceptible to breakdown.

<H2>Definitive Footwear</H2>
Once the wound has healed, the patient is ready for definitive footwear. Too often, patients are told to wear a good pair of shoes with a toe filler of wool or cotton. Although this may be adequate for patients with intact sensation and no other complications, it can be disastrous for patients with fragile skin or peripheral neuropathy. Patients with peripheral neuropathy are unable to feel repetitive trauma to the distal residuum. In addition to the potential for skin breakdown at the distal residuum, the heel tends to slide out of the shoe with each step.
<P>During the last three years, we have tested six different types of footwear on 30 patients with TMA, analyzing the effects on function, cosmetic acceptance, and peak pressures on the residuum. Our findings suggest that a successful footwear prescription for most patients with DM and a TMA is a custom-made shoe with a molded, total-contact insert and a rigid, rocker-bottom sole (RRB). The total-contact insert maximizes the available weightbearing surface area and thus decreases peak plantar pressures that can traumatize the foot. The RRB sole helps substitute for the missing metatarsal-phalangeal joints and allows the patient to roll over the distal residuum without injury to insensitive skin. Many clinicians mistakenly place the apex of the rocker at the position of the preexisting metatarsal phalangeal joints; it must be placed proximal to the distal residuum or the patient will continue having difficulty rolling over and may end up traumatizing the residuum. 
<P>In addition, any equinus deformity should be accommodated with a heel lift. A limitation in dorsiflexion range-of-motion places additional stresses on the distal residuum during the late stance phase of walking. A heel lift accommodates this limitation and allows the lower leg to rotate over the foot during walking.
<P>Some practitioners recommend a custom-made short shoe as long as the residuum to protect the residuum maximally. Our research suggests that a short shoe is no more protective than a regular length shoe, provided the apex of the RRB is placed proximal to the distal residuum on the long shoe. Moreover, many will not accept this cosmesis.
<P>A plastic ankle-foot-orthosis (AFO) rarely seems to be needed for patients with TMA. Indications for an AFO include foot drop or a very short residuum. An AFO helps to secure a short residuum in the shoe and minimizes pistoning of the heel.
<P>One patient in our study seems representative of the population of patients with DM and TMA who may develop problems. The patient was 64 years old with noninsulin-dependent diabetes for 22 years, insensitivity at both feet, and a left TMA. She had an ulcer at the distal plantar residuum, ambulated with the assistance of a walker, and wore regular shoes with a toe-filler. Her heel pistoned out of the shoe about 3/4-inch while walking. We provided her custom-made shoes with a total-contact insert and RRB soles. At the initial check of her shoes, we noticed her heel continued to piston excessively. Inspecting her footwear, we noticed the apex of the rocker was mistakenly placed distal to her residuum. After the apex was moved proximal to the residuum, the patient walked more easily without pistoning of her heel. Six weeks later the plantar ulcer was healed and the patient ambulated without a walker.
<P>Most patients with a TMA have multiple medical complications that place them at high risk for skin breakdown and wound failure, especially in the first three months following surgery. Postoperative management should maximize protection of the residuum as the patient returns to weightbearing activities. Once the wound is healed, the patient should be provided with definitive footwear. In our experience, a full-length shoe with a molded, accommodative insert and a rigid rocker-bottom sole is a successful prescription for most patients with DM and TMA.

<HEAD><TITLE>BioMechanics July/August 1996 Prefab Orthoses--A Mini-Survey of 50 Prefab Users</TITLE></HEAD> 

<A HREF="/biomech/jul96/"><IMG SRC="/biomech/biomech.gif" WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=48 ALT="BioMechanics logo"></A>

<CENTER>
<H1>A Mini-Survey of 50 Prefab Users</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
</CENTER>

<P><CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> recently conducted a mini-survey of practitioners who use prefabricated orthoses. We took the first 50 qualified respondents who faxed their responses before deadline and came up with some interesting insights. No one can draw any conclusions about overall prefabricated use from just 50 respondents. One day, we'll do a more in-depth survey. So rather than just shoot some dry numbers your way, we thought we would provide some subjective insights based upon our knowledge of the field and what these 50 practitioners--orthopedic surgeons, podiatrists, pedorthists, physical therapists, and orthotists--told us. My short report is that prescribers are acting out of economic mandate and are satisfied with the clinical results. But there's much more. 
<P>All the specialities are using prefabricated devices. A majority of respondents said that prefabs constitute more than half of their total prescriptions, and a quarter said they used prefabs 75 percent or more of the time. Indeed, some indicated they have all-prefab treatment approaches. About 40 percent said they use prefabs less than a quarter of the time. Our respondents prescribed prefabs as many as 60 per week, although the average was 10 per week.
<P>More than half of the respondents confirmed they prescribe both functional and accommodative prefabs. More than 60 percent added that they also used prefabs for comfort applications. More than 70 percent said they prescribed prefabs for their geriatric patients. Slightly less than half of all respondents said they also prescribe premolds for athletic, diabetic, and occupational patients. More than a third included pediatric patients.
<P>The single most common pathology addressed was plantar fasciitis, according to more than 84 percent of respondents, followed by metatarsalgia cited by 82 percent. About half of the respondents added tibial posterior tendinitis and shin splits to the list. Less than half specified a gamut of pathologies, including emerging hallux valgus-limitus, patella femoral syndrome, strains and sprains, lumbar pain, neuroma, knee and hip tendinitis, as well as osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, and spine.
<P>As for the clinical results, virtually all respondents claimed they were satisfied with prefab treatment to some extent. The group divided into thirds between somewhat satisfied, satisfied, or very satisfied. Ironically, when asked if they used prefabs for efficacy or economics, efficacy came in a distant second. Slightly more than a third ranked efficacy as the number one reason they use prefabs. They included such rationales as "conservative start," "temp until custom are in," and "when no advantage to custom."
<P>Yet, more than half of the respondents ranked economics as the number one reason. A disturbing and unacceptable sense of frustration became clear, however, as some practitioners appeared to resent their new reliance on inexpensive, economically mandated devices. A number of practitioners said they prescribed for "cheap patients," or "economically challenged patients," or quite simply "the HMO." Clearly, a segment of the biomechanics mainstream is unhappy about how economic realities have affected their choices in orthotic treatment. 
<P>The single most popular material was Plastazote. Nearly 60 percent cited Plastazote as their preferred prefab material. That won't surprises anyone, and dovetails with a similar finding by the Foto Survey of Materials found in this month's <A HREF="/biomech/jul96/materials.html">Materials</A> column. Poron came in second with some 40 percent preferring it. Approximately a quarter of the respondents voted for polyurethane and viscoelastic. But demonstrating the diversity of materials used, nearly 40 percent wrote in their own preferred materials, including neoprene, rubber, TL2100, polypropylene, and Spenco.
<P>The brand names the respondents checked showed a virtual barometer of marketing prowess. Marketing efforts include advertising, dealer support, convention presence, professional association sponsorships, and direct sales. At the top of the list was Spenco, prescribed by nearly 70 percent of our respondents. That's interesting because although the Spenco product is quite good, they are still primarily insoles (although Spenco does field one heat moldable device it calls an "orthotic"). That means practitioners are prescribing an inexpensive drugstore insole to do the work of a genuine medical orthosis. Spenco's continuing success can be attributed to history and quality. Spenco has a long beard when it comes to prefab marketing (although their efforts have declined lately), and for some time it had few rivals in the medical marketplace. That market entrenchment shows and many practitioners speak institutionally about Spenco as a viable solution.
<P>About a quarter of respondents said they use Sorbothane and Silipos products. Both of these companies have undertaken substantial marketing campaigns. Silipos has been in the field about seven years, is constantly rolling out new products, and shows a lot of marketing savvy. Sorbothane is marketed to healthcare by IEM Technologies, which maintains a heavy convention schedule and advertising commitment.
<P>About 20 percent of respondents said they use Dr. Scholl's and Hapad products, again both heavily promoted in their own way. The penetration of Dr. Scholl's caught me off-guard. I have heard more than a few practitioners speak with some derision about Dr. Scholl's' drugstore insoles, but perhaps the megadollars Dr. Scholl's has plowed into podiatry has yielded a dividend, because podiatric respondents say the product is being used. Scholl's is getting ready to capitalize on that dividend by offering a genuine medical-grade prefabricated foot orthosis.

<P>Some 15 percent of our respondents checked off Pedifix products. That's interesting as well since Pedifix has a far greater market penetration than 15 percent of the biomechanics community. Indeed, the Preform by Pedifix is so well-entrenched it is referred to generally in the same way Kleenex is for tissue (much to the disdain of Pedifix). But Preforms were popularized when the company was known as Berkemann. Recently, Berkemann underwent a name change to Pedifix. Others in the 15 percent category were Johnson &#38; Johnson's Specialist and Bauerfeind's Viscoped as well as several others. Again, demonstrating the diversity, approximately 40 percent of respondents wrote in their own brand names, with the Podothotic by Northwest Labs being the most common, followed by products marketed by Atlas and Alimed as well as KLM Orthotic Labs, which makes a prefab version of most of its custom devices.
<P>Some specialty-specific closing thoughts. It is often thought that orthopedists and physical therapists generally rely upon prefabs, and that podiatrists, pedorthists, and orthotists eschew them in favor of custom devices. But these generalizations are false. Many orthopedists and physical therapists rely upon custom devices--both rigid and accommodative. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. On the other hand, a great many podiatrists, pedorthists, and orthotists employ prefabs in far greater numbers than they generally are willing to admit. For professionals who have a tradition of plaster or foam casting, and who have long looked down upon prefabs, that admission is made reluctantly. Many professionals in the custom tradition simply will not admit they use prefabs, but that was before the onset of managed care extremis. In addition, some use customizable prefabs, falsely believing that the customizing raises the appliance from the realm of the prefab into a bona fide custom.
<P>Today, quality prefabs are in use everywhere. Custom sources such as Benefoot, PAL, and Allied-OSI are creating new-fangled high-end customizables capable of simultaneously addressing clinical and economic realities. And others such as Orthofeet, Kendall, Silipos, and Bauerfeind are rushing to develop newer and better models.
<P>Although all the specialities of the biomechanics mainstream prescribe prefabs in abundance, the most numerous prescribers are podiatrists. That's due to the sheer fact that podiatrists treat more feet than any other group and prescribe more foot orthoses than anyone else. Moreover, podiatrists have sought the prefab device as a solution to managed care woes. Although podiatrists are the largest dispensers--and currently represent the largest growth sector for these products--the general expansion of orthotic treatment and research is causing substantial growth in all the professions. My guess is that within a year, the largest growth in prefab deployment will be physical therapists, chiropractors, and the rehab specialties, again because of the sheer numbers of those groups. Moreover, as the biomechanics mainstream continues to adopt prefabs, you will see other providers prescribing them as well, particularly in osteopathy, family practice, and even OB-GYN (they are now increasingly addressing back pain during pregnancy).
<P>None of the above means that custom devices will be outmoded. There will always be a demand for the custom device. But increasingly, the custom device is not the default solution. Managed care and a new clinical understanding have rightly seen to that.

<H2>Craig Shergold lives on</H2>
A reader recently emailed <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> about a Benefoot request that business cards be sent to one "Craig Shergold," who once upon a time was dying of a brain tumor. Shergold wanted to make the Guiness Book of World Records before he died, collecting the cards as a final wish. But then he recovered. That was years ago. Yet the chain letters have never stopped. Shergold and the charities have pleaded on television for the card sending to stop. Moreover, new chain letters have cropped up. This hoax never seems to die. Even giant companies such as Johnson &#38; Johnson, IBM, and AT&#38;T continue to get suckered by the charitable impulse. Unfortunately, millions of business cards have caused a postal and storage nightmare for all the charities that receive and process them unopened. The Make-A-Wish Foundation's Web site says it all at <A HREF="http://www.wish.org/wish/craig.html">http://www.wish.org/wish/craig.html</A>.
<P>"An unauthorized chain letter encouraging people to send business cards to a seriously ill boy continues to generate thousands of pieces of mail each day, even though the boy is now healed and the family has requested an end to the mail. 'The chain letter claims that Make-A-Wish is involved,' stated James E. Gordon, chairman of the board of the Make-A-Wish Foundation of America. 'That is not true. Our organization is not, and has never been associated with the letter.  Yet our office continues to receive numerous phone calls each month about the letter, diverting our staff time and resources from our mission. The Make-A-Wish Foundation requests that people please stop sending business cards or greeting cards to Craig Shergold.'" Make-A-Wish has even set up an 800 number to explain. Call (800) 215-1333, ext 184.

<P>No one may ever report an accurate count of the health practitioners supporting the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. Even the incomplete numbers are staggering. More than 10,700 world-class athletes from 197 nations hurled themselves into punishing training schedules and body-challenging venues. Ready to support the athletes and their families, on and off venue, were more than 4,100 medical volunteers for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games. That number includes 700 physicians, 300 athletic trainers, 125 physical therapists, 50 nurses, and 500 emergency medical practitioners and paramedics. What's more, there were medical teams assigned to nations, to teams within nations, and even personal doctors for high-profile athletes.
<P>Suddenly, thousands of practitioners concentrated in biomechanics--orthopedists, podiatrists, clinical athletic trainers, kinesiologists, chiropractors, massage therapists, and many more from vision care to dentistry--were thrown together in one massive effort to help the Games succeed. 
<P>It was undoubtedly a spectacular experience for each and every one of them. All their stories could fill many volumes. So <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> asked six key medical service professionals to share their personal stories and reflect on their involvement as Olympic practitioners: an orthopedist, a podiatrist, a physical therapist, a chiropractor, a clinical athletic trainer, and a massage therapist. Each of them offers a private mini-perspective, whether clinical, experiential, or just commentary. Together they form a fraction of the impression this awesome event surely made on the physicians and other practitioners who volunteered their time and effort. Read their accounts and wonder how you might have felt serving athletes in make-it, break-it moments of personal glory or defeat.

<H2>Breaking Records and Protecting Athletes</H2>
<P><I>by Donald E. Baxter, MD</I> 
<IMG SRC="/biomech/sep96/baxter.jpg" WIDTH=87 HEIGHT=104 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Donald E. Baxter, MD"><P>This year's Olympics attracted more people than the Barcelona and Seoul Games combined. One of the highlights was Carl Lewis's leap into history as, in my opinion, the greatest Olympian of all times. As Team Physician for the Santa Monica Track Club, I had the pleasure of sitting with Evelyn, his mother, and Carol, his sister, on both electrifying occasions: when he made his qualifying-round jump and his gold-medal winning jump. Understandably, everyone in our section was exceptionally tense before both events. For eight months beforehand, my good friend Mary Cullen and my wife, Frances, accompanied Carl to yoga classes and to visit a nutritionist. Carl did his yoga meditation right by the runway as he prepared to do the jumps that qualified him and earned him his ninth gold medal. I am sure that, in addition to his natural talent, Carl's strict diet and concentration have helped make him into a great athlete.
<P>While Lewis's Olympics career was coming to an end, some careers were just beginning. I was proud of LaMont Smith, one of our young runners, who overcame a stress reaction in his leg to win a gold in the 1,600-meter relay. He ran a 44.5-second opening leg in that race.
<P>Other athletes I have worked with were also competing. I have treated Mary Onyali of Nigeria, who finished third in the 200-meter run, and Joaquim Cruz, who won a gold medal in the L.A. Olympics and a silver medal in Seoul, for an entrapment and impingement of the deep peroneal nerve by the inferior extensor retinaculum and talonavicular joint at the anterior ankle. 
<P>Another former patient I watched with pride was Lawrence Johnson of Tennessee. Johnson did extremely well in the pole vault, missing at 19 feet, 2 inches. He finished out of medal contention, but his repaired ankle deltoid and spring ligaments held up well.
<P>Less fortunate was Leroy Burrell, also of the Santa Monica Track Club, who was to compete in the 400-meter relay. I have taken care of this team for 16 years, so when I received a call from coach Tom Tellez, I knew it wasn't social. "Leroy Burrell has an Achilles problem. Please come check his leg!" Tellez said. The Achilles was inflamed with acute tendinitis. As I write this article, Burrell is preparing for an MRI of his Achilles. In the past year, he has recovered from a chronic plantar fasciitis and pulled a hamstring and a calf muscle. On top of all this, his world record was surpassed in the event he missed.
<P>Twenty years ago, athletes ended their careers because of injuries. Today, those types of injuries are being detected and treated successfully. Athletes now can stay in peak condition longer. With increased performance, the challenge is to keep the Olympic Games medically safe. My biggest concern is athletes who take performance-enhancing drugs, some of which can't be detected more than four hours after use. These drugs, plus commercialism and scientifically hardened tracks and jumping boards, may help to break records but could destroy athletes in the process.

<H2>Medical Overkill at the Olympics</H2>
<P><I>by Peter A. Harmer, ATC</I>
<IMG SRC="/biomech/sep96/harmer.jpg" WIDTH=84 HEIGHT=102 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Peter A. Harmer, ATC">
<P>After working at more than 12 world athletic championships in the past eight years, I thought I had experienced almost every possible permutation of medical care organization. However, the Olympic Games clearly bring a different dimension to the table--and my overriding impression was "overkill." 
<P> It was evident very early in my assignment that the organizing principles for medical care were redundancies and contingencies (the motto for Olympic care might well be "have more of everything than you might ever conceivably need"). Although healthcare providers who work regularly with elite-level athletes are mindful of the need to be prepared, the frenetic effort in Atlanta to cover all eventualities was probably unique in the history of medicine. 
<P>The result was uneven at best. On the plus side, I met a large number of colleagues drawn from different fields from around the country. These included physicians, nurses, athletic trainers, massage therapists, and EMT's. Every variety of treatment approach was in evidence. The abundance of personnel also meant we could be rotated off to attend events or recuperate. Despite all this, I'm not sure having so many people on site significantly enhanced athlete care. The medical staff at the events I attended were underutilized--too many people simply had too little to do. The rationale, of course, was the specter of what might happen not on a field of play but nearby--a shadow that became a deadly reality when a bomb went off in Centennial Park.
<P>Yet for all the contingency-based planning, disturbing breakdowns in the system still took place. For example, on-site surgical facilities supposedly reduced the need for transporting athletes. However, in at least two cases (one involving a head injury, the other a neck injury), EMT units took from 30 minutes to an hour to arrive. In one case, nobody knew who was responsible for returning the athlete to the Olympic Village after he had been hospitalized. 
<P>In the final analysis, I appreciate the logistical challenge involved in organizing medical coverage of the scope the Olympic Games require. I admire greatly--my carping notwithstanding--those who rose to this task. But it seems too much for too little. Although I was moved by the spectacle of great performances and awed by the number of people willing to give their time and expertise to support the athletes in their quest for excellence, I wonder about the overarching concern of medical planning in terms of eventualities rather than actual athletic competition. 
<P>What about after the grand closing ceremony? Ironically, the majority of sports represented in Atlanta will find very few from our professions willing to volunteer to support them as they train and compete over the next four years.
<P>Perhaps it's time to revisit de Coubertin's vision and ask whether we have moved too far away.

<H2>An Olympic High</H2>
<P><I>by Steven Horwitz, DC</I>
<IMG SRC="/biomech/sep96/horwitz.jpg" WIDTH=80 HEIGHT=98 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Steven Horwitz, DC">
<P>I just completed the most exciting, exhausting, and rewarding month of my professional career. I was the sole chiropractor on the 44-person, 1996 United States Olympic Team medical staff. We were selected from a pool of physicians, chiropractors, and athletic trainers who applied to the United States Olympic Committee and entered the volunteer medical program between 1989 and 1994. 
<P>My journey to the Olympic Games in Atlanta actually started four years ago when I applied to the program. I spent 15 days treating athletes at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1994 and two weeks at the U.S. Olympic Festival in Boulder, Colorado, in 1995.
<P>To prepare for the Games themselves, I arrived in Atlanta on July 6, 1996. I was immediately processed, given my credentials, and taken to the Olympic Village at Georgia Tech. I reported to the U.S. Olympic Team training room, which had 14 therapy tables, 10 combination electrical stimulation units, a hydrocollator unit, an ice machine, and two chiropractic tables. The room was open from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m., with one trainer and one physician on call each night. Each trainer and physician were assigned specific sports, while I was responsible for any athlete who needed chiropractic care. We all worked 15 hours a day, every day. We were responsible for approximately 700 U.S. athletes.
<P>Working with professionals whose egos were checked at the door and whose common goal was the well-being of the athlete was a joy. The foundation of our care was the hands-on approach. Myofascial techniques, soft tissue and joint mobilization, joint manipulation, and stretching techniques were the norm. Different types of electrical stimulation and ultrasound complemented this approach. Medications were used when absolutely necessary. Hydrocollator packs and ice bags were the daily mainstays.
<P>Most of the injuries we treated were from overuse: tendinitis, sprains, and strains. Numerous athletes had nerve root irritation and trigger points, which I treated with chiropractic adjustments and myofascial techniques. I found that many athletes were accustomed to regular chiropractic care, especially during the heavy training just before the Olympics. They wanted to continue this care during the Games because they felt it helped injuries heal and enhanced their performance and feeling of well-being. Many other athletes were introduced to chiropractic care as they sustained injuries in need of treatment.
<P>My time was mostly spent in our treating room. But I did cover synchronized swimming, diving, and water polo practices, and I traveled to Lake Lanier to treat our rowers. During the last few days of the Games, I spent a lot of time with track and field between the warm-up track and the Olympic stadium.
<P>The dining hall was the most interesting area. An enormous air-conditioned tent was set up to hold 3,500 people. To look around and see athletes from 197 countries was fascinating. Each country's athletes would sit together, usually by sport. The multitude of languages made communicating a challenge. Hand gestures and body language made for lots of fun.
<P>But the biggest thrill for me was marching in the opening ceremonies. When I turned the corner and started down the ramp with the rest of the U.S. team, I was suddenly confronted with the spectacular sight of 85,000 spectators. The crowd was roaring "U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A." Flashbulbs were blazing everywhere. My high was incredible. I'll remember it for the rest of my life.

<H2>The Last Athlete in the Last Event</H2>
<P><I>by Perry H. Julien, DPM</I> 
<IMG SRC="/biomech/sep96/julien.jpg" WIDTH=82 HEIGHT=101 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Perry H. Julien, DPM">
<P>Shortly after Atlanta won its bid to host the centennial Olympics, I had the privilege of being selected by the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games to coordinate podiatric medicine for the Olympic Village Polyclinic and to serve as the medical administrator for the marathon and racewalking events.
<P>The Polyclinic provided medical services for more than 15,000 athletes, Olympic family, and staff who called the Village on the campus of Georgia Institute of Technology home for 33 days. Available at the Polyclinic were primary care, emergency medicine, orthopedics, podiatry, ophthalmology, dentistry, and other medical subspecialties, along with laboratory and radiology services.
<P>I coordinated a volunteer staff of 16 podiatrists to provide 16 hours of coverage per day in the clinic, the most extensive involvement for podiatry ever at the Olympics. Through generous donations, we were able to equip two treatment rooms with state-of-the-art treatment chairs, cabinetry, halogen lights, x-ray view boxes, and instruments. We also received pre-cut padding and pre-molded orthotic devices, along with the necessary equipment to make modifications and adjustments.
<P>During the Games, we saw more than 200 individuals with foot and ankle complaints. Many of these people had overuse syndromes such as plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinitis, stress fractures, and shin pain. However, we also treated non-sports-related problems such as foot infections, gout, and dermatologic complaints.
<P>One of the benefits of working in the clinic setting was the opportunity to interact and share information with other health professionals: not only the Polyclinic medical staff but team physicians and trainers from other countries. Approximately 25 percent of our patients were referred from primary care, orthopedics, and athletic trainers within the Polyclinic, while the rest were self-referred or referred by their national Olympic Committee's medical staff.
<P>My other responsibility was as medical administrator for the three racewalks and two marathons. The combination of an early start time and relatively mild weather plus a well-prepared medical team allowed for a safe race, with no athletes requiring extensive medical care on the course or at the finish.
<P>Every practitioner brought back a special moment. For me it came at the end of the Games. The last finisher of the men's marathon had finally entered Olympic Stadium, more than four hours after he began the race. The track was already being prepared for closing ceremonies. But a path was cleared for him--the last athlete to finish the last event. He was last, but he was greeted with cheers by the volunteers who remained. As I watched him finish, I could only imagine what my thoughts were compared with his. The hundreds of hours I had spent in preparation for these Games seemed a very small price to pay for being able to share in the Olympic experience.

<H2>Massage Was the Message</H2>
<P><I>by Sue Kozisek, MT</I> 
<IMG SRC="/biomech/sep96/kozisek.jpg" WIDTH=82 HEIGHT=100 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Sue Kozisek, MT">
<P>Massage was everywhere at the Olympics this year, the first year massage therapy was an official branch of the Olympic Games Medical Services. The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games selected 125 massage therapists to participate. In addition, there were therapists from the United States Olympic Committee, physiotherapists who accompanied foreign teams, and personal massage therapists. 
<P>Each venue had a medical team available that consisted of a physician, a physical therapist, an athletic trainer, and a sports massage therapist. True camaraderie developed as we worked together to assess and treat the athletes. Our medical teams were highly successful because we were committed to a common goal--providing service as efficiently as possible to all athletes. We knew that they had worked for years for just this moment and were entrusting a part of their moment to us.
<P>For the first five days, I worked at the Georgia World Congress Center for fencing and table tennis. Later, I moved to the massage clinic at the Olympic Village.
<P>At the events, massage therapists primarily administered pre-event massage. An athlete's muscles needed to be relaxed but ready to respond quickly and with strength. Pre-event massage takes about 15 minutes during the athlete's warm-up time. The strokes are fast-paced and consist primarily of compression, broad cross-fiber kneading, vibration techniques, and passive stretching. Pre-event massage helps athletes psychologically as well as physiologically. The feeling of being fully prepared can provide an edge when athletes are competing on the world-class level.
<P>I spent my last two days at the Sports Medicine Clinic in the athletes' village. Here, massage therapists administered primarily post-event and maintenance sports massage. Post-event massage can last 15 minutes to an hour. Its function is to calm the mind and to help bring about homeostasis in the body. Many athletes believe that post-event massage helps them return more quickly to training. 
<P>In fact, massage can also play a role in training. Maintenance techniques release restrictions and trigger points and allow the athlete to train more efficiently. Strokes are deep-tissue, which employ specific digital compression, myofascial release, and trigger point therapy.
<P>Though I had prepared long and hard for this opportunity to volunteer, I was still struck by the high-energy atmosphere at the Olympics. Everything was electric with excitement--and anxiety. So a calm and supportive manner was a must for all healthcare practitioners.
<P>Most of all, I'm left with memories of athletes who took the time to thank us, some with flowers, others with kisses. There was even one Russian who said I had "fingers of gold." I know our medical team made a difference, and that is what the Olympic experience is all about.

<H2>Ligament Sprains and Emotional Strains</H2>
<P><I>by Ronald Peyton, PT</I>
<IMG SRC="/biomech/sep96/peyton.jpg" WIDTH=82 HEIGHT=102 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Ronald Peyton, PT">
<P>The 1996 Atlanta Games was my third Olympics. I had been involved with the Mexico City and Montreal events, and I had helped set up the training facilities in Colorado Springs. But for me, this Olympics was special. I live in Atlanta, so this Olympics was more than at home--for me, it was coming home. 
<P>What an honor it was for me to be Coordinator of Sports Medicine Services for the Olympic Village. I had served with the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games as a liaison with the American Physical Therapy Association. When the time came for one physical therapist practitioner to head up Olympic Village services, there was no application. I was just selected. 
<P>The Olympic Village opened long before the Games began. Athletes began arriving just after the Fourth of July. For these world-class athletes, training is everything. And they know that in the U.S., medical care is superior to anywhere else in the world. And all of it was at their disposal--for free. Eyeglasses, dental care, all conceivable medical care and sports medicine--all free. So we didn't go hunting for patients, they found us. 
<P>I was exposed to some 300 patients daily. Supported by 20 other therapists and trainers, I worked 12-hour days. Our main job was not to suddenly correct with splints and braces. We tried to make people as functional as possible to participate. Participation was everything. So we used a lot of ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and ice. We cooled down the hot spots, such as a slight hamstring pull, and then stretched them back. 
<P>Dealing only with the world's best athletes, you have no other patients as motivated as these. It was a pleasure for a physical therapist, and indeed any clinician, to be around them. These guys and gals will follow whatever advice you provide because they take medical advice very seriously. 
<P>We never tell them not to play. Only their coach can do that. Sometimes you do wonder if they should press on, but for Olympic athletes discomfort is just part of the game. Debilitating pain is another thing. But there are certainly times when the forces of nature and human biomechanics make you stop. Those are the heartbreaking cases. 
<P>I will always remember one gymnast from an Eastern European nation. She had worked for four solid years and even won a world championship. Her only mission now was to bring home the gold. She was sure she had an excellent chance. But she blew a knee in practice. Actually, her knee was weak going in. Despite efforts, it just wasn't strong enough to withstand the punishment. She had one bad vault and landed the wrong way. The knee was torn. ACL repair surgery was necessary. She was out of the Games.
<P>It devastated her. She was thrown into extreme depression, crying, often to me. She was sorry she had let her country down. Not all nations view their athletes as we do in America. Understand, these people are national heroes back home, but only when they are winning. Once the gymnast was unable to participate, she was no longer "a contender." It was as if she no longer existed. In our country, she would have been on the front line watching as a hero. But from her country's perspective, her surgery was a disaster and a disappointment. She wasn't even allowed to attend key events after that, which she could have from her wheelchair. We offered to take her. It didn't happen.
<P>She wept and wept. It broke my heart to see. She was little more than a kid, a slight teenager. Her whole life was gymnastics. Her knee was repaired, and that will mend. But her emotional scars will last forever. No amount of rehab will take them away. And part of them will be with me, too.

<H2>How high do the stakes have to be to justify endangering an athlete's health?</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>The Atlanta Centennial Games were the biggest, boldest, brashest Olympic Games in history. By now, that description has become a clich&eacute;. We at <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> marveled at the human drama and tears of the athletes whose lives culminated in a dash for glory often no longer than a few moments. But we also marveled at the extraordinary network drafted from the biomechanics mainstream that worked their magic behind the scenes, and often not very far behind the scenes at that. 
<P>Thousands of volunteer medical and allied health practitioners, backed by state-of-the-art equipment, were there to support, help train, and help repair the athletes. We contacted six practitioners prior to the Games and asked them to send back their thoughts. The group was diverse--an orthopedic surgeon, a podiatrist, a physical therapist, a clinical athletic trainer, a chiropractor, and a massage therapist. The list included such established names as Donald Baxter, MD, immediate past president of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Surgeons, and newcomers such as Steve Horowitz, DC, the first chiropractor to be invited to serve the Olympics. Their experiences and commentaries are presented in our special coverage, <A HREF="/biomech/sep96/cover.html">The Olympic Medical Corps</A>.
<P>But I have a comment of my own. Some months ago, <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> published a series of outraged exchanges regarding an Atlanta doctor who injected a student athlete with cortisone and a local anesthetic to allow him to finish a key game with a sprained ankle. The consensus was that the boy should not have been allowed to finish the game--regardless of how important the stakes were. Yet during the Olympics, we saw case after case of injured, in-pain, or at-risk athletes repeatedly being thrown into the heat of intense competition--regardless of the consequences. They were braced, massaged, cooled, warmed, cajoled, enthused, romanced, and even berated because nothing mattered except the gold, and the stakes were that high.
<P>In the case of Kerri Strug, this magnificent champion was clearly injured and in pain before she embarked on her awe-inspiring gold victory. She winced in pain as she was carried away on a stretcher. Where was the team doctor? Why does the coach make the decision? I've asked about Kerri Strug's case and been told that a special case exists for the Olympics--the stakes are that high.
<P>Oh. Okay, let's see how high the stakes have to be. How about the World Series? How about a high school championship? How about the big game of the year with the pro scout in attendance? How big does it have to be to endanger the health and well-being of an athlete, to send a young woman in pain into a punishing physical routine? I'd like to hear from you.
<P>Then turn to this issue's <A HREF="/biomech/sep96/team.html">Team Diabetic</A>, where Melanie Sanders, MD, takes us to the opposite extreme of peripheral neuropathy, the painful extreme. Most of us think of peripheral neuropathy as an insensate condition. In her article, "Painful Peripheral Neuropathy," Dr. Sanders delves into why some cases result not in loss of sensation but painful stimulation.
<P>In this month's <A HREF="/biomech/sep96/oandp.html">O&#38;P</A> department, Karin Hollerbach, PhD, of Lawrence Livermore Labs, confronts the problem of 250,000 implant failures annually and how computerized prosthetic modeling techniques could reduce that number. Her research is just one example of how a defense facility is turning its spears into plowshares and prosthetics.
<P>If you need more controversy, check out our article on <A HREF="/biomech/sep96/custom.html">foam box casting</A>, by Sheldon Langer, DPM. You will recall the excoriation by Paul Scherer, DPM, of foam box casting. Now, a giant of the plaster casting world explains why it is possible and sometimes advisable to use foam plaster, and how to do so effectively.
<P>Welcome back from a summer of travel. Enjoy this issue.

<H1>Ankle Brace and Supports Source List</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>The biomechanics mainstream has focused considerable attention on ankle problems, both chronic and traumatic. The healthcare industry has responded with a virtual explosion of ankle braces and supports. There are so many new stirrups, wraps, and lace-ups that <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> is running its first Ankle Brace and Supports Source List. As with our knee source list, our compilation was drawn from manufacturers' descriptions of the technical features of their products and required to be devoid of superlatives or commercial content. These were then edited and submitted to our review panel. We did allow use of the word "comfort" to describe features, since these relate to compliance, but did not allow use of "comfortable," which we felt was a conclusion only a patient could make. Manufacturers were limited to three models and all suppliers--large and small--were treated equally.

</TABLE> 
<HR>
<P>More than 200,000 total joint replacement procedures are performed annually in the U.S. About 20 percent of these operations are costly and higher-risk revisions. Longer life expectancy and a more active population have led to more implant failures. Implant survival currently is 5 to 15 years, depending on the type of implant, the age and size of the individual, and the level of physical activity.
<P>Present techniques to test designs--cyclic mechanical testing and clinical trials--are expensive and have been unable to predict failures. These commonly fall into three categories: failure to reproduce normal joint kinematics (which alters limb function), material failure, and bone-implant interface failure.
<P>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has developed sophisticated 3-D nonlinear finite element analysis (3-D FEA) techniques to model material stress and predict failure in a number of complex applications. This technology has been applied to joint implants to predict clinically observed implant failures. In the past, finite-element analyses of prosthetic implant behavior tended to be two-dimensional (2-D) and linear. But orthopedic implant materials, especially polyethylene, have nonlinear stress-strain relationships. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) material failure is common near the articular surfaces. UHMWPE typically articulates with metal alloys such as cobalt-chrome or titanium. The resulting interaction frequently results in pitting, delamination, and scratching of the UHMWPE component. UHMPWE particles can lead to failure at the bone implant interface in the form of aseptic loosening, bone resorption in regions surrounding the implant, and peri-prosthetic bone fracture. Polyethylene wear occurs primarily in sub-surface regions, which cannot be adequately modeled in 2-D analyses. Of course, implants are three-dimensional objects and experience forces in all dimensions inside the patient. Consequently, 3-D FEA modeling tools can produce far more accurate results than 2-D linear analyses. In addition, corrosion and stem fracture contribute to material failures in prosthetic implants. These kinds of failures also can be predicted by 3-D FEA. Thus, 3-D FEA of implants is a better way to evaluate designs before they are manufactured or implanted.
<P>Improper articulation of prosthetic implants frequently leads to implant wear, bone fracture, and soft tissue deformation. To dramatically improve the success rate, computer analysis must become fully integrated into the design process. The failure of implants to reproduce normal joint kinematics often results from a lack of understanding of specific joint kinematics. Joint mechanics--including kinematics, muscle and joint reaction forces, and neuro-motor control--are complex and poorly understood, but must be included in implant design using computer models. Similarly, models to describe the characteristics of biological materials must be developed.
<P>Our team of physicians, engineers, and computer scientists already has developed kinematic and mechanical models of several human and prosthetic joints. In the early stages of modeling, it is important to choose joints where kinematic and mechanical data are available. For that reason, we have focused on the thumb carpo-metacarpal joint, where these human joint data are known, prosthetic joints are available, the materials used in implants have been characterized, and clinical outcomes of joint implant operations are available. The finite-element code used in this analysis is the NIKE3D code, a 3-D nonlinear code developed at Lawrence Livermore. Since the thumb carpo-metacarpal joint is used primarily in static loading, the simulations are run statically, although the code is capable of fully dynamic simulations. 
<P>Using a series of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans, we first developed a finite-element model of the human thumb carpo-metacarpal joint that includes accurate definitions of the bone and articular geometry, as well as a series of hypothetical ligamentous structures that model the net effect of the complex ligaments that surround the joint. Then we developed models of several implant designs. The designs were (1) a ball-and-socket style joint with a polyethylene socket and a CoCr ball and stem, (2) a ball-and-socket style joint with a titanium-backed polyethylene socket and a CoCr ball and stem, and (3) an asymmetric saddle-shaped joint, in which the metacarpal component consists of a titanium stem with a polyethylene articular surface and a CoCr trapezial component.
<P>The 3-D FEA's of these models show articular surface and sub-surface stress patterns when the implants are loaded with forces representative of common grasping modes (e.g., key pinch, tip pinch, and screwdriver grasps). These loads are static and eccentric to the joint components. Metal-backed and unbacked polyethylene socket models showed different stress patterns and levels of maximum stress. The stress analyses appear to correlate with the clinical observation that metal-backed sockets were more subject to polyethylene failure. Both ball-and-socket designs were also compared with the newer asymmetric saddle-shaped design. With similar eccentric loading, maximal stresses were fewest in the asymmetric implant. 
<P>In the carpo-metacarpal joint implants, regions of high stress calculations correlate with clinically observed dislocations and wear patterns. Key to the success of the simulations were obtaining accurate kinematic and mechanical data from experimental measurements, having nonlinear material models that adequately characterize the prosthetic materials, and having a fully 3-D nonlinear model that captures the significant features of the implant and the human joints. Accurate knowledge of joint kinematics and mechanics from other models has provided physiologically realistic data developing eccentric joint loading patterns and other simulation boundary conditions not always included in past simulations. The next generation in model development will include fully dynamic simulations and additional joints where dynamic behavior is far more significant than in the thumb. We are currently modeling the knee and other commonly injured lower extremity joints. Another technical challenge will be to combine the computer modeling processes for human joints and prosthetic joint implants to form a human-prosthetic system model that can describe the prosthetic-bone interface and accurately predict failure. This integrated approach ultimately should reduce the number of clinical failures. 
<P>We believe that 3-D FEA will play a key role in future orthopedic implant design. Our simulations already have proved the clinical applicability of finite-element analysis to biomechanical problems. The next challenge is to expand the range of applications of the modeling process and deliver the results to the biomechanics mainstream.
<P>As demands placed on the orthopedic industry by patients and healthcare providers grow, and as implants are required to perform at a higher level and to function longer, new design technologies are needed. Those most able to benefit from our modeling technologies will be the prosthetic designers of the future.

<H1>Correct Use of 
Foam Box Casting</H1>
<P><I>by Sheldon Langer, DPM</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>No single casting technique is always better than every other. For many patients, semi-weightbearing casting foam impressions provide a desirable model.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Editor's Note: In May, Dr. Paul R. Scherer's article, <A HREF="/biomech/may96/custom.html">"I Don't Want to Leave You With a Bad Impression,"</A> argued against foam boxes for custom orthoses. This article by Dr. Sheldon Langer offers the argument justifying foam box use.</FONT>

<P>The fabrication of functional and accommodative custom orthoses has focused on creating a device thermoformed over a non-weightbearing model of the foot made from a negative plaster cast that accurately captures the angular relationship of the forefoot to the rearfoot. This yields a neutral subtalar position cast with the forefoot fully loaded at the lateral column against the stable rearfoot. Thus, the practitioner provides a positive model of the foot in its most functional stable position. In other words, a neutral subtalar position negative plaster cast is one constructed by applying wet plaster splints to the foot while the subtalar joint is neither pronated nor supinated, and while a loading force is applied to the plantar surface of the fourth and fifth metatarsal heads in a dorsal direction, thus fully pronating the forefoot around its oblique midtarsal joint axis.
<P>This method of creating a negative cast is the most essential step when a foot orthosis, especially a functional orthosis, is to be fabricated. For many practitioners, this method, pioneered in the 1960s by Merton Root, DPM, is the dominant one. 
<P>However, don't lose sight of the fact that no single casting technique is universally and always better than every other. As a general rule, semi-weightbearing casting foam impressions provide a positive model with slightly wider heel and forefoot dimensions and possibly a lower arch contour for some feet if motion is available. For many patients, these contours may be desirable. Similarly, if practitioners or technicians lack fastidious casting techniques, foam impressions may be better than plaster cast.
<P>In addition, there are clinical reasons for considering the judicious use of foam casting. For example, in some instances a clinician may deem it appropriate to capture the feet with contours that are wider and/or longer than those obtained from non-weightbearing casts. Foam casting provides such contours without requiring the addition of plaster to the positive models. Yet this only generally approximates the expanded soft tissue contours seen in semi-weightbearing casts. Some sports participants do better in certain athletic activities when they use orthoses made from these "expanded" positives. High-impact jumpers, for example, could benefit because the lower, wider contours do not totally control or restrict subtalar and midtarsal joint pronation, a necessary component in shock absorption.
<P>Occasionally, geriatric patients with rigid or semirigid feet who do not require controlling orthoses--and who will receive accommodative orthoses--may be candidates for foam casting (semi-weightbearing). In such cases, when the patient also has plantar excrescences that the clinician wishes to balance or accommodate, the semi-weightbearing attitude of the foot in the casting foam often provides a better excrescence-locating mechanism than simply marking the area in a neutral-position, non-weightbearing cast. Why? Because some elongation or splay of the forefoot often takes place in these patients on weightbearing, which obviously would not be reflected in a non-weightbearing plaster cast.
<P>Equinus patients are notoriously poor candidates for full orthotic control. For them, orthoses made of semi-weightbearing casts from foam impressions may increase the wearability of the orthoses, since full control is often contraindicated.
<P>Moreover, some patients simply cannot tolerate orthoses made from non-weightbearing neutral subtalar position casts. There are many reasons why foot orthoses made from neutral-position, non-weightbearing casts are not well tolerated. Unfortunately, far too many articles concerning this occasional lack of tolerance are written by unknowledgeable or ill-informed authors or lay vendors seeking to increase the sale of their products. Nevertheless, let me state in the clearest terms possible: semi-weightbearing casts--generally not in neutral subtalar position--have their place when properly constructed, for the proper patient, for the proper therapeutic reason.
<P>Foam box casting is not the only semi-weightbearing casting technique. I used "puddle" casting in the '40s and '50s, but few would do this today. Essentially, the process consists of stepping into a puddle of wet plaster with cheesecloth on top, usually allowing the foot to spread and lower its contours. Oddly enough, when plaster splints became the method of choice, they often did not produce satisfactory casts because they either restricted the foot from expanding its contours or pulled away from the arch if wrapped too snugly. Indeed, that is a key reason casting foam in cardboard casting trays became popular. Neat, clean, and easy-to-use, foam boxes are nonetheless bulky, comparatively expensive, and frequently used improperly. Yet casting foam comes closest to emulating the results of puddle casting without the mess, time consumption, and high cost of shipping.
<P>Now, lest I be accused of abandoning my long-standing advocacy of neutral subtalar joint plaster casting techniques, I hasten to reaffirm that in most cases, plaster casting techniques should provide the most representative models of the feet in their most functional position (assuming that the patient is capable of functioning). Clearly, however, each case should be evaluated based on the same criteria of biomechanical management that you use for all your patients. 
<P>If you prefer to use casting foam, here are a few guidelines to follow:
<P>1. Do not allow the patient to impress the heel first and then the rest of the foot. This creates a uniformly poor impression.
<P>2. Place the entire plantar surface of the foot evenly on the foam impression material and apply at even downward pressure so that the entire foot impresses uniformly. This is best achieved by pushing down on the thigh at the knee while the patient is sitting in a chair.
<P>3. Since the forefoot has the largest surface area, it may resist impressing into the foam. You therefor should apply direct hand pressure to the dorsum of the midfoot to ensure a proper and complete impression including each toe.
<P>4. Be sure to note whether the foam cast is weightbearing or semi-weightbearing.
<P>Following the four guidelines above should enable you to provide a reasonably accurate representation of the foot when the positive model is poured.

<H1>Treating Heel Pain With Prefabricated Devices</H1>
<P><I>by Paul M. Taylor, DPM</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>When combined with other conservative treatment options, prefabricated devices may preclude more aggressive and expensive solutions to heel pain.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>Prefabricated devices for treating heel pain fall into four basic categories: heel pads, heel cups, molded foot orthoses, and removable braces or straps. As some are available in drug stores and sporting goods stores, your patients may have tried a few before coming to your office.
<P>A wide variety of prefabricated devices for treating heel pain is available. By themselves, these devices may not successfully resolve heel pain. However, in conjunction with other conservative treatment, prefabricated devices may preclude more aggressive treatment, such as cortisone injections or surgery, or more expensive treatment such as custom orthoses.

<BR><I>Silipos offers the Wonder-Cup and Wonder-Spur heel pads.</I>
</TABLE>

<H2>Heel Pads</H2>
Numerous types of pads are available, ranging in price from a few dollars to $30 or $40. Those available in drug stores tend to be very inexpensive and made of a soft urethane material. Since the foam is so soft, these pads tend to bottom out and are usually ineffective. In fact, it's not uncommon on an initial visit to see a patient who has tried placing two or three pads in a shoe to find relief. These store-bought heel pads frequently include the "doughnut" pad, which has a hole in the middle designed to relieve pressure on the painful area. They generally fail because the aperture itself causes a pistoning effect, pushing the soft tissue into the aperture and possibly causing further inflammation. 
<P>Spenco heel pads, available in stores, seem to work well. They are made of a closed cellular neoprene that does not bottom out. Sorbothane has been available for years and is effective. Many types of viscoelastic heel pads are available through various distributors, and practitioners should determine which types are most effective for their practice. More effective and very durable--but also more expensive--are heel pads made of silicone. They are available as a single durometer with a softer area in the center of the pad. Silicone products cost the patient $35 to $40.

<P>Hapad produces a heel pad of wool felt. Although not as high tech as silicone, it is effective and inexpensive. Since it is not possible for practitioners to keep all types of heel pads available in their office, they must experiment to find which ones work best in conjunction with other treatments.

<H2>Heel cups</H2>
Unlike heel pads, heel cups extend higher along the back and sides of the heel. This helps provide some stability to the heel and also prevents expansion of the plantar fat pad. One of the oldest heel cups is the M-F heel protector. It is made of a fairly firm plastic and does not provide much cushioning, but it does help to support the normal fat pad of the heel. The very popular Tuli's heel cup features a "waffle" configuration on the bottom to disperse pressure. Tuli's are available in athletic shoe and sporting goods stores.
<P> A number of companies have joined the market for heel cups, including 
<IMG SRC="/biomech/sep96/special.jpg" WIDTH=121 HEIGHT=153 ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Johnson & Johnson Specialist heel cup">
Johnson &#38; Johnson, which produces the Specialist line of products that include heel cups. Darco's distinctive approach features an acupressure heel cup with multiple small knobs underneath to stimulate healing. 
<IMG SRC="/biomech/sep96/darco.jpg" WIDTH=181 HEIGHT=115 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Darco's AccuPressure heel cups">
Although it's difficult to asses the effectiveness of the acupressure feature, these heel cups are very thin and can be used in dress shoes when other pads may be too bulky. The Stein molded foam heel cup is also light and thin and will fit in most shoes, including women's pumps. Since most heel pads and cups are inexpensive, it is easy for patients to obtain different types for different styles of shoes. Alimed's heel cups are actually heat moldable. This makes it more of a custom fit than a prefabricated device, and that difference is reflected in the cost, which is approximately $35 to the practitioner.


<H2>Prefabricated foot orthoses</H2>
Heel pads and heel cups are a simple, initial treatment for heel pain. However, most heel pain is not due to heel impact, but rather to a traction injury of the plantar fascia at its insertion into the plantar aspect of the calcaneus. Accepting this, another treatment option is a prefabricated, molded foot orthosis. These are readily available in a wide range of styles from most medical supply services and almost all orthotic laboratories. They are more expensive than heel pads and heel cups, with an average cost to the practitioner of $50; this translates to a cost to the patient of $70 to $100. Most can be customized to the patient. In addition to providing heel cushioning, they help reduce pronation and elongation of the arch, thereby reducing the traction of the plantar fascia. This is a reasonable option before proceeding to a more expensive plaster impression, custom-made orthotic device.
<P>Another type of prefabricated molded foot orthosis that is often forgotten is the leather or leather/rubber shell. Too often we think in terms of plastic or silicone, but leather devices--especially for heel pain--have been an effective treatment for a long time.

<H2>Braces and stirrups</H2>
Braces or straps the patient can reapply address the traction mechanism as a cause of heel pain and are an effective follow-up to taping the foot. A plantar fascia or low-Dye strapping is a very effective initial treatment for heel pain. If the tape strapping provides relief, it may be beneficial to follow with a strap patients can apply themselves. Taping is often limited due to skin irritation, but these straps do not require adhesive. One of the simplest is the Cout'R-Force Arch Brace, a nonelastic arch brace adjusted with Velcro straps. The PSC brace (Pronation Spring Control) is more complex, but in addition to supporting the arch it also wraps behind the heel, reinforcing the plantar fascia.
<P>Not all patients with heel pain require non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cortisone injections, custom orthotic devices, or extensive physical therapy. By carefully evaluating the patient and with proper selection of treatment options, a practitioner can establish an effective treatment plan using the prefabricated devices currently available. They can be used in conjunction with other modalities such as strapping, icing, restriction of activity, and stretching. If these treatments do not provide relief within a reasonable period of time, other options--NSAIDS, injections, custom orthotic devices, or physical therapy--can be initiated.

<H1>Bloch Orthotic Labs on the Scanning Edge</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>The industry's most successful adopter is Bloch Orthotic Labs. As such, Bloch is the only automation lab operating with numerous systems.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>The history of lab automation has been trailblazed by companies seeking to create networks of labs captive to one developer's technology. Multiple users would divide the costs and multiply the revenues for the developers. ADT was a prime example of that effort as it proliferated its Ortho Cam orthotic scanning and milling system to small existing labs or wannabe labs seeking push-button access to cost-effective custom orthotic fabrication. Essentially, automation allowed a lab to get into the business without a history of manual fabrication--or sometimes in spite of it. But the price for that technology was exclusivity.
<P>The economics were compelling. A small lab dependent upon one or two techs could be crippled if those two techs didn't show up for work or suddenly moved West. But computers don't take lunch breaks. At the same time, many doctors, pedorthists, and allied-health entities wanted to create their own fabrication capability for clinical and/or practice building reasons. Automation again was the answer.
<P>Bloch Orthotic Labs grew out of Bloch and Co., an Austin shoe store and certified pedorthic facility with a reputation among central Texas doctors for quality shoes for patients. In 1989, proprietor Jeff Bloch wanted to extend his stores' ability by adding prescribed therapeutic foot orthoses to shoes he sold. While Bloch didn't have the resources to become a national manual lab, he did have the resources to become a significant part of the automated orthotic industry.
<P>First, Bloch visited Cyberware at its California headquarters. Cyberware creates industrial-strength scanners used in Hollywood action films and by Bergmann, the Bergmann 2000 and 2001. But Bloch wasn't big enough for a Cyberware operation. After he left the Cyberware office, Bloch made a phone call from the airport. He discovered he was big enough for the fledgling ADT system (then known as ADE). ADT used a wand digitizer to take point measurements of the cast. Software created and managed the orthotic image, which was then transmitted to California for milling. In some cases, the device was milled at the lab's site. 
<P>Bloch signed up with ADT, and eventually fulfilled the vision of the automated orthotic lab. Lack of years of experience and customer base was compensated for with an extremely discounted product and aggressive national advertising. Indeed, Bloch became a focal point for discount automated orthoses. I was the first to call Bloch Orthotic Labs the "Kmart of orthotic labs." Ironically, that was exactly what Bloch's client base was looking for: discount devices quickly and accurately milled.
<P>Bloch was hampered by the obvious limitation, however, experienced by all ADT labs. Bloch's device was limited to functional polypro. So in 1992, Bloch installed an accommodative system that milled EVA orthoses that, depending upon the weight of the patient and the thickness of the appliance, could even be characterized as functional. Adding an accommodative capability truly set Bloch apart from the other ADT licensees. It meant that Bloch was not just an ADT outlet but a truly independent automated lab.
<P>In 1994, Bloch felt it had outgrown the ADT system. Under its former management, ADT had been wracked by licensee dissension and operational problems. Bloch brought in the Sharp Shape system, invented by the soft-spoken Alex Shang, Ph.D. Dr. Shang is no astute businessman, but he is considered a technology wizard. His CAD-CAM systems have been installed in several automated but unnetworked labs. "The milling quality [for Sharp Shape] was the same," says Bloch, adding, "the laser scanning was exceptional."
<P>The Sharp Shape allowed Bloch greater ability and latitude in functional devices, and made more economic sense. Economics is half of everything in orthotic automation. Quality is the other half. Because part of the promise of automation is cost containment or cost reduction, Sharp Shape allowed Bloch to retain its competitive edge. Bloch says his lab has now ceased using the ADT system altogether.
<P>Bloch still only utilizes polypro for its functional rigid orthoses. But, Bloch maintains, "For more flexibility, we can make the polypro thinner. Indeed, we can emulate any other product simply by milling thinner. We punch in the weight of patient, and then the rigidity the doctor requests. Our system cross-references the patient weight to the rigidity requested. Then we use 1-inch, 1.25- or 1.5-inch polypro to create the device." Bloch can waste as much as 75 percent of the original material to create the desired appliance. 
<P>Last year, Bloch again maintained the scanning edge in orthotic automation after a breakthrough agreement with Jason Kraus of Benefoot to open their architectures and become compatible. Benefoot sells the ScanCast 3-D scanner. Bloch knew his customers would soon be adopting office-based foot scanners. If they could use Benefoot's scanner to access Bloch's lab, the rules of orthotic automation would be rewritten. Bloch made the leap of faith, cooperating with competitor Benefoot. 
<P>It was not easy. Operational compatibility was months late and did not go online until summer. But Bloch's move opened the door for other labs to join Benefoot's open architecture movement. Bloch customers are now able to select Bloch's name from a menu on the Benefoot scanner. One day, a half dozen or more names may be listed, allowing practitioners far greater freedom in lab selection.
<P>Bloch is not stopping there. Again proving that his lab is completely independent, Bloch has just agreed with John Bergmann, DPM, to a second open architecture plan, <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> has learned exclusively. Bergmann's scanners are the most respected among the biomechanics professions for their power and attention to biomechanical detail. The new 2001 is said to be simple to use and priced to compete with the ScanCast. The winner here, however, is Bloch Labs, since it has enabled its customers to access automation easily with either of two major scanners. Therefore, Bloch Labs will be--for a brief time--the most accessible automated lab in the world, via foam box, plaster cast, and several of the leading office-based scanners.
<P>An ADT foot scanner is slated to appear soon. Unanswered is whether Bloch will link with that product as well.
<P>But Bloch Orthotic Labs can be expected to surprise people. By early next year, Bloch may be prepared to announce two major innovations that would affect both other laboratories and doctors.
<P>Will automation bring prices down further? Bloch believes not. "Automation costs money," he says. "Just when I was ready to lower prices because of the Shang system, my polypro went up. But at least I believe automation will allow labs to hold costs as other expenses rise."
<P>Bloch is currently producing more than 20,000 pairs of orthoses each year. He isn't determined to be the largest lab in America. But the most automated, that's another thing. Anyone who knows the affable Bloch knows he looks on computers as fun toys. Therefore, he is one of the few in the industry who wants to enjoy himself while pushing the envelope on orthotic automation.

<H1>Incremental Rigidity
in Orthotic Devices:
A Simple Approach</H1>

<P>At one time or another, most practitioners have found themselves caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place over the question of functional control versus accommodation. From the functional "purist's" point of view, obtaining mechanical control of a foot with a functional orthotic device of proper size, shape, and posting is a prime treatment objective. However, making a device too rigid or providing too much mechanical control in some instances can reduce a patient's ability to tolerate a device or even create new problems. Using materials in an incremental approach to orthotic rigidity may solve the problem. 
<P>Theoretically, one could expect optimal results with a maximally controlling orthotic device. But clinical experience has shown this is not always the case. Device intolerance can stem from compensations arising from long-standing biomechanical flaws. These conditions are characteristically difficult to functionally control. Other systemic conditions that make the foot more fragile include diabetes, osteoarthritis, or inflammatory arthridites. Whatever the cause, practitioners are confronted with the question: How much rigidity or functional control is enough?
<P>Clearly, a significant number of orthotic treatment failures due to patient intolerance are a result of improper diagnosis, measurement, casting, prescription, and/or fabrication. Nonetheless, some level of mechanical control may be necessary to restore a semblance of reasonable foot function. By combining various materials judiciously, an orthotic device may be "titrated" to a patient's particular clinical response. Most labs now couple levels of material flexibility and function. You can do the same in your own office if you self-fabricate or modify custom, functional devices through your lab of choice. Here are some recommendations.
<P>From the "purist's" functional point of view, start with a rigid or semirigid controlling device and reduce the rigidity or control according to need, clinical response, and patient tolerance. This relatively common approach can be achieved in several ways. The simplest way is to reduce the effects of posting or balancing. Shells can be heated and subsequently pronated, extrinsic posts can be reduced in degree, and rearfoot post motion can be increased, allowing more frontal plane motion. While this does not directly reduce material rigidity per se, the net effect is reduced rigidity. The heel cup depth can be reduced to decrease the frontal plane effect of the heel cup. The slope and extensions of the shell medially and/or laterally in the midtarsal region can be dropped to reduce midfoot support. 
<P>Another method of reducing device rigidity is to thin the materials by grinding them if dealing with polyelastic shells. This is not usually possible with acrylics because of their inherent brittleness. Softer top covers can also reduce the level of orthotic control by buffering the effect of the shell.
<P>Treatment can begin, however, with a more flexible, less controlling device and work up to the desired and tolerated level of control. The flexibility of the orthosis is a function of the plasticity of the orthotic shell material and its thickness. As the thickness of a material is increased, the rigidity also increases. Therefore, short of changing the shell material or thickness--which requires refabrication of the device--it is less practical to work on incremental rigidity by this method. Also recognize that polyelastic materials tend to have less than 100 percent memory. As such, the shell contours change with pressure and time--some more than others.
<P>The rigidity of the shell can be functionally changed by other means. The simplest method involves examining the length over which the orthotic shell can flex. The longer the distance, the greater the flexibility. The orthotic device can flex between two stable platforms. The proximal platform is the rearfoot post and the distal platform is the area where the device makes distal contact with the shoe. This is the front edge in an intrinsically posted device and the forefoot post in an extrinsically posted device. By shortening the distance between the proximal and distal platforms, the distance over which the shell can flex becomes shortened and the device gains additional rigidity. This is done with a non-corrective post. It may be termed non-corrective because most posts provide frontal plane control by a wedging effect, but this addition increases frontal plane control by reducing the shell sag. Filling the "dead space" between the distal edge of the device decreases the flex length. The longer the non-corrective post, the stiffer the device becomes. The stiffer the device, the greater the degree of frontal plane control. The fillers can be as simple as corex or as complicated as paste acrylic (i.e., methyl methacrolate). At the most extreme, the entire area under the arch can be filled with thermocork, soling crepe rubber/EVA, or materials of similar density. There are, however, two problems with this method: using filler materials may lessen contour compatibility and increase the bulk of the device, leaving too little room for the foot in the shoe. This may require more precise contour grinding in the plantar arch region so the plantar medial surface of the device fits snugly but not awkwardly against the inside liner of the shoe. Shoe distortion along the medial side of the shoe by the protruding device may be a problem.
<P>Rigidity can also be incrementally increased by lamination. Some prefab devices, such as the MBS, have "snap-on" laminates resting around the rearfoot post and under the arch, which can be applied and removed at will. Other thermoldable materials can also be heated and applied to the plantar surface of the device. Laminate materials include polyelastic plastics and stiffer fiber materials that either become adhesive when heated or can be glued to the device.
<P>The concept of modifying the orthosis via incremental rigidity may help make the orthosis more precisely address the patient's needs. Rather than working on the assumption that more functional control is always the way to go, practitioners should instead consider each patient's requirements individually and vary the rigidity of the orthotic devices accordingly. If anything will improve patient toleration and avoid creating new problems, it is such an approach.

<H1>3-D Motion Analysis
of the Foot and Ankle</H1>
<P><I>by Jeffrey E. Johnson, MD &#38; Gerald F. Harris, PhD</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>The MCW 3-D Foot and Ankle Motion Analysis System is advancing understanding of foot and ankle kinematics.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>The foot and ankle represent the final link in the human locomotor chain. Despite their critical role in ambulation, however, quantitative study of the foot and ankle is still in its infancy. Most of the research to date on disorders of the foot and ankle has focused on the clinical outcomes of various treatments. These subjective evaluations by clinicians regarding the efficacy of a given procedure or treatment offer little objective data for comparison across multiple studies. A tool that can objectively and reliably measure the three-dimensional (3-D) kinematics (motion) of the foot and ankle, however, would lend itself particularly well to the pre- and post-treatment evaluation of the same patient. A clinician using such a tool would be able to reproducibly measure the effects of various surgical or nonsurgical treatments and better understand pathological conditions.

<H2>Previous Motion Analysis Systems</H2>
In the past, dynamic foot and ankle motion observations have been obtained through methods such as instrumentation of cadaver specimens, stroboscopic photography, electrogoniometry, roentgen sterophotogrammetry, computed tomography, and high-speed cine and video of subjects during walking and running. More recently, computer-aided digitalization of whole-body video images has been used to objectively measure foot and ankle motion. While these studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of foot and ankle kinematics and provide a basis of our current models for dynamic foot and ankle motion, there are limitations.
<P>Cadaver studies only approximate ambulation because they are unloaded, infrequently loaded dynamically, or manually loaded in a constrained system without active muscle contraction. Studies of instrumented whole-body gait in human subjects during walking or running are limited because the foot and ankle complex is usually represented by a single rigid body, lacking individual mobile segments. As such, reporting is limited to only sagittal and transverse plane stance components, making it impossible to isolate which segments or joints of the foot are contributing to the motion. Other systems designed to focus on the complexities of foot and ankle motion have been limited to the study of ankle and hindfoot motion only and neglect crucial swing phase data.
<P>Early efforts to measure 3-D motion of the foot and ankle during the stance phase of gait, while useful, did not include swing phase data. Optimizing the clinical relevance and practicality of 3-D measurement required enhancement of these earlier attempts at 3-D analysis. The ideal foot and ankle system should capture both swing and stance phase data while being noninvasive. It could be implemented with reasonable accuracy using standard video technology, offer suitable rates of analog to digital conversion, display output in a clinically relevant format, and provide this analysis within a reasonable period.
<P>The MCW 3-D Foot and Ankle Motion Analysis System uses motion analysis technology to quantify 3-D foot and ankle motion during both stance and swing phases of gait. Developed for clinical application at the Orthopaedic Human Motion Laboratory at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), the system consists of six video cameras calibrated to acquire data from a capture volume <IMG SRC="/biomech/sep96/gait.jpg" WIDTH=209 HEIGHT=159 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Lab Data Capture Volume">tailored to the dimensions of the leg, foot, and ankle structures. The capture volume measures 2.4m (length) by 0.9m (width) by 0.62m (height) to allow full definition of the segment markers throughout one complete gait cycle (stance and swing phases one foot at a time). Infrared strobes synchronized to the camera shutter illuminate the retroreflective segment markers. The system includes a computer work station, two AMTI force plates, a 10-channel EMG system, and two foot switch channels (heel and toe placement) per foot.
<P>A calibration frame outlines the capture volume dimensions with an overall system accuracy of 98.9 percent and an overall resolution of 0.86 +/- 0.13 mm. During testing, a single footswitch is attached with tape to the plantar surface of the hallux of the instrumented foot to indicate toe-off. The force plate is monitored to determine heel strike. The video collection rate gathers images at 60 frames per second, with force plate and EMG data collection at 600 samples per second. Camera calibration, camera placement, lab temperature, linearization, and frequency of calibration are all critical factors in maintaining the accuracy and resolution of the system. Daily calibration takes about 45 minutes.
<P>A four-segment biomechanical model was developed for description of foot and ankle kinematics. <IMG SRC="/biomech/sep96/gait2.jpg" WIDTH=187 HEIGHT=154 ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Four Segment Rigid Body Model"> The model segments consisted of: 1) tibia/ fibula; 2) hindfoot; 3) forefoot; and 4) hallux. 
<P>Twelve retroreflective markers were placed on bony landmarks on the foot, ankle, and tibia to identify the four motion segments. <IMG SRC="/biomech/sep96/gait3.jpg" WIDTH=205 HEIGHT=159 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Marker Positions"> The markers are composed of 15.9 mm diameter nylon spheres, each covered with reflective tape and attached to a metal washer. A lightweight triad structure was constructed for attachment of markers to the hallux. A radiographic technique was developed to index the motion data with reference to bony foot landmarks. Antero-posterior, lateral, and modified coronal hindfoot alignment x-rays of the foot and ankle were used to provide these indexing measurements.

<H2>Normal Subject Kinematic Data</H2>
Averaged results from clinical trials of 15 normal adults were computed. The subjects were between 20 and 30 years of age and tested during a minimum of two trials per side. The results, which include sagittal, coronal, and transverse plane motions of the four modeled segments, yielded 12 motion graphs.<IMG SRC="/biomech/sep96/gait4.jpg" WIDTH=293 HEIGHT=221 ALIGN="RIGHT"> The mean motion is bracketed by one standard deviation in these graphs, which show data presented in the sequence captured. The convention of heel strike representing zero percent of the gait cycle is maintained. The abscissa on the plots is indexed at zero percent at heel strike. Tibia motion is reported with respect to the fixed (global) lab coordinate system. Motion of the other segments is reported as relative motion of the distal segment with respect to the next most proximal segment.

<H2>Hindfoot Motion-Coronal Plane</H2>
An illustrative example of the type of information obtained with the system is demonstrated by a review of coronal hindfoot motion. Motion of the hindfoot in the coronal plane <IMG SRC="/biomech/sep96/gait5a.jpg" WIDTH=173 HEIGHT=153 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Coronal Hindfoot Motion"> is defined as eversion when the hindfoot externally rotates with respect to the tibia (positive value) and inversion when the hindfoot moves in an internal rotation direction (negative value). The recorded motion pattern <IMG SRC="/biomech/sep96/gait5b.jpg" WIDTH=206 HEIGHT=152 ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Average Coronal Plane Hindfoot Motion">demonstrates an increase in hindfoot inversion at toe-off, which moves to neutral to slight eversion shortly before heel strike. Through most of stance phase, a relatively neutral position is maintained, with a movement back to inversion prior to toe-off. 
<P>There are several potential sources of error in our work, which can be reduced to acceptable levels with careful training and system calibration. The errors include marker location uncertainty, marker dropout, soft tissue movement, and radiographic measurement error. The four-segment rigid-body model of the foot and ankle estimates the complex motion patterns. Motion within the defined rigid-body model segments may also introduce error. Since the averaged data were determined from the analysis of motion patterns in 15 normal subjects, they should be considered preliminary. However, despite the lack of previous work that can be directly compared with this study, the patterns found appear to follow those generally reported in other studies.
<P>Certainly, interpretation of our system's clinical data requires an understanding of the specific assumptions and model conventions. For instance, we acknowledge that a larger sample size is necessary to increase confidence in describing "normal" kinematics of the foot and ankle. In examining the data curves, bear in mind that the motions (except for the tibia) are reported with respect to the next most proximal segment. The curve patterns and total ranges of motion are features of the data which may be of greatest value. As in whole-body gait studies, curve pattern analysis may represent a quantitative method for discriminating between normal and pathological motions.

<P>Despite limitations, advances in development of the MCW system may continue to advance our understanding of human foot and ankle motion. The system provides a tool for generating objective data about foot and ankle pathology to help the clinician better understand and treat pathomechanics. As clinical experience with these systems evolves, refinements undoubtedly will allow a more complete understanding of the practical applications of foot and ankle kinematics.

<H1>Painful Peripheral Neuropathy</H1>
<P><I>by Melanie Sanders, MD</I> 
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>It is still uncertain why some diabetic patients are insensate, and some
suffer from painful peripheral neuropathy. But treatment options are becoming more clear.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>

<HR>

The diabetic population is by far the largest group of patients suffering from neuropathic conditions, 
with reported prevalence as high as 50 percent in Type II diabetic patients over 60 years of age. 
Fortunately, our clinical awareness has also increased as the number of diabetics surviving the disease 
for several decades expands. Both the patient and the clinician must realize that nerve damage-not vascular 
disease-is the main cause of ulcers, delayed healing, deformity, and amputation in the neuropathic foot. 

<P>An ulcer on the plantar surface of the diabetic foot is often the first evidence of an advanced neuropathic 
process. If the pa- tient's diabetes has been stable, little thought may be given to the extremities and the 
preventive care necessary to protect the feet. Patients typically are unable to categorize the degree of 
change in numbness or balance and gait because it occurs so gradually. External examination of the foot 
often reveals no significant difference from visit to visit. Although neuropathy can affect the sweating 
pattern and elasticity and suppleness of the skin, these changes can be too subtle for the clinician to 
measure reliably.

<P>Among the group of patients with neuropathic feet, some will develop painful peripheral neuropathy (PPN). 
Professionals involved in the care of these individuals undoubtedly develop a great deal of respect for the 
degree of pain these patients endure and the difficulty in diagnosing and treating them effectively. It is 
a cruel irony that patients who eventually may have to live without any protective sensation must also endure 
years of pain. 

<P>Theoretically, pain and paresthesias occur due to spontaneous depolarization of newly regenerating nerve 
fibers, but it is not clear why some patients are so sensitive to these sensations while others are not.

<P>What are the characteristics of painful peripheral neuropathy? The patient usually will complain of a 
burning pain. It is not localized to a discrete area on the foot but rather encompasses a large area-usually 
the entire sole of the foot or all the toes. The pain is unaffected by the patient's shoes or activity level. 
Occasionally, a patient will complain specifically that the pain is worse in the evening or at night. The 
patients' attempts to find relief through local measures (such as massage or soaking) are generally 
unsuccessful. Sleep disturbances due to pain are fairly common.

<P>The response or lack of response to conservative interventions also must be explored. Changes to a 
cushioned shoe sole or accommodative inserts seldom appreciably affect the patient's symptoms. 
Anti-inflammatory medications rarely improve the condition either.

<P>If the patient's history leads the clinician to suspect painful peripheral neuropathy as the diagnosis, 
a physical examination is still essential. It is crucial to rule out any discrete cause of pain, including 
a plantar wart, Morton's neuroma, stress fracture, infection, or synovitis. These localized entities can 
cause atypical symptoms in the neuropathic patient. A careful assessment of the patient's foot structure is 
necessary to determine if the patient is at risk for stress-overload syndromes. They can lead to a very 
generalized metatarsalgia, which the patient can interpret as pain in the entire foot.

<P>In typical cases of PPN, a patient appears to have intractable pain without a mechanical cause and is 
unresponsive to the ordinary first line modalities of treatment. The patient may or may not be 
diabetic--although a history of diabetes should immediately trigger concern about neuropathy in this 
situation. If a peripheral neuropathy has not been diagnosed, referral for neurologic examination and 
electrodiagnostic studies is appropriate. Interestingly, it is not particularly unusual for the earliest 
stages of neuropathy to be painful. This means that the electrodiagnostic studies may be less than 
dramatic or even equivocal. Despite the lack of solid positive test results, treatment still should be 
pursued.

<P>Several modalities can be safely tried to control the symptoms of PPN. They can be categorized as 
either systemic (internal) or topical (external) treatments. The simplest way to begin treatment is with 
the topical cream capsaicin (Dolorac, Zostrix, Zostrix-HP). It is available over-the-counter in 0.025 
percent and 0.25 percent strengths; generic forms reportedly are not as effective. Neuropathic patients 
seldom experience the burning sensations that the cream sometimes causes in patients with normal sensation. 
Relief of symptoms often takes as long as four weeks, and then use of the cream must be continued.

<P>Oral medication is the next treatment to consider. Different classifications of medications can be tried 
and assessed. The first class to prescribe is usually an antidepressant-a tricyclic such as amitriptyline 
(Elavil). It can be started at a very low dose (10 mg) to reduce the major side effect of sedation. Response 
is variable, but the dosage can be increased weekly in low increments up to 150 mg if required. Patients 
usually appreciate the improvement they experience in their sleeping habits even if they do not see a 
significant pain reduction. Similar success has been observed with Pamelor (nortriptyline). If the patient 
does not tolerate this class of antidepressant, serotonin-uptake inhibitors can be prescribed (i.e., Prozac 
or Zoloft). Clinical experience with these drugs is not as extensive in neuropathy; however, they are better 
tolerated by many patients and occasionally provide dramatic improvement.

<P>Another class of medications to consider is antiepilitics, including Dilantin, Tegretol, and the newer 
drug, Neurontin. Tegretol, in particular, has a significant list of side effects and potentially severe 
reactions. Neurontin is not metabolized by the liver, is excreted by the kidney, and is well tolerated in 
clinical trials. It currently is being explored in applications that include neuropathic pain from shingles. 
The patient's family physician or a neurologist typically prescribes these medications.

<P>The next treatment to consider is an external nerve stimulator device. In the past, TENS units (transcutaneous 
electrical nerve stimulator) were not very successful because they could not adequately cover the large area 
involved with neuropathic conditions. TENS units were attached to small pads strategically placed in localized 
areas of pain. The recent development of a sock (Z-stim)-which can be attached to the TENS unit-allows a more 
generalized dispersal of the stimulation and a much broader area of coverage. The sock can be attached to either 
the standard TENS unit or to a Z-stim unit, depending upon the patient's response. Usually it is wise to prescribe 
a trial period of one to two weeks. If the response is good, a unit can be acquired for long-term use.

<P>Patients should wear optimal shoewear with soft and accommodative orthoses. Problem areas should be addressed 
in the insert; this may require custom fabrication to prevent breakdown and provide adequate pressure relief of 
vulnerable areas. Presumably, a patient who develops pain from the early stages of a peripheral neuropathy-due to 
a progressive disease such as diabetes-will have a higher likelihood of progression of the neuropathy as well. 
This will result in the previously mentioned serious sequelae we observe in the insensate foot.

<P>Fortunately, the number of patients who develop painful peripheral neuropathy is small. However, that number 
can be expected to grow steadily. Most diabetic patients eventually move out of the painful stage into true 
insensitivity-an improvement from the patient's point of view, despite the higher risk to the foot. This change 
in sensation can take from two to five years. PPN with other causes-such as chemical toxicity-may resolve when 
the offending element is removed. If no etiology is found, the condition may persist indefinitely. If the treatments 
outlined in this article fail to improve symptoms significantly, narcotic medications may be indicated. 

<P>Painful peripheral neuropathy remains a challenging problem in a small group of patients. Our treatment 
armamentarium is gradually expanding but remains very limited. Combinations of treatments are often necessary 
to provide any relief to these patients.

<H1>Running Start</H1>

<H2>Unsupervised tackle costly</H2>
A student's knee injury during a physical education class will cost a Florida school district $140,000 in damages. In his suit, the father of Keith Walsh claimed the incident occurred during a football game at school in which no protective gear was worn. The injury limited the teenager's potential for a baseball career, the suit claimed. Keith played varsity baseball at a high school in the Orlando area before graduating in 1995.
Medical costs were more than $5,000, Walsh said, and rehabilitation took six months. Keith missed two months of school. 
<P>Tackle football is against the rules in physical education classes at Lake Brantley High School, and teacher Cindy Frank said she allowed only a touch game. Her back was turned when the tackle occurred. The school's principal said that, in the future, students who play unauthorized tackle football will be disciplined more severely. 

<H2>Be strong and prosper</H2>
Tom Lunsford, CO, has released an essential book on orthotic and prosthetic materials entitled <CITE>Strength of Materials in Orthotic and Prosthetic Design</CITE>. Covering a range of materials from metal alloys to thermoplastics, the book reduces hard-core metallurgy and materials science to simple concepts with abundant, easy-to-understand graphs and illustrations. Lunsford's book can be obtained from Kendall/Hunt Publishing at (800) 772-9165. 

<H2>As the foot turns</H2>
A recent study published by the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society suggests that everyday walking motions under certain circumstances can be as stressful as running. Peter Cavanagh, Ph.D., a gait analysis expert, found foot turning while walking is five times more stressful than walking straight ahead. Such motions are a significant percentage of the ambulation typically undertaken in homes, offices, airplanes and other confined spaces. The greatest stress is placed on the hallux and may account for frequent occurrence of blisters, open sores, and fractures in diabetic patients, especially those with peripheral neuropathy. 
<P>The study provided identical oxford-style shoes to 12 healthy men between the ages of 20 and 33. The subjects performed 10 types of regular daily motions, including standing, fast walking, stair stepping, and turning while walking. Leather-soled shoes created pressures some 30 percent higher than even inexpensive running shoes, and higher even than unprotected bare feet. Dr. Cavanagh believes his research may help in the design of better diabetic shoes.

<H2>ABC's at new level</H2>
The American Board for Certification in Orthotics and Prosthetics has adopted new levels of credentials for O&#38;P professionals. The new certification procedures will allow registered associates and registered technicians to provide specified services under the direct supervision of an ABC-certified orthotist or prosthetist. Examinations for the new credential levels will begin next year. Candidates for registered technician status must demonstrate two years of qualified experience or complete a designated program to earn the suffix RTO, RTP, or RTPO. Full ABC certification itself has not changed. Practitioners must possess a BA and complete 1,900 hours of qualified experience and submit to other testing to be declared CO, CP, or CPO.

<H2>PFOLA keeps trying</H2>
The fledgling Prescription Foot Orthotic Lab Association is readying a certification process for its members. The organization of several dozen labs--from cramped garage operations to the nation's premier fabrication centers--will reportedly inspect sample devices, examine quality assurance manuals, and enforce mandatory on-site inspections. PFOLA, a good idea whose time has come, still has a lot wrong with it. Much of the heavy lifting and organizing is done by the smaller ragtag labs because the larger labs are too busy running their business. Also, the organization is still essentially a group of podiatric orthotic labs, many of whom fundamentally oppose the concept of a multispecialty approach to foot orthoses. A PFOLA official told <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> that its leaders' private views are kept out of PFOLA organizational activity, and that the body does not discriminate against non-podiatrist practitioners or non-podiatric labs.
<P>New certifying procedures will certainly add a degree of respectability to the group. But there is a question whether some of PFOLA's most active, albeit smaller, labs are willing to participate in their own decertification if they cannot pass the requirements. Those requirements have not been disclosed to <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>. The jury is still out on whether PFOLA will be a nameplate labs can proudly display or one that many practitioners will want to avoid.

<H2>Hapad to the rescue</H2>
The editor of a well-known biomechanics magazine has been suffering with the painful aftermath of an Achilles tendon injury suffered some years ago during a basketball game. A glimpse into his case was provided in the thinly veiled example of Eli, a medical journalist, in the July-August cover story on Achilles injuries by Mark Myerson, MD.
<P>Eager to get relief, the editor called Dr. Myerson, who recommended deep tissue massage, stretching, and a quarter-inch Hapad lift in the shoe of the affected leg. The editor had already been religiously stretching and massaging to no avail. But after just a few days, the Hapad made a major difference. The soft wool felt device could barely be detected in the shoe. The pain has now almost disappeared, although it flares up now and again, especially after sudden activity--such as dashing through an airport to catch a flight. Hapads are now regular features of all the editor's shoes, and the editor has become a Hapad convert.

<H1>War Victims Fund
</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Bombs and landmines have blasted away their feet and legs. Most are helpless women and children. The world, it seems, has forgotten them. Almost. 
But when no one else will help, the Leahy War Victims Fund and members of
        the O&#38;P community may step in.</B></I></FONT>

<HR>


<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Summer, 1972. Somewhere over the Plain of Jars.</B></FONT> 
U.S. Air Force bombs free fall more than six miles through rarefied atmosphere, past wispy clouds, and finally hit the Plain of Jars in Laos. The massive detonations ripple the Earth into vast craters and chasms. But one of the bombs does not explode. Instead, it lies beneath the material and soil debris, temporarily inert. But only temporarily.
The U.S. ran a half million such missions during a nine year period, not only bombing the Plain of Jars, but also dumping unused bombs there as U.S. planes returned from the air over North Viet Nam. 

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Spring, 1992. Somewhere in a field in Xieng Khoung province.</B></FONT>
The fertile Plain of Jars region is littered with thousands of unexploded cluster bomblets and other deadly ordnance. Much of it has settled into the ground. Despite this, Hmong villagers try to work the land. A small boy, call him Kim, discovers a 20-year-old war relic. He taps it with his toe. A terrible blast occurs. The bleeding child screams in pain that echoes through the field. His sisters come running only to discover that Kim has lost both his legs. He is hardly the only such victim of still active landmines and bombs. There will be hundreds of Kims before the problem is even partially solved.

<P>In 1993 alone, more than 120 Laotians--and probably far more--were either killed or injured by unexploded ordnance (UXO), according to a United States Agency for International Development (USAID) summary. Studies show that probably more than 40 percent of the dead and wounded were children. 
<P>In Southeast Asia, amputees suffer a life of hell. Medical treatment and rehabilitation is almost nonexistent. Not infrequently, bamboo is bound together and lashed to the residual limb to make a sort of peg leg. Those are the good cases. Sometimes these children strap an empty canon shell or chair leg to their stump and stuff it with rags--or the village carpenter may do it. More than a few of these unfortunate children spend their life tied to a square of plywood fitted with casters. In pain and humiliation, they try to exist in a world of rice paddies, dense rain forests, and foothills where physical dexterity is a requirement to survive.
<P>Terms such as ambulation and gait are irrelevant to the anguish and struggle these children endure to achieve the simplest mobility. The misery known throughout Laos, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and indeed all of Southeast Asia is part of a global testimonial to the durability of man's self-destructive power. The list of the world's bomb-strewn nations reads like an archive from the bloodiest coverage of the evening news: Laos, Viet Nam, Mozambique, Liberia, Sri Lanka, El Salvador, Afghanistan, Bosnia. In Viet Nam, after fighting the Chinese, the French, the U.S. and their own civil war, more than 200,000 lower amputees were counted. In 1994, the World Health Organization estimated more than 4,000 lower limb amputees in Croatia, Bosnia, and Herzegovina. About 2,000 of these are in the city of Mostar alone. More than 57,000 individuals have been killed in 13 years of ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka, and the amputee population now exceeds five figures. In Cambodia, the amputee rate is about 350 per 100,000 inhabitants.
<P>Wherever there is war, there are victims long after the war is over and combatants have laid down their weapons. More than likely, these victims can seek help from no one--not in their country nor anywhere else on earth. It is these most helpless of victims that the Leahy War Victims Fund and members of the international O&#38;P community are struggling to reach.

<H2>Only the Most Desperate</H2>
Some $5 million in war victim funds are made available annually through USAID. The purpose of the War Victims Fund (WVF) is not to help all war victims everywhere--that would be impossible. Rather it is to identify those who are completely without recourse. "We go after the unmet need," says WVF Project Director Lloyd Feinberg. "For example, we're not in Bosnia. Not because there isn't a need in Bosnia. There is, but the Germans and Italians are already there, and they have programs. Instead we are in such places as Cambodia, Viet Nam, Liberia, and Mozambique, reaching people who have no one else to turn to."
<IMG SRC="/biomech/oct96/wv4.jpg" WIDTH=273 HEIGHT=186 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>The program is administered mainly by NGOs (nongovernmental organizations), such as WorldVision, Save the Children, and Friends in Need Society. These groups submit proposals to USAID for prosthetic and orthotic help. Limited orthotic assistance also qualifies, USAID reasons, because war disrupts inoculations, allowing polio to spread.
<P>A beacon of help in this global effort is the Prosthetic Outreach Foundation (POF), founded by Ernest Burgess, MD, a Seattle orthopedic surgeon forced to retire at age 70 from two hospitals. Dr. Burgess is known for research that led to the Seattle Foot, the original energy-storing foot. USAID has partially funded POF efforts. In Hanoi, POF operates a state-of-the-art CAD-CAM facility employing Seattle Shapemaker software, the same software M+IND uses in America to produce prosthetic feet. Vietnamese technicians cast patients in plaster. Casts are then wand digitized at 6mm increments. A CAD-CAM carver creates a positive model which then goes to polypropylene thermoforming to create the socket.
<P>POF orders Natural Feet from M+IND, which ships them directly to Hanoi for dispensing. These essentially are the same Natural Feet the company provides to patients in the U.S., but with a slightly darker cosmesis. About 100 such feet are shipped and fitted each month, Dr. Burgess told <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>. M+IND provides the feet at a humanitarian discount. More than 6,000 such prostheses have been provided by the clinic since 1990, says Dr. Burgess. A Vietnamese patient can be fitted for the entire limb in a few hours at the POF's clinic. The total cost of each leg is about $190, and they are vast improvements over the wood carved and rubber 5-lb. devices commonly produced by other Vietnamese prosthetic workshops. The patient pays nothing. 
<P>Dr. Burgess told <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> that the power of CAD-CAM has enabled the Hanoi office to gather casts from provincial areas of the country for digitizing. Word goes out to all amputees in the area to assemble the day the POF team arrives in town. Casts are taken en masse. The casts are then sent to the Hanoi center for digitizing and sent to carving--usually 200 at a time. The finished prostheses are then delivered to the provinces for fitting. 
<P>Another WVF-financed group, Handicap International, offers a low-tech solution in Cambodia. A dozen workshops have opened where rudimentary prostheses are manually produced from local materials for as little as $12 for a BK and $20 for an AK. 
<P>In all, the WVF pays for more than 20,000 limbs annually through NGOs. USAID relies on several O&#38;P consultants to assess NGO requests and the level of need and benefit the American effort realistically can provide. It's hardly as simple as just providing limbs, says Don Cummings, CP, the Dallas-based prosthetist who serves as the WVF's lead consultant. "Sure, we are meeting the most immediate need and providing limbs," he says. "But more important is training and long-term sustainability." In many parts of Southeast Asia, a foot lasts only three months. "People in these countries work in rice paddies and other high moisture environments," explains Cummings. "That deteriorates the foot." Indeed, of 10,000 prostheses produced by Soviet technology from 1980 to 1990, only two percent survived more than three years.
<P>Mel Stills, CO, who has also worked as a key WVF consultant adds, "It makes little sense to provide legs and then leave. If the foot won't stand up to humidity and delaminates, the person will modify what is left. The anterior portion goes and they end up with a peg leg." 
<P>Feinberg and WVF practitioners argue passionately, "the real issue is sustainability. It's not just money, putting a limb on a war victim and walking away. We must establish a system that will provide continuing services."
<P>Training and developing of the sustainable infrastructure is now the key focus of the Fund, says Cummings. "The people need training in anatomy, basic biomechanics, and patient evaluation." Stills adds, "Who will repair and replace these limbs when we leave? When our funds are no longer available, who will provide long-term care? So they need an infrastructure. But how do you create and sustain that infrastructure? These countries don't have a sewer system, let alone the ability to import or manufacture prosthetic components."
<P>Hence, the emphasis is on developing an indigenous O&#38;P capability that works, howsoever primitive. In Nicaragua, that may mean wooden block limbs covered with rubber tire repair patches. "I know my colleagues may not agree, but in truth there's nothing wrong with a bamboo leg if it's applied by a person who understands the principles of biomechanics and prosthetics and adapts his local materials to that end," asserts Stills. 
<P>"It's a clich&eacute;," adds Cummings, "but it makes me appreciate our own country and resources. People often assume that if you're providing prostheses in these Third World circumstances, you don't have to provide as high quality a device. In fact, you must be a lot more creative. And it makes me aware of how creative other professionals have to be where they don't have the resources you and I take for granted in the United States."

<IMG SRC="/biomech/oct96/wv1.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=248 ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>"In Uganda, we're still trying to show people how to do proper amputations and then build their prostheses from indigenous materials--even if it's bicycle parts," adds U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont). Sen. Leahy is America's number one war victims advocate. In fact, Sen. Leahy created the War Victims Fund in 1989 after he visited Central America and saw the devastating effect landmines and other UXO had on children. The Fund officially has been renamed the Leahy War Victims Fund in tribute to the Senator's tireless efforts to help.
<P>Answering the moral challenge of developing an infrastructure, Sen. Leahy asserts, "True, these countries never had sewer systems, but they did have their arms and legs. That's the purpose of the Leahy War Victims Fund--to give them back their arms and legs with whatever infrastructure they do have."
<P>Creating that infrastructure may take a long time. Maybe decades. "Even the prostheses now being provided are substandard by western standards," observes Cummings. "Those fitting the prostheses have training only as technicians or fabricators, not in biomechanics. The tendency is to oversize everything simply because people there are not sensitive to an intimate, total contact device." Stills adds, "It's to the point where the socket is so large, the patient must use rags to wrap around the residual leg. It's never too tight. Just too large."

<P>Cummings explains, "When the socket does not provide total contact, weightbearing is reduced to the bony prominences, and patients get abrasions and calluses. Some patients even have an open-ended socket, resulting in chronic edema." 

<H2>Pure Altruism</H2>
Ironically, in supporting USAID's WVF, no professional benefits trickle down to the American O&#38;P community as they do with other healthcare aid efforts. For example, medical doctors in training and residence can help deliver desperately needed service and enhance their own training in the process. But that does not apply to the O&#38;P community since a minimum amount of experience plus certification is required to function appropriately. CAD-CAM operations--such as the POF's in Hanoi--add American-produced Natural Feet to locally carved polypro limbs, but M+IND is supplying them at a great discount to help the program.
<P>Absent any stimulus to the American O&#38;P community, the main benefit of the program is limited to one selfless focus: humanitarian. "For me, the ability to just do legs to help people without concern for reimbursement pencil pushers was its own reward," says Tim Staats, CPO, who has done overseas assessments for USAID. Staats has travelled to Ethiopia, Laos, and Cambodia for the program, and made more than a half dozen trips to Viet Nam. "I can't say my career in the United States benefitted in any way," attests Staats, "but my soul did. It made me feel good." Staats has served both as a pro bono volunteer and paid consultant.
<P>M+IND spokesman Dave Beck says his company sees its work with POF as fulfilling its mission statement: to provide the highest quality limb to anyone in the world at the lowest possible price.
<P>Sen. Leahy argues passionately, "We have moral responsibilities around the world. We constitute just five percent of the world's population," he continues, "yet we consume half the world's resources. The Leahy War Victims Fund is exactly the kind of foreign relations we need in such places as Mozambique, Angola, and Viet Nam. We spend a lot of money on foreign aid," says Sen. Leahy. "And many question: 'does it do any good?' We know this program directly helps people. And everywhere this program has gone--whether it is Viet Nam or Mozambique--there is a warm national welcome. We are helping."

<H2>The CAD-CAM Solution</H2>
CAD-CAM proponents such as Dr. Burgess and M+IND believe computers can provide short-term solutions that can quickly benefit hundreds of thousands. "Modular limbs can be produced using a fraction of the skills and resources, and by this simple system we can help so many people," Dr. Burgess told <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>. Beck says M+IND is prepared to go into any country with its system and says its capacity can produce 10 times as many Natural Feet for the program. As usual, CAD-CAM engenders skepticism.
<P>Electricity is too spotty to be reliable in many areas of need, such as Liberia, Cambodia, and Afghanistan, states a USAID report. "CAD-CAM links to U.S. fabricators would be fine for 3,000 prosthetic limbs during a brief emergency, such as an earthquake," says Stills. "But again, to service those prostheses after the CAD-CAM machines are gone requires local resources: doctors, materials, training, money. Where is that money? There's always money for guns and bullets, but not for prosthetics."
<P>Nonetheless, Dr. Burgess says the POF is hoping to extend the reach of CAD-CAM efforts to the Philippines and Thailand. Is anyone willing to wait decades before more widespread help is delivered? CAD-CAM advocates say they are ready now.

<H2>The Maiming Plague</H2>
But there is no one in the world helping war victims who believes any real progress can take place until millions of landmines and other UXO are disarmed, and until such weapons are banished from the earth. The numbers are impossible to believe. More than one hundred million landmines litter the earth's soil today, creating 25,000 annual victims. Every 15 minutes, someone somewhere steps on a landmine, according to Oxfam, which leads a global anti-landmine campaign.
<P>Some countries, such as Laos, tally millions just within their borders. But it would be wrong to think this plague is an affliction confined to the Third World. Just recently, long forgotten mines from World War I exploded in France. Last year, buried ordnance was discovered in a Washington, D.C. residential neighborhood.
<P>"Tragically," observes Sen. Leahy, "in a country such as Cambodia, prosthetics will become a major industry because, as one of their people has said, they are clearing their mines an arm and a leg at a time." Banishing landmines has been a personal crusade for Sen. Leahy. These horrific antipersonnel weapons can persevere decades after any conflict is resolved. 
<P>Those who think the primary victims of mines are solely men with rifles should think again. Nor are they confined to classic buried Claymore-style devices. In Afghanistan, Russian forces cold-bloodedly dropped bomblets shaped like toys and butterflies to purposely maim children who picked them up. Cluster bombs dropped over Viet Nam dispersed thousands of explosives into bushes and along rivers, waiting to be disturbed by farmers, women, and children. 
<P>Go ahead and disarm all the nuclear missile silos and weapons of mass destruction. Do that and then wonder how we clear millions of acres of tiny antipersonnel devices, many of which are undocumented, almost all of which are built to last. Militarists talk of deploying so-called "smart mines" in the future, that is, mines that can be deactivated remotely. Sen. Leahy counters, "I have yet to find a mine smart enough to detect the difference between a combatant and a child. Mines are the only weapon where the victim pulls the trigger."
<P>Sen. Leahy sponsored 1992 legislation to stop America from exporting any more mines, leaving that odious trade to China and former Soviet bloc countries such as Czechoslovakia and Hungary, among many others. Under the law, the United States will cease using landmines for a single year, 1999. "But we need to unilaterally stop the use of all mines," says Sen. Leahy. "Eventually we will get to that point."
<P>Sen. Leahy and the anti-mine movement were discouraged when the U.S. failed to sign an anti-mine treaty. Government sources tell <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> that Defense Secretary William Perry and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. John M. Shalikashvili were prepared to recommend signature, but too many field commanders objected that their options would be limited in the event of a hot regional war.

<H2>Future Demand for Volunteers Assured</H2>
It could be a half century before real progress is made developing the O&#38;P, surgical, biomechanical, and physical therapy infrastructures of war torn Third World nations. Until then, for as many years as it can USAID will need individuals from the biomechanics mainstream to discover something within them that compels volunteering for the program. "I met a highly paid orthopedic surgeon from San Francisco," recalls Sen. Leahy. "That is, he was highly paid. Today, he is earning $50 per month volunteering in the program and working harder than ever. But he says that in many ways his life has never been happier."
<P>Cummings adds, "What this program really needs is more volunteers from the American O&#38;P community. There are a few--very few--but we desperately need more." 
<P>Yet, thousands of practitioners volunteered for weeks to support the 1996 Olympics and Paralympics. "Volunteering means putting your professional life on hold," acknowledges Stills. "Many of us can devote two weeks to the Paralympics, but how many of us can do that for six months or more?"
<P>Sen. Leahy says, "It is up to the medical and health professions. They have to say: `We must do this.'"
<P>No need to make a quick decision. There will always be another chance, another killing field, another legacy of destruction. Future demand for war victim volunteers is assured. Death and destruction is a growth industry.

</CENTER>

<P>Who are the war victims of the world? And why are they of  concern to the biomechanics mainstream? War victims are the innocent noncombatants who are maimed by the conduct and often the aftermath of the conflict. Quite simply: they have gotten in the way, sometimes just by stepping on the wrong patch of ground. The slightest touch triggers unexploded and long forgotten aerial bombs and landmines. The blasts claim their legs in deadly testimony to the bloody power of man's weapons of personal destruction. Mankind has created hundreds of thousands of these victims across the planet. Who are they? Disproportionately, they are women and children. Their legs have been taken from them.
<P>Too often, warring nations have imported the best in killing devices, but have not yet developed even the least of prosthetic devices. So innocent children and their parents must hobble through challenging terrain with makeshift legs constructed of flare casings, bicycle parts, and bamboo. Or worse, they are lashed to a cart. Better is not available in their own country. But we are helping. Some 20,000 war victim amputees each year might go without proper prostheses were it not for the intervention of America's Leahy War Victims Fund and the efforts of members of the American O&#38;P and orthopedist communities. This month we tell the story of people we cannot see suffering agonies we cannot know because of wars we cannot fathom. Read the <A HREF="/biomech/oct96/cover.html">War Victims Fund</A> and find out what America is doing, and how you can help.
<P>The subject of amputation has been of particular concern to <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>. In our <A HREF="/biomech/oct96/team.html">Team Diabetic</A> section, Christopher Attinger, MD, details how his cross-specialty protocols have increased limb salvage success rates more than 80 percent in diabetic patients with renal failure. Dr. Attinger asserts, "This high rate is possible when diabetic patients with foot problems are seen by a diabetic foot team that includes a wound specialist, orthopedist, podiatrist, vascular surgeon, plastic surgeon, infectious disease specialist, endocrinologist, pedorthist, rehabilitation specialist, and hyperbarist. The medical community is gradually recognizing the benefit of such a specialized team approach."
<P><CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> has also just published its "Salute to the Paralympics," one of five specialty-specific reports. This one is for the O&#38;P community. The 36-page report illustrates in personal descriptions, technical assessments and dramatic photography the broken records and shattered dreams of thousands of Paralympic heroes who gathered in Atlanta two weeks after the able-bodied Summer Games. While this special issue circulated only to O&#38;P practitioners, the entire edition has been posted to two of <CITE>BioMechanics'</CITE> most popular web sites, the <A HREF="/biomech/OandP1.96">Prosthetics Home Page</A> and the <A HREF="/biomech/OandP1.96">O&#38;P Home Page</A>.
<P>Why the focus on amputations? Most in the biomechanics mainstream are occupied with improving lower extremity performance. They struggle to improve function, relieve pain, analyze gait, and provide comfort. But for many doctors, the issue is removing the appendage--or as little as possible--to save a life. What an awesome decision: life or limb. For still other practitioners, restoring or replacing mobility is the challenge. These practitioners combine their wizardry with modern technology to make biomechanical magic. For all these reasons and more, <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> will always include an emphasis on prosthetic research and advancement. 
<P>Enjoy this issue. We'll see you in Cincinnati at the annual meeting of the American Orthotic and Prosthetic Association.

<H1>Alignment of Custom Orthoses: FO to HKAFO</H1>
<P><I>by Alberto Esquenazi, MD and Mukul Talaty</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Gait analysis can be a valuable tool in ensuring optimal orthotic alignment.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>Overall function of a lower limb orthosis is defined by its ability--when necessary--to provide support, restrict motion, and decrease muscle activity without ever compromising walking safety and efficiency. To accomplish these goals, a custom orthosis must be properly designed and aligned. Design parameters are usually fixed once fabrication is complete, while alignment parameters allow flexibility when necessary.
<P>Whenever possible, optimal orthotic alignment should be closely established before the fabrication takes place because inappropriate component selection may result in increased overall orthotic weight, maintenance, and cost. Heuristics often are used to determine the prefabrication alignment, which can be achieved through changes in the geometrical relationship of the different orthotic components. Theoretically, each orthotic section should provide for multi-planar adjustment capabilities. The reality is different, however. With the Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO), only foot plantar/dorsi flexion can be adjusted if the device has an adjustable ankle joint. Foot inversion/eversion and tibial torsion are set at the time of fabrication. For the patient with a Knee Ankle Foot Orthosis (KAFO), knee angulation and foot posture can be adjusted. The line of reference commonly utilized in the sagittal plane for alignment purposes is the trochanter-knee-ankle (TKA) line as shown.
<IMG SRC="/biomech/oct96/leg.gif" WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=172 ALIGN="LEFT"> 
<P>This line is useful in determining the position of the knee or foot in reference to the hip or more specifically to the vertical line from the greater trochanter to the floor. A relationship is established in the sagittal plane when a line is drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the center of the ankle. These reference lines are useful in establishing alignment parameters for fabrication.
<P>Once a brace has been fabricated, further alignment must still take place to ensure optimal functionality. From a clinical perspective, optimal alignment is when residual motor function is used as efficiently as possible, yet undue stress to the joints and unsafe walking are avoided. After comfortable fit is attained, the alignment of the device is the most critical component in optimizing the interface between the patient and the appliance. Maximizing the patient's own functionality, residual muscle strength, and ROM, for example, only enhances the ultimate outcome.

<H2>Clinical Orthotic Alignment</H2>
Clinicians routinely use informal visual analysis of gait to dynamically align an orthosis. This type of analysis does not provide quantitative information and has many limitations due to the speed and complexity of human locomotion. Gait deviations and compensations present in the walking pattern of individuals who use orthotic devices further complicate the alignment methodology. A trial-and-error system traditionally is used to attain the best dynamic alignment of a brace. 
<P>Commonly, clinical observation and patient feedback are the primary sources of information on quality and appropriateness of orthotic alignment. With respect to these measures, joint position, range of motion, and/or other factors are continually adjusted until both the clinician and the patient are satisfied. For this approach to work, several factors must be consistently present: the clinician must have a keen biomechanical sense, the patient should be able to provide "good" feedback, and there should only be a unidirectional set of joints to adjust. Unfortunately, these conditions are not always present; nor are they the only factors to affect the alignment process. Even under ideal circumstances, alignment cannot be completely and accurately evaluated until the patient has had a chance to walk in and adjust to the orthosis. 
<P>To review, many factors complicate the administration of an optimal alignment. These include: speed and complexity of gait as well as the mechanical interaction between the orthosis and the body; the transient response to a new alignment that is followed by a unique combination of the many, though perhaps predictable, modes of neuromuscular compensation; psychological reaction to the brace; and the fact that current orthotic alignment methodology attempts to negotiate these complex and interrelated factors in a subjective manner. These factors all provide areas where the alignment process may be improved. Gait analysis provides the clinical team with the opportunity to infuse much-needed objectivity into the process. 

<H2>Gait Analysis</H2> 
Gait analysis can be used to evaluate more objectively the dynamic basis for an observed gait deviation in the patient requiring a lower limb orthosis.  It also can be a valuable tool in objectively assessing the impact of different orthotic interventions. Experienced clinicians can augment their biomechanical prescription process by using special quantitative and semi-quantitative assessment methods that include--in order of frequency of use--video recording (slow motion and instant replay), measurement of temporal and spatial parameters, and instrumented gait analysis (dynamic poly-EMG, kinematics, and kinetics). 
<P><B>Video Analysis.</B> While slow motion playback video allows clinicians to better perceive information that may be missed in real-time observation, the benefits of real-time graphic representation of the ground reaction force on subjects as they walk provide an even more powerful tool for analysis. The Moss Rehab laboratory is equipped with two large force platforms that, when combined with special hardware, permit real-time visualization of a force vector 3 <A HREF="#figure2">(Figure 2)</A>. 
<P>Since the spatial location and orientation of the line of action of the ground reaction force vector are preserved, video analysis provides an excellent visual estimate of the magnitude and polarity of stance-phase joint (especially ankle and knee) moments. Based on its semi-quantitative nature, simplicity, and lack of subject instrumentation, this information is of significant importance when attempting to optimize the biomechanical alignment of orthoses.
<P>Other more quantitative gait measures can be divided into the following categories: kinematics (temporal and spatial measures of footfall as well as motion analysis); kinetics (force analysis); and dynamic electromyography (analysis of muscle activity). 
<P><B>Kinematic Analyses.</B> Temporal-spatial footfall patterns are the end product of the total integrated locomotor movement. To characterize gait, basic variables concerning the temporal-spatial sequencing of stance and swing phases can be measured. These data can be obtained by measuring the distances and timing involved in the foot-floor contacts through foot switches or other event markers. Since motion reflects the summation of other factors and is in a sense the final output of the mechanisms (physiological, physical, neurological) that comprise gait, kinematic measures are useful for understanding what is happening and what the end result will be on the gait pattern of the underlying "problems." When a more detailed or focused look at the motion of gait is required, motion analysis is used. Segment orientation, velocities, and accelerations can be calculated. One of the most frequently used quantities in orthotic evaluation is the joint angle. Angles often are calculated for the pelvis, hip, knee, ankle, and foot to determine where motion deviates from established norms.
<P><B>Kinetic Analyses.</B> Force plates are a common means for gathering data on the forces involved in gait. This information may be used to compare against established normal patterns. The combination of kinematic variables with force plate data is used to generate additional data, including joint moments (indicators of how muscle groups are being taxed and how that may change) and joint powers (useful for assessing energy transfer through segments in an attempt to understand mechanical energy use/conservation patterns).
<P><B>Electromyographic Activation Patterns in Human Gait.</B> Due to the redundant relationship between muscles, there is no unique association between a particular movement and the pattern of muscle forces giving rise to that movement. In normal locomotion, the gravitational forces are carefully controlled by opposing muscular forces to yield a smooth and energy-efficient movement pattern.
<P>To assess patient EMG profiles, timing patterns obtained from patients can be compared with normative data to identify how the patient's electromyographic timing pattern deviates from the normal pattern. The patient wearing a lower limb brace will present altered patterns for affected muscles. <A HREF="#figure3">Figure 3</A> displays the comparative effects of orthotic alignment on EMG. These data were observed from a subject's vastus medialis with the brace in two alignment conditions that only differed by 5 degrees. Condition Two shows a marked reduction in activity as well as a delayed onset. For intact muscles or those with minimal involvement, normal control patterns with compensatory activation may be observed.
<P>Although clinical evaluation of orthotic alignment is routine, better ways to optimize alignment should be pursued. Instrumented gait analysis is an appropriate but complex and expensive procedure that can be used to evaluate more objectively the dynamic basis for an observed gait deviation in the patient requiring a lower limb orthosis. It can also be a valuable aid in objectively assessing the impact of different orthotic interventions. Unfortunately, the current state of clinical care and orthotic fitting only includes the routine use of visual evaluation of gait for orthotic alignment. Current research strives to determine such objective criteria.
<P>One such research project being conducted at the Gait &#38; Motion Analysis Laboratory at Moss Rehab aims to identify the effect of alignment changes in an AFO on lower extremity muscle demands. In this work, the immediate and post-accommodation lower extremity muscle responses to various different range of motion (alignment) conditions were measured. It was found that the response is time-dependent--a key finding because it necessitates an adjustment period before proper alignment may be gauged. Through statistical comparison of quantitatively processed data, changes in EMG not always noticeable through casual visual analysis were found from subtly different test conditions. It was determined that conventional rules--such as increasing the plantarflexion of a brace to reduce knee flexion and the knee flexion moment--do not necessarily hold for minor changes in the brace range of motion. In this case, changes on the order of 5 degrees to the total range of ankle motion were administered to the orthoses.
<P>To clarify and make the clinical alignment procedure more objective, it is not only necessary to continue refining existing methods based on readily obtainable data but also to forge ahead with research in other directions. The staggering complexity of human gait and the ubiquitous modes and levels of compensation associated with it mandate fundamental research in the area of alignment. The void in this scientific knowledge base fosters the current use of nonscientific, subjective methodology in clinical orthotic alignment. Our preliminary research suggests that clinicians and patients are better served when objective, quantifiable data that are simple to obtain and easy to analyze are available to assist in making rational treatment decisions.

<H1>MTSS: Evaluation and Management</H1>
<P><I>by Stephen Pribut, DPM</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Medial tibial stress syndrome responds well to custom orthoses, training modification and physical therapy.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>Over the past several years a refinement in the terminology and concept of shin splints has taken place. "Shin splints" has been replaced by the terms medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), compartment syndrome, and stress fracture. Previously, shin splints were thought to encompass many problems occurring in the lower leg. The general term "shin splints" was anatomically divided into anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral shin splints. Most athletes use the term shin splint to refer to pain occurring either in the anterior or medial portion of the leg.

<H2>Medial Shin Splints</H2>
Pain is usually present at the medial aspect of the leg, adjacent to the medial aspect of the tibia between 3 and 12 centimeters above the tip of the medial malleolus. Periostitis sometimes occurs in this location. The sore, inflamed structures usually include the posterior tibial tendon and muscle, but the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus can be involved as well.
<P>Stress fractures also can occur at the medial aspect of the tibia. The definitive test for stress fracture is a bone scan, but false negatives and positives can occur. A physical examination is necessary to differentiate between medial shin splints and stress fracture. In MTSS patients, the tenderness extends along a considerable vertical distance of the tibia. If a stress fracture is present, however, tenderness usually extends horizontally across the front of the tibia.
<P>Athletes at any level can be slowed down by MTSS and those with a mechanical predisposition toward it can achieve a higher success rate if treatment is followed up with custom foot orthoses. Experienced runners and elite athletes with MTSS usually exhibit significant subtalar joint pronation. But in my experience athletes usually are able to return to a high level of training quickly after controlling the abnormal pronation with custom orthoses.
<P>It takes an integrated approach to control the causes of MTSS to prevent chronic recurrence.

<H2>Runners At Risk for MTSS</H2>
Both beginning and experienced runners are susceptible to MTSS. The beginning runner usually has not acclimated to the stresses of running and frequently does not stretch enough. Poor choice of shoes and surface (e.g., concrete) also can play a role. Although the most common mechanical risk factor is pronation of the subtalar joint, over-training remains a major factor. The posterior muscles may be both too tight and too strong. A gastro-soleus equinous will cause increased pronation as a compensatory mechanism; therefore, proper stretching is important. Beginning runners usually respond well to a decrease in running, improved shoes, and acclimatization to exercise; custom orthoses may be used if symptoms do not resolve.
<P>A second group of vulnerable athletes constitutes experienced runners and includes high school athletes returning to exercise after a layoff. Significant pronation of the subtalar joint almost always occurs in this group. Running on a canted surface, such as the side of a crowned road, can put the higher leg at risk to develop this problem, due to the greater pronation this foot  exhibits. The proximate cause of MTSS is overtraining in both groups of athletes. A thorough evaluation should be made of the patient's training and racing schedule, and sports shoes. Biomechanical risk factors also must be thoroughly evaluated.
<P>Training should be decreased immediately for patients experiencing MTSS. They should be advised not to run if pain occurs during or following the run. Non-weightbearing exercise may be necessary and alternative exercises--including swimming, biking, and pool running--should be used to maintain fitness. Although running on soft surfaces has been recommended for this type of pain, that is not likely to help a patient with a pure MTSS. Since the foot is more likely to pronate excessively on soft grass or sand, packed dirt is an ideal surface. Running on concrete should always be avoided. While ice applications following running may provide some relief, they are not curative. Adjunctive measures include physical therapy modalities such as electrical stimulation, ultrasound, and taping the foot to limit pronation and decrease the stress on the medial structures of the leg. Anti-inflammatory medication also can be prescribed. But this approach offers only short-term relief, and motion control shoes and custom orthoses are highly recommended to provide continuing protection against the abnormal pronation that is usually the major contributing factor to this  syndrome. 

<H2>Orthoses and MTSS</H2>
A variety of materials and casting methods can be used to treat MTSS. Orthotic laboratories can help practitioners decide which materials will work best for their patients, as casting techniques must be impeccable to obtain best results. Many times, there is a significant component of forefoot varus in those exhibiting MTSS. When producing an off-weightbearing cast, note whether a flexible plantar flexed first ray is present. Personally, I like to slightly reduce the prominence of this when casting while remaining careful not to supinate the mid-tarsal joint. I frequently use extrinsic posting in the rearfoot and forefoot, although it is more bulky than intrinsic posting. An orthosis for this condition should have some degree of flexibility and shock absorption, but it must not be so flexible that the patient will pronate through the device. 
<P>MTSS responds well to training modification, the use of optimally designed sports shoes, and physical therapy. Oral anti-inflammatory medications also can be prescribed, and chronic problems require the ongoing use of custom foot orthoses. Avoiding problems in the future can be achieved by judiciously implementing a carefully crafted training and racing schedule. Prompt and appropriate intervention should make these problems easily treatable with a high rate of success.

<H1>Prefabricated Orthoses Source List</H1>

</CENTER>

<P>The spectrum of prefabricated foot orthoses continues to broaden. Since our first source list a year ago, more products have been added. Now, even more options exist, from short-term premolded comfort devices to highly engineered customizables that are the mainstay of a well-thought-out therapy program. The choice of materials is extraordinary, including everything from the water-reactive resinous Biothotic to the viscoelastic Viscoped-E. Methods of fabrication include a host of high-tech and low-tech technologies, from water-injected resin direct molding, to computerized fabrication, to old-fashioned toaster thermolding. Even we at <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> have a hard time keeping track of the many models and their constant updates. This year's list again relies on submissions from manufacturers screened, augmented, and edited for accuracy and to subtract exaggeration or superlatives. We are still excluding unmolded insoles, but this year we have added some of the more popular highly molded replacement insoles dispensed by practitioners as orthotic therapy.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Few know his name, but many practitioners have benefitted from his systems. Alex Shang, PhD, is a quiet but very real factor in orthotic automation.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>This year, approximately 60,000 custom foot orthoses will be expertly fabricated using an automated CAD-CAM system few doctors know exists. The system generally is not deployed in labs that openly promote themselves                as "automated," such as Piedmont and Bergmann. Rather, it can be found behind the scenes in old-line custom labs that use CAD-CAM as a manufacturing efficiency, not a selling point. Moreover, you probably won't see advertising or flashy press releases from the company behind this system. Despite its low profile, Sharp Shape, an unincorporated company operated by the shy and quiet Alex Shang, PhD, has made an unmistakable impact on the field of orthotic automation. His name and system are known by virtually every lab that has considered a CAD-CAM system. And within a few months, he plans to introduce an office-based foot scanner for general practitioner use.
<P>Dr. Shang can be called a genuine pioneer in the orthotic automation field. In 1990, he moved from his native Beijing to Arizona, where he joined a NASA project at Arizona State University. When the project lost funding, Dr. Shang answered a newspaper ad to join the ill-fated Ammon system, which many thought might become a standard in the industry. Dr. Shang was a principal developer of the system, years before many thought foot scanning was possible. After Ammon went bankrupt, Dr. Shang set off on his own to engineer industrial-strength orthotic scanning and fabricating systems for orthotic labs. Shunning hype and claims of grandeur, Dr. Shang did not try to establish a profitable network of labs or corner clients into royalty agreements filled with small print. Instead, the soft-spoken Dr. Shang sought only to sell his handcrafted technology to one client at a time. The price: $35,000 per copy. 
<P>The Shang system is not called the Razzle Dazzle 9000 or OrthoGalactic II but goes by the sleep-inducing name of Automated Orthotic Manufacturing System (AOMS). What the AOMS lacks in logo savvy, however, it makes up in pure orthotic wizardry. It is impressive enough to be used by mainline perfectionists such as Allied OSI, Burns, Foot Management, ProLab, and Solo. These labs don't advertise themselves as automated labs, so they have adopted Sharp Shape technology as part of their custom fabrication philosophy. The sixth Shang user is Bloch, which does trade on its CAD-CAM capability (<CITE>Bloch Orthotics--On the Scanning Edge</CITE>, September 1996). Two more companies have nearly committed to Sharp Shape. Dr. Shang declined to identify them for the record, but <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> has learned their names: one is a multispecial lab and one manufactures for a consumer-oriented company. The lab-based Shang system has even been recommended by at least one competing automated source when a buyer wanted on-site milling.
<H2>The Direct Approach</H2>
Dr. Shang personally developed Sharp Shape technology. It includes an in-lab laser scanner, software to realize and correct according to the lab's orthotic approach, and a miller interface custom-engineered to each client's specifications. The Shang system excludes the miller, which any lab can acquire for between $35,000 and $100,000. Once the miller is connected, the Shang system allows direct milling; that is, the milling machine can carve the top and bottom of the appliance out of a larger sheet or block of semirigid plastic. Characteristic milling striations are left by the drill bit.
<P>Dr. Shang did not know it when he independently developed his system, but direct milling may technically infringe the patent rights of ADT, according to Sharp Shape and sources at ADT. It would take a lot of lawyers, more money than anyone wants to spend, and a few years of aggravating litigation for a court to decide. A thicket of ADT-related litigation in the automated orthotic field has already wasted enormous resources, and nobody needs any more of it. Moreover, a decision on the enforceability of ADT's patent could go either way. The issue is fundamentally moot, however, since Shang sites that <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> contacted use the AOMS system not to mill directly but to create a three-dimensional positive intermediary which then becomes the basis for thermoforming the ultimate device. One lab source said, "I don't want direct milling because I can't get the control I need. That's why I go to the positive." Creating an intermediary avoids the patent question.

<H2>Foot Scanner Ahead</H2>
Sharp Shape is now taking the next step, creating an inexpensive office-based foot scanner that would be compatible with the six or more labs using the AOMS system. Shang's new scanner openly concedes certain limitations. It only captures a non-weightbearing or semi-weightbearing plantar view through a flat, clear platform. The patient's foot is pressed against what looks like a photocopier plate for a single-line laser scan. Indeed, the process resembles photocopying the foot. Two units are now being tested. Dr. Shang declined to identify where, but <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> has learned that Allied OSI and ProLab are the test sites. The new  scanner "is only the second accurate scanner to allow proper cast correction techniques," says Dr. Paul Scherer, owner of ProLab. Tests are going well, sources say, and Dr. Shang hopes to mass market his scanner to all biomechanical professions for $5,000 per unit.
<P>Dr. Shang claims that although he has no mass marketing experience, he is prepared to compete toe-to-toe with the other scanner manufacturers. That, of course, is easier said than done. Start with the name. For example, Benefoot's scanner is the ScanCast 3D. Bergmann's is the Bergmann 2001. ADT's scanner will be called the BioScan. Those are catchy names. Shang's new scanner will be called the 3D Dual Laser Foot Scanner. I'm drowsy already. A catchier name, say, the "Sharp Shape," would avoid confusion with Benefoot's product and create a clearer brand identity. The idea is free for the taking, Dr. Shang.
<P>Developers traditionally have lacked the flare and pizzazz necessary to capture the fascination and confidence of detached buyers. Marketing savvy is crucial in the foot scanner business. Foot scanners require a proliferated installed base to make sense. Technology without marketing is like a tree falling in a forest with no one to see it. But by whatever name and at whatever success level, the entry of the "Sharp Shape" foot scanner early next year will add diversity to the expanding market.

<H1>Preventing
Materials Failure</H1>
<P><I>by Tom Lunsford, CO</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Understanding how properties such as stress, strength and fatigue affect an orthosis is crucial to its effective design.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>The failure of orthotic materials puts a hard stop on any therapeutic effort. Understanding and preventing the dynamics that cause failure is a primary challenge for every practitioner who fabricates or prescribes. Although the properties of thermoplastics and metal alloys relied upon for orthoses seem profoundly different, they abide by some of the same rules of stress, strength, and fatigue.
<P>The range of elasticity, the yield, and ultimate stress points are high enough in most metals to prevent orthotic failure. Fatigue stresses, which are the result of repeatedly applied small loads rather than application of a large load, are the main cause of breakage. Such stresses can be partially compared with the physiological stresses to which a normal individual is subjected in walking. When a man is walking, the effort required for each step is only a fraction of his available energy. However, he soon reaches a point where even the relatively small expenditure of energy necessary for lifting his limbs just requires too much effort.
<P>Fatigue stresses are fluctuating stresses of a magnitude less than the ultimate stress of the material. While the ultimate stress would cause breakage immediately, fatigue stress causes failure after a number of cycles. In physiological stress, if the man rests for a period, the fatigue will lessen or be completely alleviated. However, in orthotic materials, rest from fatigue stressing the material will have no effect on the number of cycles before breakage occurs.
<P>By plotting the stresses on a material against the number of 
<IMG SRC="/biomech/oct96/mat1.gif" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 ALIGN=LEFT>
applications of such stress prior to breakage, the curves in Figure 1 are obtained. In the case of steel, repeated stresses below a certain level will not cause fatigue failure. The steel curve levels off at a value of approximately 50 percent of its ultimate stress. Theoretically, this is the fatigue strength of the material, and any number of stresses at or below this level of 70,000 psi will not be expected to cause fatigue failure.
<P>Aluminum curves are quite different. Aluminum does not level off as steel does and is therefore more subject to fatigue failure. Although the addition of alloying elements raises the ultimate strength and yield point, it does not appreciably change the fatigue strength. Table 1 illustrates 
<IMG SRC="/biomech/oct96/mat2.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=122 ALIGN=RIGHT>
this point. Heat treatment also has only a small effect on aluminum fatigue.
<P>The aluminum sidebars on orthotic knee joints frequently fracture near the joint if the patient exhibits cyclic medio-lateral motion (stresses). In addition, extended stirrup tongues prematurely fracture transversely at cyclic loads well below the ultimate strength.

<H2>Stress Concentration</H2>
The average value of stress on a given object is obtained by dividing the amount of applied force by the size of the resisting area. However, if there are nicks, notches, drilled holes, sharply bent corners, name stampings, and so forth, the stress will be concentrated at these points, and values may be several times the average stress. This increased stress lowers the resistance of the material to impact and fatigue loadings and is an important contributing factor in orthotic failures. It is easiest to see the effect of stress concentrations on a brittle material such as glass.
<P>Example: A man wants to break a piece of glass in half. If he simply applies force to both ends and bends the glass, it will shatter into a mass of splinters. However, if he scribes a line on the surface of the glass with a glazer's cutter and then applies bending forces, the glass will be neatly broken into two parts. The material will be stressed the highest at the scribed line, concentrating the applied force at that location.
<P>Although the effect of stress concentration on ductile materials, including some metals, is not as dramatic as with brittle materials, the same phenomenon occurs. With this in mind it is possible to minimize the points of stress concentration and increase the strength of the material. This is done in orthoses by using certain fabrication procedures that minimize stress.
<P>Using contouring instruments on metallic parts creates significant stress risers. A single transverse scratch or groove can multiply the applied stress by a factor of 10, which can yield catastrophic results. Transverse grinding or sanding of metal stirrups can greatly reduce service life. Holes drilled in stirrups also multiply the applied stance phase stresses, causing premature failure.
<P>Using a cast saw to remove a vaccum-formed thermoplastic from a plaster cast can create scratches in the edge of the plastic. Edge scratches can initiate catastrophic fractures of the more rigid plastics, e.g., polypropylene.

<H2>Minimizing Stress Concentration</H2>
The following recommendations will help to minimize the points of stress concentration and thereby increase the strength of the orthosis.
<UL>1. Remove nicks and scratches from the material by sanding and then polishing. (Here is an instance where material is removed to distribute the stress equally and thereby straighten the material.)</UL>
<UL>2. Cap the checkered jaws of the vise before clamping.</UL>
<UL>3. Make sure that contouring instruments have smooth, curved surfaces. Also, remove contouring marks by sanding and then polishing.</UL> 
<UL>4. Do not shape the orthosis stirrups with a metal hammer.</UL>
<UL>5. Avoid abrupt changes in cross-section. When two sections are being joined together, the stress may be concentrated on the joint area depending 
<IMG SRC="/biomech/oct96/mat3.gif" WIDTH=235 HEIGHT=136 ALIGN=RIGHT>
upon the type of joint, e.g., Figure 2a. However, if extra material is added to form a fillet as in Figure 2b, the stress concentration will be minimized.</UL>
<UL>6. Avoid drilling holes in high-stress areas (e.g., the base of a long-tongue metal stirrup or near the sagittal walls of a plastic AFO).</UL>

<H2>Shape of Orthotic Parts</H2>
<IMG SRC="/biomech/oct96/mat4.jpg" WIDTH=118 HEIGHT=235 ALIGN=LEFT>
Many orthopedic parts act in the same manner as beams. The upper sidebars of an orthosis are subjected to lateral forces, causing bending stresses (Figure 3). Bending stresses on a member acting as a beam are not the same as pure tension, compression, or shear stresses, where the strain depends on the amount of the area and not on the shape of the cross-sectional area of the member.
<P>In the case of a beam, the top fibers of the beam are in maximal compression while the bottom side is in maximum tension (Figure 4a). The 
stresses are in opposite directions and decrease towards the center of the area (Figure 4b). In this location, called the neutral axis, the stress is zero. Distributing as much material as possible away from the neutral axis will lower the stress and therefore lower the resulting strain on the member.
<IMG SRC="/biomech/oct96/mat5.jpg" WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=285 ALIGN=RIGHT>

<P>It is possible and advisable to distribute the same amount of material in different shapes to lower stresses. The familiar shape of a structural "I" beam illustrates this principle. Instead of using rectangular cross-sections, these beams are made in the shape of an "I." The material in the rectangular beam is removed from the sides and placed on the top and bottom. The rigidity of the beam is thus increased with reference to bending in this direction. However, resistance to bending about the sides will be diminished. Proper design considers the anticipated direction of maximum bending and orients the structural member accordingly. Remember, the more flexible a member is, the more likely it will fail prematurely. 

<H2>Orthotic Designs</H2> 
In fabricating an orthosis, the orthotist positions the sidebars of a lower-limb orthosis having rectangular cross-sectional areas so that the long dimension of the rectangle is parallel to the anterior-posterior direction. In this position, the bars are able to resist larger forces and are more rigid than in the medio-lateral direction. This design and the attachment of cuffs are correct if the maximum anticipated forces are generated by a knee lock preventing flexion where increased rigidity is desirable with reference to medio-lateral bending moments.
<P>Where the direction of maximum stress is not known, the material should be distributed in the form of a ring. The ring shape resists bending in all directions equally well.
<P>When there are significant moments in two directions, and one is known to be larger than the other, tubular areas can be used to obtain effective resistance to bending. The contouring of tubular cross-sections is somewhat difficult. An example with orthoses is the case of a heavy individual who is bow-legged and therefore has large medio-lateral bending moments and anterior-posterior bending moments as well.
<P>Incorporating these basic principles into orthotic designs to postpone and avoid orthotic failure should be a real goal of every practitioner fabricating an orthosis that is expected to last.
