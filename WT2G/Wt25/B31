Thirty-one area businesses will offer samples of such yummy chocolate treats as fudge, mousse, cake and coffee from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. today at East Towne Mall. If you bring the children, they can enjoy face painting, cookie decorating and chocolate eating. Tickets are $10 a person, whether you&#39;re a grown-up or a child, and available at the East Towne registration desk. The money goes to the National Kidney Foundation of East Tennessee to help people in our area who are battling kidney disease. Get there early before everybody eats all the fudge!
<P>
<P>2.If you know the name &#39;&#39;Meadowlark Lemon,&#39;&#39; you need no introduction to the Harlem Globetrotters. If your children ask if Meadowlark Lemon is a new soft drink, you need to educate them in a hurry. After all, the Globetrotters are the team that was executing behind-the-back passes and glides to the basket long before they became National Basketball Association standards. Of course, Meadowlark isn&#39;t on the Globetrotters&#39; court these days, but the Globetrotters of today are coming to the University of Tennessee&#39;s Thompson Boling Arena at 7:30 p.m., Monday, Jan. 20. Regular-admission tickets are $16.50, $13.50 and $9.50 and available at Tickets Unlimited outlets or the arena.
<P>
<P>3.If the winter doldrums have set in, pack up the babies and head over to the American Museum of Science and Energy. The museum has opened some new exhibits. There&#39;s a Magic School Bus Activity Corner with a bus cutout and all ready for posing. There&#39;s also a Welcome to the Internet Exhibit at which visitors, young and old, can discover how to navigate the Internet. The museum is open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. seven days a week, and there&#39;s no admission charge. The museum is at 300 S. Tulane Ave. in Oak Ridge.
<P>
<P>4.Speaking of the American Museum of Science and Energy, it&#39;s time to build a house for the birds. The museum&#39;s annual bluebird nesting box building will be Saturday, Jan. 25. Before you can build, you need to reserve your birdhouse kit by calling the museum&#39;s Discovery Shop at 576-3229. Kits are $6.50. On Jan. 25, bring a hammer and come to the 300 S. Tulane Ave. museum in Oak Ridge, where you can build your house any time between 9 a.m. and noon.
<P>
<P>5.Speaking of birds, you can go birdwatching and not even get cold. The Frank H. McClung Museum at the University of Tennessee is exhibiting 250 years of hand-colored prints of birds. Those prints include some by artist and ornithologist John James Audubon. The museum at UT&#39;s Circle Park Drive has no admission charge and is open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. weekdays, 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Saturdays and 1-5 p.m. Sundays.

        <p><font size="5">A</font>USTIN, Texas -- Frozen cheese.
        Electronics incompetence. Frustrating frugality. </p>
        <p>These are a few of his own mother's quirks that Albert
        Brooks wove into ''Mother.'' Other than that, he says,
        the new comedy isn't autobiographical. </p>
        <p>Heck, it wasn't even free therapy. Brooks, who
        co-wrote, directed and stars in ''Mother,'' which opens
        today in local theaters, says he'd already solved his
        mother issues long before he started on this film. </p>
        <p>''I find that before you write them, you sort of have
        to work through the problem, so that's the therapeutic
        part,'' says Brooks, who has confronted other life crises
        as writer, director and star of ''Modern Romance,''
        ''Lost in America'' and ''Defending Your Life.'' </p>
        <p>''I had to reach a point with my mother years ago
        where I sort of got it; I figured it out -- why she is
        who she is, why our relationship is -- and then I could
        make a movie about it.'' </p>
        <p>Though Brooks wasn't consciously trying to appeal to a
        mainstream audience, he does acknowledge that
        ''everybody's got a mother.'' Still, speaking to
        reporters at the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin, he says he
        believes his film explores new territory. </p>
        <p>''I'd never seen a realistic mother-son movie,'' says
        Brooks, 49. ''I mean, the fact that I was able to get
        this title, 'Mother,' it shocked me. After 80 years of
        moviemaking, the title banks still have that word left.''
        </p>
        <p>In ''Mother,'' Brooks plays Los Angeles-based
        science-fiction novelist John Henderson. Feeling confused
        after his second divorce, John decides he'll never be
        able to have a successful relationship with a woman until
        he can understand the relationship he has with his
        mother. </p>
        <p>He moves back into his mom's house in northern
        California, restoring his old bedroom to the decor of his
        high-school years. His widowed mother, Beatrice, is
        puzzled and unenthusiastic about the great experiment,
        and his younger brother, Jeff (Rob Morrow), is frankly
        jealous. </p>
        <p>For the title role, Brooks tapped Debbie Reynolds, the
        mother of an old friend, Carrie Fisher. </p>
        <p>''When I finished this script, I knew I needed an
        event,'' says Brooks, whose work in 1987's ''Broadcast
        News'' earned him an Academy Award nomination for best
        supporting actor. ''I wanted somebody as special as I
        could get . . . and I wanted someone purposely that you
        hadn't seen for a long, long time. That was my
        prerequisite. </p>
        <p>''Because I knew Debbie a little bit, it was not the
        first name that came to my mind because I was, like, too
        close to the forest to see the tree. So the first person
        I thought of was Doris Day.'' </p>
        <p>After two months of build-up, Brooks traveled to
        Carmel for a lunch meeting, only to be told by Day that
        she wasn't interested. </p>
        <p>''She said, 'Thank you. You made me realize I never
        want to do movies again,' '' recalls Brooks, battling the
        wintry brown of the Texas landscape in a spring-toned
        green suit. </p>
        <p>Happy to have helped with Day's catharsis but
        frustrated that he still lacked a leading lady, he next
        met with Esther Williams, but the magic wasn't there. </p>
        <p>''Then it got in the press that I had offered the role
        to Nancy Reagan, but I did not offer the role to Nancy
        Reagan,'' says Brooks. ''I said as a joke to my agent one
        day, 'Gee, I wonder if Nancy Reagan wants to get back
        into acting.' </p>
        <p>''And my agent's sister is her best friend, and they
        sent her a script. And she went crazy; she loved the
        script. So I went to her house, and we sort of worked a
        little bit. </p>
        <p>''Weeks before I would ever have to make a casting
        decision, she said, 'You know, this is not the best time
        of my life for me to consider this, but I wish I could
        consider it. This is so much fun. Thank you.' '' </p>
        <p>At one point, the studio wanted Brooks to consider
        Angela Lansbury. </p>
        <p>''I said, 'Correct me if I'm wrong; isn't she English?
        How am I her child? What scene do I have -- ''Mother, you
        left our family and went to study with the queen!'' ' '' </p>
        <p>Shirley MacLaine, who'd been in ''Defending Your
        Life,'' was another suggestion. </p>
        <p>''She's a brilliant American actress,'' says Brooks.
        ''But Shirley MacLaine is the one who winds up getting
        all of these roles. </p>
        <p>''And I just did not want . . . you to see the woman
        playing this title role who was in four other movies this
        year. I just didn't think that would be good.'' </p>
        <p>When it comes to ''Mother,'' Brooks thinks he knows
        best. </p>
        <p>''I believe in a casting god,'' he says. ''I know I
        got the best person. Debbie fits the bill (in every)
        regard. She's brilliant. </p>
        <p>''Her own daughter, at the end of this movie, called
        me in tears. She never thought her mother would hit those
        notes. 'Cause nothing Debbie has ever done has been this
        real. She's never been asked to. </p>
        <p>'' 'Singin' in the Rain,' they didn't ask her to be
        low-key. But I knew she could do it. She didn't even know
        she could do it; I knew she could do it.'' </p>
        <p>Brooks says Reynolds, 64, had to do only a scene and a
        half to convince him to cast her. </p>
        <p>''I was in the middle of the second scene -- and this
        is when I knew she was the mother -- and I said to her,
        'OK, so you have this role,' '' he recalls. </p>
        <p>''And she said, 'Well, don't many people have to make
        that decision?' I said, 'No, I can make that decision.'
        'They let you do that?' I said, 'You're the mother.' '' </p>
        <p>In ''Mother,'' Beatrice Henderson freezes foods that
        were never meant to be frozen, raises generic shopping to
        an art form and compulsively tells strangers that her son
        has failed at two marriages. The laugh count rises while
        John tries to break her of these habits. </p>
        <p>One of his own mother's practices was equally funny,
        Brooks says. </p>
        <p>''Years and years and years ago, whenever she would
        fly, she would steal the headphones,'' he says. ''Because
        I was a stereo buff, she thought she was doing me a
        favor. </p>
        <p>''I said, 'Unless you take the whole seat, I can't use
        them. This doesn't fit into anything. Steal me the row,
        and then I can work the stereo.' '' </p>
        <p>Brooks, born Albert Lawrence Einstein, comes by his
        comic genius naturally. His father was radio comedian
        Harry Einstein, and he is the brother of Bob Einstein,
        a.k.a. ''Super Dave'' Osborne, the comic stuntman. </p>
        <p>''Everybody, I think, in school finds that they're
        something,'' says Brooks. ''They're either the
        best-looking, the best athlete, the smartest. I just was
        the funniest kid from the get-go. </p>
        <p>''I knew I could make people laugh. It's how I talked
        myself out of getting a D. You use whatever you can use,
        and a short skirt wouldn't-a done it for me. Unless I
        went to Scotland.'' </p>
        <p>It took a long time for Brooks to parlay his comic
        ability into an acting career. </p>
        <p>''Even though I wanted to be an actor, at 19, when I
        started professionally, I couldn't get any acting
        roles,'' he says. ''The few roles there were were all
        going to Richard Dreyfuss. </p>
        <p>''So I was convinced to do stand-up, and they told me
        that would get me into the movies, but it didn't -- I
        just got more stand-up. I had to force myself out of that
        and into the other.'' </p>
        <p>Brooks made landmark comedy albums -- ''Comedy Minus
        One'' and ''A Star Is Bought'' -- and gradually segued
        from television variety shows to recurring appearances on
        ''The Odd Couple.'' He made short films for ''Saturday
        Night Live'' and launched his feature career with a role
        in Martin Scorsese's ''Taxi Driver.'' </p>
        <p>His first theatrical feature as director and star was
        the 1979 docu-parody ''Real Life,'' co-written with
        frequent collaborator Monica Johnson. He has balanced his
        work as actor-filmmaker with gigs as an actor for hire in
        such films as ''Private Benjamin,'' ''Twilight Zone --
        The Movie'' and 1987's ''Broadcast News,'' for which he
        won an Oscar nomination for supporting actor. </p>
        <p>Brooks says he isn't as confused by the world as his
        screen personae often seem to be. </p>
        <p>''The characters play out the things that you normally
        just think about,'' he says. ''I mean, you wouldn't
        normally drop out, but you do it in the movie ('Lost in
        America'). </p>
        <p>''You wouldn't really move back in (to your mother's
        house), but you could. Actually, people are moving back
        in. I saw in Time magazine . . . this is, like, a trend,
        but more for financial reasons. But for psychological
        reasons, it's a really funny idea to really do it. </p>
        <p>''Comedy is sort of like holding your hand up in the
        hurricane and seeing how windy it is. That's all you can
        really do. It's like trying to literally pursue a dream
        instead of just dreaming. </p>
        <p>''You've actually gotta go do it. You can't just think
        about it in the movie, or they'd never make the movie.'' </p>
        <p>While critics have loved most of his movies, Brooks
        has never made a blockbuster. But that doesn't upset him.
        </p>
        <p>''Look, my films don't cost that much money,'' he
        says. ''Seventy-million-dollar films that make $3
        million, that's disappointing. 'Defending Your Life'
        grossed $20 million and then went on to do well in all
        the other areas. I don't think anybody lost a dollar.'' </p>
        <p>Not that he would mind having a big commercial hit. </p>
        <p>''I would love it,'' he says. ''But you see, the thing
        is, I can't make that happen. Greater people than myself
        have come into this world and attempted -- Van Gogh I
        don't think cut off his ear 'cause he was selling well. </p>
        <p>''I wish I was mainstream and 'Tommy Boy' were the
        oddity. That would be a fun world to live in. I wish
        things were like that, but they're not like that. If I
        can keep working, then I'm happy I can keep working. </p>
        <p>''Cable being what it is, all my movies have now
        become way more popular than they were originally. I
        mean, I get lots of letters about 'Real Life' 'cause it's
        been showing on the comedy channel for the last three
        years, and everyone who sees it laughs at it.'' </p>
        <p>In fact, while it might seem a disadvantage to be
        Albert Brooks and not be able to enjoy watching an Albert
        Brooks movie, ultimately that isn't the case. </p>
        <p>''I'll tell you something,'' he says. ''Two or three
        years down the line, I can watch the movie and forget I
        ever made it. I really can. I gotta get, like, years
        away. </p>
        <p>''But sometimes on a rainy Sunday if it comes on HBO,
        I settle back and I watch the movie, and I go, 'Hey,
        pretty funny.' '' </p>

        &#39;&#39;20th Century Blues,&#39;&#39; Marianne Faithfull (RCA Victor)
<P>    If any idea for an album seemed like a natural, this must be it. &#39;&#39;20th Century Blues&#39;&#39; features ragged-voiced rock chanteuse Marianne Faithfull crooning out works by German expatriates Kurt Weill, Bertolt Brecht and Fredrich Hollaender, along with a few other appropriately moody tunes.
<P>    Recorded during a live concert in Paris in the winter of 1995, the albums were dubbed by Faithfull &#39;&#39;An Evening in the Weimar Republic.&#39;&#39; Accompanied only by pianist Paul Trueblood, Faithfull cements her talent as a perfect interpreter of sad and cynical songs.
<P>   Many of the tunes, including the Brecht/Weill numbers &#39;&#39;Alabama Song,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Pirate Jenny&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Mack the Knife&#39;&#39; and Hollaender&#39;s &#39;&#39;Falling In Love Again,&#39;&#39; were actually written in Germany during the Weimar era.
<P>   Others, including Noel Coward&#39;s &#39;&#39;20th Century Blues&#39;&#39; and Harry Nilsson&#39;s &#39;&#39;Don&#39;t Forget Me&#39;&#39; (the latter written in the &#39;70s) simply capture the era&#39;s spirit.
<P>   Selections from &#39;&#39;The Threepenny Opera&#39;&#39; by Brecht and Weill are new translations by Irish playwright Frank McGuinness.
<P>   These versions are considerably grittier and less poetic than more familiar versions of the songs. Still, probably no one since Lotte Lenya has given such a vocal embodiment to these songs&#39; tales of tragedy and corruption.
<P><B>Grade: A-</B>
<P><B></B>
<P>&#39;&#39;Never Never Land,&#39;&#39; Joseph Patrick Moore (Moore Music)
<P>   Former Knoxvillian Joseph Patrick Moore has taken his funky bass to the wilds of Memphis.
<P>   The bassist&#39;s new disc, &#39;&#39;Never Never Land,&#39;&#39; is a likable collection of old-fashioned funk and jazz fusion. The disc also features some of the cream of the Memphis jazz scene.
<P>   Cool tunes, including &#39;&#39;Intuition&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Corner of the World,&#39;&#39; are easy to listen to but are an edge above much of the &#39;&#39;lite&#39;&#39; jazz on the market.
<P>   Moore and the band play with thought and feeling, and every now and then toss in a hot surprise. Some of the best cuts are filled with nice brass work, and soprano saxophonist Jim Spake often stands out in the talented group. The disc may be hard to find, but it&#39;s worth searching for. <B>Grade: B
<P></B>
<P>&#39;&#39;Voice of an Angel,&#39;&#39; Della Reese (RCA) 
<P>
<P>   In the past two decades, Della Reese has become better known as an actress (most recently on TV&#39;s &#39;&#39;Touched By an Angel&#39;&#39;), but this collection of tracks from the early &#39;60s proves that Reese was a top-notch pop singer.
<P>   In this set, Reese belts out standards that include &#39;&#39;Two Sleepy People,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;I Had the Craziest Dream,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;I&#39;m Just a Lucky So and So&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Guess I&#39;ll Hang My Tears Out to Dry.&#39;&#39; While Reese&#39;s brassy style was on the way out at the time this music was recorded, this music is ripe for rediscovery. <B>Grade: B+

        <font size="5">T</font>he rating is done on a basis of
        one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five being the
        highest: </p>
        <p>-- ONE FIERCE BEER COASTER, Bloodhound Gang
        (Geffen/Republic) </p>
        <p>''I'm the root of all that's evil, yeah, but you can
        call me Cookie,'' sings Jimmy Pop Ali, lead vocalist and
        overall top dog of the Bloodhound Gang on the group's hit
        single, ''Fire Water Burn.'' </p>
        <p>Singing flatly against what begins as acoustic support
        then erupts into an electrified Weezer-ly chug, Ali
        grinds through an expletive-not-deleted free-for-all of
        irreverence, suggesting Lawrence Welk, Kurt Cobain and
        others are in hell, Emmanuel Lewis is the Antichrist and
        the roof (the roof, the roof) is on fire and should just
        be left to burn. </p>
        <p>The Philadelphia-area band's raunchy ''One Fierce Beer
        Coaster'' was released on Republic Records in September
        but got a major-label break from Geffen, which
        re-released the album (minus two tracks) in December. </p>
        <p>It's sure to offend both humorless PC extremists and
        the religious right, but those likely aren't the target
        demographics for the group anyway. Ali's work -- which at
        a glance might be taken as sexist, racist, homophobic and
        godless -- is ribald parody at its best. Self-effacing
        and admittedly juvenile, Ali is far more clever than he
        lets on. </p>
        <p>For starters, the album is more diverse than it has
        any right to be. From full-tilt punk tracks to slamming
        rap to the funkiest hip-hop/rock concoction since vintage
        Big Audio Dynamite, ''One Fierce Beer Coaster'' is an
        innovative marvel. If it were only an instrumental album,
        it would be worthy. </p>
        <p>But Jimmy Pop Ali at the mike makes this an essential
        album to anyone who can cope with a little distasteful
        humor. </p>
        <p>Confessing to an embarrassing physical shortcoming
        (more than once), he boasts of his compensating sexual
        talents; he embraces nerdom but still tells the world
        where to get off (''I hate people that think that I care
        what they think,'' he says on ''Shut Up''); and he longs
        to be a handsome pseudo-gay man so he can get chicks
        (''Scoring with a supermodel would be easy''). </p>
        <p>That B.A.D.-sounding track, ''Lift Your Head Up High
        (And Blow Your Brains Out),'' is a particular triumph as
        Jimmy Pop Ali leads his chanting band in a mantra against
        self-pitiers, ''Life's short and hard like a
        body-buidling elf/So save the planet and kill yourself.''
        </p>
        <p>This guy even does a blithe braggadocio duet with
        Vanilla Ice on the reverberating ''Boom.'' Talk about
        guts. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Ali's hilarious cultural references bridge
        baby boomers to Generation X: He dreams up a morbidly
        violent ''Gilligan's Island'' scenario on ''Why's
        Everybody Always Pickin' on Me?'', and ''Your Only
        Friends Are Make Believe'' has Mr. Rogers going off on
        his mailman before Ali overtly digs at Duran Duran,
        swiping the chorus melody from DD's ''Hungry Like the
        Wolf'' for his own chorus. </p>
        <p>And in a nod to fans, there's the anthemic ''Going
        Nowhere Slow,'' which is a roll call of 70-odd cities
        where the band likes to play . . . ''but nowhere in New
        Jersey.'' </p>
        <p>That's New Jersey's loss. </p>
        <p>Rating (five possible): XXXX </p>
        <p>-- GOUDS THUMB, Gouds Thumb (Critique) </p>
        <p>Far be it from the Maine-based band Gouds Thumb to
        break modern rock out of its winter of discontent. </p>
        <p>Instead, the four-man group falls in line with the
        genre on a self-titled debut that features overplayed
        instruments, oversung vocals and underdeveloped songs. </p>
        <p>The single ''29'' (which features supporting vocals by
        Matthew Sweet) and ''Beautiful Local'' stand apart from
        other tracks thanks to their memorable refrains. But the
        blustery ''Gouds Thumb'' is primarily an aggressive, yet
        characterless, acting-out by a band indistinguishable
        from hordes of other groups. </p>
        <p>Lead singer Connor, whose emotional range mimics the
        Vedderesque screech-and-groan, handicaps Gouds Thumb with
        disconnected, unenlightening lyrics -- inadequate
        attempts at symbolism that he belts out with plaintive
        importance. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, guitarist Walter Craven, bass player Jeff
        Kral and drummer Bernard Willimann are locked in
        unimaginative drudgery of their own. </p>
        <p>Rarely backing off from the stormy sameness of the
        bulk of tracks, the band gears down twice: once for a
        brush with psychedelia on ''Chemicals'' and again on the
        moany ''Apnea'' (which is reprised at album's end as a
        gratuitous ''hidden'' track). Beyond ''29'' and
        ''Beautiful Local,'' the only saving grace to this album
        is its power. </p>
        <p>The glut of bands like Gouds Thumb is shutting down
        what was once a vivacious offshoot of popular music. And
        the term ''progressive rock,'' once used interchangeably
        with ''modern rock,'' no longer applies. </p>
        <p>Rating: XX </p>
        <p>-- ''ALL THAT: THE ALBUM,'' various acts (Loud) </p>
        <p>''All That: The Album'' is a choice overview of
        today's most promising young R&amp;B acts, but it isn't
        much of a testimonial to the humor in the sketch comedy
        show ''All That.'' </p>
        <p>The album is a promotional vehicle for the program,
        and it includes songs by nine music acts as well as
        excerpts from the youth-oriented Nickelodeon show. </p>
        <p>Those bits from the skits are decidedly feeble. (One
        interlude is nothing but a girl declaring, ''If you don't
        know the difference between baloney and your underwear,
        then I ain't eatin' a sandwich at your house!'') </p>
        <p>On the other hand, the collection of songs -- most of
        them hits from the past couple of years -- is rather
        strong. </p>
        <p>The male band Soul for Real chips in the harmony-rich
        ''Candy Rain,'' for example, while its female
        counterpart, MoKenStef, contributes a sleek ''He's
        Mine.'' </p>
        <p>Teen divas Brandy and Aaliyah are represented by the
        funky ''Baby'' and the jazz-inflected ''Age Ain't Nothing
        But a Number,'' respectively. And though her song gets a
        bit numbing, the silky voiced Faith Evans delivers a fine
        ''You Used To Love Me.'' </p>
        <p>A pair of rap tracks make the cut, too -- Coolio's
        springy ''Fantastic Voyage'' and Naughty by Nature's
        boisterous ''Clap Yo' Hands.'' </p>
        <p>''All That: The Album'' includes two Immature songs --
        the solid new track ''Watch Me Do My Thing'' and the
        plucky, mid-tempo devotional, ''We Got It'' -- and the
        trio TLC also is here twice -- once with the show's
        opening theme and once with the closer. </p>
        <p>To its credit, the album doesn't slip in lesser tracks
        and nobodies. These are all relatively big names on more
        or less equal footing. Although their songs aren't
        overflowing with originality, they're competently
        performed. </p>
        <p>To its discredit, the album slips in undeniably lame
        attempts at humor. </p>
        <p>Rating: XXX </p>

        <p><i>By Doug Mason, Entertainment writer</i> </p>
        <p>Shangri-la, Xanadu, Eden -- each is a name people have
        given to a dreamland where all is beauty and pleasure. </p>
        <p>The practice still exists. But now these fantasic
        lands are called theme parks -- or amusement parks, which
        are the same thing but with a smaller licensing fee. </p>
        <p>Instead of fantasizing of life in these realms, we,
        the citizens of an all-access-allowed age, get to visit
        them with an all-inclusive pass. Parking extra, of
        course. </p>
        <p>Mickey has his own magic kingdom. So does Dolly. Both
        are popular destinations for East Tennesseans. </p>
        <p>But the theme/amusement park universe is much larger.
        Within an easy-to-hard-day's drive of Knoxville are
        world-class roller coasters, themed rides based on major
        movies and TV shows, cartoon-lands inhabited by such
        faves as Bugs Bunny and Fred Flintstone to Brother and
        Sister Bear, and variety shows that employ collegiate
        drama majors from all along the Eastern Seaboard. </p>
        <p>We stretched the ``day's drive'' to 550 miles and
        collected information from nine parks within that range.
        And here it is, arranged from the nearest to the
        farthest. </p>
        <p><a name="Six-Flags"><b>Six Flags over Georgia, Atlanta</b></a>
        </p>
        <p>Approximate miles from Knoxville: 200. </p>
        <p>What's there: Rides and shows in five themed areas:
        USA/French, Confederate, Lickskillet/Cotton States,
        Spanish. </p>
        <p>Special events: Six Flags is celebrating the
        International Year of the Roller Coaster with the Big Six
        Challenge. A commemorative pin is given to anyone riding
        the Great American Scream Machine, the Ninja, the Viper,
        the Mind Bender, the Georgia Cyclone and the Dahlonega
        Mine Train on the same day. </p>
        <p>Cartoon tie-in: Bugs Bunny World children's area;
        Warner Brothers cartoon characters roam the park. </p>
        <p>Movie tie-in: Batman Stunt Spectacular. </p>
        <p>Shows: country music at the Crystal Pistol Music Hall;
        laser/fireworks show nightly through Aug. 11. </p>
        <p>Non-roller coaster rides: The Great Gasp, 20-story
        parachute drop. Free Fall creates the feeling of falling
        of a 10-story building. Fearless Freeps Dare Devil Dive
        -- after a 100-foot free fall flyers swoop at 50-plus mph
        up into the air. Thunder River and Splashwater Falls
        water rides. Carnival rides and attractions. </p>
        <p>Admission: $32; children ages 3 to 9 and adults 55 and
        over, $21. For operating hours and other information call
        770-948-9290. </p>
        <p><a name="Opryland"><b>Opryland USA, Nashville.</b></a>
        </p>
        <p>Approximate miles from Knoxville: 200. </p>
        <p>What's there: Opryland has rides, of course, but
        country music is what it's all about. The park offers its
        own musical variety shows plus top-name guest
        entertainers. </p>
        <p>New in '96: </p>
        <p>``$25,000 Game Show.'' Audience participation show
        patterned after TV game shows. Rotating hosts are Bob
        Eubanks (``The Newlywed Game''), Jim Lange (``The Dating
        Game'') and Jamie Farr (``M*A*S*H''). </p>
        <p>Newest rides: </p>
        <p>The Hangman inverted roller coaster; turns riders
        upside down five times on a serpentine track that peaks
        at 104 feet off the ground. </p>
        <p>The Skycoaster, combination of sky-diving and
        hang-gliding. Flyers are harnessed and suspended from
        173-foot-tall arch, then let go to fly through the air at
        60 mph. </p>
        <p>Other rides: Chaos indoor roller coaster. Old Mill
        Scream and Grizzly River Rampage water rides. Screamin'
        Delta Demon wheeled sleds that travel through a
        1,700-foot-long chute. Wabash Cannonball corkscrew roller
        coaster. The Barnstormer, free-fall ride from 100-foot
        tower. Carnival and kid's rides. </p>
        <p>Musical showcases: ``Headin' West,'' country-western
        variety show. ``I Hear America Singing,''
        25th-anniversary revival of country variety show that
        opened with Opryland in 1972. ``Rising Star,'' showcase
        for hot new country bands. ``Country Music U.S.A.,''
        tribute show to such country greats as Hank Williams,
        Patsy Cline and Garth Brooks. ``Sing the Glory Down''
        gospel show. ``The Mike Snider Show,'' featuring the
        Grand Ole Opry comedian/banjo picker and his three-piece
        band. ``The Country and Bluegrass Show,'' featuring
        bluegrass, mountain and country music. ``Kickin'
        Country,'' Cajun-flavored hoe down. </p>
        <p>The stars come out: Opryland ambassador Porter
        Waggoner and other Grand Ole Opry performers appear daily
        to meet guests, sign autographs and pose for photographs.
        </p>

        metro editor</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">I</font>n 1997, I resolve to get my
        burgeoning sports card collection better organized,
        finish opening boxes of cards, decide how many opened
        wrappers I really want to save for mail-in offers or
        potential collectible value and not to put off writing
        this column until the last minute. </p>
        <p>Yeah, right. </p>
        <p>What should you really look for in 1997? </p>
        <p>With the NFL playoffs finally under way, quarterbacks <b>Brett
        Favre </b>of the Green Bay Packers and <b>John Elway</b>
        of the Denver Broncos are generating even more interest
        from collectors. Elway and wide receiver <b>Jerry Rice</b>
        of the San Francisco 49ers will end up in the Hall of
        Fame. Remarkably, their cards are still priced in
        reasonable ranges. </p>
        <p>I've never been much of a Dallas Cowboys fan although
        I have enjoyed watching and reading about running back <b>Emmitt
        Smith</b>, who owns a hobby shop in Florida, and
        quarterback <b>Troy Aikman </b>because of their talent
        and character. Their card values have softened slightly
        because of the team's struggles. However, they are still
        collectors' favorites. </p>
        <p>Another Cowboy hasn't fared as well. A year ago,<b> </b>wide
        receiver <b>Michael Irvin's</b> card values were soaring.
        Then, prior to this season, he was arrested on drug
        charges. His latest run-in with the law (accusations of
        holding a woman at gunpoint while a teammate and another
        man raped her) has tarnished his Dallas star again. The
        allegations weaken his position among collectors. If the
        charges are substantiated -- and Irvin has proclaimed his
        innocence -- it could mean the death knell for him as a
        hobby figure. </p>
        <p><b>BASEBALL STUFF: </b>All major card companies have
        released or are getting ready to ship 1997 baseball
        products. One of the coolest is by Upper Deck, which is
        making cards with actual pieces of ''game-worn'' jerseys.
        Popular players such as <b>Ken Griffey</b> of the Seattle
        Mariners are included in the set. The company says you
        can almost ''smell the greatness.'' No sweat. </p>
        <p>Pacific is releasing a 36-card set dubbed ''Latinos en
        Grandes Ligas'' (Latinos of the Major Leagues) that will
        include <b>Andruw &127;Jones</b> and <b>Javier Lopez </b>of
        the Atlanta Braves, <b>Rey Ordonez</b> of the New York
        Mets, <b>Alex Rodriguez</b> of the Seattle Mariners, <b>Mariano
        Rivera </b>of the New York Yankees and <b>Juan Gonzalez </b>of
        the Texas Rangers. </p>
        <p><b>SPACE JAM:</b> Did you get all the Space Jam
        products for Christmas? Let's see. There were pajamas,
        sheets, hats, board games, action figures, talking
        Michael Jordan doll, golfing Jordan, baseball Jordan,
        basketball Jordan, cartoon characters with Jordan,
        trading cards, etc. The Chicago Bulls star, who is
        arguably responsible for igniting the collectibles
        industry, is still the player to get in 1997. </p>
        <p>Buy two of anything with Jordan on it -- one to play
        with, the other to put away and sell at a flea market at
        outrageous profit years from now. (My talking Jordan doll
        is in the closet.) </p>
        <p><b>NEW BOOK:</b> Sports Collectors Digest has issued
        its ''1997 Standard Catalog of Football, Basketball &amp;
        Hockey Cards.'' The catalog includes card prices for 1996
        releases, including obscure ones that are hard to find in
        monthly card price guides. The 750-page book also
        includes a glossary of hobby terms from ''obverse'' (the
        front of the card displaying the picture) to
        ''skip-numbered'' (card set not numbered in exact
        sequence). In an industry of ever-increasing product and
        innovation, the glossary is an added benefit. </p>

<h1>Banners</h1>

<p><font size="5" face="Brush Script MT"><b>B</b></font>anners
are perhaps the most common type of advertising on the Web today.
The reason for their popularity is due to the impact they receive
from their prominent position on high traffic sites. Banners will
be positioned throughout key pages. They can be linked to a
company&#146;s current Web site and include dynamic elements such
as blinking text, e-mail links, animated images, etc.&#133; The
cost for banners is based on a &quot;Cost-per-thousand
customer&quot; or CPM rate. Advertisers can choose from two types
of banners. The strip banner is a horizontal banner measuring 460
X 61 pixels. The column banner is a rectangular banner, placed in
the page column and measuring 144 X 61 pixels. The weight of the
banners cannot exceed 15K. Advertisers can decide how often they
would like their banner to appear based on current traffic
figures for the site. Advertisers are therefore, getting a
guaranteed number of views. Other banners will be set-up to
rotate throughout the site at random. Banners can be placed on
the Homepage of the site but these will be priced at a premium
CPM rate. Advertisers will receive a detailed activity report
each month listing the number of views their banners received.</p>

<p>Sponsorship includes rotation presence on all primary and
secondary pages. The site will be limited to 10 sponsors. Each
sponsor will appear on the Sponsor Page and all ads will be
linked either to the sponsor&#146;s Web site or a Back page
created free of charge by the Online Publishing staff. The primary
pages will have one large column ad. This spot will rotate among
the sponsors. The secondary pages will have smaller column ads similar
to those appearing on the Sponsor Page. The idea is to keep the
clutter down and provide sponsors with some exclusivity and a major presence throughout
the site.</p>

<p>The goal of The Knoxville News-Sentinel Online is to provide
useful and accurate community information at a single World Wide
Web location. The Knoxville News-Sentinel Online has quickly
become the Number One Internet resource for what&#146;s happening
in Knoxville and East Tennessee. The site is currently receiving
approximately 250,000 visits and over 1.7 million hits each
month. The Online Publishing staff continually reviews user
comments in order to meet the needs of its customers. Currently,
community health appears to be an area that is lacking coverage.
For this reason, Online Publishing has added a Community Health
area to The Knoxville News-Sentinel Online site. The area has a
direct link off of the homepage and contains the following
content areas:</p>

<p>Each section is sponsored by an area healthcare provider. The
provider has full exclusivity to the area for a period of six months.
The sponsor provides all content and can update as often as once
a week. The provider also has first right of refusal to the area
at the end of six months. The content of the area is of an
educational nature. There will be no commercialism of the areas,
however, each sponsor has a banner at the top of each section
that is linked to the sponsor&#146;s own Web site. If the sponsor
does not have a web site, a page is developed for the sponsor,
free of charge, that provides room to promote the sponsor&#146;s
services.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Content Submission</b></font></p>

<p>Each sponsor is responsible for providing the Online
Publishing staff content in electronic format (i.e. Word, Wordperfect,
etc.). Graphic design and layout is be developed by the Online
Staff for continuity purposes. The sponsor is able to determine
the content categories and provide their own customized logos.
Sponsor photos can be scanned by the Online Publishing staff if
needed. The sponsor is not limited to the amount of content,
provided the content pertains to the topic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Tracking Reports</b></font></p>

<p>Monthly tracking reports are provided to the sponsor detailing
the activity at each area. The reports include views and hits and
any additional statistics that are generated by the Online
Publishing staff.</p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Cost</b></font></p>

<p>The cost will $250 per area per month ($200/month for 3 or
more areas). This price is good for the initial six months but is
subject to change upon the renegotiating of the sponsor&#146;s
contract.</p>

<p>Sponsors are provided an Infinet Internet account at cost
($16.95) including e-mail and World Wide Web access. Online
Publishing can set-up the software and train staff members on
e-mail and Web browsing at a charge of $10 per hour. Normal
set-up and training totals 4 to 6 hours. This depends on the
current configuration of your computer system. The ideal system
is one that is separated from any networking, contains at least a
28.8 modem, 16 MB of RAM, min. 486 operating system and utilizes
a Windows 95 interface with the Plus package. Other systems will
work, but set-up may take longer. System recommendations and
hardware venders can be provided.</p>

<p><font size="5"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>

<p>One of the appeals of Web advertising is the ability to track
exact numbers of Ad views and user activity. Online publishing
will provide monthly statistics to each advertiser detailing the
activity on each Web site. This includes Ad view numbers, page
summaries, and server summaries (where users are coming from). As
technology advances, Online Publishing will provide additional tracking information
such as click through rates.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Tracking Definitions</b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>Clicks - </b>Every time a user clicks on your banner, it is
counted as a &quot;click.&quot; This measurement lets you judge
the response to any Ad that you are running.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Click Ratio or Click Through Rate - </b>A ratio that
indicates the success of an advertiser in attracting visitors to
click on their Ad. For example, if during 1 million impressions
there are 20,000 clicks on your banner, your click ratio is 2%.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Page Accesses - </b>This refers to when a page is
downloaded and viewed by the user.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Ad Impressions/Ad Views</b> - The number of times a banner
image is downloaded to a page being viewed by a visitor. This is
the standard way of determining exposure for an advertisement on
the web.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Hits - </b>The term &quot;hits&quot; is used by Webmasters
to describe the relative horsepower that their site can successfully
handle. It has no relevance to an advertiser.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Back Page - </b>A &quot;Back Page&quot; is defined as a
page built for an advertiser which is linked to the advertiser&#146;s
banner. A back page is used if an advertiser does not currently
have a Web site that can be linked to their banners.</p>

`I'd Rather Be Ugly Than Stuppid' shares those 
Venable insights</font> <p><font size=2><i>By Susan Alexander, Assistant features editor</i></font> </p>
<p><!--dateline--><br>
</p>
<p>Sam Venable, coffee drinker extraordinaire, eagerly awaited the arrival of 
some Colombian high-test he had paid dearly for from an out-of-town 
mail-order company. </p>
<p>The big day finally came. Three pounds of pure, unadulterated caffeine 
greeted him on his front stoop, left behind by the UPS man. Already Sam 
could smell the first cup of java this package would create. </p>
<p>There was just one small problem: Sam discovered his much-anticipated 
coffee was still in bean form, not ground up as he had assumed it would be. </p>
<p>Thus the next morning, News-Sentinel staffers started their day with a 
frantic message from Genius Boy, begging to borrow a grinder from any 
connoisseur willing to loan. </p>
<p>Which calls into question the title of Venable's latest collection of 
News-Sentinel columns, ''I'd Rather Be Ugly Than Stuppid.'' </p>
<p>The always prolific, always opinionated Venable has assembled his deepest 
thoughts from the last five years' worth of columns for this 266-page tome. </p>
<p>We are talking really deep thoughts -- about things like Betty Crocker's 
latest facelift. About a university researcher delving into (ahem) the subject 
of nose picking. About the fat grams in a Moon Pie. About the abundance 
of hickeys among East Tennesseans. About Goldie, Venable's cowardly 
dog. Basically, about any off-the-wall, out-of-left-field subject Sam has 
tackled on the pages of The News-Sentinel. </p>
<p>There's a serious side to the new book, as well. In one chapter Venable 
removes his tongue from cheek and discusses a variety of sobering subjects: 
the short life of a child who was beaten to death by his parents, the ghosts 
of war that continue to haunt old soldiers, the time Venable was upstaged at 
a prison commencement ceremony, as well as warm memories of author 
Alex Haley and of his own father, Sam Venable Sr. </p>
<p>R. Daniel Proctor has added his special brand of humor to this book. 
Proctor, The News-Sentinel's art director and Venable's journalistic 
sidekick, penned more than four dozen illustrations that accompany 
Venable's essays. </p>
<p>''I'd Rather Be Ugly Than Stuppid'' is the fourth collection of Venable's 
work published by The News-Sentinel. The others are ''A Handful of 
Thumbs and Two Left Feet,'' ''Two or Three Degrees Off Plumb'' and 
''One Size Fits All and Other Holiday Myths.'' </p>
<p>''I don't like to think of these books as rehashed old columns,'' Venable said 
in his best politically correct posture. ''Rather, I like to think of this as a 
professional recycling effort.'' </p>
<p>''I'd Rather Be Ugly Than Stuppid'' ($11.95) goes on sale Monday at The 
News-Sentinel and area bookstores. It also is available via mail order from 
the newspaper (see accompanying order form). On Wednesday through 
Sunday, Oct. 9-13, Venable will sign copies of the new book at the 
Museum of Appalachia's Fall Homecoming festival in Norris. </p>
<p>Sam admits his thought processes are plugged in a little differently from 
most folks'. He considers it one of his best qualities as a writer: When other 
reporters are interviewing the guy who wins a race, Sam's talking with the 
runner who came in last. When everybody else in Knoxville is crammed into 
Neyland Stadium for a big UT-Alabama football game, he's at the campus 
library, searching for students cuddled up with a textbook. </p>
<p>His unique perspective, coupled with a fair dose of deadline panic, account 
for his success. </p>
<p>Like most journalists, Sam doesn't believe in working ahead of deadline. 
No, he's always just a step or two in front of an anxious editor or a 
desperate artist. </p>
<p>''I don't know if the folks who work for newspapers are Type-A people in 
a Type-A job, or if the job turns them into Type-A's,'' he muses, chewing 
another in an endless progression of toothpicks to sawdust. </p>
<p>Regardless, Venable, for all his easy-going, country-boy ways, is as highly 
charged and intense as anybody in the newsroom. </p>
<p>He bashes heads regularly with the computer system and unabashedly 
admits he only recently learned how to send electronic messages to his 
co-workers -- with help from a dog-eared cheat sheet. He agonizes over 
notes that one minute sit before him on his desk and the next vanish -- 
apparently to the outer limits of the solar system. </p>
<p>He cusses staplers that won't staple, tape that won't stick, chairs that lean 
too far back or not far enough. </p>
<p>That is, when he bothers to show up at the office. </p>
<p>Sam has had a sweet deal at the newspaper for years. It happens when 
you're a (drumroll, please) columnist, as he has been here since 1970: first 
covering outdoors and since 1985 writing about whatever strikes his fancy. </p>
<p>Columnists supposedly need lots of time out among the folks, doing 
research and digging up ideas. Sam does a lot of that while seated in his 
bass boat or trekking up and down East Tennessee ridges after whatever 
animal happens to be in season at the time. </p>
<p>Most of his column ideas come from the news itself. </p>
<p>''Why waste my own brain cells trying to think up something to write about 
when there are so many bizarre events taking place daily in Knoxville, 
Nashville and Washington?'' he says. ''Sometimes, I feel like politicians 
should be paid a retainer fee for all the wonderful material they supply.'' </p>
<p>When he isn't goofing off at work or just plain goofing off, Sam is likely 
pestering Mary Ann, his long-suffering wife of 27 years, who is an instructor 
at Knoxville's Computer Learning Center. They have two grown children: 
Clay, a University of Tennessee math teaching assistant who is pursuing a 
second degree in mechanical engineering; and Megan, a recent UT 
broadcasting graduate who works at Walt Disney World in Orlando. </p>
<p>But for the time being, don't look for Sam at home or at work. </p>
<p>He'll be in the coffee aisle at Kroger, sneaking his beans into the grinder. </p>

<FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>YRTLE BEACH, S.C. -- The first thing Babe and I saw when our feet (her four, my two) hit the sand was a shooting star.
<P>   It was about midnight, and we&#39;d just checked into the only motel along the 36 blocks of blinking VACANCY signs that would allow dogs. I had called ahead from Knoxville and gotten a verbal commitment over the phone from one motel that supposedly welcomed pets, but when the desk clerk saw a black lab, she changed her mind.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Only dogs under 20 pounds,&#39;&#39; she said.
<P>   My theory is that most dogs under 20 pounds are not real dogs. Which would you rather hear in the room next to you after six hours of driving on the interstate: the soft, deep, homey lullaby of a sleeping lab or the yip and screech of a jittery Chihuahua?
<P>   As for vacuuming up after -- a 4-pound peek-a-poo will fur-ball an Electrolux a lot sooner than a 90-pound, sleek-coated Labradorean.
<P>   A special blessing on all inn keepers who find room not only in their hearts but in their guest book for a woman&#39;s best friend.
<P>   Babe saw the shooting star, too. She stopped dead in her tracks and watched -- a brush stroke of invisible neon, swiped across the sky, then disappeared just before it hit the ruler-drawn line dividing the black sky from the blacker water.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Did you see that?&#39;&#39; she asked me, the way labs do, cocking her head and letting words come from out her eyes.
<P>   We took it as a sign, a good omen for the new year. Spending the first weekend of 1997 at the beach was already putting a magic spin on things to come.
<P>   The weather was perfect. Cold enough for you to wear sweat shirt and jacket if you wanted to. Warm enough not to if you didn&#39;t. Or you could go half and half, which is what I did.
<P>   Down jacket and shorts. No shoes.
<P>   Babe and I even went swimming. She practically lived in the water, chasing balls, riding the waves, and then belly-flopping in the motel baby pool to wash off the salt and sand. 
<P>   Myrtle Beach is not my beach of choice, especially in the summer, but it is by my calculation the closest beach to Knoxville and in winter is relatively vacant. The beach is wide and flat, the sand so smooth you can see the ribs of the earth at low tide, and for someone whose idea of vacation bliss includes a two-hour breakfast of IHOP potato pancakes, a jug of coffee and at least four newspapers -- it&#39;s got lots of advantages.
<P>   Several movie theaters here in Knoxville are passing out propaganda for Myrtle Beach&#39;s new, under-construction tourist complex called Broadway at the Beach, so I decided to check it out. It could also have been named Little Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge, with pelicans and sea shells instead of dolls and bears: music shows, miniature golf, specialty shops and a shortage of rest rooms. One thing they have that we do not is an IMAX Theater, which if you ask me, would bring in big bucks here. Especially if one of the offerings was an out-of-body trip through the Smokies that an IMAX production provides. If I had a couple of zillion to play around with, I&#39;d look into a franchise.
<P>   But virtual reality is no match for being on the beach in person on a bright winter day when the air is thin, the water spiked with dew-like frost. Babe and I invented a game of chase where the idea is to make like you&#39;re going to catch a seagull, but just before it flies off you come to a sliding halt and see who can make the longest skid marks.
<P>   She won every time.
<P>   A 55-year-old woman with chalk-white legs who hadn&#39;t started her diet yet would never have the nerve to play games like that on a beach full of Barbies and Kens in their July play clothes.
<P>   And if the summertime crowd had been standing in line at all the restaurants, you&#39;d never find a waitress willing to add other people&#39;s leftovers to your doggie bag.

        <font size="5">W</font>hen the Greeks coined the word
        ''theology'' -- I wonder if they had in mind the
        bumper-sticker-T-shirt-push-button variety that seems the
        evangelism of choice for so many of us as we round the
        bases of the 20th century. </p>
        <p>It's been some 2,000 years since the Good News was
        decoded into two simple, first-grade, Scrabble-friendly
        words: </p>
        <p>Peace. Joy. </p>
        <p>Over the years that message has been studied,
        amplified, corrected, watered-down, jazzed up, revised,
        applied, scrubbed, polished and translated a thousand
        different ways. More has been written about it than any
        topic under the sun. Ironically enough, people fiercely
        disagree over what those two words mean -- words that by
        definition rule out all kinds of violence, even
        ideological violence. Be that as it may, dueling
        theologies have brought on more wars, caused more pain
        than any other single cause. </p>
        <p>For years Christianity was explained through creeds
        and doctrines. The going thing now seems to be a kind of
        shrink-art catechism. Especially in the South, these
        quick-and-quotable gospel lessons grow alongside the
        byways and highways of our spiritual journey like kudzu. </p>
        <p>In the past three weeks I've seen over a dozen
        cutsie-Christian quips posted on church marquees that
        years ago would have featured Bible verses and sermon
        topics and would have considered such trivializations a
        sacrilege. </p>
        <p>MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB AND NAMED IT JESUS . . . THE
        FIRST TWO LETTERS OF GOD ARE GO . . . I'VE UPPED MY
        CHURCH PLEDGE. UP YOURS. </p>
        <p>Recently I wandered into a ''Christian specialty
        shop'' in a South Carolina shopping mall. There were
        racks and racks of sweatshirts and jogging shorts, flags
        and stickers, salt and pepper shakers, hair barrettes,
        clip ties, scarves, shoe shine kits, a whole wall of
        coffee mugs, baby bibs and walking canes, bathroom mats,
        key chains, refrigerator magnets -- all of which put
        Jesus in a nutshell, so to speak. </p>
        <p>Like trying to play Handel's ''Messiah'' on the kazoo.
        </p>
        <p>Some of these souvenirs of salvation, as I think of
        them, were just silly. Like the license plate holder that
        said REAL MEN LOVE JESUS. DON'T LEAVE WITHOUT HIM. Or the
        skull-and-crossbones muscle shirt: Satan is a Poo-Poo
        Head -- an attempt, I gather, to put a born-again spin on
        those hateful hippie rags of the unwashed. </p>
        <p>There was a toy dinosaur that said, ''You think I'm
        big? You should see God.'' </p>
        <p>A replica of the Ford logo was stamped on a
        handkerchief: Have You Tried the Lord Lately? </p>
        <p>The T-shirts especially reeked with wacky writ. </p>
        <p>A throw-up green reptile wearing a smile: Iguana be
        more like Jesus. </p>
        <p>Another, white as snow except for a gory blob of blood
        spilled across the breast pocket: </p>
        <p>Just One Drop'll Save You. </p>
        <p>There were blue jeans with ragged holes in the knees, <b>PRAY
        HARD </b>stitched below the belt. <b>FBI &127;ACADEMY </b>baseball
        caps<b> </b>(Firm Believer In Jesus). A sports watch
        ticked out the warning, Life is Sudden Death &amp;
        Overtime. Time is running Out. </p>
        <p>Stuff like that you can almost laugh at, but some of
        it is serious trash. I could hardly believe, even seeing
        with my own eyes, the T-shirt available XXXXXS to XXXXXL
        that bore a brush-painting of the cross, a Post-It note
        stuck at its apex. Written in blood-stained, shaky
        cursive was the message: Gone to see Dad. We're fixin' a
        place for you. Be back soon to pick you up. Signed in
        splotchy red, Jesus. </p>
        <p>I find this kind of thing profoundly offensive, not
        because I am a non-believer, but because what I believe
        to be the power and glory of the Christian faith is
        bigger than a bread box, wider than a smiley-face and
        deeper than a 2-gallon fishers-of-men guppy tank. </p>
        <p>It smacks of heresy to downsize the New Testament into
        a Deere John 3:16 hunting cap or blow your nose into the
        Sermon on the Mount. </p>

<FONT SIZE="+2">R</FONT>amsey Clark, former U.S. attorney general, once told The New York Times that if Rosa Parks had not refused to move to the back of the bus, you and I might never had heard of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
<P>   The point Clark was making in the 1987 Times article was to emphasize the effectiveness of individual protest -- his hindsight take on the civil rights movement in general and Dr. King in particular, spoken some two decades after King&#39;s assassination.
<P>   But it wasn&#39;t Rosa Parks who introduced me to Dr. King. It was my father.
<P>   In the very early days of the civil rights movement, King came to Richmond to speak at what was then Virginia Union University, a black college whose campus was very near the campus of Union Theological Seminary, where my father was president. As part of the academic and religious community hosting Dr. King&#39;s visit, my father not only was on the podium but entertained him socially. That&#39;s when we met.
<P>   At the time King was relatively unknown. I&#39;m sure there were those among his ranks who realized from the start what a true, biblical-style prophet moved among us in those days and those who &#39;&#39;offered hospitality,&#39;&#39; as the Bible puts it, were entertaining angels unawares. But Clark is right in saying Rosa Parks&#39; bus ride was the cannon shot heard round the world. It turned the camera on Dr. King as he led an army of Christian soldiers brave enough to march &#39;&#39;as to war,&#39;&#39; carrying before them the cross of freedom and brotherhood.
<P>   Eventually King&#39;s weapons were mightier than sticks and stones, bullets and bombs, for -- to play off the words of the great hymn -- the gates of hell will never prevail against those who stand for peace, hope, charity. It would get worse before it would get better, as it often does, but in the long haul, time tends to unmask the villains and give heroes their honored place in history.
<P>   Martin Luther King Jr. was born Jan. 15, 1929. He would have been 68 years old today had he not been shot dead during the Memphis garbage worker&#39;s strike in April 1968 at age 39.
<P>   Had he lived I am sure he would be an advocate for those among us today who struggle for their rights, for freedom from prejudice and abuse, for fair treatment in the workplace, for decent housing and medical care, for a government that works towards peace, not only by standing up for what is right in the affairs and conflicts in other nations, but by taking sides with the underclass and mistreated here at home.
<P>   If you were a striking worker in Detroit or an unmarried mother trying to raise her children against all odds; a gay or lesbian couple seeking peace and financial harmony, granted the same civil and domestic rights you and I have in our legal partnerships; an immigrant trying to start a new life; a street person locked in the prison of mental illness; a woman seeking control over her own body; a child caught in the revolving door of abuse and abandonment -- if, in any one of a hundred different scenarios, you or I were standing on the outside of the circle in a democracy dedicated to securing your rights and protect your freedoms . . . imagine how these words of Dr. King&#39;s would sound to us today:
<P>   Success, recognition, and conformity are the bywords of the modern world where everyone seems to crave the anesthetizing security of being identified with the majority.
<P>   Discrimination is a hellhound that gnaws at (those discriminated against) every waking moment of their lives to remind them that the lie of their inferiority is accepted as truth in the society dominating them.
<P>   A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.
<P>   Power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice. Justice at its best is love correcting everything that stands against love.

        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">L</font>etting my fingers walk through the
        Knoxville Yellow Pages, I could not find the Church of
        Scientology anywhere in the 10-plus pages under CHURCHES.
        There are some 78 different denominations listed on pages
        248-258, between CHIROPRACTORS and CIGAR, but Church of
        Scientology wasn't among them. </p>
        <p>That would not be the case in the Hollywood phone book
        because Scientology is the denomination of choice among a
        growing number of the stars. </p>
        <p>I did find a reference to ''scientologists'' on page
        910 of the Knoxville directory, referring me to
        ''non-denominational churches,'' but even after making
        several calls to churches in that section I thought might
        perhaps be related to the Church of Scientology, I struck
        out. My hunches tell me there must be some Scientologists
        in the area, I would appreciate hearing from them. </p>
        <p>After all, this is the Bible belt. </p>
        <p>But that might also explain why the Scientologists are
        so scarce in these parts. It's not compatible with
        mainline Christianity for a variety of reasons. In fact
        the Church of Scientology is making the headlines these
        days in Germany where the government and other critics
        are fearful its members are being brainwashed into taking
        over the government. </p>
        <p>Remembering what happened when the Nazi ideology got
        out of control, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his government
        are cracking down on the Scientologists who, according to
        a recent Newsweek article, claim 8 million members
        worldwide -- 30,000 of whom are German. In November of
        last year, the state of Bavaria decreed Scientologists
        ineligible to serve as public employees. This past
        summer, Kohl's Christian Democratic Union tried to
        boycott the movie ''Mission Impossible'' because its
        star, Tom Cruise, is a Scientologist. </p>
        <p>In response to what they see as ''organized
        persecution,'' 34 non-Scientologists from Hollywood --
        including Goldie Hawn, Dustin Hoffman and Oliver Stone --
        sent an open letter to Chancellor Kohl in last week's
        International Herald Tribune which said, in part: ''In
        the 1930s it was the Jews. Today it is the
        Scientologists.'' </p>
        <p>Kohl's response? </p>
        <p>''They don't know anything about Germany, and they
        don't want to, either. Otherwise they wouldn't have
        talked such rubbish.'' </p>
        <p>Years ago I had a friend try to convert me, witnessing
        to the merits and wisdom of Scientology, but I never got
        beyond the first tenet. It is, as I understand, a
        religion without a god, which to me is an oxymoron. I
        admit, when it comes to religion it is hard to find
        non-biased explanations and definitions, but the Church
        of Scientology is more controversial than most and
        therefore harder to understand from the outside. </p>
        <p>Maybe it's just a matter of semantics, but though it
        calls itself a ''church,'' it is not listed as such in
        the encyclopedia. World Book says to look under ''cult,''
        where it is thrown in among the estimated 3,000 different
        religious groups devoted to (1) a living leader (2) a new
        teaching or (3) an unusual practice -- the Jim Jones mass
        suicide crowd, the Hare Krishnas and the Moonies serving
        as specific examples of cults. </p>
        <p>The Church of Scientology was founded in the 1950s by
        a then-living leader to whom its members ''devoted''
        themselves. L. Ron Hubbard, a science fiction writer who
        died 10 years ago, preached spiritual growth through a
        regimen of expensive self-improvement courses, and it is
        around his principles that the church was formed.
        Scientology arguably fits the definition of cult in its
        insistence that psychic scars can be healed by using a
        simple lie detector called an ''E-meter'' and that our
        thinking should be controlled by a process called ''going
        clear.'' </p>
        <p>It all sounds puzzling to me, strange and not very
        ''churchy'' as I understand the word -- but I'll go along
        with what Oliver Stone told reporters about why he signed
        the protest: </p>
        <p>''You may not agree with them. I certainly don't. But
        they have a right to do what they do.'' </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        <p><font size="2"><i>By Ina Hughs News-Sentinel Columnist</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>he other night a bunch of local
        writers from the Knoxville Writers Guild were talking and
        someone pointed out how several News-Sentinel columnists
        had written recently on the same subject -- namely, how
        and why and what they do. ''The craft of writing,'' as it
        is sometimes called. </p>
        <p>And it's true. </p>
        <p>David Hunter, Don Williams, Harold Julian and Wilma
        Dykeman have all done personal pieces about writing in
        general and/or how they go about selecting and
        pasteurizing their ideas into print. </p>
        <p>I have enjoyed these columns, and my guess is their
        readers have, too. We all wish we could be as sensitive
        as Hunter, as scholarly as Williams, as easy-to-read as
        Dykeman and as nice a guy as Julian. </p>
        <p>Folks in charge of the University of Tennessee's
        Non-Credit programs tell me that writing classes are
        among the first to fill up. People are reviving the art
        of storytelling. We realize more and more how important
        memory is, and that its survival -- and therefore ours as
        a person, a family, a culture -- depends on making that
        voyage from out of the head and onto the page. </p>
        <p>Computers have taken the drudgery -- well, some of it
        -- out of getting our stories and our thoughts written
        out. As someone once put it, ''I love to write. It's the
        paperwork I can't stand.'' </p>
        <p>Word processors make our brains more user-friendly. </p>
        <p>My philosophy about writing in general and my writing
        in particular is pretty simple: </p>
        <p>To you I give my stories. From you I would like your
        story so that together we can know our story. Because it
        is only by sharing our stories that we will ever
        understand the story. </p>
        <p>A little grandiose and touchy-feely, I realize, but
        it's a serious (and impossible) responsibility to come up
        with words worth reading three times a week, rain or
        shine. </p>
        <p>It gives me the willies just to think about what
        Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Edna Buchanan said
        about writing for a newspaper: ''The best day is when I
        can write a lead that will cause a reader at his
        breakfast table the next morning to spit up his coffee,
        clutch his heart and shout, 'My God! Martha, did you read
        this?' . . . '' </p>
        <p>But if the truth be known -- columnists get more
        sympathy than they deserve. We just get paid for doing
        what you do all day: think, talk, replay something that
        happened, blow off steam, tell a joke, recall a story,
        pass on information, revisit an event, gossip, beg, pray,
        improvise, shoot off our mouth, brag on our kids, play
        politics, sidewalk supervise, complain, critique, make
        fools of ourselves, think out loud . . . </p>
        <p>Instead of doing it around the water fountain or in
        the den recliner, we do it at our desks on deadline. And
        we have to spell it correctly. </p>
        <p>Although I have to admit: In my darker moments, I
        think of columnists as people who sit down at the
        computer and open a vein -- a thought, by the way, which
        is not original. I just forgot which writer said it. </p>
        <p>For me the worst occupational hazard I face is having
        anyone think I see myself as having special insights or
        to assume that the windows of my mind are slammed shut as
        soon as I form an opinion or finish my spiel. To me the
        most important tool a columnist has is not her computer
        or her press releases or even her mind. It's her heart. </p>
        <p>O.K. Enough of that. </p>
        <p>Which brings me to the only other point I want to make
        in this navel-gazing exercise. </p>
        <p>Deadline writing for a newspaper has its advantages.
        If you write something good, you can't get too excited or
        carried away because you have to do it again the next
        day. If you write something not-so-good, you needn't jump
        off a cliff or wear a bag over your head because you get
        another chance. Real soon. </p>
        <p>Either way, you can't take yourself too seriously
        because, good or bad, everyone wraps up their garbage in
        it anyway. </p>
        <p>O.K., Sam. Your turn. </p>

        <font size="5">Y</font>es, Virginia, there is a Santa
        Claus. </p>
        <p>But, no. There's no such thing as snow. </p>
        <p>At least as predicted by weather people. </p>
        <p>Snow is just a figment of our imagination. A rumor. It
        starts out with someone checking barometric pressures and
        cloud mergers who whispers ''possibility'' under his
        breath . . . and by the time that Little Red Engine gets
        up the hill, it not only thinks it can, there are 6 to 12
        inches on the way. TV cameras rush to film gullible
        masses body-slamming into grocery stores for Duraflame
        logs and sandwich bread. People leave work to rush home
        and run a tub of water, and everything from bowling
        parties to birthings scheduled within the next 10 days
        goes to Plan B. </p>
        <p>If faith is defined as a sure belief in things not
        seen, snow is a kind of religion here in East Tennessee.
        Other than mountaintop experiences, we have little to go
        on besides optimism. </p>
        <p>Most of us around here are more familiar with the kind
        of snow you get on an old Motorola or buy in a cone at
        the beach. Maybe that's why we go bonkers at the mere
        mention of the word. </p>
        <p>Especially when coupled with ''possibility.'' </p>
        <p>All my life I have been a snow atheist. Even as a kid
        when I'd get my hopes up and my sled out, underneath it
        all I was filled with doubt. Usually justified. Only once
        do I remember a white Christmas, and wouldn't you know. </p>
        <p>I was in bed with bronchitis. </p>
        <p>This week when we got the Chicken Little chatter about
        mountains of snow up there overhead about to fall on us,
        I just shrugged and went on about my business. The
        children were quick to remind me how I stood at the
        window and laughed the night of the Blizzard of '93.
        Hours later it started, and we didn't leave the house for
        four days. I'd bah-humbugged the idea of stocking up on
        matches, milk, toilet paper, aspirin. Or to pull the long
        underwear out of the attic. It was March, for Pete's
        sake. Besides, there was plenty of canned food. </p>
        <p>As it turned out we had no food which didn't require
        technology, and tempers run short after two meals of
        low-fat Doritos and little boxes of raisins. We lost
        electricity, heat, water, lights and, before it was over,
        our minds. </p>
        <p>This week when the snow rumors started, I got six
        messages on my answering machine asking if I was
        prepared. Friends were worried. I live in the country.
        There are exposed pipes and steep driveways. We're on a
        first-name basis with emergency crews from Alcoa because
        limbs on trees out here have expert marksmanship when it
        comes to utility poles and rooftops. </p>
        <p>But even though I don't believe in snow, I'm ready for
        its coming. This is the first winter I ever owned a
        truck, a 4-wheel-drive of my very own. So I have to
        admit. I had my hopes up. Only once have I driven my
        truck ''off road,'' and that was by mistake, playing
        bumper cars through the Cedar Bluff/Truckers
        Lane/Pellissippi Parkway obstacle course and ending up
        beside a bulldozer in a pile of gravel. </p>
        <p>I asked my daughter to stay over the night of the
        supposed first-coming snowfall of the year. We'd build a
        fire and play Christmas music. Chestnuts roasting on an
        open fire and Jack Frost nipping at your nose are
        concepts hard to get worked up over when the temperature
        is in the 60s and we're all tugging at our turtlenecks,
        itching inside Christmas sweaters. </p>
        <p>Next morning, we woke up to the brown winter woodland,
        bare as undriven snow. The only ''winter wonderland''
        thing about it was how, once again, I wondered why I'd
        even half expected sleigh bells and snowdrifts. </p>
        <p>I knew better. </p>
        <p>Now, mind you, as I write this, there are still rumors
        of snow wars in the air. Twice today I've heard that
        possibility word, the word which seems to be the
        call-to-worship for the snow-falling faithful. If it does
        snow, my 4-wheel invites your 4-wheel over for a romp in
        the snow. </p>
        <p>I'll be inside by the fire. Eating crow. </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        <p><font size="2"><i>By Ina Hughs News-Sentinel Columnist</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">I</font> ran into some old friends the
        other day in the bookstore. You probably know them, too. </p>
        <p>They have no last name, but were the middle-class,
        American Dream family in schools across the country:
        Father, Mother, a first-born son named, I suppose,
        Richard, Jr. </p>
        <p>Dick for short. </p>
        <p>Next came Jane, then baby Sally. There was a cocker
        spaniel, a yellow cat and a set of visiting grandparents
        who both wore glasses. </p>
        <p>We saw Spot run in the house carrying the evening
        newspaper in his never-drooling mouth, and Mother handing
        Father his slippers, but the world outside never
        interrupted the Dick and Jane family's domestic
        adventures. No stock market crash. No Holocaust. No
        polio. No Korean War. No Sputniks, Edsels or civil-rights
        marches. No Betty Friedan. </p>
        <p><b>Look at Father:</b> He looks, come to think of it,
        like an over-the-hill Ken. Maybe Ken is his great
        grandson. Father wore a three-piece suit and a fedora,
        except on weekends when he raked leaves in a V-neck. He
        drove a hunched sedan the color of Elvis' carpet at
        Graceland, but as the family grew, he bought a
        zippidy-doo-dah blue wagon that, compared to today's Jeep
        Cherokee, looked like an ocean liner. </p>
        <p><b>I see Mother:</b> Never ''Mom'' or ''Mama'' --
        which sounded fishy at first because calling your mama
        ''Mother'' where I came from was as unthinkable as
        calling her by her first name. A mother was a noun, not a
        person. But after a few turns around the Red Robin
        Reading Group, the name suited. She was the Mother of all
        mothers. The only difference between her and the sacred
        version was that she had blond hair. Maybe that's what
        made her even more a middle-class white icon than Harriet
        Nelson, Donna Reed or June Cleaver. They had dark hair.
        Mother was a day-glow blond, Marilyn Monroe in an A-cup
        and apron. </p>
        <p>Her voice, of course, sounded altogether different
        from Marilyn Monroe's since all her speaking parts were
        stammered out phonetically by readers yet unskilled in
        the nuance of speech and more into pleasing the teacher
        than following plot or getting into literary criticism.
        It didn't matter what any of them did as long as you
        pronounced it properly. </p>
        <p>This mother had no first name, which seemed logical to
        me at the time, but I'm glad to say is something my
        daughters would definitely have picked up on when they
        were in the first grade. They'd also have asked a bunch
        of embarrassing questions about how come Dick and Jane's
        mother was so different from theirs. Mother carried
        pocketbooks for every outfit, didn't own a single jogging
        suit, never whipped out a Mrs. Paul's fish stick and a
        side of (canned) applesauce for dinner, and never, no
        never, did Mother furrow her brows. </p>
        <p><b>Mother sews</b> . . . <b>Mother knits</b> . . . <b>See
        &127;Mother pet Puff:</b> My daughters never saw their
        mother sew, and for me to muster the patience to knit,
        I'd have to be on Valium. We didn't allow cats in our
        house, but if we had, we'd never have named one Puff. </p>
        <p>I don't remember Dick and Jane doing anything very
        exciting. All they did was run and jump. Too bad they
        never came home after school with me. I'd have shown them
        what fun was: water balloon fights, spying on the
        sixth-graders smoking behind the drugstore, crank-calling
        folks and asking if they had Prince Albert in a can. </p>
        <p>My favorite member of the family was Sally, because
        when I was in the first grade, my sister Anne was born.
        By the time I advanced beyond one-syllable words in Dick
        and Jane's world, Anne looked just like curly-headed baby
        Sally, down to her high-top white shoes. </p>
        <p>That's why this Christmas I'm sending Anne, now a
        physician in California with a grown Jane and Sally of
        her own, a copy of the new behind-the-scenes story of
        ''Growing Up with Dick and Jane'' by Carole Kismaric and
        Marvin Heiferman. It's everything we never wondered, but
        still have fun reading about. </p>
        <p>Old pals should get in touch at Christmas. </p>

        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">Y</font>ou probably noticed during your
        Christmas shopping that there has been a population
        explosion among angels. They're everywhere, and it's not
        just a seasonal thing. People wear them in their lapels,
        use them as bookends, have them inscribed on oven mitts
        and hair clips. I even found a bag of angel pasta. </p>
        <p>In Biblical times, angels were more like messengers
        than decorations or guardians -- a kind of heavenly
        Western Union delivery person, announcing important
        information, bringing a warning, or explaining an earthly
        event. For centuries the Judeo-Christian tradition
        depended on angels, earthly and otherwise, to get the
        story out. Oral tradition carried the faith from one
        generation to the next, saints and angels being those who
        led the troops either by sacrifice or example. </p>
        <p>As time went on, that explosive message first sung by
        angels to a handful of shepherds got sent over radio
        wires, made into movies and televised via satellite for
        all the world to see. </p>
        <p>But no medium -- angels included -- has matched what
        the computer is doing to ''spread the word.'' Computer
        evangelism has impacted personal faith and theology in a
        way nothing else has in all the years since religion
        first met technology five centuries ago as Sumerians,
        seeking a better way to organize and preserve the
        spiritual underpinnings of their lives, began etching
        their hopes and fears in cuneiform. </p>
        <p>Between Nov. 25 and Dec. 9 of this year, Christianity
        Online -- one of thousands of sites dedicated to the
        Christmas faith -- did a random survey among 1,153 of its
        subscribers. Over 55 percent of those surveyed said they
        had shared their religious beliefs with someone they
        didn't know, either by chatting online with them or by
        sending them e-mail. Over 63 percent said their own
        spiritual life had been enriched by online experiences. </p>
        <p>Ninety-three percent were interested in forming
        evangelistic teams to witness in other chat areas
        throughout the Internet. </p>
        <p>According to a study done by Time magazine, among the
        most popular sites found in this ''high-speed spiritual
        bazaar'' are newsgroups like <a
        href="news:alt.fan.jesus-christ"><b>alt.fan.jesus-christ</b></a>
        and <a href="news:alt.religion.scientology"><b>alt.religion.scientology</b></a>
        -- although the sky is almost literally the limit. There
        are over 20,000 such groups offered on Usenet alone. </p>
        <p>Even the technophobic Amish are online. </p>
        <p>The example Time gives for topics tackled in these
        ''religious'' chat rooms is this AOL query recently up
        for discussion: </p>
        <p>Is it OK to have a pot-bellied pig as a pet if you
        keep a kosher kitchen? </p>
        <p>The answer? Probably. As long as you don't plan to eat
        it. </p>
        <p>My own ''epiphanies'' on the Internet have been less
        humorous but certainly more thought-provoking. I find it
        encouraging that there are a lot of people who, with the
        anonymity allowed in cyberspace's great ''cathedral of
        the mind,'' are daring to question reality as we know it,
        to be less interested in settling old scores than finding
        new insight. Sometimes I have to remind myself of that
        balance, especially when I come across the rabid anti's
        who use as a disguise for bigotry a foam-at-the-mouth God
        whose rules are everything but Golden. </p>
        <p>But then there was the Christmas letter I got ''from
        Jesus'' -- by way of a 14-year-old boy in one of the
        religious chat rooms two days before Christmas. In the
        letter Jesus tells this story: </p>
        <p>One day he sees a man sitting on the steps of a very
        exclusive church, head in hands. Jesus asks him what's
        the matter and he says the folks inside turned him away
        because they didn't think he was good enough, didn't wear
        the right clothes, have the right manners, couldn't
        conform to their lifestyle and social outlook. </p>
        <p>Jesus puts his arms around the fellow and says, ''Hey.
        I know just how you feel. I've been waiting to get inside
        that same church for years, and they won't let me in
        either.'' </p>

        <font size="5">A</font> hand-written note posted
        Christmas Eve on the drive-through window at an Alcoa
        Highway Hardee's is, indeed, a sign of the times. It
        reads: ''I'VE GOT TICKLE ME ELMO. WILL SELL FOR THE RIGHT
        PRICE.'' </p>
        <p>''The right price,'' we found out in news stories
        documenting the lengths to which parents will go to do
        Santa right, is way over budget. </p>
        <p>The scroungy little doll even made prime time news
        Christmas Eve when a local children's agency sent out a
        bulletin that they had three Elmos they'd give to the
        highest bidder. That way you could make more than your
        own child happy by forking over a month's worth of
        grocery money for the hottest toy of the season. </p>
        <p>It's easy to get sanctimonious and preachy about this
        kind of thing, especially when your kids are grown and
        the things on their wish list are more cost-effective
        than a stuffed doll that giggles on cue. Grown children
        at least have sense enough to know people don't,
        shouldn't, can't and mustn't come to expect to get
        everything they want -- even at Christmas. </p>
        <p>Still, most parents want to make it happen on
        Christmas morning, especially for the little ones. I've
        certainly gone to outrageous extremes to find the perfect
        toy -- walking the streets and spending hours on the
        phone hunting down a Nerf bow and arrow set, a Star Wars
        R2D2, a Mrs. Beasley doll. I once made a zillion
        whiney-voice phone calls in search of a REAL cash
        register for a budding 5-year-old merchant who put it at
        the top of her list. She didn't get it, although I did
        eventually find one in a Danville, Va., warehouse, but
        they wanted $200 cash upfront, plus $100 for shipping. </p>
        <p>Maybe Tickle Me Elmo has inner beauty. People
        shouldn't be judged by their looks, we tell our children,
        so it stands to reason animal things shouldn't either.
        I've never actually played with Elmo, giggle for giggle,
        but he/she certainly doesn't have a lot of charisma on
        first glance. </p>
        <p>But then, neither did the Cabbage Patch dolls, which
        may still set the record for Christmas mania. They have a
        face only a mother could love. If your neighbor came home
        from the hospital showing off a new baby that actually
        looked like a Cabbage Patch newborn, it would be hard not
        to laugh. When time came to do the cute-baby ooohs and
        ahhhhs, we'd have to lie -- else we'd be saying, ''Lord,
        that's one pitiful-looking creature you got there in your
        bassinet.'' </p>
        <p>I once visited the headquarters where Cabbage Patch
        babies are born. It was one of the strangest experiences
        I've ever had, and I love babies. All kinds of babies.
        But what they pulled up out of the cabbage patch made me
        want to protest to the March of Dimes, or write a letter
        to Dr. Spock. The salespeople were dressed like
        obstetricians and used forceps to ''deliver'' the babies
        from a fake row of cabbages. </p>
        <p>Thank goodness my girls never put one of them on their
        list. It would have been a hard call. </p>
        <p>If this year's ''girl toy'' has us scratching our
        heads over the wonders of marketing, this year's ''boy
        toy'' is equally as nonplussing. Mario, Nintendo's pudgy
        little plumber, had folks scalping and hoarding
        Cabbage-Patch style this Christmas on the other side of
        the gender-toy gap. At $200 a pop, the Japanese-made
        Mario 64 game was a money-wise investment for elves
        looking for a quick buck. </p>
        <p>I can't remember a toy I would die for in my
        childhood. But I didn't play with dolls, and computer
        games hadn't yet been pulled from the cabbage patch of
        the mind. Other than Mickey Mouse watches, Duncan yo-yos
        and Flexie Flyers, I can't even remember brand names. Mr.
        Potato Head and Silly Putty were popular, but were
        neither scarce nor expensive -- and it's my theory that
        Betty Boop, Lincoln Logs, Lone Ranger lunch boxes and
        Curious George are more popular in their nostalgic
        reincarnations than they ever were in their own lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>Can you imagine what a Dick Tracy crime-fighter watch
        would cost today? </p>
        <p>(If you know where I can get one, let me know. We'll
        talk.) </p>

        <font size="5">M</font>ost churches and civic
        organizations set aside a moment during this season to
        celebrate the lives of members who died in the past year.
        </p>
        <p>This roll call of individuals for whom 1996 marked the
        end of one journey and the beginning of another reminds
        us how varied those footprints are we humans can leave in
        the sands of time. </p>
        <p>It would be impossible to name all the leaders and
        role models we as a nation lost this past year -- in
        sports and business, entertainment and the arts, religion
        and politics, science and medicine -- but here are a few
        I owe something to. </p>
        <p>I don't think I ever missed a Gene Kelly movie, an
        Erma Bombeck column or a George Burns joke. </p>
        <p>Edmund Muskie proved to me how real men do cry, but
        it's a terrible liability if they are running for office.
        </p>
        <p>Timothy Leary fascinated me in the same way Tiny Tim
        did, though their side-show antics were poles apart in
        both effect and affect. </p>
        <p>Greg Morris was my favorite character on the old
        ''Mission Impossible'' series which I all but arranged my
        week around in those days. </p>
        <p>There have been few television programs to which I
        have been as loyal, but another was ''Ben Casey,'' the
        program for us back in college. </p>
        <p>There was only one married classmate in our crowd and
        she lived off campus. On ''Ben Casey'' night, we'd pile
        into an old VW Beetle, pick up a pizza and head for her
        apartment to watch Vince Edwards, our heartthrob surgeon
        . . . sensitive, shy, needy, great eyes. </p>
        <p>Even when he performed complicated surgery or pulled
        bodies from train wrecks, he never got a spot of blood or
        sweaty underarms on his hospital whites. It's too bad
        this television physician couldn't heal himself of the
        cancer that took his life at age 67. </p>
        <p>P.L. Travers. Jerry Siegel. Margret E. Rey. </p>
        <p>These names might not mean anything, but unless you
        grew up in another galaxy, Mary Poppins, Superman and
        Curious George are old pals. Thank goodness they are
        still with us, but their creators died this past year. </p>
        <p>Travers, who was 96, said Mary Poppins just popped out
        of her head one day in her writing. She hadn't set out to
        write children's books. </p>
        <p>Siegel was a teenager during the Depression when he
        created his Superman comic super-hero. </p>
        <p>Curious George is the only two-parent brain child in
        the bunch. He was born when Margret E. Rey and her
        husband H.A. Rey put their heads together and came up
        with some very successful, albeit stuffy, monkey
        business. </p>
        <p>Women certainly lost some of our long-suffering and
        talented icons. </p>
        <p>Barbara Jordon led women of all color in the fight for
        justice and integrity, though she was probably best known
        for her voice of inspiration during the Watergate
        scandal. </p>
        <p>Minnie Pearl and I once shared a table at a dinner
        party, and although I wasn't into country music at the
        time, I knew I was in the company of an angel. She was
        one of the most gracious and charming ladies I have ever
        met. </p>
        <p>Mary Leakey, whom some say was the real brains behind
        the Leakey twosome's scholarly breakthrough in
        anthropology, died at 83. </p>
        <p>Roger Tory Peterson still tags along inside my
        backpack when I go on hikes and bird walks, and I bet
        he's busy writing a new set of guidebooks on the birds of
        Paradise now that his job on earth is done. </p>
        <p>Hunters could learn a few things from him, I might
        add. Like how much more skill and sport it takes to
        photograph or sketch birds up close than to hide in the
        bushes and blast them to bits. </p>
        <p>I didn't know Alvin Straight, who died of a heart
        attack last year, but I'll not forget this story picked
        up by wire services at his death. </p>
        <p>In 1994, at age 76, Straight had lost his license to
        drive a car because of failing eyesight. When word came
        that his brother was seriously ill, Straight climbed on
        his John Deere lawn mower and drove 240 miles from Sioux
        City, Iowa, to Blue River, Wis., to be at his brother's
        bedside. </p>
        <p>Who says family values died in 1996? </p>

        <font size="5">Y</font>ears ago if someone said they'd
        made their fortune in the underwear business, folks would
        have assumed it meant the person manufactured bloomers or
        long johns. </p>
        <p>But 21-year-old Jeremy Shore -- a former Bearden High
        School student now in his senior year at Queens College
        in Charlotte, N.C. -- has nothing to do with the making
        or manufacturing of underwear, yet found a pot of gold in
        his . . . well . . . in his britches. </p>
        <p>His rags-to-riches story ran in last Thursday's
        News-Sentinel: how his mom came across an application for
        the underwear modeling contest sponsored by Structure, a
        men's clothing chain with a store in West Town Mall. The
        long and short of it is that Jeremy beat out 12,000 other
        applicants to became one of 20 finalists. Though he did
        not win the overall competition in Los Angeles, his
        success put him on the path to becoming a for-real model
        after graduation. </p>
        <p>I have an elderly friend -- actually it's my mother,
        but I really shouldn't talk about underwear and my mother
        in the same sentence; you'll see why in just a minute --
        anyway, this friend refuses to shop at the large
        department store in her town because they place obscene
        ads in the newspaper. Full page ads, with women in their
        bras and panties and men in skimpy Jockey shorts. </p>
        <p>''It's revolting,'' she says in that tone of voice,
        that certain inflection and body language only a real
        Southern lady can bring off. </p>
        <p>''People have NO MORALS. </p>
        <p>''It didn't used to be that way,'' she goes on. ''I
        used to buy all my hats and bed jackets from them, but I
        wouldn't buy a handkerchief from that store today. Not
        when they pay to put people in their underwear all over
        the newspapers. On Sunday'' -- which she is sure to
        remind us is the Lord's Day and makes it worse -- ''the
        ads are in color!'' </p>
        <p>I don't know if this ''friend'' of mine would loosen
        up a little if there'd been an opportunity for her
        grandson to win $100,000 and a swell wardrobe, not to
        mention taking the worry out of what he was going to do
        when he began supporting himself. Maybe she would have
        done what most of us do in judgment situations when the
        shoe comes off someone else's foot and gets slipped onto
        ours. </p>
        <p>As for Jeremy and his family, I liked their attitude.
        His mother is proud. His grandfather volunteered to take
        the required ''skivvy'' photo to accompany the
        application, and (here's the part I really like) Jeremy
        says the only bad thing about that first down-to-basics
        photo session with his grandfather was that his
        grandmother kept trying to come into the room. Which
        implies, at least to me, that his grandmother and my
        mother may have shopped for their Sunday hats at the same
        gone-to-the-dogs store. </p>
        <p>But my favorite comment Jeremy made was in describing
        the hoopla over underwear models in the first place. He
        had no idea it was such a big-money, knock-down-drag-out
        deal. </p>
        <p>''I was just like -- this is crazy -- it's a different
        world.'' </p>
        <p>And it started getting different long before this.
        Years ago, when the girls-wearing-dad's-boxer-shorts
        craze had gone on long enough that old sticks-in-the-mud
        like us finally gave in, we took our daughter and a
        couple of her friends to the beach for the weekend. You
        know what that means. </p>
        <p>They borrowed each other's clothes, swapping outfits
        back and forth all day long, sometimes searching their
        parents' drawers for variety or weirdness since one of
        the rules of teenage girldom is that you can never wear
        the same outfit twice. </p>
        <p>One morning when our daughter and her friends came
        down in their eat-cereal attire, her dad turned to me and
        whispered, ''Who would've thought I'd ever see some
        little girl -- whose father is a very close friend and
        the clerk of session in my church -- come down to
        breakfast in my underwear?'' </p>

            <FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n the late 1970s I watched my uncle die in agony from kidney failure.
<P>    I asked the doctor why he couldn&#39;t be given larger doses of painkiller to ease his last hours. The doctor told me that my uncle would develop a tolerance and the morphine would become ineffective when he really needed it. That wasn&#39;t true, but that&#39;s what he had been taught.
<P>    Now the medical community knows that most pain can be alleviated. If they keep up with the literature, today&#39;s doctors also are aware that addiction to opiates rarely occurs when people are suffering.
<P>    Things should be better for those in pain; but they&#39;re not. The deep-rooted, medical bogeyman of addiction has been replaced by very real meddling from the federal government, protecting us from medication that can be bought over the counter in many countries.
<P>    Last summer, I suffered a whiplash while giving a driving lesson when my student threw the car into park while it was still moving. I was really hurting. When I found my regular doctor&#39;s office packed, I drove on to a walk-in clinic.
<P>    During my police career, I was kicked, punched, stomped and pounded so often that I lost track of the number of visits to emergency rooms, but it wasn&#39;t until I injured an Achilles tendon in 1994 that I ever (except for chest surgery and dental work) asked for or was prescribed any type of narcotic pain-killer.
<P>    This time, I expected compassion from the clinic doctor, who knew me from my cop days. Hippocratic oath, you know.
<P>    It didn&#39;t happen, though. I spent 3 nights in severe pain because the doctor was unwilling to prescribe anything strong enough to alleviate the spasms and aching. I left his office feeling like a street addict who had sneaked in for a fix. I wasn&#39;t up to risking further humiliation from another doctor.
<P>    I suspect (and sincerely hope) that the doctor withheld medication because he feared scrutiny from over-zealous narcotics investigators. Who knows? Maybe he even thought I was investigating him. It&#39;s tragic that just as doctors began to understand pain management, federal agents, joined by a few state and local law enforcement agencies, decided to start practicing medicine.
<P>    Going after doctors with some arcane formula about how much they ought to be prescribing is like shooting fish in a barrel. And it&#39;s like accusing someone of child molesting; the stigma hangs around.
<P>    Are there addicts who abuse the system? Absolutely. Are there doctors who act as willing conduits for narcotics? Without a doubt.
<P>    But abuse of the system by the few is not reason enough for a single human being to suffer needlessly, even for a moment.
<P>    In America we believe that it is better for the guilty to go free than for the innocent to be punished. Yet doctors are often faced with the choice of turning their backs on suffering or risking the attention of over-zealous law enforcement agencies looking for headlines.
<P>    I am indignant and angry about the situation. Constitutional issues aside, I get older every day, which means I don&#39;t heal quickly. And I&#39;m no longer willing to grit my teeth and suffer in macho silence.
<P>    If you haven&#39;t heard, President Clinton has just ordered the Justice Department to work even harder to save poor, ignorant patients from their physicians.
<P>    If Big Brother has his way, your doctor may soon have to get permission to write a prescription to ease your pain.
<P>    Think about it, then scream a loud and clear message to your elected representative. Fear of losing an election is the only thing that moves professional politicians.

		<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><P>
<P>There are probably plenty of reasons why they don&#39;t let journalists negotiate peace treaties and things like that.
<P>    I know I&#39;ll never try. I&#39;m sure I&#39;d create some kind of ugly international incident. I almost did a few weeks ago.
<P>    That&#39;s when I was host to a Russian TV crew from Tomsk.
<P>    Tomsk is one of those walled cities once devoted to secret work for the Soviet Union&#39;s nuclear weapons program. Clearly, there are elements of Tomsk common to Oak Ridge, itself an atomic city, although I&#39;m sure there are many differences as well.
<P>    Anyway, unlike the Cold War years, Russian visitors are a common feature in Oak Ridge these days. There are cultural and scientific exchanges, and there is a special interest in sharing technologies on how to best protect the stockpile of weapons-making materials.
<P>    The Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant is the U.S. repository for bomb-grade uranium. As such, it has particular capabilities in uranium handling.
<P>    Viktor Loysha, a TV producer in Tomsk, was accompanied by a cameraman -- whose name I never quite got -- and an interpreter, Julya Mikhaleva, whose business card identified her as being from the Russian Federation Ministry of Nuclear Power.
<P>    They were escorted by Howard Kerr, a state legislator and Oak Ridge National Lab nuke engineer who has had a long interest in developing nuclear projects abroad.
<P>    The meeting started off cordially enough, with introductions, chit-chat and so forth. It was informal, even though the discussion was videotaped.
<P>    I wasn&#39;t sure what kind of information Loysha wanted, but talk soon turned to nuclear topics and news coverage of them.
<P>    All conversation was being funneled through the interpreter. I don&#39;t speak Russian. And, if Loysha speaks English, he didn&#39;t display it that day.
<P>    He seemed interested mostly in my opinions, not so much facts and background. He wanted to know what I thought about Greens -- environmentalists -- and other groups.
<P>    I didn&#39;t think that was particularly unusual because my impression is that Russian journalists more often are advocates than their U.S. counterparts.
<P>    Loysha, however, didn&#39;t seem enthralled with my responses, and I figured that was because they were too bland. I tried to explain that my relationship with many news sources was just a professional thing, that&#39;s all, without much of an opinion basis.
<P>    His TV program, by the way, is titled &#39;&#39;The Apple of Discord,&#39;&#39; and it is billed as &#39;&#39;The unique everyweek program about problems of nuclear power.&#39;&#39;
<P>    He was curious about news coverage of the nuclear weapons plant in Oak Ridge, and I told him not much had changed since the end of the Cold War.  I told him it was difficult to visit the Y-12 weapons plant, noting that areas where workers produce nuclear warheads or store deposits of enriched uranium are off limits. 
<P>    That seemed to spark a special interest. Loysha&#39;s voice rose a notch, and he began a discourse that took a while to say and even longer to translate. His response, as translated, had a boastful tone. Loysha said he had seen everything there was to see in the Russian weapons program. He said he&#39;d looked at warheads and had held enriched uranium in his hand.
<P>    I was impressed and told him so. After a question, he clarified his statement and said he had seen everything except the operation where nuclear warheads are assembled. I was still impressed.
<P>    He asked me about nuclear security, and my response was not well received. I told him it was my perception that the United States had the best safeguards and security for nuclear materials in the world. I also noted the general concern, often expressed here, that protection of nuclear resources might be inconsistent following the breakup of the Soviet Union.
<P>    Loysha offered a couple of responses, neither of which were clear in translation. One seemed to say Russian security was as good as any. The other seemed to blame the Ukraine for any problems.
<P>    I was having doubts about the level of communication taking place, and he seemed to grow more agitated with each topic. His voice was louder, and his body language told me he wasn&#39;t happy.
<P>    As time for the interview neared an end, he asked about the economy. I told him it was a difficult time for Oak Ridge, with hundreds of people losing their jobs. He asked a question, which came translated as, &#39;&#39;How many publications cover this?&#39;&#39;
<P>    I stumbled with the wording, as I had with other questions. I didn&#39;t know what he meant. Publications?
<P>    &#39;&#39;Local or national?&#39;&#39; I asked.
<P>    When the translator returned the question, Loysha became enraged. He stood up and shouted something.
<P>    I was baffled, not sure what to say. As it turns out, he apparently wanted to know how many stories I had written on layoffs, but I couldn&#39;t figure that out at the time.
<P>    Anyway, Ms. Mikhaleva, the translator, turned to me in desperation. &#39;&#39;Please,&#39;&#39; she implored, &#39;&#39;tell me something or I am in serious trouble.&#39;&#39;
<P>    It was too late. She burst into big tears, the result of a Siberian tongue-lashing. Loysha and his cameraman gave only the briefest of salutations before turning sharply and leaving the office.
<P>    Kerr tried to console Mikhaleva, offering her a hanky. Then they left, too, and I was left to ponder the meaning of it all.
<P>    I&#39;m still working on that.

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->        <font size="5">I</font>'ve been out on the World Wide
        Web. </p>
        <p>After three years of having had access to the
        electronic highway, I finally went down some back roads.
        Not all of those roads lead to the city of Oz. </p>
        <p>For the most part, I had limited myself to a browsing
        program; you type in a subject or associated word, and
        the browser hunts down references. For instance, when I
        was working on a column about pain, there were over
        240,000 references. </p>
        <p>My daughter Kristi went looking for information on
        Melungeons, a once-mysterious ethnic group (from which
        she and I are probably descended) living in areas of
        Appalachia when the French arrived in the 18th century.
        She filled several pages. </p>
        <p>Ditto for werewolves; while doing research for a
        mystery novel, I found scientific studies,
        quasi-scientific studies, folklore and people who
        believed themselves to be werewolves. </p>
        <p>Recently, I explored an area called news groups. The
        name is misleading. The news groups are places where
        people with similar interests can send and receive
        pictures and articles. There are groups devoted to every
        imaginable subject from science to God. </p>
        <p>As I scrolled through the news groups, I found a
        series dedicated to sexual fetishes. The fetishes were
        broken down into specialties such as: wife-swapping,
        amputees, fat, tickling, water sports, bestiality,
        pedophilia and some others I was not sophisticated enough
        to recognize. </p>
        <p>I already knew from years on the streets that human
        sexuality takes many forms. Still, it's one thing to know
        it and another thing to see devotees of different
        fetishes practicing their preference in living color or
        black-and-white. </p>
        <p>Many of the posted items are commercial ads, enticing
        people to order videos or CD-Rom disks. A lot, however,
        are personal photos that people share with like-minded
        individuals. It is now simple to make pictures with a
        camcorder or digital camera and convert them to something
        called text files that can be transmitted and decoded at
        the other end. </p>
        <p>What I found on the back roads of the information
        highway reminded me that it is essential to teach
        children what they need to know as they are growing up;
        in this day of fatal sexual encounters, anyone who can't
        talk about sex to their children had better hope that
        there are teachers who can and will. </p>
        <p>My teenage son surfs the Internet and drives on the
        roads of Tennessee. I am much more afraid of the
        automobile than of anything he might see or read. He has
        always been able to ask his parents about anything. My
        wife and I have been frank with our children about sexual
        matters; we have viewed honesty about such things as our
        duty. </p>
        <p>There are computer programs available to block out
        access to certain words or subject matter, but a curious
        and technologically savvy kid with a computer can get
        around any obstacle. </p>
        <p>When my children were small, I could watch them
        closely. My police weapons were kept out of their reach
        until they were tall enough to get to them. Then I sat
        them down and explained in graphic detail what a bullet
        does to the human body. None of them ever tampered with
        the tools of my trade. </p>
        <p>Like all powerful human inventions -- drugs,
        photography, printing, nuclear energy, gunpowder -- the
        Internet is a mixed blessing. It can be a tool of
        knowledge or a window into perversity. How it's used will
        pretty much depend on how a youngster has been raised. </p>
        <p>And anyone who thinks knowledge is more dangerous than
        ignorance had better think again. </p>

<TD WIDTH=470><H2>RESISTING CHANGE CAN BECOME AN ART IF DONE BY AN EXPERT</H2>

<I>By David Hunter, Columnist</I><P>

In 1984 my car tape player died, and I took it to a former officer who was in the business of repairing electronic equipment.  ``I can't fix that antique,'' he said. ``They don't even make parts for it anymore.''<P>

    I almost wept as he took out my beloved 8-track tape player and tossed it in a junk bin. He gave me an old FM/AM radio and cassette player and told me to use it until I could buy something better.<P>

    A couple of years later, I finally broke down and purchased the very last cassette player from the shelf of my local Radio Shack that wasn't incorporated in a car radio. I still have it.<P>

    My first published book was written on a Royal portable typewriter, a manual one. Cheryl talked me into buying a Brother word processor with my first small advance check. I thought it was the greatest thing since cotton candy; my next three books were written on it. I was certain there would never be anything better for writing.<P>

    Then one day a friend told me that I was being left behind by the world of technology. Reluctantly -- partly because of the cost, but mostly because I detest change -- I bought a computer. It allowed me to edit faster than I had ever imagined, and I actually learned to send in my column each week over a phone line.<P>

    It was two years later, however, when my friend, account executive Luann Scruggs, and her fellow employees over at U.S. Internet (USIT) coaxed me out into cyberspace. I still don't use on-line tools as much as I should, but they are available to me.<P>

    My resistance to change has not been limited to things electronic. I was the last person of my age to buy a pair of bell-bottom jeans and the last still wearing them when the world of fashion betrayed me again.<P>

    When the Knox County Sheriff's Department issued Glock pistols, I was in the hospital having my heart repaired. For almost another year I continued to carry my revolver, making one excuse after another why I hadn't switched over. Finally, I got the word to either go through Glock qualification or stay home.<P>

    Muttering under my breath that my revolver was equal to any street punk's semiautomatic weapon because of ``my superior training and skill,'' I showed up to go through what was called ``transition training.''<P>

    The truth was, I had never been more than adequate with a revolver.  Three days later, with shooting scores greatly improved, I was declaring the 9mm Glock to be the best weapon I had ever handled. I wasn't there to gripe when the department changed to .40-caliber Glocks.<P>

    It's my nature to resist change. Goodwill came and took away an armload of ties I had been hanging on to for years. They also got an old black and white photographic enlarger I hadn't used in five years and several pairs of shoes I had refused to throw away.<P>

    Now, my son has taken to calling my beloved computer an antique. He says I should upgrade to a better model. Maybe this time I will get with the program early on, rather than lagging behind.<P>

    Probably not, though; a man has to stand for something, even if it's only dragging his feet.<P>

ARE NOSTALGIC TREAURE </h2>
<p><em>By David Hunter, Columnist</em></p>
<p>I go around rescuing portable typewriters from thrift stores and pawn shops. 
It's been years since I actually used a typewriter for anything other than 
typing envelopes or labels, but I keep on carrying them home.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just nostalgia. When I was 16 my parents bought new furniture 
for my brother and me, including a desk. The following week, my father 
came home with a Royal portable typewriter, the manual kind.</p>
<p>That typewriter was special to me because it was the only acknowledgement 
I ever got from my father of my professed ambition to become a writer.</p>
<p>In Dad's worldview a peasant could become a bookkeeper or even an 
engineer, but the arts were something mysterious and beyond his 
understanding. </p>
<p>He would point to my short, stubby fingers (and his) as evidence of his 
theory. Artists of all kinds, he told me, had long delicate fingers.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I didn't believe him. He was a fine man, a man who pawned his 
treasured belongings at Christmas so that his children could have extravagant 
toys, but that was his blind spot.</p>
<p>He wanted me to study something ``practical.'' He had been hungry as a 
child and never forgot it; a practical means of earning a living was his second 
religion, not far behind his adopted Southern Baptist faith.</p>
<p>It took me only a couple of years to wear out that first typewriter. It was 
only the first of a dozen or so -- not counting the one I hurled out the back 
door one morning in 1975 while suffering a fit of depression. I vowed to 
waste no more time writing, but two weeks later, I picked up a new one at 
Kmart, and I haven't been without one since.</p>
<p>As the small manual typewriters become rarer, the price continues to drop, 
which is fortunate for me. I really don't have money to waste on things I 
don't need.</p>
<p>I usually spend a few hours cleaning up my new acquisitions, doing minor 
repairs, making them ready for duty. If civilization collapses, I'll be able to 
keep on writing, even without electricity.</p>
<p>My wife can't understand my fascination with old portable typewriters, any 
more than she understands my desire to prowl thrift stores and pawn shops. </p>
<p>To her, such places are a reminder of poverty and doing without; to me they 
are a reminder of Saturday afternoons spent with my father, looking for 
bargains.</p>
<p>On the rare occasions when I get out one of my machines to type a label or 
address an envelope, I remember why I love my computer so much. I was 
never a good typist; my manuscripts looked shabby even before an editor 
got hold of them -- always covered with liquid paper and messy erasures.</p>
<p>Still, I can't pass up an old portable typewriter. They seem to call out to me 
as I pass. </p>
<p>And I'm not alone with my obsession. I have a friend, an editor, who also 
collects old typewriters and finds excuses to use them. </p>
<p>I wonder if there's a club for people who collect old manual typewriters? Or 
maybe even a support group.</p>

<p><em>By David Hunter, Columnist</em></p>
<p>
Things are not always what they seem to be.<P>

   Last year I wrote about being involved in the production of a television pilot called ``America's Dumbest Criminals.'' <P>

   Since then, Rutledge Hill has published a book by the same name, written by Daniel Butler (the producer) and his crew.<P>

    The book spent several weeks on the national bestseller list, and the show has been syndicated and picked up by numerous stations across the country.<P>

    The folks at Rutledge Hill are proud of the book. Last Spring they had a celebration to which I was invited.  All guests received a black baseball cap bearing, in gold letters, the inscription ``ADC TASK FORCE.''<P>

    Not long ago, I went out to get gasoline, proudly wearing my souvenir hat. Maxie, my chief of security, a brilliant German shepherd, went with me.  She doesn't get out often, not unless there's someone else to watch the house.<P>

    At a BP station on Merchant Drive, I was filling my tank and Maxie was watching with interest, when a pickup with a tag from the Southwest pulled in beside us. While the driver filled his tank, the passenger, a big man in jeans, cowboy boots and a ball cap walked around behind my car.<P>

    Looking closely at my Fraternal Order of Police tag, my ball cap, then at Maxie, he asked: ``Is that a drug-sniffing dog?''<P>

    ``Explosives,'' I answered without hesitation.<P>

    He nodded his head, as if in deep thought for a moment, then said: ``I want to let you know that not everybody is against your agency.  There are a lot of people like me, who don't blame y'all for the thing at Waco. We appreciate the work you guys at ADC do. It's a dangerous job.''<P>

    I thanked him on behalf of my friends at the ADC and let him pet Maxie, who also thanked him in her own fashion. Everyone left happy. And hopefully, the guys at ATF will also be happy when they read this.<P>

   A few years ago, signing books in Birmingham, Ala., I suddenly found myself with a long line of teenagers in front of my table. Now, being aware that I had never drawn the same kind of crowds as John Grisham or Fabio, I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least.<P>

    Several of the youngsters lined up at the table had my book under their arms, but many were carrying advance flyers that had been handed out in preparation for my appearance. I signed those flyers with the same enthusiasm as the books. A fan, after all, is a fan.<P>

    My bubble burst a few minutes later when I was confronted with a redheaded youngster, who stared at me with a critical expression. ``Did you want an autograph?'' I asked.<P>

    ``Yeah, but I'm gonna have to tell ya, Rick, that you look a lot taller on your television show.''<P>

    That was when I realized that my crowd of ``fans'' thought I was former professional football player Fred Dryer, who had a successful second career with his police drama about a homicide detective named Sgt. Rick Hunter.<P>

    I told the young man that there were special cameras to make short people like me look a lot taller on television. I'm not sure he believed me, but he took the autograph and went on.<P>

    Nope. Things are not always what they seem to be; not by a long shot.<P>

UNPREDICTABLE WAYS </h2>
<p><em>By David Hunter, columnist</em></p>
<p>I have said it before, and now I'll say it again: I never know what kind of 
reaction to expect from a given commentary. Sometimes I labor hard on a 
treasured subject, expecting (and hoping) to touch off a fire storm, but 
nothing happens. At other times, the floodgates open when I'm least 
expecting it.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I did a piece on my propensity for bringing home stray 
portable typewriters of the manual kind. Letters are still coming from readers 
offering to sell or give me typewriters.</p>
<p>All who have offered to give me their vintage machines are former career 
women with fond memories of school and work. The majority are in their 
70s or 80s and simply want their treasures placed with someone who will 
appreciate the significance of a cherished tool.</p>
<p>I haven't had so much mail on a subject since the week I expressed the 
opinion that Rodney King brought all his troubles upon himself, including the 
richly deserved, televised butt-kicking he got.</p>
<p>A column on depression also brought a surprisingly large response. Every 
letter was in agreement that mental illness is still looked upon by most people 
as a character flaw, and that insurance companies and employers give short 
shrift to those seeking psychological treatment.</p>
<p>One woman confessed that she had, for years, accused her depressed 
daughter of laziness, telling her over and over again that smiling would cure 
depression -- right up to the day of a serious suicide attempt.</p>
<p>My contention that people suffering from depression and other treatable 
illnesses have to hide their conditions in order to earn a living, was borne out 
by the touching letters that came to my mailbox. Most were afraid to give 
their names, even to an ally.</p>
<p>My comments on a book of religious humor I am writing also brought lots of 
letters, both postal and e-mail. For the most part, my readers had a joke to 
share or wanted to know when the book would be out. (The answer is next 
year, probably.)</p>
<p>The author of one five-page rebuke, however, quoted scripture and 
objected strenuously. The letter was written on lined yellow paper (which 
seems to be the favorite writing paper of the philosophically challenged) in a 
shaky but determined ballpoint script; the writer accused me of sacrilege, 
blasphemy, and, as best I could tell, of mopery and dopery in the Bible Belt.</p>
<p>I wanted to write back and ask him just how many angels really can dance 
on the head of a pin, but -- as usual with epistles from jackleg theologians -- 
there was no signature or return address.</p>
<p>If the e-mailthat started coming in just hours after last Monday's paper came 
out is an indication of things to come, my column on the Libertarian Party 
has touched another nerve.</p>
<p>Many people from the Democrat and Republican Parties have contacted me 
to express the opinion that Harry Browne, the Libertarian presidential 
candidate, should be included in all debates, strictly as a matter of good old 
American fair-play.</p>
<p>Several Libertarian activists have also requested that I mention the fact that 
all their campaigns are run strictly with freely given donations; no tax funds 
are involved.</p>
<p>The same people have also asked me pass on an additional telephone 
number for those interested in learning more about ``the party of principle.'' 
Here's the toll free number: 1-800-682-1776. </p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>August 5, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>HOW ONE LOOKS AT THE WORLD 
SHIFTS MIGHTILY WITH AGE </h2>
<p><em>By David Hunter, Columnist</em></p>
<p>Winston Churchill, upon turning 55 -- or so the story goes -- was asked 
how it felt to be ``middle-aged.'' His reply was: ``Middle-aged? How many 
people do you know who are 110 years old?''</p>
<p>Though it sounds like something Churchill would have said, this may well be 
one of those anecdotes you can never substantiate. Such tales, however, 
become folk legends with a life of their own after being told often enough.</p>
<p>Legend or gospel truth, it always makes me pause to think of how I viewed 
age in my youth -- as opposed to how I see it now:</p>
<p>When I was about 12 years old, I sat down one evening and calculated how 
old I would be in the year 2000 -- assuming, of course, that a nuclear 
holocaust or cancer didn't get me first.</p>
<p>I remember coming to the conclusion that even if I did reach the ancient age 
of 53, life wouldn't be worth much to such a tottering, feeble old man.</p>
<p>As the human race quickly approaches a new millennium and I the 
half-century mark, I have come to realize that many people, maybe most, 
are just beginning to make sense of things after 50 years.</p>
<p>It has taken me this long just to learn how to write a coherent sentence -- 
most of the time.</p>
<p>At the age of 17, when I had my first real love affair, I would look at my 
parents (and her parents, too) with pity. It was obvious that people in their 
late 30s could not possibly grasp how we felt.</p>
<p>Though I didn't know at what age sexual passion actually ended, I was 
pretty sure it was gone by the age of 35.</p>
<p>These days, I understand the difference between gulping down my meals 
and slowly savoring them, the difference between quantity and quality. I also 
know that passion ages like good wine. So do good men and women.</p>
<p>When the Beatles made their first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show, I, 
along with millions of other people my age, sat entranced, throbbing with the 
beat, swaying back and forth, feeling as if the music had been written just for 
me.</p>
<p>My father came into the room, watched and listened to the Fab Four with 
their shaggy haircuts and mod suits, then shook his head slowly, obviously 
not understanding what was going on. Today, I can turn on MTV and know 
exactly how Dad felt that evening in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>At the age of 25, I was certain that I would be a tremendously successful 
novelist before I turned 40 -- success being defined as world fame and 
scads of money. Later than that, I thought, would make me too old to enjoy 
it.</p>
<p>The money and world fame haven't materialized. But it really doesn't matter 
that much. I'm fairly well-known in Knox County, I don't lack anything I 
really need, most body parts still work, and a lot of people read my books.</p>
<p>Since there's no place else I'd rather be than here with my family and friends, 
I consider myself not only successful, but extremely blessed.</p>
<p>Still, I understand why my children always make faces at displays of 
affection between their parents. I don't really mind. One day, much sooner 
than they expect, they'll look back and realize how ignorant they were.</p>

ACT OF RETIREMENT </h2>
<p><em>By David Hunter, Columnist</em></p>
<p>The day I left the Knox County Sheriff's Department for health reasons, I 
made myself a promise that I wouldn't become one of those retired officers 
who always stop at tables where working cops are trying to catch a hurried 
meal.</p>
<p>``I used to be with such and such agency,'' they will say, reaching out to 
shake hands. ``Just thought I'd stop and say hello.'' Most officers are 
courteous to former colleagues, but such moments are generally a little 
awkward and strained.</p>
<p>Cops don't like to be reminded that there will be a time when they are no 
longer on the job themselves. The older a cop gets, the less he or she wants 
to think about the day when there will be a retirement party, where friends 
and former partners gather to tell stories about the old days.</p>
<p>At my retirement party, I was presented with a Glock pistol as a going-away 
present from my friends and colleagues. It was an expensive gift, something I 
would never have bought for myself. And after all my years of training, after 
thousands of rounds fired at paper silhouettes, I managed to embarrass 
myself in front of my old comrades-in-arms.</p>
<p>When Sheriff Tim Hutchison presented me with the pistol, I stood holding it 
until my wife whispered that everyone was waiting for me to make sure the 
pistol was safe to handle. Clumsily, I worked the slide to make sure it wasn't 
loaded.</p>
<p>I hadn't forgotten what I had learned; I was focused so hard on maintaining 
my composure that everything else had taken second place. Cops don't like 
to cry in front of other people.</p>
<p>Everyone who wanted to speak was given an opportunity. My good friend 
Jim Watson talked about the days when he had ridden with me as a reserve 
officer. He told everyone I was prone to driving in hot pursuit while looking 
at the person to whom I was speaking instead of the road.</p>
<p>Fred Ludwig told the assembly of the days when I was a reserve officer, just 
talking about writing books. Gerald Whaley swore that Bill Wilson had cried 
when he found out I was leaving. The smiling, hefty detective, a specialist in 
irony, said Bill was upset because he would be the shortest person in the 
department when I was gone.</p>
<p>Bill, my captain for so many years, both as a patrol officer and detective, 
laughed, then made a short, gruff speech. Speaking is hard for him because 
he's a man of action. </p>
<p>I received my baptism by fire the night a deranged woman tried to kill him 
with a shotgun at point-blank range. When she was in custody, the family 
thanked us for our restraint under fire. When Capt. Wilson, still picking 
shotgun wadding from his injured eye, told the family that ``we were just 
doing our job,'' I swelled with pride.</p>
<p>It's taken me three years to write this final, goodbye column. When I hear a 
siren, my heart still beats faster. When I see a former colleague on the road, 
I wave. I miss being a cop the way I think I would miss an amputated limb. 
For me, law enforcement wasn't a job, it was a calling.</p>
<p>I've kept my word, though; I've never stopped at a table where a strange 
cop was trying to eat a hurried meal. But these days, I understand why some 
do it.</p>

On a long ago, hot July afternoon, standing outside a U.S. Army mess hall in South Carolina, I almost threw up my lunch when I realized that I had just eaten milk and fish. Without thinking, I had gulped the combination down because recruits were allowed only five minutes to eat.<P>

    My mother had always told me that milk and fish eaten together would cause serious illness, maybe death. But my fear of humiliation was apparently greater than my fear of dying; I got control of my stomach after a couple of bad moments. Neither I nor any of my 200 or so fellow recruits suffered any obvious discomfort.<P>

    Despite such strong evidence that fish and milk together are not poisonous, more than 30 years later I still avoid mixing the two items.<P>

    My mother's advice on the subject was evidently an ``old wives' tale,'' a type of folk legend defined by my dictionary as a ``superstition or silly story.''<P>

    My mother claimed -- as grounds for her warning -- that milk and fish together had almost killed her elder brother. However, in later life, I discovered this dietary taboo is widespread in parts of the South. It definitely qualifies as an old wives' tale, not a family tradition.<P>

    Recently, I ran across a little booklet called ``Old Wives' Tales,'' while standing in the checkout line at Kroger. It was written by Sue Castle and published by Globe Communications, the company responsible for the Globe tabloid.<P>

    I carried it home because I was amused by the idea that Globe Communications had published a book debunking dubious yarns -- a distinct change from stories about celebrity scandals, babies with bizarre birth defects and Elvis sightings.<P>

    So, if I trample on treasured old wives' tales, you can put the blame on Sue Castle and Globe Communications. Here are a few items passed on to me by my mother, but disputed by the author:<P>

    * If a dog's nose is hot and dry, he's sick. Nope. A dry nose reflects only that the dog has been inactive -- sleeping or just resting.<P>

    * Crossing your eyes will cause them to stick that way. Wrong. In fact, those who have the control to cross their eyes are least likely to develop crossed-eyes.<P>

    * Eating too much sugar can cause diabetes. Not so. Excessive sugar consumption can aggravate diabetes, but does not cause it.<P>

    * If you go swimming right after a meal, you'll get cramps. Wrong again. Cramps are more likely to be caused by fatigue, cold, exertion or just being out of shape.<P>

    * Put butter on a burn as soon as you can. In reality, butter holds in heat and makes things worse. The best first-aid for a minor burn is cool water.<P>

    * Never take a sick child outside. My mother practiced this one religiously, as did most of her generation -- until old family practitioners died off and housecalls ended forever.<P>

    * Shaving makes hair or whiskers grow back thicker. There isn't a bit of truth to this one -- though cutting off any kind of hair can make it look a little thicker.<P>

    Take this column for whatever it's worth to you. <P>

   These days I'm educated and free of superstition, but I still don't eat milk and fish together. It may be that I and my entire company just got lucky that afternoon so long ago.<P>

REMINDER OF CHILDHOOD GAMES </h2>
<p><em>By David Hunter, Columnist</em></p>
<p>When I was an elementary-school kid playing baseball on the 
soot-blackened dirt of Lonsdale, there was a boy with freckles and 
protruding ears whose name now escapes me. He was memorable only 
because he received a huge allowance every week.</p>
<p>As I recall, his father handed him the unbelievable sum of three dollars a 
week, a veritable fortune, to squander as he pleased.</p>
<p>He was, of course, the object of much preadolescent envy because he could 
always afford a new baseball, not to mention an unlimited supply of soft 
drinks, potato chips, candy and ice cream bars.</p>
<p>Possession of an expensive (by our standards) baseball at a place called the 
``end of the line,'' on Tennessee Avenue, just beyond Johnston Street, 
conferred instant status upon the owner.</p>
<p>``Hardballs,'' as we called them, were expensive and difficult to keep up 
with because we lost balls so frequently. Most often, they fell into a jungle of 
kudzu vines or were snatched by unscrupulous high school boys. But the end 
result was the same.</p>
<p>Without a baseball, we were forced to use a softball, which was ``sissy'' 
because it didn't hurt nearly as much when it hit you and thus held little 
likelihood of producing bragging rights by way of macho injuries.</p>
<p>Trying to play baseball without a real ball was like trying to shoot marbles 
without a genuine red chert stone shooter, also called a ``cherry taw'' by 
those in the know.</p>
<p>One simply did not violate the unwritten, but sacred laws of boyhood. So, 
when it came time for a baseball game, a boy with the only baseball was 
king -- or, more importantly, team captain and pitcher. It made no difference 
how little expertise the ball owner had. His word was law when he held the 
only regulation horsehide.</p>
<p>The point of this rambling story, for those of you who insist on every story 
having a moral, is that I have just this minute found out that Ross Perot was 
elected to be the presidential candidate for the Reform Party.</p>
<p>This news -- quite naturally, I think -- turned my thoughts to the kid with the 
protruding ears and huge allowance who always got to be captain and 
pitcher, even though, next to me, he was the worst player among us.</p>
<p>Theoretically, I suppose, Richard Lamm, a former Colorado governor, 
could have won the Reform Party nomination -- had the playing field been 
more level. As it was, Lamm claimed he was refused ready access to the 
Reform Party's mailing list.</p>
<p>It would be a good bet that everyone in the party, including paid officials 
who owe their livelihood to Perot, understood that if their nasal little Texas 
billionaire lost, he would take his ball and go home.</p>
<p>Too bad.</p>
<p>If the new party had elected any other candidate, it might well have been on 
its way to becoming a serious political entity, even though the Reform 
message is little different from what we are already hearing from the 
republicrats and demopublicans.</p>
<p>As things turned out, however, Ross of the Endless Homilies, the King of 
Cute, the Grand Pooh-bah of Harangue, has once more proven that the only 
thing he cares about is whether he gets to pitch.</p>
<p>Play ball, Ross! Try not to hit the umpire.</p>

LOCAL, NATIONAL BALLOTS </h2>
<p><em>By David Hunter, Columnist</em></p>
<p>While members of the news media are telling us more than we want to know 
about Bill Clinton and Bob Dole -- and occasionally hyping Ross Perot -- 
candidates from the third largest political party in America have been quietly 
campaigning, just as they have since 1971.</p>
<p>Those of you who watch C-SPAN or read more than the front page and 
comics already know Harry Browne is running for president as a Libertarian 
candidate. But did you know that Greg Samples of Lenoir City, a 
Libertarian, is opposing Fred Thompson for the U.S. Senate?</p>
<p>You probably didn't know because most political reporters in America are 
focused on the most highly visible power brokers. And while it's obvious not 
everyone who decides to run for president can be touted by the press, 
Browne, on the ballot in all 50 states, most certainly has earned the right to 
be treated seriously.</p>
<p>Not a personality cult founded around a George Wallace or a Ross Perot, 
not a one-issue tribe like the Green Party, Libertarian candidates have 
always run on clearly defined principles.</p>
<p>The central principle of Libertarianism is that the legitimate functions of 
government are few; most party members (but not all) grudgingly accept 
national defense, law enforcement and a court system as governmental 
functions. All other services, most party members believe, could best be 
provided by free enterprise.</p>
<p>Advocates of Libertarianism see themselves as the only real alternative 
party, firmly rooted in the U.S. Constitution, fervent champions of the Bill of 
Rights.</p>
<p>``The difference between Democrats and Republicans,'' said Preston 
Spaulding, who is running for the Fourth District seat, ``is that Democrats 
rob you with the left hand, and try to manage your remaining money, while 
Republicans use the right hand and try to manage your morals.''</p>
<p>In addition to the candidates mentioned above, I have also interviewed 
Libertarians Chris Dimit, Second Congressional District candidate; William 
Cole, running for the Third District seat; and Paul Schmidt, who is seeking 
the congressional seat for the First District. Dimit, Spaulding and Samples 
can all be called locally in the Knox County area.</p>
<p>Browne (unlike Mr. Perot) really doesn't want any campaign contributions 
from the U.S. government. All he wants is an equal opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p>Most Libertarians sincerely believe national exposure to the principles of 
their party will be all that is necessary to bring thinking people around to their 
way of looking at government.</p>
<p>While it has been said, in jest, that the way to run organized crime out of 
business would be to put the government in charge, Libertarians say the 
government is organized crime.</p>
<p>For every registered party member, there are numerous sympathizers who 
say they would vote Libertarian, but for fear of ``wasting'' a vote and 
perhaps helping to elect the ``wrong'' candidate. To this, Libertarians quickly 
point out moral principles, not immediate gratification, will change the world.</p>
<p>If you think Browne should be included in the debates, write a letter to: 
Commission on Presidential Debates, 601 13th St. NW, Suite 310-S, 
Washington, D.C., 20005.</p>

<HEAD><TITLE>INTERSECTION IS A TRAFFIC TRAGEDY WAITING TO HAPPEN</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><A HREF="/"><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="A Publication of News-Sentinel Online" BORDER=0></A><center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>September  9, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>INTERSECTION IS A TRAFFIC TRAGEDY WAITING TO HAPPEN</H2>

The intersection where northbound Interstate 75 exits at Emory Road has always been treacherous because of the blind hill on Emory and the heavy traffic from all directions, including that from Conner Road, which is offset from the interstate ramp.<P>

    The state planners responsible for the latest traffic-flow changes have taken what was a merely treacherous situation and made it critically dangerous. It's only a matter of time until tragedy strikes.<P>

    I know there are other danger spots in Knox County, so I freely admit bias in this matter because my family and I have no choice but to pass through the intersection several times a day.<P>

    Before the recent burst of construction, there was only a service station and sandwich shop sharing a building on the north side of Emory at Connor.  Emory Road was divided at the intersection and there was a clear turning lane. Crossing was risky, but at least there was a relatively safe place to do so.  A driver had only to watch for the westbound traffic coming over a blind hill and the few vehicles turning east.<P>

    As McDonald's and Wendy's went up on the north side of Emory, and Taco Bell, Buddy's Bar-B-Q, Dairy Queen and two service stations opened on the south side, I wondered how the state planned to safely handle traffic at the intersection.<P>

    Apparently they didn't plan at all. The ``solution'' was to fill and pave the divided section of Emory Road, paint some vague yellow lines and let everyone fend for themselves.<P>

    Think of it as a free-fire zone, only instead of bullets, those who use the intersection have to dodge speeding vehicles going in whichever direction drivers please, without so much as an arrow or a sign pointing the way.<P>

    I don't expect any law enforcement officer to write citations for traffic violations; there are no laws broken where the state leaves it to drivers to make up their own rules.<P>

    To safely get to Connor from the interstate or from eastbound Emory, drivers must now pull into a center lane marked only by yellow lines, and wait for a break in westbound traffic, while praying that no vehicle comes blindly west from any of the new businesses on Emory's south side.<P>

    Westbound tractor-trailers entering the center lane from a south-side business block the view entirely, confronting drivers in the crossing with Hobson's choice; either risk being crushed by the rig or pull blindly into westbound traffic in a form of vehicular Russian Roulette.<P>

    Direct access to Emory should never have been granted on a blind hill, but now that Pandora's Box has been opened, the only thing the state can do to create any semblance of order is to replace the divider in the center of Emory east of the interstate to halt the chaotic crisscrossing of heavy traffic, then create a safe crossing away from the blind hill.<P>

    A little inconvenience to the businesses involved just might prevent a major accident. If somebody would get right on it, it's possible we might soon have relief.<P>

    Don't bet on it, though. It's been a long while since the connection for a traffic signal at Emory and Brickyard was installed, and we're still waiting for the signal installation.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>AUTHOR'S NEW BOOK PREMIERES AT GUN SHOW IN THE SMOKIES</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><A HREF="/"><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="A Publication of News-Sentinel Online" BORDER=0></A><center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>September 16, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>AUTHOR'S NEW BOOK PREMIERES AT GUN SHOW IN THE SMOKIES</H2>

On Sept. 28 and 29, I'll be on display along with the Colt .45 pistols carried by Kevin Costner in ``Silverado,'' the 1985 Western that helped launch the careers of such Hollywood notables as Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover, Jeff Goldblum, Rosanna Arquette and Bryan Dennehy.<P>

    The Colt revolvers and I will both be at ``Mike Holloway's Gun Show in the Smokies.'' The pistols (acquired by Holloway in 1987 as an investment) will be for exhibit only, while I will be signing fresh-from-the-press copies of my latest book, a collection of police stories called ``The Archangel Caper.''<P>

    I can't prove it, but I think this will put me in a category by myself.  If there's another author around who could (or would) get away with introducing a book at a gun show, I don't know who it is. Probably someone will prove me wrong, but until that happens, I'll hold on to the distinction.<P>

    Later, I'll make traditional appearances, the kind that take place in bookstores. This will not, however, be the first unorthodox place where I have appeared to autograph books. I have also shown up at police roll calls and training seminars. It seems as logical to me as a cookbook author's appearance at a supermarket or restaurant.<P>

    My fans are not all cops, of course, but I have a lot of readers among the region's Thin Blue Line. A gun show is just another place where I can meet people who enjoy what I write. Many who show up will be accountants, executives, doctors, lawyers and even the occasional newspaper reporter.<P>

<P>

    Holloway took what was once a hobby and turned it into a thriving, successful business. Every two months, his ``Gun Show in the Smokies'' fills the Jacob Building at the Tennessee Valley A&I Fairgrounds with customers -- buying, browsing or just chatting with fellow hobbyists and friends.<P>

    Holloway's standards are strict regarding those who rent the 450 tables to sell their wares. Here are a few rules from his flyer: ``No T-shirts. No ball caps. No junk (this is not a flea market).'' <P>

   The building is patrolled 24 hours a day while the show is in progress, and anyone caught violating Mike's rules or the law is quickly shown the door.<P>

    There is a middle ground, a place of reason, far from the fringe areas occupied by rabid anti-gun partisans and equally unreasonable and inflexible pro-gun champions.<P>

    Mike Holloway stands in that place of reason, I think. He represents the right of law-abiding American citizens to own weapons for recreation and self-defense, but at the same time recognizes there is no such thing as an unlimited privilege in a civilized society.<P>

    A lot of people seem to agree with him, judging by the crowds that fill the Jacob Building on the weekends when ``Gun Show in the Smokies'' is there.  Mike Holloway does not put on the shows as a political statement, though. It's what he does for a living.<P>

    That's how things work under a system of free enterprise; ordinary people get a chance to win, lose or sit out the game -- whether or not everyone approves.<P>

<p><!--dateline--><br>
<font size=5>D</font>on Quixote, who jousted with windmills, has always been one of my 
heroes. Only those who don't know the danger of self-inflicted humiliation 
think of him as a clown. </p>
<p>The following story is a constant reminder of my own blunders. </p>
<p>I've told it before, so if you've already heard it, feel free to move on to other 
things. </p>
<p>Around 1986, I was dispatched on a domestic violence call in a Halls trailer 
park to a residence where I had been many times. I was in a hurry, armed 
with a brand-new domestic violence law. On every other trip before, the 
strutting, macho husband had ordered me and other officers away from his 
residence. </p>
<p>Prior to July of 1986, police officers in Tennessee had to witness a 
misdemeanor assault in order to make a warrantless arrest, a frustrating 
situation that allowed abusive husbands to beat and humiliate their wives with 
relative impunity. </p>
<p>Under the new law, officers were allowed to take action if it appeared 
violence had occurred or might occur. </p>
<p>When I arrived, the wife-beater was standing on his front porch in a football 
jersey, arms crossed and smirking. </p>
<p>When I got out of the cruiser, he yelled: ''Don't come in my yard. Everything 
is just fine here. That's what my wife will tell you.'' </p>
<p>Behind the man his wife stood, holding a bloody washcloth across the bridge 
of her nose. </p>
<p>It was a scene that had been played out too often. The man's smirk began to 
fade as I jogged towards him without slowing down. </p>
<p>Realizing that something was different, he jumped off the porch and ran 
around the trailer. </p>
<p>''You're under arrest for domestic violence!'' I yelled, mostly for the benefit 
of the numerous neighbors who had come out to watch the familiar scenario. </p>
<p>Moving under an adrenalin rush, I charged after the fleeing bully. That's 
probably why I didn't see the ankle-high, miniature picket fence that 
bordered the tiny yard. </p>
<p>As one toe hooked on it, I went airborne. It a was horrible feeling. </p>
<p>I came down in a perfect three-point landing in the wet grass -- on my chin 
and two elbows. </p>
<p>As my body came to a grinding halt, the momentum carried other things 
forward. My service pistol, radio, nightstick, back-up weapon and flashlight, 
all skidded on ahead. </p>
<p>As I sat up, grass and mud hanging from my chin, elbows ripped out of my 
sleeves, a reserve officer who had apparently arrived right behind me, came 
running up. </p>
<p>When he saw that I wasn't hurt, he began to struggle for control. In police 
circles, it's considered bad manners to laugh at a senior officer. </p>
<p>Realizing just how ridiculous I probably looked, I began to laugh. That set 
off the reserve officer; the next deputy on the scene also had a good laugh. </p>
<p>When it was over, they helped knock the mud and grass off my face and 
uniform and gathered my things as I explained the new law to the battered 
wife. </p>
<p>Later that night, the husband returned to resume his battering, and another 
officer put him in jail. </p>
<p>The moral of the story, I guess, is that sometimes you must either laugh with 
people or listen to them laugh at you. Don Quixote was braver than most. </p>

				<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he now infamous &#39;&#39;belch defense&#39;&#39; failed barrister Herbert S. Moncier in his attempt to gain a Sessions Court acquittal for client Hugh Ray Wilson in a much-ballyhooed trial for driving under the influence -- even though the breath-test result was not allowed in evidence.
<P>    In fact, the &#39;&#39;belch defense&#39;&#39; caused Wilson to be convicted the old-fashioned way, by an officer&#39;s observations. Before scientific tests, there was nothing else. If a creature had flat feet, waddled when it walked, had feathers, a flat beak and went &#39;&#39;quack, quack,&#39;&#39; it was presumed to be a duck -- or a drunken driver, as the case may have been.
<P>    Actually, breath-alcohol content was never meant to be more than corroborating evidence, since an officer must obviously have a suspect in custody to administer the test.
<P>    Certain actions give police officers reasonable grounds to stop a suspected DUI offender. Such suspicious activities include driving on the wrong side of the road, in the dark, without headlights, as Officer Gerald George testified to having seen Wilson do.
<P>    Heck, when you combine the aforementioned actions with slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, the odor of an alcoholic beverage and unsteadiness, even a rank civilian might jump to the conclusion that he was in the presence of a duck . . . or drunken driver.
<P>    Back to the &#39;&#39;belch defense,&#39;&#39; though. It was not invented by, but has obviously had fresh life burped into it by the cunning tactics of relentless courtroom warrior Moncier, who has appealed the conviction to Criminal Court.
<P>    Under Tennessee law, a suspected drunken driver must be observed for 20 minutes before being tested to make certain he (or she) has no alcohol left from the last drink, and no foreign object is placed in the mouth.
<P>    All alcohol is gone from the mouth within 12 to 14 minutes after the last drink, even with dentures in place. The extra waiting time is a margin of safety.
<P>    In Wilson&#39;s case, there was apparently no question that the time limit had been met. Instead, the canny Moncier presented the hypothesis his client had belched raw alcohol from his stomach during the waiting period, thus contaminating the breath sample.
<P>    And even though the special judge gave Wilson the benefit of a doubt by throwing out the test results, it was a totally unsubstantiated belch -- as they say in lawyer lingo.
<P>    To me, the &#39;&#39;belch defense&#39;&#39; smells a lot like the old &#39;&#39;I-know-I-was-speeding,-your-honor,-but-I-wasn&#39;t-going-that-fast&#39;&#39; defense. The drawback, it seems to me, is a suspect must convince the presiding judge that he drank an alcoholic beverage shortly before driving, which somehow seems a little at odds with good citizenship.
<P>    You have to wonder why cagey counselor Moncier didn&#39;t use his more familiar &#39;&#39;multiple personality defense.&#39;&#39; It would have been both elegant and less malodorous to have simply blamed everything on an evil alter ego called, say, Tommy Lee Billy Joe Jim Bob Wilson.
<P>    Of course,  when the case goes to a jury -- as it probably will -- the odds will shift dramatically in favor of Wilson. All he&#39;ll need is one juror who sympathizes with drunken drivers.
<P>    Hooray for justice.

<!--SUBHEAD--><p><font size=2><i>David Hunter News-Sentinel writer</i></font></p>
<p><!--dateline--><br>
<font size=5>I</font> n one of the Richard Llewellyn Welsh coal-mining novels of the series that 
began with ''How Green Was My Valley,'' a little girl is raped and murdered. 
The guilty man is caught, and a mob drags him to the nearest tree. Before the 
mob can act, however, the local pastor speaks to them. </p>
<p>As a youngster, I read the scene with a pounding heart. The pastor, at least 
to me, had been one of the most powerful characters -- wise, 
compassionate and godly. I waited for him to expound on the evil of human 
revenge. Instead, he told the mob to hang the guilty man and burn his body 
so as not to pollute the Earth. </p>
<p>Barely into my teens, I shared the outrage of the mob, but I didn't 
understand what seemed to be a totally out-of-character action by the kind, 
progressive Welsh pastor. Then I grew up, had daughters and became a 
police officer. </p>
<p>I think about that fictional scene every time I see Richard Allen Davis on 
television news or read about him. A career criminal, he dragged a 
12-year-old child named Polly Klaas from a bedroom slumber party on Oct. 
1, 1993 and murdered her. </p>
<p>When the creaking wheels of American justice finally convicted him of the 
crime, Davis showed what he thought of the world in general by saluting 
America with an obscene gesture and a sneer. </p>
<p>At his recent sentencing hearing, the child killer disturbed even his defense 
attorney and totally outraged the rest of the civilized world by accusing little 
Polly's father of sexually abusing her -- managing to turn the knife one more 
time in the souls of the anguished family members. </p>
<p>The appropriateness of the pastor's decision in Llewellyn's novel now stands 
revealed to me in total clarity. He was wise, kind and followed the Prince of 
Peace; but he understood that there are some crimes so vile, depraved and 
heinous that anything less than death for the offender trivializes the suffering 
of all the victims involved, and leaves poison in the very bloodstream of 
civilized society. </p>
<p>I don't know if the death penalty will deter other monsters like Richard Allen 
Davis. But I do believe that under the social contract accepted by civilized 
human beings, individuals give up the right to take matters in their own 
hands. In return, the state promises to act on their behalf. </p>
<p>Capital punishment is and always has been a social mechanism for revenge, 
a means of purging the body of society, just like the lancing of a boil cleanses 
flesh. </p>
<p>It isn't a pretty thought, but it's an honest one. I think it is necessary for the 
mental health and well-being of humanity at large. The lack of such may be 
one reason for the moral sickness that has pervaded our global community. </p>
<p>When (or if) the state of California gets around to executing Davis, it will be 
done in as quick and humane a way as possible. It will certainly be a more 
humane death than that which he administered to Polly Klaas in his dark, 
secret, ritual of evil. </p>
<p>I agree with what author Richard Llewellyn said through his dedicated 
Christian pastor. Take Davis out and execute him; his continued existence 
can only sicken the rest of us. </p>

        our bedroom door closed, locking Maxie in during her
        rounds. </p>
        <p>The latch wouldn't quite lock, but the space would be
        too narrow for our chief of security to push it open with
        her long German shepherd snout. So I looped an old
        necktie around the doorknob and showed her how to pull it open. </p>
        <p>She tried to avoid the lesson, of course. Maxie always
        resists learning a new trick, on principle, I suppose.
        Usually she goes into a demonstration of the last trick
        she learned to avoid the new one. </p>
        <p>To dodge the necktie lesson, she ran and got Cheryl's
        sandals. There was a time when Cheryl enjoyed sleeping in
        on Saturdays, but that was before I taught Maxie the
        sandal trick. It seemed like a good idea at the time. </p>
        <p>Now, if we lock the door, she lays outside in the
        hall, muttering under her breath and moaning until one of
        us lets her in. Then she grabs the sandals, one at a
        time, throws them on the bed with a toss of her head, and
        stands expectantly, waiting for Cheryl to go outside and
        play ''throw the tennis ball.'' </p>
        <p>After her initial resistance, Maxie reluctantly
        learned how to pull the door open with the necktie. She
        slammed it on herself a couple of times, forgetting to
        let go as she ran out, but soon had it down. Now she
        enters and exits as she pleases. </p>
        <p>In addition to her tricks, our furry, constantly
        shedding family member has also become an expert on what
        we wear. She knows the difference between work clothes
        and play clothes. </p>
        <p>On Monday, when everyone begins to don work and school
        attire, Maxie slinks into the living room, head down,
        tail dragging and crashes to the floor with an
        exaggerated sigh, obviously in the throes of a deep
        depression. </p>
        <p>But Maxie's main concern is security, and she takes it
        seriously. She knows our schedules and our places in the
        grand scheme of things. The first time my son took the
        car out alone, brand-new license in his pocket, Maxie charged
        up the stairs to get me, then paced the floors until he
        came back. </p>
        <p>It's amazing how quickly a dog can find its place in
        the family. I had never owned a German shepherd and had
        no interest in doing so. When we had a problem with a
        stolen purse and keys, we decided on a guard dog rather than
        an alarm system. Looking back, the electronic alarm
        system would have shed a lot less hair but never would
        have become a friend. </p>
        <p>German shepherd owners can identify each other by the
        dog hair clinging to our feet and clothing. There's no
        way around it. The breed sheds all year, nonstop, around
        the clock. </p>
        <p>As for Maxie, when I begin her lessons in preparing my
        morning coffee, she'll probably go back to the necktie
        trick in an attempt to divert me. </p>
        <p>They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks. But
        our canine family member is still going strong at 7. I
        guess nobody told her she's too old to learn. </p>
        <p>And if you should meet her, don't mention the age
        thing. I don't want to give her a real excuse to avoid
        new tricks. </p>

        mean really tall. Of course, you already knew that if
        you've been awake the last quarter century. But there's a difference
        between knowing a thing and comprehending it. </p>
        <p>On the court, among fellow basketball players,
        Abdul-Jabbar looked average. When you see him walk into a
        room, though, dwarfing the furniture and people, you
        begin to understand just how tall 7 feet is, and what it
        must feel like to live in a Lilliputian world. </p>
        <p>I recently watched the legendary athlete enter a hotel
        restaurant in Nashville. I resisted the urge to go over
        and speak to him because I know it can be difficult to
        eat with fans around. </p>
        <p>Not everyone was thoughtful. When Abdul-Jabbar was
        recognized by a startled fellow diner, the man jumped to
        his feet and spent 10 minutes talking about basketball as
        the cornered celebrity smiled and nodded patiently. </p>
        <p>Abdul-Jabbar was in Nashville for the eighth annual
        Southern Festival of Books to promote ''Black Profiles In
        Courage'' from William Morrow &amp; Co. I didn't see the
        basketball legend again -- and I missed actor-turned-poet
        Jack Palance altogether -- but there were other celebrities
        on hand. </p>
        <p>As I sat signing books on the porch of the War
        Memorial Building, I looked up and saw Dixie Carter of
        ''Designing Women'' fame walk by, followed by an
        entourage of attendants. She looked every bit as elegant
        and aristocratic as her former television persona, Julia
        Sugarbaker. </p>
        <p>She took a seat near me at the line of tables where
        several writers were signing autographs and a line
        immediately formed across the porch, with excited fans
        clutching at least one copy of ''Trying to Get to Heaven, Opinions
        of a Tennessee Talker'' from Simon &amp; Schuster. </p>
        <p>I chatted with friends, killing time until most of the
        crowd had gone away, then rushed to get a copy of the
        book before Ms. Carter was finished. Sheepishly, I snuck
        to the end of the line. </p>
        <p>When Dixie signed my book, I told her that William
        Kennedy -- back in 1990 -- was the last author I had
        waited in line for. She graciously informed me, in her
        husky and refined voice, that she was flattered to be
        called an author. </p>
        <p>Every single one of us is somebody's fan. Even
        presidents and kings get excited when they meet people
        they admire. </p>
        <p>The icing on my weekend cake came when the lovely
        Greta Garner-Hewitt, the daughter of James Garner, of
        ''Rockford Files'' fame, came by and picked up a couple
        of my recipes for a cookbook she is doing with Ken Beck
        and Jim Clark for Rutledge Hill Press. </p>
        <p>The work in progress, to be called ''The
        Cops/Detectives Cookbook,'' will consist of favorite
        dishes from real cops, writers of cop books, and actors, directors
        and producers who have worked in cop shows and movies. </p>
        <p>I am just a little awed by the idea of appearing in
        the same publication with the likes of Joseph Wambaugh,
        James Woods, Kirk Douglas, Karl Malden and Angela
        Lansbury. </p>
        <p>If it seems as if I've been dropping names today, it's
        because I have. I think we all like to get close to the
        magic sometimes. And it's not too hard, you know, to
        impress a kid from Lonsdale. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">T</font>hings I've had on my mind: </p>
        <p>* ''In matters of importance,'' Oscar Wilde wrote,
        ''style, not sincerity, is the vital thing.'' It sounds
        to me as if things haven't changed at all since Wilde made
        his comment in the last century. </p>
        <p>It appears likely that Bill Clinton, who reinvents his
        principles almost daily, will be re-elected president.
        Bob Dole and his advisers were foolhardy to have ever
        accepted a town-meeting format in the last debate.
        Clinton worked the crowd like a traveling medicine show
        barker, while Dole came across with all the warmth and
        sincerity of a marble statue. </p>
        <p>My observation concerning Clinton's lack of
        consistency is not to be interpreted as a suggestion that
        Bob Dole has clung steadfastly to his principles. The
        Republican candidate has changed positions more often
        than a circus contortionist, but nobody can beat Clinton
        in a game of musical ethics. They have convinced me that
        neither is fit to govern. So whatever happens, don't
        blame me. I'm going to vote for Harry Browne. </p>
        <p>* My nomination for the ''Most Tasteless Deed of
        1996'' goes to promoter Jeffrey Immediato of Anaheim,
        Calif., for his ''House of Terrors'' that featured a
        segment depicting the slaying of Nicole Brown Simpson, complete
        with a blond actress sprawled bleeding on a sidewalk.
        Immediato told reporters he would remove the display
        after an alleged complaint from Nicole's sister. The
        publicity generated by the display has reportedly brought
        in ''thousands of additional customers.'' Of course. </p>
        <p>* The Food and Drug Administration -- in another
        thinly disguised government attempt to impede the free
        flow of information among citizens minding their own
        business -- has stated its intent to regulate medical
        advice and drug promotions on the Internet. </p>
        <p>There wouldn't be an Internet if the government had
        been involved. A committee somewhere in Washington would
        still be doing feasibility studies. Cyberspace is the
        doorway to an information revolution that's changing the world
        more rapidly than the use of fire or the harnessing of
        atomic energy. It's happening because individuals have
        created it for their own rational self-interest -- which
        scares arrogant, patronizing professional politicians who
        think they know what's best. </p>
        <p>Supposedly, FDA officials are concerned that people
        might hurt themselves by following unsanctioned advice.
        But liberty carries risks. </p>
        <p>Our nosy big brother is trying to mimic Red China,
        which has already unlawfully seized control of Internet
        traffic to ''protect'' its citizens. Control of knowledge
        is power, and all governments crave power. </p>
        <p>* On a local note, the long awaited traffic signal at
        Emory and Brickyard roads still has not appeared. It
        seems that county officials and railroad executives are
        both trying to dodge responsibility in case a car gets
        stuck on the tracks and is hit by a train. While the
        railroad and county officials protect themselves,
        taxpayers are involved in a daily game of Russian roulette
        at that intersection and others in the community. </p>
        <p>And these are the kind of people who would be put in
        charge if the government controlled the Internet. It's a
        scary thought. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">A</font>s we drove south on the two-lane
        Alcoa Highway one cold winter day in 1959, I watched my
        father out of the corner of my eye. I had an important
        question, and I wanted the most favorable conditions. </p>
        <p>Just after a lunch that had been preceded by Sunday
        morning worship service was generally a good time to ask
        things of my father. Fortified with the gospel and a good
        meal, he was most likely to say yes. </p>
        <p>I glanced covertly at his ruddy complexion, his hair
        gone almost white at 33 and the Hunter nose I had
        inherited. Once when I had referred to the hereditary
        Hunter beak as a ''Roman nose,'' my father had responded, ''Yeah,
        they roam all over our faces.'' </p>
        <p>Finally, I screwed my courage to the sticking post,
        took a deep breath and blurted it out: ''When will I be
        old enough to go to town by myself? Roy Warwick already
        gets to ride the bus to town by himself!'' </p>
        <p>The bus to which I referred passed Rifle Range Road
        twice a day, once going and once coming. In my mind, that
        blue bus had become the road to freedom and adult
        responsibility. </p>
        <p>When my father did not immediately say no, my heart
        began to thump as he down-shifted the pink and gray V-8
        1956 Studebaker Ambassador. </p>
        <p>''Well,'' Dad said, staring straight ahead without
        even a hint of a smile, ''I think you ought to be able to
        go to town by yourself when you turn 21. Even if your
        mother doesn't like it.'' </p>
        <p>My heart sank. My father -- the master of dry, deadpan
        humor -- had suckered me once again. He wasn't even going
        to give serious consideration to my request. Or was he?
        On rare occasions, a positive answer would be preceded by
        a little humor. </p>
        <p>''No, really,'' I said. ''I'm the only kid in my class
        who doesn't go to town alone.'' </p>
        <p>''I doubt that,'' Dad replied, turning into the
        parking lot of University Hospital. Silence prevailed as
        he found a parking space. We were there to visit one of
        his friends. I decided not to push the matter any
        further. </p>
        <p>We walked, shivering, across the parking lot. Just
        inside the doors, my father paused and handed me the car
        keys. ''I left a book on the front seat. Go get it, will
        you?'' </p>
        <p>Keys in hand, I dashed out to the parking lot, still
        thinking about unchaperoned trips to town with my
        friends; trips that would include movies and ice cream
        sodas at Walgreens. </p>
        <p>It took less than a minute for me to realize that I
        didn't remember where we had parked. There seemed to be
        hundreds of vehicles scattered over an acre of asphalt. </p>
        <p>I was soon out of breath and ready to give up when I
        finally spotted the Studebaker -- and my father standing
        beside it, hands in pockets. </p>
        <p>I walked to him, eyes downcast, and handed him the
        keys. There was an amused look in his eyes, but he didn't
        say anything. I knew the verdict, though. How could a boy
        who couldn't find a car in a parking lot be trusted to
        find his way home? </p>
        <p>That's why it was such a surprise when Dad handed me
        bus fare and spending money a couple of days later so I
        could spend a school holiday in town with my friends. </p>
        <p>It was that day when it dawned on me that my father
        probably remembered what it was like to be a boy. But I
        had children of my own before I knew just how hard it
        must have been to turn me loose and let me fly. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">A</font> little over a year ago, my wife
        and I were on our way out for a late dinner. Not far from
        the house, we came upon a vehicle overturned in a curve.
        It had gouged a long slice from the embankment and was
        just settling on its side. I realized that if we had left
        home just seconds earlier, we might well have been
        involved in a head-on collision. </p>
        <p>Several people stopped and pulled the driver out. I
        knew before I got to him that he was drunk. I've seen too
        many accidents and too many drunk drivers not to
        recognize the tell-tale signs -- obviously excessive
        speed, no plausible reason for having struck a fixed
        position, and the odor of alcoholic breath mixed with
        antifreeze and steam. </p>
        <p>The most certain sign, though, was his determination
        to leave the scene before an officer could arrive. </p>
        <p>I suggested that he wait; when he decided to disregard
        me, I grabbed him by the collar, propelled him to the
        side of the road and sat him down with a warning not to
        get up. I had gone into my command voice without conscious
        thought. </p>
        <p>While one of the spectators made a sarcastic remark
        about my lack of pity for a fellow human being, I stepped
        into the shadows and put a nitroglycerine tablet under my
        tongue. </p>
        <p>I wasn't hurting; I have a silent variation of
        coronary disease, but I have learned to pay attention to
        any slight burn in my chest that feels like indigestion. </p>
        <p>I'm never quite sure if something I ate has disagreed
        with me or -- as Fred Sanford used to say -- if it's
        ''the big one.'' </p>
        <p>When Ashley Coulter, the enthusiastic, young officer
        who runs my old beat arrived, he concurred with my
        evaluation. The belligerent driver went to jail. His
        blood-alcohol level turned out to be nearly double the
        arbitrary and excessive level allowed by the state of
        Tennessee. </p>
        <p>After we left the scene, Cheryl said: ''You still miss
        it, don't you?'' </p>
        <p>I didn't really have to answer. After three years, I
        still patrol the streets in my dreams. The first year was
        so bad, I was lucky Cheryl stayed with me. I was like an
        injured dog, howling at the moon and biting my wounds in
        rage. </p>
        <p>Accepting the term ''disabled'' is difficult for
        anyone. For a man who had gloried in adrenalin rushes and
        toe-to-toe confrontations it was agony to be unable to do
        any type of physical labor or even work under emotional stress. </p>
        <p>My friend and attorney, Dick Krieg summed up my
        situation. ''Nobody's going to give you a job that they
        think will kill you.'' I knew he was right, but it was a
        bitter pill. Besides, there aren't a lot of calls for
        crippled warriors these days, no matter how eloquent. </p>
        <p>True, there were unwritten books to fill up the void,
        but books are mostly an expensive hobby for writers. I
        reluctantly learned to live on a pension and Cheryl's
        salary and to hope that I might actually earn a living
        again one day. </p>
        <p>Since I've never looked<b> </b>sick, there have been
        those who have snidely hinted that I've taken the system
        for a ride, that I am drawing a pension I don't deserve.
        And that hurts. </p>
        <p>But I don't dwell on such things. I thank God for what
        I do have -- a loving family and friends and a gift for
        telling stories. </p>
        <p>Besides, I'm an optimist at bottom. I've been down in
        the mud and the blood and slime often enough to know that
        it ain't over until it's over. </p>
        <p>Not by a long shot.<b> </b></p>

        into a strange restroom almost anywhere and find either
        paper towels or the cloth kind that came out of a metal
        container in measured lengths. You could actually dry
        your hands with them. </p>
        <p>Today you're more apt to find high-pitched blowers
        that throw out a little heat and a lot of air. You can
        only dry your hands if you have 20minutes to kill. Hands
        dry without help in 20minutes. </p>

        alt="***"> Once there were real newspapers that
        reported genuine news, as opposed to gossip magazines
        that ran stories about the sex lives of famous people.
        Today, there's not a lot of difference between the
        tabloids and supposedly serious publications. </p>

        alt="***"> Once upon a time, John Wayne, who
        never heard a shot fired in anger, was held up as a great
        hero because he swaggered, talked tough and made war
        movies. Today, we don't even have that much. </p>
        <p>Our children, looking for heroes, turn to the likes of
        Michael Jackson and Madonna. </p>

        src="../../..images/blkbul.gif"
        alt="***"> There was a time when the only music
        you could get in a car was from the radio. Then came the
        8-track tapes, which were replaced by little cassettes,
        which are now being done in by compact disks. Is nothing sacred? </p>

        alt="***"> Reading for fun, at least in the
        United States, is becoming rare among youngsters with
        computers. If reading dies out, will literature
        disappear? Or will the next generation of American
        writers come from families too poor to own computers? </p>

        alt="***"> When my peers and I were young, the
        surly and rebellious among us didn't make a social
        statement by getting tattooed; we smoked cigarettes. If the
        artists practice good hygiene, tattoos are a lot safer, I
        think. </p>
        <p><img

        alt="***"> Before television became affordable,
        I listened to radio dramas like ''Inner Sanctum'' and
        ''The Lux Mystery Theater.'' The monsters I conjured in
        my imagination -- while hiding breathless under the
        covers -- were more frightening than anything I have
        since seen on television. </p>
        <p>In 1957, a young crooner with an ingratiating grin and
        white shoes, by the name of Pat Boone, had a hit song
        called ''Love Letters in the Sand.'' Because he refused
        to kiss any woman other than his wife, even in a movie scene,
        the apparently squeaky-clean Boone was heralded, in some quarters,
        as a healthy alternative to other less savory singers. </p>
        <p>But I never did like him; today I don't like anyone
        who reminds me of him. I was happy when he disappeared
        into the sunset with other novelty acts. </p>

        <font size="5">S</font>ame song, different singers: </p>
        <p>While I was at Fort Jackson in 1965, a drill
        instructor entered the barracks across from mine one
        night and tried to sodomize an 18-year-old recruit. Another
        soldier turned on the lights and literally caught the
        sergeant with his pants down. </p>
        <p>He left hurriedly, but showed up for work the next
        morning as if nothing had happened. When he attempted to
        bring the training company to attention, we refused to
        obey. All of us understood the possible consequences of mutiny
        but stood firm until the first sergeant showed up and
        repeated the order. </p>
        <p>By that afternoon, the offending drill instructor had
        vacated his room. That night, after lights out, the
        entire company was ordered to fall out in front of the
        four barracks we shared. </p>
        <p>We stood at attention, all 200 of us, shivering in our
        underwear, while being questioned as a group about
        allegations against a drill instructor. We all got the
        unspoken message. Keep quiet. </p>
        <p>There was never an official investigation, nothing
        went on paper. The officers in charge knew about the
        early morning mutiny, but they didn't ask any questions
        or pass along what they knew to their superiors. </p>
        <p>The night we shipped out, the drill instructor who had
        attempted to sexually assault a recruit was moving back
        into his old room. </p>
        <p>Several years ago, a group of female Marines and Navy
        personnel calling themselves ''The Family'' were put on
        trial for breaking nonfraternization regulations. A
        multitude of officers and noncoms were convicted of engaging
        in sexual activities with recruits. </p>
        <p>There was hardly a ripple in the news. In fact,
        several years later, when Sam Donaldson interviewed
        retired Marine Colonel Dave Beck, now a Knoxville lawyer,
        on national television about Beck's prosecution of the renegade
        officers and noncoms, the entire episode was made to look
        like a homophobic witch hunt -- not a violation of
        nonfraternization orders. </p>
        <p>Now there is a scandal involving male noncoms and
        officers and female Army recruits. Many who shrugged off
        the lesbian sexual activities of Marine and Navy
        personnel as consensual sex are outraged by the latest stories
        of abuse -- as we all should be. </p>
        <p>There are two lessons here: Double standards
        eventually fail, and there can never be truly consensual
        sexual activity between recruits, whatever their gender,
        and those in authority over them, any more than there can
        be consensual sex between adults and children. That is
        why there are such strict rules against fraternization
        between recruits and trainers. </p>
        <p>Obviously, though, nonfraternization rules have
        frequently been ignored with impunity. Frightened,
        isolated recruits still keep quiet because they learn early
        on of the professional military habit of protecting the
        organization at all costs. </p>
        <p>Most military training personnel, I have no doubt, are
        brave, ethical people who live by the rules. But sexual
        abusers of all kinds seek out positions where they can
        wield power over victims. They become scout leaders, counselors,
        clergymen, drill instructors and even cops. </p>
        <p>I'm satisfied that mistreatment of recruits is mostly
        a sin of omission. Otherwise good people have pretended
        not to see such things because of a misguided code of
        silence. </p>
        <p>Institutionalized abuse can be eliminated by rooting
        out the abusers. Before it can be done, though, the
        military will have to provide real advocates, outside the
        chain of command, with power to protect recruits and investigate
        allegations of misbehavior. Professional chaplains can't
        do it because they are vested in the system. </p>
        <p>We should be able to send our sons and daughters off
        to serve their country with the assurance that they will
        not be abused. </p>

        <font size="7">E</font>ntertainer Con Hunley was recently
        convicted in a Sevier County courtroom of driving under
        the influence. </p>
        <p>Hats off to Officer Rene Kendall of the Pigeon Forge
        Police Department for making an arrest that was sure to
        be controversial and time-consuming and to Judge Charles
        Sexton for applying the law as it was written -- without
        regard for Hunley's star status. </p>
        <p>I have nothing against Con Hunley; I don't know him
        personally. But he would not be allowed to fire a weapon
        down a crowded Sevier County street, and he should not be
        allowed to drive a piston-powered guided missile into
        oncoming traffic while impaired. </p>
        <p>Hunley's attorney, Steve Oberman, is one of the best.
        By his standards, he had every reason to expect an
        acquittal or reduction to reckless driving for his famous
        client. </p>
        <p>Oberman literally wrote the book on the defense of DUI
        violators. Many of his colleagues across the country
        consult that book. Partly because of Steve's expertise,
        the state's presumed intoxication level of 0.10, and anything
        in the vicinity has come to be called borderline in most
        local courtrooms. </p>
        <p>Because of an overload of DUI cases, local judges --
        for the most part -- have come to accept that a 0.10
        blood alcohol level really is minor. Officers, who know
        better, have learned to live with reductions at levels as high
        as 0.15. </p>
        <p>The problem with the state standard is that everyone,
        regardless of size or drinking experience, is impaired
        and unfit to drive at less than half the presumed level
        of 0.10. That's right. Ask any expert in the field of physiology
        or a beat cop who scrapes victims off the highways. </p>
        <p>At night, with a blood alcohol level of 0.10, a driver
        traveling 55 mph will hit anything stopped in the road
        before he can get his foot to the brake; the distance
        covered by bright beams exceeds reaction time. </p>
        <p>Alcohol penetrates the three layers of the brain from
        the outside in. By the time stumbling, slurred speech and
        other characteristics of impairment can be seen, the
        outer layer of the brain has long since been
        anesthetized. </p>
        <p>It's that outer part of the brain that keeps people
        from urinating in public, wearing lamp shades on their
        heads -- or getting behind the wheel of a car while
        impaired. Anyone who drinks enough to anesthetize the
        third and inner layer of the brain goes to sleep
        permanently. </p>
        <p>There have been rumblings in the Legislature about
        reducing the level of presumption to 0.08. It still
        wouldn't be nearly enough to make a lot of difference.
        And don't hold your breath; the liquor lobbyists still
        wield more power over the Legislature than the governor. </p>
        <p>Remember the Golden Rule? In Tennessee, it means that
        those with the gold make the rules; liquor lobbyists have
        lots of gold. Never mind that impaired drivers cost more
        in damages, human suffering and criminal process than all
        the felonies committed in America every year. </p>
        <p>There's a lot of talk about zero tolerance these days,
        especially in our school systems. Why not zero tolerance
        in DUI cases? Nobody has the right to endanger innocent
        people or to make a profit by selling recreational drunkenness
        to drivers. The line is too thin, the tolerances too
        small, to let people who have already impaired their
        judgment decide whether they're fit to drive. </p>
        <p>If judges enforce the letter of the law, attorneys
        like Steve Oberman will develop new strategies to defend
        their clients; it's their job. It would certainly be
        nice, though, if all judges followed the lead of Sevier
        County's Judge Charles Sexton. </p>
        <p>Give the cops a level playing field, and they'll score
        a lot more often. Your life may depend on it. </p>

        <font size="5">T</font>hings you probably didn't know: </p>
        <p>Were you aware that ''Louie Louie,'' the song that
        struck terror into the hearts of a generation of parents
        during the 1960s has been recorded nearly a thousand
        times and sold an estimated quarter-billion copies since
        a band called the Kingsmen first recorded it in 1963? </p>
        <p>Did you know that the original version by Richard
        Berry had not a single naughty word? Or that there have
        been several albums with nothing but different versions
        of the song? </p>
        <p>I didn't know it until I picked up a book called
        ''Jane &amp; Michael Stern's Encyclopedia of Culture''
        published by HarperCollins. Here are a few things that
        caught my fancy. </p>
        <p>* Howdy Doody, the freckle-faced marionette, is
        considered to have been the first nationally known
        television celebrity -- preceding Milton Berle, Gorgeous
        George and Ricky and Lucy. </p>
        <p>Howdy's first appearance -- under the name of Elmer, a
        dim-witted country boy -- was on a 1945 radio show called
        ''TripleBRanch.'' He was picked up by NBC for a show
        called ''Puppet Playhouse,'' where he was first called by
        the name that would become a household word. </p>
        <p>Until 1955, when the ''Mickey Mouse Club'' went on the
        air, Howdy Doody had no real competition. But faced with
        the cute Mousketeers like Annette Funicello and Cubby
        O'Brien, the puppet and his pal, Buffalo Bob, began to
        slip in the ratings. The series ended in 1960. </p>
        <p>* June 6, 1933, Richard Hollingshead Jr. combined two
        of America's loves in Camden N.J. -- movies and
        automobiles. He erected a 40-foot screen on a lot with
        parking and speakers for 400 cars, and the drive-in movie
        was born. By 1955, there were 4,000 of them across
        America. </p>
        <p>My generation grew up with them. Not only were the
        drive-in theaters a boon to the movie industry, they were
        also educational. At a time when a brief class in health
        was the only reference ever made to sex by parents or
        teachers, a lot of baby-boomers learned the facts of life
        under the lights of the big screens. </p>
        <p>In the '70s, drive-in movies were killed off by the
        high price of gasoline and the rising price of property.
        I miss them. </p>
        <p>* Though underarm deodorants had been around a while,
        it was a product called Odo-Ro-No that finally got frank
        about body odor in 1919 when it told its customers to
        take the ''Armhole Odor Test'' by sniffing their blouses.
        </p>
        <p>Old standbys like Mum antiperspirant had been around
        since 1888, but they had concentrated on daintiness and
        sweetness, avoiding actually talking about the socially
        unacceptable problem of stinky armpits. </p>
        <p>In the early days, only women wore deodorant. Then, as
        more and more people joined the middle class in the '40s,
        the products really took off for both sexes. From small
        beginnings, the smell-good philosophy grew to include
        breath, feminine hygiene and even deodorants for houses
        and cars. </p>
        <p>* Credit cards as we know them were born in 1950 when
        a New York loan company operator named Frank McNamara
        found himself short of cash at a restaurant. Because of
        the embarrassment, McNamara convinced 28 New York
        restaurant managers to not only accept cards in lieu of
        cash from members of a newly-organized Diners Club but to
        also pay him a fee. </p>
        <p>American Express jumped in with a credit card in 1958,
        followed by the Bank-Americard (now called Visa) in 1965
        and Master Charge in 1967. Today, most of us have several
        credit cards. Never mind that we spend 23percent more
        when we use plastic as opposed to cash. </p>
        <p>It's the American way! </p>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->        <font size="5">C</font>hristmas is upon us again. It's
        time to pause and give thanks, not only for what we are
        about to receive but also for that which we have already
        been given: </p>
        <p>* My wife and I got an early Christmas present this
        year. On Dec. 14, our daughter, Elaine, graduated from
        the University of Tennessee with a degree in marketing. </p>
        <p>Elaine is not my biological daughter, but over the
        last 20 years I have been on hand to watch her grow from
        a solemn 2-year-old to a beautiful, poised young woman. </p>
        <p>Just about the time Cheryl and I were ready to start
        selling body parts to send her to college, she won an
        all-expense-paid scholarship and a job as an intern with
        the Tennessee Valley Authority. Congratulations to Elaine
        and Merry Christmas to Cheryl and me. </p>
        <p>* I didn't die again this year. </p>
        <p>When I went before the pension board in 1993, the
        person then in charge of managing the retirement office
        for Knox County -- in my presence -- told the board
        members that those going on total disability generally
        died within a year or so. It was a generalization I
        looked forward to disproving. </p>
        <p>* My cardiologist, Dr. Stuart Bresee, worked manfully
        this year to keep me alive, without a great deal of help
        from me. He has opened narrowed arteries twice since
        1993, and the last time he installed a couple of metal
        rings to hold open the offending arteries. </p>
        <p>Through the grace of God and the help of medical
        science, I hope to write a similar column this time next
        year. </p>
        <p>* Our German shepherd, Maxie, had her eighth birthday.
        Earlier in the year, she stepped in cleaning fluid and
        licked it off her paw. We had a bad scare, but Dr. James
        Sternburg at Powell Animal Hospital soon had her back on
        her feet. </p>
        <p>As I write this, Maxie is focused on a Christmas tree
        ornament that little Amanda Cutting, the daughter of our
        friends, Diana and Stuart, made. It is a dog biscuit with
        little plastic eyes and pipe-cleaner ears. Maxie won't
        touch the tree, but I think she's trying to make the
        ornament fall to the floor through force of canine will. </p>
        <p>* My son, Paris, under the competent and patient
        direction of Powell band instructors, Greg Roach and
        Terry Rozelle, took up the tenor saxophone so he could
        march at football games and play in the jazz band. </p>
        <p>He continues to take private oboe lessons from the
        lovely Rhonda Booth, but he wanted to expand his musical
        horizons. I'm glad we have teachers willing to go the
        extra mile. </p>
        <p>* With my partner, Don Williams, I took my first dip
        into the waters of book publishing with a new collection
        of police stories called ''The Archangel Caper.'' So far,
        we're still in the red financially, but hope springs
        eternal. </p>
        <p>* Cheryl and I survived an audit from the Internal
        Revenue Service. All in all, the sheer terror aside, we
        were treated very politely by a business-like auditor. </p>
        <p>For the most part, our deductions were in order. I now
        know, however, that I can't deduct business expenses for
        trips to Florida, even with proof I've written about
        them, or write off speaking fees that I don't charge for
        -- no matter what a jack-leg tax preparer may tell me. </p>
        <p>I was in good company; many of the cops I know were
        using the same creative tax preparer. The IRS examiners
        required many to cough up some back taxes but took mercy
        on our ignorance because they were familiar with the
        person who had been preparing our returns. </p>
        <p>Merry Christmas! </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        <p><font size="2"><i>By David Hunter Columnist</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">B</font>aptists -- as a rule -- believe
        that God pretty much stopped using splashy miracles by
        the end of New Testament times. </p>
        <p>The sturdy, no-nonsense denomination took root and
        spread over the early American frontier because Baptists,
        as a priesthood of believers, travel light, theologically
        speaking. </p>
        <p>They have no rigid ministerial qualifications and no
        sacraments; even baptism and the Lord's Supper (communion
        in other creeds) are done only in remembrance. If a new
        pastor is needed, the congregation hires or ordains one. </p>
        <p>Every believer is equal to every other, clergy
        included. Though there are many seminary-educated Baptist
        ministers serving huge congregations, the majority of
        Baptists churches are small; none recognize any higher
        earthly authority than the congregation. </p>
        <p>If there is a serious dispute, dissenters quite often
        leave for a fresh start somewhere else. </p>
        <p>In my lifetime, Baptist churches have split over the
        use of pianos, a certain Pentecostal hymnal,
        stained-glass windows, the particulars of a coming
        millennium, kitchens in the church and whether divorced
        men can serve as deacons and pastors -- to name a few. </p>
        <p>When news of mysterious crosses of light in a window
        at Copper Ridge Baptist Church in Halls first appeared, I
        wondered how long it would take for disorder to set in.
        It didn't take long. </p>
        <p>Eleven members of the congregation (said to have fewer
        than 40 active members) have now sued the pastor in an
        attempt to make him step down. </p>
        <p>The pastor is standing firm in his resolve to stay, as
        thousands of people from all over the world make
        pilgrimages to the little clapboard church to see the
        striking light display. </p>
        <p>Allegations of misconduct have been made, but the
        dispute boils down, I think, to a case of flashy miracles
        vs. quiet, unnoticed miracles. </p>
        <p>Now, I believe in miracles because I've seen them:
        cancer-stricken patients healed; angry, selfish people
        turned to charity and kindness; and former bigots
        embracing the entire human race with universal love. </p>
        <p>Personally, I think God operates an orderly universe
        within a framework of natural laws that include the use
        of prayer and apply to everyone (including God). I
        believe every miracle I've personally seen could be
        attributed to one of those laws, if I knew where to look.
        My miracles have never been of the flashy variety. </p>
        <p>It's only an opinion, though, not an attempt to
        dictate the anatomy of a miracle for anyone else. If
        pressed about the crosses of light at Copper Ridge
        Baptist Church, I'd have to say that I think the images
        are a combination of light, glass and perhaps chemicals
        from cleaning fluid. </p>
        <p>At the same time, I would also acknowledge that all
        miracles are in the eye and soul of the beholder. A
        healing is no less a healing if it involves antibiotics;
        love is no less love, even if we discover chemical,
        biological and sociological reasons for its existence. </p>
        <p>There is a gate through which each of us may
        comfortably commune with God. I try, in my own private,
        clumsy way, to follow after a carpenter turned rabbi from
        Nazareth. He would have worshiped with Baptists,
        Orthodox, Roman Catholics, charismatics and
        Presbyterians, just as he dined with tax collectors and
        prostitutes. </p>
        <p>My rabbi promised to be present whenever two or three
        would gather in his name. I have no doubt that he will be
        waiting at the new building in the likely event that a
        splinter congregation breaks off from Copper Ridge
        Baptist Church and goes on its own. </p>
        <p>God -- I am certain -- will start where we are and
        work with what we are capable of giving to bring order
        out of apparent chaos. </p>
        <p>You can quote me on that. </p>

<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he weather can go ahead and turn nasty because I am laden with all the supplies necessary for winter survival.
<P>   (No, not toilet paper, bread, beer and eggs. Like 4,738,239 of my closest and dearest friends, I am well-stocked from the previous snow warning. Besides, I like to wait until the very last minute after bad weather is forecast before driving to the grocery store. That way, I am assured of getting the freshest products possible. Assuming 1973 vintage is considered fresh.)
<P>   Now, where was I? Oh, yes: The really important supplies I&#39;m talking about -- the ones that will see me through the darkest, dreariest days of January and February -- are spring catalogs.
<P>   They have been arriving in profusion. I have received four this week alone. Two for fishing equipment, one for garden supplies, one for general merchandise. By the time you read this column, I&#39;ll probably get two or three more.
<P>   I have no idea why these companies continue to flirt with me, for I hardly ever buy from them. I&#39;ll bet I don&#39;t place one order for every 25 catalogs that come to my house. But as a patriotic American, I try to do my part for tree-killing.
<P>   Most people browse through a spring seed catalog or a spring fishing catalog and start daydreaming of balmy mornings in May when, equipped with the latest tools or lures, they can attack the soil or the water with renewed passion.
<P>   Not me. Even if I spent $5,000 on all that junk, the weeds would still flourish in my garden and I would still come home from the lake skunked.
<P>   Instead, I enjoy looking at catalogs through the eyes of a writer to see how a mundane item like a vegetable seed or a bass bait can be described over and over, page after page, year after year, and never sound the same.
<P>   I am soooo envious of this skill.
<P>   Consider cucumbers. If I was writing the catalog, I would say something like, &#39;&#39;These are elongated, green veggies that grow on a vine. They can be eaten fresh or pickled. Some people use them in sandwiches, but I don&#39;t recommend the practice.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Yet the 1997 Burpee catalog devotes 11 photographs and approximately 600 words on pages 62 and 63 to describe 15 varieties of the crazy things.
<P>   As far as I can tell, the Early Pride Hybrid looks just like the Fanfare Hybrid. But, according to the catalog writers, the Early Pride Hybrid &#39;&#39;bears huge crops of gorgeous cukes; harvest starts early and keeps on producing for many weeks; dark green fruits are 81/2 inches by 2 inches with crisp, juicy flesh; plants are powdery mildew and mosaic tolerant,&#39;&#39; while the Fanfare Hybrid &#39;&#39;has it all: great taste, compact plants and excellent disease resistance to keep the harvest going; straight 8-9 inch cukes are dark green and extremely uniform.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Same thing with plastic worms. With me at the keyboard, these would be &#39;&#39;colored, flavored plastic strips that look like nothing you actually see in the water, but bass will bite them.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Now look at pages 28, 32, 33, 34, 35 and 42 of Cabela&#39;s 1997 spring fishing catalog. Here are more than 50 photos and Izaak-Walton-only-knows-how-many words about plastic worms, eels, minnows, grubs, lizards, tadpoles and leeches in a rainbow of colors.
<P>   According to the catalog, Zoom plastic worms &#39;&#39;have been fooling bass for years. Fish will often literally fight just to hang onto one of the Zoom offerings because of the feel and taste.&#39;&#39; And just one column away, here&#39;s what the catalog says about Berkley Tournament Strength Power Worms: &#39;&#39;Two times the power in the world&#39;s best bass worm! Twice the amount found in regular Power Worms! Tournament Strength Power Worms are guaranteed to give you that extra edge to catch big bass.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Amazing. Where do these people find the verbiage to fill all this space? Is there a word mine somewhere, with thick, rich seams of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs that spew from the ground and tumble into railcars by the ton?

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>New book about Tennessee trivia tickles the fancy</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Sam Venable News-Sentinel Columnist</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>ne lesson you learn early in the writing business is to be cautious of adjectives like &#39;&#39;largest&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;longest&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;deepest&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;highest&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;heaviest.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Just as sure as you drop one of these words into a story, the telephone will ring and you&#39;ll get an earful about something that is larger, longer, deeper, higher or heavier. Never fails.
<P>   That&#39;s why Ken Beck is holding his breath these days.
<P>   Beck, an entertainment editor for The Tennessean in Nashville, is the author of a new book on interesting tidbits about our state. A veteran of two decades in the newspaper business, he knows the pitfalls of largest-longest claims and has made every effort to separate fact from fiction.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I verified every entry at least twice,&#39;&#39; he told me. &#39;&#39;Thus far, there have been no challenges.&#39;&#39;
<P>   (Naturally, I had to play Mr. Nitpick and point out a mistake. In a mention about country music legend Roy Acuff, Beck talks about Roy&#39;s hometown of &#39;&#39;Maynardsville.&#39;&#39; I told Ken it doesn&#39;t have an &#39;&#39;s&#39;&#39;, an error that seems to occur more and more. A couple of months ago, a radio commercial kept referring to a new drug store in &#39;&#39;Maynardsville,&#39;&#39; but considering the spokeswoman&#39;s voice was decidedly Yankeeze in accent and volume, I let it pass.)
<P>   &#39;&#39;I got a scare a couple of days ago when someone from Arkansas reported a &#39;world record&#39; watermelon,&#39;&#39; said Beck. &#39;&#39;It was something like 250 pounds. That&#39;s not even close. A Tennessean holds the record at 262 pounds. He&#39;s Bill Carson of Arrington, and he grew it back in 1990.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Beck&#39;s book, &#39;&#39;Terrific Tennessee,&#39;&#39; (Premium Press America, $6.95) is a short, fun read containing 509 nuggets of Volunteer trivia. He gleaned the information out of library reference books, encyclopedias, histories, almanacs, magazines and news wire stories and by chasing down off-beat tips.
<P>   For instance, did you know there&#39;s a lodge just outside of Knoxville that caters strictly to bikers?
<P>   It&#39;s the Shiloh Motor Hotel in Seymour.
<P>   To double-check Beck, I called directory information and made my own inquiry. Owner Joe Thomas confirmed that you gotta arrive by motorcycle to get a room at his place. It&#39;s located off Chapman Highway on 50 acres of farmland. The place has been in business four years, Thomas said, although it&#39;s closed for the season right now. Opens back up in April.
<P>   Another Knoxvillism I was unaware of: In 1913, we became the only city in the world with mailboxes on city streets and streetcars.
<P>   And another: The first novel printed in Tennessee was &#39;&#39;Woodville&#39;&#39; in 1832 by Charles Todd.
<P>   And one more: The fastest mile ever recorded by a four-man team while walking on hands took place March 15, 1987, in Knoxville when David Lutterman, Danny Scannell, Phillip Savage and Brendan Price covered the distance in 24 minutes, 48 seconds.
<P>   This isn&#39;t the largest, longest, deepest, highest or heaviest trivia book I&#39;ve ever read. But it just might be the best.

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Zero tolerance seems to include zero rationality</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Sam Venable News-Sentinel Columnist</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">Y</FONT>ears from now, when chroniclers of American history sit down to write about the final decade of the 20th century, they are sure to spend time on the &#39;&#39;zero tolerance&#39;&#39; weapons policy in public schools.
<P>   I can only imagine what they&#39;ll say. Perhaps something on the order of:
<P>   &#39;&#39;In a wave of hysteria not seen since the McCarthy era, school administrators from coast to coast enacted sweeping regulations that resulted in the senseless expulsion of some students every year. The practice reached its pinnacle in 1999 when Jimmy Winchester, 6, of Frostbite Falls, N.H., was denied admission to the first grade because his name was the same as that of a firearms manufacturing company. Nervous administrators, fearing other students might be frightened to hear &#39;there&#39;s a Winchester in Mrs. Smith&#39;s class&#39; barred Jimmy until his name was legally changed. The Winchester family filed suit. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, and in a landmark decision, justices unanimously demanded school boards use the common sense God gave a goat.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The situation won&#39;t play out like that, of course. That&#39;s too logical. From what I&#39;ve been reading of &#39;&#39;zero tolerance&#39;&#39; in recent months, logic -- not to mention reason and common sense -- have no role in the equation.
<P>   Pick a city, any city, and you&#39;ll find ample evidence of a well-intentioned policy gone haywire.
<P>   It might be in Knoxville, where 17-year-old Powell High student Dustin Seal was expelled after a friend&#39;s knife was found in the glove compartment of his car at a football game. Or it might be in Seattle, Wash., where 10-year-old Jeffrey Parks got kicked out for bringing a one-inch-long, plastic G.I. Joe gun to school.
<P>   I understand the predicament this makes for school administrators. They&#39;ve got to take a tough stance against weapons in school. If not, the lives of students and teachers are at stake, and the potential for lawsuits mushrooms.
<P>   But relevancy is sorely missing. And until it returns, this situation can do nothing but worsen.
<P>   How farfetched will things get before we come back to our senses?
<P>   The game of baseball, with its dangerous wooden sticks and rock-hard spheres of warfare, will certainly become a memory in athletics.
<P>   Each campus will also be purged of aluminum cans, eating utensils and anything else that might possibly be fashioned into a knife.
<P>   Indeed, officials will comb the grounds at every facility, square foot by square foot, to make sure all slivers of broken glass and stones larger than a dime are safely removed from dangerous hands.
<P>   But wait! There&#39;s an even more illogical way to solve this problem. It&#39;s so ludicrous, I&#39;m surprised nobody has proposed it yet:
<P>   Require all students, K-12, to attend school nude. We&#39;re talking buck nekkid, head to toe.
<P>   Not only does this eliminate hiding places for weapons, it gets administrators off the hook about having to teach sex education. And the kids will absolutely love it.
<P>   This is a bureaucrat&#39;s dream. Look for it soon on your local school board&#39;s agenda.

<FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT>ori Wilson, marketing director of Knoxville&#39;s Computer Learning Center, found a unique letter in her e-mail box a few days ago.
<P>   It was a message from her 8-year-old niece, Sara Sipes, who lives in Norman, Okla.
<P>   Sara wanted to know if good ol&#39; Aunt Lori was interested in buying some Girl Scout cookies.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Sara sent the same message to all her aunts and uncles -- here in Knoxville, as well as Cincinnati, Lexington, and Danville, Ky.,&#39;&#39; said Wilson.
<P>   &#39;&#39;She did a good job. Her letter included a complete description for each type of cookie, how many were in each box and the price. There was a major sympathetic appeal too -- she told how many boxes she hoped to sell to earn her way to camp.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Naturally, it worked.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I ordered 10 boxes,&#39;&#39; said Wilson. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve never bought Girl Scout cookies from Sara before. I mean, she lives all the way out in Oklahoma! She&#39;s supposed to mail them to me.&#39;&#39;
<P>   I asked about postage.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Hmmm. We never did discuss that,&#39;&#39; Wilson answered. &#39;&#39;Maybe Sara will give me the family rate.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Cybercookies. I never thought I&#39;d live to see the day.
<P>   It&#39;s one thing for gap-toothed Brownies to come door-to-door or hit you up at church, at the office, at the grocery store or in front of the local shopping mall. But to hawk their mint, vanilla cream, coconut and chocolate chip goodies crosscountry by computer? Heaven -- and Juliette Gordon Low -- help us.
<P>   Shouldn&#39;t these little scoutettes be off somewhere tying knots, practicing first aid or weaving baskets?
<P>   Then again, maybe enterprising young women like Sara are onto something bigger than merit badges and two free weeks at Camp Winnehohonakawampus.
<P>   Maybe they have unlocked the key to guilt-free snacking, liberating countless millions of tubbos, Los Angeles to Manhattan, from the shackles of sweet tooth sin: Virtual reality cookies.
<P>   Yum-yum. I can almost taste these nuggets right now.
<P>   It&#39;s a perfect plan. No more ruined diet plans. No more pigging out before meals, after meals and between meals. No more promising yourself to eat just one itty-bitty thin mint at bedtime and then polishing off the entire box.
<P>   Instead, all you gotta do is pour a glass of cold milk, sit down at your computer, punch a few keys, (enter the all-important credit card number, of course) and then let your body be washed in virtual sensuous bliss.
<P>   You can virtually watch as the ingredients come together to make the dough, virtually smell the cookies as they emerge from the oven, virtually unwrap the cellophane sleeve, virtually hold each delicate morsel in your hand and virtually pop them, one by one, into your virtual mouth.
<P>   I&#39;m so excited, I might rub two wires together and build a campfire.

<!--SUBHEAD-->        <p><font size="2"><i>By Sam Venable News-Sentinel
        Columnist</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">L</font>ike millions of other Americans, I
        recently received a package of information from Dorothy
        Addeo, contest manager for Publishers Clearing House. </p>
        <p>And like all those other folks, I was told my name had
        been selected as a finalist for the $10 million jackpot
        to be given away next Sunday. </p>
        <p>Won't happen. I'm not going to return the necessary
        paperwork. I'm supposed to have everything back to
        Publishers Clearing House by Tuesday, but in the famous
        words of former President Bush, ''Not gonna'do it!'' </p>
        <p>How come? </p>
        <p>First is Dorothy's gushy letter telling me I'd been
        ''approved'' to win the money. In it, Dorothy says I have
        met certain ''selection criteria.'' </p>
        <p>What does that mean -- that I breathe and have a body
        temperature of 98.6? </p>
        <p>There's another gem in her note: ''We'd like nothing
        better than to see our endorsed candidate Sam Venable
        walk off with the big prize.'' </p>
        <p>You really mean that, Dorothy? You're not teasing me,
        are you? You didn't say the same thing to the bazillion
        other people who got a sweepstakes letter? </p>
        <p>Tell you what, Dorothy. If you sincerely want me to
        have the cash, just skip the formalities. Send me a
        cashier's check for $10 million, and I'll write the
        sweetest, warmest thank-you note this side of Miss
        Manners. </p>
        <p>One other thing. In the package I received, there's an
        official release I'm supposed to sign. It's called the
        ''location approval.'' </p>
        <p>What a hoot. This thing shows several frames of TV
        pictures that depict how I'll react when I win the
        jackpot. </p>
        <p>In one of the photos, a man from the prize patrol is
        saying, ''Congratulations, Sam Venable. You've just won
        10 million dollars!'' </p>
        <p>In the next picture, there's a guy I presume is me. He
        is saying something incredibly nerdy: ''I can't believe
        it. I guess I'm rich now!'' </p>
        <p>Wrong, Dorothy. A thousand times wrong. </p>
        <p>That's not the way I would behave if a stranger walked
        up to my front door on a Sunday afternoon and announced
        I'd just won a fortune. </p>
        <p>I'd be on the ground, laughing my guts out, wondering
        which one of my friends was trying to pull a trick. Then
        I'd probably sputter out something like: </p>
        <p>''Ten million bucks? Yeah, right. C'mon, tell me --
        who put you up to this? It was Lem Wiggins, wasn't it? </p>
        <p>''Whee! This is almost as good as the night Lem threw
        a party before the UT-Alabama football game, and some
        Alabama cheerleaders showed up. They gave a couple of
        cheers and then shucked off their uniforms, right down to
        their shoes. Turned out they weren't Bama cheerleaders at
        all. They were strippers Lem had hired. Man, what a
        wild-dog party that was! </p>
        <p>''Go back and tell Lem I died of a heart attack when I
        heard about winning $10 million. Tell him Mary Ann has
        already gotten hold of our lawyer and the cops have a
        warrant for his arrest. That crazy idiot will love it.'' </p>
        <p>By the way, Dorothy. You weren't one of those
        strippers, were you? </p>

        <font size="5">N</font>otes and quotes on news of the
        day: </p>
        <p>1 * Back in 1995, when President Clinton loaned Mexico
        $20 billion to avert an economic crisis in that country,
        his critics were furious. You may recall that former
        presidential candidate Pat Buchanan termed it ''daylight
        robbery of the nation's wealth'' and said this was money
        ''American taxpayers will never see again.'' </p>
        <p>But a funny thing happened on the way to ruination.
        Last week, Mexico paid off the debt -- three years ahead
        of schedule -- along with $580 million in interest. </p>
        <p>Yes, children. For once in his life, Uncle Sam entered
        into a financial agreement and actually made money. You
        know, like a bank does it. </p>
        <p>How odd if this silly notion took root and flourished
        in Washington. </p>
        <p>Worry not. Congress will make certain such foolishness
        never gets out of hand. </p>
        <p>* Another fund-raiser: Mayhaps we should follow the
        lead of courts in Turkey. </p>
        <p>A judge in Ankara recently levied a $20,000 fine
        against Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller for slandering
        Justice Minister Sevket Kazan. According to testimony,
        Ciller was giving a speech and said Kazan was ''without
        honor or national pride.'' This, the court ruled, was an
        insult worthy of the huge fine. </p>
        <p>Imagine the flow of cash in America if that same
        standard was applied every time our politicians got in
        front of a microphone and ripped each other. Poof! No
        national debt. </p>
        <p>* You probably haven't seen evidence of it yet, but
        the Coca-Cola company is changing the design on one of
        its leading products. </p>
        <p>According to the Associated Press, the company has
        erased the vertical white ribbon on cans of Classic Coke
        and altered the wording design. The Coca-Cola logo will
        now be almost horizontal instead of vertical. </p>
        <p>The new look has been introduced in Chicago, New York,
        Atlanta and other cities. You should see changes
        elsewhere within two months. </p>
        <p>This is being done without any hint of fanfare. With
        good reason. After that New Coke disaster, the word
        ''change'' has presumably been deleted from Coca-Cola's
        corporate vocabulary. </p>
        <p>* And speaking of headaches in the ol' boardroom, I
        can only imagine the marketing experts at Burger King are
        rethinking -- again -- their latest advertising campaign.
        </p>
        <p>You remember Burger King's old ''Have it your way''
        appeal? </p>
        <p>That's apparently what Carl Berthelot had in mind when
        he entered a Burger King in Gonzales, La., and ordered a
        hamburger without onions. </p>
        <p>He got onions. </p>
        <p>According to police reports, Berthelot confronted the
        manager. A food fight erupted. And before you could say,
        ''Hold the pickle, hold the lettuce, special orders don't
        upset us,'' Berthelot threw a punch and busted the
        manager's glasses. He was booked on charges of battery
        and disturbing the peace. </p>
        <p>Guess what Burger King's current slogan is? </p>
        <p>Yep, that's right. ''Double vision.'' </p>
        <p>* It's a good thing Leonso Canales lives in Texas
        instead of Tennessee. </p>
        <p>As you may have read in your favorite morning
        newspaper a few days ago, Canales is the 56-year-old flea
        market operator who convinced Kleberg County
        commissioners to adopt a new official courthouse greeting
        in his hometown of Kingsville. </p>
        <p>Canales was bothered by the fact that ''hello''
        contains the word ''hell.'' He launched a three-year
        campaign to purge the word and replace it with
        ''heaveno'' as a symbol of ''peace, friendship and
        welcome'' in the current ''age of anxiety.'' </p>
        <p>Imagine the anxiety Canales would experience if he
        moved to East Tennessee and discovered a language riddled
        daily with nasty expressions like ''Douglas Dam,''
        ''Norris Dam,'' ''Watts Bar Dam'' and a few dozen more
        ''dams.'' </p>
        <p>Do you suppose we should be calling them ''darns,''
        ''dangs'' or ''durns?'' </p>
        <p>I'll be da-, er, I mean, uh -- helifino. </p>

        <font size="5">M</font>usings from near and far as we sip
        another cup of eggnog and ponder anew the question that
        crosses our mind every Christmas season: What the heck is
        figgy pudding anyway? </p>
        <p>* Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of the Interior, recently
        presented a ''corporate wildlife stewardship'' award to a
        company for its leadership role in protecting endangered
        species. </p>
        <p>Babbitt praised the company for being -- I quote
        directly from a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service dispatch
        -- ''among the first to provide practical solutions that
        allow us to enjoy a healthy environment while promoting
        economic growth.'' </p>
        <p>Mr. Secretary went on to say that this company ''has
        worked with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and its
        counterpart state agencies to develop solutions that
        protect wildlife . . . .'' </p>
        <p>Wow. What a caring company. In this day of the evil
        corporate empire, it does my heart good to discover there
        is a conglomerate with an environmental conscience. </p>
        <p>Just what is the name of this leader? </p>
        <p>How about ''Champion International.'' </p>
        <p>Yes, Virginia. The same Champion International whose
        paper mill in North Carolina has been fouling the Pigeon
        River for most of this century. The same Champion
        International that received another EPA wastewater
        permit, despite objections from everyone in Tennessee
        government from the governor on down. </p>
        <p>Oh, well. I suppose when human beings achieve
        ''endangered species'' status along the Pigeon River,
        Champion International will come to their rescue. And
        maybe receive another award from the government. </p>
        <p>Hel-LO, Washington! Any intelligent life out there? </p>
        <p>* Now that your blood is simmering, consider this
        verse from a recent newsletter of the Smoky Mountain
        Gator Club, the University of Florida's local booster
        organization. </p>
        <p>To the tune of You-Know-What: </p>
        <p>Once we had a coach on Rocky Crock, </p>
        <p>Some people called him Phat Phil. </p>
        <p>He always helped us out on Rocky Crock, </p>
        <p>And we all dream of him still. </p>
        <p>(Chorus) Rocky Crock, you'll always be, </p>
        <p>Second in the S.E.C. </p>
        <p>Poor old Rocky Crock, </p>
        <p>Rocky Crock, Tennessee. </p>
        <p>Once they thought they had a quarterback, </p>
        <p>Plucked him from a good family tree. </p>
        <p>But when it came to winning championships, </p>
        <p>He was zero to three. </p>
        <p>(Chorus) </p>
        <p>Over a hundred-thousand people came </p>
        <p>And sat in the Rocky Crock house. </p>
        <p>When the Gators finished eating them, </p>
        <p>They were as quiet as a mouse. </p>
        <p>Well, the words DO rhyme, although the beat -- I use
        the term ever-so-loosely -- is jerkier than Ernest P.
        Worrell on speed. </p>
        <p>But, as they say down at the jock dorm, ''facts is
        facts.'' Florida's drubbing streak against Tennessee
        would wear out the Energizer bunny. </p>
        <p>* Just when you think bureaucratese has replaced
        English as America's official language, along comes a
        delightful renegade. </p>
        <p>Brian Muirhead, flight systems manager of NASA's Jet
        Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., had this to
        say about problems with a sun sensor on the Mars
        Pathfinder: The sensor became ''contaminated in some
        way,'' he told reporters. ''Something is preventing the
        light going through it, like somebody ate candy and
        licked your sunglasses.'' </p>
        <p>NASA corrected the problem. And I hope Muirhead gets a
        medal for common sense. </p>
        <p>* Did you see the Louis Harris and Associates poll
        about how Americans feel about journalists? The poll
        where most people think we in the news business are
        ''arrogant'' and ''less compassionate''? </p>
        <p>Hey! Who asked those jerks, anyway? </p>
        <p>Sorry. I just couldn't resist that. Please accept this
        yummy bowl of figgy pudding as a gesture of my sincere
        humility. </p>

        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">I</font> was in Orlando, Fla., a few years
        ago to visit my daughter who was interning at Walt Disney
        World. One afternoon while she helped Mickey Mouse make
        more money, I took a long walk around her apartment
        complex. </p>
        <p>At first glance, this was your stereotypic, stuccoed,
        tile-roofed, palm-treed hangout for Florida
        twenty-somethings. There was the obligatory pool and
        tennis court, each designed for social gatherings instead
        of geezer activities like swimming and tennis. Plus acres
        of asphalt -- lined-off, numbered and speed-bumped. </p>
        <p>But as I neared one intersection, something caught my
        eye behind a row of oleander bushes. I stepped to the
        edge of the sidewalk, peered through the foliage and saw
        a small marsh. </p>
        <p>I'm relying on memory here, but I'd guess the thing
        was roughly two or three times the size of the floor plan
        of a typical suburban house. Yet it was a full-fledged
        wetland. </p>
        <p>Red-winged blackbirds called from the cattails and
        willows. Wading birds stalked small fish and frogs in the
        shallows. Dragonflies skittered hither and yon. I heard
        the quiet ''szzchweep'' of a drake mallard and, cutting
        my eyes skyward, watched the greenhead coast in on
        motionless wings and settle gently on the surface of the
        water. </p>
        <p>In the midst of Metropolis? </p>
        <p>You better believe it. And the more I walked around
        the apartment complex, the more of these mini-marshes I
        found, each teeming with plants, fish and wildlife.
        Because of their location, they surely had been created
        as part of the apartment construction. I have no idea how
        many of these little refuges exist in the Orlando area,
        but if my daughter's complex is typical, they have to
        make a significant contribution to the native flora and
        fauna of that bustling tourist region. </p>
        <p>I mention that episode in hopes the two factions in
        the Turkey Creek wetland fight might make a sincere
        effort to find common ground. </p>
        <p>Surely you've heard of this controversy. It centers
        around a piece of marshy land in West Knox County that
        developers want to use for an extension to Parkside Drive
        and environmentalists want to preserve. Although I'm not
        intimately familiar with the fine print, I'm here to tell
        you a compromise is possible. </p>
        <p>No, not a win-win for everyone. But not a lose-lose
        either. </p>
        <p>Since this is the Christmas season, let me propose a
        wish list: </p>
        <p>I wish the pro-development side would drop the ''tree
        hugger'' and ''mosquito factory'' slurs and realize a lot
        of fine folks, who may or may not live in West Knoxville,
        are genuinely concerned about Mother Earth. Further, I
        wish the pro-developers would admit this is a NIMBY thing
        for them; everybody wants strict air and water law
        enforcement (do the words ''Pigeon River'' ring a bell?),
        just as long as their particular factory, highway plan,
        subdivision project or other high-dollar deal isn't
        stifled by them. I also wish the pro-developers would
        quit harping on the fact that the Turkey Creek wetland
        didn't used to be wet; geophysical changes constantly
        occur, by the hand of humans or not. And finally, I wish
        the pro-developers would understand that because American
        wetlands -- which are far from ''wastelands'' -- have
        been drained with reckless abandon for two centuries, the
        precious few remaining ones are that much more valuable. </p>
        <p>As for the environmentalists, I wish they would
        understand that not every piece of ''wildlife habitat''
        has to be vast, uncharted wilderness; the burgeoning deer
        population in Knox County is proof alone. Further, I wish
        they would realize that these developers have, as best I
        can tell, gone above and beyond the call of duty to
        soften the negative impact on the ecosystem. What's more,
        I wish they would appreciate that business interests,
        whether driven by conscience or regulation, are more
        willing than ever to incorporate wildlife mitigation into
        their plans instead of merely cranking up the bulldozers.
        </p>
        <p>Despite what you hear from both camps, this is not a
        black-white issue. There is an abundance of gray, if
        either side is willing to notice. </p>

        <font size="5">I</font>'m going to tell you a story
        that's 121/2 years old. In the business of daily
        newspapering, this is ancient history. </p>
        <p>But it's not ancient to Dewey Wyrick. The events are
        as fresh in his mind right now as they were the June
        morning in 1984 when he met, alive and in the flesh,
        Santa Claus. </p>
        <p>Wyrick is an artist who lives in Rockford. You may
        remember his tender ''Storyteller'' portrait that was
        quite popular during the Tennessee Homecoming '86
        celebration. </p>
        <p>A copy of that painting is reproduced here. See the
        little girl sitting on her ''grandfather's'' lap? That's
        Wyrick's own daughter, Brooke, who is now a senior at the
        Webb School. The lad with the coonskin cap is an amalgam
        of the generic ''boy next door.'' </p>
        <p>But the old guy with the flowing white hair and beard?
        That's Santa. </p>
        <p>''That was his real name -- Santa C. Claus,'' says
        Wyrick. ''He had a driver's license and Social Security
        card to prove it.'' </p>
        <p>At one time, the man was known as LeRoy Scholtz. He
        had his name legally changed to Santa Claus in 1980. He
        lived in New York and worked for a modeling agency.
        Wyrick still has some old newspaper and magazine ads
        featuring Scholtz in his Santa attire. They're realistic
        enough to make you believe all over again. </p>
        <p>Scholtz/Santa came into Wyrick's life that June
        morning in '84 as he was working on a drawing of the Old
        Mill in Pigeon Forge. </p>
        <p>''He just walked up and started a conversation,''
        Wyrick recalled. ''Said he liked my work because it
        featured children. To be honest, I thought he was some
        kind of nut at first. Here it was the middle of summer,
        and he had on a long-sleeved shirt with Christmas
        decorations. His car even had a reindeer painted on the
        side.'' </p>
        <p>Santa gave Wyrick a photo of himself and his
        grandchildren and asked the artist to reproduce it.
        That's exactly what he did, creating a mock-up of what
        would later serve as the basis of his Homecoming piece. </p>
        <p>Wyrick tried to contact the old man and set up a
        promotional tour. Despite leaving messages at talent
        agencies, all he got were dead ends. </p>
        <p>''When I finally reached him, he was ill and somewhat
        incoherent,'' Wyrick said. ''I cancelled my production
        plans and altered the faces in my painting.'' </p>
        <p>The Homecoming portrait and poster were released in
        November 1985 and were well-received. Just one month
        later, however, Wyrick got word that Santa had died, sick
        and alone, in a Chicago hotel. The story ran in
        newspapers all over the country, including The
        News-Sentinel. </p>
        <p>Wyrick donated part of the proceeds from the sale of
        the poster to East Tennessee Children's Hospital and the
        Christian Academy of Knoxville. </p>
        <p>Said the artist: ''I always felt this would've made
        Santa happy.'' </p>

        <p>Radioactive. Cancer-causing. Potentially deadly.
        Invisible. Odorless. Colorless. Tasteless. </p>
        <p>This is radon. </p>
        <p>The gas is a silent menace that lurks underground,
        seeps into houses and other structures and threatens the
        unsuspecting. </p>
        <p>While the gas can be easily detected and prevented
        from flowing into homes and other buildings, many home
        and property owners don't know this and could succumb to
        the effects of the gas if it exists in dangerous levels. </p>
        <p>Consider that radon is: </p>
        <p>Estimated to be the second leading cause of lung
        cancer and lung cancer deaths (after tobacco smoking) in
        the United States. </p>
        <p>Estimated to cause about 14,000 deaths a year because
        of lung cancer </p>
        <p>Estimated to exist in one out of every 15 homes in the
        U.S. at or above the Environmental Protection Agency's
        recommended level of 4 picocuries per liter of air
        (pCi/L) on a yearly average. </p>
        <p>The existence of radon in a home or other building can
        be detected easily and inexpensively, and the problem can
        be corrected likewise. </p>

</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Stephanie Spellers, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">H</FONT>undreds marched down Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue Sunday afternoon for a different kind of civil rights demonstration.
<P>   &#39;&#39;In a parade like this, we are making a demonstration of our unity, whatever our race, gender, class or physical ability,&#39;&#39; Mark Rigsby said. &#39;&#39;This is our tribute to peace, our tribute to justice.&#39;&#39;
<P>   It was Knoxville&#39;s tribute to slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., organized by the King Commemoration Commission.
<P>   Today is the official holiday honoring King&#39;s birthday, but the commission scheduled its celebration for Sunday in deference to the presidential inauguration. Had King lived, he would have been 68.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There&#39;s a whole new generation out there, and we need to get them to see what King was about,&#39;&#39; said Rigsby, who served on the commission. &#39;&#39;He is still a role model for how we all can live, and we need to have symposiums and celebrations to remember.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The commission sponsored activities throughout the week -- a symposium to discuss affirmative action, an awards banquet honoring local businesses and organizations, a youth symposium -- but the highlights were still the parade and a memorial service later Sunday night featuring the Rev. Benjamin Hooks, the former NAACP executive director.
<P>   Vernita Nevels brought her grandchildren to the parade to witness the show of unity and commitment. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s important to see young and old carrying out the dream of Dr. King, the dream of unity for all people,&#39;&#39; she said.
<P>   Dozens of local churches, community groups and school bands from all parts of the city bundled up to march from Tabernacle Baptist Church to Greater Warner Tabernacle AME Zion Church.
<P>   But Nevels said it takes more than one day of unity to meet the challenge King set forth.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We have not lived out the message he left for us,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;We must talk to our young people, let them know what he lived for.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Young people at the parade agreed. Jamesa Barkley, 14, said her generation needs to remember the lessons King died for.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It seems like we&#39;re getting lost,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;You&#39;ve got black people killing black people where it used to be white killing black. We don&#39;t seem to get along, and I don&#39;t think he&#39;d like that.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Even as they recognized the distance America has yet to travel, parade participants said there is much to celebrate. That&#39;s what the holiday is all about.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I love the sense of camaraderie here today,&#39;&#39; said the Rev. Lynn Strauss, minister at Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church. &#39;&#39;We need this opportunity to stop, pay attention to the call for today and for tomorrow. Dr. King was always a man of the future. . . . He&#39;s passed that banner on to us.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The commemoration wrapped up Sunday evening with a memorial service at Greater Warner Tabernacle AME Zion Church. Hooks, a Memphis native and former head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was the keynote speaker.
<P>    Hooks has served as pastor for Greater Middle Baptist Church in Memphis for 41 years and teaches at Fisk University, but he is best known for his 16 years of service as executive director for the NAACP, one of the nation&#39;s premier civil rights organization.
<P>   The Hooks address will be broadcast from 11 to 1 p.m. today on WSJK, Channel 2 and WKOP, Channel 15.

        dominance over health programs<br>
        </b></font><font size="2"><i><br>
        By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">W</font>ASHINGTON (AP) -- Three out of
        four insured U.S. workers got health coverage through
        managed care in 1995, a dramatic jump in two years fueled
        by both small businesses and self-insured large
        companies, a study released Sunday said. </p>
        <p>In 1993, about half the Americans insured through
        employers were in managed care. That jumped to 73 percent
        by 1995, according to an article in the journal Health
        Affairs, published by Project Hope. </p>
        <p>''Managed care isn't coming,'' the article concluded.
        ''It has arrived.'' Traditional, fee-for-service plans
        served just over a quarter of workers in 1995, down from
        almost half two years earlier. </p>
        <p>Managed care has helped stem the double-digit
        inflation inflicting health-care costs in the late 1980s
        and early 1990s. Since then, most companies have been
        pushing their workers into managed care, which restrains
        costs by emphasizing preventative medicine, closely
        scrutinizing treatment and cutting out medical care
        considered unnecessary. </p>
        <p>Subscribers agree to limits on available doctors. </p>
        <p>Some groups have made dramatic recent shifts to
        managed care, according to the article, which based its
        findings on a survey of 2,037 employers by KPMG Peat
        Marwick and Wayne State University. They include: </p>
        <p>--Small businesses, which in 1993 enrolled 78 percent
        of employees in conventional, fee-for-service coverage.
        By 1995, that dropped to 31 percent. </p>
        <p>Many small businesses added a managed-care option for
        the first time or, more dramatically, replaced its single
        traditional plan with a managed-care program. Those that
        switched tended to have higher-than-average deductibles
        and premiums in their old plans. </p>
        <p>--Self-insured plans, operated by large companies and
        providing most of the business for traditional
        fee-for-service plans. But managed care now covers 61
        percent of employees in these plans, up from 33 percent
        in 1991. </p>
        <p>--Point-of-service. Managed care saw its most dramatic
        increases in point-of-service plans, which served 20
        percent of workers in 1995, up from 9 percent in 1993. </p>
        <p>Point-of-service programs give more generous benefits
        if patients chose their doctors from a predetermined list
        of choices. They may see other providers, but it costs
        them more. </p>
        <p>Health maintenance organizations went from serving 22
        percent to 28 percent of workers. Preferred provider
        organizations increased from 20 percent to 25 percent. </p>
        <p>Conventional plans dropped from 49 percent to 27
        percent. </p>

<h3>Ruttman bumps Sprague out of NASCAR truck series win </h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>    <B>Joe Ruttman,</B> without a NASCAR truck series victory last season, opened this one by winning a thrilling last-lap shootout with <B>Jack Sprague </B>on Sunday at Lake Buena Vista, Fla.
<P>    Ruttman drove his Ford to the inside of the Chevrolet of Sprague as they began the last lap of the $544,134 Chevy Trucks Challenge race at Walt Disney World Speedway. Their trucks slammed together, Sprague spun out and Ruttman went on to a victory worth $55,500, his first since Sept. 25, 1995.
<P>    Ruttman&#39;s victory margin was 0.542-seconds over <B>Butch Miller,</B> who also drove a Ford. Sprague wound up 15th and was the final driver to complete the 200-lap distance.
<P>
<P><h3>College football</h3>
<P>
<P>* Mississippi State punter <B>Andy Russ,</B> who hadn&#39;t kicked a field goal since high school, booted four to lead the South to a 26-13 over the North in the Hula Bowl. Russ converted field goals of 42, 47, 28 and 31 yards. He was named most valuable player of the South team. USC quarterback <B>Brad Otton</B> and Fresno State&#39;s <B>Jim Arellanes</B> passed for touchdowns as the South took a 20-0 halftime lead. The South&#39;s defense was also able to overpower an undermanned North offensive line missing three players to sack North quarterback <B>Steve Sarkisian</B> of Brigham Young four times. Heisman Trophy winner <B>Danny Weurffel</B> of Florida, bothered by a sore right shoulder, played just the opening series for the South.
<P>
<P><h3>Soccer
<P></h3>
<P><B></B><B>Alberto Garcia Aspe</B> scored in the second half and assisted on <B>Zague&#39;s</B> first-half goal as Mexico beat the United States 2-0 in a U.S. Cup &#39;97 match at the Rose Bowl. It was Mexico&#39;s first win against the Americans in the United States since 1974.
<P>
<P><h3>Boxing</h3>
<P>
<P><B></B><B>Oscar De La Hoya,</B> using a punishing left jab to set the tone for the fight, dominated formerly unbeaten <B>Miguel Angel Gonzalez </B>for 12 rounds Saturday night at Las Vegas to keep the 140-pound title he won from <B>Julio Cesar Chavez.</B> De La Hoya never could put the game challenger down, but turned in a masterful boxing performance using mainly his left hand to win a lopsided 12-round decision in his first fight since beating Chavez seven months ago. De La Hoya likely will meet WBC welterweight champ <B>Pernell Whitaker</B> on April 12.
<P><B></B><B></B>Also on the card,<B> Konstantin Tszyu</B> retained his IBF version of the title in a bizarre technical draw with <B>Leonardo Mas</B>. Tszyu, a former Russian amateur champion now living in Australia, knocked Mas down twice before a final left hand seemed to finish him at the end of the first round. But referee <B>Joe Cortez</B> ruled he had accidentally hit on the break, and, under IBF rules the right was ruled a draw.
<P>
<P><h3>Baseball</h3>
<P>
<P><B></B>All-Star catcher <B>Ivan Rodriguez</B> and the Texas Rangers reached agreement on the richest one-year contract ever in baseball, a $6.65 million deal that enabled the sides to avoid salary arbitration. Rodriguez, 25, is a five-time All-Star and has won five straight Gold Gloves.
<P><B></B>The Colorado Rockies and second baseman <B>Eric Young </B>have agreed to terms on a one-year contract.
<P><B></B><B>Sam Jethroe </B>and about two dozen other former Negro Leagues players will become eligible for pensions of $7,500 to $10,000 per season, owners decided last week. Jethroe, the 1950 National League Rookie of the Year, sued owners, claiming discrimination left him short of qualifying for baseball&#39;s pension plan. But the suit was dismissed by a U.S. District Judge.
<P>
<P><h3>Skiing</h3>
<P>
<P><B></B><B>Pernilla Wiberg </B>got closer to her proclaimed goal -- successfully defending her World Cup slalom title -- and even more at Zwiesel, Germany, with her fifth victory. In addition to leading the slalom standings, the 26-year-old Swede is on top in the race for the giant slalom and overall titles.
<P><B></B>Austrian <B>Thomas Sykora </B>improved on his near-perfect record at Wengen, Switzerland, by winning his fifth World Cup slalom race this season to move closer to a championship.
<P>
<P><h3>Gymnastics</h3>
<P>
<P>* Knoxville Gymnastics Training Center&#39;s boys placed second in the Houston (Texas) Invitational. Eighty-one teams, represented by 500 boys from Canada, Russia and 13 states, competed. Knoxville scored 134.05 points.

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Industrial grants are chided as welfare for the rich</B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> State program is too free with its funds, critics say</FONT><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Rebecca Ferrar, News-Sentinel Nashville bureau</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- One of Tennessee&#39;s key industrial recruiting tools is being called &#39;&#39;welfare for the rich&#39;&#39; and may need major revamping, critics say.
<P>   The Tennessee Industrial and Infrastructure Program is the target of a comptroller&#39;s study that&#39;s expected to be completed in several weeks. TIIP provides grants to local governments for roads, sewers, water lines and site preparation to entice industries to locate or expand in Tennessee.
<P>   While not recommending that the popular program be disbanded, some officials say it&#39;s being used without a strategic plan to promote economic development, that the grants are an entitlement available to almost anyone who applies and that there&#39;s little verification that businesses bring the jobs or wages promised.
<P>   Grants also are used for technical training.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s turned into welfare for the rich,&#39;&#39; said Secretary of State Riley Darnell, a Democrat. &#39;&#39;Just about anybody who applies seems to get one. It&#39;s not the ones that really need it.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Grants are made without &#39;&#39;discrimination&#39;&#39; rather than to specifically attract industry, he said.
<P>   While each of the state&#39;s three grand divisions received about the same amount of money during 1995 and 1996, the city of Knoxville received only one TIIP grant of $300,000 for infrastructure for G.M. Joint Venture. The Knox County government received none.
<P>   Gov. Don Sundquist&#39;s home county of Shelby received $5.7 million in similar grants during the same period, including two for $1 million that exceed the $750,000 cap -- a cap that apparently can be waived under some economic circumstances.
<P>   Hamilton County received $1.2 million, and Davidson County and Nashville received almost $900,000.
<P>   Mike McGuire, manager of the TIIP program, blamed the lack of largess in Knox County on the city&#39;s and county&#39;s failure to apply for grants. Knox County also received less funding than Shelby County during the administration of former Gov. Ned McWherter.
<P>   McGuire and others defend TIIP as one of the few tools Tennessee has to compete with states that offer much bigger financial incentives to industry.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I would disagree that it&#39;s corporate welfare,&#39;&#39; McGuire said. &#39;&#39;It is assistance to city or county governments to help that city or county meet the requirements of industry. We consider it an investment in the community. We consider it an investment in the people and their future.&#39;&#39;
<P>   TIIP was established under McWherter in 1988 with $55 million for grants to local governments for &#39;&#39;job creation and/or retention.&#39;&#39; From its inception until Sept. 1, 1996, TIIP&#39;s infrastructure grants totaled $64 million. In the same period, spending for training was nearly $55 million.
<P>  The program is limited to manufacturing or other businesses that export or import products into Tennessee.
<P>   From 1988-1993, TIIP grants under the Democratic administration of McWherter ranged from $1 million to $9 million. In 1994, McWherter&#39;s last year in office, TIIP grants mushroomed to more than $14 million.
<P>   During 1995 and 1996, under the Republican administration of Sundquist, the TIIP program has spent more than $13 million each year. When he took office, however, there were commitments made by McWherter that forced Sundquist to get an additional budget appropriation.
<P>   Economic and Community Development Commissioner William Dunavant originally recommended a $15 million TIIP budget for 1997-98 but now has scaled that back to $10 million because of this year&#39;s budget shortfall, said the department&#39;s spokeswoman, Leigh Wieland.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The TIIP program is instrumental in helping Tennessee to compete with other states and attract economic development to this state,&#39;&#39; said Beth Fortune, the governor&#39;s press secretary. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s one of our major economic development tools because, unlike other states, we don&#39;t give away the store.&#39;&#39;
<P>   She said Sundquist would consider any improvements recommended by the comptroller&#39;s office, which is headed by William Snodgrass, a Democrat.
<P>   Some criticism has been leveled against TIIP for the size of the grants and the industries benefitting from them. For example, some awards are less than $50,000, including one as low as $9,000 under Sundquist, while others range into the hundreds of thousands.
<P>   Also, many established companies, like Clayton Homes, Kroger Corp., Tyson Foods and Federal Express, are on the TIIP list.
<P>   
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s come to be an entitlement to any (company), such as Kroger,&#39;&#39; said Treasurer Steve Adams, a Democrat. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s hard to say no to existing businesses who are creating jobs, but more than likely those jobs would be created. My question is, should we turn down more grants?&#39;&#39;
<P>   Like Darnell, he questioned whether the grants are awarded with any economic strategy.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think the TIIP program is an excellent vehicle to recruit manufacturing jobs,&#39;&#39; Adams said. &#39;&#39;I think we have to carefully recruit.&#39;&#39;
<P>   McGuire conceded that it&#39;s &#39;&#39;mostly true&#39;&#39; that all applicants for grants are approved, but he explained that local governments now know the standards that must be met.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We used to get off-the wall requests,&#39;&#39; McGuire said. &#39;&#39;Over the years, we&#39;ve turned those down.&#39;&#39;
<P>   He said his department checks annually on job creation -- though not on wages -- through reports it asks industries to file.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Some of them have greatly exceeded employment projections; others have not reached employment projects,&#39;&#39; he said, noting that hiring and fulfilling contracts takes time.
<P>   Rep. Matt Kisber, D-Jackson, a TIIP backer, said Finance Commissioner John Ferguson has &#39;&#39;tried to get it under reign.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;Tennessee brings the least amount of financial resources to the table of every state with whom we compete,&#39;&#39; Kisber said. &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve got to make some small gesture to show we&#39;re serious.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Without some money for infrastructure and training, some businesses would not locate here, he said.
<P>   While Tennessee has a good labor force, a pro-business environment and a good location, &#39;&#39;all that doesn&#39;t matter if you can&#39;t get a sewer line to a factory or a rail spur,&#39;&#39; Kisber said. &#39;&#39;It assists in the expansion of our economic base in the communites and in creating additional jobs.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Although the comptroller&#39;s report isn&#39;t out, it is expected to include recommendations to improve the program.
<P>   Dave Goetz, lobbyist for the Tennessee Business Roundtable, said it&#39;s essential that Tennessee retain its &#39;&#39;modest&#39;&#39; program to compete with the &#39;&#39;aggressive nature of other programs.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;We have very small spending overall of state resources to attract other jobs,&#39;&#39; he said.

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Park group &#39;concerned&#39; about TVA power plan</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Jerry Dean and John Stiles, News-Sentinel staff writers</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">G</FONT>ATLINBURG -- Members of the  Great Smoky Mountains Park Commission have voiced a &#39;&#39;concern&#39;&#39; over TVA&#39;s plans for new transmission lines between Blount and Sevier counties.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I have concerns about it,&#39;&#39; said Dr. Don Robinson.
<P>   Commission Chairman Dean Stone said the proposed line would cross park property in two places.
<P>   The commission -- which met Friday in Gatlinburg -- is appointed by the state to serve as a liaison between Tennessee and the National Park Service.
<P>   Commissioner Darrell Akins said in &#39;&#39;no way&#39;&#39; did he want to be &#39;&#39;critical&#39;&#39; of TVA, but he would like for the commission to meet with TVA officials for details.
<P>   G. Dodd Galbreath of the Tennessee Environmental Policy Office, who was named excutive secretary of the commission, advised the group to wait until TVA completes an environmental assessment before it takes any action.
<P>   TVA officials said rapid commercial and residential expansion in Sevierville, Pigeon Forge and Blount County has led to the plan.
<P>   Allen Miller, project engineer of TVA&#39;s Transmission and Power Supply Group in Chattanooga, said Friday that TVA will conduct public hearings to solicit public comment on new corridors for upgraded powerlines.
<P>   The hearings will be held:
<P>   * Tuesday, Jan. 28, at Wearwood Elementary School in Wears Valley;
<P>   * Wednesday, Jan. 29, at Heritage High School in Maryville.
<P>   Miller said growth rates, especially in Sevier County, are sufficient that TVA must complete a new 161-kilovolt line to serve those communities by November 1999.
<P>   Otherwise, TVA predicts, electrical demand there will reach capacity by 2000. 
<P>   Since the 1990 federal census, Sevier County&#39;s population has risen about 16.7 percent to nearly 60,000, while Blount County&#39;s population has grown 12.8 percent to more than 97,000.
<P>   Sevier County now is served from Douglas Dam on the French Broad River, north of Sevierville.
<P>    To meet expansion needs, added power must be routed from TVA via its Alcoa switching center into Sevier County&#39;s electrical system.
<P>    Using that center allows TVA to route power from several sources to Sevier County customers. 
<P>   The proposed project also affects the Blockhouse substation near Maryville.
<P>    A wooden-pole transmission line east from Maryville toward Townsend must be rebuilt and a new right of way secured, Miller said, to &#39;&#39;bridge the gap&#39;&#39; in lines through very hilly terrain between Townsend and Pigeon Forge.

        in 1996</b></font><br>
<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Eleni Chamis, News-Sentinel
        business writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">M</font>cGhee Tyson Airport surpassed its
        goal of 1.4 million passengers for 1996, and is setting
        its sights even higher for 1997. </p>
        <p>For 1996, the number of airport passengers grew 4.65
        percent from 1995, from 1,346,537 to 1,409,100. The 1997
        goal is at least 1,450,000 passengers. </p>
        <p>''Over the last 10 years, we've averaged about 4
        percent growth,'' said Dave Conklin, the authority's
        marketing director. ''This is the best we've had in at
        least four to five years. Now it's accelerating. </p>
        <p>''What is enticing to think is what would happen if a
        low-fare carrier like Southwest were to come in?'' </p>
        <p>He added the airport will be more aggressive in trying
        to attract low-fare carriers to Knoxville. Currently,
        AirTran, offering service to Orlando, is the only one. </p>
        <p>To stay competitive when AirTran came on board in
        October 1994, Delta dropped select fares to Orlando,
        Conklin said. </p>
        <p>In 1996, eight of the 13 airlines that serve the
        airport had increases in passengers. </p>
        <p>For 1996, United Airlines increased passengers by more
        than 50 percent over 1995; Comair, the Delta connection,
        grew by 31 percent. </p>
        <p>''One thing that impacted growth for December was that
        Dec. 1-2 were the last traveling days of the Thanksgiving
        holiday, and the heaviest travel day of the year is the
        Sunday after Thanksgiving,'' Conklin said. ''But if you
        factor that out, we still would have grown by 8, 9
        percent (for the month).'' </p>
        <p>Just 28 years ago, in 1968, the airport served 680,000
        passengers. 1996 saw that mark more than double. </p>
        <p>''That's important because when airlines are looking
        at a city, they look at what the city is doing. Is it a
        growing market?'' said Conklin. </p>
        <p>He credits the year's success to several factors such
        as low unemployment and a strong economy. </p>
        <p>Also during 1996, two new airlines were added.
        Continental Express inaugurated service to Cleveland,
        Ohio; Lone Star launched to Dallas/Fort Worth; and
        Corporate Express began flights to Nashville. </p>
        <p>''I see that continuing throughout this year,'' he
        said. ''One of our goals is to add additional service,
        and I think we'll have more service from existing
        carriers.'' </p>
        <p>Conklin added the airport is in discussions with one
        carrier who is considering initiating nonstop jet
        service. The airport is also ''having conversations''
        with a low-fare carrier looking at providing service to
        several destinations. </p>
        <p>Another goal is increasing service from McGhee Tyson
        to more of the top 25 markets from Knoxville. Currently,
        the airport has nonstop service to 14 of them. </p>
        <p>''Something that will help us to do that is that
        airlines are purchasing 50-passenger jets,'' Conklin
        explained. ''They fly as high and as fast as the bigger
        jets. . . . That opens up markets where there may not be
        enough volume in passengers to support a 130-to-140-seat
        jet. </p>
        <p>''They're just now coming on line,'' he said, noting
        that several airlines are ordering them in bulk to
        prepare for what they see as a coming trend. ''Airlines
        are looking for places to economically use these
        aircraft. A city like Knoxville is just the right size.''
        </p>
        <p>For example, if an airline provided nonstop jet
        service from Knoxville to New York, an 800-mile route,
        and the 50-passenger aircraft had 30 people aboard, that
        would be a 60 percent load factor. </p>
        <p>''That's probably successful for that airline,'' he
        said. </p>
        <p>As Knoxville grows, Chattanooga and the Tri-Cities
        have declined in service. Chattanooga flies five airlines
        to five cities; Tri-Cities four airlines to four cities.
        Knoxville currently has 13 airlines which provide service
        to 14 cities. </p>
        <p>''It's where we want to be, because it definitely
        catches the attention of the airlines,'' said Conklin. </p>
        <p>The Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority is
        designing and building new concourses and renovating the
        terminal. </p>
        <p>''One of the things that necessitates a new terminal
        is the growth,'' Conklin said. ''One of the things that
        the airlines ask for when they're looking at this market
        is the exclusive use of a gate and ticket counter space.
        They want their own gate, their own logos, their own
        identity.'' </p>
        <p>Corporate Express took the last existing ticket
        counter when its service began in October. </p>
        <p>''We've grown to the point where we're saturated.
        We're having to subcontract on gate space. As an airport,
        that's a nice position to be in.'' Conklin said. </p>

</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Bob Hodge, News-Sentinel outdoors editor</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT>eer season in East Tennessee and across the state is destined to set another record.
<P>     With kill tags still being counted, deer hunters are expected to easily break the record statewide harvest of 145,132 set a year ago by about 5,000. In East Tennessee, the total number of tags received is 15,250, up from 14,279 in 1995.
<P>     The state&#39;s deer herd is estimated to be at more than 850,000 and growing. In 1975, the herd was estimated at fewer than 125,000 deer.
<P>     &#39;&#39;In East Tennessee, all the counties either went up or stayed the same with the exception of Hancock,&#39;&#39; said Bob Nichols, biologist for the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency in Region IV.
<P>     &#39;&#39;Archery was up, muzzleloader was up and the gun kill was up. The increase is about where we were wanting it to be.&#39;&#39;
<P>     The only real change in the deer season in 1996 was splitting the gun season into two separate seasons. Nichols said participation in the late gun season, and the number of deer bagged, were less than expected.
<P>     &#39;&#39;There are several reasons why fewer deer than expected were killed,&#39;&#39; Nichols said. &#39;&#39;One was the weather. The first weekend of the season it was about 12 degrees, then the next weekend it&#39;s 70. That had an impact.
<P>     &#39;&#39;Another reason was a lot of people were just hunting for a big buck. They had already killed enough deer for meat, and they were letting the spikes walk. And, really, I think a lot of people didn&#39;t hunt just because they were tired of hunting.&#39;&#39;
<P>     It&#39;s expected the December gun hunt will remain a part of the deer season in East Tennessee.
<P>     &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t see any reason to change it,&#39;&#39; Nichols said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s a good season. Most hunters I talked to liked it whether they killed a deer or not.&#39;&#39;
<P>     Still, East Tennessee continues to be about 10 years behind the western part of the state when it comes to deer hunting. While hunters statewide have about a 50-50 chance of killing a deer, East Tennessee hunters have about a 1-in-3 chance, and that includes deer they may kill in Middle or West Tennessee.
<P>     &#39;&#39;If you just hunt in East Tennessee, your chances of killing a deer are less than 33 percent,&#39;&#39; Nichols said. &#39;&#39;&#39;The growth of the deer herd is about where we want it to be, but we still have 10 years, and in some cases 15 or 20 years, to go in some counties.&#39;&#39;
<P>
<P>     <B>SPORTSMAN LICENSE: </B>Tennessee hunters and fishermen who want to purchase a Sportsman License can do so by phone. Hunters can call 1-888-222-TWRA (8972) to order the license with a Visa, MasterCard or Discover Card.
<P>     Information needed will be name, address, physical description, Social Security number, driver&#39;s license number, previous Sportsman License number (if it&#39;s a renewal) and the credit-card number.
<P>     Licenses should be received by March 1. After March 1, the licenses should be received within five days of the order.
<P>
<P>     <B>BEAR HUNTERS: </B>Bear hunters had the third-best hunting season on record in 1996.
<P>     Hunters killed 116 bears in &#39;96 with 26 of those being killed during the early season. That was just eight shy of the record of 124 in 1990.
<P>    During the early season, four bears were bagged in Blount County, seven in Cocke County and 15 in Sevier County. During the late season, 20 were killed in Cocke County, 11 in Greene, 29 in Monroe, 10 in Polk, seven in Sevier, 10 in Unicoi and three in Washington.
<P>     The 1997 seasons will be set at the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Commission meeting in late May or early June.

                dangerous times for drivers is as they let out
                one fare and someone tries to flag them down for
                a ride.</strong></font></td>

        <p><font size="5">K</font>noxville taxicab companies are
        limiting night fares, refusing to operate in certain
        parts of town and, in some cases, requiring advance
        payment in the wake of a recent rash of robberies,
        operators say. </p>
        <p>''It's just ridiculous,'' a frustrated U.G. Turner
        said. Turner owns Service &amp; Yellow Cab Co. on East
        Fifth Avenue. </p>
        <p>His drivers have been robbed three times in a month,
        but Turner said robberies have been an unfortunate cost
        of business for the 50 years he's been in operation. </p>
        <p>''If they start robbing, there's certain places we
        just don't send cabs,'' Turner said. </p>
        <p>When the recent rash of cab driver robberies started
        -- police say there have been at least a half dozen in a
        month -- Turner said he ordered Townview Terrace
        apartment complex off limits for his drivers. Four of the
        latest six robberies have occurred in the Townview
        parking lot, records show. </p>
        <p>Steve Holmes, manager of Quality Limo on North
        Broadway, said his company also has dropped Townview from
        its approved pick-up and drop-off list. One of his
        drivers was attacked during a recent robbery attempt
        there, Holmes said. </p>
        <p>The Townview apartment complex is partially funded by
        the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The
        sprawling complex has at least three different sets of
        apartments and a high-rise building. It is on Mulvaney
        Street, just one street from the Knoxville Police
        Department headquarters. </p>
        <p>''It's terrible that you can't send a car into these
        places,'' Holmes said. ''It's not the people who live
        there. It's the drug dealers who hang out there.'' </p>
        <p>Barbara Tyler, who manages the Townview complex for
        Wood Properties, said she shares the concerns of Holmes
        and Turner. She blamed the complex's location in a ''high
        crime area,'' noting the Austin Homes housing project, a
        hot spot for drugs and gang violence, is just across the
        street from the complex. </p>
        <p>''We have added lighting to almost every building,''
        she said. ''We screen applicants very thoroughly. I
        really feel like we're doing a lot over there to rid the
        area of crime.'' </p>
        <p>Tyler also noted a Knoxville police officer lives in
        the complex, although the officer does not work as a
        security guard at Townview. KPD also has targeted
        Townview with a bicycle patrol. </p>
        <p>A police presence does not seem to deter the taxicab
        robbers, however. A Double J. Cab Co. driver was robbed
        three weeks ago in the Townview parking lot while two
        officers were at the complex on an unrelated call. </p>
        <p>The robbers, who called for a cab to take them to a
        fast-food restaurant on Magnolia Avenue, chatted with the
        driver before brandishing a gun and stealing the driver's
        cash, fanny pack and pager. </p>
        <p>They dropped the loot, however, when they encountered
        the two police officers as they ran from the cab, a
        police report stated. </p>
        <p>Holmes and Turner said they are asking their drivers
        to exercise judgment before accepting a fare, to limit
        how much cash they keep on hand and to regularly
        communicate with their dispatchers and other drivers via
        portable radio systems. </p>
        <p>Turner said his company is ''turning down about half
        the calls at night because it's too dangerous.'' </p>
        <p>And Holmes said he has told his drivers ''to just run
        over (the robbers) if you have to.'' </p>
        <p>KPD Investigator J.L. Price said cab drivers are
        ''easy pickings'' because they can be lured to places
        ''out in the middle of nowhere. They are more out in the
        open, more on the bad guys' turf.'' </p>
        <p>Price, who said he has suspects in some of the cab
        robberies, advised cab drivers and operators to ''use
        good old common sense.'' </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Jerry Dean, News-Sentinel
        business writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>ennessee Valley residents cranked
        up their thermostats Friday morning and thus helped TVA
        set a system record for peak power demand exceeding
        26,500 megawatts. </p>
        <p>TVA engineers still were computing the exact figure,
        which would not be available until some time today. But
        the regional power producer already knew enough Friday to
        confirm the agency had surpassed its all-time power
        demand peak -- a 25,995-megawatt level notched Feb. 5,
        1996. </p>
        <p>TVA said the record, set about 9 a.m. EST, occurred
        when the average temperature systemwide was about 10
        degrees. </p>
        <p>Spokesman John Moulton said TVA had anticipated the
        rise in demand, even after a relatively balmy Wednesday
        dropped regional power needs to a relatively low 21,807
        megawatts. </p>
        <p>On Monday and Tuesday, when snow remained on the
        ground in Knoxville, TVA recorded demand ranging from
        25,500 to 25,600 megawatts. TVA's summer peak demand
        record remains 25,496 megawatts, reached July 13, 1995. </p>
        <p>The previous winter peak was reached when temperatures
        in Knoxville plummeted 8 degrees below zero, shattering a
        low-temperature record that had stood for 110 years. </p>
        <p>Spokeswoman Barbara Martocci said Friday marked the
        first time all five of TVA's nuclear power units and all
        its major fossil-fueled and hydropower plants were
        available to meet demand. </p>
        <p>TVA said the system met the demand with no need for
        service curtailments to major industrial customers. </p>
        <p>To conserve energy, Derwin Hagood, KUB customer
        service manager, urged residents to lower thermostats
        overnight to 55 or 60 degrees, keep heating units clean
        and serviced, replace furnace filters and limit use of
        kitchen and bath ventilators. Some heat may be conserved
        by reversing ceiling fans for downward air flow. </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By The Associated Press</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">P</font>HILADELPHIA -- Conrail
        shareholders set back a takeover bid by CSX Friday when a
        richer offer was dangled by rival Norfolk Southern. </p>
        <p>At stake is a merger that will create the nation's
        third-largest railroad and a stronghold over rail freight
        in the East, where Conrail's track is concentrated. </p>
        <p>CSX Corp., which already owns nearly 20 percent of the
        stock of Conrail Inc., failed to get the shareholder
        approval it needed to buy an additional 20 percent under
        Pennsylvania's antitakeover laws. CSX is offering $110 a
        share in cash for that installment and says it will buy
        the remaining 60 percent of Conrail for stock in a deal
        valued at nearly $9.7 billion, or about $105.57 a share. </p>
        <p>Norfolk Southern Corp., is offering $115 in cash for
        all Conrail stock, a $10.5 billion deal. It claimed to
        receive the support of at least 53 percent of the shares
        voted Friday. With the setback to CSX, Norfolk Southern
        said it would proceed with its plans to spend $1 billion
        to buy 9.9 percent of Conrail's stock. </p>
        <p>Norfolk Southern cannot buy a bigger share of Conrail
        without triggering ''poison-pill'' defenses that make a
        takeover prohibitively expensive. </p>
        <p>Norfolk Southern's chairman, David R. Goode, vowed a
        complete takeover. ''The issues are too important to
        stand aside when the future of transportation in the East
        is at stake,'' he said. </p>
        <p>Conrail and CSX pledged to make their deal work. In
        their favor is an agreement in which Conrail's board has
        promised not to consider any rival offers through 1999.
        ''Norfolk knew that our shareholders would support the
        CSX transaction and made this enticing offer solely to
        undermine this vote,'' said David M. LeVan, Conrail's
        chairman, said in conceding defeat. </p>
        <p>LeVan and John W. Snow, chairman of CSX, said the deal
        would not be restructured, but the companies will mount
        new campaigns to persuade stockholders of the merger's
        benefits. A new vote will be scheduled, perhaps within a
        month. </p>

        high-powered offense</b></font><br>
<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Nick Gates, News-Sentinel
        sportswriter</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>he two highest scoring teams in
        the East Coast Hockey League collided Friday night. South
        Carolina emptied both barrels into Knoxville and left the
        Cherokees for dead. </p>
        <p>Ed Courtenay had a hat trick and David Mayes two goals
        as South Carolina peppered Knoxville 9-2 at Civic
        Coliseum to move into first place in the Eastern
        Division. </p>
        <p>The Cherokees, who lost their fourth consecutive game,
        dropped to 13-23-2. Their wild-card playoff chances took
        another hit. But one wonders if that was damaged as badly
        as their psyche. They haven't beaten anybody but Raleigh
        since Thanksgiving. </p>
        <p>South Carolina's special teams were as impressive as
        the Stringrays' skating and passing. Coach Rick Vaive's
        team converted four of seven power plays and killed six
        of seven penalties. </p>
        <p>The game within a game saw Mike Ross, the Stingrays'
        top sniper, tally a goal and four assists to move ahead
        of Knoxville All-Star Jim Brown for the league's
        individual scoring championship. Ross has a league high
        35 goals and 64 points. Brown got his 24th goal for 61
        points. </p>
        <p>South Carolina (25-7-4) also got goals from defensemen
        Scott Boston and Steve Parsons and Kyle Ferguson. </p>
        <p>The Stringays, who bombarded the Cherokees 7-1 on
        Tuesday night at Charleston, came out firing. They
        outshot Knoxville 17-3 in the first period and built a
        3-0 lead. If it hadn't been for a couple of great saves
        by Cherokees goalie Brad Guzda, it would have been worse.
        </p>
        <p>Mayes scored his sixth goal to start the barrage.
        Power-play goals by Courtenay and Ross followed.
        Courtney's came with Brown (cross-checking) and Greg
        Bailey (unsportsmanlike conduct) in the penaly box. Ross
        notched his league-high 35th 25 seconds after Dean Moore
        was banished for slashing. </p>
        <p>South Carolina netminder Tara Lendzyk hardly broke a
        sweat. </p>
        <p>Whenever the Cherokees mustered a rush, South
        Carolina's defensemen put on a clinic. </p>
        <p>Chris Hynnes, who is a league-leading plus-31, used
        his stick and deflected the puck out of harm's way and.
        Boston, a former Kee, slid on his belly to take away the
        passing lane and foil 2-on-1 by Ole Kjenstad and Vaclav
        Nedomansky. </p>
        <p>Brown's seventh power-play goal 7:00 into the second
        period gave Knoxville hope. But it was quickly dashed. </p>
        <p>Courtenay, anchored on the doorstep of the crease,
        scooped up a rebound and put a backhander behind Guzda
        with Jamie Bird off for slashing. Boston deked a
        defenseman and flipped in his 10th 2:27 later to extend
        South Carolina's domination to 5-1. </p>
        <p>Moore got his fifth goal with 7:57 remaining but it
        only served to alienate the Stingrays. Parson, Mayes,
        Ferguson and Courtenay unleashed a blitzkreig that left
        the Cherokees embarrassed. </p>
        <p><b>STARS COME OUT:</b> The fifth annual ECHL All-Star
        Game on Tuesday night at Independence Arena in Charlotte
        will be shown on TV in more than 25 million homes
        throughout the U.S. </p>
        <p>The opening faceoff is 7:35. Brown will be Knoxville's
        representative on the team, which will play the
        defending-champion Charlotte Checkers. </p>
        <p>Satellite-dish viewers will be able to see the game
        live on Prime Network affiliates, SportsChannel Ohio and
        SportsChannel Cincinnati. </p>
        <p><b>KEES NOTEBOOK:</b> Injured defensemen Dan Chaput
        (ankle) and Sean Halifax (wrist) did not play. . . .
        Forward Stephane Soulliere is on personal leave. </p>

        <p><font size="5">O</font>AK RIDGE -- When 11-year-old
        Paul Fuller's pet Labrador retriever fell through the ice
        on Melton Hill Lake, Paul went out to save him. </p>
        <p>But when Paul broke through the ice Wednesday evening
        and became mired in lake bottom mud, trapped neck-deep in
        the lake, it was his dog who returned the favor,
        authorities said. </p>
        <p>''Paul was about worn out, but the dog was raising
        Cain,'' said Oak Ridge Assistant Fire Chief Tom Hill. He
        said the barking alerted a neighbor, who saw the boy's
        plight and called E-911 as Paul's brother ran for help. </p>
        <p>With a rescue line tied around him, firefighter Bob
        Logan crawled out to the boy, who was stuck some 40 to 50
        feet from shore. Hill said the ice gave way as Logan
        reached the boy, ''and he just sunk down into the lake.''
        </p>
        <p>Hill said Logan started bringing Paul toward shore. </p>
        <p>''He (Logan) was getting worn out, too, because every
        few inches, he had to push the ice away while he was
        dragging the boy.'' </p>
        <p>Hill said firefighter Richard Cox helped in the
        rescue, while firefighter Gary Terry used a canoe to
        retrieve the retriever. </p>
        <p>Paul was treated and released at Methodist Medical
        Center of Oak Ridge for mild hypothermia. </p>
        <p>Paul and his brother, Chris, 13, had been with Bailey
        when the 7-month-old puppy went onto the frozen lake to
        fetch an errant ball, said the boys' mother, Sherry
        Fuller. </p>
        <p>After both boy and dog took their dunking, ''Paul said
        he couldn't get out,'' Fuller said. ''Every time he tried
        to climb, the ice would break.'' </p>
        <p>She said Chris unsuccessfully tried to reach his
        brother with a stick. ''Thank goodness he didn't go out
        there,'' she said. ''He did the right thing.'' She said
        Chris then found a piece of plastic foam to buoy his
        brother before running off to seek help. </p>
        <p>Fuller said the embayment is about a quarter-mile from
        their home on Bridgewater Lane. ''They love the woods and
        water,'' she said of her two sons. ''It never occurred to
        me that it was frozen back there and they would get on
        it.'' </p>

        <p><font size="5">W</font>hite House correspondent
        Deborah Mathis said Thursday that society is afraid ''not
        just for its children but of its children.'' </p>
        <p>Mathis, a nationally syndicated columnist through
        Tribune Media in Chicago, was the keynote speaker at the
        annual Labor, Business, Industry and Government Awards
        Luncheon commemorating the life of Dr. Martin Luther King
        Jr. More than 300 people, many of them leaders in the

        </table>''This is the first time in the history of human kind
        that a society has been afraid not just for its children
        but of its children,'' Mathis said. </p>
        <p>''My parents were afraid of us getting hit by a car,
        of us drowning in the pond, and every now and then, about
        some stranger coming by and whisking us away to hell,''
        Mathis continued. ''They always worried for us, but they
        never were afraid of us. Until now.'' </p>
        <p>''If this is not a crisis, then I don't know what
        is.'' </p>
        <p>Mathis' speech -- powerful, passionate and evidence
        that her father was a preacher -- talked about an array
        of topics including the world at large. She urged the
        crowd to stop looking for a national interest in foreign
        affairs and instead take a ''human interest'' in what
        happens in such places as Rwanda, Northern Ireland and
        the Middle East. </p>
        <p>''There should not have to be a direct link to you
        pocketbook or your neighborhood for you to feel your
        interests are at stake,'' she said. </p>
        <p>Before taking on international problems, Mathis told
        the crowd to first work on saving the nation. And before
        saving the nation, people need to work on fixing their
        communities, she said. But before tackling the ills of
        the community, Mathis told the crowd they must first fix
        their homes and themselves. </p>
        <p>''Home needs to be right before we can go out and
        tackle the problems of the world,'' she said. ''We need
        to be home solid, so when we get out there as pillars of
        the community we really are made of something.'' </p>
        <p>She encouraged husbands to be faithful, saying it
        takes a ''strong man to stay with one women.'' </p>
        <p>''You stick with one women for 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50
        years and you are something honey,'' Mathis said. </p>
        <p>She then turned the tables on the women, asking them,
        ''Are you tearing him down or building him up.'' </p>
        <p>''This man you marry is supposed to be the manhood for
        each one of us,'' Mathis said. </p>
        <p>Mathis' column appears in more than 100 newspapers and
        periodicals, including The News-Sentinel. </p>
        <p>Gaiterson Construction Inc., Knoxville Building and
        Construction Trade Carpenters Local Union No. 50,
        Goodwill Industries Inc. and the city of Knoxville's
        Parks and Recreation Department received awards for
        service and efforts to improve the lives of Knoxvillians.

                <p><font size="5">C</font>ontract negotiations with the
        union representing workers at Philips Consumer
        Electronics Co.'s Plant 3 in Greeneville will begin again
        next week, the potential new owners of the plant said
        Thursday. </p>
        <p>GC Capital principals George Taylor and Charles White
        said negotiations will probably begin Tuesday, and they
        hope for another union vote in early February. If the
        contract is approved then, it could still take an
        additional two weeks to a month to close the sale. </p>
        <p>Members of the International Union of Electronic,
        Electrical, Salaried, Machine &amp; Furniture Workers
        AFL-CIO Local 796 turned down a previous contract offer
        in December, protesting cuts in benefits. </p>
        <p>Since then, Taylor and White have been seeking ways to
        come to an agreement with the union without sacrificing
        competitiveness. </p>
        <p>They hope to model the Greeneville purchase after
        their purchase of the Philips wood cabinet plant in
        Jefferson City. As JC Cabinet Co., they still do work for
        Philips, but they added other manufacturing contracts,
        leased warehouse space to Rubbermaid and continue to
        lease office space for the Philips customer-service
        branch. </p>
        <p>JC Cabinet has increased its employment by about 75
        people in 11/2 years, and leasing the warehouse added 60
        Rubbermaid employees. The company has given three
        employee bonuses, each roughly equivalent to a week's
        wages, since they took over, the men said. </p>
        <p>Taylor and White said the pay scale at Greeneville
        will stay the same, but GC Capital can't offer the same
        benefits Philips did or they would be out of business in
        18 months. </p>
        <p>Benefits are a big expense at Greeneville because the
        average age of the Plant 3 work force is 52, they said. </p>
        <p>Taylor said he was asked if he discriminated against
        age. </p>
        <p>''(I said) yes, we discriminate against age. If they
        were all 20 years old, we wouldn't buy the place,''
        Taylor said. ''We like the older employee. The only
        negative is their health claims go up.'' </p>
        <p>Taylor said he had spent the past couple of weeks
        going back to insurance companies to see what could be
        done about alleviating the increased premium costs to the
        employees without giving up coverage. </p>
        <p>GC Capital has asked employees to carry more than
        twice as much in insurance costs than the employees paid
        under Philips. </p>
        <p>It has also asked them to accept reduced vacation
        benefits and substitute a 401(k) retirement savings plan
        with no guaranteed match for a defined benefit plan. </p>
        <p>GC Capital would offer one week of vacation after 6
        months and 2 weeks after 18 months -- an offer they
        believe is standard or better for new employees. </p>
        <p>At present, a single employee contributes $4 per week
        toward the cost of health insurance; the contribution
        would increase to $10 under the new plan. </p>
        <p>Employee-plus-one coverage would go up from $8 to $20
        per week, and family coverage would rise from $12 to $30
        weekly. </p>
        <p>Philips plant workers earn an average of $8.55 per
        hour. </p>
        <p>About 1,050 hourly employees and 300 salaried workers
        are employed at Plant 3 in Greeneville. The number is
        several hundred higher at peak production seasons. </p>
        <p>Taylor and White hope to reduce some of the
        seasonality and provide more steady employment at
        Greeneville by seeking additional contracts and making
        better use of plant capacity. </p>

        <font size="5">T</font>he team has won only two of its
        last 18 games, the defense has been as leaky as a sieve,
        and as of late the defensemen are spending nearly as much
        time with the team doctor as they do with the coach. </p>
        <p>To make matters worse, a star player, who got into an
        ugly shouting match with the coach, was suspended after
        being traded and failing to report, and ownership and
        coliseum management are at odds over a new lease that
        would keep the team from moving. </p>
        <p>Is there any doubt the Knoxville Cherokees have hit
        rock bottom? </p>
        <p>The answer is no. </p>
        <p>Coach Barry Smith, who is in the final year of a
        three-year contract, and players have not written off the
        1996-97 East Coast Hockey League season. While they admit
        an Eastern Division championship is out of the question,
        all are confident they can use the second half of the
        season to make the playoffs as a wild card. </p>
        <p>Playing for next season isn't an option at this point.
        </p>
        <p>''Heck, no,'' Smith said emphatically after a light
        practice Thursday. ''We've got half a season to go. The
        (regular-season) championship is out of sight, but we can
        make the playoffs.'' </p>
        <p>Smith's 1995-96 team did its Lazarus imitation a year
        ago. Those Cherokees won 18 of 21 games to pull
        themselves out of the hole. </p>
        <p>Time is on Knoxville's side. The Cherokees (13-22-2)
        are eight points behind Pensacola (17-18-2) in the
        wild-card race with 33 games to go. But they can't wait
        much longer to develop a winning attitude. </p>
        <p>''We've got to put something together and get on a
        good roll,'' Smith said. </p>
        <p>There's nothing wrong with Knoxville's offense. Only
        South Carolina is averaging more goals per game. Smith's
        job is to tweak a battered defense. He took a step in
        that direction this week by signing Greg Bailey, who adds
        size (6-foot-5, 228 pounds) and strength. </p>
        <p>Defenseman Mike Vandeberghe (wrist) skated Thursday
        and could be back in the lineup for tonight's game
        against South Carolina at 7:30 at Civic Coliseum. Dean
        Moore, who was used on defense along with forward Wayne
        Anchikoski because of manpower problems Wednesday, had 12
        stitches put in the side of his face after being struck
        by a puck. Moore is expected to return. </p>
        <p>But it might take more time to heal defensemen Sean
        Halifax (wrist) and Dan Chaput (ankle). </p>
        <p>It shouldn't take nearly as long to shore up the
        defensive mistakes and breakdowns that have haunted the
        Cherokees from opening day. But for some inexplicable
        reason, the giveaways continue to pile up. </p>
        <p>''We get to running around trying to correct a problem
        and we only add to it,'' said Smith, who has preached
        dumping or icing the puck at the first sign of trouble. </p>
        <p>Anchikoski, who returned Tuesday after being out about
        a month because of a concussion, was frustrated by
        Wednesday's 7-4 loss to Richmond, but also encouraged. </p>
        <p>''They (Richmond) are definitely a good team and we
        played well,'' Knoxville's captain said. ''We stuck with
        our game plan and things were working for us. We were
        down a goal heading into the third period.'' </p>
        <p>Breaks haven't been going Knoxville's way,
        particularly on the road where the Cherokees have the
        league's worst record (1-11-0). The gremlins also have
        followed Knoxville home. </p>
        <p>Vaclav Nedomansky had goals disallowed in three
        consecutive games. Video replays confirmed one, while
        another came a split second after the referee's whistle. </p>
        <p>Marginal penalty calls have toasted the Kees. Stephane
        Soulliere went to the box late in the third period,
        allowing Charlotte to score a power-play goal to tie the
        game. The Checkers won in a shootout. </p>
        <p>''I'm proud of the guys,'' Anchikoski said. ''We got
        in at 5 a.m. (Wednesday after a 7-1 loss at South
        Carolina). It was a long bus trip. If we keep coming to
        work every day, things will start turning round. But
        we'll never quit.'' </p>

        Bohstedt opened the door to her critical thinking class
        at the University of Tennessee on Wednesday, she got a
        shock. </p>
        <p>''I had to let in 51 students,'' said Bohstedt, who
        heads UT's department of philosophy. ''I told the
        students I'm sorry. If they're willing to sit together in
        a cramped, hot room for a semester, then I'm with them.''
        </p>
        <p>No one left, Bohstedt said. She thinks it's because
        possible budget cuts at the university are forcing
        department heads to expand class sizes and cut course
        offerings this spring semester. </p>
        <p>And she's not the only one who's noticed. </p>
        <p>''It's easy to look around and see what's happening,''
        said Dr. Lorayne Lester, dean of the College of Arts and
        Sciences. ''Larger classes, cut travel budgets,
        introducing materials fees . . . moving people around,
        canceling small classes to accommodate larger enrollments
        in more popular courses. We're collapsing sections
        together. </p>
        <p>''We're doing everything we can think of to
        accommodate the increasing numbers of students who want
        to go to UT.'' </p>
        <p>Students wonder if it's enough. </p>
        <p>''It seems like nothing I try to sign up for is
        open,'' said Benji Clemmer, a freshman who's still
        struggling with his schedule. </p>
        <p>''Or if you do, the sections are so much bigger, it's
        hard to fit everyone,'' said his friend, Cheryl Gohr,
        another freshman. </p>
        <p>Though she never wanted students to feel the impact of
        cuts, Lester said it was only a matter of time. </p>
        <p>''We are having to make adjustments that have to
        affect students,'' she said. ''There's no longer any
        flexibility in department budgets in our college, and I'm
        sure it's true elsewhere.'' </p>
        <p>At the start of the 1996-97 academic year, UT
        Chancellor Bill Snyder asked deans across the campus to
        set aside 3 percent of their budgets in the event that
        state revenues run short this year. The 3 percent isn't a
        precise figure, but Snyder has said he hopes it will
        cover the worst possible scenario. </p>
        <p>Though state officials haven't given the final word
        yet, UT officials warned their people not to touch the
        dollars, in case they have to turn funds over to the
        state. </p>
        <p>State officials have also warned UT to prepare for
        decreased funding in the 1997-98 academic year. Lester
        has told her departments to set up sample budgets for a
        variety of cuts. </p>
        <p>Dr. John Peters, UT vice chancellor for academic
        affairs, said many administrative offices are preparing
        for huge cuts, as well. But he said he doesn't believe
        they will affect the quality of a UT education. </p>
        <p>''We want to make a decision that won't hurt
        students,'' he said. ''I sincerely believe our quality
        hasn't been affected.'' </p>
        <p>Peters said this semester some departments are getting
        extra funding to add sections to accommodate student
        requests, especially with basic freshman courses or those
        students need to graduate. </p>
        <p>But John Conway, head of the department of
        mathematics, said it won't be long before quality is an
        issue. About 98 percent of his budget goes to personnel,
        and he's cut everything else that he could. </p>
        <p>The department isn't buying any new supplies this
        semester, including things like paper and pencils. Math
        professors invited to prestigious conferences are being
        told to pay their own way. Hours at the math tutoring
        center have been slashed. And he said that's only in
        preparation for the anticipated 3 percent impoundment
        from this year's budget. </p>
        <p>''At a certain point, you're talking about cutting
        people, and that hurts students,'' he said. ''I hope,
        when they realize how this will affect academic
        departments and students, they'll look elsewhere for
        their cuts.'' </p>

        1998 return to Pigeon Forge</b></font><br>
<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Eleni Chamis, News-Sentinel
        business writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>.G. Sheppard will take his show to
        Branson, Mo., this year and is in negotiations to return
        to Sevier County in 1998 with a new $8 million to $10
        million music theater. </p>
        <p>Sheppard said Wednesday he has looked at several sites
        in Pigeon Forge but has not pinpointed one on which to
        build a new T.G. Sheppard's Theater in the Smokies. He
        plans to open in the spring or summer of 1998. </p>
        <p>In August 1996, Sheppard said he would perform at
        Eagle Mountain Theater for the 1997 season with Con
        Hunley, an artist he called ''a good friend and great
        entertainer.'' </p>
        <p>He said the Eagle Mountain location had more
        visibility and better parking for vehicles and buses than
        his original location, T.G. Sheppard's Theater in the
        Smokies, on Showplace Boulevard in Pigeon Forge. </p>
        <p>It was supposed to undergo more than $500,000 in
        renovations, primarily an upgrade of sound and lighting
        equipment. </p>
        <p>''After checking the cost of making changes to
        building the stage to accommodate the quality of show
        I've been doing, it wasn't cost effective to make our
        show work in that theater,'' Sheppard said. ''We all
        agreed amicably for me not to make that move over there.
        It would take too long and be too costly.'' </p>
        <p>Sheppard stressed that neither he nor his employees
        would move to Branson. </p>
        <p>''I am keeping my home in Kodak,'' he said. ''I felt
        it was important to continue myself in a theater. . . . I
        felt it was important to go to a market so I could
        continue to build my bus and group sales business.
        Branson gave me that opportunity to go and perform before
        bus tour companies that are already coming here now or
        will come in the future. </p>
        <p>''The only reason for this move is there is not any
        present location for us to go into here without
        building.'' </p>
        <p>In Branson, Sheppard will be performing at the
        Remington Theater, formerly the Wayne Newton Theatre.
        Sheppard is familiar with Branson, having performed there
        for 12 years. </p>
        <p>He also will do road dates in Las Vegas, Reno, and
        Lake Tahoe, Nev. </p>
        <p>The original T.G. Sheppard's Theater in the Smokies
        opened in 1995 at a cost of $12 million. Sheppard's lease
        on the 1,500-seat theater expired last month. </p>
        <p>Country Tonite, a country music/family variety show,
        will perform at that location, to be renamed Country
        Tonite Theatre. </p>

        <font size="5"><br>
        3 days sought on local items</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Patricia Lamiell, Associated
        Press business writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">N</font>EW YORK -- Buried in a torrent of
        requests before the new Congress is one from the Federal
        Reserve that would give banks an extra day to clear local
        checks. </p>
        <p>Critics charge the measure, if approved, could cost
        consumers millions of dollars in bounced-check fees. </p>
        <p>The issue hits a hot button with consumer groups,
        which believe checks deposited in consumers' bank
        accounts should quickly be made available to them. </p>
        <p>The Fed, the central bank, has asked Congress to amend
        1987 legislation that requires banks to make funds from
        deposited local checks available within two business
        days. </p>
        <p>Banks often guard against check fraud by not releasing
        the money until a check has cleared, which, thanks to
        modern technology, can happen quickly, sometimes the same
        day. </p>
        <p>''A check can be cleared and credited with almost the
        snap of a finger,'' said Mark Green, the Public Advocate
        for the City of New York. ''If anything, the Federal
        Reserve should be looking at ways to give people faster
        access to their own money -- not devising ways to force
        customers to subsidize banks.'' </p>
        <p>But because the Fed's clearing system is based largely
        on moving pieces of paper between banks, the Fed says
        banks need three days to make sure a check is good. A
        1995 Fed survey found that even though banks must make
        the money available within two days, less than half of
        locally generated, fraudulent checks are returned to the
        check writer's bank within that time. That means banks
        end up paying out money they can't recover. </p>
        <p>In a report to congressional banking committees last
        October, the Fed said extending the holding period
        ''would improve banks' ability to manage their risk.'' </p>
        <p>Congress's five-day clearing deadline for out-of-town
        checks is not as big a concern, the Fed said, since more
        than 80 percent of non-local checks are returned within
        the deadline. </p>
        <p>Some consumer advocates and banking experts contend
        revising the local-check rule would do little to
        intercept bad checks. Most check fraud is due to
        forgeries of signatures, which are not caught by the
        clearing system. Instead, the consumer advocates said, it
        would inconvenience consumers, who, unaware of the
        change, might bounce more checks. </p>
        <p>The rule change would put the onus of fraud protection
        on consumers, who can least afford to wait an extra day
        for their money, said Green and two other New York
        City-area Democrats, U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney and state
        Sen. Franz Leichter, in a letter to House Banking
        Committee Chairman Jim Leach, R-Iowa. </p>
        <p>Another issue is how much extra money financial
        institutions can earn by holding on to deposited funds
        for another day and investing them at the overnight bank
        rate, currently just over 5 percent. </p>
        <p>Martin Mayer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution,
        estimates that U.S. financial institutions would make
        $250 million to $300 million a day by keeping the funds
        another day. Fed officials could not confirm or dispute
        the figure. </p>

        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>he four Russians were practicing
        their specialty Wednesday at Knoxville Gymnastics
        Training Center. </p>
        <p>To the untrained eye, what they were doing looked like
        a cross between (1) cheerleaders flipping across the
        floor during a timeout at a basketball game and (2)
        Shannon Miller bounding and twisting across the mat
        during a floor exercise. </p>
        <p>But this was not gymnastics, insisted Michail
        Ovchinnikov, director of the Moscow Sports School. </p>
        <p>Tumbling is the correct American term, he said. In
        Russia, the activity is called ''sports acrobatics.'' </p>
        <p>The group from Moscow arrived in Knoxville on
        Wednesday and received a key to the city during a visit
        to the mayor's office. Their goal is to promote and
        educate Americans about an obscure sport that isn't
        included in the Olympics. </p>
        <p>Tatiana Paniyvan, 21, is a two-time world champion in
        acrobatics. Levon Petrosyan, Irina Garina and Victoria
        Danilkina also are among the elite in their sport. </p>
        <p>They are visiting Knoxville Gymnastics Center because
        it is recognized as one of the top training centers for
        power tumbling. Will Foster, a gymnastics coach in
        Florence, Ala., recommended the Russians include
        Knoxville on their itinerary. Coach Raisa Belivova is
        accompanying the team. </p>
        <p>''What we've noticed is how fanatic Americans are
        about gymnastics and how much enthusiasm they have,''
        Ovchinnikov said through an interpreter. </p>
        <p>''The Americans, they are burning with desire. I have
        noticed that many more girls than boys are at the
        centers.'' </p>
        <p>In Moscow, Ovchinnikov oversees a sports program in
        which 3,000 youngsters participate each year. That
        includes acrobatics, boxing and swimming. </p>
        <p>''We would like to see acrobatics move into the
        Olympics,'' Ovchinnikov said. </p>
        <p>''That's one reason we are traveling, to promote the
        sport. There are 7 to 9 judges who score an event in
        acrobatics. Of course, like in ice skating and
        gymnastics, each judge is subjective in scoring.'' </p>
        <p>The group will leave Knoxville on Saturday. </p>

        <font size="5">D</font>escribing a secret ballot on
        Election Commission vacancies as a ''horrible
        disservice'' to voters, state Sen. Bud Gilbert said
        Tuesday he will seek a state attorney general's opinion
        on whether the vote was legal. </p>
        <p>The Knoxville Republican said if the opinion concludes
        Saturday's vote by the Knox County GOP legislative
        delegation was illegal, he will consider steps to have it
        overturned. </p>
        <p>Regardless of the legal question, Gilbert said the
        secret ballot in selecting two recommendations for the
        Knox County Election Commission was ''inappropriate for
        public trust.'' </p>
        <p>Also Tuesday, the state Election Commission appointed
        lawyers Mike McClamroch and Steve Roth to the Knox County
        Election Commission. They replace fellow Republicans
        Hazel Showalter, who died last month, and Courtney
        Pearre, who resigned this week to become legal counsel to
        Gov. Don Sundquist. </p>
        <p>The two were selected Saturday by the county GOP
        caucus from a slate of 16 candidates and were elected on
        the second secret ballot. The first ballot by the seven
        members of the caucus narrowed the list to four, which
        also included West High School Principal Donna Wright and
        Halls businessman John Tindell. </p>
        <p>Among others, the East Tennessee Women's Political
        Caucus is protesting the vote for not only being secret,
        but also for not appointing a woman to the now all-male,
        five-member commission. </p>
        <p>''The Republican delegation's actions to ignore
        representation of women, and to avoid individual
        accountability by use of secret ballots, are
        unacceptable,'' the caucus said in a press release. </p>
        <p>Gilbert, who on both ballots voted for Wright and
        Roth, said whether the secret ballots violated the
        state's open meetings law is difficult to tell. </p>
        <p>There's no doubt governmental bodies that make
        recommendations to public bodies are covered by the law,
        Gilbert said. </p>
        <p>But where it gets murky is whether it deals with
        legislative delegations. He said the law does not really
        address that question. </p>
        <p>Also, he said the caucus' vote was just a
        recommendation. The state Election Commission is the body
        that actually makes the appointment. </p>
        <p>''Still, the bottom line is the vote was
        inappropriate,'' especially on the heels of last
        November's foul-up on early unification votes, Gilbert
        said. With the public's confidence already shaken,
        Saturday's vote does nothing to shore up that confidence,
        he said. </p>
        <p>On Tuesday, five Republican members of the Knox
        delegation were willing to disclose how they voted at
        Saturday's meeting when questioned by reporters in
        Nashville, but Sen. Ben Atchley and Rep. H.E. Bittle
        declined. </p>
        <p>''The people voted me into office on a secret ballot,
        too,'' Atchley said. </p>
        <p>Bittle said that, in the past, Knox legislators
        typically have never even held a meeting to vote on
        election commissioner appointments and instead made
        choices on an informal basis after talking with one
        another. </p>
        <p>''That vote is over now, and I don't think there's any
        reason to stir it up again,'' Bittle said. </p>
        <p>By several accounts, Roth got five votes and
        McClamroch four in the final tally, with Wright the
        runner-up with three votes. Each of the seven GOP
        legislators got to vote for two candidates. </p>
        <p>In an unrelated development at a meeting Tuesday in
        Nashville, the Knoxville area legislators unanimously
        elected Republican state Rep. Tim Burchett as chairman of
        the Knox County delegation, succeeding Jim Boyer,
        R-Corryton, who presided over Saturday's meeting on
        filling the Election Commission vacancies. </p>
        <p>Boyer said that ''my sense of the consensus'' among
        his Republican colleagues was for a secret ballot on
        Saturday, and he therefore decided that the vote should
        be secret in accord with the majority wishes. </p>
        <p>Boyer said he cast his own two votes for Tindell and
        Rebecca Longmire. </p>
        <p>Burchett said he voted for Wright and Roth. </p>
        <p>State Rep. Bill Dunn said he voted for McClamroch and
        Wright. </p>
        <p>Sen. Randy McNally of Oak Ridge, whose district
        includes part of Knox County, said he voted for Tindell
        and Roth on the final ballot. </p>
        <p>The election of Burchett as the new delegation
        chairman came after some jockeying between Boyer and
        Bittle, who at different points had both indicated an
        interest in being chairman. </p>
        <p>Bittle announced at the outset of Tuesday's meeting
        that he would step aside to ''make this as clean as I
        possibly can.'' Boyer then said that he once told members
        he planned to bow out in favor of Bittle. </p>
        <p>In an interview, Boyer said that, on reflection, he
        felt the chairmanship title ''probably needs to be spread
        around'' or rotated among different legislators. </p>
        <p>The upshot was Burchett's election by acclamation
        after nomination by Gilbert. Rep. Harry Tindell, a
        Democrat, was chosen vice chairman, also by acclamation.
        Burchett said afterward he foresees ''smooth sailing''
        for the delegation in the current session. ''I enjoy
        working with every one of these guys.'' </p>

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>A wild, wild week</B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Boar kills down, park reports</FONT><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Marti Davis, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT>IGEON FORGE -- Wildlife managers killed or captured 271 wild hogs in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park during 1996 -- the lowest tally in several years.
<P>    That may actually signal good news for the Smokies, says Bill Stiver, park wildlife specialist.
<P>    Stiver, who spoke at Wilderness Week in Pigeon Forge on Tuesday, said the number of wild hogs being captured or killed has declined for several years, indicating the park may finally be getting a handle on the hog population.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I think we&#39;ve got the (wild boar) population down as low as we&#39;re going to get it,&#39;&#39; Stiver said.
<P>    The park&#39;s wildlife management staff won&#39;t slow its efforts to minimize the wild boar population now, Stiver said.
<P>    January through April are prime months for the seven park employees who are trained and licensed to hunt and trap wild boar inside park boundaries, he said.
<P>    Hunting has been far more effective than trapping. Last year the park caught just 38 wild boar, he said. Some of the mature boar trapped are transported to legal hunting areas in the Cherokee National Forest or Nantahala National Forest. The rest are killed and some of the frozen shoats are fed to the endangered red wolves that are being held for release into the park.
<P>    Wild hogs, which are not native to North America, came to the region in 1912 when a consortium of wild game hunters imported them from Europe. The hogs were let loose on a game preserve in North Carolina, just 15 miles southwest of the park boundary in what is now the Nantahala National Forest. They reached the park by the late 1940s and began to proliferate, breeding with domestic pig stock during their movement toward the park.
<P>    The hogs have been one of the most destructive animals in the park. Their rooting and wallowing tears up acres of precious plant material. A few areas that contained especially rare plant species have been fenced to keep out the hogs.
<P>    The hogs continue to compete with bears and other native mammals. They are voracious in their appetite for acorns and beech nuts, competing with the native black bear for this fat and protein rich food source in the fall, Stiver said.
<P>    The park began serious efforts to eradicate wild hogs or drastically reduce their numbers in 1977. Since that time the park has captured or killed some 3,500 wild boar.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve had some help,&#39;&#39; said Stiver, commenting that coyote migrated to the Smokies about 10 years ago and began killing off a substantial number. About 90 percent of the coyote droppings examined by park wildlife specialists contain wild boar hair, he said.
<P>    The wild boar sows have begun dropping litters in the past weeks and will continue through the next several weeks, Stiver said. Snowstorms like the one last week will help reduce the size of litters, also.

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>B.A.S.S. drops Daytona from list</B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> 3 of 4 possible sites located in Sevier</FONT><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Eleni Chamis, News-Sentinel business writer</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> 600-acre site in Daytona Beach, Fla., has been dropped from consideration for the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society&#39;s corporate headquarters and family resort.
<P>   That leaves just Sevier County and Birmingham, Ala., in the running for the $50 million, 150 to 250-job entertainment and educational development, called B.A.S.S. Outdoor America. The organization is currently headquartered in Montgomery, Ala.
<P>   The pair have survived cuts from the initial 80 cities that began this search a year and a half ago. Sevier and Knox counties -- which began with a total of six sites in the running -- now have three, all in Sevier County. Birmingham has one.
<P>   &#39;&#39;You win a few; you lose a few,&#39;&#39; said Drew Page, president of the Volusia County Business Development Corporation in Daytona Beach. &#39;&#39;If you don&#39;t play the game, you don&#39;t win or lose.&#39;&#39;
<P>   A letter dated Dec. 20, 1996, from B.A.S.S. notifying Page of the decision states that &#39;&#39;our selection process dictates that we narrow our choices. Our decisions have become very difficult.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The letter from Diehl Unger, president of B.A.S.S. Outdoor America, also states, &#39;&#39;Although we are impressed with and appreciative of the thought and creativity that has gone into your proposal and presentation, we are compelled to inform you that we are removing Volusia County from further consideration.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Unger and B.A.S.S. spokeswoman Ann Lewis could not be reached for comment. Inquiring about why Daytona Beach was eliminated brought stunned silence from two other B.A.S.S. employees.
<P>   &#39;&#39;If they have dropped Daytona Beach, I&#39;m not aware of it,&#39;&#39; said Shari McLendon, an administration assistant in the public relations department. &#39;&#39;I have not heard a thing about this. . . . That&#39;s not unusual though. With the key people being gone, the administrative assistant would not hear of any changes.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Daytona Beach had offered a $32.4 million incentives package, crowed about its year-round warmth, and boasted its huge number of pass-through tourists, especially on their way to Orlando, just an hour away.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We were basically told that Sevier County had better tourism numbers than we did and Birmingham&#39;s financial package was better than we were offering,&#39;&#39; said Page.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Early on, we had pretty well maxed out all of the incentives we could muster, and then we tried to pull the project over the top with community involvement and a united effort to attract the company. Unfortunately, we weren&#39;t successful,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   Page said he received the letter Jan. 2, but did not make it public until Tuesday after meeting with the corporation&#39;s leadership to discuss whether there was anything further that could be done.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We wanted to have one final review of the project to see if there was anything we had forgotten,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Frankly, we could not think of anything.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Then we felt like we owed it to all the people in the community to make it public.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Sevier&#39;s three sites still under consideration are:
<P>   * 85 acres, with option on 200 to 300 more. Site would be in River Bluff Landing, which already includes the Lee Greenwood Theater, and Wingate Inn. A fine dining restaurant, second hotel, second music theater, aquarium, a retail shopping and dining complex and other family attractions to come. Located 2.5 miles off Interstate 40 on Highway 66. Owned by Pete Maples.
<P>   * 275 acres. Sits 2.6 miles from I-40 on Highway 66, across the French Broad River from River Bluff Landing. Owned by Ben Frizzell.
<P>   * 1,200 acres, six miles from I-40 on Highway 66, adjacent to the Eagle Landing Golf Course, which B.A.S.S. has expressed an interest in acquiring if this site is selected. Owned by HMH, a partnership of Ted Miller and brothers Jack and Pete Herschend.

</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Nick Gates, News-Sentinel sportswriter</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">J</FONT>im Brown&#39;s 11-game scoring streak dating to Dec. 17 earned the center a trip to the fifth annual East Coast Hockey League All-Star Game at Charlotte next Tuesday night.
<P>   But Brown, who has 10 goals and 13 assists during the streak, isn&#39;t the only Cherokee making consistent offensive contributions.
<P>   Stephane Soulliere is prospering on a line with Brown and Dave Neilson since his return from Phoenix (International League). The Los Angeles Kings farmhand has a six-game points streak which includes four goals and six assists.
<P>   &#39;&#39;His confidence is very good at this point,&#39;&#39; Knoxville coach Barry Smith said. &#39;&#39;The puck is going in for him now. They weren&#39;t going in for him before (he went to Phoenix).&#39;&#39;
<P>    The combination of Matt Turek, Darren Johnson and Martin Tanguay is arguably Knoxville&#39;s best all-around line. Turek had two goals and was a plus-four in an 8-7 shootout loss to Charlotte on Sunday. Johnson also had a goal.
<P>   &#39;&#39;That is probably our best line,&#39;&#39; Smith said. &#39;&#39;Defensively they are sound.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Knoxville begins a four-game homestand tonight at 7 against the Richmond Renegades at Civic Coliseum.
<P>   
<P>   <B>IN LIMBO:</B> Forward Kyle Reeves, who aborted a four-player trade with Jacksonville by failing to report to the Lizard Kings, remains suspended.
<P>   &#39;&#39;He&#39;s not the hottest commodity,&#39;&#39; Smith said, indicating that interest in the 29-goal scorer is negligible.
<P>   
<P>   <B>TURNING IT AROUND:</B> Louisville is a perfect example of how a team can turn itself around with a trade or two.
<P>   The RiverFrogs began the season with a record 13-game losing streak. Since then, coach Warren Young&#39;s team is 16-7-4. It has have won nine of its last 10, including five in a row.
<P>   The biggest change is in goal, where Sandy Allen has made a remarkable contribution (13-4-1, 3.18 goals-against average) since coming over from Richmond.
<P>   But former Cherokee Tim Chase is part of the upgrade. The defenseman has three goals, five assists and is a plus-nine in nine games since being obtained from Jacksonville.
<P>   
<P> <B>EX-KEES WATCH:</B> Martin Masa has returned to Johnstown&#39;s lineup after missing about 10 games because of an injury. . . . Jim Latos is captain of the Louisians IceGators. The former New York Rangers farmhand has four goals in 30 games with 123 penalty minutes. . . . Goalie Cory Cadden appears to be odd man out in the crowded crease at South Carolina. Jason Fitzsimmons and Taras Lendzyk each made one start for the Stringrays last week.
<P>   
<P>  <B>INJURY UPDATES: </B>Knoxville defenseman Mike Vandenberghe did not make the trip to South Carolina for Tuesday night&#39;s game against the Stingrays because of a sore left wrist.
<P>   Wayne Anchikoski (concussion) was removed from injured reserve. Smith hopes to work him in slowly until he nears full speed.
<P>   
<P>   <B>TURNSTILES CLICKING:</B> The ECHL has passed the two million mark in attendance and is on pace to draw more than four million this season.
<P>    The record is 3.5 million set last season.

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Tennessee gets turn with EPA on Pigeon clean-up</B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Input sought on Champion's permit</FONT><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Frank Cagle, News-Sentinel managing editor</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Environmental Protection Agency comes calling today, asking what will satisfy Tennessee in issuing a permit for Champion International to operate its paper mill on the Pigeon River.
<P>   The answer, agreed on by recreation, tourism and business interests in East Tennessee, is expected to be presented to John Hankinson, director of EPA&#39;s Atlanta office, in a meeting today in Nashville with the Tennessee Environmental Council, an umbrella group representing more than 40 organizations.
<P>   On Monday the state of Tennessee filed a petition with the Office of Administrative Hearings in North Carolina requesting that the North Carolina decision to issue a wastewater discharge permit to Champion be overturned, that the decision to issue a color variance be overturned and that Champion be required to comply with Tennessee water quality standards for color in the Pigeon River at the state line as measured by in-stream sampling.
<P>   The petition also requests that Champion fund an independent investigation and risk assessment for the Waterville Reservoir.
<P>   According to David Jenkins, public policy director, American Canoe Association, these are at least some of the provisions Tennessee groups want in a new Champion permit:
<P>   * At the end of the five-year permit period the water at the state line should have a maximum of 10 color units. That&#39;s the color of mountain streams that flow in the area. (The Pigeon River below the Canton, N.C., plant is sometimes at 400 to 800 color units now, though it is diluted by mountain streams and some of the material settles in Waterville Reservoir before it gets to the Tennessee state line.)
<P>   * The maximum daily color limit during the life of the permit should be no more than 35 color units on any given day.
<P>   * The &#39;&#39;formula,&#39;&#39; which uses monthly and annual averages to &#39;&#39;prove&#39;&#39; the river is clear even when it is tea-colored, must be scrapped in favor of actual measurements, Jenkins said.
<P>   Environmental groups had earlier called on EPA to require a 30 color unit standard &#39;&#39;at the (discharge) pipe&#39;&#39; in Canton. But since North Carolina has issued Champion a permit, the focus now is on setting a standard for water as it enters Tennessee.
<P>   EPA regional director Hankinson also has offered to meet with state Attorney General Charles Burson today, though it appears unlikely, since Burson has been dealing with the EPA office in Washington.
<P>   EPA Administrator Carol Browner, at the request of Vice President Al Gore, has written Burson to say that her agency will review its decision to issue Champion another five-year exemption to the Clean Water Act for its Canton mill, which is 40 miles from the Tennessee state line.
<P>   The mill has been operating for the past seven years with an earlier variance.
<P>    Tennessee groups and state officials have objected to Champion getting permission to continue without stiffer clean-up requirements.
<P>   EPA has argued that Tennessee has a &#39;&#39;narrative&#39;&#39; rule, simply saying water should have &#39;&#39;no objectional color,&#39;&#39; rather than having a specific standard.
<P>   State officials say Tennessee has avoided having a numeric standard because it opens each permit to endless litigation and argument over standards.
<P>   &#39;&#39;No objectionable color seems clear enough,&#39;&#39; said David Sulkin of the environmental coalition.
<P>   Champion got its last variance based on a compromise that uses a complex formula of monthly and yearly averages and water samples taken downstream from clean-water tributaries. The formula results in answers that allowed EPA to decide the water met Tennessee standards, and the agency has signed off on North Carolina, issuing Champion another variance.
<P>   Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist, who has vowed to Cocke County residents to clean up the river, says it doesn&#39;t matter what the &#39;&#39;formula&#39;&#39; says, the water is &#39;&#39;not clean enough.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The Cocke County Chamber of Commerce and such environmental groups as the Dead Pigeon River Council have led a 10-year fight to clean up the river.
<P>    During this permitting process they have been joined by outdoor recreation groups and business interests. Sevier County Executive Larry Waters announced two weeks ago the formation of a group of regional tourism, business and elected officials to join the fight.
<P>    Burson has written Browner to say the state has the authority to restate its &#39;&#39;narrative&#39;&#39; with a more specific standard if that is what EPA wants.
<P>   Browner and Gore have indicated they would like Tennessee to provide documentation that will allow the EPA to revisit the Champion permit and satisfy Tennessee&#39;s concerns about the river.

        <font size="5">P</font>IGEON FORGE -- For 14-year-old
        David Jones, Pigeon Forge's annual Wilderness Wildlife
        Week has helped him blaze the path to his future. </p>
        <p>Jones of Forest City, N.C., was excused from his high
        school classes to attend all nine days of his third
        wildlife week in the Smokies. Exposure to the mountain
        experts, park rangers and scientists who present lectures
        and lead hikes from the Heartlander Country Resort has
        convinced Jones that he will chose a nature-related
        career. </p>
        <p>''I'm not sure what I want to do, but I know it will
        have something to do with the environment,'' Jones said
        Monday during a hike on the Old Sugarlands Trail. </p>
        <p>His bond with the Great Smoky Mountains National Park
        started three years ago, when Jones called Jim Renfro,
        the Smokies' air quality specialist, to ask questions
        about his science project. </p>

        <p>''We're always talking to people like that. You never
        know who you're going to touch,'' Renfro said. </p>
        <p>In Jones' case, the contact led to his first win in a
        regional science contest, sponsored by the U.S. Forest
        Service at his school. Last spring, Jones won the North
        Carolina state science contest competition in his age
        group for a study comparing the acquatic life in three
        streams. </p>
        <p>In addition to his science-fair projects, Jones has
        become the youngest member of the Southern Appalachian
        Mountain Initiative, Renfro said. The professional
        members of SAMI, a coalition of environmental agencies
        and groups, nominated Jones to become one of their
        colleagues last year. </p>
        <p>''He's already making a difference in the quality of
        life for other people who come to these mountains,''
        Renfro said. ''He can be anything he wants to be.'' </p>
        <p>This week, however, Jones is just being as attentive
        as he can, soaking up new knowledge about the Great Smoky
        Mountains. </p>
        <p>''I enjoy all the lectures, but I like being out on
        the hikes the best,'' said Jones, who is accompanied by
        his mother, Mary Jones. </p>
        <p>On Monday, the two joined a group of about 20 hikers
        and Charles Maynard, director of the Friends of the Great
        Smoky Mountains National Park and the author of several
        books on national parks. </p>
        <p>''Yellowstone is about five times the size of this
        park,'' Maynard explained, but it has only nine species
        of trees. ''The Smokies has 130 (tree) species and 1,200
        flowering plants. We've got a richness here unparalleled
        in the United States.'' </p>
        <p>For information about this week's programs or
        scheduled hikes, call 453-4106, ext. 1019. </p>

        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">S</font>haron Miller knew she was breaking
        new ground when she and Steve Arnett and Vickie Parkhurst
        left Valley Fidelity Bank 10 years ago to form The Trust
        Co. of Knoxville. </p>
        <p>For one, they were, in essence, starting a bank from
        scratch, requiring that they jump through all the
        regulatory hoops of any state-chartered bank, even though
        they would not be accepting deposits or making loans. </p>
        <p>For another, they were focusing on what some
        considered a greybeard of the financial industry -- most
        frequently thought of as low-yield, conservative
        management of estates. </p>
        <p>In 10 years, however, The Trust Co. of Knoxville has
        carved a niche that has spelled growth far beyond what
        was anticipated, with $425 million of trust assets under
        management. </p>
        <p>''Our long-term plan showed that we would have
        approximately $250 million of assets, not $400 million,''
        said Miller. ''We have been very pleased by our reception
        in the marketplace and the diversity of our business.'' </p>
        <p>Approximately 60 percent of the assets are held in
        employee benefit plans, including 401(k), profit-sharing
        and Employee Stock Ownership (ESOP) plans. </p>
        <p>''Our ESOP business has been a real surprise,'' said
        Arnett, senior vice president. ''It developed out of our
        profit-sharing business and our willingness to help
        customers reach creative solutions to problems.'' </p>
        <p>It also was an area that many traditional bank trust
        departments won't touch, unless the ESOPS are publicly
        traded, because of the conflicts that can develop between
        the best interests of the company and those of the
        employees. </p>
        <p>In addition to tricky valuation issues and dealing
        with regulators, the trustee must also walk a fine line
        between keeping management happy while at the same time
        remembering that it is the shareholders' interests that
        are paramount to the ESOP trustee, said Miller. </p>
        <p>The Trust Co. of Knoxville manages ESOPs for as few as
        30 employee-owners to as many as 5,000 in companies whose
        values range from as low as $2 million up to $70 million.
        The bulk of its business is in East Tennessee, but it has
        accounts in Middle Tennessee and North Georgia. </p>
        <p>Labeled even a bigger surprise is the growth in the
        personal trust area, which along with endowments
        represents the remaining 40 percent of the business. </p>
        <p>While personal trusts have been declining in other
        areas of the country -- as more people invest directly in
        mutual funds or through brokers -- it is one of the
        fastest-growing areas for The Trust Co. of Knoxville,
        said Amy Morton, trust officer. </p>
        <p>The reason? </p>
        <p>''We really do focus on customer service,'' said
        Miller. ''We're intensely focused on meeting customers'
        needs and that sometimes means that we don't do things
        real efficiently, but the way they want it done. We try
        to balance profitability with what they want. </p>
        <p>''Also, we don't talk down to people, and don't assume
        that we know what's right for them, but rather that we're
        working as a team with customers to meet their long-term
        goals and objectives.'' </p>
        <p>That's a difference from what one considers the old
        traditional trust department, Miller said. In the
        old-fashioned trust department, the attitude was ''You
        come to us and we'll give you some of your money if
        you've been good but don't ask us about it,'' she said. </p>
        <p>Miller also differentiates between her work and those
        of brokers: </p>
        <p>''We assume fiduciary responsibility. . . . It is our
        responsibility to act in best long-term interests of our
        individual accounts. . . . We're not making a sale, we're
        managing a relationship and a portfolio.'' </p>
        <p>The Trust Co. of Knoxville uses outside money managers
        to handle its investments. Last year, its stock return
        was 19.16 percent. Its five-year average annual stock
        portfolio return is 14.70 percent. </p>
        <p>The Knoxville company is one of seven freestanding
        state-chartered trust institutions in Tennessee,
        according to Vivian Lamb, a program administrator for
        trust institutions with the Tennessee Department of
        Financial Institutions. The trust institutions came under
        the department's jurisdiction as a result of law changes
        in the 1980s. Three trust companies are members of the
        Tennessee Bankers Association's trust division.
        Nationally, the Association of Independent Trust
        Companies counts 60 members. </p>
        <p>The Trust Co. of Knoxville was capitalized with
        $625,000, the majority of which was invested by Miller's
        family. It grew from zero assets under management to $15
        million by the end of the first year. </p>
        <p>While some accounts followed Miller and her associates
        from Valley Fidelity, Miller said, ''we went out and
        knocked on doors, talked with attorneys and accountants.
        . . . We got some referrals from sources we never dreamed
        of. . . .'' </p>
        <p>Miller also recently ''knocked'' on another door and
        in doing so, gained as a new principal in the company a
        well-known name in the Knoxville financial community. Jim
        Shelby retired as managing partner of Coopers &amp;
        Lybrand at year's end and has joined The Trust Co. of
        Knoxville as executive vice president and a board member.
        </p>
        <p>He will be involved in all aspects of the company
        business, said Miller. Board members, in addition to
        Miller, Shelby and Arnett, are Miller's father, D.R.
        Jones, an Atlanta attorney; Baxter Lee, president of
        Southeast Services Corp. and a former Federal Reserve
        Board member; and businessman J. Finbarr Saunders. </p>
        <p>Miller graduated from the University of Tennessee in
        1972 with a degree in finance. After selling life
        insurance for a year, she went to work for Valley
        Fidelity in 1973, starting in the trust department as an
        operation clerk. By 1979, she was senior vice president. </p>
        <p>She has been a groundbreaker in the Knoxville
        community as the first woman to serve on various boards.
        Currently, she is a Knoxville Utilities Board
        commissioner and is on the board of The Development Corp.
        of Knox County. </p>
        <p>While trust operations such as the Knoxville one are
        top acquisition targets for big banks, Miller said she
        plans to continue to operate The Trust Co. for a long
        time and has no plans to sell it. </p>

<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- Delegates to the 91st NCAA Convention on Monday changed two major tenets of recent reform in college athletics, allowing students on full scholarship to work during the school year and easing the requirements on freshman eligibility.
<P>    And both times the impassioned pleas of a member of the non-voting Student-Athlete Advisory Committee contributed to the passage.
<P>    The vote granting the right to work took 70 minutes of debate, defeat of a motion to table the issue, passage of an amendement and a 20-minute break to address concerns about the ramifications and confusion over the details -- not to mention two previous failed attempts at NCAA conventions.
<P>    &#39;&#39;What you saw occur was a shift in a major concept of this association,&#39;&#39; said Washington State president Sam Smith, chairman of the Presidents Commission, which favored the proposal. &#39;&#39;For years we would not provide any additional resources for athletes in any way. There was a breakthrough today.&#39;&#39;
<P>    By a vote of 169-150, Division I athletes will be allowed to earn extra money during the school year under certain conditions. Schools in Division I-A, the major football powers, actually defeated the vote among themselves but were outvoted by Divisions I-AA and I-AAA.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It may be an issue of emotion, but that&#39;s because it&#39;s important to student-athletes,&#39;&#39; said Bridget Niland, a former track athlete who is now a second-year law student at the State University of New York at Buffalo. &#39;&#39;We achieved some really great things today.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The biggest surprise might have been the altering of freshman eligibility rules, now known as Proposition 16. A proposal passed by a margin of 173-145 that will allow students who don&#39;t fully qualify as freshmen to get back a fourth year of eligibility if they have earned a degree.
<P>    The measure affects athletes known as partial qualifiers -- those who meet enough of the academic standards to go on scholarship but not enough to be eligible to participate. They can only have three years of eligibility under current regulations.
<P>    The measure may affect only a small number of students, but it is significant because it is the first alteration of the initial-eligibility requirements since Prop. 48, later tightened by Prop. 16, went into effect 10 years ago.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I think we were all surprised at that passing,&#39;&#39; said Meredith Willard, a University of Alabama gymnast.
<P>    The regulations on work and freshman eligibility go into effect Aug. 1.
<P>    The right-to-work legislation passed with a less restrictive policy than orginally written. A change Monday eliminated a provision that would have allowed employment only outside the playing season. Athletes under this legislation can work at any time during the school year. The legislation takes effect Aug. 1.
<P>    Several safeguards against abuses were included, however. Freshmen are not eligible to work. An affidavit stating the work is legitimate must be signed by the athlete. Earnings will be restricted to what is known as cost of attendance, a figure arrived at by computing incidentals and other minor expenses associated with going to school. According to NCAA figures, the amount will probably range between $1,800 and $2,400, depending on the school.
<P>    Athletes on partial scholarship in minor sports have been allowed to work and earn up to the cost of a full grant. They can now earn additional money up to cost of attendance.
<P>    Opponents predicted administrative nightmares in keeping track of athletes&#39; jobs and earnings and warned of potential for abuse. Some schools even believe they will have to hire an extra administrator just to oversee this program.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The logistics of monitoring the employment of hundreds of athletes boggles the mind,&#39;&#39; said Andrew Sorensen, president of the University of Alabama.

        Duo resumes cross-country canoe trip</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Morgan Simmons, News-Sentinel
        staff writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>OWNSEND -- Tom and Nancy Condon
        began their cross-country canoe trip from the West Coast
        in June 1986, stitching together a route along the
        Columbia, Snake, Yellowstone and Missouri rivers until
        they reached Kansas City, the expedition's halfway point.
        </p>
        <p>That first leg took them 13 months, largely because
        cold weather forced the couple to overwinter in Driggs,
        Idaho, in the Rocky Mountains. While in </p>
        <p>Driggs, they purchased a puppy they named Sirius,
        which, when spring came, joined them in the canoe all the
        way to Kansas City. </p>
        <p>This spring the Townsend couple will pick up where
        they left off. From Kansas City, they hope to paddle
        1,600 miles to the Atlantic via the Mississippi,
        Tennessee, Little Tennessee and Savannah rivers. </p>
        <p>It's been 10 years since the trip's first half. Nancy
        and Tom are now married, and Sirius, the puppy they got
        in Idaho, now weighs 100 pounds. </p>
        <p>''He won't be making the second half of the trip,''
        said Nancy. ''We didn't expect to wait this long. We just
        got caught up in everyday living.'' </p>
        <p>Nancy teaches environmental education at the Great
        Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont, and Tom manages the
        Cades Cove Visitors Center. Before leaving this April,
        they'll quit their jobs. </p>
        <p>Paddling 10 miles a day, they hope to go from the
        center of the country to the coast in about six months.
        The closest they'll come to Knoxville will be Lenoir
        City, where, after locking through at Fort Loudoun Dam,
        they'll paddle up the Tellico Lake to the finger lakes of
        the Little Tennessee River. </p>
        <p>From Fontana Lake, Nancy and Tom will transport their
        canoe and gear across the mountains to Lake Jocassee,
        along the border of North Carolina and South Carolina.
        Here, they'll follow the Savannah River, which, after a
        series of lakes, flows eastward to the Atlantic Ocean. </p>
        <p>Tom and Nancy said the waterways deliberately combine
        a mixture of wilderness and urban settings. </p>
        <p>''We wanted to hit the major rivers, the ones that
        bear the brunt of what we do to the environment,'' said
        Tom. ''The general public is more committed to big rivers
        than they were 10 years ago. There's been a new focus on
        water quality in communities like Knoxville, and we're
        anxious to see any improvements.'' </p>
        <p>The couple will use the same canoe they paddled the
        first half of the trip -- a 17-foot Kevlar-fiberglass
        canoe designed to handle large waves and high winds.
        They'll carry 300 pounds of gear and camp wherever they
        can, quitting each day at around 5 p.m. </p>
        <p>The first half of the trip taught them to respect
        thunderstorms and tides. Their first day out they paddled
        over an hour on the Columbia River, only to pull over to
        the bank and discover they had actually lost ground. </p>
        <p>''That first week was a struggle, even though we had
        prepared physically,'' said Nancy. ''I counted 30 bruises
        on me.'' </p>
        <p>On the Snake River in the desert of Idaho, where the
        summer heat reached 110 degrees, Nancy accepted the first
        cold beer of her life from a passing motorboater. The
        couple went around the worst whitewater sections, and
        while they never turned over, they did almost swamp while
        locking through the last dam on the Snake River. </p>
        <p>Nancy and Tom said the eastern half of their trip will
        carry them through more cities than the western half.
        After the Missouri River, they'll paddle 200 miles down
        the Mississippi, then 50 miles up the Ohio, where they'll
        pick up the Tennessee River. </p>
        <p>To help assure harmony at such close quarters, they'll
        trade off days sitting in the stern and being captain.
        They've learned to camp at the outskirts of major cities
        so they can paddle through and be on the other side by
        the next night. When they reach the mouth of the Savannah
        River, they'll beware the tides. </p>
        <p>''We met some fantastic people the first time, so
        we're looking forward to more of that,'' said Nancy. </p>
        <p>''As far as the blisters and bruises, after the first
        week, the body succumbs.'' </p>

        million from other schools, including $8.4 million
        originally slated for a new Brickey primary school. </p>
        <p>The money would be shifted within the school system's
        $123.7 million, 23-school capital plan to meet needs at
        13 schools. </p>
        <p>Commissioners decide today whether to put the
        rearrangement on their Jan. 27 agenda. </p>
        <p>''We're not talking about any new money,'' school
        board Chairwoman Margaret Maddox said. ''Unless the
        rearrangement is approved, I think it's really going to
        slow the (construction) process even more than it is
        now.'' </p>
        <p>The school construction plan has hit numerous
        roadblocks since the commission approved the first
        version almost three years ago. By fall 1994, projects
        began coming in 30 percent or more above original
        estimates, and commissioners delayed funding. </p>
        <p>In mid-1995, the Public Building Authority and Kaatz,
        Binkley, Jones &amp; Morris Architects were brought on
        board to provide expert help and, it was hoped, to
        improve commissioners' faith in the budgets. </p>
        <p>Dollars are needed to meet a variety of demands -- to
        fix old buildings, to keep pace with growing enrollments,
        to desegregate schools by building magnet facilities, to
        provide up-to-date technology, to comply with the federal
        Americans with Disabilities Act and to meet state law by
        providing enough classrooms that pupil-teacher ratios can
        be lowered. </p>
        <p>''You've got many, many large dollar-figure demands
        that . . . are all converging at one time,'' Maddox said.
        </p>
        <p>Even with expert opinions, however, commissioners
        won't be happy more money is needed on many projects this
        month. </p>
        <p>''If we had done properly, what we should have done in
        the beginning, we would have known pretty much what the
        accurate cost was,'' said Commissioner Mary Lou Horner,
        who chairs commission's Education Committee. ''Everything
        we've done in this particular program has cost a lot more
        (than expected).'' </p>
        <p>Horner is especially displeased the latest overruns
        will be funded with money originally slated for Brickey
        school, which is in her North Knox district. </p>
        <p>''I don't feel that the Brickey school should be the
        scapegoat to finish the projects that came in at the
        wrong amount,'' she said. </p>
        <p>Brickey has been delayed because more property is
        needed before construction can begin. </p>
        <p>''We're trying to buy land adjacent to the school, and
        the owner is an absentee (out-of-state) owner,'' said
        Larry Binkley, whose architectural firm is helping decide
        what should be included in each school. </p>
        <p>''I think there's some reluctance to sell, although
        there's been some positive discussions fairly recently.''
        </p>
        <p>The biggest single new expense is the kitchen at
        Austin-East High School. Almost $1.8 million must be
        added to the existing $16.7 million budget, with $1.25
        million of the increase aimed at upgrading food services
        facilities. </p>
        <p>Kitchen renovations have been delayed more than a
        decade due to lack of funding under the now-defunct city
        school system and the county system, which took over city
        schools in 1987. </p>
        <p>In September, a consultant told school officials the
        kitchen violates health and fire codes, the ADA and
        Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules.
        Omission of the kitchen while other renovations were
        planned was deemed a ''cumulative oversight'' by Maddox. </p>
        <p>As for extra money needed elsewhere, PBA Administrator
        Mike Edwards said, ''There isn't a (single) answer. Every
        pending issue is an issue in and of itself.'' </p>
        <p>Some were unforeseen conditions: Bad soil or
        foundation problems that required plans to be changed,
        for instance. </p>
        <p>Others were changes in what school officials decided
        each school needed, like wiring for computer networks,
        the Austin-East kitchen, handicapped-accessibility
        improvements to comply with ADA or more furnishings and
        equipment. </p>
        <p>Commissioner Madeline Rogero said ''there's always
        frustrations'' with increasing construction budgets, but
        it's too early to say what couldn't be avoided and what
        should have been anticipated months ago. </p>
        <p>''There's so many projects . . . and some of the
        (needs) are hard to know until you get into them,''
        Rogero said. </p>
        <p>Ten schools face potential shortfalls: Austin-East
        ($1.8 million); a new West Knox Middle School ($481,000);
        Vine Middle ($312,000); Ritta Elementary ($216,000);
        Sarah Moore Greene Elementary ($178,000); Christenberry
        Elementary ($65,000); Bearden High ($1.1 million);
        Sequoyah Elementary ($958,000); Whittle Springs Middle
        ($753,000); and Holston Middle ($369,000). </p>
        <p>Another -- Karns Middle School -- needs $550,000 for
        renovation designs. Bearden High and two others --
        Brickey and a new Northwest Elementary school in the
        Hardin Valley area -- need $2.8 million for land. </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>

        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">N</font>o deficit was insurmountable and
        no lead too safe. </p>
        <p>Less than 24 hours after playing tight defensive
        hockey -- nearly 39 minutes without a goal against
        Raleigh and 22 shots allowed -- the Knoxville Cherokees
        slipped into a defensive coma. </p>
        <p>The Charlotte Checkers, defending East Coast Hockey
        League champions, scored three consecutive goals in the
        third period and beat the Cherokees 8-7 in a shootout
        Sunday. </p>
        <p>A Civic Coliseum matinee crowd of 2,722 sat in
        disbelief as Charlotte (19-11-4) fought back after
        trailing 4-1, 5-2, 6-4 and 7-4. And it was no fluke. </p>
        <p>As the Checkers picked up steam -- they cranked off 30
        shots after managing five the first period -- the
        Cherokees wilted. Knoxville mustered only 15 after
        whistling 11 on net the first period. </p>
        <p>Injuries to Knoxville defensemen contributed to the
        disaster, but weren't completely to blame. </p>
        <p>The Cherokees were without Mike Vandenberghe, who
        suffered a serious wrist injury Saturday. Jamie Bird and
        Sean Halifax played hurt, diminishing their ice time and
        playing havoc with the penalty-killing units. Charlotte
        converted 4-for-6 power plays. </p>
        <p>Knoxville coach Barry Smith was forced to use forwards
        Ole Kjenstad and Dave Neilson on the blue line. </p>
        <p>''Not making excuses, but we're banged up,'' Smith
        said. ''I lost two more guys. It's a nightmare.'' </p>
        <p>To make matter worse, Knoxville defenseman Dan Chaput
        didn't have one of his better games. Smith said the
        verbal venom from the stands contributed to his
        performance. </p>
        <p>''All the fans . . . were on Chaput and they finally
        got to him and got him off his game,'' Smith said. ''We
        get yelled at on the road, we get yelled at home. We were
        winning 3-1 at the time (the abuse began).'' </p>
        <p>The first of two goals by veteran Darryl Noren -- they
        came 3:29 apart -- ignited the Checkers in the third
        period after Matt Turek scored the second of his two
        goals to put Knoxville (13-21-1) in front 5-2. </p>
        <p>Matt Robbins' power-play goal with 3:00 remaining tied
        it. It was the 19th goal for the Checkers' leading
        scorer. </p>
        <p>In the penalty-shot format tie-breaker, Charlotte's
        J.F. Aube and Robbins beat goalie Trent Cavicchi and
        Vaclav Nedomansky and Neilson answered for the Cherokees
        against Ken Shepard. </p>
        <p>Cavicchi made a dazzling pad save on Noren,
        Charlotte's fifth shooter, and momentum swung Knoxville's
        way. But All-Star Jim Brown, who already had two goals,
        failed to get the hat trick. </p>
        <p>Charlotte's Scott Kirton was denied and teammate Kimbi
        Daniels hit a post before Elick, the eighth shooter,
        scored. Shepard denied Martin Tanguay to end it. </p>
        <p>Brown, Darren Johnson, Turek and Kjenstad produced
        first-period goals after Kurt Seher's power-play goal put
        Charlotte in front. </p>
        <p>Kirton got his fifth goal in the second period, but
        Nedomansky restored a three-goal cushion with his 15th.
        The 45-foot blast came shorthanded. </p>
        <p>But nobody could put a body on David Brosseau in the
        second period and it cost the Cherokees. Brosseau fired
        in his 16th and 17th goals, and the Checkers kept the
        pressure up until they got came for -- a win. </p>

        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">R</font>eggie White -- NFL superstar and
        associate pastor of the Inner City Church in East
        Knoxville -- has put his sprawling Maryville estate up
        for sale. </p>
        <p>White, 35, a defensive end for the Green Bay Packers,
        has told The News-Sentinel that he and his family have
        received threats since the arson fire that destroyed the
        multiracial church in the early hours of Monday, Jan. 8,
        1996. </p>
        <p>White has declined to discuss the sale of his $2.4
        million home nor would he confirm if the sale is linked
        to the threats he said he has received. </p>
        <p>Instead, White alluded to a ''deal'' in the making,
        and he voiced a harsh concern that public disclosure of
        the sale might put that deal in jeopardy. </p>
        <p>Again, he refused to elaborate. </p>
        <p>According to a real-estate fact sheet, White is asking
        $2,395,833 for his two-story brick home located on West
        Hunt Road. </p>
        <p>A railroad line runs behind the property, which sits
        on a 30-acre tract that lies on the fringe of a landing
        pattern for jets en route to McGhee Tyson Airport. </p>
        <p>In mid-December -- not long after he declined to
        discuss the house -- White signed a $19 million deal: a
        five-year contract with the Green Bay Packers. </p>
        <p>In addition, five days after Christmas, White met with
        Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson's chief of staff and the
        director of the Wisconsin Housing and Economic
        Development Authority. </p>
        <p>In the governor's capitol conference room, they
        discussed ''Urban Hope,'' a proposal to help poor
        neighborhoods through increased enterprise and economic
        development, job opportunities and small-business
        creation. </p>
        <p>In Knoxville, White has been part of the Inner City
        Church's community development activities. </p>
        <p>The church's business affairs include a nondepository
        community investment bank that White helped create with a
        $1 million grant. </p>
        <p>According to Mark Bugher, secretary of the Wisconsin
        Department of Administration, White wants to use ''some
        of the most successful aspects'' of his Knoxville
        endeavor to pursue inner-city initiatives in Green Bay
        and, hopefully, Milwaukee. </p>
        <p>''We talked about general concepts, about what this
        program would do,'' Bugher said, adding the meeting did
        not focus on funding-related issues. </p>
        <p>''The ultimate goal,'' Bugher said, is for White to
        meet with Thompson to see how Urban Hope could be
        implemented ''and what state assistance could be provided
        to make his program as successful as possible.'' </p>
        <p>Bugher declined to say if White has discussed a
        personal financial investment in Urban Hope similar to
        the grant he gave to create the Knoxville bank. </p>
        <p>The bank was a prototype for at least 20 other
        community investment banks that White said he wanted to
        create nationwide. </p>
        <p>The Knoxville banking endeavor was a joint effort
        between White and a longtime friend, Jerry Upton, head of
        the Inner City Church's business activities. </p>
        <p>After the Inner City Church was set ablaze, White's
        religious ties to the church sparked a national outcry
        against racism. </p>
        <p>Despite a federal investigation, no arrests have been
        made. </p>
        <p>Upset that federal authorities had given polygraph
        examinations to Upton and his brother, the Rev. David
        Upton, senior church pastor, White publicly denounced the
        investigation and complained to Vice President Al Gore. </p>

        Sunbright trio found huddled in hollow log</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By John Stiles, News-Sentinel state
        editor</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">S</font>cott Edinboro credited the Lord, a
        hollow log and a redbone hound with saving his life and
        the lives of his step-brother and step-sister during
        Friday's snowstorm. </p>
        <p>However, others said Edinboro's own
        ''level-headiness'' carried them through the ordeal. </p>
        <p>Edinboro, 18, his stepbrother, Hollis ''L.J.'' Sexton,
        9, and stepsister, Taryn Sexton, 10, all of Sunbright,
        were treated at the University of Tennessee Medical
        Center Saturday after spending the night lost in the
        woods near the Morgan and Scott county line. </p>
        <p>Taryn suffered a touch of frostbite on her toes,
        according to Dr. Dan Diamond, chairman of the center's
        department of surgery. Edinboro and L.J. were being
        treated for hypothermia and were expected to be released
        Saturday afternoon. </p>
        <p>Edinboro gave this account of the trio's adventure: </p>
        <p>Because of snow, the three were out of school Friday
        when they decided to go for a hike shortly after noon.
        The family recently moved to Morgan County from Ohio.
        They had walked about an hour when they found an old road
        to an oil well. At some point they left the road and
        later realized they were lost. </p>
        <p>Just before nightfall they found a stream and decided
        to follow it, but as darkness fell and the snow
        intensified, they realized they'd better stop. </p>
        <p>Edinboro found an old log, and did something he'd seen
        lost people do on television: He kicked out the side of
        the log and made a shelter. </p>
        <p>Edinboro told Taryn to give her jacket to L.J., who
        was wearing a snowsuit. Edinboro then placed Taryn next
        to him, inside his jacket. </p>
        <p>''I didn't think we'd make it out of there,'' said
        Taryn. ''I was just laying there. It felt like someone
        took a hammer and crushed my toes,'' she said. </p>
        <p>Diamond said their socks were ''frozen'' from stepping
        in water as they walked. </p>
        <p>Edinboro's temperature was 96 degrees when he arrived
        at the hospital. </p>
        <p>''This was a level-headed bunch of young people,''
        said Diamond. ''We had a potentially lethal situation.
        Particularly the wet feet.'' He described Edinboro's
        temperature as ''worrisome.'' </p>
        <p>Edinboro said during the night they trio apologized to
        one another for all the bad things they had done to one
        another, and promised never to do those things again. </p>
        <p>''But, we probably will,'' said L.J. </p>
        <p>They also prayed, and that was what Edinboro credited
        with their survival. ''I just thank the Lord,'' he said. </p>
        <p>Their father, Hollis Sexton Sr., said he started
        looking for the children about 4 p.m. when they did not
        return. </p>
        <p>After a short search, Hollis returned home and called
        the police. Neighbors and rescue squads from several
        counties soon joined in the search. </p>
        <p>About 3:30 a.m. Saturday a neighbor's redbone hound
        that had followed the three on Friday afternoon and
        stayed with them began barking. That barking led rescuers
        to the huddled trio. </p>
        <p>One of the first to find them was the Rev. Lee Spence,
        pastor of the Church of God Prophecy in Robbins, Tenn.
        Once they were found they were carried about a mile to a
        pickup truck and then driven another three or four miles
        to a Lifestar helicopter. </p>
        <p>Diamond said the decision was made to send the
        helicopter because they didn't know the conditions of
        Edinboro and the children. </p>
        <p>''It was fun,'' Taryn said of her helicopter ride. </p>
        <p>Diamond said doctors at UT Medical Center were
        thinking of holding Taryn overnight for observation. One
        thing they will be watching for are signs of frostbite,
        such as blisters, on Taryn's toes. Diamond said small
        people are more susceptible to frostbite. </p>
        <p>L.J. and Taryn's mother, Connie Sexton, is a truck
        driver and was on her way home from Toledo, Ohio, when
        her children became lost. Hollis Sexton Sr. reached her
        through the trucking company as she drove. </p>
        <p>''I was worried, but I didn't cry,'' said L.J. of the
        ordeal. </p>
        <p>The National Weather Service recorded a low of 11
        degrees at McGhee Tyson Airport shortly after 8 a.m.
        Saturday. </p>

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Child care offered to shoppers</B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Stores seek, meet consumers' needs</FONT><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Jerry Nachtigal, Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT>HOENIX -- The idea seems so simple that Carolyn Scott wonders why more supermarkets don&#39;t offer babysitting, so parents can shop in peace without fidgety, fussy children in tow.
<P>    Scott watched through a window as her grandsons Justin, 4, and Hunter, 3, cavorted in the brightly decorated Kids Korner play center at a new Fry&#39;s Food & Drug store.
<P>    While Justin explored a plastic maze structure, Hunter stood transfixed, watching &#39;&#39;The Lion King&#39;&#39; on video. 
<P>   Nearby, a girl sat at a pint-sized blue desk assembling a puzzle and her sister played an interactive video game -- all under the watchful eye of day-care professionals.
<P>    &#39;&#39;You can&#39;t shop with those two because they&#39;re crying, they want the cookies, they want the candy, they want this, they want that,&#39;&#39; Scott said. &#39;&#39;You put them in (the play center) and they&#39;re happy.&#39;&#39;
<P>    In the fiercely competitive supermarket business, grocers are always looking for an edge over their rivals. Fry&#39;s, which operates 54 stores in Arizona, believes it&#39;s found one with free babysitting.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We look at it as, what can we do to add convenience for our customers?&#39;&#39; said Frank Bussemeier, manager of retail marketing and merchandising for Phoenix-based Fry&#39;s. &#39;&#39;One of the natural things we came up with was child care.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Fry&#39;s in early December became the first supermarket in Arizona to offer child care for its customers. 
<P>   So far the service is limited to the new store in north Phoenix, but it could be added to as many as a dozen other stores if successful, Bussemeier said.
<P>    Child-care centers that free parents of little grabbing hands have popped up in at least two dozen grocery stores across the country, but they are not yet an industry trend.
<P>    &#39;&#39;From our studies, we&#39;re finding there are not that many supermarkets that are offering it,&#39;&#39; said Stephanie Rosenblatt, a spokeswoman for the Food Marketing Institute, a Washington-based trade group. &#39;&#39;But if it&#39;s being offered, consumers are utilizing it.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Fry&#39;s Kids Korner is patterned after child-care centers operated at 13 Dallas stores by its corporate parent, Cincinnati-based Kroger Co.
<P>    Raley&#39;s, a Sacramento, Calif.-based supermarket chain, offers free Play Care centers in seven of its 80-plus stores. 
<P>   A handful of King Soopers stores in suburban Denver charge $3 per hour for child-care services; a Star Market in Boston watches customers&#39; children for $5 per hour, or $2 an hour if parents spend more than $100 in the store.
<P>    Why don&#39;t more grocery stores offer child care? 
<P>   Supermarket executives cite a lack of space, costs, security and the potential for lawsuits should a child be injured.
<P>    Child care is a convenience to parents, but Fry&#39;s also has the bottom line firmly in mind: If the kids are happy and properly cared for, it&#39;s hoped Mom or Dad will linger longer in the aisles and spend more money.
<P>    Fry&#39;s also hopes to encourage repeat business. If the children enjoy the play center, the next time Mom ponders what supermarket to shop, &#39;&#39;we think the children will help make the decision for her,&#39;&#39; Bussemeier said.
<P>    The child-care center is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, and holds a maximum of 15 children, ages 2 to 8, for up to 90 minutes each. Children must be potty trained and walking.
<P>    The parent or guardian who registers the child must present a valid driver&#39;s license with photo when checking the child in and out of the center. Both child and parent also receive matching identification wristbands.
<P>    Parents are given pagers so they can be summoned if their child needs a drink, to go to the bathroom or becomes unruly. Six monitors stationed around the store allow parents to keep an eye on the kids as they play.
<P>    All attendants have training in child care and undergo background checks, Bussemeier said. 
<P>   Access to the enclosed play center is limited to a door that can be opened only by an attendant inside.
<P>    &#39;&#39;What we did is follow every rule and regulation that there is in Arizona,&#39;&#39; said Priscilla Corbin, who runs the Kids Korner. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;We don&#39;t have to be licensed, but we follow everything as if we were to be licensed. We&#39;ve taken every precaution that we can think of.&#39;&#39;
<P>    John Ludwig, father of a 3-year-old daughter, said he would shop Fry&#39;s because of the child-care center.
<P>    &#39;&#39;With the pager, the wristbands and registration, it seems like they&#39;ve answered all our concerns as parents,&#39;&#39; he said. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;In this neighborhood there&#39;s a ton of kids. It&#39;s going to be a big success.&#39;&#39;

        <p><font size="5">G</font>reen Bay has the Lombardi
        Legend, the frozen tundra and the premier right-hander in
        the National Football League. Jacksonville has the next
        Steve Young and the Natrone Means of old. New England has
        an offensive troika it wouldn't swap for Aikman, Irvin
        and Smith. </p>
        <p>Carolina has great team chemistry. </p>
        <p>Green Bay has Brett Favre, the game's best quarterback
        whether pain-free or pain-killer free. Jacksonville has
        Mark Brunell and Natrone Means. New England has Drew
        Bledsoe, Curtis Martin and Terry Glenn. </p>
        <p>Carolina has great team spirit. </p>
        <p>The NFL's Final Four is curious enough based on who
        isn't included. There's no Dallas or San Francisco, no
        Bills or Broncos. </p>
        <p>The Packers have had 19 non-winning seasons since they
        won the Super Bowl. New England is a veteran of one Super
        Bowl, and it bungled that one so badly no one is
        clamoring for an encore. Jacksonville is a two-year-old
        NFL wonder, which could run and pass before it could
        walk. </p>
        <p>But Carolina is the most intriguing entry of all. </p>
        <p>Like the Jaguars, the Panthers have gone from
        expansionists to excellence in an astounding
        second-season rush. Unlike the Jaguars, the Panthers are
        star-challenged. </p>
        <p>Their best offensive players </p>
        <p>are a placekicker (John Kasay) and a tight end (Wesley
        Walls). Their starting tailback (Anthony Johnson) also
        covers punts. Their quarterback (Kerry Collins) is a
        second-year student of the pro game. </p>
        <p>The stars of their defense are Pro Bowl linebackers
        Sam Mills, Kevin Greene and Lamar Lathon. But that's not
        the strength of their team. Their strength is the team. </p>
        <p>It's almost too hokey for discussion, yet you can't
        visit the Carolina locker room without sensing it, can't
        comment on the team's success without alluding to it. The
        players talk about how they ''trust one another.'' In an
        era of stars, Carolina players seemingly thrive on the
        absence of stars, and the controversy that often
        accompanies them. </p>
        <p>The Panthers only make headlines on the sports page.
        They're as professional in postgame interviews as they
        are inside the 20. Their most serious transgression this
        season was Shawn King's repeated absences or tardiness
        (for which coach Dom Capers suspended him). Their biggest
        showboat is their mascot. </p>
        <p>This team is no accident. It was conceived by Jerry
        Richardson, a former 13th-round draft pick from Wofford
        College who made the roster of the world champion
        Baltimore Colts in 1959. He invested his playoff earnings
        of $4,864 in a Spartanburg, S.C., restaurant. It was
        called Hardee's. </p>
        <p>''I probably would have spent mine on stereo
        equipment,'' cornerback Toi Cook said. ''But I wish I was
        more like him.'' </p>
        <p>Maybe he is. The Panthers sought out Cook as much for
        what he brings to the locker room as the field. If this
        team is short on stars, it's loaded with leaders -- such
        as Cook, Mills, Lathon, Greene and Eric Davis. </p>
        <p>Richardson has tried to build his football team as he
        did his food franchise. When he visits his restaurants,
        he leaves this message -- usually on a paper napkin --
        for his employees: ''Hard Work, Teamwork, Harmony, Be
        Happy.'' </p>
        <p>He also encourages the same virtues from his Panthers.
        </p>
        <p>''Jerry wouldn't have tolerated (the off-the-field
        controversy) at Dallas,'' Cook said after the Panthers
        jolted the defending champions from the playoffs last
        Sunday. ''No way. Those players would have been gone.'' </p>
        <p>Cook appreciates Richardson's commitment to character,
        but laughs and wonders if he carries it to a ''ridiculous
        extreme.'' </p>
        <p>''Sometimes you have to be a little nasty out there,''
        Cook said. </p>
        <p>The Panthers don't lack toughness. In their last
        regular-season game, with a division championship on the
        line, they threw a fourth-quarter shutout, although the
        Pittsburgh Steelers ran 20 plays inside the Carolina 41.
        In last Sunday's 26-17 victory over Dallas, the Cowboys
        failed to score a touchdown on three different drives
        inside the 10. </p>
        <p>For all their accomplishments, the Panthers deserve
        their underdog role against the Packers, a hot team in a
        cold climate. But don't expect Carolina to cave in as the
        49ers did last week. </p>
        <p>The Panthers have eliminated the defending champions
        from the playoffs, beaten the 49ers twice in the regular
        season, won eight consecutive games after a 5-4 start.
        And, as Walls said after a September victory over the
        49ers, ''There's something special going on here in
        Carolina. If this didn't get the word out, we'll just
        keep beating people until everybody figures it out.'' </p>

        Service forecast 1 to 3 inches of snow in Chattanooga but
        called for 3 to 5 inches in the mountains and upper East
        Tennessee. At least 4 inches of snow could fall on the
        Cumberland Plateau. </p>
        <p>The Knoxville area was expected to get 2 to 4 inches
        of snow. The snowfall began in Knoxville around 2 p.m.
        Friday. Banks closed at 4 p.m., two hours earlier then
        normal, and many downtown workers left their jobs early

        <p>Sheriff's department dispatchers reported numerous
        traffic jams and minor accidents during Friday morning's
        rush hour. The only fatalities apparently were in West
        Tennessee. Two people were killed in a wreck in Madison
        County, and two others died in a McNairy County accident.
        </p>
        <p>In Middle Tennessee early Friday, two sections of
        Interstate 24 were closed briefly because of accidents.
        The Highway Patrol said interstates in East Tennessee
        were all passable late Friday, but they warned drivers to
        be wary on bridges and ramps. Many secondary roads were
        covered with a layer of ice and snow. </p>
        <p>In the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, workers
        cleared fallen trees from U.S. 441 in North Carolina,
        said spokeswoman Nancy Gray. On the Tennessee side of the
        park, the highway was plowed and sanded. Later, however,
        ice and snow forced the road to be closed again. </p>

        </p>
        <p>She lies unclaimed in a Loudon County funeral home. </p>
        <p>She is a mother, somebody's daughter and maybe
        someone's sister. </p>
        <p>She soon will be buried with no name. </p>
        <p>''I kind of feel sorry for her,'' Tennessee Highway
        Patrol Trooper Daniel Ruskey said. ''This is my first one
        like this.'' </p>
        <p>The unidentified woman died about 5:25 p.m. on Dec. 28
        when she was struck by a car at the Interstate 40 and
        Interstate 75 split in Loudon County. </p>
        <p>''She was attempting to cross over the westbound lanes
        on I-40,'' Ruskey said. ''The man who struck her tried to
        avoid her but couldn't.'' </p>
        <p>No charges were placed and Ruskey went about the
        process of determining the victim's identification so
        relatives could be informed. But the woman had no wallet,
        purse, or backpack to provide a clue as to her name. </p>
        <p>''The only item she did have on her were three pieces
        of paper with telephone numbers and different names,''
        Ruskey said. </p>
        <p>Ruskey discovered one of the names and telephone
        numbers on the scraps of yellow legal paper belonged to a
        Clarke County, Miss., bail bondsman. The trooper
        discovered the victim had been out of the county jail in
        Mississippi for less than 24 hours when she died. </p>
        <p>''We found out she had been arrested in Clarke County
        about 19 days prior to her death for running in
        traffic,'' Ruskey said. </p>
        <p>While Ruskey was able to obtain booking pictures from
        Clarke County, Miss., officials, they didn't know the
        woman's name. </p>
        <p>''During her stay at the jail, she would give jailers
        a different name every day,'' Ruskey said. ''We
        interviewed some of the inmates and they indicated she
        had been in a mental hospital.'' </p>
        <p>Ruskey has researched the names listed on the woman's
        scraps of paper and the ones she gave Mississippi jailers
        and has come up with nothing. The names belong to women
        living in Louisiana and Washington. </p>
        <p>Ruskey tried to follow up on any leads in Shreveport,
        La., because the unidentified woman listed Shreveport in
        the Mississippi jail as her hometown, but again found
        nothing. </p>
        <p>''It's almost like she wanted to disappear without a
        name,'' Ruskey said. </p>
        <p>After the victim served 18 days in the Clarke County
        jail, law enforcement officials ''transported her to the
        county line and dropped her off,'' Ruskey said. </p>
        <p>From Interstate 59 in Mississippi, the unidentified
        woman hitchhiked to the Watt Road exit on I-40 in Knox
        County. While Ruskey can place the woman at the truck
        stop at Watt Road, he found no one who spoke with her. </p>
        <p>Ruskey and his supervisor, Sgt. Charles Laxton, did
        find another hitchhiker who spoke to the woman on the day
        of her death, but now he has disappeared. The hitchhiker,
        Andrew Bach, who lives in Knoxville and is in his
        mid-30s, is being sought for further information. </p>
        <p>Ruskey said the woman's fingerprints have been sent to
        the FBI, but that process takes months. By then, the
        woman will be buried in a pauper's grave with no name. </p>
        <p>The woman's body contained no tattoos. The only scars
        on her were those indicative of giving birth, Ruskey
        said. </p>
        <p>Anyone with information that could identify the victim
        is asked to call 693-7311. </p>

        <font size="5">F</font>red Mershad, president and chief
        executive officer of Proffitt's Division of Proffitt's
        Inc., has been named president and CEO of The
        Elder-Beerman Stores, a 123-store retailer that sought
        bankruptcy protection over a year ago. </p>
        <p>Elder-Beerman announced Mershad's appointment Friday
        and said he would begin work for the Dayton, Ohio-based
        company on Monday. </p>
        <p>Mershad joined Alcoa-based Proffitt's Inc. in May 1994
        as executive vice president of merchandising and sales
        promotion for the Proffitt's Division after the company
        wrote off $2.2 million in inventory. Mershad was credited
        with giving the division a better focus and sales and
        earnings subsequently improved. </p>
        <p>As Proffitt's Inc. acquired Younkers and Parisian in
        1995 and 1996, the Proffitt's Division became the
        smallest of the four divisions, which also includes
        McRae's stores. </p>
        <p>Proffitt's Inc. said a successor to Mershad will be
        named shortly. </p>
        <p>The Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. operates about 52
        department stores in seven states throughout the Midwest.
        Its Bee-Gee Shoe Division operates about 71 shoe stores
        in seven states. Sales in 1995 totaled $540 million. </p>
        <p>The company, which traces its roots back 114 years,
        filed for bankruptcy protection in October, 1995, and the
        case is pending in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dayton. The
        company has until February 17 to submit a reorganization
        plan. </p>
        <p>Max Gutmann, chairman and chief executive officer,
        will remain as chairman of the organization. Herbert
        Glaser, Elder-Beerman's president and chief merchandising
        officer, will become vice chairman. The two men returned
        from retirement to lead what the company called the
        turnaround of operations while in bankruptcy. They will
        remain to assist Mershad in assumming his new duties. </p>
        <p>''While the company has made astonishing progress
        during the bankruptcy period, nevertheless it has been a
        priority for some time to identify my successor,''
        Gutmann said. </p>
        <p>''Fred Mershad fits the slot of CEO and has the
        experience and expertise to provide the platform needed
        for Elder-Beerman to emerge from bankruptcy in the
        strongest possible position. We are very fortunate to
        have found a new chief executive officer with the depth
        and breadth of merchant experience that Fred will
        bring,'' Guttmann said. </p>

</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Bill Luther, News-Sentinel sportswriter</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>HARLOTTE, N.C. -- When Darrell Waltrip takes the green flag that starts the Daytona 500 on Feb. 16, it could be his final full-season run on the Winston Cup tour.
<P>    The 1997 season marks the 25th anniversary for the Kentucky native, who has won 84 Winston Cup races to go with three championships.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Physically, I&#39;m prepared, because I didn&#39;t show up last year,&#39;&#39; said Waltrip, referring to his poor showing. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ll have to take a hard look if 1997 is another 1996. But I can tell you 1998 is not going to be a retirement year. How this season goes will determine what I do in 1998. I will run some races, how many I don&#39;t know.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The Western Auto-sponsored Monte Carlo for the 500 will have a chrome look. Other selected races will carry colors used while driving for Gatorade, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Tide and Budweiser.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I&#39;d like to run the silver car under the lights because it will look like a black spot going around the track,&#39;&#39; Waltrip said. &#39;&#39;I told Billy France (NASCAR president) I had a good paint job and he asked why. I don&#39;t know if NASCAR will let me do it.&#39;&#39;
<P>    From the day Waltrip drove his first Cup race in 1972, he wasn&#39;t afraid to speak his piece. He was nicknamed &#39;&#39;Jaws&#39;&#39; by several competitors.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I&#39;d like to work that theme in with the cars, but I don&#39;t know if we could work that out,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>    Waltrip, whose 50th birthday is Feb. 5, is hopeful the silver car will take him to the next level.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I had hoped to have won 100 races by the time I was 50. But I wouldn&#39;t count it out. I might win 16 races this year,&#39;&#39; he said with tongue in cheek. &#39;&#39;If we could get Jeff Gordon&#39;s cars, we could do it. There were five races last year that I had to park . . . that&#39;s how bad things were.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I do want it to be a fun year for the media and fans. I want it to be special and I want to make great strides. If you have the better car, you can win. If I should win the 500, the car will go directly to the NASCAR museum. Should I win other races, the car will be given to a museum.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Waltrip&#39;s last victory came in the 1992 Southern 500 at Darlington, S.C.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I have had a great career and I&#39;ll be glad to have been a part of the sport when I do retire,&#39;&#39; Waltrip said. &#39;&#39;Look back at 1996 and you&#39;d have thought I had retired. I have worked hard to give myself a chance. I want one (last full season) to be memorable.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Jeff Hammond and Waddell Wilson, both past crew chiefs for Waltrip, have been brought together in an effort to make it a better prepared team.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This is the strongest group of guys I&#39;ve had since I started as a driver/owner in 1991,&#39;&#39; Waltrip said. &#39;&#39;The car may not be the hottest, but it&#39;s a good one. Ten years ago, I looked at this as a dream team and since then I&#39;ve told Waddell that (making the mistake) was our problem.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Of all the cars driven during a career spanning 689 races, the Gatorade was his favorite.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Those cars were ahead of their time. They were green and some drivers didn&#39;t want to park beside them,&#39;&#39; Waltrip recalled. &#39;&#39;They thought green was a no-no. The Tide cars were the next best.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Three drivers -- Richard Petty, David Pearson and Ned Jarrett -- already in the International Motor Sports Hall of Fame were among a crowd of 150 to attend the gathering at the First Union Bank.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Those guys were my heroes and this is one of the happiest times of my career,&#39;&#39; Waltrip said. &#39;&#39;It was great to compete against them (Petty and Pearson). They had some fantastic cars.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Television could be the next stop for Waltrip.
<P>    &#39;&#39;If I quit tonight,&#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;I could do TV work the rest of my life. The problem with that is that I think I can still win races. When the clock starts for the Daytona 500, you can&#39;t call a timeout. I&#39;m still excited.&#39;&#39;

        <font size="5">L</font>ongtime lawyer and Knox County
        Election Commission member Courtney Pearre today will be
        named legal counsel to Gov. Don Sundquist. </p>
        <p>Pearre, 52, replaces his former law partner, Hardy
        Mays, in the position. Mays recently took over as deputy
        to the governor after Peaches Simpkins resigned that
        post. </p>
        <p>Pearre will be the only member of Sundquist's Cabinet
        from Knox County. </p>
        <p>The move creates another opening on the Election
        Commission. </p>
        <p>Pearre will resign from the Election Commission and
        his law firm of Baker, Donelson, Bearman &amp; Caldwell
        and plans on taking over as legal counsel in a week or
        two. </p>
        <p>He will make about $80,000 a year. </p>
        <p>A Nashville native, Pearre graduated from the
        University of Tennessee in Knoxville with a bachelor's
        degree in business administration. He then obtained his
        law degree in Knoxville from the UT College of Law. He
        has practiced law in Knoxville for 22 years. </p>
        <p>Pearre and his wife, Carolyn, will maintain their
        residence in Knox County. She is principal at The Center
        School. </p>
        <p>Pearre's new position creates more discussion on
        Saturday for the GOP legislative delegation in a meeting
        to discuss a replacement on the Election Commission for
        the late Hazel Showalter. </p>
        <p>Now they will have two slots open for Republicans. And
        the list to fill the positions is growing. </p>
        <p>State Rep. Jim Boyer, R-Corryton, who is chairing the
        replacement process, said Monday the three primary names
        he knew of were West High School Principal Donna Wright,
        Gibbs High School librarian Rebecca Longmire and Halls
        businessman John Tindell. </p>
        <p>Those showing interest during the week has grown. That
        list includes Knox County GOP Chairman Mike McClamroch;
        former school board members Mike Prince and Steve Hill;
        Knoxville lawyer Steve Roth; former state Rep. Joe
        Birchfield; former Knox County Commissioner Fred
        Flenniken; former county GOP Chairman Larry Smith;
        community activist Anne Dingus; and weekly newspaper
        publisher Phil Hamby. The seven-member GOP legislative
        delegation is scheduled to meet and discuss the
        replacements, and possibly vote, at 8:30 a.m. Saturday in
        the City County Building's Small Assembly Room. </p>

        <font size="5">A</font> Knoxville man allegedly raped the
        17-year-old twin sister of his girl friend and then
        offered to let her hold weapons on him while they talked
        about the incident, authorities said. </p>
        <p>Justin Smith, 21, who gave a Wellington Drive address,
        was booked into the Knox County jail on a rape charge at
        8:18 p.m. Wednesday, about seven hours after the alleged
        incident occurred at a West Knoxville apartment complex,
        said Knoxville Police Department Investigator Dwight
        Loop. Smith later was released on a $15,000 bond. </p>
        <p>Authorities said Smith had gone to the apartment at
        Concepts 21 off Gallaher View Road to wait for his girl
        friend to return from school. While there, Smith
        allegedly raped the sister. </p>
        <p>The alleged victim, who did not attend school because
        she had received a General Educational Development
        equivalency diploma, lived at the residence with her
        mother and sister. </p>
        <p>After the alleged incident occurred, the victim locked
        herself in the bathroom, Loop said. </p>
        <p>In the meantime, he said, Smith allegedly retrieved a
        knife from the kitchen and a small-caliber gun from his
        car. He then tried to slip them underneath the bathroom
        door, telling the girl she could hold the weapons on him
        while they talked, authorities said. </p>
        <p>Loop said she eventually came out of the bathroom and
        went next door to call police. Smith did not try to stop
        her, he said. </p>
        <p>Smith left the apartment but returned a short time
        later and was taken into custody by KPD officers. The
        girl was taken to Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center
        for evaluation. </p>
        <p>Smith declined to comment Thursday. </p>

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>BASS drops one of four Sevier sites considered for $50 million resort</B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Two locations are in other states</FONT><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Eleni Chamis, News-Sentinel business writer</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>ne of four Sevier County sites has been dropped from consideration for the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society&#39;s $50 million corporate headquarters and family resort, a BASS official said Thursday.
<P>   Three remain in contention.
<P>   BASS now is considering a total of five sites, including one in Daytona Beach, Fla., and one in Birmingham, Ala., said Diehl Unger, president of BASS Outdoor America. He also said discussions are ongoing with potential investors and joint venture partners.
<P>   Jess Davis, who owns the 187-acre Sevier site which has been dropped, said Thursday he&#39;s had no official word from BASS officials, but it&#39;s been a while since he&#39;s had any verbal contact with them at all.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I hope they choose Sevier County but we&#39;re not really counting on them taking our property,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   His property, one mile off U.S. 441 adjacent the Pigeon Forge city limits, is used for car shows and rodeos.
<P>    Unger said Thursday he realizes there is frustration with the lack of a decision in a search process that began in the summer of 1995. So, BASS officials have quit setting deadlines.
<P>   He also acknowledged that BASS&#39; own employees in Montgomery were weary of the search, and that some weren&#39;t particularly eager to leave.
<P>   &#39;&#39;You can&#39;t please everybody all the time,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;The decision was made some time ago that it was probably best to leave Montgomery.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We thought it would be much easier and much quicker than this. It has turned out to be very complicated for us. We&#39;re not professionals at this. In many cases, the company is betting the whole farm on this move and this project . . . .
<P>   Unger said the group is meeting on a daily basis, talking with potential new investors, joint venture partners, and property owners. &#39;&#39;Some are national-type investors,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;There are many on Wall Street as well. . . . some have been regional people in East Tennessee.&#39;&#39;
<P>
<P>   He denied rumors that Jemison Investments, a Birmingham-based group which owns less than 50 percent of BASS-- he declined to give the exact percentage of ownership -- is actively working to influence BASS to stay in Alabama. BASS chairwoman and CEO Helen Sevier owns more than 50 percent of the company, according to Unger.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Jemison is our financial partner; they have key ownership in our company,&#39;&#39; said Unger. &#39;&#39;They would like to see us stay in Alabama. Clearly as viable businesspeople, they also want to do what is best for the company. . . . In the end, they do not take a very active role in management of this company. . . . &#39;&#39;
<P>   Site selection and cost have not been finalized, issues which he contends are the most prohibitive to the process.
<P>   &#39;&#39;That is a very sizeable investment in that area,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;When you&#39;re talking $4,000 to $8,000 a frontage foot and we need several hundred acres . . . that&#39;s a difficult burden on a business plan.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We want to be where the people are,&#39;&#39; he added. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s a key consideration. Sevier has a lot of the right type of people. So does Daytona Beach, with 30 million families that go right by their front door on the way to Disney. Birmingham is a very residential market very close to Atlanta. We think we&#39;ve got three potential markets that work.&#39;&#39;

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Texas track to become racing jewel</B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> MTSU grad has big hand in directing speedway</FONT><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Bill Luther, News-Sentinel sportswriter</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>HARLOTTE, N.C. -- Eddie Gossage is quickly making a name for himself in Texas.
<P>    Gossage, who grew up in Middle Tennessee, took a part-time job with Nashville Tennessean sports department while still attending Middle Tennessee State. But it didn&#39;t last long.
<P>    Since that shortcoming Gossage has climbed the ladder in stock car racing. It began at Nashville Speedway, followed by a two-year stint at Bristol International Raceway. Then he joined Miller Brewing before accepting the public relations position at Charlotte Motor Speedway.
<P>    He stands near the top of the ladder at the present time as executive vice president and general manager of Texas Motor Speedway.
<P>    Gossage is listed among the &#39;&#39;Seven to Watch in &#39;97&#39;&#39; by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The list is a Tarrant County business compilation of people most likely to make headlines this year.
<P>    When O. Bruton Smith decided to expand his Speedway Motorsports into the Southwest, Gossage left Charlotte Motor Speedway to oversee construction of the new track.
<P>    The $130 million facility with 160,061 permanent seats is expected to be completed in March.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We built Texas Motor Speedway to be the most fan-friendly facility anywhere,&#39;&#39; Gossage said. &#39;&#39;From every perspective we wanted our events to be a pleasurable experience for our guests.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Examples include 1,595 seats for handicapped fans, 2,450 toilets -- two women&#39;s fixtures to each one for males -- and 208 luxury skyboxes served by 21 elevators.
<P>    TMS is the third Smith-owned track to have installed lights in order to race at night. Bristol and Charlotte are the others.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We are very happy to be in the Fort Worth-Dallas area,&#39;&#39; Gossage said. &#39;&#39;We want the speedway to be a good corporate citizen. We want success and prosperity not only for the track, but also the surrounding communities. Everyone should and will benefit from our presence.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Estimates indicate the track will generate approximately 3,400 jobs and economic impact of $160 million.
<P>
<P>    <B>MORE DOLLARS:</B> Richard Childress has gathered three associate sponsors for the 1997 season.
<P>    Snap Off Tools has been added for four years, Food City and Burger King three years.
<P>
<P>    <B>TITLE RUN: </B>Rusty Wallace says it&#39;s been too long since winning the 1989 Winston Cup championship. On Thursday he said &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve told the guys we&#39;ve got our best chance to win in this decade. They know it all over the shop. Every member of the team is back, so I guess I feel a little cocky.&#39;&#39;
<P>
<P>    <B>500 CHASER:</B> Could this be the season Dale Earnhardt puts his name on the list of Daytona 500 winners? 
<P>    The way the seven-time champion talks he has to feel it could happen Feb. 16.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Racing is getting more competitive every year,&#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;A 500 win would be great. So would an eighth championship (which would break a tie with retired Richard Petty).&#39;&#39;
<P>
<P>    <B>CHARTER INDUCTEE: </B>Richard Petty, who retired with 200 Winston Cup victories and seven driving championships, is the first to enter The North Carolina Auto Racing Hall of Fame.
<P>    Still active in the sport as a team owner, Petty was enshrined Wednesday night. From the time he won in 1960, Petty has been known as one of the fan favorites.
<P>    Winning as a car owner wasn&#39;t as easy as those years he was driving. Bobby Hamilton gave &#39;&#39;The King&#39;&#39; his first win Oct. 27 at Phoenix, Ariz., after 117 races as an owner.

        <font size="5">M</font>AYNARDVILLE -- Hotdogs and french
        fries seemed to be the popular menu items at lunchtime at
        the Hillbilly Market this week, but the hot topic for
        discussion was what to name Union County's new high
        school. </p>
        <p>The school board voted in December for the new
        facility to be named Union County High School. The
        $15million school that will accommodate about 900
        students is scheduled to open in August. </p>
        <p>The board's decision has stirred up many longtime
        Maynardville residents. They want the high school to
        continue to be named in honor of Horace Maynard, the
        lawyer who worked free of charge in the 1850s when Union
        County was created. </p>
        <p>''Horace Maynard was a statesman here,'' said E.J.
        Ailor, local funeral home owner who wants to keep the
        original name. ''I don't think it's worth a hoot to
        change the name of the school.'' </p>
        <p>He went from table to table at the market, urging
        customers to sign a petition calling for officials to
        keep Horace Maynard as the name of the school. </p>
        <p>''It's these outsiders that want to change the name,''
        Ailor explained. ''In 1972, Union County had a population
        of 8,100 and some odd. Now there's over 16,000. We're
        glad to see people move in here, but they don't need to
        start trying to change things.'' </p>
        <p>School Superintendent David Coppock said it makes
        little difference to him what the name of the new school
        is. </p>
        <p>''But it matters to people in other sections of the
        county,'' he said. ''The people that don't want to change
        are the ones right around here in Maynardville.'' </p>
        <p>Bonnie Peters, county historian, is the person who
        instigated the petitions, but she said she did not
        realize the school board had already voted for the school
        to be named Union County High. </p>
        <p>''I began to make inquiries when I passed the school
        and saw a sign with Union County High School on it,'' she
        said. </p>
        <p>Peters said the name of the school should keep the
        historical perspective. </p>
        <p>''Horace Maynard came to Knoxville in 1838 to be a
        member of the faculty of East Tennessee College, the
        forerunner of the University of Tennessee,'' she said.
        ''When the lawsuit developed over the establishment of
        Union County in the 1850s, he was there to help.'' </p>
        <p>Maynard also was a politician. He was the last
        non-Republican elected to the U.S. Congress from the 2nd
        District when he ran in the 1850s as a member of the Know
        Nothing Party. During the Civil War, Maynard switched
        parties and became the first Republican elected to
        Congress from the 2nd District. He later was U.S.
        postmaster general. </p>
        <p>Coppock said the historical significance of Horace
        Maynard will not be lost with the renaming of the high
        school. </p>
        <p>''The old high school will be converted to a middle
        school,'' he said. ''It's going to be called Horace
        Maynard Middle School. So his name will still be
        around.'' </p>
        <p>Although most of those at the Hillbilly Market said
        they didn't like the idea of a new name for the high
        school, Stephanie Kitts said she does. </p>
        <p>''I'm all for changing the name,'' said Kitts, a 1988
        graduate. ''It'd be nice for it to be something
        different. It's been that (Horace Maynard) forever.'' </p>
        <p>Maynardville Mayor Bill Graves is for keeping the old
        name. </p>
        <p>''I don't like the idea of changing it,'' he said.
        ''It's been Horace Maynard High School ever since I can
        remember. I don't know why anybody would want to change
        it.'' </p>
        <p>Leroy Alfrey echoed Graves' sentiments with a biblical
        reference. </p>
        <p>''God said he was the Alpha and the Omega, and you
        can't change that,'' he said. ''So, you shouldn't change
        the name of the school.'' </p>
        <p>John Inklebarger said people ought to hold county
        officials accountable. </p>
        <p>''The school board and the County Commission ought to
        be held responsible,'' he said. ''If they change the name
        of the school, vote 'em out. Get 'em out of there.'' </p>
        <p>Peters said she plans to take the petitions to the
        next Union County Commission meeting. </p>

<FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>AK RIDGE -- Organized labor is anxious to help recruit new businesses to Oak Ridge, but changing the perception of labor as a problem is critical, union leader Carl &#39;&#39;Bubba&#39;&#39; Scarbrough said Wednesday.
<P>    &#39;&#39;If we can&#39;t change these perceptions, nothing is going to work,&#39;&#39; Scarbrough told a state legislative committee looking for ways to mitigate the impact of layoffs at the government&#39;s Oak Ridge facilities.
<P>    Scarbrough is president of the Atomic Trades and Labor Council, which represents 16 unions at DOE&#39;s Y-12 Plant and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
<P>    Hourly employees, including many skilled-crafts workers, are willing to work for any companies that come to Oak Ridge, but there needs to be a partnership, he said.
<P>    Scarbrough said he has worked with several economic development organizations in the region, adding, &#39;&#39;I have not run off one industrial recruit.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Although the Oak Ridge workers won&#39;t accept low wages, their pay should not be a limiting factor either, he said.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Labor is not a problem . . . You can afford us,&#39;&#39; Scarbrough said. He used a chart to show that wages and benefits were only a fraction of the cost of doing business at the DOE plants.
<P>    If companies coming to Oak Ridge won&#39;t compensate workers for their training and experience, some companies elsewhere will, he said.
<P>    George Jones of the Knoxville Building and Trades Council, which represents 18 unions, said more than half of the Oak Ridge construction jobs have been lost over the past 5 or 6 years. 
<P>    Jones said construction workers are anxious to get to work on Oak Ridge projects, but he said they must have contractual guarantees. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;Intent&#39;&#39; often gets lost in the process, he said.
<P>    Al Trivelpiece, director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, said near-term budget prospects for ORNL are pretty stable, but he said partnerships with the state and local communities are more important than ever in safeguarding facilities.
<P>    Trivelpiece cited Tennessee&#39;s commitment to help with funding for the proposed $1 billion Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL, and he said more of those kinds of arrangements may be needed.
<P>    Jim Hall, DOE&#39;s manager, said one of the government&#39;s objectives is to lower costs to make Oak Ridge plants competitive for more projects.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We have to show that putting your money in Oak Ridge is a good investment,&#39;&#39; he said.

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>M4 changing leadership, restructuring operations</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge bureau</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>AK RIDGE -- M4 Environmental has a new leader, and more changes are on the way.
<P>    Millard Firebaugh, a retired Navy admiral who joined M4 six months ago as technical director, was named this week to replace Dr. Robert Merriman as president and chief executive officer.
<P>    M4 is a limited partnership founded in 1994 by Lockheed Martin and Molten Metal Technology. Officials at the parent companies said Wednesday they&#39;re looking at ways to restructure M4 to &#39;&#39;reduce redundancies&#39;&#39; in the organization and make operations more efficient.
<P>    There was speculation in Oak Ridge that the limited partnership might be dissolved, but there was no confirmation of such a plan.
<P>    &#39;&#39;All options are open for review,&#39;&#39; said Jerry Langheim of Lockheed Martin&#39;s Energy & Environment Sector.
<P>    M4 Environmental uses catalytic extraction technologies developed by Molten Metal for recycling hazardous and radioactive wastes.
<P>    Whatever the outcome of the internal restructuring, to be completed by April 1, M4 will retain an operational presence in Oak Ridge, Langheim said. There apparently is no guarantee, however, that the partnership&#39;s headquarters will remain here.
<P>    M4&#39;s Technology Center in Oak Ridge develops and tests waste-treatment facilities and also houses small production units.
<P>    The main focus of the M4 review will be to eliminate overlapping functions of the limited partnership, officials said.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The partners have agreed to explore ways to enhance the business relationship,&#39;&#39; said Jay Woodruff of Molten Metal.
<P>    Asked if Lockheed Martin was dissatisfied with progress at M4, Langheim said, &#39;&#39;I think that&#39;s too hard of a statement. . . . The key thing of concern is redundancies.&#39;&#39;
<P>    There have been rumors that the molten-bath technologies used by M4 to break down wastes were not working as planned in large-scale units, but Woodruff emphatically denied that.
<P>    &#39;&#39;All the technical results that we have gotten in the last year have only increased our enthusiasm for the technology,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>    Woodruff said M4 was in the &#39;&#39;squirrelly position&#39;&#39; typical at companies in transition between technology development and commercial operations. &#39;&#39;We are going to continue to have skeptics until we have more of our technology deployed and operating,&#39;&#39; he said.

</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By The Associated Press</I></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE="+2">J</FONT>ACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Fred Fillah travels the country in search of hot markets for sports apparel. When 40,000 people filled the stadium at 1 a.m. to welcome the Jacksonville Jaguars, he knew he was in the right city.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This has got people whipped up in a frenzy,&#39;&#39; Fillah said Tuesday as Shirt Explosion was making new designs for a T-shirt. &#39;&#39;It scares me to think about what would happen if they win.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The first Jaguars&#39; shirt said, &#39;&#39;Do you believe in miracles?&#39;&#39; That one already sold out. The next design reads, &#39;&#39;We believe in miracles.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Jacksonville in the Super Bowl? Just getting to the AFC Championship game Sunday at New England has been a miracle in itself.
<P>    Two months ago, the Jaguars were 4-7 and looked like a team one year removed from expansion. There was talk of a championship team, all right, but it was directed 75 miles to the southwest at the University of Florida.
<P>    Sure enough, the Gators won their first national championship. But in Jacksonville, which has more Florida alumni than any other city in the state, that&#39;s already old news.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s crazy. You just can&#39;t believe it,&#39;&#39; said Keith Smith of Russ-Doe&#39;s Sandwich Shop, where the walls are adorned with Gator paraphernalia. &#39;&#39;Ninety-nine percent of the people, the minute they walk in the door it&#39;s either &#39;Go Jags,&#39; or &#39;How &#39;bout them Jags?&#39; &#39;&#39;
<P>    Shirts, caps, license plate frames and key rings started getting snatched up not long after Atlanta&#39;s Morten Andersen missed a chip-shot field goal that sent the Jaguars into the playoffs.
<P>    Then came the 30-27 victory at Buffalo, followed by another surprise, a 30-27 win at Denver.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Everything I can get my hands on goes out the door,&#39;&#39; said Dan Davis, manager of a Sports Authority sporting goods store. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ll tell you what Jacksonville is like, it&#39;s a zoo. If we beat the Patriots, all hell is going to break loose.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The sale of Jaguars&#39; merchandise ranked 21st among 30 NFL teams in March, the end of the fiscal year for NFL Properties.
<P>    &#39;&#39;They undoubtedly will move up,&#39;&#39; said Roger Atkin, vice president of retail sales for NFL Properties. He noted that the Patriots moved from 22nd to 11th in 1985, their Super Bowl season.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Obviously, there will be a big shot in the arm, depending on the success the club has in the remainder of the playoffs,&#39;&#39; Atkin said.
<P>    As the Jaguars&#39; charter plane approached Jacksonville late Saturday night, coach Tom Coughlin was told as many as 15,000 people were at the stadium. Nearly three times that many people let out a roar when their Boeing 757 tipped its left wing during a flyover of the stadium.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I couldn&#39;t believe it,&#39;&#39;  left tackle Tony Boselli said. &#39;&#39;I mean, it was after midnight and all those people were waiting for us.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Coughlin hadn&#39;t seen that kind of celebration since 1993, when his Boston College team returned home after an upset over then-No. 1 Notre Dame.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The same kind of electricity was in the air,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>    Three travel agencies offered one- and two-day packages to Foxboro, Mass., for Sunday&#39;s game starting at $699. All three were sold out in a day.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s been incredible. The phones have not stopped ringing,&#39;&#39; said Cyndi Wilkinson of Ferrell Travel and Limousine. 
<P>    Richard Brussard was among the estimated 40,000 who went to the stadium in the wee hours of the morning to meet the Jaguars. Some of them had just returned from New Orleans, where they watched Florida beat Florida State in the Sugar Bowl to win the national championship.
<P>    Most of them never dreamed of a chance to return to New Orleans for the Super Bowl.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s almost too much for everybody to handle,&#39;&#39; Brussard said. &#39;&#39;Our cup runneth over.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The city runneth wild.

        <p><font size="5">T</font>he first winter storm of 1997
        is expected to arrive in Knoxville and surrounding East
        Tennessee counties this evening and bring freezing rain
        or sleet and a drastic drop in temperatures. </p>
        <p>Forecasts call for what ''very well could be a major
        event,'' according to Mike Propst of the National Weather
        Service's Morristown station. </p>
        <p>''It's likely to hit Southeast Tennessee around
        midday, and it'll move this way, into the Knoxville area,
        by early evening,'' Propst said. </p>
        <p>''We're expecting plenty of cold air in place and one
        to two inches of precipitation in the form of rain, but
        there's likely to be plenty of warm air overriding the
        cold air, which means we're leaning toward a freezing
        rain situation with sleet possible.'' </p>
        <p>The anticipated storm will be part of the same system
        that began moving across Texas and Louisiana earlier this
        week, Propst said. The leading edge of the storm was
        expected to begin falling Tuesday night on Memphis. </p>
        <p>''If we don't get those little balls of ice called
        sleet, we're looking at liquid precipitation getting
        supercooled as it falls so that it freezes on contact
        with the ground,'' Propst said. ''That, of course, is the
        worst-case scenario for roads and powerlines.'' </p>
        <p>Lt. Steve Hodge of the Tennessee Highway Patrol's
        Knoxville station said troopers anticipate long shifts. </p>
        <p>''I'm sure we're going to have people caught out in it
        and having accidents,'' Hodge said. </p>
        <p>''Of course, my best advice would be not getting out
        unless absolutely necessary, driving at safe speeds and
        keeping in mind that bridges and overpasses can surprise
        you with sudden ice on an otherwise-passable road.'' </p>
        <p>While the clearing of interstate highways is a
        priority for state Department of Transportation crews,
        Hodge said, ''sometimes even the DOT can't stay ahead of
        Mother Nature.'' </p>
        <p>In anticipation of the storm, area residents were
        busily stockpiling groceries Tuesday. </p>
        <p>''We've been very, very, very busy,'' said Angela
        Crowell, assistant manager of West Knoxville's Kroger
        Marketplace. ''The major concern seemed to start (Monday)
        with bread and milk, people looking for the perishables
        you can't overload on until the last minute. </p>
        <p>''Dairy, bread and produce always get cleaned out, and
        we're still trying to adjust from getting over the
        holidays. We've got a huge truckload of produce coming
        (this) morning.'' </p>
        <p>Get supplies to last through the weekend, advised
        Propst, who said ''definitely cold'' temperatures will
        ensure that conditions wrought by the storm are
        relatively long-lasting. </p>
        <p>''It's going to be cold and getting colder,'' Propst
        said, ''and we're looking at the chance of snow Thursday
        and Friday.'' </p>
        <p>Despite predictions of a sunny day, Saturday's
        temperatures -- from lows in the lower teens -- aren't
        expected to exceed the 20s. </p>
        <p>Today's temperatures are expected to range from the
        upper 20s to a high in the mid-30s. </p>

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Student, already expelled, facing day in court</B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Father is upset by charge</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he father of a Powell High School student expelled last month because a knife was found in his car is upset that school officials now are taking the boy to Juvenile Court.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They pronounced the sentence (of expulsion) before they had the hearing,&#39;&#39; said Dennis Seal, whose son, Dustin, 17, is charged with delinquency. &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t understand it. I don&#39;t see how in America it can be done.&#39;&#39;
<P>   School officials said expulsion and juvenile charges are separate issues.
<P>   The school board almost automatically expels students caught with weapons under its &#39;&#39;zero tolerance&#39;&#39; policy.
<P>   When an incident also fits state law parameters -- because of the type of weapon or a student&#39;s &#39;&#39;intent to go armed&#39;&#39; -- juvenile charges are filed.
<P>   &#39;&#39;That&#39;s the law,&#39;&#39; Assistant Superintendent Roy Mullins said. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s not a principal decision or a security decision. If they violate the law, they&#39;re going to be charged in juvenile court for violating the law, and then the court runs its course.&#39;&#39;
<P>   According to the county Law Department, principals must report weapons violations to law enforcement officials.
<P>   Said the schools&#39; security chief, Steve Griffin: &#39;&#39;Any time we get a weapon any more we go to the attorney general&#39;s office. We show them the weapon, we lay the case out for them and ultimately they make the decision whether to prosecute or not.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Overall, the goal is to keep weapons out of school. While a student might not intend to use a knife for violence, students with violent motives might take it, so it can&#39;t be allowed at all, Superintendent Allen Morgan said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Our top priority is insuring that youngsters who go to school and teachers who go to school every day will be involved in a positive learning and teaching environment, absent of violence or threats of violence,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   In 16 weapons incidents this school year there have been 13 expulsions, and school officials said most incidents are taken to court, too, although they couldn&#39;t give an exact number Tuesday.
<P>   A Juvenile Court case can go on much longer than the one-year school expulsion.
<P>   Whitney Davidson -- expelled from West High School last year after carrying a trick cane with a sword from her car into Powell Middle School to return it to its owner -- is eligible to re-enter school Jan. 24, the same day her case goes to Juvenile Court.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t think I should be guilty. I think I&#39;ve been punished enough,&#39;&#39; the 17-year-old said.
<P>   Her father, lawyer Bill Davidson, plans a court fight.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There&#39;s a cloud over her right now,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;She&#39;s still facing a punishment if she&#39;s found guilty . . . and these (juvenile charges) are so serious that they can require incarceration.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Delinquents can be assigned to community service, ordered to pay court costs, lose driving privileges or be sent to a youth facility.
<P>   In the Seal case, lawyer Tommy K. Hindman said he&#39;s &#39;&#39;certain&#39;&#39; of Seal&#39;s innocence and that the case should have been tried before Seal&#39;s expulsion. A court date hasn&#39;t been set.
<P>   &#39;&#39;After a hearing with rules of evidence in front of a judge, as society presumes is the constitutional way to do things, if the judge finds him guilty, so be it. The manner in which (school officials are) handling the zero-tolerance cases simply does not protect a students&#39; rights.&#39;&#39;

        <p><font size="5">G</font>entle hills, once part of the
        Little Creek Sanitarium property, gradually are coming to
        life with families who are new residents of the 500-home
        Whittington Creek residential development. </p>
        <p>Homeowners there, but for some meticulous planning,
        might well feel ''swallowed up'' by the mere scale of
        Whittington Creek, a Knoxville community off Northshore
        Drive where 125 homes are built or under way. </p>
        <p>But Knoxville developer Bryan E. Testerman, who
        supervises subdivision construction, saw that one coming.
        He's made plans<b> &127;</b>to preserve neighborhood
        intimacy on the 300-acre property near Bluegrass and
        Rocky Hill communities. </p>
        <p>In the 40 years that his family's firm, Ben Testerman
        Construction Co., has built area homes, Bryan Testerman
        has learned that such ''grand scale'' can compromise a
        sense of ''neighborhood'' so important to families. So
        Whittington Creek, atop rolling hills east of Ebenezer
        Road, was planned in seven neighborhoods of more modest
        size. </p>
        <p>That, Testerman says, sets apart this development from
        similar residential construction. </p>
        <p>''You see that done a lot in Atlanta and in Florida
        developments,'' Testerman said of the ''neighborhood
        within a neighborhood'' concept. ''But so far as I know,
        it's the first time it's been used here.'' </p>
        <p>Testerman said the horseshoe-drives -- often within
        sight of the Smoky Mountains -- make residents feel
        they're part of a less expansive community. </p>
        <p>''Each neighborhood has one way in, one way out,''
        said the developer whose company is observing its 40th
        anniversary. </p>
        <p>''No homes face on our boulevard,'' Testerman said.
        ''Its only purpose is access to the neighborhoods.'' He
        added: </p>
        <p>''We wanted to design neighborhoods attractive to
        families and ideal for children -- playground, broad
        sidewalks, ample street lighting, all amenities.'' </p>
        <p>Whittington Creek, two miles east of the Pellissippi
        Parkway, is just off the 8800 block of Northshore Drive,
        15 minutes from McGhee Tyson Airport and 20 minutes from
        downtown. </p>
        <p>The Testermans began in 1990 negotiating with the
        Seventh Day Adventist Church which owned the 330-acre
        property, 30 acres of which the sanitarium has kept for
        its 30-bed nursing home. A school, once on the property,
        has moved to Crossville. </p>
        <p>Testerman and his brother-partner, John W. Testerman
        Sr., bought the land in February 1994 for $5.5 million.
        They since have developed Hemingway Grove and Isherwood
        Trail neighborhoods, to be completed by 1999. </p>
        <p>The next three developed will be Tennyson Manor,
        Dickinson Lane and Emerson Park. Five builders are
        building the homes, most ranging from 2,600 to 3,000
        square feet. </p>
        <p>''By the time the development is completed in a
        decade,'' Testerman said, ''some homes may have 7,000
        square feet or more.'' All are custom-designed, situated
        on 32 to 100 lots in each neighborhood. </p>
        <p>Hemingway Grove, with its underground utilities,
        features 110 homes priced from $350,000 to $500,000. So
        far, 40 homes are occupied and 85 others are under
        construction. </p>
        <p>The 32 Isherwood Trail properties offer floor plans
        for homebuyers whose price range begins near $289,900. </p>
        <p>All have access to community recreational facilities
        including a 25-meter swimming pool and mile-long jogging
        trail. The amenity center features tennis, basketball and
        volleyball courts, a pool and other facilities. </p>
        <p>The Metropolitan Planning Commission awarded the
        Testerman firm a 1996 ''excellence award'' for
        Whittington Creek plans. The Greater Knoxville
        Beautification Board presented the firm its 1996 Orchid
        Award recognizing the community's attractive signs and
        landscaping. Utilities construction is by Upgrades Inc.
        Ragan-Smith provides engineering and landscaping. </p>
        <p>The Testerman firm, long a Tennessee Valley Home
        Builders Association member, has built homes on more than
        2,000 residential acres since the mid-1950s. </p>
        <p>The Testermans' legacy includes seven residential
        developments, five apartment complexes, a golf course and
        5,000 homes in the Andover, Bennington, Westmoreland
        Hills, St. Ives, Farmington, Farrington, Hamilton Place
        and Braddock's Place subdivisions. </p>

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Moves give Marlin more shots at Daytona</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Bill Luther, News-Sentinel sportswriter</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT>ORT WORTH -- Two-time Daytona 500 winner Sterling Marlin is in position with McClure Racing for five more shots at the Crown Jewel event.
<P>    There are three good reasons:
<P>    * Larry McClure revealed during a conference call --  while the NASCAR media tour was getting a first-hand look at the new Texas Motor Speedway on Tuesday -- that Marlin&#39;s contract has been extended five years to the 2001 season.
<P>    * Eastman Kodak has reached an agreement with the Abingdon, Va., Winston Cup team to continue as the corporate sponsor through the year 2000.
<P>    * Veteran Tim Brewer, who left the Kranefuss/Haas Ford team before the conclusion of the 1996 season, has joined the McClure team as crew chief.
<P>    Marlin has been with McClure the last three years and came up short of a record third consecutive Daytona 500 wins last February.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I&#39;m happy with the success I&#39;ve had with this team,&#39;&#39; said Marlin, who got his initial victory in his first outing with McClure in the 1994 opener. &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve won six races.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Brewer replaces Tony Glover, who was lured away by owner Felix Sabates with three races left on the 1996 schedule.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It (losing Tony) shocked me a little bit,&#39;&#39; Marlin said. &#39;&#39;Sometimes such things are good for a team, but it can be difficult at times. Some have asked if we can do it (win back-to-back 500s) again. Yes, we probably can. We have a great bunch of guys and have been a good team. I&#39;m excited about Tim (Marlin&#39;s crew chief while driving for Junior Johnson in 1991-92). He likes to win and that&#39;s what I like to do.&#39;&#39;
<P>    McClure, the team owner for 14 years, was excited.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I&#39;m really happy with the team we have put together,&#39;&#39; McClure said. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re going to put Tim back in Victory Lane in a Monte Carlo. His last start in a Chevrolet was the Atlanta 500 in 1988, then he switched to Ford.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Tim has a lot of experience and knowledge. He&#39;s aggressive and sizes up what it takes to win. He doesn&#39;t want to run second.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Brewer checked on possible jobs with Robert Yates Racing, Hendrick Motorsports and Richard Childress Racing before agreeing to McClure&#39;s offer.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I talked with those owners and several Busch drivers,&#39;&#39; Brewer said. &#39;&#39;I talked with some about the Super Truck series and had talks with Sterling. Later Sterling ask me to join the team, and he beat out Yates and (Dale) Earnhardt (Childress&#39; driver).&#39;&#39;
<P>    Naturally, McClure played the key role in the search.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Larry and I sat on pit road several times to work out strategy (through the years),&#39;&#39; Brewer said. &#39;&#39;We butted heads a few times, but this is an exciting team for the future.&#39;&#39;
<P>    <B>AHEAD IN &#39;98?:</B> Through most of the 1996 season McClure talked about fielding a second team.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We scrapped that idea for this year,&#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;but we&#39;ll look at it for next season. A lot will depend on NASCAR&#39;s testing rules.&#39;&#39;
<P>    <B>ON TARGET: </B>The McClure Racing Museum, which is under construction just off I-81 in Abingdon, is expected to be completed by May -- weather pemitting.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The research and development work will continue to be done in the old shop,&#39;&#39; McClure said. &#39;&#39;The museum will be in the new facility. And, I want people to know there will be things in the museum that haven&#39;t been a part of McClure Racing.&#39;&#39;

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Interest in serving on Election Commission up after recent foul-up</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Michael Silence, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he &#39;&#39;unification fiasco&#39;&#39; has led to a healthy interest in serving on the Knox County Election Commission, said the Republican state legislator leading the selection process for a new member.
<P>   Rep. Jim Boyer, R-Corryton, said as of Monday afternoon he knew of three &#39;&#39;serious&#39;&#39; candidates for the job -- a high school principal, a high school librarian and a Halls businessman. 
<P>   All three said they are interested in replacing the late Hazel Showalter, who died last month. They are Donna Wright, principal at West High School; Rebecca Longmire, a librarian at Gibbs High School; and John Tindell, a businessman who unsuccessfully challenged Knox County Commissioner Leo Cooper in 1990. Tindell, active in the Halls Republican Club, was Halls campaign manager for Boyer in Boyer&#39;s first successful campaign for the state House and is currently a member of the Knox County Republican Executive Committee.
<P>   Boyer said there may be more interested, but as of Monday afternoon he had only confirmed Wright, Longmire and Tindell.
<P>   State Sen. Ben Atchley, R-Knoxville, will be one of seven of the Knox County Republican delegation who will be voting Saturday to recommend to the State Election Commission a replacement for Showalter.
<P>   The other six voting will be Boyer, who has coordinated the replacement effort; Reps. Tim Burchett, Bill Dunn and H.E. Bittle; and Sens. Bud Gilbert and Randy McNally. Although McNally lives in Oak Ridge, part of his district includes a portion of Northwest Knox County.
<P>   Atchley said the nominee will come from North or Northeast Knox County. All three mentioned by Boyer live in those areas. Atchley said it has been several years since North Knox County has been represented on the commission and several of the legislative delegation believe it is time for that part of the county to have a member on the commission.
<P>   Boyer said the State Election Commission meets Jan. 14 and is expected at that time to appoint the new member.
<P>   Boyer said the foul-up with early votes in November&#39;s referendum on whether to unify Knoxville/Knox County governments has increased interest in serving on the commission. The Election Commission office could not separate city and county votes in early voting. That was necessary because the measure, which failed anyway, would have had to have passed in the city and the county in order to take affect. Registrar-at-large Irene Lovely has accepted responsibility for that foul-up.
<P>   He also said generally there is an increased political awareness and more people are interested in participating in the process. That awareness was heightened, too, by the publicity over the unification foul-up.

<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">R</FONT>ecent decisions by the Federal Aviation Administration to limit sightseeing flights in the Grand Canyon and Rocky Mountain national parks will not immediately affect the number of helicopter sightseeing flights over the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the park&#39;s aviation coordinator said Monday.
<P>    Bob Whiteman said ideally the Smokies would like to see an end to all sightseeing flights over the park.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen,&#39;&#39; Whiteman said. &#39;&#39;The (park service) experience so far is once there&#39;s an operation established, its very difficult to prevent. Basically we look now at compromises.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Instead of seeking specific overflight rules in the Smokies, Whiteman has been working closely with a team of National Park Service and FAA officials trying to develop a general policy applicable to all national parks.
<P>    Following the example of the Grand Canyon, Whiteman said he hopes to see rules that will eventually limit sightseeing flights to specific corridors and restrict the times of overflights as well as providing incentives for low-noise aircraft.
<P>    Three helicopter companies, two in Pigeon Forge and a third in Wears Valley, offer regular flights into the park. Whiteman estimates roughly 4,000 such flights each year.
<P>    That&#39;s far less than at the Grand Canyon, where sightseeing flights were approaching 100,000 a year in 1996, spurring the decision to pass immediate restrictions.

        <font size="5"><br>
        Transportation equipment manufacturing strong for ET</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Jerry Dean, News-Sentinel
        business writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">A</font> report from the Federal Reserve
        Bank of Atlanta predicts Tennessee will have ''a good but
        unspectacular'' business climate in 1997. </p>
        <p>Dr. Tom Cunningham, the economist who prepared the
        report, said East Tennessee would do well to quit trying
        to outpace other regions that boast air transportation
        hubs and focus instead on its other transportation
        assets. </p>
        <p>East Tennessee, he said, may better focus on such
        industries as auto parts manufacturing that produce
        heavier goods. They are more likely to place value on the
        city's locale as a road-rail-river transportation center.
        </p>
        <p>A relatively rosy 1997 state economic outlook,
        according to statistics prepared for the bank by
        Cunningham's Regional Financial Associates, is reflected
        in recent capital investment statistics. State Economic
        and Community Development Department researchers reported
        $1.4 billion invested the first half of 1996 in new and
        expanded businesses -- 49 percent more than in the
        comparable period of 1995. </p>
        <p>The report, which covers Federal Reserve District 6
        (Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and
        Mississippi) said, despite such investments, that lack of
        available labor held Tennessee's 1996 job growth near
        Southeast regional averages. Labor shortages, it said,
        also mean Middle Tennessee no longer enjoys job growth
        rates double that of the national average. </p>
        <p>The state's 6.4 percent jobless rate from 1992
        declined to 5.8 percent in 1993 and 5.2 percent in 1995.
        Such a tight labor market, Cunningham said, is ''not
        necessarily bad,'' since it applies brakes to runaway
        economic growth. </p>
        <p>Tennesseans' 1997 personal income, the study predicts,
        will continue ''very robust'' growth that saw a 1992 rise
        of 9 percent and 7 percent rises in 1994 and 1995. A
        healthy service sector, powered by tourism, will boost
        the economy, with a ''rise in high-paying auto-related
        manufacturing jobs.'' </p>
        <p>Cunningham said local tourism, ''while growing in
        absolute size,'' has less overall impact on the region's
        economy than do major metal and chemical producers like
        those at Alcoa. The study, however, said Tennessee
        lodging business grew 7.6 percent in 1996, as other
        recreation grew by 3.4 percent. </p>
        <p>Cunningham noted recent cutbacks at TVA, Oak Ridge
        facilities, the University of Tennessee and in the Great
        Smoky Mountains National Park -- mainstays of East
        Tennessee's economy. </p>
        <p>But he said: ''In the long run, those can be pretty
        good'' for the economy if they mean more efficient
        operations. ''Cutbacks are inevitable,'' Cunningham
        added. ''Question is, how do you take the hit? </p>
        <p>''You've done a good job so far,'' he added, noting
        how many professionals have found other work. </p>
        <p>Most state economic weakness, the study showed, was in
        apparel manufacturing, an industry that declined 15
        percent in 1996. </p>
        <p>Cunningham said that weakness will continue in 1997.
        Printing and publishing, including Nashville's music and
        religious publishing, also was flat in 1996, and
        Cunningham sees no 1997 catalyst to jump-start it. </p>
        <p>But transportation equipment manufacturing in 1996 was
        up 3.9 percent over 1995, the study noted, with Nissan
        and Saturn both expanding. Industrial machinery and other
        durables kept high employment in 1996; and lumber and
        wood industries added employees to handle construction
        demand. </p>
        <p>The study predicted transportation equipment
        manufacturing will remain a healthy industry as new
        plants and suppliers locate here. But its presence also
        may leave Tennessee vulnerable to cyclical downturns in
        the auto industry. </p>
        <p>Tennessee exports, the report said, are dominated by
        chemical and paper products, bound for Europe and Japan,
        and by transportation equipment, industrial machinery and
        computers headed to Canada and Mexico. Shipment of Saturn
        cars and auto parts to Europe and Japan should add
        visibility to other state industries and thus yield more
        1997 jobs. </p>
        <p>''With your good energy base and work force in
        place,'' Cunningham said, East Tennessee ''should be in
        good position to supply an automotive parts market as the
        world thinks more about making cars in North America.''
        An Australian auto parts manufacturer, he noted, recently
        announced a new Knoxville plant. </p>
        <p>But he said East Tennessee should spend less time
        seeking to lure industries that require ready air access,
        and should focus more on those heavily dependent on rail
        and truck transit. ''Better air service never hurts,'' he
        said. ''But a central location for handling freight can
        be just as important.'' The study said: </p>
        <p>* One in four Tennesseans is employed in services
        where jobs rose 3 percent from 1995 to 1996. </p>
        <p>* Health services jobs grew 1.5 percent here in 1996. </p>
        <p>* Tennessee retail growth rates in 1996 outpaced those
        of the nation; but the report predicted only ''moderate''
        overall retail sales growth in 1997. </p>
        <p>* Growth in 1996 durable goods and auto sales
        reflected ''extremely high'' growth rates. </p>
        <p>The report said Nashville, with its popular Opryland
        theme park expansion, will stay a regional tourism focus.
        But Cunningham said Gatlinburg and Sevier County
        attractions are likely to draw more visitors from a
        Nashville-Myrtle Beach, S.C., tourist corridor. </p>
        <p>The report also noted growth in Knoxville building
        permits, echoing state trends with a second-quarter 1996
        peak. Construction statewide, the report predicted, may
        slow in early 1997 -- then reflect moderate growth. But
        Tennessee agriculture should brace for ''a sluggish
        year,'' the report concluded. </p>

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Cherokees&#39; top scorer is traded</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Nick Gates, News-Sentinel sportswriter</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">H</FONT>igh-scoring Kyle Reeves, who was on pace to break Knoxville&#39;s single-season goal-scoring record, has -- as expected -- played his final game with the Cherokees.
<P>    Reeves, and a player yet to be named, were traded Monday by coach and director of hockey operations Barry Smith to the Jacksonville Lizard Kings for defenseman Tobias Ablad and forward Francois Leroux.
<P>    All involved in the East Coast Hockey League deal had to agree to report to their respective teams to consummate the transaction.
<P>    Jacksonville, which is en route to Louisville where the Lizard Kings play Wednesday, conveniently stopped in Knoxville on Monday night and the players might work out with their new teams today. The Cherokees play the Columbus Chill, the North Division leader, tonight at 7 at Civic Coliseum.
<P>    Reeves, a second-round draft pick of the St. Louis Blues in 1991, had 29 goals in 31 games with the Cherokees and led the team in scoring. His 51 points are three behind league-leader Mike Ross of South Carolina.
<P>    The right winger was an offensive weapon. He led Knoxville with power-play goals (eight), shorthanded goals (three) and game-winners (five). He was a minus-3. Only Stan Drulia, who scored 63 goals for Knoxville in 1990-91, has turned on the red light with more frquency.
<P>    But Reeves fell out of favor with Smith as the Cherokees (12-18-1) sank deeper into the Eastern Division cellar. Knoxville has won only one of its last 12 games.
<P>    Their troubles came to a boil during the first period of a 5-2 loss to the Roanoke Express on Saturday night at the Civic Coliseum. Heated words were exchanged on the bench. Reeves changed into street clothes during the first intermission and left the arena.
<P>    Reeves was not at practice Monday, but met with Smith behind closed doors after the workout in an attempt to resolve their differences. He did not request the trade.
<P>    According to Smith, Reeves refused a media requests to discuss his imminent departure. Reeves asked the Cherokees not give out his phone number, which is unlisted.
<P>    If Reeves doesn&#39;t report, he&#39;ll likley be suspended.
<P>    The trade wasn&#39;t done in haste. Jacksonville had approached Smith about Reeves&#39; availability.
<P>    Ablad, a rookie, has five goals, 14 assists and 18 penalty minutes for the Lizard Kings (9-16-5), who are in last place in the South. He has played in all 30 of their games.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The defenseman is in the running for the all-star team,&#39;&#39; Smith said.
<P>    Leroux scored six goals and 14 assists in 21 games last season with the Lizard Kings, who reached the Riley Cup finals. He has only three goals in 28 games in 1996-97.
<P>    &#39;&#39;He doesn&#39;t have big numbers,&#39;&#39; Smith acknowledged. &#39;&#39;He had better numbers last season.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Offense hasn&#39;t been Knoxville&#39;s trouble. The Cherokees have allowed league-high 170 goals and the goaltending has been shaky. They haven&#39;t always been as physical as their foes.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Leroux is a guy I really think we need in the sense that he forechecks hard and hits real hard,&#39;&#39; Smith said. &#39;&#39;I like that.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Unlike Leroux, Smith hasn&#39;t seen Ablad play, but scouting reports are favorable.
<P>    &#39;&#39;His stats are pretty good and he&#39;s a power-play guy on the point,&#39;&#39; Smith said. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve talked to some other teams about him.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Players had mixed emotions as they waited for the spat to be resolved.
<P>    &#39;&#39;He&#39;s a great goal scorer,&#39;&#39; captain Wayne Anchikoski, who is on injured reserve, said of Reeves. &#39;&#39;I&#39;m not sure what Barry&#39;s point of view was, but maybe he thought Kyle was a liability out there. That&#39;s what Kyle thinks and we&#39;ve talked.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Said forward Matt Turek: &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen, but he&#39;s the second-leading scorer in the league. I&#39;d like for him to be here. He&#39;s a good guy and a great player.
<P>    For coach&#39;s sake if that&#39;s not possible, we need to get on with our season.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Said Anchikoski: &#39;&#39;We&#39;ll work hard and get over it.&#39;&#39;
<P>    It&#39;s players like Turek, who has four goals, who must take up the slack.
<P>    &#39;&#39;For myself and our line -- Dean (Moore) and Martin (Tanguay) -- we all have some offensive abilities,&#39;&#39; Turek said. &#39;&#39;We should try to take advantage of that now that we need to step up.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The shake-up has sent one clear-cut message to the players: There are no sacred cows and there is no doubt as to who is running the operation.
<P>

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Wider highways will give economic boost to towns, officials say</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Stan DeLozier, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>idening U.S. Highways 27 and 411, two of East Tennessee&#39;s main north-south arteries, will be an economic pep pill for small towns along the routes, officials say.
<P>   By the end of 1997, the state Department of Transportation says about half of the 75 miles of Highway 27 between Rockwood and Chattanooga will have four lanes.
<P>   Work to widen U.S. 411 between Maryville and Polk County to four lanes is not as far along. However, the state says three new segments along the route that also total 75 miles are scheduled to open in the next year.
<P>   &#39;&#39;This will be a shot in the arm for us economically,&#39;&#39; said John Solsbee, city manager of Etowah, a town of about nearly 4,000 in McMinn County. &#39;&#39;Not only will it bring development, hopefully there will be an increase in tourism that will bring motels, restaurants, service stations and other commercial development.&#39;&#39;
<P>   All of that will bring Etowah more sales tax revenue, Solsbee pointed out. In addition, the town should pick up more business from travelers who are just passing through, he said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The traffic volume should increase, especially when the route is four-laned from one end to the other,&#39;&#39; Solsbee said. &#39;&#39;The route between Knoxville and Atlanta is 45 miles shorter than it is by interstate.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Nearly two miles of Highway 411 through Etowah has had four lanes for several years, but by mid-summer, a 4.5-mile stretch from the south city limits to Chestuee Creek is expected to be opened.
<P>   John Landreth, a city commissioner and former mayor of Spring City in Rhea County along U.S. 27, sounded a theme similar to Solsbee&#39;s.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There will be good and bad with the four-laning,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;The good is that there will be more traffic through Rhea County and we hope that Spring City will pick up more business as a result.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The bad is that we will have to hire more policemen. Also, there will be the construction all through the middle of town, but that will only be a temporary inconvenience.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Highway 411 runs from Greeneville, Tenn., south to near Cartersville, Ga., where many travelers hit I-75 to go to Atlanta. At Cartersville, Highway 411 turns west and goes to the Birmingham area. Highway 27 connects Miami with Sault Saint Marie, Mich., on the Canadian border.
<P>   At one time, both highways were heavily used by the trucking industry, but that changed with the advent of the interstate highway system. Truckers that once passed through East Tennessee on Highway 411 or 27 now take Interstate 75.
<P>   Landreth says things are bound to change when the widening projects are complete.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We hope there will be new industry that will locate in Rhea County,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Most of what is shipped is on the highway and industry will locate where trucks can travel.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;ll have a lot better transportation system,&#39;&#39; Solsbee said. &#39;&#39;It will put small towns along 411 on a more equal plane with the towns along the interstate in terms of being able to attract industry and commercial development.&#39;&#39;
<P>   In Maryville, however, Assistant City Manager Roger Campbell sees it a little differently.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think there will be more residential development in Blount County along 411,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;It will bring more population to a county which already has been growing at about 10 percent per year.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The increased population will bring more sales tax revenue, and Campbell said the city&#39;s trading area, which now draws from Monroe and Loudon counties, will grow.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think it will stretch a little farther south,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We already draw people from Madisonville, but I expect Maryville will become more of a regional center.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Although city and county officials talk about Highway 411 having four lanes &#39;&#39;all the way to Georgia,&#39;&#39; there are some hitches.
<P>   State DOT spokeswoman Luanne Grandinetti said there are no current plans to four-lane the route along a 10-mile section from U.S. Highway 64 in Polk County to the state line. She said two lanes are adequate to carry the traffic presently.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Making that portion four lanes is something I&#39;m sure will be considered in the future,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s probably in some long-range plan.&#39;&#39;
<P>   In Englewood, a final decision on a route has not been made because some of the town&#39;s residents want the four-lane stretch built through town. Others want a bypass.
<P>   A 5.3-mile stretch north of Benton in Polk County is part of a highway improvement program devised during Gov. Lamar Alexander&#39;s administration in the 1980s.
<P>   The status of four-lane construction on 411 traveling from Maryville south to the state line:
<P>   * Maryville near Montgomery Lane to Springview Road in Blount County, 6.6 miles, estimated completion in November 1997, cost $11.7 million.
<P>   * Springview Road to Highway 95 in Loudon County, 4.4 miles, right of way is being purchased, a spring bid letting is expected.
<P>   * Highway 95 to Tellico Lake, 3.7 miles, right-of-way being bought, the earliest bid letting date is in October 1997.
<P>   * Bridge over Tellico Lake and approaches is complete, 1.9 miles.
<P>   * South side of Tellico Lake, through Vonore to Highway 72 west, 3.3 miles, estimated completion is mid-summer 1997, cost $6.3 million.
<P>   * Highway 72 west to Madisonville Bypass, 5.5 miles, right-of-way purchase is under way, earliest bid letting is June 1998.
<P>   * The 2.1-mile Madisonville Bypass is complete.
<P>   * South end of the bypass to the Monroe-McMinn County line, 5.1 miles, engineering is under way.
<P>   * County line to south city limits of Englewood at Chestuee Creek, 4.8 miles, construction awaits a decision on whether to build a bypass or follow the current route through town.
<P>   * Englewood to Etowah, 4.5 miles, completion expected in mid-summer 1997, cost $9 million.
<P>   * A 1.9-mile, four-lane highway exists through Etowah.
<P>   * Etowah to the McMinn-Polk County line, 3.8 miles, engineering is under way.
<P>   * The county line to State Route 30, 3 miles, right-of-way purchase to begin in 1997.
<P>   * State Route 30 to Benton, 5.3 miles, part of a 13-year, statewide 1986 highway improvement plan that is unfunded.
<P>   * North to south through Benton, 1.6 miles, low bid of $3.7 million submitted by Highways Inc. of Brentwood, completion in 1999.
<P>   * Benton to U.S. Highway 64, 5.2 miles, engineering is under way.
<P>   * U.S. 64 to Tennessee-Georgia line is not in present plans for four-laning.
<P>   The status of construction on Highway 27 from I-40 in Roane County to Chattanooga:
<P>   * The highway has four lanes from I-40 to just south of Rockwood, distance 4.9 miles.
<P>   * Rockwood to Roane-Rhea County line at Whites Creek, 4.5 miles, completion date is May 1997, cost $7.3 million.
<P>   * Bridge over White&#39;s Creek and approaches have four lanes, .7 mile.
<P>   * White&#39;s Creek to Macedina Road in Rhea County, 4.3 miles, completion expected in May 1998, cost $7.3 million.
<P>   * Macedina Road to Spring City, 4 miles, expected to be completed in June 1997, cost $7.6 million.
<P>   * North limits of Spring City to State Route 68, 3.8 miles, right-of-way purchase will begin in 1997.
<P>   * State Route 68 to Boffer Road in Rhea County, 5.5 miles, engineering is under way.
<P>   * Boffer Road to Dayton, 7.6 miles, right-of way purchase to begin in 1997.
<P>   * Dayton to Chattanooga has four lanes.

<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Marti Davis, News-Sentinel staff
        writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">F</font>at bears and a bumper crop of wild
        pigs -- that's what officials at the Great Smoky
        Mountains National Park are expecting as a result of two
        weeks of unseasonably warm weather. </p>
        <p>While female bears went into semihibernation several
        weeks ago and are likely to stay in their dens, male
        bears have still been spotted roaming the forests,
        fattening up on the especially good crop of acorns that
        dropped during the autumn months, said park spokesman Bob
        Miller. </p>
        <p>The park's only real concern with the warm weather,
        however, concerns its wild boar population inside the
        park, which is likely to grow, Miller said. ''Piglets are
        born generally in January. If there's a lot of snow,
        nature will take a toll on those little piglets that are
        born in the coldest month of the year,'' he said. </p>
        <p>With the warm temperatures and lack of snow, more
        piglets will survive this year, he predicted. That's a
        hard blow for the park's wildlife managers, who have
        aggressively been trying to reduce the number of wild
        hogs in the park in recent years. </p>
        <p>''We used to say we had 1,000 to 2,000 hogs. After
        years of pretty aggressive hog reductions, we've started
        saying 500 to 600,'' Miller said. </p>
        <p>Some of the actions taken to reduce the population of
        wild boar in the park include the introduction of red
        wolves, which are believed to feed on wild piglets. In
        addition to this natural measure, the park has hired
        professional hunters to kill off as many of the hogs as
        possible. </p>
        <p>Wild boar are not native to the park but were
        introduced into the area from central Europe by sportsmen
        who wanted to hunt the elusive creatures. The boar soon
        wandered beyond the hunting preserves and into protected
        areas. </p>
        <p>Their persistent rooting has had a heavy impact on
        plant populations in some areas within the park, Miller
        said. The boar also compete with native species, like the
        black bear, for acorns and other natural plant food
        sources. </p>
        <p>Janet Rock, a park plant specialist, said she does not
        expect native plant species to be affected by the warm
        spell. </p>

        <font size="5">T</font>he Carolina Panthers put an
        exclamation point on the NFL's changing of the guard
        Sunday. </p>
        <p>They knocked Super Bowl champion Dallas from the
        playoffs with a 26-17 victory and joined their expansion
        brethren from Jacksonville in the conference
        championships. The Cowboys, San Francisco, Denver and AFC
        champion Pittsburgh will have to be content to sit home
        and watch. </p>
        <p>The Panthers head to Green Bay for the NFC title game
        Sunday. </p>
        <p>''I wouldn't count this team out. Every time we've had
        a challenge this year we've responded,'' said coach Dom
        Capers. </p>
        <p>John Kasay kicked four field goals, Kerry Collins
        threw two touchdown passes and Anthony Johnson ran for
        104 yards. Just as important was a defense, led by the
        venerable Sam Mills, that intercepted Troy Aikman three
        times, and three times held Dallas to a field goal after
        the Cowboys moved inside the 5. </p>
        <p>For the Cowboys, their quest for a record fourth Super
        Bowl in five years ended the way it began -- without
        Michael Irvin. </p>
        <p>Irvin, suspended for the first five games after
        pleading no contest to cocaine possession, broke his
        right collarbone on Dallas' second offensive play and
        missed the rest of the game. </p>
        <p>They also lost Deion Sanders late with a head injury
        when he was tackled after getting a first down on a
        reverse. He was one of the players who replaced Irvin. </p>
        <p>This game was typical of Dallas' season, which ended
        11-7. The offense just couldn't get a touchdown when it
        needed one, particularly without Irvin. </p>
        <p>''You've got to get the ball in the end zone and we
        just haven't done it,'' Dallas coach Barry Switzer said. </p>
        <p>The outcome means two of the final four teams are just
        two years old -- the Panthers and Jacksonville, which
        will play at New England in the AFC title game. </p>
        <p>Dallas' scoring problems showed early. </p>
        <p>After Irvin was hurt on a 22-yard reception when he
        was hit by Lamar Lathon, the Cowboys drove to a first
        down at the Carolina 3. </p>
        <p>But as has happened so often this season, they
        couldn't get the ball in the end zone. Mills stopped
        Emmitt Smith on third down, and the Cowboys had to settle
        for Chris Boniol's 22-yard field goal and a 3-0 lead. </p>
        <p>Carolina (13-4) scored on its next two possessions,
        Collins throwing a 1-yard TD pass to Wesley Walls on a
        68-yard, six-play drive, then capping a 42-yard, 11-play
        drive with 9-yard pass to Willie Green. </p>
        <p>But the key might have come on the first series of the
        second half after the Cowboys, down 17-11, recovered
        Winslow Oliver's fumbled punt return at the Carolina 17.
        Dallas reached the 5, but the 37-year-old Mills stopped
        Smith on second down when he appeared to have a hole, and
        Dallas settled again for a field goal by Boniol. </p>
        <p>Carolina retaliated with Kasay's 40-yard field goal,
        and then the defense took over -- as it has so often in a
        season in which the Panthers have gone 9-0 at Ericsson
        Stadium and allowed just one second-half touchdown at
        home. </p>
        <p>Kasay added another 40-yarder three minutes into the
        fourth quarter. </p>
        <p>Mills was all over the field -- stuffing runs and
        batting down passes. Dallas had one other shot at a
        touchdown, reaching the Carolina 2 with just under six
        minutes left, but Daryl Johnston couldn't hold Aikman's
        pass, and the Cowboys again had to settle for Boniol,
        making the score 23-17. </p>
        <p>Then Stark dropped a 39-yard punt dead on the Dallas 2
        with 3:44 remaining. A pass-interference call on Tyrone
        Poole got the Cowboys to the 32, and a holding call on
        Poole put it at the 37. </p>
        <p>But Pat Terrell sealed the game when he leaped in
        front of Kevin Williams and returned the interception 49
        yards to the Dallas 19. Kasay added a field goal from 32
        yards with 1:48 left. </p>
        <p>Dallas' only touchdown came on a 2-yard TD pass from
        Aikman to Johnston at the end of a 74-yard second-quarter
        drive that cut the deficit to 14-9. The Cowboys tried a
        two-point conversion and failed, but got the two points
        back when punter Rohn Stark fell on a snap over his head
        in the end zone for a safety. </p>
        <p>Chad Cota's 49-yard return of an interception set up
        Kasay's 24-yard field goal that made it 17-11 at
        halftime. </p>
        <p><b>SODDY WORK:</b> Lambeau Field, the muddy site of
        the Green Bay Packers' 35-14 victory over the San
        Francisco 49ers, will get some reworking. The NFL plans
        to bring in a groundskeeping consultant to help repair
        the turf. </p>

        governor</b></font><br>
<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Tom Humphrey, News-Sentinel
        Nashville bureau</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">N</font>ASHVILLE -- Gov. Don Sundquist
        says he was unaware that one of his former commissioners
        steered $1.1 million in funds from state parks to West
        Tennessee river rehabilitation projects. </p>
        <p>Both the governor and his new commissioner of the
        Department of Environment and Conservation, Milton
        Hamilton, say they intend to see that state parks -- some
        deemed in dire need of repairs by environmentalists --
        get their maintenance money in the coming year. </p>
        <p>Shortly before stepping down as commissioner of the
        Department of Conservation and Environment last spring,
        Don Dills authorized the funding for the West Tennessee
        River Basin Authority to be taken from the park
        maintenance monies. </p>
        <p>Dills was succeeded by Justin Wilson, who in turn was
        succeeded on Saturday by Hamilton, a veteran state
        legislator. </p>
        <p>''I don't think I can do anything about it in
        retrospect, but I would like to have known about it and
        perhaps I would have had some comments on it at the
        time,'' the governor said Friday. </p>
        <p>The West Tennessee river agency was created by the
        1996 Legislature to consolidate the Obion-Forked Deer
        River Authority with the Hatchie River Project, but the
        Legislature did not approprate any money for the new
        entity. </p>
        <p>Both Dills, a former state represenative from
        Dyersburg, and Hamilton, of Union City, have served on
        the board of the Obion-Forked Deer Authority. As a state
        senator, Hamilton co-sponsored the bill that created the
        new agency. Rep. Page Walley, R-Bolivar, and Sen. Tom
        Leatherwood, R-Bartlett, were lead sponsors. </p>
        <p>Hamilton and Walley both said they had no idea that
        money would be steered from state parks into the new
        authority. The men said both parks and the authority
        deserve funding, but there was no intent to interrelate
        them. </p>
        <p>Dills could not be reached for comment but was
        previously quoted as saying he felt obliged to seek
        funding for the newly created river authority -- which is
        under the oversight of his department -- and the park
        maintenance monies were the only source available. </p>
        <p>''I hate to look back in hindsight and say that it's
        bad . . . but I don't know that it's a particularly good
        precedent,'' said Hamilton, who added that the governor
        and other top administration officials should be involved
        in anything that is ''such a strong political decision.''
        </p>
        <p>Any funding for the new authority next year, Hamilton
        said, will have to be fully justified. If it comes to a
        choice, Hamilton said he would lean to parks. </p>
        <p>''If you put one desperate need against another, it
        probably has to go to the parks this time,'' said
        Hamilton. </p>
        <p>The former agency, which served 14 West Tennessee
        counties in the drainage of the Obion and Forked Deer
        rivers, had been receiving about $500,000 per year from
        the state. </p>
        <p>The Hatchie River work had been conducted through the
        Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, which Walley said
        wanted to stop using its monies for projects such as
        clearing debris and beaver dams from the Hatchie. </p>
        <p>The new agency adds three counties affected by the
        Hatchie -- Tipton, Fayette and Hardeman. Tipton and
        Fayette are in the districts of the state's two most
        powerful legislators -- Lt. Gov. John Wilder, speaker of
        the Senate, and House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh. </p>
        <p>''That's kind of the axis on which the state turns
        sometimes,'' quipped Walley of the Wilder and Naifeh
        districts. He said both speakers were supportive of the
        legislation. </p>
        <p>Walley said legislators anticipated that funding
        provided to the Obion-Forked Deer in past years would
        flow through the department to the new authority. That
        has been $500,000 in the past, making up the bulk of the
        agency's $800,000 budget -- with the balance coming from
        counties. </p>
        <p>Dills allocated $600,000 and added $500,000 more for
        ''capital improvements.'' </p>
        <p>''It sounds sort of like Peter was robbed to pay
        Paul,'' said Walley. ''I certainly want to make sure we
        seek to uncouple whatever was done with park maintenance
        from the Obion-Forked Deer and make funding of both a bit
        more logical. </p>
        <p>''It was certainly never the intention to take
        anything away from state parks.'' </p>
        <p>Walley said the idea was to ''try and streamline''
        state and regional efforts to work with federal agencies
        ''to resolve our sad situation in West Tennessee with
        swamped out crop and timber land and channelized stream
        beds that need restoration.'' </p>
        <p>The Obion and Forked Deer were both ''channelized,''
        or straightened, in the past. The Hatchie, Walley said,
        is the ''only pristine river channel we have left in West
        Tennessee'' but must be cleared periodically to prevent
        flooding and permit navigation. </p>
        <p>The Department of Environment and Conservation staff,
        in a published memo, has expressed concern over
        dilapadated conditions at some state parks and noted that
        money for repairs and maintenance has been ''inadequate
        and inconsistent'' for years. Even in the best budget
        year, when $4 million was provided in 1993-94, the memo
        said that only 30 percent of most-needed maintenance work
        could be done at the 51 state parks. </p>
        <p>''There is no question that the parks need more
        maintenance,'' said Wilson. ''We have not been able, as
        best I can determine, to meet those needs in the last 20
        years.'' </p>
        <p>Wilson said he was unaware of Dills' action until well
        after it occured, ''but I'm not going to say there was
        anything improper about that.'' He did say that, in
        preparing a draft of next year's department budget before
        leaving office, there is no line item appropriation for
        the West Tennessee rivers projects. </p>
        <p>''The West Tennessee tributaries don't belong in the
        parks,'' he said. He declined to say whether the budget
        recommends any increase in parks maintenance monies to
        make up for Dills' reductions this year. </p>

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Program helps Alzheimer&#39;s patients</B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Music donated to aid memory treatment</FONT><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Amy Smith, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>magine forgetting family, friends or what you did 10, even five, minutes ago.
<P>   This is Alzheimer&#39;s disease.
<P>   Alzheimer&#39;s is a progressive, degenerative, irreversible neurological disease that attacks the brain and results in impaired memory, thinking and behavior.
<P>   The disease affects 4 million Americans and is the fourth leading cause of death in adults, after heart disease, cancer and stroke.
<P>   While progress has been made in understanding Alzheimer&#39;s disease, there still is no cure.
<P>   But researchers have found that Alzheimer&#39;s patients, whose short-term memory deteriorates, can often recall music from decades ago because the last section of the brain affected by the disease is the part that remembers music.
<P>   Because of this, music therapy is proving to be a successful form of therapy in the treatment of Alzheimer&#39;s.
<P>   The Eastern Tennessee chapter of the Alzheimer&#39;s Association has teamed up with Now! Audio Video to provide such therapy for Alzheimer&#39;s patients through &#39;&#39;Albums for Alzheimer&#39;s.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Through Jan. 15, Now! Audio Video will be the collection site for 331/3 records and cassette tapes of music from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s that will be distributed to nursing homes and adult day-care centers throughout the Knoxville area.
<P>   The records and tapes will be used in music therapy to treat patients with Alzheimer&#39;s in hopes that tunes from a patient&#39;s past will trigger long- and short-term memory, decrease agitation and enhance reality orientation.
<P>   &#39;&#39;This music will make a big difference in the lives of people with Alzheimer&#39;s,&#39;&#39; said Janice Wade, executive director of the Eastern Tennessee chapter of the Alzheimer&#39;s Association. &#39;&#39;Music is an invaluable tool in the treatment of Alzheimer&#39;s because of the profound effect it has on patients&#39; memory.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Music therapy is a health service, much like occupational and physical therapy. It uses music to address physical, psychological, cognitive and social functioning.
<P>   Music therapists are trained in the use of rhythm and melody to improve psychological and emotional well-being. They implement music therapy programs with individuals and groups in psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, community mental health centers, residences for the developmentally disabled and correctional facilities.
<P>   According to the Alzheimer&#39;s Association, among the benefits of music therapy are relaxation and stress reduction, exercise for the mind and body and expression of emotion.
<P>   The Alzheimer&#39;s Association reports that:
<P>   * Singing increases a chemical in the body, endorphin, which acts as an antidepressant.
<P>   * Singing songs helps increase oxygen intake, which improves brain functions, blood circulation, lung expansion and posture.
<P>   * Music therapy can facilitate memory recall, which contributes to reminiscing and satisfaction with life.
<P>   * Music therapy can also render a sense of control over life through successful experiences.
<P>   * Stimulation caused by music therapy provokes interest even when no other approach is effective.
<P>   Numerous albums and cassettes already have been donated for the &#39;&#39;Albums for Alzheimer&#39;s&#39;&#39; program, but more are still needed.
<P>   Albums and cassettes may be dropped off at Now! Audio Video at 8416 Kingston Pike during regular store hours: Mondays through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; and Sundays, 1-6 p.m.

<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>hief executives think more about the bottom line than they do their corner offices, according to a survey on office trends.
<P>   Seventy-five percent of Fortune 1000 company executives polled said they&#39;d give up their private offices if they knew it would enhance their companies&#39; productivity, according to a survey conducted for Hixson, an architectural, engineering and interior design firm based in Cincinnati.
<P>   Seventy-five percent of the 150 executives also agreed that today the office is less of a status symbol and more a &#39;&#39;high tech tool to achieve business goals.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The executives overwhelmingly (by 93 percent) agreed that the design and physical structure of a company&#39;s offices have an impact on employee productivity.
<P>
<P>   <B>COMPUTER CAREERS IN 1997</B> -- Companies will be paying more to find employees with the right talents and the hottest computer skills in 1997, according to Computerworld, a newspaper for information system professionals.
<P>   People skilled in PeopleSoft, a payroll system, and other enterprise business applications are most in demand, earning 29 percent more than other information systems staff in the same organization, a Computerworld survey of 804 information systems managers said.
<P>
<P>   <B>NO TIME TO SPARE Ä</B> Many executives probably have New Year&#39;s resolutions to spend more time with their families, but few think they&#39;ll carry out those plans.
<P>    Christian & Timbers, an executive research firm, surveyed 100 CEOs of big and small firms and found that while 85 percent want to give more time to their families, only 7 percent believe it will happen.
<P>    Business moves at such a fast pace these days that &#39;&#39;CEOs who do not deliver results quickly will be out. That is reality, and it puts the family on the back burner,&#39;&#39; said Jeffrey Christian, who&#39;s the CEO of Christian and Timbers.
<P>
<P>   <B>BULL MARKET IN NUMBER CRUNCHERS Ä</B> The first quarter of 1997 will see about a 5 percent increase in the hiring of accounting and financial professionals at U.S. firms, says the employment concern Robert Half International.
<P>   The company surveyed chief financial officers at randomly selected companies and found that about 8.6 percent expect an increase in hiring of number crunchers. Nearly 87 percent of the CFOs say hiring activity will remain unchanged from strong levels in 1996, while only 3.5 percent say hiring will decline.
<P>
<P>   <B>TILTING AT WINDMILLS</B> --  Denmark has become the world&#39;s largest producer of windmills following the bankruptcy of a U.S. manufacturer, a Danish association claimed.
<P>    In the past four years, Danish wind turbine production has quadrupled, delivering more than 600 megawatts of new generating capacity every 12 months -- the equivalent of a medium-sized nuclear power station, the Danish Wind Turbine Manufacturers Association said.
<P>    In 1995, Denmark supplied nearly half the world&#39;s wind turbines. With the bankruptcy last year of Kenetech, one of the world&#39;s three largest makers, Danish companies now have 60 percent of the world market, the association said.
<P>    Denmark began a national windmill program in 1979 under pressure from organizations demanding new sources of electricity that have less impact on the environment than conventional power plants.
<P>
<P>    The main wind-energy producers include Germany, Britain, India, China and the United States.
<P>
<P>   <B>AVOIDING THE OBVIOUS Ä</B> Joseph Weintraub, a professor of management at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., has a lot of advice to offer people who are trying to win over the boss. Some is a bit tongue-in-cheek but worth following anyway. For example, when the boss starts talking about lofty concepts like trust and empowerment, don&#39;t laugh. When the boss starts telling that same war story for the umpty-bumpth time, don&#39;t finish the sentences you&#39;ve learned by heart. And when you start hearing how the boss operated at a previous job, try to look interested.

<FONT SIZE="+2">G</FONT>REEN BAY, Wis. -- Desmond Howard, an NFL castoff and bargain free agent, returned the Green Bay Packers to the NFC championship game.
<P>    Howard&#39;s punt returns jump-started Green Bay, then the Packers ground the San Francisco 49ers into the Lambeau Field mud, beating them 35-14. That means they will play host to the winner of today&#39;s Dallas-Carolina game next Sunday in an effort to reach their first Super Bowl in 29 years.
<P>    Howard, the former Heisman Trophy winner who failed in Washington and Jacksonville, returned his first punt 71 yards for a score.
<P>    After a fair catch on his second, he took the third one 46 yards to set up Brett Favre&#39;s 4-yard touchdown pass to Andre Rison. That gave Green Bay a 14-0 lead while it had only 9 yards total on offense.
<P>    It was a mistake-filled game, caused largely by rain and mud, as the Packers (14-3) beat the 49ers in the NFC semifinals for the second consecutive season. San Francisco had five turnovers, four in the second half.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We were concerned with Desmond Howard, but we thought we could contain him,&#39;&#39; 49ers coach George Seifert said. &#39;&#39;But he&#39;s a heck of a player and popped big plays for them all season. That&#39;s one of the reasons they&#39;re in the position they&#39;re in.&#39;&#39;
<P>    &#39;&#39;My major concern was to try to field the ball,&#39;&#39; Howard said. &#39;&#39;With the rain coming down and the wind pretty gusty, that was going to be first and foremost.
<P>    &#39;&#39;If I can catch it cleanly, then we always feel we can score.&#39;&#39;
<P>    In the closing minutes, the frenzied crowd chanted, &#39;&#39;We want Dallas!&#39;&#39;
<P>    The Cowboys have ended the Packers&#39; season three years in a row, each time at Texas Stadium. The Packers, who won their 17th in a row at Lambeau, are undefeated in 10 home playoff games.
<P>    Just as they did in knocking the Niners from the playoffs last year, the Packers jumped to a 21-0 lead by dominating San Francisco (13-5) in all phases. The third TD was a 2-yard run by Edgar Bennett in the second quarter following Craig Newsome&#39;s interception of Elvis Grbac.
<P>    An ineffective and ailing Steve Young, trying to play with ribs bruised in last week&#39;s win over Philadelphia, was pulled in favor of Grbac early in the first quarter. Bryant Young, San Francisco&#39;s All-Pro defensive tackle, was taken off the field on a stretcher after hurting his back and neck in the first half.
<P>    Thanks to Howard&#39;s two big returns, the Packers were able to keep the ball on the ground.Bennett carried 17 times for a total of 80 yards and Favre, the two-time MVP, threw only 15 times, completing 11 for 79 yards.
<P>    Despite their early dominance, the Packers gave up two TDs in a 40-second span covering the end of the first half and start of the second as San Francisco cut the lead to 21-14.
<P>    Both came after turnovers on special teams -- one on a punt at the end of the first half, the second on the opening kickoff of the second half.
<P>    The 49ers, playing for the third time in 13 days, didn&#39;t get past midfield on their first seven possessions, which ended in six punts and an interception.
<P>    But they scored with 24 seconds left in the first half on Grbac&#39;s 8-yard TD pass to Terry Kirby. The Niners got the ball at the Green Bay 26 when Tommy Thompson&#39;s punt bounced off the Packers&#39; Chris Hayes and was recovered by Curtis Buckley.
<P>    Then, at the start of the second half, Steve Israel recovered Jeff Wilkins&#39; bouncing kickoff at the Green Bay 4 after it squirted past Don Beebe.
<P>    On first-and-goal, Grbac scored on a bootleg that made it 21-14 just 16 seconds into the third period.
<P>    But the Packers responded with a 72-yard scoring drive, 52 of the yards on the ground.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I thought the table was getting ready to turn, but to their credit, they marched the ball right down the field,&#39;&#39; said receiver Jerry Rice, who caught five passes for just 36 yards.
<P>    &#39;&#39;That drive proved what a great team they really are,&#39;&#39; said Seifert, who fell to 0-3 against Packers coach Mike Holmgren, his former offensive coordinator. &#39;&#39;That drive was the sign of a championship team.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Bennett fumbled as he crossed the goal line, and the Lambeau Field record crowd of 60,787 sat in silence as officials peeled off bodies from the pile. The fans erupted when it was ruled that Packers split end Antonio Freeman recovered.
<P>    That made it 28-14 with 6:50 left in the third period.
<P>    The Niners were driving again when William Floyd fumbled at the Green Bay 19 and the Packers&#39; Brian Williams recovered in the muck with 11:14 left.
<P>    The 49ers forced a punt, but Mike Prior punched the ball out of Kirby&#39;s hand on the return and Hayes recovered San Francisco&#39;s third turnover at the 49ers&#39; 32.
<P>    Bennett took it in from the 11 with 5:31 left, making it 35-14.
<P>    Eugene Robinson picked off Grbac twice in the final 5:16 to end the 49ers&#39; hopes.
<P>    Young was 2-for-5 for 8 yards and had one scramble for 3 yards before being replaced by Grbac, who started or relieved Young in eight games this season.
<P>    Grbac was 19 of 36 for 125 yards and three interceptions. He was the 49ers&#39; leading rusher with 32 yards on four carries.
<P>    With a reading of 34 degrees at kickoff and a wind-chill of 9 degrees, Favre improved to 18-0 in home games with temperatures 35 or lower.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Really and truly, there is a lot of doubt among NFL teams about this football team,&#39;&#39; said general manager Ron Wolf of the Packers. &#39;&#39;I think today we erased any doubt.&#39;&#39;

        Resolve,'' a six-part look at New Year's resolutions
        people commonly make. Today's topic looks at improving
        family relationships by spending more time together. </p>
        <p>Lisa and Greg Kellar can juggle with the best of busy
        parents. She's a physician. He recently received his
        doctoral degree. They have five children, ages four
        months to 10 years. </p>
        <p>Terry Nix seldom has time to sit down either. She's a
        fourth-grade teacher at Dogwood Elementary School and a
        single parent to five children, ages six to 16. </p>
        <p>Yet despite schedules that would bring many to their
        knees, the Kellars and Nix designate time each week to
        talking, playing and praying with their children. It's
        time they feel is crucial to their families and to making
        sure their children learn the real keys to happiness. </p>

        </center></div><p>Both the Kellars and Nix belong to the
        Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or the
        Mormon church. Their faith requires families to devote
        time each week to ''family home evenings,'' during which
        they worship together, discuss values and important
        issues and simply play. </p>
        <p>''The more kids we have, the more committed we are to
        family home evenings,'' says Lisa Kellar. ''Even now we
        can see a benefit with our children. It gives us time to
        sit down and formally say, 'Look, kids, this is what we
        want you to learn. This is the kind of person we want you
        to be.' '' </p>
        <p>But that doesn't mean it's only up to the Kellar
        parents to plan their weekly gatherings. Everyone but
        baby Catherine gets involved in planning lessons,
        choosing songs to sing, organizing snacks and selecting
        fun activities to do together. </p>
        <p>The Kellars also use their family home evenings,
        especially in the summertime, to do the things with their
        children that tend to get put off until 'someday.' </p>
        <p>''This is when we can go to baseball games and the
        park,'' Lisa Kellar says. ''It gives us the opportunity
        to keep our promises to our kids.'' </p>
        <p>At the Nix household, the children do all the planning
        while their mother serves as an advisor and helps when
        they need it. </p>
        <p>''I found out I enjoyed family home evenings a lot
        more when I didn't have to be the one responsible for
        them. It was just one more thing to do,'' says Nix. ''Now
        the children are learning responsibility and finding out
        how much they're really capable of doing.'' </p>
        <p>Her children rotate jobs monthly. One chooses an
        opening song, another a prayer, another a lesson or a
        Bible story, another a game or fun activity, and the
        fifth child decides what snack to serve. </p>
        <p>''Jeremy (Nix's 16-year-old son) isn't always the most
        prepared,'' Nix admits. ''Sometimes he thinks he's too
        old for it. But he also enjoys the younger children and
        seeing what they do.'' </p>
        <p>The family tries to finish their lesson and snack
        within half an hour and then spend as much time as they
        want playing together. They also use the time to
        recognize a family member who's done something special
        that week and to coordinate activities for the upcoming
        week. </p>
        <p>''The kids love it. It can get very rowdy and loud,
        and sometimes I wonder if they're really getting anything
        out of it,'' Nix says. ''But it's something they all look
        forward to. They know no matter how busy the week is,
        we'll do something fun together. The world will make way
        for us and what we want to do.'' </p>
        <p>Lisa Kellar thinks family home evenings have helped
        she and her husband better communicate their parenting
        styles and beliefs. </p>
        <p>''I can see what Greg's attitudes are when he's
        teaching a lesson,'' she says. ''There have been times
        he's really surprised me with something he's said, and
        we've been able to talk about things before they become
        issues. It helps me to know what he expects as a
        father.'' </p>
        <p>The Mormon church provides a resource book to its
        members to help them plan family home evenings, but
        Kellar finds their lessons come as often from what's
        happening at home or at school. </p>
        <p>''We may do a lesson about hitting and about how to
        react to other people when they make you mad,'' she says.
        ''Or we may talk about something that's happened to
        somebody at school. Hopefully we talk about enough of
        those things to help them deal with encounters before
        they face them. </p>
        <p>''Because of family home evenings, I think I have
        better communication with my kids, and I worry a little
        less about them.'' </p>
        <p>Terry Nix agrees. ''You have to do it to become a firm
        believer in it,'' she says. ''Start in on faith, and
        afterwards you'll see the benefits. I know my children
        are happier as a result.'' </p>

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Environment head to look to Wilson for Pigeon advice</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Tom Humphrey, News-Sentinel Nashville Bureau</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- Milton Hamilton, scheduled to take the oath of office as Tennessee&#39;s top environmental officer today, says he will still look to outgoing Commissioner Justin Wilson for advice on Pigeon River policy.
<P>    Hamilton said in an interview Friday that he was not familiar with all details of the dispute between North Carolina and Tennessee over Champion International Inc.&#39;s pollution of the Pigeon River.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Justin has brought me slightly up to speed on it,&#39;&#39; said Hamilton. &#39;&#39;I have asked him to really stay and pursue that to fruition -- if not actively in the department, at least on a personal basis.&#39;&#39;
<P>    As commissioner of the state Department of Environment and Conservation, Wilson has had a lead role in dealing with the Environmental Protection Agency and North Carolina over Champion&#39;s pollution permit.
<P>    Gov. Don Sundquist&#39;s appointment of Hamilton, 64, as the new comissioner fulfills a longstanding gubernatorial promise to give the former state senator a Cabinet position.
<P>    Hamilton, of Union City, split ranks with fellow Democrats in 1994 to back Republican Sundquist&#39;s campaign, then later officially switched parties to become a Republican.
<P>    He has served as a state legislator for 32 years -- four years as a House member and 28 as a senator. His last Senate term expired in November.
<P>    Hamilton said he expects considerable advice from Wilson on Champion as well as other major pending matters because &#39;&#39;I can relate to him and we see eye to eye on nearly every issue we talk about.&#39;&#39; Wilson said he will give the advice.
<P>    &#39;&#39;There is absolutely no question whatsoever that I will cooperate with Gov. Sundquist and Milton Hamilton on everthing I can, including the Pigeon River,&#39;&#39; said Wilson. &#39;&#39;We are going to clean up that river. Point blank. That&#39;s it. . . . I will do everything I can to accomplish that result.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Wilson planned to administer the oath of office to Hamilton today in ceremonies at Reelfoot Lake State Park. The outgoing commissioner declined to say what formal future role, if any, he will have in state government.
<P>    Said Hamilton: &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve said this to the governor and others: If he&#39;s not going to be involved in the environmental process, he sure needs to be involved somewhere.&#39;&#39;

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Packers look for tight (end) game</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By The Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">G</FONT>REEN BAY, Wis. -- With a patchwork offensive line and trouble inside the 20-yard line, Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre is counting on his tight end tandem to crack the tough defense of the San Francisco 49ers today.
<P>    When the Packers eliminated the 49ers from the playoffs 27-17 last year at San Francisco, Mark Chmura and Keith Jackson combined for 120 yards on seven receptions.
<P>    On Oct. 14 at Green Bay, when the Packers beat the 49ers 23-20 in overtime, Favre had a little more trouble. The Niners took away the tight ends after Jackson burned Ken Norton for 50 yards on the fifth play, and Favre was only 1-for-9 passing inside the 20 the rest of the game.
<P>    &#39;&#39;What they did basically was play a zone defense in the red zone,&#39;&#39; Favre said. &#39;&#39;It was more of a four-across with their secondary. We shot it into the end zone a couple of times and it was covered.
<P>    &#39;&#39;That&#39;s where we have to be willing to take the short things. It&#39;s hard to take short passes in the red zone. If you&#39;re on the 10, you don&#39;t want to throw it to the 8. You want to take shots. But that&#39;s what you have to do and hope that guys break tackles.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Then, when you catch them in man coverage, you have to make it count.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The 49ers (13-4) have been susceptible to big games from tight ends.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We haven&#39;t totally figured out a way to do that, have we?&#39;&#39; 49ers coach George Seifert said. &#39;&#39;We were burned by the tight ends again this last game, as we were certainly in the playoffs a year ago.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The thing that makes it tough is Green Bay does a good job of getting the ball to the outside receivers. You overplay them, then they get the ball to the tight end. When you&#39;re defending all that, then they run the screen pass on you.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The 49ers were seventh in yards allowed in the NFL this season and defeated Philadelphia 14-0 in a playoff opener last week. The Eagles had problems with the 49ers&#39; extensive use of zone blitzing in which defensive linemen dropped into coverage and linebackers or defensive backs rushed.
<P>    Coach Mike Holmgren said the Packers have to make the 49ers pay when they use safeties Merton Hanks and Tim McDonald to double the outside receivers, leaving the middle open.

        <p>Two armed and masked men barged into a South Knoxville
        bank Thursday and took control of the tellers and
        customers before escaping with an undisclosed amount of
        cash. </p>
        <p>But the duo abandoned some of the money when dye packs
        slipped into the stacks of cash by bank tellers began
        exploding. </p>
        <p>While the robbers escaped, Knoxville police did nab
        three auto theft suspects who had the misfortune of being
        in a stolen car that matched the description of the car
        used in the bank heist. </p>
        <p>Men armed with a .38-caliber pistol and a shotgun
        entered the Tennessee State Bank, 3314 Chapman Highway,
        about 10:40 a.m., according to police. Both wore ski
        masks or tobaggans with eyes and mouth wholes cut out. </p>
        <p>''They basically came in and took control of the
        bank,'' FBI agent Scott Nowinski said. </p>
        <p>The men fled in a gray or light blue 1979 to 1981
        Oldmobile 98. Nowinski said officials ''feel very
        confident'' about the description of the robbers' car
        because it was seen by car dealers at a used car lot
        across the street from the bank. </p>
        <p>The car turned onto Druid Drive from Chapman Highway
        and then onto Chamberlain Boulevard, where a red dye pack
        tucked among the stacks of cash exploded. The robbers
        apparently tossed the bag of cash out of the car, which
        was filled with smoke. </p>
        <p>Watching the episode was Thomas Turner of Chamberlain
        Boulevard, who was standing on his front porch. </p>
        <p>''I saw the car stop,'' Turner said. ''I saw pink
        smoke coming from it. </p>
        <p>''It was billows of smoke; it looked like it was on
        fire. I almost started down there to see if they needed
        help. I'm glad I didn't now.'' </p>
        <p>Turner said both men got out of the car and one of the
        suspects ''was scrambling to gather (the cash) up.'' The
        driver, who had been coughing harshly from the smoke, got
        back into the car and began ''yelling at the other guy to
        get in the car,'' Turner said. </p>
        <p>Outside Turner's house the road was covered with cash
        and money wrappers stained with red dye. Police collected
        the tainted cash and a .38-caliber bullet left with it. </p>
        <p>Authorities said they don't know how much cash the
        robbers gathered. </p>
        <p>''We haven't counted it yet.'' Nowinski said. ''It'll
        be interesting to see how much we gathered up.'' </p>
        <p>As officers combed South Knoxville for the getaway
        car, they received a call from a local television
        reporter who saw a blue Oldsmobile on Minnis Avenue,
        Knoxville Police Department Investigator Larry Vineyard
        said. </p>
        <p>Officers converged on the car and took three juveniles
        into custody. Subsequent investigation revealed the three
        boys probably ''didn't have anything to do with the bank
        robbery,'' KPD spokesman Foster Arnett Jr. said. </p>
        <p>But the Oldsmobile 98 the trio was in had been
        reported stolen Dec. 31 from Chuckey, Tenn., Vineyard
        said. </p>
        <p>So the two boys from Knoxville, one 16 and the other
        17, and a 17-year-old boy from Chuckey were charged with
        auto theft. </p>
        <p>Nowinski described the bank robbers as white and
        wearing gloves with the fingers cut out. One man was 6
        foot tall, weighed 160 to 170 pounds, had a medium build
        and was in his 20s. The second man was 5 foot-9 inches
        tall, 160 to 170 pounds and also in his 20s. </p>

        theft, agrees to pay restitution</b></font><br>
<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Ray Snader, News Sentinel staff</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">N</font>EWPORT, Tenn. -- A former clerk at
        Wal-Mart in Newport has pleaded guilty to a charge of
        theft under $500, but will be paying $51,000 in
        restitution, police said said. </p>
        <p>Sharee Ellen Kyle, 23, of Newport entered the plea
        Tuesday in Cocke County Sessions Court. </p>
        <p>Kyle was working as a clerk at the Wal-Mart on Dec. 9
        when a customer brought a drill kit and two VCRs to a
        cash register, according to testimony. </p>
        <p>Although the items had been priced at $319.89 plus
        tax, the customer paid only $6.02, including tax. Bar
        codes on the items had been changed, store officials
        said. </p>
        <p>The incident was observed by Wal-Mart officials, who
        then interviewed Kyle before police arrived. </p>
        <p>She had been a clerk at the store since July. </p>
        <p>Kyle admitted she had been approached by two women who
        asked her if she wanted to earn extra money, according to
        court records. She agreed and allowed the women to change
        bar codes and purchase items at lower prices. </p>
        <p>She told investigators she received $10, 20 and $50
        payments at various times from the women. </p>
        <p>''We couldn't prove any other offense other than the
        one with the women to which she pleaded guilty,'' said
        Assistant District Attorney Richard Vance. </p>
        <p>Under the plea agreement, Kyle received probation of
        11 months, 29 days and must pay court costs of $132.50.
        However, in a separate agreement with Wal-Mart officials,
        Kyle agreed to pay $51,000 to the company in monthly
        payments over the next 10 years, officials said. </p>
        <p>Newport Police Detective Jimmy Gregg said the
        investigation is continuing into the other two women. </p>
        <p>He said the restitution agreement with Wal-Mart was
        reached before police were notified. </p>

        the sale is not complete. </p>
        <p>About 550 seasonal workers have already been laid off.
        About 325 employees still work at the printed circuit
        board plant and at the refurbishing and parts warehouse
        operations at Plant 2, union officials said. </p>
        <p>Total Philips employment in Greeneville is said to run
        between 2,100 and 2,300 in peak production. About 1,400
        people work there now, according to the union that
        represents them, the International Union of Electronic,
        Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers,
        AFL-CIO, Local 796. </p>
        <p>In a statement updating information on worker layoff
        notices under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
        Notification (WARN) Act, Philips advised about 87
        employees at the printed circuit board plant and the 45
        service parts warehouse employees they will remain with
        Philips beyond Dec. 31, while Philips searches for a
        buyer. </p>
        <p>About 160 refurbishing plant employees got layoff
        notices earlier this week when Philips announced it was
        discontinuing its television refurbishing operations at
        Plant 2, which also houses the parts warehouse. Those
        notices are effective during the first quarter of 1997. </p>
        <p>Philips has said it will contract the refurbishing
        work with Ozark Electronics of Gravette, Ark. and High
        Quality International USA Inc. of Rancho Cucamonga,
        Calif. </p>
        <p>Philips is seeking buyers for its Greeneville
        operations in the face of declining volume in the
        television industry and a restructuring of its parent
        company, Philips NV of the Netherlands. The company is
        also moving 150<b> &127;</b>executives and staff --
        essentially its Knoxville headquarters leadership -- to
        Atlanta, where a new consolidated sales organization will
        be organized. About 500 engineers and other staff will
        remain in Knoxville and about 350 in the customer service
        center in Jefferson City. </p>
        <p>GC Capital LLC, a group headed by George Taylor and
        Charles White, is trying to complete the purchase of the
        Greeneville Plant 3 operations, which include the
        electronics manufacturing, injection molding and
        television warehousing and distribution facilities. Both
        Taylor and White are also principals of JC Cabinet Co. --
        the company that bought and now operates the former
        Philips wood cabinet factory in Jefferson City. </p>

        <font size="5">I</font>RVING, Texas -- Dallas quarterback
        Troy Aikman says there's no question he's concerned about
        his team's image. But, he added, ''I'm still proud to
        wear a helmet with a star on it.'' </p>
        <p>Running back Emmitt Smith says he thinks his teammates
        are ''just fed up with all we've been hearing throughout
        the year.'' Then he added: ''We'll just shake it off and
        keep on moving.'' </p>
        <p>The Dallas Cowboys tried to do just that Wednesday, a
        day after being jolted by the latest distraction in a
        season full of them: A 23-year-old woman accused wide
        receiver Michael Irvin of holding a gun to her head while
        offensive tackle Erik Williams and another man allegedly
        raped her. </p>
        <p>Irvin and Williams practiced for Sunday's NFC
        divisional playoff game against the Carolina Panthers. On
        Thursday, police said they were in the early stages of an
        investigation. </p>
        <p>Aikman said the team was handling the latest
        distraction fairly well. </p>
        <p>''Obviously it's some distraction, but I don't think
        it's going to keep us from preparing to play like we have
        to come out and play,'' Aikman said. ''I don't know if
        you ever get used to distractions. This team has overcome
        a great deal of adversity. We'll just have to see.'' </p>
        <p>''I want to be proud of this organization,'' he said.
        ''I'm proud of what we have accomplished.'' </p>
        <p>So is teammate Bill Bates, though he said all the
        turmoil ''makes me sick to my stomach.'' </p>
        <p>The safety-linebacker said his children asked him what
        was going on. </p>
        <p>''I just told them that people in life sometimes have
        problems and that nobody is perfect,'' he said. ''Things
        happen and not just to the Cowboys. It's happening all
        over the NFL, the world, the nation. Nothing shocks me
        anymore. Just turn on the TV. It's society in general.'' </p>

        <font size="5"><br>
        For first time since '84, UT fails to sell all its bowl
        tickets</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Jimmy Hyams, N-S assistant sports
        editor</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">O</font>RLANDO, Fla. -- A season that had
        its share of ups and downs ended with a resounding up as
        Peyton Manning directed No. 9 Tennessee to a 48-28
        victory over Northwestern in Florida Citrus Bowl on
        Wednesday. </p>
        <p>Manning passed for 408 yards and four touchdowns
        before leaving to the chants of ''Stay, Peyton, stay!''
        from the Tennessee fans in attendance. </p>
        <p>The junior quarterback now must decide whether to skip
        his last season of college eligibility and turn pro or
        hang around for a shot at some major goals that eluded
        him this year: beating Florida, a Southeastern Conference
        championship and gaining a national championship. </p>
        <p>That decision will wait. </p>
        <p>''I made a decision before this game that this game
        would have no bearing on my decision (on going pro),''
        Manning said. ''I'm going to have fun tonight and take my
        time with this decision.'' </p>
        <p>What mattered to UT fans most was that Manning was on
        the field as he orchestrated a 21-point first quarter,
        then hit Joey Kent with a 67-yard TD pass after the
        Wildcats had rallied to tie. </p>
        <p>The UT defense, playing with a patched-together line,
        did its share, holding the Wildcats' high-powered running
        attack to 43 yards. </p>
        <p>Vol fans will have to wait until Friday to find out
        where the Vols will finish in the polls. </p>
        <p>If Wednesday's Citrus Bowl turnout is any indication,
        UT fans expected more from this season. For the first
        time since the 1984 Sun Bowl, Tennessee failed to sell
        its ticket allotment to a bowl game. </p>
        <p>The Vols' ticket office sold less than 10,000 of its
        12,000 allotment, with another 1,100 going to players,
        coaches, the band and UT's official party. </p>
        <p>Tennessee donated 1,000 tickets to the Citrus Bowl
        Foundation to be distributed to local charities. Each
        ticket cost $45. </p>
        <p>''We sold 23,000 (after the 1993 season), we sold
        18,000 last year, then we sold about 10,000,'' Tennessee
        athletic director Doug Dickey said. ''That's not bad,
        coming back (two years in a row). I'm not bothered by
        that. We've had a good run with our fans.'' </p>
        <p>Dickey said this year's Citrus Bowl didn't have the
        appeal as last year's game, when Tennessee and Ohio State
        each were once-beaten and tied for fourth in The
        Associated Press poll. </p>
        <p>''Us playing Ohio State for No. 2 or 3 was a
        high-water mark, and we're back off that high-water mark
        right now,'' Dickey said. </p>
        <p>''Last year, it was a glamour game. Ohio State was
        somebody our people could really relate to as a big boy
        in college football. And we hadn't played Ohio State
        before. </p>
        <p>''This one didn't have the glamour that one had, let's
        face it.'' </p>
        <p>Dickey said he's not sure how many Tennessee fans
        living in Florida bought tickets through the Florida
        Citrus Bowl and not through UT. </p>
        <p>''One problem is, we're in competition with the Citrus
        Bowl to sell tickets when they haven't sold theirs out,''
        Dickey said. </p>
        <p>Attendance was announced as 63,467 -- the seventh
        largest in Citrus Bowl history. But there were at least
        5,000 empty seats, and it marked just the third time
        since the 1980 season the game was not a sellout. UT
        appeared to have at least 15,000 fans wearing orange and
        white. </p>
        <p>Dickey said he would like to rewrite the SEC's and the
        Big Ten's contract with the Citrus Bowl so that the
        schools combined must guarantee 24,000 tickets, rather
        than each team be responsible for 12,000. Northwestern
        sold about 16,000 tickets. </p>
        <p>''If Tennessee sells 18,000 one year, we should not be
        penalized the next year for selling 10,000,'' Dickey
        said. </p>
        <p>Dickey noted attendance at many bowls -- in particular
        the Orange Bowl this season -- has tailed off. Last year,
        the only Florida bowl game that didn't suffer a decline
        at the gate was the Citrus Bowl. </p>

        he's retired, it's a misnomer. </p>
        <p>Five years ago Hanna quit his paying job as a tax
        accountant for Ford Motor Co. in Detroit only to take on
        multiple volunteer jobs in Gatlinburg. </p>

                the award with civic work ranging from chairing
                the Anna Porter Library board of trustees to
                hosting the city's New Year's Eve celebration. He
                is a retired Ford Motor Co. accountant.</strong></font></td>

        </table>
        <p>''I worked 36 years. Now we're doing
        things we want to do,'' said Hanna, whose wife, Virginia,
        joins him in many of his volunteer efforts. </p>
        <p>The City of Gatlinburg has named Bob Hanna its
        volunteer of the year for 1996. </p>
        <p>''Bob has done a lot of hard work for the city that we
        really appreciate,'' said Vice Mayor George Hawkins. ''We
        just need more volunteers like that.'' </p>
        <p>Most recently, Hanna emceed the New Year's Eve
        celebration at the Space Needle in Gatlinburg at midnight
        on New Year's Eve. He led the massed crowds in the
        macarena from atop the Space Needle's game center while
        thousands waited for the lighted ball to drop, signaling
        the start of a New Year. </p>
        <p>On Christmas Eve, Hanna spent the late afternoon and
        evening ringing a bell for the Salvation Army outside
        Battle's Supermarket, raising $450 along with another
        volunteer. </p>
        <p>''Nobody gets past him,'' quipped his wife. </p>
        <p>During the rest of the year, Hanna can be found
        building floats for the city's annual Christmas and
        Fourth of July parade extravaganzas, volunteering for the
        Gatlinburg Kiwanis or raising money for the expansion of
        the Anna Porter Public Library, where he is a trustee. </p>
        <p>''That's my heart and soul -- the library. It's a
        wonderful library but there's not enough room,'' said
        Hanna, who began giving books to the library and visiting
        regularly almost from the day he arrived here. </p>
        <p>Hanna and his wife, Virginia, first came through
        Gatlinburg and the Smoky Mountains during a vacation in
        1970. They planned to spend part of one afternoon and a
        night. Instead, they ended up staying for several days. </p>
        <p>''We fell in love with the place. We came back again
        and eventually we bought a condominium and made plans to
        retire here,'' said Hanna. </p>
        <p>Five years ago, at age 60, the Hannas made the leap
        from the flatlands to the hills of the Great Smoky
        Mountains. ''The mountains, the trees, the green
        everywhere are just so wonderful,'' said Hanna, whose
        condominium in Hidden Hills has a view of Mount LeConte.
        It's often filled with some of their six children, 12
        grandchildren and three great-grandchildren who visit. </p>
        <p>The many good friends they have made here are more
        than enough payment for the work they have done, said the
        Hannas, who are well known for spreading their enthusiasm
        for Gatlinburg to other residents and visitors. </p>
        <p>One couple he recruited to get involved with the
        parades now travel from Decatur, Ill., regularly to help
        with preparations for Gatlinburg's holiday extravaganzas.
        </p>
        <p>''People always want to stand on the sidelines. I say,
        'Get involved,' '' Hanna said. </p>

        emerging from debt</b></font><br>

        <font size="5">N</font>ASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Regina
        from Russellville, Ky., sounds desperate. </p>
        <p>She's $10,000 in debt because of her husband's strokes
        and the creditors are calling. She makes only $25,000 a
        year to support herself, her husband and two teen-agers.
        What is she going to do? </p>
        <p>''You're going to have to do some painful things to
        get out of this,'' Dave Ramsey tells her over the phone
        and, at the same time, thousands of listeners tuned into
        his ''The Money Game'' financial advice radio talk show. </p>
        <p>Regina must sell the car that costs her $287 a month,
        Ramsey says, and instead, drive the paid-for car her
        children are using. </p>
        <p>''They're gonna scream and yell, but you've got to do
        it,'' he says. </p>
        <p>Ramsey is well known to audiences in the Southeast and
        places like Spokane, Wash., for his tough approach to
        getting out of debt. Soon he'll be heard and seen
        nationwide. </p>
        <p>He's going on a book tour promoting a new version of
        1992's ''Financial Peace,'' which is landing him on
        programs like ''The Today Show'' and he'll be heard on an
        expanded radio market that includes Las Vegas and Grand
        Rapids, Mich. </p>
        <p>Audiences will hear Ramsey tell people like Regina to
        keep giving money to their churches, despite what
        creditors say. (He closes every show with the advice that
        the only way to ''financial peace is to walk with the
        Prince of Peace.'') And to hold her head high and work
        with the creditors on a plan to pay them off and then do
        it. </p>
        <p>He knows firsthand what they're going through. </p>
        <p>''I have been there. It is not easy. It is NOT easy.
        But you can do it,'' he says. </p>
        <p>Ramsey doesn't hesitate to tell everybody who asks
        what happened and how he got out of debt. </p>
        <p>In 1985, he was 26, driving a Jaguar and carrying a $4
        million real estate portfolio. But he also had $1.2
        million in 90-day notes from a bank. When the bank was
        sold, the new owners called all his notes. </p>
        <p>That started a chain reaction in which he lost
        everything except his house and his wife. It took him
        three years to pay everything off. </p>
        <p>Now, he's working his way back to millionaire status,
        but he owes no money, drives old, paid-for vehicles and
        hasn't loaded his life down with expensive things. That's
        what he wants for everyone, advocating ''what in 1950 was
        called common sense.'' </p>
        <p>That means living within your means, not spending more
        than you earn. </p>
        <p>''There's nothing original about what I do, except in
        the presentation. I've been there, done that. I've got
        the T-shirt with the zeros on it,'' he said during an
        interview. ''It makes me approachable. It makes me
        touchable. It's not just the blathering of some guy's
        ego.'' </p>
        <p>His advice to the debt-ridden includes: </p>
        <p>-- A ''plasectomy,'' or cutting up all your credit
        cards; </p>
        <p>-- Attacking the debt with a budget, ''where you spend
        every dollar on paper before the month begins;'' </p>
        <p>-- Using a ''debt snowball,'' where you list debts
        from smallest to largest, pay the minimum on all the
        debts except the smallest. When it's paid off, use the
        money you were spending on the next largest debt, and so
        on; </p>
        <p>-- Either pay cash or don't buy it. </p>
        <p>But first, Ramsey says, you've got to want to change
        your life. </p>
        <p>''It's like waking up the adult inside each one of us,
        when the child has been managing the money,'' he said. </p>
        <p>Ramsey has earned thousands of supporters who credit
        him for their new debt-free lives. He also has critics,
        especially the bankers, insurers and car dealers that he
        ridicules. </p>
        <p>Nashville banker Brian Carden called Ramsey a yahoo
        and compared him to Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker in a column
        published in the monthly Nashville Business in Review. </p>
        <p>''You cannot get a haircut over the phone and you
        cannot get financial advice over the radio,'' Carden
        wrote. </p>
        <p>Ramsey disagrees. </p>
        <p>''I don't have to do a full financial plan to know you
        need to be out of debt,'' he said. </p>

        <p><font size="5">W</font>ith as many as 1,400 drug
        addicts and alcoholics losing their federal disability
        checks this month, Calvin Taylor expects to be busy soon.
        </p>
        <p>''I expect the impact not to really hit until February
        or March. I expect at that point probably a 25 to 35
        percent increase in people demanding, wanting services,''
        said Taylor, who oversees a variety of programs for the
        homeless, addicts, poor families and others as director
        of the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee's
        Homeward Bound program. </p>
        <p>He and others who work with substance abusers don't
        expect addicts to suddenly get themselves straight nor do
        they expect the federal government to pour new money into
        treatment programs. </p>
        <p>The company that's been managing the drug and alcohol
        caseload for the Social Security Administration will no
        longer do so. </p>
        <p>Maximus RMA, a for-profit social-service agency based
        in Vienna, Va., started monitoring cases in 30 states in
        1994 and was working in 44 states by September 1995. </p>
        <p>Maximus subcontracted with area agencies to do case
        management -- to interview clients individually, refer
        them to treatment and track their progress in treatment. </p>
        <p>The firm handled 135,000 cases nationwide and 9,700 in
        Tennessee. It closed 98,700 cases, including 7,000 in
        Tennessee, for non-compliance, death or successful
        completion of treatment. </p>
        <p>''To the extent the program was successful, it was
        successful because there was a sanction, because there
        was a motivating factor to the client to remain in
        treatment,'' said Bob Muzzio, project director for
        Maximus. </p>
        <p>Exactly what efforts will be made to get people into
        treatment if they start collecting disability for another
        ailment remains unclear. </p>
        <p>''If the law made sense to start with, it still makes
        sense regardless of whether they've been certified for a
        different problem or not,'' Muzzio said. ''The
        substance-abuse problem is still going to be there.'' </p>
        <p>State and local officials said they've heard more
        treatment money is coming -- the state Bureau of Alcohol
        and Drug Abuse Services has been told informally it could
        expect an extra $827,000 -- but details are sketchy. </p>
        <p>''We don't know specifically what we're going to do as
        yet,'' said Dr. Stephanie Perry, the assistant state
        health commissioner who runs the bureau. </p>
        <p>''We don't have a clear-cut answer in terms of the
        amount of money as yet. We anticipate that we'll have to
        get analysis of the numbers of individuals involved and
        determine what the need for treatment will be for those
        individuals. We will probably have to go through an
        educational process . . . reaching out to these
        individuals.'' </p>
        <p>That puts the burden on local providers, and working
        together will be important. </p>
        <p>''Those folks will just start showing up in other
        systems, not only our own, but in the emergency room and
        in the jail and in different places like that, to access
        resources,'' said Jon Michael, deputy director of
        DRI-Dock, which runs Knoxville's public inebriate
        program. </p>
        <p>''Until we get to a place where we can work together
        and find some coordinated, logical means of dealing with
        folks so that we know what's going on elsewhere in the
        community so everyone is approaching the problem and
        singing from the same sheet, we're probably going to be
        wasting our money to some degree.'' </p>
        <p>TennCare Partners, which provides health coverage for
        mental problems and substance abuse, may pick up some
        clients, although Taylor said in-patient care is
        ''virtually impossible to get.'' </p>
        <p>''The expectation for most (addicts) is that they can
        do it through an outpatient program,'' Taylor said. ''But
        we've learned through treatment that an effective
        in-patient treatment program requires at least a 30-day
        hospitalization and then intensive after care with
        halfway house service for another six months.'' </p>
        <p>The Knoxville Coalition for the Homeless plans to ask
        the Red Cross to help set up extra shelter facilities at
        a church, Taylor said, in anticipation of those who lose
        their housing when their checks stop. </p>
        <p>''In a sense, government created its own problem, as
        it so regularly does, by developing the whole system'' of
        giving drug and alcohol checks,'' Taylor said. ''But to
        then just take it away, you're creating a new, different
        problem. It's just going from one problem to another
        problem instead of to a solution.'' </p>

</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Marti Davis, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>ction by Congress last month will result in a $1.5 million windfall for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1997, park officials said.
<P>   In prior years all but a small proportion of fees collected in parks had to be deposited into the General Federal Treasury. The &#39;&#39;Recreation Fee Demonstration Project&#39;&#39; will allow the park to keep 80 percent of the increase in campground fees, which were planned for this year before the new legislation had been approved by Congress, said Ranger Bob Miller.
<P>   Most parks that charged entrance fees have raised fees for 1997.
<P>   There is no truth to a news story originating in North Carolina reporting the Great Smoky Mountains National Park would begin collecting a $2 entry fee in 1997, Miller said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know where they got that,&#39;&#39; said Miller, who said the story had generated inquiries from newspapers, radio and television stations throughout the area. The park has no current plans to institute an entrance fee, Miller stressed.
<P>   The Great Smoky Mountains made its first significant fee-based income in December, when $1,000 was collected from visitors who paid $7 for Saturday morning hayrides around Cades Cove. About $2 of each fee collected was kept by the park for improvements in Cades Cove.
<P>   Income to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park from newly increased camping fees is expected to reach about $400,000 in 1997, said Miller.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Under park service policy, camping fees are periodically adjusted to reflect changing rates for camping in commercial facilities outside the park,&#39;&#39; said Park Superintendent Karen Wade.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Camping fees in the Smokies have not been raised since 1991. Fortunately, when we raise our rates this time, the new revenue will provide us with an estimated $400,000 in badly needed funding,&#39;&#39; Wade said.
<P>   The additional money will go into a park renewal fund that will be made available to parks to improve their facilities and operations. Park officials expect to use the money to refurbish deteriorating facilities. Officials also want to expand camping opportunities by reopening some camping areas closed last season and extending operational periods of others. They expect to put some money aside toward replacement of the park&#39;s 18-year-old orientation film shown at Sugarlands Visitor Center.
<P>   The new nightly campsite rates will be effective when the park&#39;s seasonal campgrounds open in March.
<P>   They are Big Creek and Cataloochee, $10; Deep Creek and Balsam Mountain, $12 without reservation and $15 with reservations.
<P>    The park&#39;s three most popular campgrounds, Elkmont, Smokemont and Cades Cove require advance reservations during the period May 15 through Oct. 30 and operate on a first-come, first-served basis outside that period.
<P>   Reservations can be made up to five months before arrival starting Jan. 15, 1997 by calling 1-800-365-CAMP.

        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">I</font>n the face of music industry
        bankruptcies and dwindling profit margins, a Knoxville
        company is holding its own and expanding. </p>
        <p>The Disc Exchange was founded in 1987 in South
        Knoxville by Allan Miller Jr., then a University of
        Tennessee graduate student in clinical nutrition, and
        Jennie Jenkins, an accountant. </p>
        <p>They started the business with 30 CDs from their own
        collection. Today, the Disc Exchange has two locations
        with 104,000 CDs, and 43 full- and part-time employees.
        Both stores are equipped with listening bars, some of the
        first in the area, an opportunity to let customers listen
        to music before purchasing. </p>
        <p>''It is pretty amazing,'' said Miller. ''Thinking
        back, it's like a galaxy far, far away. It's nothing that
        we planned for. We were just doing it on the side. </p>
        <p>''The whole purpose was to get CDs inexpensively,'' he
        said. ''We weren't at all interested in starting a record
        store with records and cassettes. We didn't care about
        them. The whole point was to get more CDs.'' </p>
        <p>Its selections span nearly any musical genre --
        R&amp;B, rap, classical, jazz, new age, rock, Celtic, and
        heavy metal. It's widely known among music lovers as a
        place to buy, sell or trade CDs. </p>
        <p>''I never worked in a music store,'' said Miller. ''I
        just really enjoy music. By not having worked in one, I
        think I came in with fresh ideas and different
        perceptions from the way things should be done.'' </p>
        <p>The Disc Exchange's south location at 2615 Chapman
        Highway recently doubled in size, from about 6,000 square
        feet to 12,550 square feet. With its newly acquired
        space, the store expanded its selections of CDs, books,
        magazines, and T-shirts, added a country/bluegrass
        listening room, and increased its storage area. It
        already has a classical listening room. Also added was a
        stage for performances by local and touring bands. A new
        listening bar is under construction. </p>
        <p>The 8,400-square-foot location in West Knoxville at
        8420 Kingston Pike opened in September 1994, also will
        receive an enlarged listening bar. </p>
        <p>It also has opened a Game Exchange room, for buying,
        selling and trading Sega Genesis and Saturn, Super
        Nintendo, Sony Playstation, Nintendo Ultra 64 and CD-ROM
        computer games. </p>
        <p>The business will soon be setting up monitors and game
        stations so customers can sample games. </p>
        <p>''We're always looking for the opportunity to grow,''
        said Scott Partin, the company's vice president of
        operations who came on board about five years ago. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, business has been less kind to some music
        retailers. </p>
        <p>The decline has struck locally -- Lynn's Disc and Dat,
        Raven Records, Blues Depot, Underdog and Big Beat all
        have closed in Knoxville. </p>
        <p>Why has the Disc Exchange survived? </p>
        <p>''We take the money and put it back into the
        business,'' said Miller. ''We don't take home what some
        people might expect. </p>
        <p>''I think there was a window of opportunity that
        opened and closed,'' he added. ''We happened to be there
        at the right time.'' </p>
        <p>It's a business with humble beginnings. </p>
        <p>Jenkins and Miller wanted to have the latest CDs, but
        didn't want to pay full price for them. They pooled their
        collection, and posted a list around campus of the CDs
        they had to trade. A phone number was included so those
        interested could call and get on a mailing list. </p>
        <p>Since CDs were not yet a common household product --
        they were introduced for the mass market in 1983 --
        business was slow. </p>
        <p>''It took a lot for someone with a wall of albums to
        buy a CD player and start playing CDs,'' said Miller. </p>
        <p>In the beginning, the pair took orders, and Miller
        hand delivered CDs. Customers could also trade CDs. </p>
        <p>Soon enough, it proved to be too much. </p>
        <p>Miller and Jenkins began displaying their CDs in the
        old Parkway Video store on Old Martin Mill Pike. In turn,
        they advertised the store on campus. </p>
        <p>After more than a year, the stock outgrew that
        location, and the Disc Exchange formally set up on
        Chapman Highway. </p>
        <p>''I think my friends really did think I was crazy,''
        said Miller. ''That store was 6,000 square feet and for
        the inventory we had . . . We came up with the idea of
        having movable walls that were made of Styrofoam. As we
        needed more space, we would back the wall up.'' </p>
        <p>Miller worked there; Jenkins dropped by at night after
        getting off from her full-time job. The only other
        part-time help was a UT student. </p>
        <p>The Disc Exchange has lenient trade and return
        policies -- all the more to encourage people to listen to
        many types of music. </p>
        <p>''One big advantage of the business is turning people
        on to new music,'' said Miller. ''It gives people a
        chance to experiment and discover.'' </p>
        <p>The stores will buy nearly any CD -- as long as it
        doesn't have too many of the same thing already stocked
        and it's in good shape. </p>
        <p>A CD can be returned or swapped for another after 10
        days if a customer decides he doesn't like it. </p>

        biggest event of all -- the Olympics. </p>
        <p>Now, the rewards just won't stop coming. </p>
        <p>The first U.S. woman to win four gold medals in a
        single Olympics, Van Dyken has parlayed her swimming
        success into a broad-based commercial campaign. </p>
        <p>In a close vote dominated by the stars of the Summer
        Games, she was selected Tuesday as The Associated Press
        female athlete of the year. </p>
        <p>Balloting by The AP's print and broadcast members gave
        Van Dyken 191 points and 45 of the 165 first-place votes.
        Second was another Olympic gold medalist, gymnast <b>Kerri
        Strug,</b> with 34 first-place votes and 159 points,
        followed by tennis star <b>Steffi &127;Graf,</b> with 27
        first-place votes and 142 points. </p>
        <p>Now back in training, Van Dyken will resume
        competition in an age-group meet in Indianapolis in
        January. She wants to compete in the next world
        championships in Perth, Australia, in January 1998, but
        won't commit yet to another big meet Down Under -- the
        2000 Olympics in Sydney. </p>
        <h3>College football</h3>
        <p>* Alabama offensive line coach <b>Jim Fuller &127;</b>will
        have his contract bought out by the university. Fuller,
        51, a member of the Alabama staff since 1984, was told by
        incoming coach <b>Mike Dubose </b>that he would not be
        retained next season. </p>
        <h3>College basketball</h3>
        <p>* Tennessee Lady Vols' point guard <b>Laurie
        &127;Milligan</b> has a capsular sprain of the left knee
        joint, but might not miss any playing time. Milligan, who
        injured her knee in Sunday's 77-75 loss at Arkansas, is
        listed as probable for Thursday's game at St. Joseph's in
        Philadelphia. </p>
        <p>* <b>Kenny Pratt </b>was reinstated to the Iowa State
        team after appealing his suspension to a university
        committee. Pratt was suspended following a weekend tussle
        with police, but will be allowed to play until the
        charges are settled. </p>
        <h3>College baseball</h3>
        <p>* Tennessee is ranked No. 17 in the preseason college
        poll as determined by the staff of Baseball America
        magazine. Stanford is ranked No. 1, followed by Florida
        State, Southern Cal, Miami and UCLA. Mississippi State is
        the top-ranked SEC team at No. 9; defending national
        champion LSU is No. 11; Florida is No. 15 and Alabama No.
        19. </p>
        <h3>NFL</h3>
        <p>* Police in a San Francisco suburb are investigating a
        woman's report that she was sexually assaulted by a
        Philadelphia Eagles player in a hotel room late Saturday
        night or early Sunday morning. A police spokesman said
        the charge is being investigated and the player was not
        identified. </p>
        <p>* Pittsburgh Steelers running back <b>Jerome
        &127;Bettis,</b> still limping on a sore right ankle he
        initially hurt a month ago, probably won't practice this
        week and is questionable for the Steelers' divisional
        playoff game Sunday at New England. Receiver <b>Yancey
        Thigpen</b>, who has a stress fracture in his foot,
        likely is out for the rest of the playoffs. </p>
        <p>* Running back <b>Natrone Means </b>of the
        Jacksonville Jaguars and safety <b>George &127;Teague </b>and
        kicker <b>Chris Boniol </b>of the Dallas Cowboys are the
        offensive, defensive and special teams players of the
        week for the NFL wild-card playoff games. </p>
        <h3>Soccer</h3>
        <p>* The Knoxville Stars under-16 girls team finished
        third in a 32-team field in the Miami (Fla.) Junior
        Orange Bowl tournament with a 5-1 record. The victories
        came over teams from New Jersey, Alabama and Florida.
        Their only loss came to a team from Dallas. </p>
        <h3>College football</h3>
        <p>* Ohio State offensive tackle <b>Orlando Pace,</b> who
        said in early December that he would return to the
        Buckeyes next year, is hedging on that statement. ''I
        said I'd reconsider it,'' he said before a Rose Bowl
        practice in Pasadena, Calif. ''It's not set in stone or
        anything like that.'' </p>
        <p>* Among the players declaring for the NFL draft on
        Tuesday: Clemson defensive end <b>Trevor Pryce,</b> Miami
        safety <b>Tremain Mack &127;</b>and defensive end <b>Kenard
        Lang </b>and California second-team All-American tight
        end <b>Tony Gonzalez</b>. </p>
        <h3>Boxing</h3>
        <p>* Seventeen days after losing a second fight to <b>Riddick
        Bowe </b>because of low blows, heavyweight <b>Andrew
        Golota </b>arrived in his native Poland to stand trial
        for a 1990 disco brawl. He is charged with assault and
        robbery and fled Poland days after charges were filed
        against him. He has lived in Chicago since 1991. </p>
        <h3>Horse racing</h3>
        <p>* The Douglas County Board voted to sell 140 acres of
        the county-owned Aksarben racetrack grounds to First Data
        Resources for an office complex and university science
        campus. The 6-1 vote ends horse racing at Nebraska's
        largest track, and jeopardizes horse racing at the other
        four tracks. </p>

<!--FIRST STORY TEMPLATE-->        <font size="6"><b>Officials to Sundquist: 'Sue EPA'</b></font><br>
        <font size="5"><br>
        3 counties join forces against Champion</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Wesley Loy, News-Sentinel staff
        writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">S</font>EVIERVILLE -- Government officials
        joined business advocates from three counties Monday to
        give Gov. Don Sundquist a challenge: Sue the
        Environmental Protection Agency. </p>
        <p>The EPA, they charged, is shirking its duty by
        allowing the Champion International Corp. paper mill to
        continue polluting the Pigeon River, which flows into
        Tennessee. </p>
        <p>If the EPA won't get tough on the North Carolina mill,
        then the state must get tough on the EPA, the panelists
        in Sevierville said. </p>
        <p>''It's always been, really, an open sewer,'' Cocke
        County Executive Harold Cates said of the river. ''It's
        been terrible.'' </p>
        <p>If Tennessee doesn't sue the EPA, then Cocke County
        might, Cates said. </p>
        <p>''I am confident that Gov. Sundquist is going to do
        everything within his power to clean this river up,''
        said Sevier County Executive Larry Waters, who helped
        organize Monday's event. </p>
        <p>But a Champion spokesman said Monday he doubts
        Tennessee will actually sue the EPA. </p>
        <p>''I don't expect it to happen,'' said Champion's
        Tucker Hill. </p>
        <p>He said once Tennessee officials fully weigh
        everything the EPA did in recently approving the mill's
        new permit, the Tennesseans will conclude, as did North
        Carolina officials, that the permit ''is stricter than
        what they may have thought.'' </p>
        <p>Monday's meeting seemed evidence that the Champion
        matter is at long last rising from colloquial complaint
        to a major feud pitting state vs. state and the
        Tennesseans vs. the feds. </p>
        <p>Indeed, on Monday a statement was issued by Vice
        President Al Gore, a former Tennessee senator and devout
        environmentalist criticized for his seeming reticence on
        the Champion issue. </p>
        <p>Gore's statement reads in full: </p>
        <p>''I am pleased that the State of Tennessee has filed a
        formal objection to North Carolina's issuance of the
        permit and variance regarding Champion International and
        the Pigeon River. I have personally asked Environmental
        Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner to
        thoroughly and carefully review this objection and take
        appropriate action. I remain concerned about the state of
        the Pigeon River, and my goal is to help ensure the
        public health and a safe environment for the citizens of
        Tennessee.'' </p>
        <p>Last Thursday the EPA approved North Carolina's new
        permit for Champion allowing the mill to continue
        polluting the Pigeon River at a level above what is
        allowed under federal water quality standards. </p>
        <p>Champion says it has made costly strides in reducing
        pollutants, but critics say the permit only allows years
        more abuse. </p>
        <p>The river is clear when it reaches the mill at Canton,
        N.C., but is turned brown by discharges. The river flows
        37 miles before entering Cocke County, Tenn. From there,
        the river water enters Douglas Lake, the French Broad
        River and then the Tennessee River, which starts near
        Knoxville. </p>
        <p>Opponents of the Champion mill say it has, for 88
        years, stood as a menace to health and recreational
        business opportunities for several East Tennessee
        counties. </p>
        <p>The showing of politicians, county executives and
        chamber of commerce officials from three counties --
        Cocke, Jefferson and Sevier -- is a turning point in the
        fight against Champion, said Bob Seay, executive director
        of the Newport/Cocke County Chamber of Commerce. </p>
        <p>''It's taken 10 years for it to leave our borders,''
        he said. ''It's just been us fighting everybody.'' </p>
        <p>Others attending Monday included Pigeon Forge
        commercial property owner Charles ''Z'' Buda and David
        Jenkins, conservation director with the American Canoe
        Association. </p>
        <p>All watched video snippets of the paper mill and
        polluted stretches of the Pigeon River. Organizers also
        presented a list of 46 business and sporting
        organizations from several states united as the Coalition
        for a Clean Pigeon River. </p>

        Dave Ramsey has seen the top of the money heap -- and the
        bottom. </p>
        <p>Ten years ago, Ramsey possessed all the trappings of
        immense success. He tooled around Nashville in a Jaguar.
        He and his wife Sharon wore designer suits, owned a boat
        and vacationed in Hawaii. </p>
        <p>At 26 years old, the Maryville native and University
        of Tennessee graduate wheeled and dealed in real estate.
        He had $4 million in holdings until the bank, under new
        ownership, called in $1.2 million in short-term loans. A
        second bank followed suit, calling in an additional
        $800,000. </p>
        <p>Overnight Ramsey was broke. By 1988, he was bankrupt. </p>
        <p>''I built a house of cards and I built it poorly,''
        Ramsey reflects. ''I brought myself down by not knowing
        how to handle money. I didn't control it; it controlled
        me.'' </p>
        <p>But from the ashes of his own financial disaster rose
        an opportunity to help other couples deal with
        overspending, with buying on credit, with establishing a
        spending plan and sticking to it. </p>
        <p>The same year he declared bankruptcy he established a
        consulting firm to help people stop foreclosures on their
        property. He began counseling couples in need of
        financial help at his church. Soon he was conducting
        financial seminars for churches and businesses; next he
        put his advice in a self-published book called
        ''Financial Peace.'' </p>
        <p>Last year, thanks in part to promotion from his
        Nashville radio show ''The Money Game,'' Ramsey's book
        was a top seller in Tennessee. Since then, Viking Penguin
        publishers picked ''Financial Peace'' up for national
        distribution and ''The Money Game'' began radio
        syndication. It airs locally on radio station WATO-Oak
        Ridge, (AM-1290) from 2 to 5 p.m. weekdays. </p>
        <p>Lots of Americans share the bad habits that got Ramsey
        into financial trouble. According to statistics compiled
        for ''Financial Peace:'' </p>
        <p><img src="../../images/logos/resolvelogo.gif"
        align="right" hspace="7" vspace="7" width="177"
        height="203">The average American has less than $1,000 in
        the bank and is more than $38,000 in debt. </p>
        <p>Mortgage debt has increased 300 percent since 1975 and
        foreclosures are up 25 percent in three years. </p>
        <p>Total consumer debt was $1.3 trillion in 1980; it is
        more than $3.3 trillion now. </p>
        <p>American will charge $10 billion worth of groceries to
        their credit cards this year. </p>
        <p>''Our grandparents thought debt was bad; our
        great-grandparents thought it was a sin,'' Ramsey says of
        Americans' changing attitudes. ''Our parents began using
        debt pretty heavily with mortgages and car payments; Baby
        Boomers will use credit for $1.57 at the Rocky Top. </p>
        <p>''We (Ramsey's financial consulting group) have been
        real successful at shaking people out of that mindset.'' </p>
        <p>Ramsey advises people to get a grip on overspending,
        starting by cutting up their credit cards. He offers
        seven ''baby steps'' toward financial peace, which he
        preceeds with one caveat: </p>
        <p>''Start with giving (money to the needy or your
        church); it's essential to emotional and spiritual
        health. People who don't give don't prosper. Their
        creativity and productivity are stopped up. Healthy
        people are more unselfish.'' </p>
        <p><b>Baby Step One: </b>Pay minimum payments on all
        debts and put $1,000 in the bank as quickly as you can,
        say within a month, Ramsey advises. This is the start of
        an emergency fund so that when the car breaks down or the
        heat pump goes kapoot, you won't need to go further into
        debt to fix them. </p>
        <p>So how do you stockpile so much so quickly? ''It's a
        matter of priorities,'' says Ramsey. ''Don't order pizza.
        Sell something in the bargain mart. Have a garage sale.
        Take an extra job. Do whatever it takes to get away from
        the edge. </p>
        <p>''It's an emotional decision rather than a
        mathematical decision, and it requires a certain
        intensity level,'' Ramsey admits. ''If your kid was sick,
        could you find $1,000 in month? You bet! That's the
        intensity I'm talking about.'' </p>
        <p><b>Baby Step Two:</b> Kill all debt except your home
        mortgage. ''Getting out of debt isn't rocket science;
        it's getting mad enough to change your behavior
        permanently. Cut up the cards. Do not borrow money for
        any reason. Most of the things we've decided are needs
        are really wants,'' Ramsey says. ''If the old clunker
        breaks down, fix it.'' </p>
        <p>He advises his clients to list all their debts from
        smallest to largest, regardless of the interest rates on
        the loans. Pay the minimum payment on everything but the
        smallest one and attack it with the same vengence you did
        gathering savings in step one. Once that one's paid,
        tackle the next one down, applying the money you had been
        using on the smallest debt toward it. Each time you
        eliminate a debt, the payment you can put toward the next
        is even larger. ''It works!'' Ramsey insists. </p>
        <p><b>Baby Step Three:</b> With all debt but your
        mortgage gone, it becomes very easy to save money now. So
        finish funding your emergency fund, stockpiling three to
        six months' worth of expenses. </p>
        <p>Ramsey says most couples can get through step three
        within two to three years ''if you're willing to get
        radical, sell the boat and stop saving to your retirement
        fund temporarily. If you just play with it, you'll be 10
        years getting out of debt.'' </p>
        <p>Which raises a question: what if one spouse wants to
        commit to such an effort and the other one doesn't? </p>
        <p>''What you're really talking about is your value
        systems and when you can come into oneness on your
        approach to money, you find a unity in marriage at a very
        deep level,'' Ramsey says. ''It's one of the biggest
        benefits we didn't even know was there. When people share
        their money decisions, they share their values and their
        fears. People say it's changed their marriage. But
        sometimes it's a real struggle to get to that place.'' </p>
        <p><b>Baby Step Four:</b> Fully fund a 401k or an IRA.
        ''Get serious about it, and save pre-tax dollars,''
        Ramsey says.<b> </b></p>
        <p><b>Baby Step Five: </b>Start a college fund for your
        children. ''Don't guilt trip on college savings until
        you've taken care of retirement,'' Ramsey says. </p>
        <p><b>Baby Step Six: </b>Now it's time to pay off the
        mortgage. ''It may be two, three, even four years to get
        to this step, but when you do, you will be able to knock
        that house debt off very quickly.'' </p>
        <p><b>Baby Step Seven: </b>With no debt and great basic
        savings plans in place, there's nothing left to do but
        build wealth and give it away. </p>
        <p>Ramsey's snazzy Jaguar has since been replaced by a
        1985 Mark VII with 170,000 miles on it. Any designer
        clothes Ramsey and family may wear are bought at
        consignment shops. The boat is history. But that's OK
        with them. </p>
        <p>''It's amazing how much money you're throwing away
        with debt and spending,'' Ramsey says. ''Americans have
        had our hopes stolen. We believe we're always going to be
        in debt, so as long as we are in debt, we might as well
        have some nice stuff.'' </p>
        <p>But Ramsey knows otherwise. </p>
        <p>''Sharon and I can do anything we want to do. We save
        -- and give -- everything we have.'' </p>

        160 refurbishers at Plant 2</b></font><br>
<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Pam Park, News-Sentinel business

        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">P</font>hilips Consumer Electronics Co. is
        discontinuing its refurbishing operations at Plant 2 in
        Greeneville, resulting in the layoff of 160 workers
        during the first quarter of 1997, the company announced
        Monday. </p>
        <p>Plant 2 holds television refurbishing activities and
        some warehousing operations. </p>
        <p>The fate of the building is uncertain. </p>
        <p>Philips representatives say Philips intends to dispose
        of it, but no deal has been struck. </p>
        <p>In addition to the 160 refurbishing workers, about 45
        people work in the parts warehouse at Plant 2. </p>
        <p>Philips plans to gear down refurbishing operations in
        January and conclude them by March. </p>
        <p>In the future, Philips' refurbishing work will be
        handled by Ozark Electronics of Gravette, Ark., and High
        Quality International USA Inc. of Rancho Cucamonga,
        Calif., said spokesman Jayson Hill. </p>
        <p>A decline in product returns and competitive pressures
        in consumer electronics manufacturing led to the decision
        to outsource the work, said Robert Minkhorst, president
        and chief executive officer. </p>
        <p>Separate discussions are taking place regarding the
        parts warehousing operations, Minkhorst said. </p>
        <p>GC Capital, which is a privately owned company, is
        negotiating to buy three or more Philips Greeneville
        operations and run them on a contract basis.<b> </b></p>
        <p>GC Capital has set up separate companies to operate
        the electronics manufacturing plant, the injection
        molding plant and the warehousing/distribution facility. </p>
        <p>All three plants are housed in Plant 3. </p>
        <p>The circuit board plant, located near Plant 3, has not
        been included in the deal because of difficulties in
        putting together such a complex financial package, a
        company principal said recently. </p>
        <p>Other companies have made overtures about buying the
        circuit board plant as well, a Philips spokesman said. </p>

        <font size="5">M</font>ichael Johnson, the man with the
        golden shoes and the Olympic medals to match, dominated
        track and field in 1996 by sprinting to an unprecedented
        double at the Atlanta Games and obliterating the sport's
        oldest record. </p>
        <p>That dominance earned Johnson honors as Male Athlete
        of the Year in an Associated Press poll released Monday.
        Last week, Johnson's sweep of the 200 and 400 was voted
        the AP top sports story of the year. </p>
        <p>Johnson received 300 points in the annual balloting by
        AP print and broadcast members. Golfer Tiger Woods was
        second with 200 points, though he received 11 more
        first-place votes than Johnson. </p>
        <p>Boxer Evander Holyfield (116 points) was third,
        followed by basketball's Michael Jordan (111) and
        football's Brett Favre (41). </p>
        <p>Johnson became the first man to win the 200 and 400
        meters in an Olympics. He broke the 27-year-old record in
        the 200 at the Olympic trials, then shattered his mark
        with an astonishing run of 19.32 seconds at the Summer
        Games. </p>
        <p>And he stretched his victory streak in the 400 to 57
        in a row, remaining unbeaten at that distance since 1989.
        </p>
        <p>Perhaps even more remarkable than his medals and
        records was the aura of invincibility that surrounded
        him. </p>

        <font size="5">S</font>econd of two parts </p>
        <p>Barely a year ago, Dave Straub was a former broadcast
        journalist with a history marked by alcoholism, tax
        problems, bankruptcy and run-ins with the law. </p>
        <p>Now he's the financial and spiritual inspiration
        behind Club Atlanta Travel, a multimillion dollar network
        marketing firm that boasts thousands of sales
        representatives who swear his product is their salvation.
        </p>
        <p>''It's the most successful thing I've ever done,'' he
        said. ''I wouldn't give up the past year for anything.'' </p>
        <p>Founded in November 1995, Straub's Atlanta-based
        corporation has already pulled in revenues of $80
        million. The sales force has blossomed to 18,000
        representatives in the United States and Canada, with
        hundreds in Knoxville. </p>
        <p>The company's premier product is the CAT pass, a
        $1,000 certificate that can be redeemed to buy trips from
        an Atlanta travel agency that posts prices comparable to
        other retail agencies. </p>
        <p>But CAT has encountered as much strife as success in
        its short history. </p>
        <p>North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan and Georgia launched
        investigations against CAT, and Ohio and Michigan have
        concluded this multilevel marketing operation, or MLM, is
        a pyramid scheme. Early participants earn commissions by
        recruiting new members, instead of selling the product.
        Eventually, the pyramid can get too heavy with
        participants for everyone to recoup their investment or
        make money, and the scheme collapses. </p>
        <p>Straub contests the claims, saying some states have
        never understood network marketing. </p>
        <p>The hot retail technique -- best identified with such
        successful companies as Amway household products and Mary
        Kay cosmetics -- sells products direct to the public.
        Sales representatives for MLMs also recruit and train
        sales reps who serve beneath them. </p>
        <p>By mid-1995, Straub had constructed a skeleton plan
        that combined the power of network marketing with the
        lure of travel. </p>
        <p>''You'd have to sell a heck of a lot of lipstick to
        make the same amount of money that you could, with little
        effort, with CAT,'' he said. </p>
        <p>Before he entered the business world, Straub made a
        name for himself as an anchor, reporter and news director
        for television stations across the country, including
        CNN, according to biographical materials supplied by CAT.
        </p>
        <p>In 1988, he made the move to business. His first
        company, Trade Masters, sank to bankruptcy by 1993. He
        started another similar company, Master Trade, and sold
        it shortly before he founded Club Atlanta Travel. </p>
        <p>Friends like Sandy Williams, a paralegal at the
        Atlanta law firm that has represented Straub in business
        and personal affairs, said he's a deeply spiritual and
        ethical man who's had some bad breaks. </p>
        <p>''Their whole family is nice,'' Williams said.
        ''They're good, Christian people.'' </p>
        <p>But Straub's criminal record reveals another
        perspective. In his hometown of Louisville, Ky., the
        then-22-year-old Straub was charged in 1970 with breaking
        into a storehouse. He was sentenced to two, two-year
        terms, served concurrently. </p>
        <p>He racked up a couple of DUI charges in the 1980s and
        entered a substance-abuse program in 1989. Then, in 1990,
        a jury found him guilty of attempting in 1988 to kidnap a
        woman outside a Marietta, Ga., sports club. The arrest
        warrant alleges he grabbed the woman, wrestled with her
        and attempted to force her into her car. </p>
        <p>Straub, who still maintains his innocence in that
        case, was sentenced to one year in prison and four years'
        probation. </p>
        <p>Even while he served time in jail, Straub's first
        business, a bank bartering firm called Trade Masters,
        waited for him. </p>
        <p>Trade Masters began as a bartering agent between
        people who wanted to trade services and goods. For
        example: a plumber might deposit $1,000 worth of his
        services in a Trade Masters account. In exchange, he'd
        receive 1,000 ''trade dollars,'' to be used to purchase
        the services or goods another person had deposited.
        Participants paid a transaction fee to Trade Masters. </p>
        <p>Such bartering firms operate successfully throughout
        the world. But by March 1993, Trade Masters -- which
        court records claim held one of the largest client bases
        of any independent bank bartering exchange -- was in
        financial disarray. </p>
        <p>Upon investigating Trade Masters, bankruptcy trustee
        Skip Klauber concluded in a September 1993 report that
        the company had maintained virtually no accounting system
        and ''suffered through gross mismanagement, perhaps
        bordering on negligent actions taken by its principals.''
        </p>
        <p>In addition to detailing numerous irresponsible
        business practices, U.S. Bankruptcy Court records show
        the firm also owed the IRS $132,759 in back taxes and
        penalties. The violations string from 1989 to 1992,
        practically the firm's entire history. </p>
        <p>If Trade Masters had any hope for the future, Klauber
        concluded, it would begin by ousting Straub and his wife,
        Patricia Straub, president of Trade Masters of Atlanta. </p>
        <p>Instead, the court opted to liquidate the bartering
        bank. When the case was closed in January 1996, the firm
        owed millions. Klauber said most creditors received
        nothing. </p>
        <p>Straub said he can't pretend he didn't make mistakes
        with Trade Masters. He had no business experience when he
        founded the bartering exchange. And he said he tried to
        franchise too early, spreading a young company's
        resources too thin. </p>
        <p>But Straub said he's a different man now. Both he and
        his acquaintances trace the change to the day his son
        suffered a spinal cord injury -- the same day the courts
        forced Trade Masters into bankruptcy. </p>
        <p>''It was a major growing experience for me,'' he said.
        ''It created sobriety, lucidity. It made me come to grips
        with the fact that I had to take responsibility for
        things I had done, in business and otherwise.'' </p>
        <p>But there were more lessons for Straub's family. He
        and his wife filed for bankruptcy protection in December
        1994 in Georgia. The couple owed hundreds of thousands in
        hospital bills for their son and more than $100,000 to
        the IRS in back taxes and penalties. That case closed
        with no distribution to creditors in May 1996. </p>
        <p>Once again, Straub said he was forced to take lessons
        he'd learned from his past failures and started mapping
        plans and seeking investors for his next venture. ''From
        that point on, I was determined to do everything
        better,'' he said. The result: Club Atlanta Travel. </p>

        <p>The holidays aren't even over yet, and already we're
        feeling like fat little pigs. </p>
        <p>We've gulped the eggnog, wolfed the cookies, heaped
        the ham and scooped sweet potato casserole onto our
        plates. Nuts and bolts, Swedish meatballs, cream cheese
        stuff on crackers -- we've eaten every bite. </p>
        <p>And now most of us are thinking about the new year and
        making plans to rid our hips and thighs of our
        overindulgences. Question is, how to do it in a way we
        can stick to long enough to make a difference. </p>
        <p>Gwen Roddye, director of Weight Watchers for East
        Tennessee, advises her clients to take it slow, making
        permanent changes in their diet and exercise programs. </p>
        <p>To lose 10 pounds, for instance, requires that you
        consume 35,000 fewer calories than you have been eating
        -- or that you burn them off with exercise, or,
        preferably, both. Spread that 35,000 calorie figure over
        the course of a year, and you have about 100 calories a
        day to rid yourself of. </p>
        <p>Following are some simple ways Roddye and Margy Wirtz,
        fitness director for the Downtown YMCA, suggest for
        creating that 100 calorie deficit. There are 97 of them,
        in honor of the new year. Pick and choose the ones that
        work best for you: </p>
        <p><strong>1.</strong> Switch from the giant-size burger
        to the junior size at your favorite fast food restaurant.
        Though the savings vary, the difference will likely be
        hundreds of calories. </p>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> Replace a 12-ounce cola with a
        12-ounce diet cola or, better yet, water, and save 149
        calories. </p>
        <p><strong>3.</strong> Use a tablespoon of jelly instead
        of a tablespoon of butter on your toast in the morning
        and save 50 calories. </p>
        <p><strong>4.</strong> Instead of an over-sized 4-ounce
        bagel, have a 2-ounce one and save 160 calories. </p>
        <p><strong>5.</strong> Instead of whole milk (150
        calories per cup), have 2% (120 calories per cup), 1%
        (100 calories per cup), or skim (85 calories per cup). </p>
        <p><strong>6.</strong> Select a 6-ounce roast beef sub
        with mayonnaise instead of a 6-ounce sub with tuna salad
        and save 175 calories. </p>
        <p><strong>7.</strong> Have a small taco instead of a
        large one and save 200 calories. </p>
        <p><strong>8.</strong> Substitute 1/2 cup non-fat ice
        cream for 1/2 cup premium ice cream and save 175
        calories. </p>
        <p><strong>9.</strong> Have a hot dog on a bun instead of
        a corndog and save 220 calories. </p>
        <p><strong>10.</strong> Two slices of regular French
        toast with butter are 120 calories lighter than five
        French toast sticks. </p>
        <p><b>11. </b>Instead of two eggs scrambled the
        old-fashioned way, prepare 1/2 cup egg substitute in a
        non-stick skillet using vegetable oil spray for a
        150-calorie savings. </p>
        <p><b>12.</b> An English muffin with butter is 195
        calories lighter than an English muffin with cheese, egg
        and bacon at the fast food restaurant. </p>
        <p><b>13.</b> Have a ham sandwich with mayo instead of a
        reuben and save 120 calories. </p>
        <p><b>14. </b>Have 1 cup air-popped popcorn instead of 1
        cup caramel popcorn to save 115 calories. </p>
        <p><b>15.</b> Replace a Pina Colada with a 4-ounce glass
        of wine and save 150 calories. </p>
        <p><b>16.</b> One slice of garlic bread is 100 calories
        lighter than three hushpuppies. </p>
        <p><b>17.</b> Have pancakes without butter to save 100
        calories. And instead of saturating them with 1/4 cup
        syrup, pour a tablespoon on your plate and dip each bite
        just to get a taste. You'll save another 150 calories. </p>
        <p><b>18.</b> Use light syrup instead of regular on those
        pancakes and save 100 more calories. </p>
        <p><b>19. </b>A slice of banana nut bread is 150 calories
        less than a 2 1/2-ounce wedge of coffee cake. </p>
        <p><b>20.</b> Opt for bread over a croissant and save 135
        calories. </p>
        <p><b>21.</b> Use three tablespoons of light ranch
        dressing instead of regular and save 150 calories. </p>
        <p><b>22.</b> Remove the skin from a quarter roasted
        chicken before you eat it and save 150 calories. </p>
        <p><b>23.</b> Use 1/4 cup salsa instead of cheese dip
        with your chips and save 100 calories. </p>
        <p><b>24.</b> Eat vegetable strips instead of one ounce
        of chips and save another 160 calories. </p>
        <p><b>25.</b> Two ounces of pretzels have 100 fewer
        calories than two ounces of chips. </p>
        <p><b>26.</b> Trim the fat from a four-ounce steak and
        save 100 or more calories. </p>
        <p><b>27.</b> Order a regular size order of french fries
        instead of ''super-sizing'' and save 250 calories. </p>
        <p><b>28.</b> Save 165 calories when you order a grilled
        chicken sandwich instead of a fried chicken patty
        sandwich. </p>
        <p><b>29.</b> Have two slices of cheese pizza instead of
        the supreme deluxe and save 150 or more calories. </p>
        <p><b>30.</b> Instead of cutting the chocolate cream pie
        into six slices, cut it into eight. Each slice will have
        150 fewer calories. </p>
        <p><b>31.</b> Eat the pie filling and leave the crust and
        save another 100 calories. </p>
        <p><b>32.</b> Have two tablespoons of sour cream instead
        of chili and cheese on your baked potato and save 350
        calories. </p>
        <p><b>33.</b> Choose a fat-free apple bran muffin instead
        of a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit and save 250 calories.
        </p>
        <p><b>34.</b> Eat an apple rather than those peanut
        butter crackers from the vending machine and save 100
        calories. </p>
        <p><b>35.</b> Have tomato sauce instead of meat sauce on
        your pasta and save 100 or more calories. </p>
        <p><b>36. </b>Walk a mile in 20 minutes and burn between
        120 and 200 calories, depending on what you weigh. </p>
        <p><b>37.</b> Thirty minutes of moderate cycling burns
        between 150 and 250 calories. </p>
        <p><b>38.</b> You'll burn between 200 and 300 calories if
        you swim slowly for 30 minutes. </p>
        <p><b>39.</b> Playing singles tennis burns between 150

        <p><b>40.</b> You'll burn between 240 and 400 calories if

        <p><b>42.</b> Mow grass for half an hour (pushing, not
        riding) and burn between 160 and 300 calories. </p>
        <p><b>43. </b>Mop floors for half an hour and burn
        between 100 and 150 calories. </p>
        <p><b>44.</b> Get down on your knees and scrub those same

        <p><b>54.</b> Use a hand basket at the grocery instead of
        a cart. You'll give your arms a workout and cut down on
        how much you buy. </p>
        <p>Though the following tips aren't as specific as those
        above, they will help your weight loss efforts to be
        successful: </p>
        <p><b>55.</b> Be creative with exercise. Put on a CD and
        dance, go for a hike, park at a central location at the
        shopping center and walk. </p>
        <p><b>56.</b> Find someone who's interested in exercising
        with you. It helps keep you motivated. </p>
        <p><b>57.</b> Shop around for a workout facility that
        feels comfortable and appeals to you in its staff and
        clientele. </p>
        <p><b>58.</b> Vary your workouts. </p>
        <p><b>59.</b> Don't forget to work on your flexibility by
        stretching before and after your aerobic workouts. </p>
        <p><b>60.</b> Buy yourself a few sessions with a
        certified, friendly personal trainer and express to him
        or her that you're there to learn so you can do it by
        yourself. </p>
        <p><b>61.</b> Keep a food and activity journal and track
        everything you do. </p>
        <p><b>62. </b>Forget the old saying, ''no pain, no
        gain.'' It doesn't apply to exercise. </p>
        <p><b>63.</b> If you're over 40 and just getting back to
        exercise, have a physical first. </p>
        <p><b>64.</b> Don't ignore aches and pains. They could be
        your body signaling a problem. </p>
        <p><b>65.</b> Exercise at the time of day that feels good
        to you. Midday workouts can help fight the ''afternoon
        slump.'' </p>
        <p><b>66.</b> Be kind to yourself. You will feel better
        if you give yourself a break instead of berating yourself
        for occasional slip-ups. </p>
        <p><b>67.</b> Reward yourself with non-food items: CD's,
        clothes, etc. </p>
        <p><b>68. </b>Don't grocery shop when you're hungry. </p>
        <p><b>69.</b> Don't watch TV or read while you eat, and
        limit your eating to the kitchen or dining room table. </p>
        <p><b>70.</b> Keep tempting food out of sight, hard to
        reach and bothersome to prepare. </p>
        <p><b>71. </b>Keep low-calorie food accessible, visible
        and ready to eat. </p>
        <p><b>72.</b> Give other family members their own places
        to store snack foods. </p>
        <p><b>73.</b> Don't keep tempting foods at your desk or
        near your workplace. </p>
        <p><b>74.</b> Carry no change for the vending machines. </p>
        <p><b>75.</b> Remove leftovers from sight immediately and
        store them in opaque containers. Better yet, ask another
        family member to put them away. </p>
        <p><b>76. </b>Put the fork, sandwich or drink down
        between bites. </p>
        <p><b>77.</b> Swallow what's in your mouth before
        preparing to take another bite. </p>
        <p><b>78.</b> Cut food as it is needed rather than all at
        once. </p>
        <p><b>79.</b> Stop eating a few times during the meal to
        control your eating rhythm and limit how much you eat. </p>
        <p><b>80.</b> Learn to tune in to hunger pangs, and wait
        to truly feel hungry before eating. </p>
        <p><b>81.</b> Use smaller plates, serving spoons, bowls
        and glasses. </p>
        <p><b>82.</b> Avoid buying large sizes of foods you find
        irresistable. </p>
        <p><b>83.</b> When traveling, choose a hotel with an
        exercise facility. Then use it every day. </p>
        <p><b>84.</b> Stand or walk while talking on the phone. A
        cordless phone is great for walking around the house or
        yard. </p>
        <p><b>85.</b> Substitute bowling, miniature golf or a
        stroll in the park for a movie. </p>
        <p><b>86.</b> The next time you walk the dog, walk a
        little faster or a little longer. </p>
        <p><b>87. </b>If you don't have a dog, get one. </p>
        <p><b>88. </b>Throw away your remote control. Get up and
        get your own drink. Focus on moving instead of not
        moving. </p>
        <p><b>89.</b> If your diet makes you feel constantly
        hungry and deprived, you probably need to eat more. You
        may need to suppliment with low calorie choices. </p>
        <p><b>90.</b> Don't use the amount of food on your plate
        as the standard for how much to eat. Pay attention to the
        signals your body gives you about being hungry or full
        and respond to those. </p>
        <p><b>91.</b> It's fine to include an occasional high-fat
        food or dessert; just balance it with lower-calorie
        choices that day or over the next few days. </p>
        <p><b>92.</b> Drink plenty of water. It keeps you feeling
        full and helps your body work most efficiently. Also,
        many people confuse feelings of thirst with hunger. </p>
        <p><b>93.</b> Be aware that fat-free does not mean the
        same as low-calorie. A fat-free cookie may have as many
        calories as a regular cookie. </p>
        <p><b>94. </b>Make changes gradually so they become
        built-in habits. </p>
        <p><b>95.</b> Eat breakfast. Allowing yourself to get too
        hungry leads to overeating later. </p>
        <p><b>96.</b> Take the focus off numbers. It's what you
        do, not what you weigh, that makes you a success. </p>
        <p><b>97.</b> Separate the goal of good health from the
        goal of meeting society's standards for thinness; a
        10-pound loss may not give you the perfect body but it
        will improve your health. </p>

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>World makes elaborate plans for year 2000, still 3 years away</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By The Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>f things seem relatively tame this New Year&#39;s Eve, rest easy -- and rest up.
<P>    Three years from now, the world will romp into an end-of-the-century birthday bash the likes of which have never been seen.
<P>    The planning and the countdown have already begun.
<P>    Concorde flights will touch down in a half-dozen time zones, cruise ships will chug across the international date line to witness the century&#39;s first sunrise, and a stream of cultural, commercial and spiritual extravaganzas will light up the globe.
<P>    Iceland will light bonfires, England plans a nationwide pealing of bells, and Sri Lanka will hold a gigantic beach bash in Colombo on the shores of the Indian Ocean. Brazil also is planning a party in Rio de Janeiro, on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.
<P>    In New York, Times Square will be transformed into a kind of cultural crossroads on Dec. 31, 1999, with giant television screens conveying millennium celebrations from each of the world&#39;s 24 time zones.
<P>    In England -- if British Airways has its way -- a giant Ferris wheel will light up the London skyline.
<P>    And in Dublin, Ireland, a giant digital sunken clock is already ticking down the seconds to the third millennium beneath the murky waters of the River Liffey. The clock will erupt in fireworks at the stroke of midnight on the last day of 1999.
<P>    Even though, technically, the new century won&#39;t begin for another year, the lure and symbolism of the year 2000 is much too seductive for the world to ignore.
<P>    Even the Vatican bowed to emotion over mathematics, declaring 2000 a Jubilee Year -- the church&#39;s 27th since the first in 1300 -- and planning a yearlong celebration expected to attract some 20 million pilgrims to Rome.
<P>    &#39;&#39;There&#39;s no dispute that the new millennium actually begins in the year 2001,&#39;&#39; acknowledges Edward McNally, co-chairman of the Washington-based Millennium Society. &#39;&#39;The dynamics of throwing a birthday party for planet Earth a year early include the magic of seeing the number 1999 turning into 2000 and launching a year of events and celebrations.&#39;&#39;
<P>    A bunch of Yale graduate students founded the Millennium Society in 1979 to plan &#39;&#39;the largest charity fund-raiser in the history of the world.&#39;&#39; Plans include a round-the-globe succession of black-tie parties and concerts at historic sites, including Mount Fuji in Japan, the Great Wall of China and the pyramids in Egypt.
<P>    The goal is to raise $100 million to create a kind of international Rhodes scholarship, said Cathleen Magennis Wyatt, London-based co-chairwoman of the society, which has chapters around the world.
<P>    &#39;&#39;In addition to making money ... and having a hangover, you can also leave behind a significant legacy,&#39;&#39; she says. &#39;&#39;And that legacy is one of learning.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Philanthropy aside, others are simply planning one heck of a bash.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We figure you can&#39;t stop a good party, so we will celebrate the dawn of the new millennium everywhere it dawns,&#39;&#39; says Gretchen Dykstra, president of New York&#39;s Times Square Business Improvement District, which, with great fanfare, began searching for &#39;&#39;The Big Idea&#39;&#39; a year ago. It got about 750 responses from 21 countries.
<P>    As Dykstra describes them, &#39;&#39;one-third were serious, one-third were off-the-wall, and one-third were from the apocalypse crowd who said &#39;don&#39;t bother doing anything, the world won&#39;t be around.&#39;&#39;&#39;
<P>    The more offbeat suggestions included having a spaceship crash through the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and land in Times Square at precisely midnight. Also rejected was a proposal to turn off the lights and ring in the millennium by having Barry Manilow sing, &#39;&#39;It&#39;s just another New Year&#39;s Eve.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The five winners all made the same suggestion: link international revelers by using giant video screens in Times Square to show midnight celebrations as they occur. The highlight will still be the traditional dropping of the ball in Times Square at midnight -- New York time.
<P>    Exactly where the &#39;&#39;real&#39;&#39; new year begins is another problem for those caught up in time wars. Greenwich, England, which is used as the basis of standard time throughout the world, claims the new century officially begins on its stroke of midnight. That argument has few takers in time zones nine hours ahead, where the competition is frenzied to be &#39;&#39;first.&#39;&#39;
<P>    A New Zealand-based Millennium Adventure Co. has already secured the rights to the world&#39;s &#39;&#39;first light&#39;&#39; on the slopes of Mount Hakepa on Pitt Island, just east of the international date line, about 745 miles southeast of Christchurch. A motel on the island says it has had plenty of inquiries, but has not taken any bookings yet.
<P>    On the east coast of New Zealand&#39;s North Island, meanwhile, the city of Gisborne is organizing a Mardi Gras festival and billing itself as the &#39;&#39;First City in the World to See the Sun.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Other islands, including the Kingdom of Tonga and the Republic of Kiribati in the South Pacific, are also pitching themselves as the first places on the planet to usher in the next 1,000 years.
<P>    Just west of the date line, Western and American Samoa are banking on their own share of millennium madness. As the last places on earth to dust off 1999, they&#39;re hoping tourists will come to the islands not to celebrate the new century, but to bid farewell to the old.

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Colts not so frisky against Steelers</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By The Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT>ITTSBURGH -- There are no miracles left in the Indianapolis Colts, and still no way for them to win in Pittsburgh. The playoffs are back, and so are the Steelers.
<P>    The Steelers didn&#39;t let the Colts hang around until the last play as they did in the AFC Championship game last season, finishing them off much earlier behind Jerome Bettis&#39; running and Kordell Stewart&#39;s playmaking to win 42-14 Sunday.
<P>    Saving their best for the postseason, just as the Cowboys did Saturday in beating up on Minnesota 40-15, the Steelers -- losers of three of four down the stretch -- travel to New England for a divisional playoff game Sunday.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The NFL is always, &#39;What have you done lately?&#39; and a lot of people were counting us out, jumping off the bandwagon,&#39;&#39; defensive end Brentson Buckner said. &#39;&#39;But the last time I looked, we&#39;re still the defending AFC champions, and now let&#39;s see what we can do,&#39;&#39;
<P>    The Steelers&#39; offense was an unpredictable as the sunny, 56-degree weather in late December, as quarterback Mike Tomczak was alternately terrific and terrible. His passes to Charles Johnson were largely responsible for the Steelers&#39; quick 13-0 lead, but he threw two interceptions that gave the momentum and a 14-13 halftime lead to the Colts, who are 0-10 in Three Rivers Stadium.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I know what people were saying, &#39;Oh, it&#39;s going to be another dramatic finish, the Colts are going to hang on,&#39;&#39; said Johnson, who made five catches for 109 yards. &#39;&#39;Uhh, nope. Look somewhere else. We weren&#39;t going to let that happen again.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Not with the Colts limited to only 22 yards while being outscored 29-0 in the second half. Jim Harbaugh, who nearly beat the Steelers with a last-play desperation pass in January, needed 15-20 stitches to close a gash on his jaw and chipped a tooth while going 12-for-32 for 134 yards and an interception.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We knew they had a great defense. They&#39;re No. 2 in the NFL, you know,&#39;&#39; Harbaugh said. &#39;&#39;We made it interesting for a while, we fought and scratched in the first half, but after that . . .&#39;&#39;
<P>    One quarterback couldn&#39;t finish off the Colts, but two could as Stewart finished what Tomczak started in the first quarter, running for two touchdowns -- one in each half -- and 48 yards.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s the playoffs, and you&#39;ve got to check your ego at the door,&#39;&#39; said Tomczak, who was 13-for-21 for 176 yards despite the two interceptions. &#39;&#39;If I had a problem with (the QB rotation), I&#39;d say so, but it&#39;s the playoffs, and we&#39;ll do whatever it takes to get back to the Super Bowl.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Bettis, who guesses his sore ankle is only 80 percent healed, scored on the Steelers&#39; first two drives of the second half as the Steelers kept the ball for all but 1:59 of the third quarter. The second score came after Pro Bowl safety Carnell Lake recovered a fumble on a bad pitch after appearing to distract the Colts by inadvertently jumping offside.
<P>    Bettis rushed for 102 yards.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I thought he jumped . . . but there were a lot of points scored, so I can&#39;t blame the whole ballgame on that,&#39;&#39; Colts coach Lindy Infante said.
<P>    It would have been even worse if Tomczak, who was 5-for-5 on the Steelers&#39; go-ahead drive to start the third quarter, hadn&#39;t slipped back into the slump that dogged him throughout the second half of the season.

        Sales operation raising eyebrows</font></p>

        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">F</font>irst of two parts </p>
        <p>Every week, the Rev. Tommy Patterson bounds to the
        front of a crowded hotel meeting room, whips around and
        delivers his message of hope, salvation and redemption. </p>
        <p>Extending his hands, he invites newcomers and old
        faithfuls to join him on the path to a better life. </p>
        <p>''This is the most exciting multilevel marketing
        program in the country,'' Patterson exclaims, his booming
        preacher's voice carrying to stir the audience. ''I'm not
        talking about vitamins, soap suds or potato chips. We're
        selling the CAT Pass!'' </p>
        <p>A local Church of God preacher and independent
        representative for Club Atlanta Travel, Patterson
        launches into his 30-minute presentation cum pep rally.
        He offers charts, testimonials and a videotaped message
        of encouragement from CAT's founder and chief executive
        officer, Dave Straub. </p>
        <p>In its 14-month history, this Atlanta-based multilevel
        marketing operation, or MLM, has raked in revenues of $80
        million and built a sales force of 18,000 representatives
        in the United States and Canada. Tennessee is home to
        more than 1,100 reps and counting. More than 200 are in
        Knoxville alone. </p>
        <p>Multilevel marketing is a hot business frontier that
        depends on word-of-mouth to build teams of
        representatives who sell direct to the public and
        continue adding reps to the team. </p>
        <p>Where a popular MLM like Amway sells household
        cleaning products or Mary Kay sells cosmetics, Club
        Atlanta Travel sells the CAT pass, a $1,000 certificate
        designed to buy regular-priced travel through an Atlanta
        travel agency that deals exclusively with CAT. </p>
        <p>And while true believers like Patterson and Straub
        extol this MLM as a legitimate way to travel and make
        money, others, notably consumer officials in four states,
        aren't so sure. </p>
        <p>Kristine Lanning, an associate attorney general in
        North Carolina, is one of the skeptics. </p>
        <p>''We had information from many sources indicating that
        they had violated our pyramid statute,'' Lanning said. </p>
        <p>In a pyramid scheme, early participants earn money or
        commissions by recruiting new members, not necessarily
        through product sales. Eventually, the pyramid can get
        too heavy with participants for everyone to recoup their
        investment or make money, and the scheme collapses. </p>
        <p>She and her colleagues in the consumer affairs
        division investigated CAT this summer after they received
        calls from people considering joining the club. By
        August, she presented her findings to CAT officials and
        issued an ultimatum: leave the state or go to court. </p>
        <p>CAT officials signed a consent order in August
        agreeing to shut down operations in North Carolina. The
        consent order is not an admission of wrongdoing, and CAT
        has the option of returning with a new plan. </p>
        <p>Tennessee officials have been alerted to additional
        probes of CAT in Ohio, Michigan and Georgia. </p>
        <p>Knox County Assistant District Attorney Jeff Blevins
        said such referrals generally pass from the DA's office
        to the state attorney general's Consumer Affairs
        division. </p>
        <p>Sharon Curtis Fleer, public information officer for
        the state attorney general, said her office had no
        comment. </p>
        <p>The allegations and investigations are nothing new to
        Straub. He said many states just don't understand MLMs,
        but he's willing to fight to make sure they do. </p>
        <p>''Historically, we've been plagued by the same problem
        throughout this (network marketing) industry,'' he said.
        ''They tend to lump together everything from Amway to
        clearly illegal companies that operate like chain
        letters.'' </p>
        <p>Patterson runs into his share of suspicion as he
        delivers CAT presentations across the country. This local
        used-car salesman and Church of God minister is
        determined to give people a reason to believe. </p>
        <p>''It's been my salvation,'' he tells a gathering at
        the Holiday Inn-Cedar Bluff one recent Tuesday night. </p>
        <p>If you work hard at selling the $1,000 pass, Patterson
        says, you could make $2,500 a week in cash and travel. </p>
        <p>Representatives say the most popular way to start is
        by making a $500 down payment on a CAT pass, plus a $99
        processing fee. You can start with $99, but the
        restrictions are tighter. </p>
        <p>Once you've made your down payment, you've got the
        makings for a travel marketing center or TMC. </p>
        <p>To activate your center, Patterson says, establish and
        train two teams of independent representatives, each of
        whom generates sales and recruits even more sales reps.
        If your teams hit $5,000 each in sales, you get $2,500 in
        cash and travel. Or start seven travel marketing centers
        with a $3,599 down payment and pull in as much as $17,500
        a week in cash and travel. </p>
        <p>''It's like growing a church,'' Patterson tells his
        audience. ''Jesus sent his disciples out two by two. You
        develop your downline (the marketing teams under a rep)
        two by two. You can't come in and not get anyone else
        involved. If you're not going to work and share the
        program, then you should keep your money.'' </p>
        <p>He finally assures listeners: ''This is the most
        outstanding opportunity I've ever seen, outside of being
        a Christian. I want you to be blessed.'' </p>
        <p>But can any program deliver blessings like this? </p>
        <p>Michael Allen said he always wondered, even as he
        wrote out a check for nearly $600 -- the downpayment for
        his first CAT pass. </p>
        <p>''I did it as a favor to a friend,'' Allen said. </p>
        <p>Within days of handing over his money, he said, he
        changed his mind. </p>
        <p>''A lot of people seem to be making a lot of money,''
        he said. ''But if it looks too good to be true, it
        usually is.'' </p>
        <p>Allen resigned immediately. </p>
        <p>Although the company has a money back guarantee, he
        said he didn't accept it. </p>
        <p>Representatives say it takes daring and foresight to
        leap into CAT. Gathered one afternoon for a group
        interview, several local CAT reps agreed they're glad
        they took the plunge. </p>
        <p>''I had been reading about the success of MLMs,'' said
        Terry Patton, who entered the program in August. ''Not
        one of them would pay enough to make me spend time at
        it.'' </p>
        <p>But he smiles across the table at Tommy Patterson, the
        representative who introduced him to the program. </p>
        <p>''I trusted Tommy,'' he said. </p>
        <p>Patton said his trust has paid off. He's had CAT
        banners flying from airplanes at University of Tennessee
        football games. He's got ads in local newspapers. And
        he's got a spreadsheet that diagrams his hundreds of
        thousands of dollars in sales since August. </p>
        <p>Patton has earned sales commissions totaling $90,000
        cash and more than $60,000 in free CAT passes, mostly
        through multiple sales to people also interested in
        becoming representatives and establishing their own
        marketing centers. </p>
        <p>He and his wife maintain their work as real-estate
        agents for Volunteer Realty, but he said CAT has made it
        possible for them to buy a new home and enjoy travel and
        comfort they never imagined. </p>
        <p>The representatives gathered around the table agree
        that Patton's success isn't unusual. </p>
        <p>They also nod when they hear of the states'
        investigations. No one seems to believe the allegations
        and questions will amount to anything. </p>
        <p>''They're asked of any multilevel marketing company,''
        Patterson said. </p>
        <p>The inquiries have come from North Carolina, Michigan,
        Ohio and Georgia. Their questions focus on a number of
        potential problems: </p>
        <p>* Who is buying CAT merchandise -- consumers or
        representatives? </p>
        <p>* How much are representatives paying to start up
        their marketing centers? </p>
        <p>* Is the CAT pass a product worth buying? Is it even a
        product? </p>
        <p>Robert Ward, a Michigan assistant attorney general in
        the consumer protection division, posed some of these
        questions in an investigation this spring. The answers
        weren't good. </p>
        <p>''We've cited them for violating our illegal pyramid
        statute,'' Ward said. ''We don't consider it (the CAT
        pass) a product. It's a piece of paper that's only good
        for travel through one specific travel agency in one
        specific city. If they disappear, who's left carrying the
        bag? You are.'' </p>
        <p>CAT marketing director Pam Allen said it's ridiculous
        to claim the CAT pass isn't a product. </p>
        <p>''If you go to a travel agent and give them your
        credit card to pay for a trip, what do you get for
        that?'' she asked. ''You haven't received anything until
        you take your trip. There is a certain amount of trust
        that's always involved.'' </p>
        <p>Ward said his investigation also showed CAT made very
        few sales to consumers. That's often a red flag that
        flies over a pyramid scheme. </p>
        <p>''Most legitimate and viable MLMs have a substantial
        customer base outside the other marketers in their
        downline,'' he said. ''I'm not certain anybody is buying
        a CAT certificate unless they're also getting involved in
        selling certificates.'' </p>
        <p>Straub said this point could be true, but they never
        intended to sell only to reps. </p>
        <p>Ward said his office is working to bring CAT into
        compliance. At present, he said, anyone who sells CAT
        passes in Michigan ''is doing it at their own risk.'' </p>
        <p>The Ohio investigation, concluded in June, also found
        that CAT had operated an illegal pyramid scheme. </p>
        <p>''They sold travel coupons, and their agents would be
        able to earn more travel coupons by getting others to
        purchase them and join,'' said Todd Boyer, a spokesman
        for the Ohio attorney general's office. ''That met our
        definition for a pyramid scheme.'' </p>
        <p>Boyer said Ohio officials have worked with CAT to
        bring the company into compliance. </p>
        <p>An investigation by the Georgia Governor's Office of
        Consumer Affairs promises to wind up soon, according to
        public information officer Carolyn Mills. </p>
        <p>Though Straub said he wouldn't apologize for the way
        the program has developed, he has proposed a number of
        changes that he said should help CAT increase consumer
        sales, offer cheaper trips through a new wholesale travel
        division and make it cheaper and easier to become a
        distributor. </p>
        <p>''We will eliminate any and all arguments in the
        states (that have challenged CAT),'' he said. </p>
        <p>Until then, many CAT representatives in Knoxville say
        they've got nothing but optimism about the future. This
        CAT, they maintain, has many more lives ahead. ''This is
        the greatest thing to come to East Tennessee. It could
        change people's whole perspective,'' said independent
        representative Steve Bradley. ''Yes, 1997 will be the
        year of the CAT.'' </p>

        <p>A day of beauty at Salon Visage is like having the
        whole dessert tray at the Orangery. It's an indulgence so
        wickedly wonderful it makes you feel guilty. </p>
        <p>When folks at Salon Visage sell somebody a Day of
        Beauty, they are talking about a whole day and possibly
        part of the evening. Somebody crassly pointed out that
        you can have surgery these days faster than you can get
        the full treatment at Salon Visage. And it's true. But a
        day at Salon Visage is, oh, so much fun. </p>
        <IMG SRC="../../images/logos/resolvelogo.gif" ALIGN=right ALT="I Resolve" WIDTH=177 HEIGHT=203><p>Salon Visage feels more like Club Med than your
        average beauty parlor. At its new Downtown West location,
        hosts and hostesses escort clients to the appropriate
        section of the salon. </p>
        <p>Customers sit before full-length framed mirrors with
        halogen spotlights beaming down from above and none of
        that hairdresser clutter between themselves and their
        reflection. (Curling irons and such are stashed in
        cubicles hidden behind the mirrors.) Those getting hair
        color gather at long, highly polished, boardroom-like
        tables and listen to high-tone jazz piped through the
        sound system. Even the hair on the acid-washed concrete
        floor is sucked away by air suction at either end of the
        cutting area. </p>
        <p>The new salon is the dream come true of owners Frank
        and Belinda Gambuzza. For three years the Gambuzzas
        traveled and visited top salons in the United States,
        Canada and Italy, bringing back with them ideas they
        implemented in the new salon. </p>

        </table>
        <p>So when the Gambuzzas invited The News-Sentinel
        to come experience a Day of Beauty at its new location,
        there was little arm twisting necessary. In fact, copy
        editor Mary Dee Booher leaped at the opportunity.
        Literally. Leaped and waved and shouted, ''Let me! I'll
        do it!'' </p>
        <p>So we did. And what she discovered is that she had
        waited far too long to have a pedicure. </p>
        <p>But, we're getting ahead of ourselves. First, let's
        talk about Mary Dee's haircut. Frank Gambuzza did the
        honors himself. (Gambuzza is so popular among his clients
        that he only opens his appointment book four days a year
        to schedule cuts. His book fills immediately, despite the
        $55 to $60 he charges clients.) </p>
        <p>Gambuzza consults with each client before ever picking
        up his scissors, as do all the cutters at Salon Visage.
        First question: What don't you want? Then, an evaluation:
        Here is what your hair is capable of. </p>
        <p>What Mary Dee didn't want was short hair. What
        Gambuzza recommended for her very fine, naturally curly
        hair was removing the older, frazzled hair from the
        bottom and cutting her naturally curly hair in graduated
        layers to give height to the front and volume to the back
        of her head. To emphasize her eyes and cheekbones, he
        shaped her hair high over one eye, while dropping it over
        the other. </p>
        <p>''Our number one goal is to be sure that tomorrow
        you'll be glad you came here today,'' Gambuzza says.
        ''Our number two goal is to make sure you can manage your
        hair yourself, because if you can't, nobody will ask who
        did your hair.'' </p>
        <p>Following her haircut, Mary Dee was escorted to the
        glass-enclosed pedicure room, where she soaked her
        piggies in a warm, antiseptic whirlpool bath while her
        chair vibrated the tensions from her back. Ed Karn is a
        former corporate management type who traded tension for
        toenails and fingernails (''The worst thing that happens
        here is we choose the wrong nail color, and we can change
        that,'' Karn says). He arrives to treat Mary Dee to what
        she later declares to be the best part of the day -- her
        pedicure. </p>
        <p>Karn trimmed and filed Mary Dee's toenails. Rubbed
        cuticle softener on and pushed cuticles back. Razored off
        her calluses. Massaged her feet. Pampered and petted and
        then capped it all off with bright red nail polish. </p>
        <p>''I had never had a pedicure, because I just didn't
        think I'd like somebody messing with my feet,'' Mary Dee
        says of the experience. ''I was wrong. I'll be back.'' </p>

        <p>Julie Reggio gave Mary Dee a natural French manicure
        and a hand massage before sending her back to the main
        part of the salon and some time with Belinda Gambuzza,
        the color specialist in the marriage-business
        partnership. </p>
        <p>Belinda, with help from Kip Allen, applied a foil
        weave to Mary Dee's hair, lightening her naturally brown
        hair with sandy blond highlights to complement her hazel
        eyes and ruddy complexion. </p>
        <p>(In the end, her hair was a little too blond for Mary
        Dee's taste. The Gambuzzas invited her back to adjust the
        color, and Belinda darkened it with red highlights. Mary
        Dee, who sees herself more as a redhead than a blonde,
        returned more satisfied with the final result.) </p>
        <p>Next on the agenda was a facial by esthetician Kristy
        Stuart. The facial is performed in a dimly-lit,
        soundproof room to maximize its soothing effects. </p>
        <p>The 90-minute procedure begins with a consultation in
        which Stuart discusses the client's medical conditions
        and skin care routine. Then she examines the face under
        ultraviolet lights, which highlight dry skin, clogged
        pores and other skin problems. She found dry skin to be
        Mary Dee's primary skin condition. </p>
        <p>Next she massaged Mary Dee's face with a cleansing
        cream, rolling her knuckles gently across cheeks and
        jaws, rubbing, stroking, almost dancing across her face
        to the accompaniment of soothing relaxation music and
        candles burning in the room. </p>
        <p>Stuart massaged lotion into Mary Dee's shoulders and
        neck. She applied a soothing herbal clay-based mask to
        her face and then used a high frequency current to push
        moisture into her pores. </p>
        <p>A complete cosmetic makeover followed the facial.
        Stuart gave Mary Dee a soft, neutral look with ivory and
        taupe eyeshadows, 'paprika' blush and 'maple' lip color.
        Some tips from the expert: apply foundation to eyelids to
        make eye colors adhere better; use powder eyeshadows as
        eyeliner by applying them with a wet brush. </p>
        <p>Following her makeover, Mary Dee returned to the
        haircut department for her final styling. Chris Palamidis
        blow-dried, curled, sprayed and fussed until she had Mary
        Dee's hair just so. She spun Mary Dee around for a first
        look in the full-length mirror at the new, beautified
        her. Her reaction: ''Oh, law!'' and a giggle. </p>
        <p>By now you're wondering exactly what all this
        pampering costs. A Day of Beauty, including cut and
        style, hair color, manicure, pedicure, facial, makeover
        and lunch, costs $150. Individual services vary depending
        on the experience level of the stylist. Full-head
        highlights, for instance, range from $65 to $75. A
        deep-cleansing facial costs $45. A manicure costs $12 to
        $17; a pedicure costs $25 to $30. </p>
        <p>As a result of her Day of Beauty, Mary Dee is more
        conscious of skin care, making sure she removes her
        makeup and moisturizes her face before bed. She is using
        the facial creme and hydrating gel by MD Formulations
        that Stuart used at Salon Visage and feels it's more
        effective than the product she had been using. </p>
        <p>She also is very pleased with the haircut Gambuzza
        gave her. Though she seldom spends the time at home to
        style it like they did at the salon, Mary Dee is well
        satisfied with her hair length and the body the cut gave
        it. </p>
        <p>And now the real question: In her opinion, is a Day of
        Beauty really worth $150? </p>
        <p>Not a moment's hesitation precedes her response: ''Oh,
        yes. Definitely.'' </p>

</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Eleni Chamis, News-Sentinel business writer</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority is embarking on a $61 million construction project -- the largest it has ever undertaken -- as it plans the renovation of the McGhee Tyson Airport terminal and the building of new concourses.
<P>   The venture also could be one of the largest public projects in the area in the last 50 years, second only to the construction of Pellissippi Parkway, according to Darrell Akins, an authority board member. It would position the airport, which will celebrate its 60th year in 1997, for the next 20 to 25 years.
<P>   The authority has hired HNTB Tennessee, an architectural, engineering and planning firm to work locally with McCarty Holsaple McCarty in designing the project.
<P>   &#39;&#39;When we talked about Pellissippi Parkway, we talked about it as a symbol, not just a slab of asphalt,&#39;&#39; said Akins. &#39;&#39;It was a symbol of unifying our region, of our technology corridor. It became a real rallying point -- that we needed to work together to unify our growth. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;In my view, this airport can be a symbol for 2000 to 2010, just like Pellissippi Parkway was in the 1980s.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Needed, say authority members, is a more efficient, technologically updated airport that better addresses passenger comfort and convenience.
<P>   The project would be financed by passenger facility charges (PFCs), federal and state grants and airport revenue bonds, according to Terry Igoe, executive director of the airport authority.<B> </B>It is unknown whether PFCs will be increased, officials said. There are no plans to increase parking fees.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It became apparent to me when we visited airports in other communities, like Providence, R.I., and Manchester, N.H., and saw the types of facilities they have that ours are totally out of date,&#39;&#39; said Akins.
<P>   The current McGhee Tyson terminal cost $12 million and was opened in April 1974, with service from five airlines. About 774,000 passengers used the airport that year. The airport passed the 1 million passenger per year mark in 1986.
<P>   This year, McGhee Tyson is expected to set an all-time record with 1.4 million passengers. A growth forecast estimates those numbers will continue at a 3.5 percent annual rate. The airport now is served by 13 airlines, six of them commuters.
<P>   An updated airport facility also would be effective in aiding the region&#39;s economic development and as a means of possibly enticing more airlines to serve Knoxville or encouraging existing ones to expand their services, airport authority representatives say.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The airport is the front door of our community,&#39;&#39; said Richard Krieg, chairman of the airport authority. &#39;&#39;The first impression someone new has is what they see when they step off the plane. Whatever we build should demonstrate a modern, up-to-date, optimistic feeling toward our area.&#39;&#39;
<P>   While Chattanooga and the Tri-Cities have had recent losses in air service, McGhee Tyson&#39;s has grown. This year alone, three airlines inaugurated service from Knoxville. Continental Express is offering three daily flights to Cleveland, Ohio; Lone Star flies daily to Dallas/Fort Worth and also serves as an American Airlines feeder; and Corporate Express provides five daily flights to Nashville.
<P>   Igoe foresees continuing growth for the East Tennessee region. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;Consequently, there will be a demand for continued growth in air service,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;The way the industry is going with more low-fare carriers, some of them will recognize this market and make it a part of their business plan. Some of the older major carriers that are not in this marketplace could come in. American could come back; Continental could come in with jets.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The scope of the airport project would be far-reaching with much of the terminal work spent reconfiguring space by relocating concessions and retail shops into a more centralized location; expanding a common lobby area; relocating the airport&#39;s one elevator; and moving its two escalators. The parking garage would be able to accommodate 4,052 vehicles when its expansion is completed in April 1997.
<P>   McGhee Tyson&#39;s deficiencies, from all accounts, are many.
<P>   Ticket counters and holding areas at the gates are not nearly large enough. Corridors need to be widened. Commuter airlines have concerns with serving the needs of the elderly and handicapped, who now have to climb stairs to board an aircraft. The HVAC, electrical, and mechanical systems need replacement.&#39;&#39;Due to equipment changes and technology changes, the realistic life of an airport facility is about 20 years. We are in that time frame,&#39;&#39; said Krieg. &#39;&#39;If we want to get full value out of what we&#39;re doing, now seems the time.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The airport is considering two schemes for the airport -- one a &#39;&#39;Y&#39;&#39; shape and the other a &#39;&#39;U&#39;&#39; shape that&#39;s referred to as &#39;&#39;U1.&#39;&#39; The airport&#39;s current shape is a &#39;&#39;U.&#39;&#39; U1 would basically be a renewal of what already exists. 
<P>   Both would cost between $38 million and $42 million to construct, but the differences are numerous.
<P>   U1 is a bit larger and would require a longer construction period but less airfield work. The Y, on the other hand, provides enhanced security, greater passenger convenience and flexibility, more retail opportunities, and elevators close to commuter gates. The Y also minimizes the disruption to the traveling public.
<P>   The airport&#39;s current revenues from food, beverage and retail outlets total $260,000 a year. With a relocated restaurant and gift shop, HNTB projects increases of as much as $1.3 million over five-years.
<P>   The 12- to 15-month design development phase will begin once a plan has been selected. The Y would take 20 to 24 months to construct and U1 about a year longer. The number of gates would not increase with either plan, remaining at 12.
<P>   Work will be completed in phases, and total construction time would be three years once the architect proceeds with a preferred scheme.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s important to understand the nuts and bolts and square footage, but even bigger is the symbolism of it all,&#39;&#39; said Akins. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s when communities really move and grow.&#39;&#39;
<P>   To accomplish that, airport consultants have been doing a lot of talking about image -- using natural materials, utilizing indigenous plants and trees, lots of open spaces and large windows, artwork and cultural displays.
<P>   &#39;&#39;When you go to the Phoenix airport, by golly, you know you&#39;re in the Southwest, and you know you&#39;re close to the Grand Canyon,&#39;&#39; said Akins. &#39;&#39;You don&#39;t think you&#39;re in New York or anywhere else.&#39;&#39;
<P>
<P>   In the plan, consultants are also including an economic development center, business centers equipped with faxes and modems, possibly fiber optic capabilities, and expanded flight information systems.
<P>   HNTB has designed more than 45 airport terminals and provided design services for 100 others. Regionally, they have done work in Charleston, S.C.; Charlotte, N.C.; Wilmington, N.C.; Atlanta, Miami and Baton Rouge, La.

<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>RVING, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys finally played like defending Super Bowl champions.
<P>    Dallas discovered its missing offense, George Teague was a one-man gang on defense, and the Cowboys knocked the Minnesota Vikings out of the playoffs 40-15 in an NFC wild-card game Saturday.
<P>    The Cowboys, who struggled to a 10-6 regular-season record before winning the NFC East for the fifth consecutive time, will play the Carolina Panthers at Charlotte at 3 p.m. next Sunday in the NFC divisional round.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This team is still what it is and hasn&#39;t fallen out of sight,&#39;&#39; said coach Barry Switzer. &#39;&#39;We made a statement today. We&#39;re still the team to beat for the Super Bowl.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The Cowboys took out all their frustrations on the Vikings after a chaotic regular season of suspensions, injuries and underachieving performances.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We turned it up a level,&#39;&#39; Switzer said. &#39;&#39;We played a total offensive game, and the defense was just great. George Teague had an amazing game. &#39;&#39;
<P>    The Vikings self-destructed in the biggest scoring half in Dallas playoff history as the Cowboys rolled to a 30-0 lead at halftime. The Cowboys forced five turnovers and cashed them in for 23 points.
<P>    On offense, Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin and Emmitt Smith executed like they did in winning three Super Bowls in the last four years. Teague made three big defensive plays to stun the Vikings, who qualified for the playoffs with a 9-7 regular season record.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This is a message for whoever has been talking trash about the Cowboys,&#39;&#39; said Smith.
<P>    Smith, dogged by injuries and even benched at one time during the season, scored twice and set or tied five NFL playoff records for rushing and scoring. He rushed for 116 yards on 17 carries.
<P>    Aikman ran for a touchdown, passed for one and completed 19-of-29 passes for 178 yards. He is 11-1 in playoff starts and is second only to Green Bay&#39;s Bart Starr in playoff ratings.
<P>    Irvin, who missed five games under NFL suspension, had his best game of the year by catching eight passes for 103 yards.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The defense has been winning games and it&#39;s time the offense got started and we did,&#39;&#39; Irvin said.
<P>    Dallas, ranked 24th offensively in the NFL, struck on its first possession as Aikman completed four passes for 65 yards to Irvin in an 88-yard touchdown drive. The payoff came when Aikman rolled right and scored from the 2.
<P>    Then came a bizarre play that took the heart out of the Vikings. Amp Lee took a short pass over the middle and appeared on the way for a 43-yard touchdown. However, Teague caught Lee at the 1 and poked the ball out of his hands and out of the end zone for a touchback.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t think Lee knew I was there,&#39;&#39; Teague said.
<P>    Lee knew Teague was there and tried to tuck the ball away.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I take full responsibility,&#39;&#39; Lee said. &#39;&#39;That early in the game if we get seven points we make a statement. If we score there it&#39;s 7-7. They came out with a lot of emotion but we could take it away.
<P>    &#39;&#39;From that play everything snowballed against us.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Chris Boniol then kicked the first of his four field goals, a 28-yarder.
<P>    Minnesota coach Dennis Green said &#39;&#39;whatever they needed to get done offensively or defensively they got done. &#39;&#39;
<P>    Green said the game turned on Lee&#39;s mistake.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Amp made one of the best plays of the day but got careless,&#39;&#39; Green said.
<P>    Minnesota gave Dallas the ball again when Teague hit Leroy Hoard, who fumbled to Deion Sanders. On the next play, Smith followed textbook blocking 37 yards for a touchdown.
<P>    Teague, a free agent refugee from Green Bay, struck again as Brad Johnson, making his first playoff start, threw across the middle. Teague picked off the pass and went 29 yards for a touchdown to make it 24-0.
<P>    Sanders&#39; interception off Johnson, his former Florida State teammate, set Dallas up for a 31-yard Boniol field goal.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Teague was starting to make me jealous so I had to have one,&#39;&#39; Sanders said.
<P>    Teague set up in ambush for Johnson&#39;s pass.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I kept hoping he would try to throw it back over the middle because I was just waiting,&#39;&#39; Teague said.
<P>    &#39;&#39;There were some balls Brad shouldn&#39;t have thrown and that was one of them,&#39;&#39; Green said.

        <p><font size="2"><i>By Wesley Loy, News-Sentinel staff
        writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">A</font>fter years of fierce opposition, a
        private landfill for construction and demolition debris
        has opened quietly in East Knox County. </p>
        <p>Knox County commissioners earlier this year appeared
        ready to go to jail to stop the project, voting to deny a
        permit in defiance of a judge's order. </p>
        <p>Residents had argued Poplarview Landfill -- situated
        on 38 acres along the Holston River off Rutledge Pike --
        could contaminate a nearby drinking water plant. </p>
        <p>But Knox County Circuit Judge Harold Wimberly, in a
        March 15 judgment, said opponents could offer ''no more
        than . . . unsupported opinions'' that the water could be
        contaminated. He said the landfill complied with all
        state and local laws and that a 1994 permit denial by the
        Knox County Board of Zoning Appeals was ''illegal and
        arbitrary.'' </p>
        <p>With no legal leg to stand on, the county's Public
        Works Department ultimately was compelled to issue a
        permit, said Mike Moyers, deputy law director for Knox
        County. </p>
        <p>And it did, on June 26. </p>
        <p>Within the last week or so, trucks began rumbling down
        a muddy, gravel road leading to gaping, red-clay pits. On
        Friday, bulldozers were packing down heaps of
        construction debris -- drywall, empty five-gallon
        buckets, splintered lumber and the like. </p>
        <p>The landfill, on land owned by the Walker trucking and
        construction firm, backs a heavily industrialized area
        that includes a railroad yard, metal salvage yard,
        trucking firms and a plant for burning contaminated dirt.
        </p>
        <p>Also nearby is the mammoth Twin Oaks Landfill, which
        was sealed shut earlier this decade. </p>
        <p>For Jan Fay, president of Construction and Demolition
        Landfill Services Inc., opening Poplarview was a long and
        tedious struggle. After both the Metropolitan Planning
        Commission and the Knox County Board of Zoning Appeals
        refused to OK the project, Fay's company sued the county
        in December 1994. </p>
        <p>A few months earlier, the Tennessee Department of
        Environment and Conservation had deemed the site suitable
        for a landfill and issued a permit. </p>
        <p>No one from Fay's office returned a phone call seeking
        comment Friday. </p>
        <p>Poplarview's opening infuriated John McDaniel, who led
        East Knox residents in a four-year fight against the
        landfill. He was flabbergasted that a landfill could be
        allowed next door to a water plant. </p>
        <p>McDaniel said he and his neighbors are tired of
        ''getting dumped on,'' having endured four landfills over
        the years in their area. A retired zinc mine supervisor,
        McDaniel suspected the area harbors crevices and
        sinkholes that could bring contamination to the Northeast
        Knox Utility District Water Plant, which draws water from
        the Holston River just a few hundred feet upstream from
        the landfill. </p>
        <p>''I think, truly, we've been shafted,'' McDaniel said.
        </p>
        <p>Indeed, a water plant official in 1993 wrote the
        state's Division of Solid Waste that it was possible
        during heavy rains that runoff from the landfill could
        end up in Legg Creek and, from there, in the Holston
        River upstream of the point where water is drawn. The
        plant official also expressed concern about landfill dust
        blowing over the plant, said to serve more than 12,000
        people. </p>
        <p>But in another letter the next year, the plant
        official said his concerns over the landfill had been
        satisfied. </p>
        <p>A sign at the Poplarview entrance states the landfill
        will accept construction and demolition materials, brush
        and leaves, brick and block, tree stumps and shredded
        tires. </p>
        <p>John Evans, Knox County solid waste administrator,
        said Fay opened another construction and demolition
        landfill about a year ago off Oak Ridge Highway in
        Solway. That landfill is called Ridgeview. </p>
        <p>The only other such landfill is off Riverside Drive in
        East Knoxville, he said. </p>
        <p>These specialized landfills represent a fundamental
        shift in the way solid waste is handled, Evans said. </p>
        <p>It used to be that governments ran landfills that
        catered to all comers. Now the trend is toward big,
        regional landfills operated by private companies on
        private land. </p>
        <p>A landmark law, the Tennessee Solid Waste Management
        Act of 1991, encouraged counties to reduce by 25 percent
        the amount of waste going to so-called sanitary landfills
        -- common garbage dumps that are the most dangerous and
        expensive to operate because of their seepage and gas
        production. </p>
        <p>To accomplish the reduction, the act encouraged
        recycling, composting and landfills that take dry,
        relatively ''inert'' materials, like construction debris
        and brush, Evans said. Such landfills are much in demand
        by builders. </p>
        <p>In 1995, Knox County produced 1.23 tons of garbage for
        every man, woman and child, Evans said. Most of Knox
        County's garbage is exported to landfills in Anderson and
        Union counties. </p>

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>&#39;Sons of Noah&#39; are Christians converted to Torah</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Ronda Robinson, Special to The News-Sentinel</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>THENS, Tenn. -- It&#39;s not something you expect in the Bible Belt, or from a former Baptist preacher. But on a warm Sunday morning in Athens, when Christians are flocking to churches of every stripe, David Davis is teaching Torah to his congregation.
<P>    They&#39;ve been studying Torah, the Five Books of Moses that compose part of the Hebrew Bible, for years.
<P>    Davis, a former Baptist minister and now leader of Emmanuel B&#39;nai Noah Congregation, peppers his study session on free will with worldly rabbinic commentary and down-home Southern talk.
<P>   &#39;&#39;If a person chooses evil, what will he get? This is straight out of what our mamas used to tell us: You reap what you sow,&#39;&#39; he says in his native Georgia drawl.
<P>    Some 35 adults and children sip coffee and cola and listen attentively from their neat rows of folding tables and chairs. The sparsely decorated room with a gumball machine up front serves as a temporary home for the group.
<P>    Their calm demeanor belies an upheaval which has captured headlines from Wall Street to Jerusalem and drawn fire from preachers, teachers, neighbors and strangers across America.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The thing that disturbed me most was that the children from our assembly were being attacked verbally in school by other children. These children were repeating what they had heard at home and in church,&#39;&#39; Davis recalls in his new book, &#39;&#39;Finding the God of Noah.&#39;&#39;
<P>    These congregants have survived a transition from fundamentalist Baptist church to Noahite congregation -- followers of the Seven Laws of Noah, the commandments incumbent on non-Jews according to rabbinic tradition. The Sons of Noah observe six negative commandments and one positive: against idolatry, blasphemy, sexual immorality, stealing, murder, and eating the limb of a living animal, and for establishing courts of justice. 
<P>    While they regard themselves as having converted to Torah, they don&#39;t feel the need to convert to Judaism; after all, keeping the Seven Laws of Noah as non-Jews qualifies them as righteous gentiles under Jewish law.
<P>    However, Davis, who chooses to keep kosher, invites 20 to 30 guests for dinner on Shabbat -- the Sabbath -- and observes Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Simhat Torah, Hanukkah, Passover and Shavuot.
<P>    He and his flock have abandoned crosses, Christ and Christmas.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The people in this congregation gave up the deity of Jesus easier than they did the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus,&#39;&#39; Davis wryly observes in an interview.
<P>    After much soul-searching, he concluded that Jesus is called the Son of God, but nowhere in the New Testament is he called God the Son.
<P>    The imposing man with salt-and-pepper beard and mustache knew as a child that he wanted to become a preacher. Reared in a small town southeast of Atlanta, he received his B.A. degree -- &#39;&#39;born again,&#39;&#39; he quips -- in 1972 from Tennessee Temple Schools. In 1973, the year after what was then Emmanuel Baptist Church of Athens invited Davis to serve as pastor, he began straying from the straight and narrow.
<P>    He and a friend decided they knew little about the historical Jesus, and Davis embarked on years of research. But his studies unearthed more questions than answers.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I realized that the only way I was going to find out about the historical Jesus was to study Judaism,&#39;&#39; he says in his book recently released by KTAV, a 70-year-old New Jersey publishing house that specializes in works of Jewish interest.
<P>    In 1987 he publicly announced that he did not believe in the divinity of Jesus.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Why not convert?&#39;&#39; strangers ask him with predictable regularity. Another common question goes, &#39;&#39;Are you Jewish or Christian?&#39;&#39; He responds, &#39;&#39;Neither, I am a Ben Noah, a son of Noah, following the commandments established by God with Noah and his descendants forever, as it says in the Bible: &#39;And behold, I establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you.&#39; &#39;&#39;
<P>    The congregation founded as a Baptist church in the early 1960s has not always been graciously accepted by the local community since its incarnation as Emmanuel B&#39;nai Noah, which is part of an international community of Noahites. One autumn day in 1989, for example, Davis and crew removed the building&#39;s 26-foot steeple and carted it off to the dump. In their studies, they had discovered that steeples had roots in paganism. 
<P>    The stripping of Emmanuel enraged the East Tennessee town of 12,000 where most residents are Baptists. Locals said the congregants would go straight to hell. They called them Christ-haters. They proclaimed Davis crazy.  
<P>    Half the congregants abandoned the Noahite ship. Some 80 remain, from factory workers to attorneys. They come from Athens and surrounding small towns. One makes the drive from Atlanta to participate in congregational study sessions in person with Davis on Sundays and via long-distance speaker phone with Rabbi Israel Chait, an Orthodox rabbi in Far Rockaway, N.Y., on Wednesdays.
<P>    A friend and teacher of the congregation for several years, the rabbi sings praises in his foreward to Davis&#39;s book: &#39;&#39;The B&#39;nai Noah movement contains people of outstanding courage who have abandoned the ways of their ancestors, often at great personal sacrifice, in order to embrace the Torah and the way of life of the One God of Israel.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Emmanuel charges no dues. Congregants give of their own accord. In his cozy, book-lined office, Davis says, &#39;&#39;People just give. It&#39;s a small, dedicated group of supporters.&#39;&#39; Fire consumed their building earlier this year, and he is convinced arson wasn&#39;t the cause. Money for a new study center is coming from congregants.
<P>    Meanwhile, the Noahides meet in a triple-wide &#39;&#39;modular unit&#39;&#39; -- verbiage carefully chosen, because, as the flamboyant leader explains, &#39;&#39;You can&#39;t set trailers up in Athens except in a trailer park.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Because of the fire, the Tennessee Noahides hosted their 11th annual conference at a nearby Elks Lodge in November. Some 300 Noahides and friends came from places as far-flung as Seattle, Los Angeles, Toronto and Melbourne, Australia, to hear religion professors, Davis, Chait and his wife, Freyda, speak on such topics as &#39;&#39;False Prophets,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;The Evil Tongue&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Hidden Mountain: Ancient Israelite Site in New Mexico?&#39;&#39;
<P>    According to Davis, Emmanuel is the largest Noahite group in the country and serves as the clearinghouse for the movement, which he estimates at 600 followers in the United States alone. One such believer is Tom Slater, a former Broward County, Fla., deputy sheriff and forensic investigator.
<P>    A burly ex-Marine, Slater lives in the mountains near Athens and once programmed computers for the Church of God.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I have never felt so good about anything in my life,&#39;&#39; he says of the spiritual journey that led to the Laws of Noah. Along the way he had to give up 51 years of indoctrination.
<P>    Says Slater: &#39;&#39;I had a hard time slaying a lot of theological cows, to the point where the last thing I let go of was Jesus. I was afraid.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The Noahides&#39; strength, courage and earnestness impresses Rabbi Zalman Posner of Nashville, whom the late Lubavitcher Rebbe sent South nearly 50 years ago to head an Orthodox congregation.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s an American kind of phenomenon: independence of spirit. It&#39;s nice to see people who don&#39;t need public approval,&#39;&#39; Posner says. Noahides want to live a moral and ethical life, and place strong emphasis on family and education, the rabbi observes. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think it is an excellent thing, it&#39;s appropriate: people who are seeking religious guidance and inspiration and they find it in Torah sources.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Davis acknowledges that the Athens Noahides perhaps would find more understanding in a larger place, but he believes that to uproot the congregation would be escapism.
<P>   &#39;&#39;You stay where God puts you,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;What better place to have a Torah Belt than in the Bible Belt?&#39;&#39;

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Aired dirty laundry likely in ADM lawsuit</B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Observers say firm faces public relations nightmare</FONT><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I></I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">U</FONT>RBANA, Ill. -- When Archer Daniels Midland Co. learned top executive Mark Whitacre had made secret tapes for an FBI price-fixing probe, the company fought back: It fired Whitacre, accused him of embezzlement and eventually sued him.
<P>    But that lawsuit could end up doing more harm than good to the company that calls itself &#39;&#39;Supermarket to the world,&#39;&#39; some legal experts say.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Generally, employers retaliate against whistle blowers by firing them or trying to blacklist them, rather than with lawsuits,&#39;&#39; says Tom Devine of the Government Accountability Project, a Washington-based group that offers legal help to whistle blowers.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The reason is simple: The dirty laundry from the employer gets exposed in the lawsuit.&#39;&#39;
<P>    In this case, ADM&#39;s pile of dirty laundry is quite large. Thanks to Whitacre&#39;s secret tapes of his fellow ADM executives, the company pleaded guilty in October and agreed to pay $100 million, the largest criminal antitrust fine in history, for its role in two international conspiracies to fix prices and divide up markets for lysine and citric acid around the world.
<P>    Whitacre can use the lawsuit to air other accusations against ADM, including his assertions that he was fired for his FBI work and that top company officials illegally salted away millions of dollars in overseas bank accounts.
<P>    ADM&#39;s lawsuit accuses Whitacre of stealing about $9 million from the company in a bogus invoicing scheme. The suit also says Whitacre violated a confidentiality agreement by giving internal ADM information to the government.
<P>    Whitacre says the faked invoices and payments into his overseas bank accounts were approved by top ADM managers as part of an under-the-table bonus plan for company executives. He has filed a counter-lawsuit against ADM, saying company officials defamed him in media interviews and demanding the return of stock options now worth about $1.5 million.
<P>    Even if ADM wins, it could suffer even more bad publicity by seemingly retaliating against the man who brought the company down in a criminal case.
<P>    &#39;&#39;If I represented them (ADM), I&#39;d settle the case early,&#39;&#39; said University of Illinois law professor Elaine Shoben. &#39;&#39;As a matter of public policy, you shouldn&#39;t allow suits against people who reveal illegality.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The fact that ADM admitted fixing prices could hurt the company&#39;s case in a jury&#39;s eyes, said Rita Risser, a Santa Cruz, Calif., lawyer specializing in employment issues.
<P>    &#39;&#39;If you say, &#39;Well, yeah, we did price-fixing, but this guy did something to us, too,&#39; I don&#39;t think that plays well with a jury,&#39;&#39; Risser said.
<P>    But the lawsuit provides possible pitfalls for Whitacre as well. Whitacre, who pleaded innocent last week to a federal price-fixing indictment, could have problems swaying a jury by arguing the ADM payments were authorized.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Even if what he says is true and this money is off-the-books compensation approved by management, that still doesn&#39;t make it right,&#39;&#39; Risser said. &#39;&#39;It still sounds pretty sleazy, so he&#39;s going to be walking a fine line, justifying taking the money on the one hand and on the other hand reporting ADM for violations.&#39;&#39;
<P>    ADM&#39;s timing is often well-planned -- the company announced its guilty plea on a holiday, when government and financial offices were closed, for example -- but the lawsuit&#39;s timing led to a legal setback for the company.
<P>    ADM officials had been accusing Whitacre of fraud for almost a year before they filed the lawsuit in state court in ADM&#39;s hometown of Decatur, Ill., on Sept. 19. The day before, ADM had obtained a copy of a letter Whitacre faxed to reporters announcing his planned move to North Carolina, court records show.
<P>    ADM tried to keep the lawsuit in the Decatur court, arguing that Whitacre was still an Illinois resident the day the lawsuit was filed. But a federal magistrate disagreed, ruling that the suit should stay in federal court because Whitacre was in the process of moving when ADM sued him.
<P>    Such &#39;&#39;jurisdiction shopping&#39;&#39; -- filing a lawsuit in the court deemed most friendly to one side or the other -- is quite common, Risser said.
<P>    The case also could prompt more legal troubles for ADM in the future. If the company proves Whitacre stole money, shareholders could sue, claiming ADM&#39;s internal policing was too lax to catch a multimillion-dollar fraud.
<P>    If Whitacre proves the payments were approved, ADM could face both criminal and civil lawsuits for fraud or tax evasion.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This seems like a no-win for ADM,&#39;&#39; Risser said.

</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By The Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>THENS, Ga. -- The University of Georgia will wait until a January meeting with the NCAA enforcement staff before deciding whether to sanction itself for violating four rules.
<P>    Georgia, which admitted the violations Friday, denied six other allegations in releasing its response to the NCAA Infractions Committee.
<P>    Georgia denied the two most serious allegations:
<P>    * That former assistant coach Frank Orgel offered current Auburn football player Martavius Houston $7,500 to sign with Georgia, plus $500 a month and a car.
<P>    * That Orgel told another recruit now at Auburn, Errick Lowe, he would receive an unspecified monthly allowance and a truck in a couple of years.
<P>    &#39;&#39;In my investigation, I found no substantial information to implicate Frank Orgel,&#39;&#39; said Ed Tolley, attorney for the school.
<P>    School officials will meet with the NCAA in January and will decide after that whether to impose sanctions, university president Charles Knapp said. The NCAA also could impose sanctions.
<P>    Athletic director Vince Dooley said Georgia is committed to abiding by NCAA rules.
<P>    The most serious violation Georgia admitted to involved Dan Calloway, a youth sports organizer in south Florida.  It agreed that he acted improperly as a representative of Georgia&#39;s athletic program.
<P>   A similar Calloway connection at Michigan State led to NCAA sanctions against that university.

        <font size="5"><br>
        Condition upgraded</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Add Seymour Jr., Associated Press</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">N</font>ASHVILLE -- James Earl Ray, the
        confessed killer of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.,
        regained consciousness after several days in a coma and
        was laughing and talking with his brother Thursday
        afternoon. </p>
        <p>''He looked 100 percent better,'' Jerry Ray said after
        leaving the hospital. ''He's talking and everything.'' </p>
        <p>James Earl Ray, who suffers from liver and kidney
        damage, was upgraded from critical to serious condition,
        said Cheryl Goforth, chief operating officer for Columbia
        Nashville Memorial Hospital. </p>
        <p>''It is still serious, but he seems to be more
        stable,'' she said. </p>
        <p>She wouldn't comment further. </p>
        <p>Jerry Ray said the change isn't really a turnaround
        because doctors have told him that his brother would be
        drifting in and out of consciousness. </p>
        <p>He couldn't finish entire sentences, but Jerry Ray
        said his brother smiled at jokes. </p>
        <p>''He's in a good mood, laughing with a big grin, and I
        figure if he's in a good mood, he should stay in a good
        mood,'' Jerry Ray said. </p>
        <p>He didn't talk with his brother about anything serious
        but said doctors have told him James Earl Ray has only a
        10 percent chance of survival, even if doctors perform
        surgery. </p>
        <p>Jerry Ray didn't know what kind of surgery they were
        considering, and doctors did not respond Thursday to a
        request for an interview. </p>
        <p>Even if Ray goes under the knife, ''the most he'd live
        is up to a year,'' Jerry Ray said. </p>
        <p>Andrew Hall, an attorney representing James Earl Ray,
        said he sued the state, claiming officials at Riverbend
        State Prison wouldn't treat the inmate for stomach
        problems he suffered this summer. </p>
        <p>''He's been asking for treatment for a year,'' Hall
        said. ''They've been refusing to give treatment or a
        diagnosis to see what is wrong.'' </p>
        <p>Jerry Ray said his brother isn't receiving life
        support at this time, but he will OK it if necessary. </p>
        <p>Jerry Ray and James Earl Ray's attorneys are hoping a
        hearing in February will start the process of clearing
        him in King's death. The hearing won't go forward if
        James Earl Ray dies. </p>
        <p>The Rev. Jesse Jackson said earlier this week that he
        was hoping for a deathbed confession from Ray. Jackson
        said he never believed Ray acted alone and blames
        authorities for allowing conspirators to escape. </p>
        <p>Ray's brother said he hopes Jackson doesn't hold his
        breath waiting because ''he won't confess to something he
        didn't do.'' </p>
        <p>Ray admitted to being the sniper that fired the shots
        that killed King on April 4, 1968, while on the balcony
        of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. King was in the city to
        support a strike by sanitation workers. </p>
        <p>Ray was sentenced to 99 years in prison after the
        confession, which he has been trying to recant ever
        since. </p>
        <p>He was serving time at Riverbend Maximum-Security
        Prison until last weekend, when he was transferred from a
        prison medical hospital. </p>

        Authorities said the 23-year-old husband, whose identity
        was being withheld pending contact by authorities with
        his mother, was shot several times with a 12-gauge
        shotgun. The shooting occurred during an argument that
        erupted between the two men. </p>
        <p>The boyfriend, whose identity was not released, was
        taken into custody for questioning. </p>
        <p>The wife, whose identity also was being withheld, also
        was being interviewed by detectives with the Knox County
        Sheriff's Department. </p>
        <p>Detectives speculate the wife was hiding the children
        from her husband, who tried three times to see them
        Thursday at Black Oak Mobile Home Park, 3700 Rifle Range
        Road, said Knox County Sheriff Tim Hutchison. </p>
        <p>Hutchison said the husband's inability to see his
        children the day after Christmas may have triggered the
        argument. </p>
        <p>Hutchison said a man who took the victim to the
        trailer park saw part of what occurred at the trailer and
        outlined what details he could for investigators. </p>
        <p>''The shooting was the result of an argument,''
        Hutchison said. </p>
        <p>The boyfriend is the suspect in the fatal shooting,
        Hutchison said. </p>
        <p>The shooting was reported to the E-911 Center at 4:21
        p.m. </p>
        <p>Kim Brill, a resident, said she heard two gunshots,
        then saw deputies when they arrived. </p>
        <p>''They ran out of their cars with their guns out of
        their holsters,'' she said. </p>
        <p>According to Hutchison, authorities were called to the
        residence on Christmas Eve to quell a domestic
        disturbance. </p>
        <p>Residents of the trailer park stood outside in the
        rain as investigators continued their probe into the
        shooting, leaving many to wonder who had been shot. </p>
        <p>The body was taken to University of Tennessee Medical
        Center by Rural/Metro Ambulance Service at 5:30 p.m. </p>

        <font size="5">R</font>efund and exchange seekers, armed
        with shopping bags brimming with Christmas gifts that
        didn't quite hit their mark, flooded area malls and
        retail stores Thursday to unload the items. </p>
        <p>Clothes that were too big, too small, the wrong color,
        the wrong brand and just plain ugly drove thousands of
        people to say, ''Ooohh thanks, I love it,'' on Wednesday
        and ''Excuse me, but I'd like to return this'' the day
        after. </p>
        <p>''I'm returning a blouse from my mother-in-law,'' said
        a woman who wished to remain anonymous as she stood in
        the standing ever-growing return line at Wal-Mart on
        Millertown Pike. ''I'm telling her it's too small, but
        the truth is I hate it.'' </p>
        <p>''The only thing she can give me that I like is money.
        I know that's a terrible thing to say, but it's the
        truth.'' </p>
        <p>A too-small Tigger sweatshirt brought 14-year-old
        Summer Shadix to East Towne Mall for an exchange. She
        also planned to get a refund on a ''really big purse''
        given to her by her grandmother. </p>
        <p>Knoxville's Jack Peterson wore a weary look as he
        waited in line at the West Town Mall Sears store. </p>
        <p>''This mall is a mad house and the parking lot is even
        worse,'' he said, tapping his foot in frustration. ''I
        wouldn't be here, but Santa goofed. I asked for a snake
        light and he brought me a deluxe screwdriver set
        instead.'' </p>
        <p>John Aultom, store manager of Circuit City in West
        Knoxville, said more people are exchanging gifts rather
        than returning them for a refund. </p>
        <p>Target Guest Service Manager Liz Voiles reported the
        opposite. </p>
        <p>''So far it's been mostly refunds,'' she said. ''We
        started off really slow, but the lines are starting to
        grow.'' </p>
        <p>Refunds and exchanges weren't the only magnets pulling
        people to stores. </p>
        <p>For many, the bargains offered at after Christmas
        sales proved to be the biggest attraction. </p>
        <p>By 11 a.m., Kay Farmer of Knoxville had a truckload of
        drastically reduced Christmas goodies that included
        wreaths, candles, ornaments and gifts for next year. </p>
        <p>''Usually I have to work the day after Christmas,''
        Farmer said from the bustling parking lot of Kmart on
        North Broadway. ''I was off this year, so I decided to
        hit the after-Christmas sales.'' </p>
        <p>Farmer, a grandmother 11 times over, said she'll
        expects to save big on gifts for next Christmas by taking
        advantage of the plethora of sales. </p>
        <p>Alicia Lewis, a 21-year-old University of Tennessee
        student, didn't really care that wrapping paper and
        Christmas decorations at Target in West Knoxville were 50
        percent off. She was shopping for stuffed animals --
        bears in particular. She found a buggy load of them at
        half price. </p>
        <p>''I collect bears. It doesn't really matter what kind,
        just as long as their cute,'' she said. </p>

<!--FIRST STORY TEMPLATE-->        <font size="6"><b>Stinnett sparks Alcoa's romp in
        Christmas Classic opener</b></font><br>
<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Mark Burgess, News-Sentinel
        sportswriter</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>ravis Stinnett learned early what
        not to do in a basketball game. </p>
        <p>With his dad Mark, a longtime Blount County referee,
        all Travis had to do was watch his father at work. </p>
        <p>The problem for Alcoa High School opponents is
        Stinnett also learned the positive intricacies of the
        game. </p>
        <p>As a 6-foot junior guard, Stinnett is averaging 21
        points a game for the Tornadoes (8-1). </p>
        <p>While Alcoa has struggled at times this season to find
        its balance -- following the death of player Dee Swann in
        a car wreck -- Stinnett has been steady. </p>
        <p>He has scored 20-plus points in four games and 33 in a
        victory against Lenoir City. In Alcoa's one loss -- 60-58
        to Graves County, Ky., in an Illinois tournament --
        Stinnett had 17 points at the half and hadn't missed a
        shot. He ended up with 23 points. </p>
        <p>If the Tornadoes hope to make their annual pilgrimage
        to Murfreesboro and the Class 2A state tournament in
        March, they'll be counting on Stinnett and a defense that
        is allowing a paltry average of 40 points a game. </p>
        <p>''We take pride in our defense,'' Stinnett said after
        scoring 17 points in Alcoa's 76-39 victory against
        Sequoyah in the Blount County Christmas Classic at
        Maryville College on Thursday. ''Usually we try to keep
        everybody we play below 55 points, but this year we've
        changed it to 40. </p>
        <p>''We really get after it in practice; we're afraid not
        to. We're similar to the team we had last year in that we
        like to press and get the easy baskets off turnovers.'' </p>
        <p>Sequoyah found that out early. The Chiefs came into
        the game 8-1 and left smarting from the 37-point loss. </p>
        <p>''The key tonight was I thought Travis hit Ken when he
        was open and Ken hit his shots,'' Alcoa coach David Marsh
        said. ''That's something we've been missing because Ken
        hasn't been scoring a lot for us. He has a beautiful
        shot, but he hadn't found his stroke until tonight.'' </p>
        <p>Johnson scored a team-high 18 points for the Tornadoes
        and Quincy McGhee added 16. </p>
        <p><b>ALCOA 37, SEQUOYAH 36: &127;</b>Rachelle Wimbley
        hit a layup with 12 seconds remaining and Sequoyah (6-4)
        missed two final chances for the go-ahead basket. </p>
        <p><b>Elite 8 Tournament at Bearden </b></p>
        <p><b>Boys </b></p>
        <p>PHOENIX III 84, ANDER<b>&127;SON CO. 56: </b>Idris
        Harper, a 6-4 shooting guard, gunned down the Mavericks.
        Harper hit six 3-pointers on his way to a game-high 24
        points in leading the Dragons (10-3). </p>
        <p>Phoenix, a Class 2A state tournament team with
        basically everyone back, took control early with the help
        of Harper's 3-pointers. Eric Garner added 13 points and
        Dewayne Hickman 11. </p>
        <p>Anderson County (5-9) got 12 points from Derek Brewer,
        all on 3-pointers, but the Mavericks couldn't catch
        Phoenix. </p>
        <p>The Dragons are trying to return to the Elite 8
        championship game after losing in the finals to Cleveland
        a year ago. </p>
        <p><b>McMINN COUNTY 59, &127;SOUTH-DOYLE 52: </b>The
        Cherokees ripped away from South-Doyle with a 23-8 run in
        the third quarter. Greg Wilson scored eight of his 16
        points during the burst. </p>
        <p>Matt Waycaster added 13 points. Jan Armstrong and
        Chris Long chipped in 11 apiece for McMinn County (6-5). </p>
        <p>South-Doyle (5-5) had gone cold to start the second
        half, but still managed to cut McMinn County's lead to
        three in the fourth quarter. Tehran Gary had 23 points
        and Nonnie Malone 10 for South-Doyle. </p>
        <p>S-D was playing without guard Chris Tate, who is
        recovering from a sprained ankle injury. </p>
        <p><b>Harry Lane Classic at West </b></p>
        <p><b>CENTRAL 75, WEST 73: &127;</b>Darron Parks of
        Central got a rebound at the buzzer to beat the host
        Rebels in a game that bounced back and forth. </p>
        <p>The Bobcats improved to 9-2 as Cham Johnston and Parks
        scored 15 points apiece. Andujar Shell chipped in 14. </p>
        <p>Central outscored West 28-23 in a wild second quarter.
        The Bobcats survived despite a 27-point night from West
        guard Marlon Bussell and 23 points from Charles Frazier.
        Dedrick Elder added 13 as the Rebels slipped to 5-4. </p>
        <p>West was playing with only six varsity players and
        five junior varsity because of a bout with a flu virus. </p>
        <p><b>FARRAGUT 65, START &127;(OHIO) 63: </b>Brent Watts
        won't soon be forgotten by the team from Start, Ohio. The
        Farragut senior guard lit up Start with 29 points,
        including 20 in the second half. </p>
        <p>Watts had all 15 of Farragut's third-quarter points
        and scored 20 of his points in the second half. His fifth
        3-pointer, with one minute remaining, lifted the Admirals
        (12-1) to the win. Chris Garman added 14 points and Rudy
        Smith 12. </p>
        <p>Start (5-3), of Dayton, Ohio, was led by Tommy Walker
        (23), Ryan Williams (14) and Desmond Harrison (13). </p>

        <font size="5">N</font>ASHVILLE -- In 1949, Gov. Gordon
        Browning arranged for the executive residence to be
        bought for the bargain basement price of $120,000. </p>
        <p>By the early 1970s, Gov. Ray Blanton had moved into
        the mansion. For amusement, he threw live rabbits into
        the pens housing his hunting dogs and laughed at the
        slaughter. </p>
        <p>Gov. Frank Clement allowed his son to raise 150
        chickens in the back yard and was privy to a private
        concert by Elvis Presley. </p>
        <p>Gov. Lamar Alexander, who swept into the residence on
        the eve of scandal, forcing Blanton out amidst charges of
        influence peddling, brought his wife Honey and four
        children, who were allowed the run of the home,
        destroying valuable property. </p>

        width="200" height="100"><br>
        The 15,000-square-foot mansion on 10 acres.</strong></font></p>
        <p>By the time Ned McWherter become governor in 1987, he
        was a widower, and the executive mansion became a single
        pad with an extra-large hot tub installed in the private
        living quarters to accommodate the extra-large governor. </p>
        <p>Today, the home originally built for William Ridley in
        1929 for $150,000 is valued at $1.5 million. It is on its
        way to restoration under First Lady Martha Sundquist. </p>
        <p>''The first lady makes a great deal of difference,''
        said Linda Reed, chairman of the Docents, who conduct
        tours of the residence on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
        ''Browning was a good horse trader. What Blanton did was
        sickening. </p>
        <p>''Honey Alexander had no interest in the residence
        other than as a place to live. Her children were skating
        on the marble and hardwood floors downstairs, (in the
        public rooms) and one of her sons painted the windows in
        his room black.'' </p>
        <p>Martha Sundquist shies from the limelight and would
        rather play golf or bridge than make public appearances.
        She's taken up no major ''cause'' as do some first ladies
        -- unless you consider her work to bring Tennessee to the
        governor's mansion. </p>
        <p>''She's putting Tennessee furniture in the governor's
        residence,'' Reed said. ''She's interested in showing
        Tennessee writers, having Tennessee artisans work on the
        walls -- dulcimers, cornhusk dolls and carvings.'' </p>
        <p>The 10 acres around the 15,000-square-foot mansion on
        Curtiswood Lane in South Nashville already is planted
        with native trees. Under Sundquist's hand, shrubs and
        wildflowers found in the </p>
        <p>Volunteer State have been added. </p>
        <p>Much of the furniture and artwork, although beautiful
        antiques, comes from other areas. During the holidays, a
        profusion of poinsettias fills every room, along with
        many nativity scenes from various countries collected by
        Sundquist. Outside, the governor's home is bedecked with
        red ribbons and live wreaths. </p>
        <p>The latest acquisition -- a huge Tennessee sideboard
        of Cherry and tulip poplar made in 1815, was donated by a
        group of Memphis women. </p>
        <p>The first floor of the public rooms includes a huge
        foyer with black- and white-tiled marble floors, a
        circular, free-standing, solid concrete staircase to the
        second floor, formal dining room, small dining room where
        the Sundquists usually eat, the governor's office, a
        study, formal living room and sunroom. </p>
        <p>The grounds at the rear of the mansion include a
        veranda where no tiles are the same. A reflecting pool,
        swimming pool, pool house, putting green, stable and
        paddock, garages, greenhouse and vegetable and herb
        gardens complete the grounds. </p>
        <p>Martha Sundquist spends most of her time on the
        second-floor sunroom in the governor's living quarters.
        The room faces west and has ''a wonderful view'' of the
        sweeping green lawns surrounding the residence, she said.
        </p>
        <p>When she and the governor moved into the mansion two
        years ago, it took some getting used to. ''I enjoy the
        house very much, but it's not your house,'' she said.
        ''You don't feel like you can mess around and move
        everything around.'' </p>
        <p>The governor said, ''It is like living in a glass
        house. You have to create your own time and activities.
        There's always somebody here, visitors and staff.'' </p>
        <p>Sundquist added he and the first lady often spend time
        alone at the residence without staff on the weekends. </p>
        <p>''It's a privilege to live here. It's the people's
        house,'' he said. </p>
        <p>Since Sundquist was inaugurated in January 1995, the
        state has spent $562,655 on renovations, mostly for
        structural improvements, including a new roof, additional
        security for the first lady and cleaning carpets and
        furniture. </p>
        <p>The Preservation Foundation has spent $56,372 on
        furniture acquisitions in the last two years, and the
        state has received two gifts for the residence, a bed and
        table, worth $13,954. </p>
        <p>McWherter's mother, Lucille, to whom he was very
        close, stayed in the ''green room'' or the ''Elizabeth
        Taylor'' room -- so named because the actress once slept
        there in the 1970s. </p>
        <p>Lucille McWherter died after her son's first year in
        office. Legend has it the room has a ghost, and while the
        governor says he doesn't believe in paranormal activity,
        he says ''strange'' things have happened. For example,
        the light will come on and both he and the first lady
        insist they haven't turned it on. </p>
        <p>The room was decorated in a hideous green by Tish
        Hooker, former decorator and wife of Nashville political
        operative John Jay Hooker. The shag carpeting, walls,
        shades and bedspreads were green. ''We just called it the
        ghastly green room or Tish Hooker's nightmare,'' Reed
        said. </p>
        <p>U.S. Rep. Bob Clement, D-Nashville, remembered his
        father permitted him to raise up to 150 chickens and 150
        turkeys on the grounds of the residence and to give away
        the ''dressed'' turkeys at Thanksgiving. </p>
        <p>''In those days, we had prisoners keep the grounds,''
        Clement recalled. ''All of them were in for murder. They
        were the best prisoners. They would commit a crime and
        never do it again. It was a cheap form of labor.'' </p>
        <p>Clement was 12 years old when Col. Tom Parker brought
        Elvis to the residence to serenade the state's first
        family until 2 a.m. Elvis was ''on the way'' to stardom
        and sang ''Hound Dog'' and other hits with the
        ''Prisoneers,'' a group of inmate songsters each serving
        99 years. </p>
        <p>''They would sing and witness where they went wrong,''
        Clement recalled. ''Then Elvis would sing a version. It
        was quite an experience. It was not a hardship living at
        the residence.'' </p>

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Family hopes to keep Ray alive for new hearings</B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Brother seeks to prove kin not King assassin</FONT><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Jim Patterson, Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- Family members hope James Earl Ray can survive long enough for a hearing they hope will finally start the process of clearing him in the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
<P>    Ray, who confessed to the 1968 shooting death of the civil rights leader and has been trying to recant ever since, remained in a coma in critical condition Wednesday, said Freda Herndon, a spokeswoman for Columbia Nashville Memorial Hospital. Ray, 68, is suffering from liver and kidney damage.
<P>    Jerry Ray said Wednesday he would authorize putting his brother on life-support equipment if necessary. On Tuesday, he said he would refuse such a measure.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The Rev. James Lawson called me from California yesterday,&#39;&#39; Jerry Ray said. &#39;&#39;James&#39; attorney William Pepper called, too, and they convinced me that we had a good chance at a hearing in Memphis on Feb. 20 to clear his name after all these years.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Pepper is trying to get permission from Criminal Court Judge Joseph Brown Jr. to test the murder weapon, which was found with James Earl Ray&#39;s fingerprints.
<P>    Pepper and Ray, who has contended he was a fall guy for the real killers, think that tests on the rifle would prove it was not the murder weapon.
<P>    Prosecutors say the tests are a waste of time and could damage the evidence.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Judge Brown is an honest judge in Memphis,&#39;&#39; Jerry Ray said. &#39;&#39;If James dies, that hearing won&#39;t happen. If James dies, he goes down in history as Martin Luther King&#39;s killer, and that makes the whole Ray family look bad.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Lawson, a Los Angeles pastor who had a church in Memphis in 1968, is one of several black leaders who have said they don&#39;t believe Ray was the assassin. King was killed by sniper fire on April 4, 1968, while on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, where he had gone to support a strike by sanitation workers.
<P>    The Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Joseph Lowery, who founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King, said they held out hope for a deathbed confession from Ray, detailing all he knew about the assassination.
<P>    Ray was sentenced to 99 years in prison after his confession. He was serving time at Riverbend Maximum-Security Prison when he was transferred this weekend from a prison hospital to Columbia.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Right now, he&#39;s breathing a lot better,&#39;&#39; Jerry Ray said. &#39;&#39;But his liver is messed up, they&#39;re pumping blood out of there.&#39;&#39;

<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">K</FONT>INGSPORT -- Tennessee&#39;s largest manufacturer has seen prices fall for one of its main products and, with it, earnings.
<P>    Eastman Chemical Co. will cut costs by $500 million by 2000, company officials say.
<P>    In 1996, the chemical giant saw its earnings drop from record 1995 levels in part because of a drop in prices for PET, or polyethylene terephthalate.
<P>    The chemical is a plastic used in beverage containers and accounts for 20 to 25 percent of Eastman Chemical&#39;s revenues. The company is the largest producer of PET in the world.
<P>    But increased PET production capacity by Eastman Chemical and its competitors drove the price down.
<P>    Chairman Earnie Deavenport, speaking recently to a group of analysts and brokers, said the company would weather the storm.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Even without that very substantial business, you still have a company that is earning nearly $5 per share,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We won&#39;t drop down as low as the analyst community believes we will.&#39;&#39;
<P> For 1995, the company reported earnings of $559 million, or $6.78 per share. For the first three quarters of 1996, Eastman Chemical reported earnings of $320 million or $4.02 per share.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We think that earnings are going to go lower the next couple of years,&#39;&#39; said Les Ravitz of Morgan Stanley.
<P>    In 1997, earnings could be 10 percent lower, he said. He is not sure about the following year.
<P>    Jeff Bedford of Hilliard Lyons in Kingsport was more optimistic. He believes the PET prices are close to bottoming out.
<P>    Company officials say demand for PET will increase.
<P>    Tom Nethery, senior vice president for Eastman Chemical, says, &#39;&#39;Our belief is capacity will tighten up.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Eastman Chemical spun off from Eastman Kodak in 1994. In Tennessee, Eastman Chemical employs about 12,000 at its corporate offices and manufacturing plant in Kingsport.
<P>    Worldwide, the company employs about 18,000 people in 30 countries with U.S. plants in Texas, Arkansas, South Carolina, New York and West Virginia.
<P>    By 2000, the company expects about 3,000 people will have retired or left the company, according to Nethery. Nethery and Deavenport say they don&#39;t anticipate massive layoffs. But some people will be moved to another job and retrained.

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Bohanon gets better with age</B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Oak Ridge back repeats as ET Player of Year</FONT><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Mark Burgess, News-Sentinel sportswriter</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>ak Ridge High School football coach Joe Gaddis was a front-row spectator for Shaun Bohanon&#39;s transformation.
<P>    It didn&#39;t happen overnight.
<P>    It wasn&#39;t like Gaddis saw Bohanon as a freshman four years ago and said, &#39;&#39;This kid is going to be a star.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Bohanon&#39;s journey to the spotlight -- and his second consecutive News-Sentinel East Tennessee Player of the Year award -- was more like winter turning to spring.
<P>    You know it will be special; you just don&#39;t know when it will happen.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I didn&#39;t know he would be this good,&#39;&#39; Gaddis said of Bohanon. &#39;&#39;When I saw Shawn Summers when he was a freshman, I knew he was going to be good. It wasn&#39;t like that with Shaun.
<P>    &#39;&#39;He has improved more and become more of a complete running back than anybody I&#39;ve ever seen.&#39;&#39;
<P>    At 6-foot-2 and 200 pounds, Bohanon raced to a school-record 2,493 yards and 36 touchdowns this season. He was No. 3 on The News-Sentinel Top 25 prospects list and has schools like Tennessee, Alabama, Auburn, Florida and Georgia Tech recruiting him.
<P>    &#39;&#39;He&#39;s the total package,&#39;&#39; Gaddis said. &#39;&#39;As far as a running back goes, he&#39;s about got it all. &#39;&#39;He has great speed, great size and great field vision.
<P>    &#39;&#39;He does a good job changing directions and he can catch the ball coming out of the backfield.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The thing Gaddis said most impressed him about Bohanon this season was watching him mature and hone his skills into the game-breaking back who made defenses reel.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve had the pleasure of watching his instincts develop over the last two years,&#39;&#39; Gaddis said. &#39;&#39;You see him in a game and say, &#39;This must be his best performance,&#39; but he&#39;d always come up with something even better.
<P>    &#39;&#39;He did it all for us, and he did it all very well. But the unique thing about Shaun is he&#39;s as good a person as he is a football player. He has been amazingly unaffected by all the attention he&#39;s been getting.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Gaddis used his own son, Joe, in an example of how hectic things have become for Bohanon.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Joe was over at Shaun&#39;s house and they were trying to play a video game,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;The phone rang seven times (all regarding recruiting) in a matter of a few minutes. They finally just threw up their hands and gave up.&#39;&#39;
<P>    When he&#39;s not answering his phone, Bohanon is getting back into the flow of playing basketball for the Wildcats.
<P>    It&#39;s the sport Bohanon originally thought would be his ticket to stardom. But he fooled everyone, including himself, by becoming the most sought-after running back in East Tennessee.
<P>    Webb School coach David Meske -- The News-Sentinel&#39;s East Tennessee Coach of the Year -- fooled people as well.
<P>    Despite several key injuries, and last-minute losses to Region 2-2A rivals Alcoa and Sweetwater -- he led the Spartans to their second state championship, a Class 2A title with a 27-20 victory against Goodpasture.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This state championship brought our community together like nothing I&#39;ve seen,&#39;&#39; he said before leaving for a holiday trip to Wisconsin. &#39;&#39;People who had no connection whatsoever to Webb School were telling me how much they were rooting for us.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Meske also gave credit to  his assistant coaches and a group of emotional, inspired players.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s all about the kids and it should always be about the kids,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ll never forget being at our awards dinner and having Lloyd Russell (a senior) get up and say the other players were like brothers and the coaches were like fathers.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I looked over at Elwood Pennington and he was wiping his eyes. We can&#39;t ever forget the kids are more important than the game.&#39;&#39;
<P>    
<P>   <B>CLASS 5A:</B> While Bohanon is the choice for 5A player of the year, Jefferson County&#39;s Craig Kisabeth is the coach of the year. The Patriots were 1-3 and 3-4 at various points in the season, but Kisabeth never allowed his team to falter on the way to the state runner-up finish to Brentwood Academy.
<P>    
<P>   <B>CLASS 4A:</B> Halls, state runner-up to Pearl-Cohn, dominates this category with Gary Shephard taking the coaching honors and fullback/linebacker Dustin Johnson the player of the year. Johnson was the leading tackler for the Red Devils and a huge reason the Halls offense set yardage records with his blocking and 800 yards rushing.
<P>   
<P>   <B>CLASS 3A:</B> Travis Adams of Lenoir City was so unstoppable, his final rushing yardage total doesn&#39;t seem real. The number is 2,990 and he&#39;s the 3A Player of the Year. Tim Daniels, coach of rival Loudon, is the Coach of the Year after guiding the Redskins to a 3-3A title and unbeaten regular season.
<P>    
<P>    <B>CLASS 2A:</B> As obvious as 4A, the 2A player and coach of the year go to Webb&#39;s Matt Huskey and Meske.
<P>    Huskey&#39;s importance on both sides of the ball for the Spartans gave him the edge over Oliver Springs&#39; Eric Miller (2,900 yards rushing).
<P>    
<P>    <B>CLASS 1A:</B> Mike Lunsford led Cloudland to a perfect regular season and is the 1A coach honoree.
<P>    His quarterback/defensive back, Mr. Football candidate Robbie Turbyfill, is the player of the year after throwing for  1,000 yards and intercepting 11 passes.

        <font size="5">D</font>espite rain in the predawn hours
        of Christmas Eve, sunny spirits were bountiful as
        hundreds of people lined up for their Empty Stocking Fund
        baskets Tuesday and hundreds of others volunteered to
        hand them out. </p>
        <p>''It wouldn't seem like Christmas without all this,''
        said Farragut High School senior Darcey West, in her
        fourth year of volunteering for the Empty Stocking Fund
        on Christmas Eve. </p>
        <p>''This is what you are supposed to be doing at
        Christmas,'' said Kelvey Stewart, also a Farragut senior.
        </p>
        <p>Not to be outdone, Bearden High School sent almost 100
        Key Club members, alumni and parent volunteers to help
        distribute 3,500 food baskets and $43,000 worth of toys. </p>
        <p>Anna Vazquez, a 1992 Bearden High graduate, came all
        the way from Japan, where she is on a two-week leave from
        her job teaching English in a small town on the island of
        Kyushu. </p>
        <p>For Steve Arnett of Forest Brook in West Knoxville,
        the tradition of spending the morning before Christmas
        with the Empty Stocking Fund has lasted 29 years,
        beginning when he was 9 years old. </p>
        <p>His grandmother, Edna Arnett, purchased food for the
        Empty Stocking Fund baskets for many years. Generations
        of her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren
        have carried on the tradition of aiding the fund. </p>
        <p>For some families this year, volunteering to assist
        the Empty Stocking Fund on Christmas Eve is the start of
        a tradition. </p>
        <p>Marilyn Gallaher, a home health nurse at the
        University of Tennessee Medical Center, spent Monday
        delivering baskets to her homebound patients. On
        Christmas Eve she was joined by her new husband as they
        added frozen turkeys to the already stuffed food baskets
        at the Jacob Building in Chilhowee Park. </p>
        <p>''I guess this is our first family Christmas
        tradition,'' she said. </p>
        <p>Charles Adams of Powell, retired from Stokes Electric
        Co., said he'll be back to volunteer again next Christmas
        Eve. </p>
        <p>The volunteers were put to good use packing and
        carrying food baskets and helping choose toys for
        families, whose members began lining up in Chilhowee Park
        at 3 a.m. Tuesday. </p>
        <p>Mary Horton of Western Avenue said her little girl,
        Chelsea, 7, wasn't expecting any Christmas this year. She
        encouraged her mom to spend any available money on
        5-year-old Trey, a big believer in Santa. </p>
        <p>''She knows about Santa Claus,'' said Horton of
        Chelsea. ''She said, 'Mommy, I know you don't make any
        money. You give Trey the presents.' '' </p>
        <p>Thanks to the Empty Stocking Fund, however, Chelsea --
        whose birthday falls on Christmas Eve -- will get a
        Christmas tea set and a jeweled angel pin. </p>
        <p>Six-year-old Matthew Hammock of Mechanicsville came
        with his grandmother to pick from toys Santa left at the
        Jacob Building. His mom was in the hospital after
        delivering Matthew's new baby brother in time for
        Christmas. </p>
        <p>Matthew picked out a cuddly stuffed puppy and a
        longed-for football. </p>
        <p>Anne Bernard was delighted to find a tool set, wished
        for by her 7-year-old son, Cory. As a bonus, she got
        hand-knitted hats for everyone in the family, including
        one for her month-old baby. </p>
        <p>While food, toys and warm hats went home with
        families, the hundreds of volunteers went home with warm
        hearts for Christmas. </p>
        <p>Hershell Johnson, a retired Aquatic Center
        administrator from UT and a Red Cross volunteer, says he
        wouldn't miss it. </p>
        <p>''This kind of gets under your skin. The satisfaction
        you get from seeing the expression on everyone's face
        really makes it special.'' </p>

        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">C</font>hristmas came to the Knoxville
        Union Rescue Mission this year as a vanload of blue
        jeans. </p>
        <p>The pants -- between 500 and 600 pair -- arrived
        courtesy of Jerry Lucas, owner of Fleas Unlimited in
        Sweetwater. </p>
        <p>''They're overruns,'' Lucas said. ''They don't have
        labels, but they're high quality. I was going to re-sell
        them, but I figured this was a better way to put them to
        use.'' </p>
        <p>Jerry Lucas, his brother Keith and their friend Johnny
        Shelton arrived in Knoxville at noon after a two-hour
        drive from Sweetwater. As the lunch crowd at the mission
        heard they were coming, they moved out in the parking
        lot, where sleet was mixing with freezing rain. </p>
        <p>The buzz word was free pants. </p>
        <p>''Anybody wear a size 38-by-30?'' said Keith Lucas,
        handing out jeans from the back of the van. ''Do we have
        some big boy sizes out there?'' </p>
        <p>One of the blue jean recipients was Joey Trillo, a
        nine-month resident of the Knoxville Union Rescue Mission
        who said he was delighted to find a pair in his size. </p>
        <p>''I had faith in God they would,'' Trillo said. ''New
        pants are hard to come by.'' </p>
        <p>Jerry Lucas said he made the blue jean run as a means
        of counting his blessings. A year ago his flea market was
        hit by a fire that burned more than 100,000 square feet.
        Lucas never expected to rebuild, but after eight months,
        he's back in time for Christmas. </p>
        <p>''I thought I had lost it all,'' he said. ''We have
        over 300 dealers, and this is our way of giving. We wish
        we could give more.'' </p>
        <p>After an hour, the line of people waiting for a pair
        of jeans still stretched across the parking lot. </p>
        <p>''This is a tough time of year for these folks,'' said
        Victor Howard, director of development for Knox Area
        Rescue Ministries. ''They get to thinking about all the
        Christmases past, which were real sad, and they just want
        to forget.'' </p>

        fares</b></font><br>
<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Richard Powelson, News-Sentinel
        Washington bureau</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">W</font>ASHINGTON -- The 10 percent
        federal tax on airline tickets expires at the end of the
        month, but consumers should not expect widespread fare
        discounts. </p>
        <p>In fact, several major airlines, including Delta and
        Northwest, already have boosted prices 10 percent on
        advance tickets for early 1997 travel. </p>
        <p>When Congress allowed the tax to expire at the end of
        last year, it did not resume it until Aug. 27. </p>
        <p>The tax provides about $500 million a month in
        revenues, mostly used for airport improvements. </p>
        <p>Airlines also did not uniformly lower fares during the
        last no-tax period. </p>
        <p>For example, Southwest Airlines, one of the discount
        fare airlines, did not lower its fares in the first eight
        months of this year based on the tax change, while Delta
        Airlines said it did lower its fares during part of the
        no-tax period. </p>
        <p>''Generally we always have the lowest fares anyway,''
        said Southwest spokeswoman Amy Lyons. ''We did not know
        if it (the tax) was going to come back or not . . . or if
        it would be put back and be retroactive. So we didn't
        change anything.'' </p>
        <p>Delta spokesman Todd Clay said the stronger economy
        and lower airfares in the first half of the year helped
        the airline attract 14 percent more passengers than in
        the same period of 1995, rising to 35 million customers. </p>
        <p>''When the economy is good, airline travel is good,''
        Clay said. </p>
        <p>Many airlines have reported healthy profits for the
        year. </p>
        <p>Federal agencies are not required to monitor airfares
        in the deregulated industry and allow competition between
        airlines to prompt lower fares along popular routes. </p>
        <p>Rep. John J. Duncan Jr., R-Tenn., chairman of the
        aviation subcommittee of the Transportation and
        Infrastructure Committee, said it is difficult for
        consumers to know what effect a temporary expiration of
        the federal tax has on air fares. </p>
        <p>''You have such fluctuations and variations in these
        ticket prices,'' he said. </p>
        <p>Routes with stiff competition tend to have ''price
        wars'' among the airlines serving those cities, while
        customers with one dominant carrier at their airport tend
        to pay higher fares most of the time, he said. </p>
        <p>''What they seem to do is . . . make most of their
        money on people who fly out of non-hub cities like
        Knoxville and other similar-size cities across the
        country,'' Duncan said. </p>
        <p>''Most of the time you can find a much cheaper ticket
        to fly from Washington (D.C.) out to California than you
        can to fly from Washington to Knoxville,'' he said. </p>
        <p>Both the airline industry and consumer groups agree
        competition affects airfares more than whether the
        federal ticket tax is in effect. </p>
        <p>The tax helps fund renovation, expansion and safety
        improvements at airports across the country, as well as
        support operations of the Federal Aviation
        Administration. </p>
        <p>''Competition is the determining factor'' on fare
        levels, said David Fuscus of the industry-supported Air
        Transport Association. </p>
        <p>The Aviation Consumer Action Project, a Ralph
        Nader-founded group that monitors consumer issues in the
        industry, agreed. </p>
        <p>''On routes with no strong competition, a major
        airline has no incentive to lower the fare when the (10
        percent federal) tax expires temporarily,'' said the
        group's spokesman, Robert Di Vito. </p>
        <p>The consumer group early this year reminded fliers
        that they are entitled to refunds of the federal tax if
        they bought tickets before the tax expired for travel
        when the tax was not in effect. </p>
        <p>Congress next year may revise how the 10 percent tax
        is imposed rather than just renewing it. </p>
        <p>The seven major airlines have asked for changes that
        would end the flat 10 percent charge on each fare and
        instead impose a user fee based on a formula using
        numbers of passengers and miles flown. </p>
        <p>The seven major carriers are American, Continental,
        Delta, Northwest, Trans World Airlines, United Airlines
        and USAir. </p>
        <p>The proposed formula would lower the tax for
        passengers on some airlines and raise it for those on
        others, particularly the discount airlines. </p>
        <p>Southwest is among the discount airlines opposing any
        change in how the tax is assessed. </p>
        <p>''The excise tax has worked without consumer complaint
        for 26 years,'' said Southwest spokeswoman Ginger
        Hardage. ''It (the major carriers' proposed change) has
        the potential for punishing low-fare flyers.'' </p>
        <p>Duncan said he will not take a position on whether to
        change how the tax is imposed until after his
        subcommittee holds hearings sometime early next year. </p>

        <font size="5">O</font>nce again it's Christmas morning
        and all is not merry with the Knoxville Cherokees. It's
        as obvious as Rudolph's nose. </p>
        <p>The East Coast Hockey League team is in the grips of a
        gut-wrenching seven-game losing streak and mired at the
        bottom of the Eastern Division with a 11-14-1 record. </p>
        <p>Disgruntled players have pointed fingers at each other
        and fans have vented their frustration at coach Barry
        Smith. The atmosphere is anything but jolly. </p>
        <p>With only one road victory -- a shootout win at
        Raleigh -- in 10 tries this season and a horrific 12-game
        road trip in March to end the regular season, it doesn't
        take a hockey genius, only a sportswriter, to figure out
        the playoffs are a pipe dream at this point. </p>
        <p>Smith, who is in his fifth year in Knoxville, is no
        stranger to this situation. It was just a year ago that
        the struggling Cherokees did an about-face after the
        holidays, won a first-round playoff series -- the first
        in the franchise's eight-year history -- against the
        Nashville Knights and gave Toledo all it wanted before
        being eliminated. </p>
        <p>Deja vu? </p>
        <p>Maybe. </p>
        <p>Although another turnaround is possible, it is more
        unlikely because of Knoxville's move from the Southern
        Division. There are no creampuffs in the East to fatten
        up on. </p>
        <p>The 1995-96 Cherokees were a talented group of
        first-half underachievers. But they had a nucleus and the
        Chop Line of Kim Maier, Jim Brown and Frank LaScala.
        Maier and Brown were 50-goal scorers and LaScala's
        leadership may have been as much a force as his 45 goals
        scored. </p>
        <p>Smith, to his credit, orchestrated the reclamation
        project. He began rounding up reinforcements. </p>
        <p>Feisty playmaker Bob Wren and forwards Dale Junkin and
        Vaclav Nedomansky were the offensive pickups. </p>
        <p>The defense was shored up by the importation of
        blueliner Kent Fearns. Steve Cheredaryk, a NHL draft pick
        who is considerd one of the Phoenix Coyotes' 10 best
        prospects, was another defenseman added for the stretch
        run. </p>
        <p>Another critical piece of the puzzle was unknown
        rookie Brad Guzda, who incredibly won 16 of 17 games in
        goal. </p>
        <p>The holdovers also stepped it up. Doug Searle, for
        example, became as dependable a stay-at-home defenseman
        as you'd expect to find in the ECHL. </p>
        <p>Exactly 365 days ago, it was an analytical piece in
        your favorite morning newspaper which ruffled the
        feathers of the coach and players. In a nutshell, the
        no-holds-barred commentary suggested the players put up
        or shut up. </p>
        <p>The coach blew his stack and players gave the scribe
        with the poisonous laptop the cold shoulder. But at least
        the team was unified. </p>
        <p>This season's edition is a defensive nightmare. Goals
        are being scoring at a near-record pace and everyone from
        goalies to forwards is to blame. </p>
        <p>So is the coach. He miscalculated when he traded
        Searle and defenseman Sean Brown to Roanoke for forward
        Ole Kjenstad during the preseason. </p>
        <p>Kjenstad is gritty and skilled. But when Fearns, the
        team's best defenseman was called up to Las Vegas, and
        injuries hit hard along the blue line -- rookie Kelly
        Hollingshead is out for the season and Jamie Bird has
        played only sparingly -- the team fell apart. In fact, it
        hasn't won since Fearns' departure. </p>
        <p>The offense also is sputtering. </p>
        <p>Stripped of their confidence, the Cherokees have no
        spunk. The bone-jarring collisions, which rattled the
        plexiglass in November, have been replaced by soft
        shoulder rubs. Battles are being lost in the corners and
        special teams are in disarray. </p>
        <p>Smith again must make changes if he is to rejuvenate
        this team. Those who refuse to play with pride when they
        put on their jersey should find a pink slip under the
        Christmas tree. </p>
        <p>A year ago, Cory Cadden, who holds most of the
        goaltending records and is one of Knoxville's all-time
        favorite players, was put on leave and eventually let go.
        It sent the message there were no sacred cows. </p>
        <p>A trade -- not for the sake of a shakeup, but for
        obtaining a quality defenseman -- is mandatory. Smith
        needs a couple of snowplows to keep the front of the net
        cleared. </p>
        <p>''That (trade) is something Barry is going to have to
        decide,'' said Jim Brown, the team's second-leading
        scorer. ''He's the coach, he's the big man and he makes
        the decisions. Whatever he has to do to turn this thing
        around . . .'' </p>
        <p>And soon. </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Pam Park, News-Sentinel business
        writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">D</font>eRoyal Industries Inc., a
        Powell-based health-care products manufacturer, has
        licensed two inventions from Oak Ridge National
        Laboratories that will allow more efficient use of
        radioisotopes in medical tests. </p>
        <p>Pete DeBusk, DeRoyal president and chief executive
        officer, said the market for them will be global. </p>
        <p>He expects sales of $75 million to $100 million
        annually for the concentrator concept, which will be on
        the market within 12 to 15 months, and a much greater
        market for the generators, which he will produce in Oak
        Ridge in two to three years. </p>
        <p>''In DeRoyal's opinion, ORNL has hit a home run with
        its development of a better, less costly way to deliver
        the radioisotopes used in medical diagnostic imaging,''
        DeBusk said. </p>
        <p>ORNL improved the method of concentrating technetium,
        a radioactive isotope used to perform 10 million medical
        tests per year. The technologies also are expected to
        simplify the production process and extend the life of
        technetium generators -- the containers in which the
        element is shipped and stored. It would extend the life
        of the generator up to 20 percent, providing less waste
        and more patient doses at lower cost. </p>
        <p>The production technology is expected to produce less
        waste than former processes. </p>
        <p>Emory Collins of ORNL's Chemical Technology Division
        and Saed Mirzadeh, Russ Knapp, Arnold Beets and Stefan
        Guhke of the Health Sciences Research Division invented
        the two technologies. </p>
        <p>DeBusk would not confirm the potential location of the
        generator plant, but reindustrialization and
        privatization efforts at Oak Ridge have opened up empty
        buildings, particularly at the K-25 site, for lease by
        private companies. </p>
        <p>He estimates 30 to 50 people would be employed in
        producing the concentrator. </p>
        <p>Producing the generator is the second phase, said
        Brian DeBusk, chief operating officer. First, the company
        must gain clinical acceptance and regulatory approvals
        for the concentrator. </p>
        <p>X-rays used in cat scans are good at differentiating
        bones; MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) can
        differentiate structure that has different water
        concentrations; and nuclear medicine focuses on activity
        and is a complement to other kinds of tests, Brian DeBusk
        said. </p>
        <p>Doctors mix technetium with a pharmaceutical element
        that collects in a specific organ of the body, such as
        the heart or brain, and a gamma camera is used to pick up
        areas of high metabolism. For example, if a kidney is
        damaged, a doctor can use nuclear medicine to see what
        portions of the kidney are active. </p>
        <p>High technology medicine is a new strategic direction
        for DeRoyal. Its current products include surgical
        procedural trays and accessories, orthopedic goods,
        critical-care and wound-care products and computer
        software for hospitals. </p>

        settle lawsuit</b></font><br>
<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Randy Kenner, News-Sentinel staff
        writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">A</font> Knoxville-based charity has
        agreed to a $180,000 settlement of a 1995 lawsuit
        accusing it of defrauding New Yorkers who donated money
        to help cancer patients. </p>
        <p>However, the president of the Cancer Fund of America
        said Monday that CFA denied wrongdoing and settled
        because it was cheaper than going to trial. </p>
        <p>''I talked to our attorney (Andy Lipps) in Washington,
        and he said we'd probably be looking at a quarter of a
        million dollars to fight it,'' said James Reynolds,
        president of the charity. </p>
        <p>Reynolds also said the settlement money will be
        donated to charity, which is what the CFA wanted anyway. </p>
        <p>''That's the primary reason,'' he said. </p>
        <p>The settlement was announced Sunday by New York
        Attorney General Dennis Vacco, whose office oversees
        groups that solicit money in the state. </p>
        <p>According to Vacco, the settlement calls for $180,000
        to be paid to the attorney general's office over the next
        five years. The agreement still has to be approved by a
        New York court. </p>
        <p>The New York settlement is the latest involving the
        CFA, which has now settled lawsuits with at least 17
        states since 1989 over its fund-raising activities. </p>
        <p>Those include settlements in which the CFA agreed to
        pay $187,500 to Pennsylvania, $82,500 to Connecticut and
        $40,000 to Texas. </p>
        <p>The CFA also was one of eight charitable groups that
        agreed to pay $2.1 million to settle lawsuits over
        deceptive fund-raising practices filed by 10 states. </p>
        <p>Reynolds said CFA paid about $1 million in that
        settlement and paid roughly $150,000 to settle lawsuits
        in Missouri, Hawaii and Ohio. </p>
        <p>He said there are no other lawsuits pending against
        the small organization that raises funds throughout the
        United States. </p>
        <p>The CFA uses the money to buy supplies for hospices
        and individual cancer patients and for educational
        materials, Reynolds said. </p>
        <p>He said CFA helped about 450 to 500 hospices and about
        1,000 individuals last year. </p>
        <p>The New York lawsuit alleged CFA engaged in
        solicitations fraud in its fund-raising activities. </p>
        <p>''CFA has sought to mislead the public by grossly
        inflating the extent of its charitable activities in
        order to appear far more efficient than was actually the
        case,'' the lawsuit said. </p>
        <p>It accused the organization of inflating the value of
        donations it made to other charities and how much it
        actually spent on cancer programs. </p>
        <p>Among the donated items were stale vegetable seeds,
        damaged books and obsolete medical equipment, according
        to Vacco. </p>
        <p>''The public was led to believe by CFA's false filings
        that 47 to 56 percent of its revenues were going to help
        cancer patients, when, in fact, only 13 to 17 percent of
        its money was spent on charitable programs,'' Vacco said.
        </p>
        <p>Reynolds, however, said roughly 60 percent of $6
        million that CFA collected last year went to cancer
        patients directly or in the form of medical goods donated
        to hospices. </p>
        <p>He said educational materials also were included in
        that figure, and CFA also contributes goods to other
        charities. </p>

        Bristol Motor Speedway has taken on the look of a war

        eventually boost seating capacity to 130,000 for the
        Goody's 500 in August, is well ahead of schedule. Smith,
        who purchased the facility in February, promised 110,000
        seats would be in position for the April running of the
        Food City 500. That figure has been increased to 118,000.
        </p>
        <p>''In six months (from the start of construction) we
        hope to have accomplished much more than anticipated,''
        vice president and general manager Jeff Byrd said.
        ''Concrete footings have been finished for completion of
        12,000 aluminum seats in turns one and two.'' </p>
        <p>All original seating areas in turns three and four
        have been removed in order to increase capacity.
        Twenty-six thousand seats in that section will be ready
        for the early Winston Cup race, and another 12,000
        finished later for the fall event. </p>
        <p>And it's not just seats. As many as 25 skybox suites
        with elevators will be completed in turn four before
        April, another 30 -- most likely a greater number -- in
        turn three and the front stretch. New concession stands
        and rest rooms also have been a priority. </p>
        <p>Wes Harris, who heads up suite construction, said,
        ''We could build a couple more before then if they're
        sold.'' </p>
        <p>Removal of thousands of tons of earth and rock has
        created the biggest project, but that will be taken care
        of in the near future. </p>
        <p>''Grandstand construction has been no trouble at all.
        There have been no safety problems,'' said Wayne Estes,
        director of communication. ''Everything has been safe all
        along (including the replacement of stands in turns three
        and four). We've got the best people in the business
        right now. We have on-going discussions searching for
        ways to make things better. We've also talked to people
        in regard to future plans.'' </p>
        <p>The Bristol track, with the high speeds and sheetmetal
        swapping, is known as the most-difficult on the Winston
        Cup circuit to secure tickets. Indications are it will
        remain that way -- don't be surprised if another 10,000
        seats will be ready for races in 1998. </p>
        <p>''Getting tickets for the races is like getting them
        for the Masters (golf tournament) and UT football,''
        Estes said. ''The request for tickets has been as high as
        84,000 (on a waiting list). Without public advertisements
        we sold 32,000 tickets and 128,000 in a month for four
        races (two Cup and two Busch series events) in a season
        package.'' </p>
        <p>Until the loop around Bristol is completed race
        traffic will remain a problem, but track officials are
        seeking ways to handle it. </p>
        <p>''We're seeking every way to parking areas, including
        sites on nearby pastures to help handle it,'' Estes said,
        ''in hopes of getting the people out as quickly as
        possible.'' </p>
        <p>Future improvements include removing the current press
        box and adjacent suites to close in the gap between the
        front stretch and turn one with seats, and a new infield
        media center. </p>
        <p>''The entire infield will be redone in the future,''
        Estes said, ''but there has been no bid at this time.'' </p>
        <p>Safety isn't being overlooked while millions of
        dollars are going into the improvements. </p>
        <p>The concrete retaining wall down the backstretch,
        which has been perpendicular (90 degrees), is being
        replaced. The new wall starts at the end of the second
        turn where Michael Waltrip survived a vicious crash
        several years ago. </p>
        <p>The wall will be leaning 16 degrees toward the
        infield, a change that will increase safety for drivers
        and fans alike should a car crash into the wall. </p>
        <p>In the future, the front stretch wall likely will be
        replaced should the concrete deteriorate. </p>
        <p>There have been complaints from Winston Cup and
        drivers representing other series regarding the concrete
        racing surface which is referred to as a one-groove
        track. </p>
        <p>''Drivers who want to get to the front run in the high
        groove,'' Byrd said. ''A good example was when Dale
        Jarrett started 34th (in a Busch race) and made it to the
        front here in August.'' </p>
        <p>Said Estes, ''Until we get a company to guarantee its
        asphalt will last, the track will remain concrete.'' </p>
        <p>A multi-million-dollar roof over the track is still on
        the list of future improvements. </p>
        <p>Two German companies that specialize in such
        construction have shown interest in the project which
        would cost somehwere between $20 and 25 million. </p>
        <p>''It would be a real challenge,'' Byrd said, ''but
        apparently there would be no problem in running a race.
        The cover also would be a great asset for other events.''

        <p><font size="2"><i>By Morgan Simmons, News-Sentinel
        staff writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">D</font>UCKTOWN, Tenn. -- </p>
        <p>It's a promising sign for the Ocoee Whitewater Center
        that Frank Lewis is busier now than he was during the
        Olympics. </p>
        <p>More than 20,000 people have visited the facility
        since it opened less than two months ago, and Lewis, the
        U.S. Forest Service ranger for the Ocoee District of the
        Cherokee National Forest, said he expects the turnout to
        be even greater in the spring. </p>
        <p>''The response so far has been tremendous,'' said
        Lewis. ''I think a lot of people were waiting for the
        Olympics to be over so they could come out and see what
        they had been reading about.'' </p>
        <p>Today the Ocoee Whitewater Center bears little
        resemblance to the site that welcomed 14,000 people a day
        during last summer's Olympic slalom races. Gone are the
        bleachers, the air-conditioned tents and the wooden
        platforms that supported the television cameras. </p>
        <p>What's left are the permanent structures built by the
        U.S. Forest Service -- the 1,700-foot stretch of
        artifically enhanced river channel, the paved walkways
        and, most prominent of all, the administration building,
        which opened October 12 as a tourist information center
        for Polk County and the seven-county surrounding area. </p>
        <p>''The whitewater center was built for more than the
        three days of the Olympics,'' said Lewis. ''The primary
        reason for the forest service becoming involved with the
        project was to develop tourism in a regional context.'' </p>
        <p>For more than a year, a future-use study has been
        under way to develop land- and water-based recreational
        activities on the upper Ocoee River and the surrounding
        Cherokee National Forest. </p>
        <p>The study -- conducted by the forest service in
        cooperation with the Tennessee Valley Authority and the
        state of Tennessee -- has outlined various levels of
        development of horse, mountain bike and hiking trails and
        campground use, as well as water-based alternatives
        ranging from no regularly scheduled water releases to
        full-fledged commercial rafting on the upper Ocoee. </p>
        <p>The future use study is expected to be finished by
        spring. It's to followed by another plan outlining
        funding and management. In the meantime, the Ocoee
        Whitewater Center is being put to good use. </p>
        <p>Staffed entirely by volunteers provided through the
        Polk County Chamber of Commerce, the center's
        7,600-square-foot administration building is an
        interpretive center, gift shop and museum -- all
        dedicated to the sport of whitewater slalom racing. </p>
        <p>The center's first four weeks drew 600 people a day,
        along with another 507 who came on the day after
        Thanksgiving. </p>
        <p>So far, about half of the Ocoee Whitewater Center's
        visitors have been from out-of-state. The administration
        building's conference room has been rented out for
        various functions, including a family reunion. The paved
        walkways along the slalom course have proved popular with
        folks who just want to picnic or go for a stroll. </p>
        <p>Part of the $14 million the forest service spent on
        the whitewater center was used to turn 2.4 miles of the
        Old Copper Road into a graded trail that begins at the
        administration building and follows the Ocoee River
        upstream. </p>
        <p>Lewis said that while any additional trail
        construction or water releases would have to await the
        outcome of the future- use environmental study, there is
        much that can be done with the whitewater center just as
        it is now. </p>
        <p>Volunteers are developing an educational outreach
        program to bring school groups onto the site to study the
        geology of the area and learn about the native gardens
        that decorate the grounds. </p>
        <p>This spring the forest service will explore the
        possiblility of renting out mountain bikes to visitors.
        Lewis said he also would love to see a 5-kilometer foot
        race established which would start at the Old Copper Road
        and follow a loop around the competition channel. </p>
        <p>''There is no other forest service facility in the
        world like this tied into a former Olympic venue,'' he
        said. ''The way I see it, we're limited only by our
        imaginations.'' </p>

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Smokies to study Cades Cove deer herd&#39;s effect on plants</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>ADES COVE -- Most rural fences are built to keep animals in.
<P>   In the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, fences are being erected for the opposite purpose.
<P>   Park personnel are building fences to keep the deer out. In this case, the deer will only be excluded from eight relatively small &#39;&#39;exclosures&#39;&#39; in Cades Cove.
<P>    The 50-by-50-foot areas will be surrounded by eight-foot wire fences that allow smaller animals to enter but keep the deer out.
<P>    Park biologist Keith Langdon and his staff will use the areas to study how plants grow in the cove when not subjected to constant browsing by deer.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We&#39;re trying to scientifically determine what the impact of deer browsing is in the area around Cades Cove,&#39;&#39; said Langdon.
<P>   In addition to its historic value, Cades Cove is one of the park&#39;s richest biological sections, he said. Several rare plants grow only in Cades Cove.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Deer have fed on these species to the point where a couple have just about been wiped out,&#39;&#39; said Langdon. &#39;&#39;One is a purple orchid found in the cove. Last year we found just one plant which has sort of survived.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We also have had the Virginia chain fern here. It&#39;s known on the Atlantic coast, but here its been wiped out by deer.&#39;&#39; 
<P>
<P>   When summer comes, park biologists will survey the plants in the fenced areas, then return regularly to keep track of their survival and growth.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This is something that will take many years to do,&#39;&#39; said Langdon. He expects the fenced areas to be maintained for at least 20 years.
<P>   
<P>   The Smokies is one of four national parks that have been designated long-term monitoring parks.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We do this for rare plants in Cades Cove, some . . . fish species and more,&#39;&#39; said Langdon. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re kind of a special park in the National Park Service.&#39;&#39;
<P>    He stressed that there are no plans to remove deer from the Cades Cove area.

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>By rehiring Jobs, Apple Computer tries to put smile back on Mac users</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By DAVID E. KALISH, AP Business Writer</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>EW YORK (AP) -- Some people treat their Macintosh computers more like pets. They paint them in nice designer colors. Even name them.
<P>    Turn on the machine, and a small Macintosh icon smiles at you.
<P>    But inroads by rivals have started to put a frown on the famous Mac icon -- spurring Apple Computer Inc. to take the most surprising gamble in its 20-year history.
<P>    Aiming to rebuild its aging software and restore faith among edgy users, Apple on Friday rehired none other than Mac father Steve Jobs -- the original creator of the 1984 computer billed as a liberation from unfriendly technology.
<P>    Jobs was pushed out of the company 11 years ago, and whether he actually helps Apple reclaim its glory days remains to be seen. But just the fact Mr. Mac is returning is heady news to graphic artists, designers and other loyalists.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I&#39;m kind of excited actually,&#39;&#39; said Frank Chiachiere, 18, a computer science student at the University of Pennsylvania who has been using Apple computers since he was 8 years old.
<P>    &#39;&#39;They really need to think big. Steve Jobs is good at thinking big... When you&#39;re not the big man on campus, the big game in town, which Microsoft obviously is, you have to be the ones that are changing the rules,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>    Reigniting fervor among fans may be the easier challenge. Technically, Jobs has been hired to help update the Mac&#39;s friendly but aging operating system -- essentially the same one that ran the original Mac 12 years ago.
<P>    The computer&#39;s age is starting to show. While Apple still is the third-largest U.S. PC maker, its market share in recent years has been eroded by rival Microsoft&#39;s development of Windows software that matches many of the easy-to-use features of the Macintosh. Apple has stumbled financially, only recently recovering from nine straight months of losses.
<P>    Apple agreed to pay $400 million for Jobs&#39; company, Next Software Inc., with the goal of blending the Next program into a new operating system that surpasses the competition&#39;s -- and answers growing concerns among Mac users.
<P>    They complain the Mac crashes too often, with the screen suddenly blanking out and losing information that hasn&#39;t been stored in the hard drive. The computer is too slow. There are too few software programs that run on Macs.
<P>    Microsoft&#39;s Windows 95, meanwhile, attracts far more software developers and offers many graphics fancier than the Mac icons that made Apple famous.
<P>    Details of how the Next program will be merged with Mac&#39;s were not divulged -- not even whether the new system will retain the Mac name. Apple said it would sell the new computers sometime next year.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It really remains to be seen exactly what Apple will deliver -- what combination of the old Macintosh and its capabilities with the new stuff,&#39;&#39; said Henry Norr, a columnist for the MacWeek trade publication who has been following Apple since the brand&#39;s 1984 introduction.
<P>    The Next program is expected to answer several concerns, including reducing crashes, accelerating functions and delivering the ability to &#39;&#39;multitask&#39;&#39; -- run several different functions at once.
<P>    Norr noted there may be disappointment with the fact that the Next software has not demonstrated an ability to smoothly operate with more than one microprocessor at once. This type of computer processing was offered by Be Inc., another computer company that Apple had sought as a possible merger partner. Multiprocessing is a benefit to companies that need extra computer power to run their business programs.
<P>    Conversely, some graphic designers are excited that the Next program will allow developers to create Mac software using Adobe&#39;s Display PostScript programming language. With software written in this language, computer users are able to view images nearly exactly as they appear when printed out -- a valuable function for graphic artists and designers.
<P>    For its part, Apple played up the fact that the Next operating program, now used by some companies to create World Wide Web sites, will help expand its foothold in this potentially lucrative business market.
<P>    Jobs&#39; personality is another issue. The brash, passionate inventor left Apple under a dark cloud in 1985, essentially ousted after a power struggle with then-chief executive John Sculley. Since then, Apple&#39;s notoriously free-wheeling culture has been subdued under new chief executive Gilbert Amelio. Whether Jobs can adopt in his new role leading the operating system overhaul is a focus of some worry.
<P>    But like its creator the Mac, even in its current form, still inspires passion among artists, photo retouchers and others who regularly play with images and color on the computer screen.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s almost like an affection for their computer,&#39;&#39; said Chiachiere. &#39;&#39;Their computer smiles when they turn it on.&#39;&#39;

<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>

        sportswriter</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">A</font>fter playing three games in 72
        hours, Hampton Roads' tank figured to be on empty. </p>
        <p>The Admirals, coming off a hard-fought 3-2 win at
        South Carolina on Saturday night, boarded their bus for a
        seven-hour ride to Knoxville and a matinee battle with
        the well-rested Cherokees. </p>
        <p>However, coach John Brophy's team wiped the sleep from
        their eyes and beat the floundering Cherokees 7-3 before
        3,093 disappointed fans at Civic Coliseum on Sunday. </p>
        <p>''We'll still have something left,'' Hampton Roads
        assistant Al MacIsaac said before warmups. He was right. </p>
        <p>A pair of shorthanded goals by Andy Weidenbach and
        another by Ryan Mulhern were the backbreakers as far as
        Knoxville was concerned. </p>
        <p>In addition to getting burned three times with the man
        advantage, the Cherokees' power play was a dismal 1-for-8
        against the East Coast Hockey League's most-penalized
        team. </p>
        <p>Dominic Maltais also had two goals and Rod Taylor the
        other for the Admirals (19-9-2), who captured six of
        eight points -- the only blemish was a home-ice loss to
        Raleigh -- during the diabolical stretch. </p>
        <p>Even the crusty Brophy was impressed. He flashed a two
        thumbs-up sign as he exited the rink. </p>
        <p>''It's never an easy win in this place,'' he said.
        ''(This shows) when we're all together we have a great
        hockey club.'' </p>
        <p>Knoxville is digging itself a grave in the Eastern
        Division. The Cherokees (11-14-1), have lost seven in a
        row, including back-to-back losses at home. </p>
        <p>They appeared lethargic from the get-go. Two goals by
        Vaclav Nedomansky and another by Ole Kjenstad did little
        to temper the disaster. </p>
        <p>The doors to the locker room were closed again by
        coach Barry Smith to discuss the team's poor play. </p>
        <p>''Guys just want to point fingers and no one wants to
        look in the mirror and say 'I'm not doing my job. I'm not
        doing my best,' '' a dejected forward Chris Fess said.
        ''I'm not pointing my finger at anyone because it starts
        with me.'' </p>
        <p>Fess says a couple of days off for Christmas ''away
        from each other'' will provide relief. </p>
        <p>''Right now everyone is at each other's throat,'' he
        said. </p>
        <p>The Cherokees are in the grips of a funk similar to
        the one they endured about a year ago. But the 1995-96
        team regrouped. Knoxville won 18 of 21 games after Jan. 1
        and qualified for the playoffs. </p>
        <p>Jim Brown, who like Fess was a member of that resilent
        team, believes this year's situation is more desperate. </p>
        <p>''Definitely,'' Brown said. ''It's the worst feeling
        ever. Last year we knew why we were losing. We knew what
        we had to correct and we corrected it.'' </p>
        <p>Knoxville's defense is the crux of the trouble. The
        Cherokees have allowed a league-high 142 goals. </p>
        <p>''It's obvious we are missing some key guys, Kelly
        (defenseman Hollingshead), Kent (defenseman Fearns) and
        Wayne (captain Anchikoski),'' Brown said. ''We're at a
        point where we can't wait until those guys come back. We
        have to do things on our own. </p>
        <p>''Maybe they guys are mentally drained from all the
        (expletive) that's been going on around here. Maybe the
        holidays will turn it around for us and we'll come back
        with a brand new attitude.'' </p>
        <p>Knoxville's power play also is in need of an overhaul.
        The Cherokees, who connect at 15.2 percent -- only
        Richmond at 14.0 is worse -- managed Kjenstad's lone
        goal. Only Johnstown (14) has allowed more shorthanded
        goals than the Cherokees (nine). </p>
        <p>And while some fans have lost confidence in coach
        Smith, Brown remains steadfast in his corner. </p>
        <p>''I have my faith in the man,'' Brown said. ''We've
        had our meetings and I haven't been playing well and I
        knew there was a possibility I might be traded. My
        confidence is in his hands.'' </p>
        <p>It's not a festive time to be a Cherokee. </p>
        <p>''Everyone is going to have this (losing streak) on
        their mind,'' Fess sa

        A year ago worshipers at Copper Ridge Baptist Church
        rejoiced at the wondrous appearance of shining crosses in
        their sanctuary windows. </p>
        <p>Today, the crush of attention created by the crosses
        has members of the little Halls church trading barbs and
        calling out the law. </p>
        <p>Congregation members complain the Rev. Joe Bullard is
        trying to snatch the light and shine it on himself. They
        accuse him of pocketing ''love offerings'' left by church
        visitors, some from as far away as New Zealand, for
        personal expenses without their consent. </p>
        <p>''I don't mind people coming in to see the crosses,''
        says Barbara Shoemaker, a church trustee and longtime
        Copper Ridge member. But she draws the line at Bullard's
        appearances in supermarket tabloids and on radio talk
        shows. </p>
        <p>''We don't approve of that in a Baptist minister.'' </p>
        <p>Bullard, who guesses he has welcomed more than 48,000
        people to Copper Ridge in the past year, says he hates to
        see his flock in a squabble. The 65-year-old retired
        railroader, who took up preaching when he was 14, insists
        he was ready to step down next month until some in the
        congregation started telling lies. </p>
        <p>''I have to stay and fight this now,'' says Bullard,
        propped on a pew, a sunbeam blazing above his head. </p>
        <p>Last month, 11 church members took the extraordinary
        step of suing Bullard and his family in Knox County
        Chancery Court. The matter has yet to come before a
        judge, and at one point this month members thought they'd
        reached a settlement. </p>
        <p>The agreement collapsed, however, and now church
        members appear to be in a standoff. Knox County Sheriff's
        Department deputies were called last week to keep the
        peace at Wednesday's service. </p>
        <p>Among the biggest issues in the brawl is how often the
        church, which can be viewed every night and by
        appointment in the day, should be open to outsiders. Some
        members want to limit access. </p>
        <p>Donna R. Davis, Bullard's lawyer, said the reverend
        feels the crosses are so special that anyone who might
        benefit from them should be allowed to see them. </p>
        <p>''Most ministers don't close the doors to their
        churches,'' Davis said Friday. ''Ministers, in the course
        of ministering, open their arms to everyone.'' </p>
        <p>For more than 120 years the simple, white church has
        sat perched on a hill on Majors Road. It began as a
        Methodist church and became Copper Ridge Baptist Church
        in the early 1970s, with Bullard joining in 1983. It has
        about three dozen active members. </p>
        <p>By Bullard's reckoning, Wednesday, Nov. 8, 1995, was
        the day everything changed. It was on that day, he says,
        as he was getting ready to preach, that he saw a
        ''beautiful cross'' shining through the window. </p>
        <p>He claims it has nothing to do with the glass, which
        has the same textured surface often used to ensure
        privacy in bathroom windows. Church literature claims the
        glass has been in place 27 years. </p>
        <p>Nor did the discovery have anything to do with a new
        streetlight, which was installed outside in September
        1995, he said. </p>
        <p>''My wife and I, we've washed those windows time and
        time again,'' Bullard said. ''Before, never was anything
        seen out of those windows.'' </p>
        <p>Neither the preacher nor parishioners make a claim as
        to what the crosses mean. But they all agree visitors
        have had spiritual experiences after viewing them. Monks
        have even chanted on the floor. At least one person was
        cured of brain cancer, Bullard says. </p>
        <p>While Copper Ridge does not expect donations, gifts
        gladly are accepted in a black tackle box. </p>
        <p>Bullard has appeared on out-of-town radio shows and in
        The Sun tabloid. Publicity has grown so wide that a group
        identifying itself as Share International now highlights
        the crosses on the World Wide Web as a manifestation of
        the arrival of a new spiritual leader. </p>
        <p>On Friday, as he visited with reporters, Bullard got a
        call from a woman on his cellular telephone. </p>
        <p>There's nothing special about Copper Ridge's crosses,
        the woman said. She saw the same figure in her bathroom
        window. </p>
        <p>Bullard told her several times he was glad for her and
        would be happy to speak with her later if she wanted to
        call back. Suddenly, he drew the phone from his ear. </p>
        <p>''Well, she hung up,'' he said. </p>
        <p>By fall, a nasty schism had split the Copper Ridge
        faithful. Much of it focuses on the man in the pulpit. </p>
        <p>According to Shoemaker and others, Bullard latched
        onto the crosses as an avenue to money and fame. </p>
        <p>Member William H. Vancel of Maynardville claims in
        court documents that Bullard told him in January the
        church would ''milk the public for all we can get out of
        the crosses.'' </p>
        <p>Congregation members complain Bullard went on talk
        shows and plans to profit off a book about the crosses.
        Of his own accord, Bullard throws open the church doors,
        inviting outsiders to come every night of the week, they
        say. </p>
        <p>Some members claim he started keeping $5 or $10 from
        donations on exhibition nights for ''personal expenses''
        without their approval. </p>
        <p>When one member objected, Bullard reprimanded her,
        prompting her to leave. </p>
        <p>''I've been intimidated or harrassed by the whole
        family,'' said Shoemaker, ''It's been going on for six
        weeks.'' </p>
        <p>Vancel, Shoemaker and member M.L. Parsley claim
        Bullard is guilty of other wrongs against the
        congregation, including allowing his family to bully
        members who dared question him. </p>
        <p>Parsley said Bullard has turned his back on members
        who have sued him. </p>
        <p>''We were told from the pulpit, 'Do not speak to me,'
        '' Parsley said. </p>
        <p>In October, some members began a petition drive to get
        Bullard to leave. Letters on Copper Ridge Baptist Church
        stationery have been submitted in court showing the
        signatures of more than 20 members, active or otherwise. </p>
        <p>''You are relieved of all duties and offices of this
        church, and we ask that you vacate the premises
        immediately,'' the petitions state. </p>
        <p>Still, Bullard stays, although he says he's letting
        others deliver the gospel now. </p>
        <p>Most members want to keep him and believe the
        accusations against him are false, said lawyer Davis. </p>
        <p>Bullard is adamant, for example, that the church took
        a vote granting him $5 a night for gas expenses when he
        opened Copper Ridge to outsiders. The preacher supports a
        review of the church books, as some members have called
        for, to check out how money has been spent. </p>
        <p>It's true the pastor has appeared on radio call-in
        programs, but he's never received money for his time,
        Davis said. </p>
        <p>Shoemaker and Eileen Monroe, another member suing the
        Bullards, represent two of the church's three trustees,
        Davis said. They have the votes to rein in Bullard if
        they think he is doing something wrong. </p>
        <p>Unless Shoemaker, Parsley and the rest of the group
        agree to withdraw their lawsuit, Davis said a judge will
        have to decide if he should get involved. Tennessee law
        makes it clear judges are not the best people to resolve
        a church fight, she said. </p>
        <p>''It's clearly our position that this is not a matter
        that belongs in the courtroom,'' she said. ''It belongs
        in the church, with the members resolving it.'' </p>
        <p>Shoemaker, however, said she felt compelled to join
        the court fight against Bullard because she was tired of
        being intimidated by him. Some in the congregation think
        he's trying to run off loyal, long-standing members, she
        said. </p>
        <p>''He has hurt so many people I felt like I had to
        stand up and do what was right,'' Shoemaker said. </p>

        <font size="5">N</font>ASHVILLE -- If Rep. Tim Burchett
        gets his way, all first-time convicted child molesters in
        Tennessee would be chemically castrated. </p>
        <p>''In biblical times, they took them out and stoned
        them,'' said the Knoxville Republican. ''I'm a Christian,
        and I believe in forgiveness. But we're not seeing people
        go through therapy for child molesting. The research
        shows they're never cured.'' </p>
        <p>Burchett said he will introduce a bill to sterilize
        sex offenders of children when the session convenes on
        Jan. 14, and he said he will ''hammer it.'' He doesn't
        have a Senate sponsor yet, but he doesn't anticipate
        trouble finding one. </p>
        <p>Already, the American Civil Liberties Union is
        preparing to do battle on the constitutionality of such
        legislation. </p>
        <p>''People need to understand the crime of rape and
        molestation is typically based on violence, control and
        power, not sexual needs and drives,'' said Hedy Weinberg,
        ACLU's Tennessee director. ''Punishing people by using
        chemical castration will not protect women and children
        who are victims of these crimes.'' </p>
        <div align="left"><table border="0" cellpadding="0"
        cellspacing="6">
            <tr>
                <td width="220"><font size="5">(Burchett) insists
                castration is a proper punishment.</font></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </div><p>Weinburg said she is researching the issue,
        including a California law which applies to multiple
        offenders, before commenting further. </p>
        <p>Burchett said he is also doing further research on the
        effectiveness of the procedure. He said he does not favor
        programs that temporarily sterilize sex offenders. He
        insists castration is a proper punishment. </p>
        <p>''I think they should carry it with them the rest of
        their lives,'' he said. ''I don't know if it will reduce
        the gene pool. You're talking about taking away their
        ability to breed by castration.'' </p>
        <p>His motivation, he said, is to protect children. </p>
        <p>''We're always talking about our youth being the most
        valuable thing we've got,'' he said. </p>
        <p>And he believes the evidence is clear that molesters
        repeat their offenses. That's why he wants first
        offenders chemically castrated. </p>
        <p>''I know many people will say it's a drastic move,''
        Burchett said. ''Who's going to be opposed to it? I'm
        going to have the ACLU mad at me and the child molesters
        mad at me. So that doesn't bother me.'' </p>
        <p>He also is motivated by what he considers to be the
        ''too-light'' sentences meted to sex offenders by
        ''liberal judges'' and the fact that too many offenders
        repeat their crimes while on probation. </p>
        <p>''It will send a clear message that child molestation
        will not be tolerated in the state of Tennessee,''
        Burchett said. </p>
